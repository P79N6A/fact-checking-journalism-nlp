His lawyer told the Guardian: \"I draw your attention to the fact that Mr Cryne did not play any part in either of the trials. Therefore any reference to matters which may have been admitted by the defendants are not matters which can be imputed to Mr Cryne. He made no such admission.\" The company's purported stellar performance in 2003 came at a critical time for the business. Shortly afterwards iSoft was selected as a major sub-contractor within Labour government's \u00a312.7bn 10-year NHS IT overhaul \u2013 the largest non-military computer upgrade in the world. About the same time, a soaring share price also helped the business take over rival group Torex, which was bought with iSoft shares. Collapsed trial The case against four former iSoft directors collapsed over a missing file. The Financial Conduct Authority decided not to pursue a third trial against Stephen Graham, 49, Timothy Whiston, 45, and John Whelan, 46, after a jury was dismissed last month over a procedural problem. Patrick Cryne, 62, who had not been put on trial because of ill health, was also told that he would not be facing prosecution. It was only the second criminal case of conspiracy to mislead the markets and \u00a35m of taxpayers' money was spent on the case. The state must now pick up the defendants' legal costs. The case hit the buffers when the FCA's barrister disclosed a note from 2009 that the defence had not seen. The judge dismissed the jury and ended the trial because the defence would have needed time to study the document. The first trial collapsed in 2012 after the jury failed to reach a verdict. Commenting after the verdict, iSoft's former chief operating officer, Stephen Graham, said his life had been on hold since the investigation began in 2006. \"In that time I have had to stand by and watch the company I dedicated 20 years of my life to creating and building, systematically managed out of existence,\" Graham said.",

    "webTitle": "Mark Carney needs to watch economic warning signs while the going is good | Larry Elliott", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Mark Carney has had the dream start as governor of the Bank of England. His predecessor, Mervyn King, had his work cut out in a crisis-ridden second five-year term, grappling with a financial meltdown, a deep slump and a stuttering recovery. Carney's six weeks in Threadneedle Street have seen unemployment come down, growth pick up and \u2013 as the latest official figures showed yesterday \u2013 price pressures abate. The new captain has been piped aboard the ship just as the storm has blown over. The July fall in inflation was small but significant. There was speculation a couple of months ago that one of Carney's first tasks as governor would be to write to George Osborne explaining why inflation was more than a percentage point above the government's 2% target. That proved overly-pessimistic and after rising to 2.9% in June, inflation edged down to 2.8% in July. Further falls can be expected over the months to come as the quite chunky monthly price rises in the late summer and autumn of 2012 are replaced by smaller increases this year. Last year, prices rose by 0.5% in August, 0.4% in September and 0.5% in October, and unless there is an unexpected spike in the cost of food and fuel similar increases look improbable in 2013. Martin Beck, analyst at Capital Economics said the upshot is that inflation will be quite close to 2% by the end of the year, considerably lower than the Bank's own forecast, which shows it still hovering close to 3%. This matters both for the Bank and the wider economy. Firstly, it will suggest that the long period of above-target inflation is drawing to an end. Since 2007, the only time the annual increase in the cost of living has been running below 2% was during the winter of 2008-09 when the economy was imploding. The rest of the time, it has been above target, twice peaking at more than 5%. There is only so long a central bank can fail to meet a legally constituted inflation target without losing credibility. The second reason falling inflation matters is that it removes one of the obstacles to keeping interest rates low. Carney said last week that the Bank's monetary policy committee intended to keep the cost of borrowing at its record low of 0.5% but there were certain circumstances in which a re-think might be necessary. One of those circumstances would be a forecast that inflation in 18-24 months time would be higher than 2.5%. The Bank has never forecast inflation of higher than 2.5%, even when it was running at more than 5%, so the chances of it doing so when inflation is coming down seem remote to say the least. Finally, falling inflation helps ease the squeeze on real incomes, increasing the chances that the recovery seen in recent months will persist. This effect should not be exaggerated since even after July's fall to 2.8%, prices are still rising faster than earnings, which are going up by 1% a year. Living standards will continue to be eroded during 2013 and early 2014, but by this time next year they could start to rise as inflation falls and a growing economy leads to higher pay settlements. Further out, the risk is that inflationary pressure starts to increase again. The fall in sterling since the start of the financial crisis has made imports dearer. The Bank has kept interest rates ultra low for more than five years and created \u00a3375bn of electronic money through quantitative easing; the Treasury is handing out subsidies to home buyers: all the ingredients are there for a housing bubble that has spill over effects into the rest of the economy. Carney and his colleagues would be well advised to keep a close eye on what is happening to real estate, since one of the lessons of the financial crisis is that the economy can come off the rails even when the official measure of the cost of living is well behaved. Looking at official data over coming months it may be tempting to see inflation as yesterday's problem but, Britain being Britain, it is likely to be tomorrow's problem as well.",

      "body": "<p>Mark Carney has had the dream start as governor of the Bank of England. His predecessor, Mervyn King, had his work cut out in a crisis-ridden second five-year term, grappling with a financial meltdown, a deep slump and a stuttering recovery. Carney's six weeks in Threadneedle Street have seen unemployment come down, growth pick up and \u2013 as the latest official figures showed yesterday \u2013 price pressures abate. The new captain has been piped aboard the ship just as the storm has blown over.</p> <p>The July fall in inflation was small but significant. There was speculation a couple of months ago that one of Carney's first tasks as governor would be to write to George Osborne explaining why inflation was more than a percentage point above the government's 2% target. That proved overly-pessimistic and after rising to 2.9% in June, inflation edged down to 2.8% in July.</p> <p>Further falls can be expected over the months to come as the quite chunky monthly price rises in the late summer and autumn of 2012 are replaced by smaller increases this year. Last year, prices rose by 0.5% in August, 0.4% in September and 0.5% in October, and unless there is an unexpected spike in the cost of food and fuel similar increases look improbable in 2013.</p> <p>Martin Beck, analyst at Capital Economics said the upshot is that inflation will be quite close to 2% by the end of the year, considerably lower than the Bank's own forecast, which shows it still hovering close to 3%.</p> <p>This matters both for the Bank and the wider economy. Firstly, it will suggest that the long period of above-target inflation is drawing to an end. Since 2007, the only time the annual increase in the cost of living has been running below 2% was during the winter of 2008-09 when the economy was imploding. The rest of the time, it has been above target, twice peaking at more than 5%. There is only so long a central bank can fail to meet a legally constituted inflation target without losing credibility.</p> <p>The second reason falling inflation matters is that it removes one of the obstacles to keeping interest rates low. Carney said last week that the Bank's monetary policy committee intended to keep the cost of borrowing at its record low of 0.5% but there were certain circumstances in which a re-think might be necessary. One of those circumstances would be a forecast that inflation in 18-24 months time would be higher than 2.5%. The Bank has never forecast inflation of higher than 2.5%, even when it was running at more than 5%, so the chances of it doing so when inflation is coming down seem remote to say the least.</p> <p>Finally, falling inflation helps ease the squeeze on real incomes, increasing the chances that the recovery seen in recent months will persist. This effect should not be exaggerated since even after July's fall to 2.8%, prices are still rising faster than earnings, which are going up by 1% a year. Living standards will continue to be eroded during 2013 and early 2014, but by this time next year they could start to rise as inflation falls and a growing economy leads to higher pay settlements.</p> <p>Further out, the risk is that inflationary pressure starts to increase again. The fall in sterling since the start of the financial crisis has made imports dearer. The Bank has kept interest rates ultra low for more than five years and created \u00a3375bn of electronic money through quantitative easing; the Treasury is handing out subsidies to home buyers: all the ingredients are there for a housing bubble that has spill over effects into the rest of the economy.</p> <p>Carney and his colleagues would be well advised to keep a close eye on what is happening to real estate, since one of the lessons of the financial crisis is that the economy can come off the rails even when the official measure of the cost of living is well behaved. Looking at official data over coming months it may be tempting to see inflation as yesterday's problem but, Britain being Britain, it is likely to be tomorrow's problem as well.</p>",

      "bodyText": "How big is too big for a banking system? It is a question that has been posed many times since the 2008 crisis when the phrase \"too big to fail\" entered the lexicon as taxpayers were forced to bail out their banks or face financial meltdown. Eurozone banks, despite shrinking their balance sheets by \u20ac2.9tn (\u00a32.5tn) since May 2012, are still more than three times the size of the 17 economies using the single currency. Alberto Gallo, head of European macro credit research at Royal Bank of Scotland, reckons this is still too large. In a recent research note, he argues that despite shrinking by 8% eurozone banks are only halfway to reaching sustainable levels and need to \"deleverage\" by a further \u20ac3.2tn. Some \u20ac661bn of this will come from the 11 largest banks but the bulk of it \u2013 \u20ac2.6tn \u2013 will come from the smaller institutions, which will find it harder to \"deleverage\" as quickly as the bigger banks. This deleveraging can take place in two main ways. Either banks raise capital (by tapping shareholders or holding on to their profits, say) or they can reduce their assets by pulling out of business lines and cutting back on lending. In practice they do a combination of the two and Gallo estimates that the 11 major banks will need to raise \u20ac47bn of capital. If the UK's banks are added then the total amount of extra capital needed is \u20ac60bn \u2013 and that is on top of the \u20ac661bn reduction of assets the banks need to do in the next three to five years. Gallo's calculations are based on 70% of the deleveraging coming from raising capital and 30% by reducing assets. But for the smaller banks he estimates that only 30% can be achieved by raising capital. This begs the question of how the banks finance a recovery in the eurozone while they are drastically shrinking their balance sheets. Gallo points out that policymakers in Europe have already devised a scheme intended to help bolster lending to small and medium-sized businesses by up to \u20ac100bn in the next six years. But deleveraging is necessary if banks are to become smaller relative to the size of economies and to meet tougher rules being imposed on banks. Gallo reckons a better sized \u2013 and safer \u2013 banking system would be two to three times bigger than GDP. Banks in Canada, Australia and Japan are around twice the size of their domestic economies, he points out, while in the US banks are smaller than the size of the economy, partly due to the fact that big companies go straight to the bond markets to raise money to a greater extent than they do in other countries. For the UK Gallo's charts show that the banks are five times the size of the economy. He argues that this includes big international players and stripping out half of HSBC, 90% of Standard Chartered and 70% of Barclays, the UK banking system becomes about 3.5 times the size of the economy. This makes Gallo less worried about the UK banking system than that of the eurozone. Still, the numbers seem too big.",

      "bodyText": "The US Justice Department on Tuesday moved to block the $11bn merger of American Airlines and US Airways, arguing the deal could reduce competition in local markets and result in higher airfares. The proposed deal would create the world's largest airline and would leave four airlines in control of 80% of the US's commercial air travel market. The Justice Department said a merger would \"substantially lessen competition for commercial air travel\". AMR, AA's parent company, and US Airways announced their merger in February, and had hoped to complete the deal within months. The merger would be the seventh since 2005 in the rapidly consolidating industry. \"By challenging this merger, the Department of Justice is saying that the American people deserve better,\" said attorney general Eric Holder. \"This transaction would result in consumers paying the price \u2013 in higher airfares, higher fees and fewer choices.\" \"If this merger goes forward, even a small increase in the price of airline tickets, checked bags or flight change fees would result in hundreds of millions of dollars of harm to American consumers,\" said Bill Baer, assistant attorney general in charge of the Department of Justice's antitrust division. \"Both airlines have stated they can succeed on a standalone basis and consumers deserve the benefit of that continuing competitive dynamic.\" The lawsuit was filed on behalf of the attorneys general of Arizona, Florida, Tennessee, Texas, Pennsylvania and the District of Columbia. The DOJ singled out Washington, DC, as an example of its concerns about the merger. The merged airline would control 69% of takeoff and landing slots at Washington Reagan national airport and would have a monopoly on 63% of the nonstop routes served out of Reagan. \"As a result, Washington area passengers would likely see higher prices and fewer choices if the merger is allowed,\" the department said in its complaint. In a joint statement released Tuesday afternoon, the airlines vowed to mount a \"vigorous and strong defense\" to the Justice Department: We believe that the DOJ is wrong in its assessment of our merger. Integrating the complementary networks of American and US Airways to benefit passengers is the motivation for bringing these airlines together. Blocking this procompetitive merger will deny customers access to a broader airline network that gives them more choices,\" they said. The justice department has not challenged an airline merger since 2000's proposed United-US Airways merger. Since then United and Continental have merged, as have Delta and Northwest. When the deal was announced non-profit group American Antitrust Institute (AAI) called for an investigation, arguing it would substantially reduce competition on a number of routes and deprive smaller communities of air service. According to an AAI study published with the Business Travel Coalition ticket prices rose 20% on some key Delta routes and 30% on several United-Continental routes after their mergers. Bert Foer, AAI president, said he was \"surprised and delighted\" by the Justice Department's move. \"There are some pretty good arguments here that the mergers have gone far enough,\" he said. Foer said he believed the chances of the merger going through without \"major changes\" was slim. \"The Justice Department is saying there is a national issue here. There are so few players. It's not about a few overlapping routes or minor compromises,\" he said. The action is the second high profile anti-trust move from the Justice Department this year. The agency moved to block brewing giant Anheuser Busch Inbev's $20.1 bn acquisition of Mexico's Grupo Modelo earlier this year. That deal was modified to win approval.",

It's not about a few overlapping routes or minor compromises,\" he said.</p> <p>The action is the second high profile anti-trust move from the Justice Department this year. The agency moved to block brewing giant Anheuser Busch Inbev's $20.1 bn acquisition of Mexico's Grupo Modelo earlier this year. That deal was modified to win approval.</p>",

The company announced his departure Tuesday less than a week after Ackman had demanded the resignation of its chairman and CEO. The retailer has appointed Ronald Tysoe, former vice-chairman of Federated Department Stores Inc, now Macy's Inc, to its board and is seeking another director. \"At this time, I believe that the addition of two new directors and my stepping down from the board is the most constructive way forward for JC Penney and all other parties involved,\" Ackman said in a statement released by the company. Ackman's Pershing Square Capital is the retailer's largest shareholder and has been a persistent critic of the company's management. Pershing started buying shares three years ago at prices well above the $12.70 they now trade for, and has lost as much as $600m on its investment. Last week Ackman called for chairman Thomas Engibous and interim chief executive Myron Ullman to step down. Announcing Ackman's departure the company said its board had given its \"overwhelming support\" to the executives. Ullman, 64, is a former Penney chief executive who was rehired following the departure of Ron Johnson, former head of Apple's stores, whose disastrous tenure led to a dramatic drop in sales at the stores group. Sales at JC Penney fell 25% in 2012 and the company reported a $1bn loss as Johnson got rid of the discounting for which the company is famous. Ullman was appointed on a temporary basis after Johnson's departure and the search for his successor continues. Ackman's resignation will give Pershing Square more flexibility should it decide to begin selling its stake in the company. The company's shares initially rose in reaction to the news but lost the gains by mid-morning.",

Photograph: Pool/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In the UK, the data schedule is busy too tomorrow. <strong>Minutes from the latest <a href=\"http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/Pages/home.aspx\">Bank of England</a> meeting</strong> and <strong>unemployment</strong> data from the <a href=\"http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/index.html\">Office of National Statistics</a> are both out at 9.30am. After BoE governor Mark Carney announced last week that rates will stay low until unemployment comes down to 7%, the labour market data will be subject to much more market scrutiny than of old.</p> <p>As <strong>Alan Clarke, economist at Scotiabank</strong> comments:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The ILO unemployment rate series has now achieved <strong>A-list celebrity status</strong> following the announcement that the BoE will not raise Bank Rate at least until unemployment has fallen below 7%.</p> <p>There could even be fireworks as soon as this week\u2019s labour report. Indeed, we expect the rate to fall from 7.8% to 7.7%. <br>The make or break this month is the level of unemployment needs to fall by 6k or more on the month (consistent with a -20k reading on the 3-month change basis). Given the performance of the claimant count measure of unemployment (which is released a month ahead of the ILO data) there is good reason to expect a good number from the ILO measure.</p> </blockquote> <p>The consensus forecast is for the unemployment rate to have held at 7.8%. Average earnings growth (without bonuses) is expected to have edged up to an annual 1.1% from 1.0%. That is still way below the CPI measure of inflation at 2.8% and RPI measure at 3.1%, as <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/aug/13/eurozone-crisis-uk-inflation-us-retail-sales#block-5209fddae4b0528670b2154f\">covered earlier</a>.</p> <p>The BoE minutes are expected to show the vote on the monetary policy committee to hold rates at the record low of 0.5% was a unanimous 9-0 as was the vote on keeping quantitative easing where it is.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-520a4776e4b0adc725a83550\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-08-13T14:49:30.766Z\">3.49pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">A look ahead to GDP day</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Good afternoon, Katie Allen here taking over from my colleague Angela Monaghan. As she mentioned earlier, news of a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/aug/13/eurozone-crisis-uk-inflation-us-retail-sales#block-520a0145e4b002500e0034cf\">pick-up in industrial production</a> in the eurozone earlier today has bolstered expectations that the currency bloc will be shown to have finally exited recession when official GDP data are released in the morning.</p> <p>Here is a round-up of tomorrow's main data releases in the eurozone:</p> <p><strong>France kicks things off with second quarter GDP</strong> numbers at<strong> 6.30am</strong> UK time. The consensus forecast in the Reuters poll of economists is for quarterly growth of 0.2% after a drop of 0.2% in the first quarter. French July inflation figures are at 7.45am.</p> <p>At <strong>7.00am</strong>, <strong>German second quarter GDP</strong> data is expected to show quarterly growth of 0.6% after 0.1% in the first quarter.</p> <p>Austrian, Dutch and Portuguese GDP data are also due out.</p> <p>The focus will be on second quarter GDP data for the whole eurozone, due at 10.00am. Economists expect growth of 0.2% after a decline of 0.2% in the first quarter. Following today's industrial production data, <strong>Peter Vanden Houte at ING Financial Markets</strong> sends through this comment on tomorrow's likely numbers.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>With a 1.2% quarter-on-quarter increase, the industrial production figure is compatible with a 0.3% GDP expansion in the second quarter. This would mark the end of the 6 quarter recession in the eurozone.<br>Today\u2019s report shows that the recession has probably ended in the eurozone. However, with a new bail-out needed in Greece and the economic situation still fragile in most of the peripherals, a subdued recovery is probably the best we can hope for.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-520a3ba7e4b00b71618f5501\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-08-13T13:59:03.729Z\">2.59pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">European markets are still slightly higher</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>FTSE 100: +0.2% at 6585</strong></p> <p><strong>CAC 40: +0.3% at 4083</strong></p> <p><strong>DAX 30: +0.6% at 8410</strong></p> <p><strong>IBEX: +0.1% at 8728</strong></p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-520a36c2e4b00b71618f54fe\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-08-13T13:38:10.708Z\">2.38pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">US markets open higher</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>US markets have opened up slightly:</p> <p><strong>DOW JONES: +0.2% at 15,451</strong></p> <p><strong>S&amp;P 500: +0.1% at 1,691</strong></p> <p>Meanwhile the <strong>dollar</strong> has strengthened on the back of the US retail sales figures, with the underlying picture better than the headline monthly rise of 0.2% suggested.</p> <p>Here is an extract from the<a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/08/13/us-markets-forex-idUSBRE97402V20130813\"> Reuters</a> story:</p> <p><em>The dollar climbed to a one-week high against both the euro and the yen on Tuesday after a key gauge of US consumer spending rose at its fastest pace in seven months, strengthening the case for the US Federal Reserve to wind down stimulus.</em></p> <p><em>Retail sales outside of cars, gasoline and building materials rose 0.5% last month, the Commerce Department said on Tuesday.

This inflation outlook means real average earnings are likely to remain under pressure, which in turn should limit the recovery in consumer demand, despite the recent improvement in household optimism.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Howard Archer</strong> of <strong>IHS Global Insight</strong> says the fall is only \"moderately\" helpful.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Following the recent good news on growth, some moderately encouraging developments on the inflation front as consumer price inflation dipped to 2.8% in July from 2.9% in June. This slightly eases the squeeze on consumers\u2019 purchasing power, although it currently remains appreciable given that inflation is still running nearly three times above underlying annual average earnings growth of 1.0% in the three months to May.</p> <p>Looking ahead, consumer price inflation may yet touch 3.0% in the near term given difficult near-term base effects and recently firmer oil prices.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Alan Clarke</strong> of <strong>Scotiabank</strong> also warns that petrol price rises are yet to feed through:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The recent rise in petrol prices was only partly captured by today\u2019s release \u2013 the bulk of that impact will come next month. It won\u2019t push inflation higher, it will just prevent the slowdown that we would otherwise have had.</p> </blockquote> <p>However <strong>Martin Beck</strong> of <strong>Capital Economics</strong> thinks this is the beginning of further falls:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>July\u2019s fall in annual CPI inflation from 2.9% to 2.8% is likely to presage the start of a sustained drop.

A quick summary of main indices before we close the blog for the day: FTSE 100: +0.6% at 6612 CAC 40: +0.5% at 4093 DAX 30: +0.7% at 8416 IBEX: +0.5% at 8759 DOW JONES: +0.03% at 15,425 S&amp;P 500: -0.1% at 1,689 That is all from us for now. Thanks as ever for reading and commenting. We will be back tomorrow with coverage of events from around the eurozone, the financial markets and the global economy - as reported earlier, it is a busy day on the data front with eurozone GDP figures at 10am expected to show an exit from recession. In the UK, the data schedule is busy too tomorrow. Minutes from the latest Bank of England meeting and unemployment data from the Office of National Statistics are both out at 9.30am. After BoE governor Mark Carney announced last week that rates will stay low until unemployment comes down to 7%, the labour market data will be subject to much more market scrutiny than of old. As Alan Clarke, economist at Scotiabank comments: The ILO unemployment rate series has now achieved A-list celebrity status following the announcement that the BoE will not raise Bank Rate at least until unemployment has fallen below 7%. There could even be fireworks as soon as this week\u2019s labour report. Indeed, we expect the rate to fall from 7.8% to 7.7%. The make or break this month is the level of unemployment needs to fall by 6k or more on the month (consistent with a -20k reading on the 3-month change basis). Given the performance of the claimant count measure of unemployment (which is released a month ahead of the ILO data) there is good reason to expect a good number from the ILO measure. The consensus forecast is for the unemployment rate to have held at 7.8%. Average earnings growth (without bonuses) is expected to have edged up to an annual 1.1% from 1.0%. That is still way below the CPI measure of inflation at 2.8% and RPI measure at 3.1%, as covered earlier. The BoE minutes are expected to show the vote on the monetary policy committee to hold rates at the record low of 0.5% was a unanimous 9-0 as was the vote on keeping quantitative easing where it is. Good afternoon, Katie Allen here taking over from my colleague Angela Monaghan. As she mentioned earlier, news of a pick-up in industrial production in the eurozone earlier today has bolstered expectations that the currency bloc will be shown to have finally exited recession when official GDP data are released in the morning. Here is a round-up of tomorrow's main data releases in the eurozone: France kicks things off with second quarter GDP numbers at 6.30am UK time. The consensus forecast in the Reuters poll of economists is for quarterly growth of 0.2% after a drop of 0.2% in the first quarter. French July inflation figures are at 7.45am. At 7.00am, German second quarter GDP data is expected to show quarterly growth of 0.6% after 0.1% in the first quarter. Austrian, Dutch and Portuguese GDP data are also due out. The focus will be on second quarter GDP data for the whole eurozone, due at 10.00am. Economists expect growth of 0.2% after a decline of 0.2% in the first quarter. Following today's industrial production data, Peter Vanden Houte at ING Financial Markets sends through this comment on tomorrow's likely numbers. With a 1.2% quarter-on-quarter increase, the industrial production figure is compatible with a 0.3% GDP expansion in the second quarter. This would mark the end of the 6 quarter recession in the eurozone. Today\u2019s report shows that the recession has probably ended in the eurozone. However, with a new bail-out needed in Greece and the economic situation still fragile in most of the peripherals, a subdued recovery is probably the best we can hope for. FTSE 100: +0.2% at 6585 CAC 40: +0.3% at 4083 DAX 30: +0.6% at 8410 IBEX: +0.1% at 8728 US markets have opened up slightly: DOW JONES: +0.2% at 15,451 S&amp;P 500: +0.1% at 1,691 Meanwhile the dollar has strengthened on the back of the US retail sales figures, with the underlying picture better than the headline monthly rise of 0.2% suggested. Here is an extract from the Reuters story: The dollar climbed to a one-week high against both the euro and the yen on Tuesday after a key gauge of US consumer spending rose at its fastest pace in seven months, strengthening the case for the US Federal Reserve to wind down stimulus. Retail sales outside of cars, gasoline and building materials rose 0.5% last month, the Commerce Department said on Tuesday. July's gain was the biggest since December, and suggests the economy could be regaining steam after tax hikes and federal budget cuts dragged on growth in the first half of the year. The euro was last down 0.2% at $1.3267 with the session low at $1.3255. The dollar was last up 1.2% at 98.10 yen. It was the biggest one-day percentage jump against the yen since August 1. Only last week the dollar was at seven week low against the yen. UK inflation fell to 2.8% in July from 2.9% in June, in line with economists' expectations. US retail sales rose 0.2% in July compared with a month earlier. June's rise was revised up to 0.6% from 0.4%. Eurozone industrial production increased by 0.7% in June, reinforcing expectations that data on Wednesday will confirm an escape from recession for the troubled region in the second quarter. UK house prices are rising at the fastest rate since the 2006 peak according to the RICS. The Nikkei rebounded 2.6% overnight following reports that Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe is considering a corporation tax cut. Christopher Vecchio, currency analyst at dailyfx.com, says the reaction to the US retail sales data suggests investors are expecting the Federal Reserve to start tapering quantitative easing in Q3. US retail sales rose 0.2% in July compared with the previous month. That was just below expectations of 0.3%, and lower than June's 0.6% increase (the June rise was revised up from 0.4%). The biggest increase was sales of sports goods, which were up 1% on the month according to the US Commerce Department data. Excluding cars, retail sales were 0.5% higher compared with June. James Knightley of ING says the data continue a positive trend for the US economy but fiscal concerns linger: This is the fourth consecutive monthly rise and suggests that US consumers are overcoming the headwind from fiscal tightening earlier in the year. We anticipate further gains in coming months given that consumer confidence is being supported by a strengthening labour market and wealth gains from rising property and stock markets. However, the big unknown is the fallout from any intransigence in Washington over the debt ceiling/fiscal policy. If a deal isn\u2019t done quickly the prospect of government shutdowns and public sector layoffs cold quickly prompt a reversal in sentiment and spending. Sentiment among small business owners in the US improved in July according to the National Federation of Independent Business. However a rise in the optimism index to 94.1 from 93.5 was below economists' expectations. NFIB chief economist Bill Dunkelberg was not in celebratory mood: In an attempt to 'make lemonade' from the lousy bushel of lemons the administration has handed the small-business community, owners gave the July optimism Index the great distinction of being the fourth highest reading since December 2007\u2014 when the economy slipped into official recession. Unfortunately, nothing is being done to allay the most pressing concerns identified by job creators\u2014dealing with rising health insurance costs, regulations, tax complexity, energy costs and general economic uncertainty. The President wants a deal on 'corporate taxes', but most small businesses are not incorporated. Energy policy is more confused than ever and the volume of new regulations is mounting. Should I even mention the mounting problems with Obamacare? We are in the 'tankeroo,' not sinking, but trying to stay afloat. There are some very unhappy rail passengers today as the UK inflation data confirm that fares in England will rise by an average of 4.1% in January. That means the price of many commuters' annual season tickets will rise by around \u00a3200. Prices are calculated at July's Retail Prices Index - which came in at 3.1% - plus 1 percentage point. Read the full story from our transport correspondent Gwyn Topham here. The authors of M&amp;G's Investments' Bond Vigilantes blog are feeling celebratory at the news that Monster Munch is returning to its roots by reverting to the original packet design, size, texture, and flavour. The bloggers had previously bemoaned a shrinking packet size, and welcome a rare victory for consumers as the makers of the tasty corn snack offer customers better value for money. James Tomlins of the blog tells us that corn prices are partly to thank: Since October 2011 the corn future has fallen by around 28.5% in price to $4.64 per bushel, a rare case of deflation in recent times. In sterling terms, the fall is around 25.5%. Accordingly, the dramatic fall off in corn prices has allowed the manufacturer to pass on part of this benefit to consumers, reducing the headline per gram price, but at the same time retaining some of the benefit in the form of an enhanced profit margin. So whilst we cannot claim all the credit for this victory, this is a rare piece of welcome news for the consumer of corn based snacks. Away from the UK, eurozone industrial output rose 0.7% in June, just shy of the 0.8% forecast by economists but a big improvement on May's 0.2% fall nevertheless. The rise in June was driven by a 4.9% increase in the production of durable consumer goods. Energy production fell by 1.6% in the eurozone in June according to the EU's statistics office Eurostat. Biggest jumps in industrial output in June: Ireland: +8.7% Germany: +2.5% Greece: +2.5% Biggest falls: Finland: -5.9% Netherlands: -4.1% Portugal: -2.8% The rise in industrial output in the eurozone reinforced expectations that the region's recession ended in the second quarter following six successive quarters of economic contraction. As stated earlier, official confirmation on that comes on Wednesday. This from Ben May of Capital Economics: June\u2019s eurozone industrial production data and August\u2019s German ZEW survey provide further signs that the eurozone has emerged from recession. Along with stronger growth in construction, this suggests that GDP probably posted a small rise of about 0.2%. But the recent upturn appears mainly to be down to firms expecting demand to rise in the future, rather than a pick-up in orders. Given this, and the fact that the industrial surveys still only point to small rises in production at best, the pace of expansion may soon ease. Read our fulll story on UK inflation here. It is worth noting that average wages rose by just 1% in the three months to May in the latest available data from the ONS. That is well below inflation so British consumers are still feeling the squeeze. Politicians have given their reaction to the inflation data. This from a Treasury spokesperson: Inflation is at nearly half of its peak of 5.2%. The economy is on the mend, but the Government understands that times are tough for families and that is why we have taken continued action to help with the cost of living: increasing the tax-free personal allowance which will take 2.7m people out of tax altogether; freezing fuel duty which has kept petrol prices 13 pence per litre lower than they would otherwise have been; and freezing council tax in every year of this Parliament. Labour begs to differ. Cathy Jamieson, shadow economic secretary to the Treasury responded with this: Today\u2019s figures confirm that prices continue to rise faster than wages as the Tory-led government's cost of living crisis continues. And the government is making things worse not better for families. Alongside declining real wages, tax rises and cuts to tax credits are hitting those on middle and low incomes while millionaires have been given a huge tax cut. Here is some reaction to this morning's data showing annual inflation fell to 2.8% in July from 2.9% in June. Simon Hayes of Barclays says inflation is likely to stay above target for a while: We do not see the fall in consumer price inflation as the start of a downward trend.We expect CPI inflation to stay close to its current level for another 12 months or so, and only to drop towards the Bank of England\u2019s 2% target in the latter part of next year. This inflation outlook means real average earnings are likely to remain under pressure, which in turn should limit the recovery in consumer demand, despite the recent improvement in household optimism. Howard Archer of IHS Global Insight says the fall is only \"moderately\" helpful. Following the recent good news on growth, some moderately encouraging developments on the inflation front as consumer price inflation dipped to 2.8% in July from 2.9% in June. This slightly eases the squeeze on consumers\u2019 purchasing power, although it currently remains appreciable given that inflation is still running nearly three times above underlying annual average earnings growth of 1.0% in the three months to May. Looking ahead, consumer price inflation may yet touch 3.0% in the near term given difficult near-term base effects and recently firmer oil prices. Alan Clarke of Scotiabank also warns that petrol price rises are yet to feed through: The recent rise in petrol prices was only partly captured by today\u2019s release \u2013 the bulk of that impact will come next month. It won\u2019t push inflation higher, it will just prevent the slowdown that we would otherwise have had. However Martin Beck of Capital Economics thinks this is the beginning of further falls: July\u2019s fall in annual CPI inflation from 2.9% to 2.8% is likely to presage the start of a sustained drop. Although there are growing signs of economic recovery, we think the degree of slack in the economy will help push down CPI inflation close to the MPC\u2019s 2% target by the end of the year. The German ZEW, a monthly measure of sentiment among investors and analysts, has risen more than expected. The economic sentiment index increased to 42 in August from 36.3 in July, reaching its highest level since March and beating expectations of a more modest rise to 40. The current conditions index rose to 18.3 from 10.6, against expectations of a more modest rise to 12. The German think-tank which publishes the monthly survey said: First signs of an end to the recession in important eurozone countries may have contributed to the indicator\u2019s rise. This is also reflected by the strong increase of economic expectations for the eurozone. Furthermore, the economic optimism is supported by the robust domestic demand in Germany. Official figures published on Wednesday are expected to show the eurozone finally emerged from recession in the second quarter, with 0.2% growth. The annual rate of inflation fell to 2.8% in July, from 2.9% in June according to the Office for National Statistics's Consumer Prices Index. That was exactly in line with economists' expectations. The Retail Prices Index fell to 3.1% from 3.3%, again in line with forecasts. The largest drivers of the fall were air fares, plus price movements in the recreation and culture, and clothing and footwear sectors. A rise in petrol and diesel prices partially offset the fall, the ONS said. Despite the fall, CPI inflation remains above the Bank of England's 2% target. Meanwhile annual UK factory gate inflation rose to 2.1% in July from 2% in June. On a monthly basis prices were up 0.2% compared with 0.1% in June. In case you missed it, there was a bullish report on the UK housing market from the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors overnight. It will no doubt give critics of the government's Help to Buy scheme further ammunition. Business secretary Vince Cable and the former Bank of England governor Lord King are among those to have voiced concerns over a potential housing bubble. Citigroup economist Michael Saunders said the RICS report is consistent with annual house price inflation reaching 10%-plus in the next couple of quarters. Here is an extract from the Guardian's story on the RICS survey from economics reporter Katie Allen: George Osborne's schemes to kickstart house sales have fuelled a surge in interest from homebuyers and the fastest rise in prices since their peak seven years ago, according to a wide-ranging survey of estate agents. In the latest indication that a recovery in the property market is under way, the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors said that Help to Buy and other initiatives have prompted the sector to \"turn a corner\" after its post-recession slump. Its monthly report says prices are up for a fourth consecutive month as buyers return to the market in their biggest numbers for four years. Read the full story here.

FTSE 100: +0.6% at 6611 CAC 40: +0.2% at 4079 DAX 30: +0.6% at 8412 IBEX: +0.3% at 8748 A quick look at what's coming up later today: UK inflation - 9.30am UK factory gate inflation - 9.30am Eurozone industrial production - 10am German ZEW survey - 10am US NFIB small business survey - 12.30pm US retail sales - 1.30pm Read our preview of UK inflation data for July here. The Office for National Statistics data expected to show a slight easing in price pressures, with the annual rate falling to 2.8% from 2.9% in June. Next up, Germany's ZEW survey is expected to show an improvement in economic sentiment and current conditions according to analysts and investors after an unexpected deterioration last month. Eurozone industrial production data for June are expected to show monthly growth of 0.8% after a decline of 0.3% the month before. Finally, in the US, retail sales data for July are expected to show a 0.3% rise after June's 0.4% increase. Germany's annual rate of inflation on the consumer prices index was 1.9% in July, up from 1.8% in June and in line with expectations. It was the highest rate since December 2012. A breakdown of the data from the statistics agency showed annual food inflation is now running at 5.1% in Germany, the highest level in almost five years. The price of \"edible oils and fats\", including butter, was 30.8% higher in July than a year earlier. Good morning all. Welcome to our rolling coverage of the latest events across the eurozone, the financial markets and the global economy. Japan's Nikkei rebounded strongly after those disappointing GDP numbers drove the index lower on Monday. It closed up 2.6% on Tuesday at 13,867.00. The reason for renewed optimism? Another dose of Abenomics. Rumours were rife that Prime Minister Shinzo Abe is considering a corporate tax cut to offset the potential drag of a planned sales tax hike. Reports overnight suggested Abe has called for a study on lowering the rate, which at 38% is one of the highest in the industrial world. The hope would no doubt be that cutting the rate would lead to increased capital expenditure, an area which has been dragging growth in the country down.",

The slowdown will bolster expectations that inflation is now heading lower after being above its 2% target for several years.</p> <p>The Treasury welcomed the slowdown in inflation and sought to highlight moves such as freezing fuel duty as it contended with continued criticism over deteriorating household finances. A spokesperson said: \"Inflation is at nearly half of its peak of 5.2%. The economy is on the mend, but the government understands that times are tough for families and that is why we have taken continued action to help with the cost of living.\"</p> <p>But opposition Labour rebuffed government claims to be helping ease the burden of falling real wages.</p> <p>Cathy Jamieson, Labour's shadow economic secretary to the Treasury said: \"The government is making things worse not better for families.

      "bodyText": "Inflation fell in July but remains well in excess of pay rises for the average British worker, leaving many households struggling with falling incomes. The consumer price index (CPI) measure of the cost of living remained well above the Bank of England's government-set target, at 2.8%, while the broader retail price index (RPI), the measure of inflation used to set rail fares, was 3.1%. This means rail passengers now face fare rises of more than 4% in the new year. Official statistics showed the RPI, which is also used to set many pay deals, eased to 3.1% in July from 3.3% in June. Both measures far outstripped average pay growth. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said CPI fell to 2.8% from 2.9% in June, as forecast by economists. The slowdown will bolster expectations that inflation is now heading lower after being above its 2% target for several years. The Treasury welcomed the slowdown in inflation and sought to highlight moves such as freezing fuel duty as it contended with continued criticism over deteriorating household finances. A spokesperson said: \"Inflation is at nearly half of its peak of 5.2%. The economy is on the mend, but the government understands that times are tough for families and that is why we have taken continued action to help with the cost of living.\" But opposition Labour rebuffed government claims to be helping ease the burden of falling real wages. Cathy Jamieson, Labour's shadow economic secretary to the Treasury said: \"The government is making things worse not better for families. Alongside declining real wages, tax rises and cuts to tax credits are hitting those on middle and low incomes while millionaires have been given a huge tax cut.\" Business groups welcomed signs that inflation is now coming down but said there were still risks price pressures could tick higher. \"There is now greater hope that increases in inflation above the 3% mark will be avoided, but the situation remains uncertain and renewed surges in energy prices could push inflation up again,\" said David Kern, chief economist at the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC). Some economists predict inflation could be back at 2% by the end of the year. July's fall was \"likely to presage the start of a sustained drop\", said Martin Beck at Capital Economics. \"Other indicators point to further falls in inflation ahead. For example, producer prices figures also released today confirmed that price pressures at the very start of the inflation pipeline remain subdued. Looking forward, although there are growing signs of economic recovery, we think the degree of slack in the economy will help push down CPI inflation close to the monetary policy committee's 2% target by the end of the year.\" The ONS said the slowdown in inflation came as higher petrol prices were outweighed by airfares rising less than a year ago and prices in the recreation and culture sector falling. There was also downward pressure on inflation from clothing, with prices dropping by more than a year ago. Tuesday's official inflation numbers will be used to calculate January's rail fare rises across the network based on the formula of RPI plus one percentage point. That means regulated fares will likely rise by more than 4% at the start of 2014, adding more than \u00a3200 to the annual price of commuters' tickets in the south-east of England. That will put further strain on workers contending with the biggest squeeze on living standards for decades as pay rises fail to keep pace with rises in the cost of living. Average pay growth stands at 1%, according to the ONS. \"This slightly eases the squeeze on consumers' purchasing power, although it currently remains appreciable given that inflation is still running nearly three times above underlying annual average earnings growth,\" said Howard Archer, economist at IHS Global Insight. \"Looking ahead, consumer price inflation may yet touch 3.0% in the near term given difficult near-term base effects and recently firmer oil prices \u2026 but it should start heading gradually down towards the end of the year.\" This latest easing in inflation will bring reassurance to the Bank of England and new governor Mark Carney, who last week vowed to keep interest rates at their record low.
