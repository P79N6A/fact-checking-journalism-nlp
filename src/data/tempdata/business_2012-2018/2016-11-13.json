      "bodyText": "The former finance director of British software group Autonomy has been accused by US prosecutors of \u201cintimidating, pressuring, and paying off\u201d individuals who questioned his company\u2019s financial practices. In a 12-page indictment, filed on Thursday and seen by the Guardian, Sushovan Hussain is alleged to have masterminded an elaborate financial fraud designed to deceive investors, analysts, regulators, and auditors. Following a four-year investigation by the US Department of Justice, the British company director is facing a criminal trial in San Francisco. If found guilty, he could serve up to 20 years in prison and a be forced to pay multimillion-dollar penalty. Hewlett-Packard (HP), the Californian computing group, paid $11bn (\u00a38.7bn) to buy Autonomy five years ago, the biggest ever takeover of a European technology group. Mike Lynch, the Autonomy founder, collected over \u00a3517m for his shares, while Hussain received \u00a310m. HP now claims it overpaid because Autonomy\u2019s directors exaggerated the company\u2019s value. Lynch, who holds an OBE and advises the British government as a member of its council for science and technology, has not been charged. Sources said this weekend that prosecutors may be hoping to pressure Hussain into turning against his former boss and providing evidence with which to prosecute Lynch. However, an alternative source familiar with the legal process questioned this hypothesis, saying the statute of limitation would now have passed and action against Lynch could no longer be taken. Hussain is squaring up for a full-scale legal battle. He has retained John Keker, the elite US attorney who defended banned cyclist Lance Armstrong during the justice department\u2019s investigation into doping by professional cyclists. He is best known for successfully prosecuting White House aide Oliver North over the Iran-contra affair. A Vietnam veteran and marine corps leader who went on to become one of America\u2019s most formidable lawyers, Keker\u2019s other clients have included the Black Panther party leader Eldridge Cleaver and Frank Quattrone, an investment banker who overturned three trials before being exonerated over allegations linked to the stock market listing of companies during the dotcom bubble. Keker said in an emailed statement that his client would be \u201cacquitted at trial\u201d. He said Hussain was innocent of wrongdoing, had defrauded no one, and had acted at all times \u201cwith the highest standards of honesty, integrity and competence\u201d. \u201cIt is a shame that the Department of Justice is lending its support to HP\u2019s attempts to blame others for its own catastrophic failings,\u201d Keker said in the email. \u201cMr Hussain is a UK citizen who properly applied UK accounting rules for a UK company. This issue does not belong in a US criminal court.\u201d In one of the more serious claims, the indictment alleges that on 28 July 2010, Hussain \u201ccaused Autonomy to fire a finance officer in the United States who questioned whether Autonomy\u2019s financial statements were accurately stated\u201d. Prosecutors have not named the individual concerned. However, in a case brought by HP against Lynch and Hussain in London\u2019s high court last year, the employee is identified as Brent Hogenson, Autonomy\u2019s chief financial officer in the US until his dismissal on 28 July 2010. From October 2009, prosecutors allege that Hussain, together with others, \u201cengaged in a fraudulent scheme to deceive\u201d investors in Autonomy. The objective was to ensure Autonomy exceeded the quarterly projections for its revenue and profit growth, \u201cto maintain and increase the defendant\u2019s position within the company, to enrich themselves and others through bonuses, salaries and options\u201d, and to make Autonomy more attractive to potential purchasers and HP. A long list of charges claims the ex-finance director misled market analysts, made false entries in company accounts, and made \u201cfalse and misleading statements to Autonomy\u2019s regulators in response to inquiries about its financial statements\u201d. Hussain is also accused of \u201cintimidating, pressuring, and paying off persons who raised complaints about or openly criticised Autonomy\u2019s financial practices and performance\u201d. Similar claims against Hussain and Lynch were made by HP last year. The US firm, which acquired Autonomy in a doomed attempt to transform itself from a manufacturer of personal computers and printers into a more profitable software company, is suing the pair at the high court in London. HP is claiming $5.1bn in damages in what is believed to be the largest ever civil prosecution against British nationals. Its suit claims Hogenson, Autonomy\u2019s US finance chief, was dismissed after raising concerns with the firm\u2019s auditor, Deloitte, and with the then UK regulator, the Financial Services Authority (FSA). Hogenson sent an email to the FSA on 26 July 2010, allegedly raising a red flag over Autonomy\u2019s dealings with resellers of its software. Autonomy was once a leading light in \u201cSilicon Fen\u201d, the cluster of tech firms around Cambridge university. It specialised in corporate search software, designed to speed up the process of trawling through massive databases of text and audio files. Lynch is counter-suing HP for $160m, claiming the firm has ruined his reputation. Neither of the British cases is expected to go to trial before 2018. Despite claims that Hogenson attempted to blow the whistle, British regulators did not open a major investigation until February 2013, after HP had made its first complaint about accounting improprieties at Autonomy. The Serious Fraud Office, which led the investigation, dropped the case in January 2015, citing \u201cinsufficient evidence for a realistic prospect of a conviction\u201d. Lynch has placed his earnings from Autonomy into a new venture, Invoke Capital, which invests in start-up tech firms. He joined George Osborne on a trade mission to China in 2013, and is due to speak at a conference organised by the website TechCrunch in London in December.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The chairman of Royal Bank of Scotland has warned that banks could pull operations out of Britain unless Theresa May draws up transitional arrangements for the country\u2019s exit from the EU. Sir Howard Davies said it would be damaging if there was no transitional plan and that banks would have to make decisions based on uncertainty. Speaking to ITV\u2019s Peston On Sunday programme, he said the US and Japanese banks were concerned by the prospect of a hard Brexit and were drawing up contingency plans. \u201cI think it is damaging if we don\u2019t get a transitional deal because I think you will then see banks and financial institutions making decisions on the basis of uncertainty. \u201cThey will not wait because they have to make a decision which will allow them to be, to continue to function in the event of a hard Brexit if that\u2019s a possibility. \u201cSo they will not sit back, they are currently making contingency plans and once you\u2019ve got a contingency plan \u2013 hey, there is a risk you might implement it one day.\u201d Davis said the government did not need to reveal its full negotiating position, but needed to reassure the City so Britain did not encounter a \u201cjerky and sudden\u201d departure from the EU. His comments come as a group of financiers and lawyers based in Milan draw up proposals for a post-Brexit financial services centre for Europe hinged around London and the Italian city. The aim of Select Milano, an independent organisation endorsed by the Italian government, is not to steal business from London but to help financial services thrive in Europe after the UK leaves the EU. Its chief executive, Bepi Pezzulli, said one idea that was being drawn up was Dublin as satellite because the Irish legal system was closest to the principles of English law that financiers were accustomed to. \u201cI don\u2019t think destroying or fragmenting the City of London is a good way forward,\u201d said Pezzulli. \u201cDestroying a cluster is not good. We should instead enlarge the cluster and make London and Milan the head of a new cluster.\u201d The cluster is a reference to the varied businesses that are based in London, such as banking, fund management and private equity, and the services that build up around them, such as accountancy and legal services. As a result of Brexit, financial services firms operating out of London are expected to have to shift business \u2013 and jobs \u2013 to other parts of the EU to enable them to keep access to the \u201cpassport\u201d which allows them to sell products across the EU with ease. Dublin, Frankfurt, Paris and Madrid are among the cities keen to benefit from any exodus from London. There have been warnings, though, including from a Bank of England deputy governor, that New York could end up being the main beneficiary from any loss of business from London. The Bank of England deputy governor Sir Jon Cunliffe said this month that while it was possible that some activities currently carried out in London would need to move elsewhere in Europe, it would take time for any one financial centre to acquire the \u201ccluster\u201d effect of the UK capital. Select Milano is targeting one of the largest aspects of London-based business: euro-dominated clearing. Although the UK does not use the euro, London is the centre of \u20ac570bn of trading in financial products in Europe\u2019s single currency. Much of this business passes through the London Clearing House, partly owned by the London Stock Exchange, which is in the throes of a merger with Frankfurt-based Deutsche B\u00f6rse. The LSE also has links in Milan, owning the stock exchange and operating the Italian clearing house. Pezzulli, a lawyer, said: \u201cWe are not joining a queue to steal business from London.\u201d He suggested setting up a European economic interest group (EEIG), of legal entities able to operate inside and outside the EU.",

      "bodyText": "The Australian share market is set for months of volatility amid uncertainty about the trade and economic policies of incoming US president Donald Trump\u2019s policies, a leading economist has warned. The former reality TV star\u2019s election victory dominated the market moves last week with both US and Australian markets ending the week higher. The S&amp;P/ASX 200 benchmark index was up 41.9 points at 5,370.7 on Friday. But that movement is expected to pull back slightly on Monday, according to AMP Capital\u2019s chief economist, Shane Oliver. \u201cWe\u2019ll probably come off a little bit, maybe 15 points, giving up a little bit of the gains we have seen in the last week,\u201d he said. US politics would remain a strong focus throughout the week as markets continue to evaluate what his presidency will mean, the good and the bad, Oliver said. \u201cInitially markets sort of fretted about his protectionist policies and the impact on free trade,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is a lot of things in there which, despite Donald Trump\u2019s rhetoric, Wall Street actually likes.\u201d The former Australian foreign affairs minister Bob Carr has warned in the Guardian that Trump\u2019s threat to slap 45% tariffs on Chinese goods entering the US would trigger a trade war that could knock several percentage points off Chinese growth and \u201ctip Australia into recession\u201d. On Friday the region\u2019s emerging markets were hit by concerns about trade, causing a selloff on stock markets and of currencies as the US dollar soared. China\u2019s currency, the yuan, also slipped in value as Beijing fixed its rate above 6.8 to the dollar for the first time in six years. It actions will amplify concerns in the Trump team that its economic rival is a \u201ccurrency manipulator\u201d. The week ahead sees a slew of economic data in Australia and in China and Japan, which will focus investor attention. The resources giant BHP Billiton is due to hold its meeting in Brisbane on Thursday and is expected to give a positive outlook, after a steady rise in iron ore and coal prices. \u201cThe huge gains in iron ore and coal prices are going to be a bit of a bonanza for BHP profits if they\u2019re sustained and I suspect their comments on Thursday will probably reflect that,\u201d Oliver said. The latest figures on wages growth are expected to hold steady at 2.1 per cent annually, while the unemployment rate is set to rise despite solid jobs growth after a jump in participation, he said. Elsewhere, the Reserve Bank of Australia\u2019s minutes and a speech from governor Philip Lowe are expected to show the RBA is happy to leave interest rates where they are, Oliver said. \u2022 Australian Associated Press has contributed to this report",

    "sectionName": "Business", 
    "webTitle": "Argos boss plans whirlwind shop tour to boost catalogue retailer", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The new boss of Argos, John Rogers, is planning a remarkable nationwide tour in an attempt to boost staff morale and improve customer service at the catalogue retailer after it was bought by Sainsbury\u2019s. Rogers will visit eight shops a day for five days in the run-up to Christmas. Just 10 weeks into the job, Rogers has already toured numerous distribution centres, a couple of call centres and delivered parcels to people\u2019s homes. When the Guardian joined Rogers on his latest trip with a delivery driver, he had just encountered some of the challenges of the job. \u201cLast time the guy came to the door in his boxers. Everyone made sure to keep eye contact,\u201d he jokes. Rogers is working hard to turn Argos, considered by many to be one of the dying dogs of the high street, into a modern growth story for Sainsbury\u2019s. The supermarket chain paid \u00a31.4bn for Argos in September, with Rogers moving from his role as finance director of Sainsbury\u2019s to become chief executive of its new business. Argos and its new owner face their biggest test yet later this month in Black Friday, now the biggest sales day of the year for online retailers and Argos. Around 12m visitors hit the Argos site on Black Friday last year, making 18 purchases a second. Rogers expects this year to be even bigger. Over the black Friday weekend, which starts on 25 November, Brits are expected to spend 38% more than last year \u2013 or \u00a32.9bn \u2013 according to accountancy firm PwC. Argos will kick off 13 days of Black Friday deals from this Friday, 18 November. In an attempt to avoid the IT and delivery problems that have dogged some retailers in previous years, including Argos, the company has invested \u00a310m in improving its FastTrack same-day delivery service. It has added up to 200 more delivery vans, taking the total to more than 800, while its computer software has also been improved to ensure Argos can cope with surges in demand. For Black Friday itself, Argos will set up three \u201cwar rooms\u201d. One will monitor and tweak deals, one will oversee systems \u2013 standing ready to tackle any technical glitches - and the third will oversee communications with shoppers. Rogers predicts that Argos will take 70% or more of its orders online on that day, compared with 50% during normal trading, and that the company is better prepared for Black Friday than last year after rigorously testing its systems. \u201cOur underlying stability it a lot stronger. We can tap into Black Friday and know that our systems are robust,\u201d Rogers says. \u201cLast year we underestimated how digital it would be, and it was really mobile focused. People were getting on the bus in the morning, and tapping on their mobiles to see what deals they could get. This year I would expect to see the same and possibly a step up in that trend.\u201d However, he says the group\u2019s 800-plus stores, nearly 30 of which are now Sainsbury\u2019s outlets, are an important and overlooked part of the chain\u2019s future. In Rogers\u2019 eyes, one of the key things Sainsbury\u2019s can bring to Argos is expertise in customer service. \u201cSainsbury\u2019s is very good at making colleagues in stores feel really valued and in a world that is increasingly digital, stores can feel slightly forgotten. But the reality is that, although we get more and more orders online 80% of those are fulfilled in stores. Stores are still really important,\u201d he adds. Over the next three years Argos will open 250 more outlets in Sainsbury\u2019s stores. While Rogers will not confirm how many of those will replace existing outlets, analysts expect as many as half will be new stores.

      "body": "<p>The new boss of Argos, John Rogers, is planning a remarkable nationwide tour in an attempt to boost staff morale and improve customer service at the catalogue retailer after it was bought by Sainsbury\u2019s. Rogers will visit eight shops a day for five days in the run-up to Christmas.</p> <p>Just 10 weeks into the job, Rogers has already toured numerous distribution centres, a couple of call centres and delivered parcels to people\u2019s homes. When the Guardian joined Rogers on his latest trip with a delivery driver, he had just encountered some of the challenges of the job. \u201cLast time the guy came to the door in his boxers. Everyone made sure to keep eye contact,\u201d he jokes.<br></p> <p>Rogers is working hard to turn Argos, considered by many to be one of the dying dogs of the high street, into a modern growth story for Sainsbury\u2019s.<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jul/05/sainsburys-says-600-jobs-could-go-in-home-retail-group-merger\"> The supermarket chain paid \u00a31.4bn for Argos in September,</a> with Rogers moving from his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jun/10/sainsburys-finance-chief-lead-argos-john-walden\">role as finance director of Sainsbury\u2019s to become chief executive of its new business</a>.</p> <p>Argos and its new owner face their biggest test yet later this month in Black Friday, now the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/nov/11/amazon-to-spread-black-friday-sales-over-two-weeks\">biggest sales day of the year for online retailers</a> and Argos.</p> <p>Around 12m visitors hit the Argos site on Black Friday last year, making 18 purchases a second. Rogers expects this year to be even bigger. Over the black Friday weekend, which starts on 25 November, Brits are expected to spend 38% more than last year \u2013 or \u00a32.9bn \u2013 according to accountancy firm PwC. Argos will kick off 13 days of Black Friday deals from this Friday, 18 November.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/nov/27/mince-pies-not-mini-riots-cautious-shops-open-for-black-friday\">In an attempt to avoid the IT and delivery problems that have dogged some retailers</a> in previous years, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/dec/02/argos-shoppers-black-friday-delivery-delays\">including Argos</a>, the company has invested \u00a310m in improving its FastTrack same-day delivery service. It has added up to 200 more delivery vans, taking the total to more than 800, while its computer software has also been improved to ensure Argos can cope with surges in demand.<br></p> <p>For Black Friday itself, Argos will set up three \u201cwar rooms\u201d. One will monitor and tweak deals, one will oversee systems \u2013 standing ready to tackle any technical glitches - and the third will oversee communications with shoppers.</p> <p>Rogers predicts that Argos will take 70% or more of its orders online on that day, compared with 50% during normal trading, and that the company is better prepared for Black Friday than last year after rigorously testing its systems.</p> <p>\u201cOur underlying stability it a lot stronger. We can tap into Black Friday and know that our systems are robust,\u201d Rogers says. \u201cLast year we underestimated how digital it would be, and it was really mobile focused. People were getting on the bus in the morning, and tapping on their mobiles to see what deals they could get. This year I would expect to see the same and possibly a step up in that trend.\u201d</p> <p>However, he says the group\u2019s 800-plus stores, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/sep/05/sainsburys-argos-outlets-habitat-home-retail-group\">nearly 30 of which are now Sainsbury\u2019s outlets</a>, are an important and overlooked part of the chain\u2019s future.</p> <p>In Rogers\u2019 eyes, one of the key things Sainsbury\u2019s can bring to Argos is expertise in customer service.</p> <p>\u201cSainsbury\u2019s is very good at making colleagues in stores feel really valued and in a world that is increasingly digital, stores can feel slightly forgotten. But the reality is that, although we get more and more orders online 80% of those are fulfilled in stores. Stores are still really important,\u201d he adds.<br></p> <p>Over the next three years Argos will open 250 more outlets in Sainsbury\u2019s stores. While Rogers will not confirm how many of those will replace existing outlets, analysts expect as many as half will be new stores. Furthermore, the 10 Argos outlets which opened in Sainsbury\u2019s stores a year ago, before the takeover deal was agreed, are enjoying sales growth of up to 30% year-on-year.</p> <p>That growth story and the strengthened buying power of Sainsbury\u2019s, which now combines its \u00a32.5bn of clothing and home sales with Argos\u2019s \u00a34.1bn total sales, should help the group to cope with suppliers keen to raise prices following the EU referendum and the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jun/23/british-pound-given-boost-by-projected-remain-win-in-eu-referendum\">slump in the value of sterling</a>.</p> <p>\u201cOur growth trajectory can\u2019t be replicated by the competition and we can say, \u2018Come with us on this journey\u2019 [to suppliers].

    "webTitle": "We are living in a depression \u2013 that's why Trump took the White House", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Words matter. The process of understanding why Donald Trump is now heading for the White House starts with the correct description of what has happened in the eight years since Barack Obama became president. Some economists call the turbulent period that followed the collapse of Lehman Brothers the Great Recession. Others say the US along with other developed nations is experiencing secular stagnation. Anything, it seems, to avoid using the D word: depression. The dictionary definition of a depression is a sustained, long-term downturn in economic activity, which sums up precisely what has occurred since 2008. Growth rates globally have remained low despite colossal amounts of stimulus. Living standards have barely risen and the threat of deflation has loomed large. The depression since 2008 has not been as severe as that of the 1930s but there are echoes of it all the same: in the food banks that are the new soup kitchens; in the mass movements of migrants in search of a better life who are the modern equivalent of the Okies in the Grapes of Wrath; and in Trump, who has tapped into anger that has been bubbling away quietly for decades. The turning point for the average American worker came in the mid-1970s because for the first 30 years after the second world war the gains from rising prosperity were evenly shared. But this trend was broken around the time of Watergate and the end of the Vietnam war. Since 1975, productivity in the US has more than doubled, but average hourly compensation has increased by only 50%. The fruits of growth have been captured by the few, not the many. This tendency was especially pronounced in the years immediately after 2008, when lower interest rates and quantitative easing fed through into rising asset prices rather than into higher wages. Between 2009-2012, more than 90% of US growth went to the richest 1%, which included the financiers who had caused the crisis in the first place. It is not just that workers have been struggling to get a decent pay rise. Jobs have become harder to find in the last decade, with many Americans dropping out of the labour market altogether. The participation rate among prime-age males (25- to 54-year-olds) fell at the time of the crash and has never recovered. As in the UK, the outlook for working people in the US has improved over the past couple of years because the collapse of energy prices has led to lower inflation and higher real incomes. But it has not been enough to counter the feeling that the system is rigged. Torsten Bell, director of the Resolution Foundation, provided a useful breakdown of voting patterns in last Tuesday\u2019s presidential election. Taken at face value, the results seem to show that Hillary Clinton did well among those voters on the lowest incomes. She led 53%-41% among those earning less than $30,000 a year and by 51%-42% among those earning between $30,000 and $50,000. But these statistics are misleading. There was actually a 16-point net swing to the Republicans between the 2012 and 2016 elections among those earning less than $30,000 a year and a 6-point swing among those earning $30,000 to $50,000. By contrast, there was a swing to the Democrats among those on higher incomes, and this was particularly pronounced among those earning more than $100,000 a year. One interpretation of these numbers would be that Americans on average or below average incomes voted for Barack Obama in 2008 and 2012 because they expected fundamental change from which they would benefit. They were still waiting for the change to come in 2016 and thought Trump was more likely to provide it than Clinton. The better off, who have being doing just fine out of business as usual, supported Clinton as the candidate of the status quo. For Wall Street and Silicon Valley she was the safer choice. As in other western countries, the party ostensibly of the left had nothing to say that its traditional base wanted to hear. There have been three stages to this process of political estrangement. When the postwar era began, parties of the left focused exclusively on economic issues. The emphasis was on curing the ills of the 1930s: unemployment, poverty and slum housing. Governments were committed to full employment and redistribution and were prepared to use controls \u2013 on money, goods and people \u2013 to deliver those goals. Conversely, there was little appetite for fighting cultural wars. Neither Harry Truman in the US nor Clement Attlee in Britain could be described as a social liberal. The second phase came in the 1960s, when the parties of the left backed both economic and social reform. In the US, it was the era of civil rights legislation and Lyndon Johnson\u2019s Great Society programmes to tackle poverty. In Britain, the Labour government had its National Plan for the economy but also gave a fair wind to changes Attlee never delivered: the abolition of capital punishment, the decriminalisation of homosexuality, legal abortions, easier divorce and the relaxation of censorship laws. The third and final phase of this process began in the mid-1970s. Parties of the left gradually accepted defeat in the economic war and devoted their energies to winning the cultural war instead. It was taken as a given that the focus of macro-economic policy should be control of inflation rather than full employment. It was accepted that there should be as few impediments to free markets as possible, with government intervention limited to tackling any short-term problems that might arise. Curbs on trade unions introduced by parties of the right were not rolled back. Globalisation was seen as an unstoppable force that ruled out the interventionist policies of the past. Instead, the Democrats in the US and Labour in the UK limited themselves to topping up poverty wages and argued that the answer to jobs being shipped overseas was for the newly unemployed to get better qualifications. As a result, parties of the left had nothing to say when the financial crisis of 2008 exposed the weaknesses of globalised finance, debt-fuelled growth and trickle-down economics. They could point to some notable victories in the culture wars \u2013 reforms that have made the US and the UK much more tolerant countries than they were three or four decades ago. But under depression conditions that has not been enough. The failure to articulate an alternative economic strategy has led to the erosion of political support in their old heartlands, where disenchanted voters feel ignored and despised. What that means is that the political divide is now not really between left and right but between liberals who believe in free trade and free movement of people and populists who believe in the nation state and controls on the movement of goods, people and capital. That, too, has echoes of the 1930s.",

    "webTitle": "Waitrose makes a John Lewis journey with moving Christmas ad", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Waitrose has taken a leaf out of sister brand John Lewis\u2019s Christmas TV ad playbook with a heart-tugging festive campaign that tells the story of an arduous epic journey home of a young robin. The ad, like John Lewis\u2019s trampoline bouncing Buster the boxer, uses hi-tech special effects to create the robin\u2019s transcontinental Christmas migration in what Waitrose says is the \u201cmost creatively sophisticated\u201d ad it has ever made. The TV ad tells the tale of the real-life migration of a young Scandinavian robin across mountains and seas to reach his home in a UK garden to be reunited with his mate to enjoy a festive treat, a Waitrose mince pie left each year by a young girl. The 90-second commercial \u2013 made by adam&amp;eveDDB, the agency best known for making a string of famous commercials for John Lewis \u2013 has a hint of the touching epic trip concept used for John Lewis\u2019s 2012 festive tear-jerker The Journey. \u201cComing home is a central theme at Christmas when welcoming, hosting and providing a special meal for loved ones is at the heart of celebrations,\u201d said Rupert Thomas, marketing director at Waitrose, which is part of the John Lewis Partnership. \u201cIt\u2019s a story of love, courage and the importance of enjoyment with family and friends.\u201d The ad marks a new creative direction for Waitrose bearing little resemblance to its 2015 Christmas campaign, which featured a cameo from brand ambassador Heston Blumenthal and was set to Cab Calloway\u2019s 1948 jazz classic Everybody Eats When They Come To My House. Waitrose\u2019s ad, which will air for the first time on ITV during the X Factor results show on Sunday night, features an adaptation of \u201cCambridge, 1963\u201d by Icelandic composer J\u00f3hann J\u00f3hannsson from his score of film The Theory of Everything. Waitrose said every element story of the star character of the Robin, a CGI creation by special effects house The Mill, has been fact-checked to make sure it is as \u201cclose to reality and factually correct as possible\u201d. The supermarket, which spent \u00a313m on advertising in the final quarter run-up to Christmas last year, is hoping the robin might become something of a festive hit. The supermarket says there will be \u201cvarious robin-related products\u201d made available in stores, including kitchenware, clothing, toys and wrapping paper. There will also be a game, developed by the supermarket\u2019s media agency MG OMD, which will give social media followers an \u201cinteractive experience\u201d, of the robin\u2019s journey home. Waitrose is making sure all the multimedia bases are covered by also launching a book telling the story of the robin\u2019s journey in the advert is due to hit book shops from 14 November. \u201cWe\u2019re really proud of the plucky little fella and his plight to get home for Christmas,\u201d said Richard Brim, executive creative director at adam&amp;eveDDB. \u201cIt\u2019s a warming story that speaks to the spirit of togetherness in the festive season and the joy of just coming home. It feels like a great way to wrap up a great year for Waitrose.\u201d Last year, Sainsbury\u2019s released a book by Judith Kerr on the adventures of Mog the calamitous cat, the star of its Christmas TV campaign, which topped bestseller lists and raised more than \u00a31.5m for Save the Children. John Lewis sold more than \u00a32.5m of Monty merchandise, the star of its 2014 Christmas campaign, including 48,000 soft toys, some of which went for as much as \u00a3500 on eBay as stores sold out. Sainsbury\u2019s, one of the last major supermarkets still to launch its Christmas campaign, will debut this year\u2019s follow-up to the hugely popular Mog the cat ad on Monday.",

      "bodyText": "Householders are being warned to brace themselves for a rise in their electricity bills as a series of freak events conspires to send wholesale prices rocketing. Safety concerns at France\u2019s nuclear power plants operated by the energy company EDF have led to many reactors being temporarily shut down. There have been similar suspensions in Belgium. In addition, a lack of rain in Norway and Sweden \u2013 whose hydro plants generate large amounts of electricity for their European neighbours \u2013 has limited both countries\u2019 energy production. The combined effect has been to send the price at which energy companies buy their power through the roof. Last Monday, a UK energy company buying power on a next-day contract would have paid about \u00a3150 a megawatt hour. The average price a year ago was \u00a338.10. For companies that had not agreed forward contracts, the cost has soared to more than \u00a31,000. Several smaller electricity suppliers have already raised prices or withdrawn competitive tariffs. Energy analysts say it will not be long before the big operators follow if, as looks possible, this winter starts with a protracted cold snap. An index tracking the price power companies pay for electricity, produced by the consultancy Cornwall Energy, is at its highest since it started in 2012. \u201cIt is unusual for there to be significant volumes of outages in the French nuclear fleet, however this is also one of our tightest winters in recent times in terms of extra capacity, which has also influenced how high prices rise,\u201d said Cornwall analyst Tom Edwards. Twenty of EDF\u2019s nuclear reactors have been stopped for checks on their steam generators, five more than would normally be shut down for maintenance at any one time. In July, EDF was forced to lower its 2016 nuclear output target to 395-400 TWh (terrawatt hours) from 408-416 TWh because of the need for \u201cadditional controls during the second half of the year\u201d to show its reactors can operate safely. Last month, the group revised its nuclear output target again, from 380-390 TWh to 378-385 TWh. A spokeswoman said it was looking at ways to ensure it could maintain electricity generation by using its thermal and hydraulic plants. She said EDF would buy more electricity on the European wholesale markets if necessary and use \u201ccontractual flexibilities with some industrial customers and individuals to limit their electricity consumption\u201d. Edwards said supply issues were currently to blame for price rises, but extra demand could soon be a factor. \u201cThe increase was primarily driven by rising wholesale prices, so the effect will be driven by supply and demand issues,\u201d he said. \u201cIf it\u2019s a cold winter and supply issues remain, then this should persist for the next three to four months. There has been some concern raised about how suppliers will cope over the winter if they aren\u2019t able to hedge against these short-term price rises.\u201d Earlier this month, the Met Office predicted that the chance of the UK experiencing temperatures in the \u201ccold\u201d category was 30% \u2013 1.5 times the usual risk \u2013 and warned that \u201ccontingency planners and others with sensitivity to cold weather might need to consider this elevated level of risk\u201d. Larger operators that generate their own electricity can protect themselves against rising wholesale costs. But this is not so for smaller operators. Earlier this month, Southend Energy, one of the larger independent operators, announced rises of 9% and 8.4% respectively on its fixed and greener tariffs. \u201cSome suppliers have increased the price of their fixed tariffs following the recent rise in wholesale energy prices, which is putting pressure on all suppliers\u2019 costs,\u201d said a spokesman for the energy markets regulator, Ofgem, which suggested many consumers could save about \u00a3300 a year by switching. Edwards said the current uncertainty would be felt by consumers in the longer term. \u201cSuppliers will increase their standard variable tariffs if costs do rise substantially, but this will be affected by their hedging ahead of this winter. We would expect fixed tariffs in the future to be higher to take into account expected risk of short-term price volatility.\u201d",

    "webTitle": "BHS scandal: Dominic Chappell arrested amid tax investigation", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Dominic Chappell, the former owner of BHS, has been arrested as part of an investigation into unpaid taxes on profits made from the collapsed department store chain. HM Revenue &amp; Customs (HMRC) officers are understood to have arrested Chappell, 49, in a dawn raid at his home near Blandford Forum, in Dorset, south-west England. Chappell\u2019s personal company, Swiss Rock Ltd, owes more than \u00a3500,000 in tax, including \u00a3365,000 in VAT and \u00a3196,306 in corporation tax. Swiss Rock was paid at least \u00a31.6m by BHS as part of Chappell\u2019s controversial acquisition of the department store chain. HMRC refused to confirm that Chappell had been arrested. It said: \u201cWe do not comment on identifiable cases, but can confirm we have arrested a 49-year-old businessman.\u201d The arrest took place on 2 November and he has subsequently been released. Chappell did not return requests for comment. Speaking about Swiss Rock\u2019s tax bill in September, he said: \u201cThere was a return that was made in error; they [HMRC] have acted upon it and we are rectifying that as we speak.\u201d BHS collapsed into administration in April, leading to 11,000 job losses and leaving a \u00a3571m pension deficit. Chappell, a former bankrupt with no retail experience, bought BHS for \u00a31 in March 2015 from Sir Philip Green through Retail Acquisitions, a consortium of which he owned 90%. Retail Acquisitions collected an estimated \u00a317m from BHS despite owning it for just 13 months before it collapsed. Green controlled the retailer between 2000 and 2015, during which time his family and other shareholders collected more than \u00a3580m. In June, Green told MPs he would sort out the problems facing the pension scheme. However, no deal has been forthcoming and the tycoon was photographed on his new yacht during the summer. Last month, the House of Commons voted unanimously to strip Green of his knighthood, which was awarded a decade ago for services to retail. During a fiery debate in parliament, Green was lambasted and described as a \u201cbillionaire spiv\u201d. The BHS pension scheme is currently in an assessment period with the Pension Protection Fund. If a deal or settlement with Green cannot be reached, the scheme will eventually enter the PPF, where the members\u2019 benefits will be cut by at least 10%. Chappell has previously said he \u201cearned\u201d the money paid out from BHS, his \u201cconscience is very clear\u201d and his team \u201cdid the right thing, right the way through\u201d. The Pensions Regulator has started legal proceedings in an attempt to fill the BHS pension deficit, while the Financial Reporting Council and the Insolvency Service are also investigating the scandal. The Serious Fraud Office is conducting preliminary inquiries in order to consider whether to launch a formal investigation.",

Swiss Rock was paid at least \u00a31.6m by BHS as part of Chappell\u2019s controversial acquisition of the department store chain. </p> <p>HMRC refused to confirm that Chappell had been arrested.

      "bodyText": "Donald Trump mined deep discontent running through America and struck gold. The political outsider drew derision when he announced his bid for the US presidency. But Trump\u2019s protectionist, anti-immigration rhetoric and a pledge to be the \u201cgreatest jobs president that God ever created\u201d struck a chord. Momentum built and nothing could stop the Trump juggernaut, not his open xenophobia, nor claims about his tax payments \u2013 or lack thereof \u2013 and not even a sexual harassment scandal. So the electoral upset of the century has happened and for the next four years at least, the reality TV star will be swapping Manhattan\u2019s Trump Tower for the White House. In the year that the UK voted to leave the EU, Trump\u2019s triumph over Hillary Clinton was yet another outcome that pundits and pollsters had failed to predict. On financial markets, initial shock gave way to guesswork. In the post-truth world Trump has helped to build, investors are left to puzzle over what he will do once in power. Which of his most outlandish policies will become reality? Will there be a wall along the border to Mexico? Will he really target millions of immigrants for deportation? To get a flavour of the uncertainty, look no further than the stock markets, which have struggled to find a clear direction since Trump\u2019s victory was declared. Economic forecasters are being coy about whether his effect on growth will be positive or negative. A big-spending, tax-cutting president could well lift GDP. But things could go the other way if Trump follows through on his anti-trade stance and new tariffs raise costs for businesses and consumers. On the campaign trail, Trump made trade a central theme. He played into rising anger among voters who felt the spoils of globalisation were unevenly shared. For those who saw their wages depressed or their jobs move overseas, the era of free trade did more harm than good. It seems pretty certain that a Trump presidency will stall the process of trade liberalisation. He wants to renegotiate, or possibly scrap, the North American Free Trade Agreement, or Nafta, which lowers trade barriers between the US, Canada and Mexico. Other deals in doubt are the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), between 12 countries around the Pacific rim excluding China, and a proposed agreement between the US and Europe, known as the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP). On Nafta, Trump holds all the cards. Mexico needs the US more than the US needs Mexico. But when it comes to Trump\u2019s pledge to curb China\u2019s trading might, it is not so obvious he will have the upper hand. Not only is China one of the biggest economies in the world, it is a big holder of US debt. Any attempt to browbeat China, could well backfire on Trump. Time will tell whether the tycoon wants to risk a trade war with China. Just as hard to predict is what this all means for the UK as it undergoes its own upheaval and potentially breaks away from a market of 500 million people. With Trump, the UK is no longer at the back of the queue for trade deals, as Barack Obama threatened it would be during the EU referendum campaign. The incoming president has talked of his affection for Britain, so perhaps he could go for a bespoke trade deal between the US and UK. But Theresa May and her Brexiter trade minister Liam Fox will have to accept that the vastly bigger US will have the upper hand in any such talks. However, it\u2019s just as likely that trade deals of any kind will not be a priority for a president who campaigned on a pledge to put up walls. The UK might not be at the back of the queue, but it won\u2019t feature near the top of Trump\u2019s to-do list either. As we enter a new era of looking inwards, those who sought power on a protectionist platform should hope that their policies do not end up doing yet more harm.

A year of revolt There is more in common between Sir Philip Green, Mike Ashley and Donald Trump than their body shapes and wealth. Trump\u2019s victory has sparked dismay \u2013 not just at the election of a man recorded making sexist remarks but at how, when coupled with Brexit, it suggests the west has turned its back on trade. The scandals involving BHS and Sports Direct highlight why people may have come to question the benefits of tariff-fee imports and exports. While business leaders like Green and Ashley have filled their boots and expanded empires, the workers who have driven their stores\u2019 success have not shared their wealth. Green and Ashley are billionaires, but 11,000 BHS workers have lost their jobs and part of their pensions, while Sports Direct staff are stuck on zero-hours contracts. Those who have taken advantage of the freedoms offered by globalisation and the free markets have a lot to answer for in 2016.",

One of the reasons that M&amp;S\u2019s clothing range can look so dowdy is that there is so much retail space to fill: it can\u2019t possibly get everything right.</p> <p>In contrast to M&amp;S\u2019s clothing, its food business has a clear upmarket position. This Christmas, families will flock to M&amp;S for their festive fare. With Tesco, Asda, Sainsbury\u2019s, Morrisons and Waitrose dramatically cutting back investment, M&amp;S has a glorious opportunity to expand.</p> <p>Having said all this, M&amp;S should not start treating its clothing arm as a secondary consideration within the group. Cutting the amount of the space dedicated to clothing gives the company an opportunity to rethink its approach to fashion. Rowe must surely follow the success of the food business and make M&amp;S clothing more aspirational.</p> <h2>A year of revolt</h2> <p>There is more in common between Sir Philip Green, Mike Ashley and Donald Trump than their body shapes and wealth. Trump\u2019s victory has sparked dismay \u2013 not just at the election of a man recorded making sexist remarks but at how, when coupled with Brexit, it suggests the west has turned its back on trade.</p> <p>The scandals involving BHS and Sports Direct highlight why people may have come to question the benefits of tariff-fee imports and exports.</p> <p>While business leaders like Green and Ashley have filled their boots and expanded empires, the workers who have driven their stores\u2019 success have not shared their wealth.</p> <p>Green and Ashley are billionaires, but 11,000 BHS workers have lost their jobs and part of their pensions, while Sports Direct staff are stuck on zero-hours contracts.</p> <p>Those who have taken advantage of the freedoms offered by globalisation and the free markets have a lot to answer for in 2016.</p>",

      "bodyText": "It feels like a long time since economy-watchers were gripped by the saga about how long Mark Carney would stay at the Bank of England. In fact it was only two weeks ago that the governor agreed to extend his term by a year to 2019 after an apparent attempt by various Conservatives to drive him out as soon as possible. His critics were emboldened by Theresa May\u2019s criticism of recent monetary policy in her conference speech, but in the end May needed Carney \u2013 and his decision came across as if he\u2019d granted the prime minister another year of his time. When he took the job in 2013, Carney said he would only serve five years of the usual eight-year term, but \u2013 after enduring barbs from William Hague, Michael Gove and other Tories \u2013 leaving as planned in 2018 could have looked like flouncing out. Andrew Tyrie, the indefatigable chairman of the Treasury committee, wants to know more and will get his chance on Tuesday when Carney and other BoE rate-setters appear before MPs. The session will also pit the governor once more against his most personal critic, the anachronistic Tory backbencher Jacob Rees-Mogg, who was bizarrely touted as a potential replacement for Carney. The governor could barely hide his irritation at Rees-Mogg during previous committee sessions, so Tuesday should be fun. May\u2019s governance moment The word on the corporate governance grapevine is that this could be the week the government publishes its proposals for holding companies to account. In her pitch for the Tory leadership, Theresa May said she would put worker and consumer representatives on boards and impose binding votes on bosses\u2019 pay. May repeated the pledge in her conference speech last month, setting herself up as the champion of working people left behind by globalisation. But lobbyists have been working away at the government, suggesting weaker alternatives to employees on boards such as workers\u2019 councils, or giving a director the job of sounding out the workforce. If that happens, the City and the government could have a hard time since Donald Trump\u2019s victory reinforced the idea that disenfranchised workers are in revolt. Unions and other supporters of reform could reasonably argue May has been got at by big business just when she should be sticking to her promises. The government has said only that the proposals will come before Christmas, so we may have to wait a bit longer: but the speculation shows how exercised investors are about the matter. Troubled vintage at Majestic? When Rowan Gormley arrived at Majestic Wine in April 2015 he was greeted as a saviour after years of recurring disappointments at Britain\u2019s biggest independent wine merchant. Majestic, which reports half-year results on Thursday, brought Gormley in along with his Naked Wines business and his ideas made sense. He scrapped the offputting six-bottle minimum purchase and set about livening up shops and products and giving staff more time to talk to customers. But things have got gloomier this year. The shares lost a quarter of their value in one day in September when Gormley unveiled a profit warning caused by a failed US marketing campaign and weak sales to business customers. Perhaps more worrying for Majestic in the long run is the big fall in the pound since the vote for Brexit. English wines may be increasingly popular, but almost all Majestic\u2019s stock comes from France, Australia and other countries whose goods have become more expensive. Gormley has said cost increases may need to be passed on to customers but supermarkets locked in a price war may choose to absorb some of the hit, limiting his scope to protect profits. Gormley is doing the right things but, with the crucial Christmas period coming up, what assurances can he give about sterling\u2019s fall?",

      "bodyText": "All right: the egregious Donald Trump\u2019s victory is, in his words, \u201cBrexit plus, plus, plus\u201d, and it is far more significantly ominous for the rest of the world than Brexit. But what Trump\u2019s triumph also does is to strengthen the case for re-examining the Brexit decision. Europe is now faced with huge geopolitical concerns. It should be pulling together, and resisting the centrifugal forces which the result of the British referendum can only aggravate. Put bluntly, the rest of the European Union needs Britain, and, as it faces up to the implications of Trump\u2019s love affair with Putin and manifest isolationist tendencies, the last thing either we or the other 27 need is for Brexit to dominate the next few years. I still meet people who are surprised to learn that, on referendum day, Nigel Farage stated that, if the result were to be 52%-48% in favour of Remain, then it should be followed by another referendum. The very idea that \u201cthe British people have spoken\u201d, and that therefore the vote is irrevocable, does not quite stand the test of history. The British people spoke in 1975, but the likes of Nigel Farage did not like what they said, so in due course we saw the rise of Ukip and the emergence of Farage, conveniently financed personally by a salary from the European parliament \u2013 a salary which, I understand, he continues to draw. Talk about having it both ways. Time after time, people change their minds in a parliamentary democracy \u2013 there was a time in Italy in the 1950s and 1960s when they seemed to have elections every year. The hysteria fomented by the Brexit press, with attacks on the legitimacy of judges, is reminiscent of Germany in the 1930s and the rise of Hitler. We have a prime minister who seems to be obsessed by what the Daily Mail advises; younger readers may care to study the record of that newspaper with regard to fascism in the 1930s. It is worth repeating that only 37% of the adult population voted for Brexit and many of them were misled by a nasty propaganda campaign from the Leavers, which crossed the boundary from selective use of the facts to outright lies. It is therefore good to see that Professor Bob Watt, an expert in electoral law at the University of Buckingham, has complained to the director of public prosecutions that the lies propagated by the Vote Leave and Leave.EU campaigns \u2013 the EU costing \u00a3350m a week which could go to the NHS, \u201cTurkey joining the EU\u201d, etc \u2013 contravened electoral law. There is already a bottomless pit of articles and emails on the question of the timing of invoking article 50 of the Lisbon treaty \u2013 to begin the process, not of negotiation, but of withdrawal from the EU. We now await the judgment of the supreme court early next year on the high court\u2019s ruling that parliament should be involved. I thought it was pretty shocking in the first place that our prime minister should have tried to bypass the sovereignty of parliament, and she continued to shock when refusing to criticise the vicious,1930s-style attacks on the judges \u2013 merely saying that she believed in a free press. Don\u2019t we all \u2013 but, surely, a free and responsible one. As Private Eye reminds us, the Mail\u2019s picture of the three high court judges used a headline \u2013 \u201cEnemies of the people\u201d \u2013 that echoed the vile slogans of Robespierre, Lenin, Chairman Mao and the Nazi propagandist Julius Streicher. It is not as if, according to recent reports, she needs to worry. We are told that, although the vast majority of MPs are against Brexit, most of them are intending to \u201crespect\u201d the result of the referendum. This country is heading for a train crash. As one political historian said last week: \u201cI don\u2019t think there is any previous example in British history where policymakers were so determined to vote against their true beliefs.\u201d The problem for those of us who remain unrepentant Remainers is that the economic consequences of 23 June constitute a \u201cslow burner\u201d. This is the biggest British economic crisis of my long experience, and I have little doubt that when the full extent of the damage to investment becomes apparent, it will become increasingly obvious that the vast majority of the people will regret their decision. As to the crucial point of whether the referendum result can legally be reversed, in a paper presented last week to the European parliament, Andrew Duff \u2013 a great expert on all matters European \u2013 wrote: \u201cContrary to the claims made in the English high court, article 50 is indeed revocable. Article 50(2) involves a notification of an intention to withdraw from the union. Intentions can change, especially after a general election and the installation of a new government.\u201d Meanwhile, our new chancellor faces the daunting prospect when preparing his much-hyped autumn statement (due 23 November) of dire economic forecasts from the Institute of Fiscal Studies \u2013 and doubtless, in due course, from the Office for Budget Responsibility. These will reflect the expected impact on the nation\u2019s finances of the exodus of financial and other institutions that want to ensure their place in the single market. They have to take serious long-term decisions, and are not impressed by the chaotic non-strategy of the Brexiters.",

On Sunday Labor released a letter the deputy chairman of Australian parliament\u2019s joint standing committee on treaties (Jscot), Michael Danby, wrote to the chairman, Stuart Robert, on Thursday proposing the committee not report on the TPP unless Congress planned to consider it. \u201cIt now appears the TPP is very unlikely to be ratified by the US,\u201d Danby wrote. \u201cAs you know, if the United States does not ratify the TPP there is no TPP and nothing for Jscot to formally consider.\u201d Danby argued it was \u201cvery unlikely\u201d the Republican-controlled Congress would ratify the TPP because Trump had threatened to withdraw from it. He asked for Jscot to delay its report on the TPP \u201cuntil it becomes clearer whether the TPP will even be considered by the US Congress\u201d before Trump\u2019s inauguration. On Sunday the Obama administration conceded the TPP would not pass after Republican congressional leaders said they would not consider voting on the trade deal in the \u201clame duck\u201d session before Trump is sworn in on 20 January. A spokeswoman for the shadow trade minister, Jason Clare, said the news was \u201ceven more\u201d reason to postpone the committee report. \u201cThere is no TPP unless the US Congress votes for it and it\u2019s now clear that\u2019s not going to happen,\u201d she said. \u201cSo there is no point in the Australian government pushing on trying to ratify something that will never come into existence.\u201d The TPP is a proposed free-trade agreement to cover 12 economies that account for 40% of the world\u2019s gross domestic product including the US, Japan, South Korea and Australia. It promised to open services markets and remove barriers to investment. Labor has concerns about the TPP, including its investor state dispute resolution clause and that it removes labour market testing for six countries. The current requirement forces companies to check whether Australians want skilled jobs before sourcing people from overseas. Labor supports the TPP in principle, which puts it at odds with Australian unions who oppose it outright, but has said it will reserve its final position until it has seen the enabling legislation for ratification. Delay of the Jscot process to reflect the fact the TPP will not proceed may therefore save an internal debate within the opposition about the trade deal, although Clare\u2019s spokeswoman denied that was the reason for Labor\u2019s call. On Sunday the trade and investment minister, Steven Ciobo, said the Obama administration is \u201clooking to secure the passage of the TPP\u201d in the lame duck session but conceded it was \u201cless likely than likely\u201d. \u201cNonetheless, Australia stands by our advocacy ... that this is a good deal for trade, it\u2019s a good deal for bringing down lower red tape and lower levels of compliance when it comes to trade and it is ultimately a benefit to all 12 member states,\u201d he said. Asked if the other 11 states could go it alone without the US, Ciobo said it was theoretically possible they could strike a new trade deal but \u201cofficially the TPP would not get up\u201d and it \u201csubstantially\u201d changed the case on the merits of signing up. He said all Australia\u2019s eggs were not in one basket, as it was pursuing a regional comprehensive economic partnership, trade in services agreement and potential bilateral agreements, including with the European Union and the UK.",

      "bodyText": "White House officials conceded on Friday that the president\u2019s hard-fought-for Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) trade deal would not pass Congress, as lawmakers there prepared for the anti-global trade policies of President-elect Donald Trump. Earlier this week, congressional leaders in both parties said they would not bring the trade deal forward during a lame-duck session of Congress, before the formal transition of power on 20 January. The Democratic senator Chuck Schumer, who will be minority leader in the next Congress, told union leaders the trade deal would not pass. Senator Mitch McConnell, the chamber\u2019s Republican majority leader, told reporters \u201cno\u201d when asked if Congress would consider the TPP. The deal has supporters in both parties but became a campaign symbol for lost manufacturing jobs, especially in the rust belt states. The TPP would have included the US and 11 countries in Asia, South America and the south Pacific, and was designed in large part to curb the growing economic influence of China. But it was attacked almost daily by Trump, who called it \u201ca continuing rape of our country\u201d and argued that as a symbol of globalized manufacturing in general, it had sent jobs from the US to other countries and damaged the American economy. Trump has similarly argued that the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta) \u2013 negotiated by George HW Bush, signed by both Republican and Democratic presidents and passed through a Republican Congress \u2013 destroyed jobs in the US. Trump\u2019s opponent, Hillary Clinton, argued against the TPP in its current form, although she supported it while secretary of state for the Obama White House. During the Democratic primary she was pushed by Bernie Sanders, a self-identified democratic socialist senator from Vermont, to give up her support. On Monday, Barack Obama is scheduled to travel to Greece, Germany and Peru, his final major trip abroad in office. At an economic summit in Peru, Obama will meet its president, Australian prime minister Malcolm Turnbull and Chinese president Xi Jinping. Australia and Peru were both slated to join the TPP deal. On Friday, one of Obama\u2019s top advisers could not imagine a way to ensure its passage in the next two months. \u201cWe\u2019re clear-eyed about the current situation,\u201d Ben Rhodes told the Associated Press. \u201cBut we believe what we believe about the value of trade and the importance of the Asia-Pacific region to the United States. \u201cAnd I think, given its size and importance, it\u2019s going to have to continue to be a focus for the next president and Congress going forward no matter what.\u201d Also on Friday, Wally Adeyemo, a deputy national security adviser for international economic affairs, told the Wall Street Journal: \u201cIn terms of the TPP agreement itself, Leader McConnell has spoken to that, and it\u2019s something that he\u2019s going to work with the president-elect to figure out where they go in terms of trade agreements in the future.\u201d Despite popular opposition from voters, few details of the TPP were discussed on the campaign trail. It would have phased out thousands of tariffs other countries place on US imports, making products easier to sell abroad, for instance for ranchers selling beef to customers in Japan and Australia. It also would have set up open internet and copyright protections across the 12 nations, benefitting the entertainment industry and undercutting online piracy in China. The deal also included provisions against wildlife trafficking and child labor, holding countries such as Vietnam and Malaysia to higher standards. Opponents of the deal, including many unions, argued it did not protect against countries that manipulate their currency and foreign companies suing, in special tribunals, for exemptions to various US rules.",

      "bodyText": "Traditional owners fighting to stop Australia\u2019s largest proposed coalmine are at the centre of a new University of Queensland project exploring worldwide Indigenous rights movements in the era of climate upheaval. Leaders from the Wangan and Jagalingou traditional owners council, who are enmeshed in a legal and lobbying effort to head off Adani\u2019s Carmichael mine, will collaborate with academics and human rights lawyers for the first \u201cflagship\u201d project chosen by UQ\u2019s Global Change Institute. The prominent Canadian activist and journalist Naomi Klein said the W&amp;J traditional owners were \u201cat the forefront of fossil fuel resistance and protecting their land, water and culture\u201d. UQ said the project would \u201cexplore the international Indigenous movement that is reimagining human rights and social and economic development in the global era of scarce water resources, climate change and energy transition\u201d. The project \u2013 We Are The People From That Land: Centring Indigenous Peoples\u2019 Rights in the Transition to a Sustainable, Low-Carbon Future \u2013 will involve work by three UQ \u201cinvestigators\u201d across different disciplines. The academics will work with W&amp;J leaders including Murrawah Johnson, who Klein said was \u201ca powerful spokesperson and organiser who is on the front line of holding back one of the largest proposed coal mines in the world\u201d. \u201cWith her elders and council, she is shining a light on the urgent need for a justice-based transition in the face of the climate crisis,\u201d Klein said. The W&amp;J at large are divided over the question of allowing Adani to exploit their Galilee basin homelands for the open-cut Carmichael coalmine. Questions about discrete payments by Adani to some W&amp;J representatives who support the mine were this year a flashpoint in an ongoing dispute over who legitimately speaks for traditional owners. The UQ project researchers are the economist John Quiggin, the social science researcher Kristen Lyons, who has worked in development and environmental sociology, and the political scientist Morgan Briggs. UQ said the GCI \u201cflagship projects cut across disciplinary and thematic boundaries, demanding new ways of thinking\u201d. Human rights lawyer Benedict Coyne, who has acted in some of the W&amp;J challenges around the mining proposal, will provide legal analysis. Johnson said the project was \u201ca great opportunity for the Wangan and Jagalingou people to chart a new path to justice and sustainability, and to social and economic opportunities in the transition to a low-carbon world\u201d. \u201cThe project will help shape a shared understanding of how to sustain our lands and waters and enrich our culture, and build our futures on this,\u201d she said. Adrian Burragubba, the senior W&amp;J traditional owner who is spearheading legal challenges around the mining proposal, said: \u201cWe want to share our knowledge and give the world an appreciation of the significance of our culture and the way in which the protection of lands and waters is a matter of Indigenous law and environmental sustainability\u201d. Coyne said the project would \u201cgreatly enhance our understanding of the intersection of the important issues at play in contemporary Australia and internationally regarding climate change, natural resource conservation and human rights \u2013 particularly the rights of Indigenous peoples\u201d. The project will be funded to the value of up to $120,000 over two years. It is backed by a longtime GCI supporter, the multimillionaire Wotif founder turned philanthropist Graeme Wood, who is also a financial backer of Guardian Australia. Wood said W&amp;J council leaders were \u201cforging new ground in our understanding of Indigenous rights in Australia in the transition to a low carbon and just future\u201d. \u2022 This story was amended on 14 November 2016 to clarify that Benedict Coyne is not acting in his capacity as president of Australian Lawyers for Human Rights.",
