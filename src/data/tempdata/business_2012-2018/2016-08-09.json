      "bodyText": "China is a big spender in the UK, where it has invested more than in Germany, France and Italy combined in recent years. Investors have sunk around $38bn (\u00a329bn) into everything from prime London real estate to banks and football clubs according to figures from the American Enterprise Institute and the Heritage Foundation. Alongside the low-key property deals, Chinese companies have also struck deals to buy a string of household names over the past few years. Shanghai-based Bright Foods owns 60% of Weetabix after it paid \u00a3720m to get its teeth into the cereal company in May 2012, while Hony Capital paid \u00a3900m for restaurant chain Pizza Express in July 2014. Some of the UK\u2019s retail powerhouses are also under Chinese ownership, including the famous Hamleys toy shop on Regent Street, sold to footwear firm C.banner international for \u00a3100m in October last year. The House of Fraser department store chain is Chinese-owned, after Nanjing Cenbest paid \u00a3480m for an 89% stake in September 2014. The glamour of English football has also proved an attractive prospect for Chinese fans of the Premier League with money to spend. Dr Tony Xia bought Aston Villa for an undisclosed sum thought to be around \u00a352m in June, saying he wanted to restore the relegated club to its former glory and make it the \u201cbest known football club in the world\u201d. Villa\u2019s near neighbours West Bromwich Albion are on the verge of being sold to an investment group led by Chinese entrepreneur Guochuan Lai, while fellow Midlands club Wolverhampton Wanderers was bought by investment group Fosun International for around \u00a345m last month. Chinese investors\u2019 sporting ambitions also extend to golf, with the Wentworth club sold to Reignwood for \u00a3135m in September 2014, while Dalian Wanda Group paid \u00a3320m for 92% of Sunseeker Yachts in June 2013. Sovereign wealth fund China Investment Corporation is also a big investor in the UK. Its holdings include a \u00a3450m 10% stake in Heathrow Holdings, the firm behind the UK\u2019s hub airport, bought in November 2012.",

      "bodyText": "The challenge facing UK trade negotiators following the EU referendum has been spelled out by a report from one of the country\u2019s leading thinktanks, showing that membership of the European single market is worth an additional 4% of GDP to the economy. The Institute for Fiscal Studies said that Britain could enjoy the same sort of access to the world\u2019s biggest market on the same World Trade Organisation terms as other non-EU member states such as the US, China or India. But it said membership of the single market provided additional benefits that might be lost depending on the deal struck by ministers in Theresa May\u2019s government. Ian Mitchell, research associate at the IFS and an author of the report, said: \u201cFrom an economic point of view we still face some very big choices indeed in terms of our future relationship with the EU. There is all the difference in the world between \u2018access to\u2019 and \u2018membership of\u2019 the single market. \u201cMembership is likely to offer significant economic benefits particularly for trade in services. But outside the EU, single market membership also comes at the cost of accepting future regulations designed in the EU without UK input. This may be seriously problematic for some parts of the financial services sector. Choices in these domains will most likely be far more important than any deal on budget contributions.\u201d The IFS said single market membership meant elimination of trade barriers not possible under existing trade deals. These included so-called \u201cnon-tariff\u201d barriers such as licensing or regulations that make it harder to export goods and services. The thinktank added that service sector exports were becoming especially important to the UK, accounting for 44% of total exports in 2015, up from 31% in 1999. Two-fifths of service sector exports go to the UK, whereas the Bric countries (Brazil, Russia, India and China) account for less than 5% together. \u201cSingle market membership is particularly important for financial services\u201d, the IFS said. \u201c\u2018Passporting rights\u2019 mean that UK-based financial firms can service EU businesses and customers directly. To maintain these rights would likely require membership of the European Economic Area. \u201cBut that would come at the potentially considerable cost of submitting to future regulations designed in the EU without input from the UK. The UK may have to make some very difficult choices between the benefits from passporting and the costs of submitting to external imposed regulation.\u201d The UK\u2019s newly created department of International Trade headed by Liam Fox is keen to negotiate free trade deals with countries outside the EU. The IFS said that new agreements would mitigate the economic cost of giving up single market membership.",

      "bodyText": "The Bank of England\u2019s post-Brexit economic recovery plan got off to a stumbling start when it was unable to buy as many government bonds as it needed from major City investors. Threadneedle Street will spell out on Wednesday how it plans to get reluctant investors to part with government bonds \u2013 also known as gilts \u2013 in order to provide additional stimulus to the economy under its new \u00a360bn quantitative easing (QE) programme. The Bank enacts its electronic money-printing exercise \u2013 which was launched in March 2009 and was one element of a stimulus package to kickstart the economy announced last Thursday \u2013 by buying gilts. One of the other key measures \u2013 a quarter-point cut in interest rates to 0.25% \u2013 has also run into problems, with some high street banks unwilling to pass on fully cheaper borrowing costs to their customers. The Bank offered on Tuesday to buy back \u00a31.17bn of long-dated gilts \u2013 those with a maturity of 15 years or more \u2013 but received offers of only \u00a31.11bn, leaving it with a shortfall of \u00a352m. It is the first time since the Bank started buying back bonds that it has failed to attract enough sellers. Jason Simpson, a UK rate strategist at French bank Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale, told Reuters: \u201cIt is a little surprising that this comes on the first week ... it is quite early in the whole process, which will be a worry for the Bank of England.\u201d The unexpectedly low uptake of the buyback offer sparked a sharp reaction in the market, with yields on long-dated government bonds falling to record lows. Yields fall when the prices of bonds rise and push down the rate at which the government pays to borrow from major City investors. Yields on 20-year gilts slumped to 1.2%, while those on 30-year bonds fell to 1.36%, in the anticipation that the Bank will hike the price it is prepared to pay investors to buy back the gilts. Daniela Russell, a bond strategist at Legal &amp; General Investment Management, said: \u201cIt is going to be interesting to see how the Bank of England responds.\u201d While Threadneedle Street could increase the price, it could also decide to increase the amount of gilts it attempts to buy at next week\u2019s buying window. The fact the buyback has begun during the traditionally quiet month of August may explain the low result, bond experts said, adding that it was too early to conclude that pension funds \u2013 the traditional buyers of such long-dated gilts \u2013 were reluctant to sell. Stuart Edwards, a global bond fund manager at Invesco Perpetual, said he was not overly concerned by the shortfall. He pointed out that a buyback of shorter-dated bonds the previous day had been \u201cwell covered\u201d \u2013 the Bank received offers of more than three times the amount it wanted to buy. There are two ideas behind the Bank buying the bonds: to stimulate economic demand by encouraging the banks and financial institutions selling the gilts to use the proceeds to boost lending to households and businesses or invest in other assets; and to force down the cost of borrowing for the government by increasing demand for bonds, thus increasing their price. The latest QE plan is part of a four-pronged strategy to tackle an expected slowdown in the economy caused by the vote to leave the EU. Along with the cut to interest rates, the Bank is also creating another \u00a310bn in electronic cash to buy corporate bonds. It is also trying to encourage banks to pass on the interest rate cut by offering as much as \u00a3100bn of new funding to banks. Under this \u201cterm funding scheme\u201d, the Bank will create new money to provide loans to banks at interest rates close to the base rate of 0.25%. The Bank has admitted that rates could fall to as low as 0.1% \u2013 but not zero or negative \u2013 if the economy falters. There could also be further QE. The Bank launched QE, announcing \u00a375bn of newly created money to buy bonds, when it also cut interest rates to a then record low of 0.5% in 2009. Over the following three years it expanded QE five times, hitting \u00a3375bn in July 2012 when the UK faced a prolonged double-dip recession.",

    "webTitle": "UK economy shrinks in July as activity falls after Brexit vote, says Niesr", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "One of Britain\u2019s leading economic thinktanks has said the UK economy shrank last month as the impact of the Brexit vote led to a pronounced weakening in activity. The National Institute of Economic and Social Research estimated that gross domestic product contracted by 0.2% in July. Niesr published the findings after official government figures showed that the UK trade deficit widened and factory production eased back in the weeks immediately before and after the EU referendum on 23 June. James Warren, a research fellow at Niesr, said: \u201cWe estimate that in the three months to July, the UK economy grew by 0.3%, a marked economic slowdown. The month-on-month profile suggests that the third quarter has got off to a weak start, with output declining in July. Our estimates suggest that there is around an evens chance of a technical recession by the end of 2017.\u201d The thinktank came to a gloomy conclusion after data from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) showed that a spurt in manufacturing came to an end in June, with output dropping by 0.3%. Meanwhile, UK exports failed to match imports, with the trade deficit rising by \u00a30.9bn to \u00a35.1bn. The poor trade and manufacturing figures led to a fall in the pound on the foreign exchanges. At one stage, sterling dipped below $1.30 and threatened to reach a post-Brexit vote low, before later rallying. However the ONS said there was little evidence of industry adopting a cautious approach because of uncertainty caused by the closely fought referendum campaign. The organisation\u2019s chief economist, Joe Grice, said: \u201cAs we previously highlighted in our preliminary estimate of GDP, production and the wider economy grew strongly in April, and then remained at roughly the same level throughout May and June. \u201cAny uncertainties in the run-up to the referendum seem to have had little impact on production, with very few respondents to our surveys reporting it as an issue.\u201d The ONS said total production, which includes mining, output from the North Sea, energy supply and manufacturing, increased by 0.1% from May to June. Manufacturing, the biggest component of production, fell by 0.3%. During the three months to June \u2013 which is considered a better guide to the trend than one month\u2019s figures \u2013 production was up by 2.1% on the previous quarter, while manufacturing rose by 1.8%. Despite the strong quarterly increases, manufacturing and overall production remain well below the peak reached in early 2008, when the UK was on the cusp of a recession. A steady decline in North Sea oil and gas output means that production is 7.5% below the early 2008 level, while manufacturing is 4.5% lower. The struggles of manufacturing during and after the recession of 2008-09 have made it harder for Britain to close its trade gap with the rest of the world. According to the ONS, there was an increase of \u00a30.9bn to \u00a312.4bn in the UK\u2019s deficit in goods in June, offset by the continued strong performance of the service sector, which ran a surplus of \u00a37.3bn. Between the first and second quarters of 2016, the UK\u2019s deficit in goods and services combined widened by \u00a30.4bn to \u00a312.5bn. Lee Hopley, the chief economist at manufacturers\u2019 association EEF, said: \u201cThe latest data suggests manufacturing posted some significant gains in the second quarter. Growth was supported by record levels of exports of cars to the EU and aircraft to non-EU markets. \u201cClearly, indicators of sentiment post referendum suggest that we\u2019ve hit the high point for manufacturing this year. Amid the wavering levels of confidence, however, we should take away some positive news, firstly that manufacturing entered this period of uncertainty from a relatively strong stance, and the weaker exchange rate could yet bring benefits on the export side. \u201cStill, we\u2019ll need a concerted effort from government to maintain investment across the sector and ensure growth like that seen in the second quarter gets back on track.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Brexit or no Brexit, it has been clear for months that the only way for the pound was down. When a country is running a balance of payments deficit unsurpassed in peacetime history, it is hard to make a compelling case for its currency going up. In truth, all the referendum vote on 23 June has done is to bring forward the fall in sterling and squeeze it into a shorter period. Following the latest set of poor trade figures, the pound looked as if it might test its post-referendum low against the dollar, but it later recovered to close above the $1.30 level. The respite is likely to be shortlived. Even though political concerns about the UK have faded since the formation of Theresa May\u2019s government, there are other reasons why the pound will hit $1.20 before it hits $1.40. First, the Bank of England has made it clear that it is thinking about further easing of policy in the coming months. Threadneedle Street is adopting a policy of benign neglect towards the currency, seeing a cheaper pound as a mechanism for boosting growth through higher exports. Second, strong jobs growth in the US has put a rise in interest rates back on the agenda for the Federal Reserve. The exchange rates for a pair of currencies are affected by relative moves in interest rates, and investors can see American borrowing costs going up at the same time as UK borrowing costs are coming down. Is this cause for concern? Well, obviously it is not marvellous news for those planning a holiday in Florida or California this year. But for it to be a sterling crisis investors would have to be dumping UK government gilts in large quantities, and that\u2019s not happening.

      "body": "<p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/eu-referendum\">Brexit</a> or no Brexit, it has been clear for months that the only way for the pound was down. When a country is running a balance of payments deficit unsurpassed in peacetime history, it is hard to make a compelling case for its currency going up.</p> <p>In truth, all the referendum vote on 23 June has done is to bring forward the fall in sterling and squeeze it into a shorter period. Following the latest set of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/aug/09/uk-trade-deficit-widens-brexit-economy-eu-referendum\">poor trade figures</a>, the pound looked as if it might test its post-referendum low against the dollar, but it later recovered to close above the $1.30 level.</p> <p>The respite is likely to be shortlived. Even though political concerns about the UK have faded since the formation of Theresa May\u2019s government, there are other reasons why the pound will hit $1.20 before it hits $1.40.</p> <p>First, the Bank of England has made it clear that it is thinking about further easing of policy in the coming months. Threadneedle Street is adopting a policy of benign neglect towards the currency, seeing a cheaper pound as a mechanism for boosting growth through higher exports.</p> <p>Second, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/usemployment\">strong jobs growth in the US</a> has put a rise in interest rates back on the agenda for the Federal Reserve. The exchange rates for a pair of currencies are affected by relative moves in interest rates, and investors can see American borrowing costs going up at the same time as UK borrowing costs are coming down.</p> <p>Is this cause for concern? Well, obviously it is not marvellous news for those planning a holiday in Florida or California this year. But for it to be a sterling crisis investors would have to be dumping UK government gilts in large quantities, and that\u2019s not happening. A weaker pound will help to close the trade gap and gilts are so attractive that the Bank is having trouble getting investors to part with them under its new quantitative easing programme. The best of both worlds, in fact.</p>",

      "bodyText": "With the prospect of low interest rates for longer and further central bank stimulus measures, along with a little more stability in the oil market ahead of a forthcoming Opec meeting, stock markets moved higher once more. Banks were also in demand as the post-Brexit blues wore off and a UK competition inquiry was less arduous for the sector than it had feared. Even signs of a slowdown in the UK economy from the latest NIESR report did not dampen the enthusiasm. Tony Cross, market analyst at Trustnet Direct, said: The FTSE-100 continues to forge its way higher as an upbeat start to the session on Wall Street gives those traders who are still at their desks something else to cheer. The fact that oil prices have staged something of a turn around is certainly helping bolster sentiment, although it\u2019s probably worth adding that if we see this rally for crude being sustained then it starts to up the chances of a September rate hike by the Fed \u2013 and that has the potential to take the shine off gains on a global basis. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished up 42.17 points or 0.62% at 6851.30 Germany\u2019s Dax rose 2.5% to 10,692.90, its highest level this year France\u2019s Cac closed 1.19% higher at 4468.07 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB edged up 0.31% to 16,796.14 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended 1.2% better at 8665.4 In Greece, the Athens market added 0.36% to 562.4 On Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 16 points or 0.09%, well off its earlier highs. Meanwhile the pound continued to slip amid talk of further easing by the Bank of England, down 0.3% at $1.2999 and 0.4% lower at \u20ac1.1707. On that note, it\u2019s time to close for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. Stock markets are continuing to move higher, with the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq in the US at new intra-day highs. In Europe, Germany\u2019s Dax is up 2.3% while the FTSE 100 is 46 points or 0.69% better. Joshua Mahony, market analyst at IG, said: The FTSE bulls have come back out to play today, with the main benchmark pushing into yet another 13-month high. At a time when many would expect the UK to be in the midst of sombre post-referendum introspection, UK markets are instead focusing on the here and now of lower for longer rates and the expectation of years of QE. Amid a wave of tourists taking advantage of a weak sterling, a similarly seismic shift is also likely from an investment point of view, with foreign investors likely to sweep up discounted UK assets. More interest rate cuts and further stimulus measures are likely as the UK economy slows, according to former member of the Bank of England\u2019s monetary policy committee David Blanchflower. Writing in the Guardian he says the Bank did the right thing by reducing rates last week, but adding that the uncertainty following the Brexit vote is likely to continue for years: The good news is you should be able to make money by buying shares and gold. The bad news is that this will widen inequality further, as it does nothing to help the poor, the young and ordinary strugglers who don\u2019t have assets. The full article is here: The Bank of England has suffered a setback in the bond markets in its first attempt to buy long-dated debt under its new QE programme. Reuters reports: The Bank of England failed to get enough offers for its planned purchase of \u00a31.17bn of government bonds with maturities longer than 15 years, sending gilt yields to new record lows across a range of maturities. The BoE said it received offers worth \u00a31.118bn, resulting in an uncovered reverse auction in its first attempt to buy long-dated debt since it restarted its quantitative easing asset purchase programme after nearly four years. The central bank said it would announce its response to the shortfall on Wednesday at 0800 GMT. Twenty-year gilt yields hit a record low of 1.212 percent and were last down 5 basis points at 1.22 percent. Thirty-year yields hit a record low of 1.374 percent, and were last down 4.9 basis points at 1.385 percent. Yields on five- and 10-year gilts also hit all-time lows. The Bank of England was not immediately available for further comment. The UK economy slowed down by more than expected in July in the wake of the Brexit vote, according to the latest monthly GDP estimates from the National Institute of Economic and Social Research, and could foreshadow a recession by the end of 2017. NIESR said output grew by 0.3% in the three months ending in July, following growth of 0.6% in the three months to June and expectations of a figure of 0.4%. The thinktank said the estimates suggested that monthly output declined by 0.2% in July, although it warned that monthly data were volatile. But it added that the estimate was in line with its latest quarterly forecast, which predicted a contraction of 0.2% in the third quarter. James Warren, research fellow at NIESR said: We estimate that in the three months to July the UK economy grew by 0.3 per cent, a marked economic slowdown. The month on month profile suggests that the third quarter has got off to a weak start, with output declining in July. Our estimates suggest that there is around an evens chance of a technical recession by the end of 2017. US markets are following the trend elsewhere in early trading, heading higher as oil prices remain steady at around $45 a barrel. The Dow Jones Industrial Index is currently up 39 points or 0.2% while the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq both opened marginally ahead. Further signs of the state of the UK economy will come shortly (3pm BST) as independent thinktank NIESR issues its latest GDP estimates. After growth of 0.6% in the three months to June, analysts expect NIESR\u2019s latest estimate for the three months to June to show a decline to around 0.4%. Ana Thaker, market economist at financial group PhillipCapital UK, said: Today\u2019s UK NIESR GDP figures promise to be crucial and will provide a reliable gauge of growth in the UK for July. The first snapshot of post-Brexit Britain from NIESR will no doubt move markets following the momentous decision to cut rates last week. If figures are weak the Bank of England will likely feel vindicated and will add assurance to the markets that their decision was well timed rather than hasty. However, weaker figures could see sterling fall further below the crucial $1.30 level as economic growth fears are confirmed; weak figures combined with the beginning of looser monetary policy could see sterling extend its losing streak and settle at new lows as markets await the effectiveness of new policy measures. Sterling has fallen 1.9% this month alone and underperforms compared to major peers, whilst this was previously viewed as a temporal dip we could see this become the long term trend of the currency. Another chart showing how the pound has weakened to one-month lows today, amid talk of more stimulus measures from the Bank of England: The big problems with America\u2019s weak productivity is that it could drive up the cost of employing people (as wages are currently going up). So, if a firm has skimped on new machinery and used more workers instead, it could easily start laying them off. Bloomberg has a good explanation: Productivity compared with a year earlier fell for the first time since 2013 as lackluster global markets prompted companies to scale back capital investment plans. In the face of deteriorating corporate profits and an absence of faster economic growth, the risk is that businesses may begin to ratchet back the hiring they\u2019ve relied on to meet demand. \u201cFirms have been substituting labor for capital,\u201d Richard Moody, chief economist at Regions Financial Corp. in Birmingham, Alabama, said before the report. \u201cThe advantage for firms is that if growth does fall off, it\u2019s a lot easier to rid yourself of excess labor than it is excess capital.\u201d Worrying news from America.... US productivity shrank by 0.5% in the second quarter of the year, following a 0.6% decline in the first three months. Economists has expected productivity to snap back in Q2, and forecasts a rise of 0.5%. That will fuel concerns about the underlying health of the US economy, as productivity is measured by the output per hour of work. So, while more Americans are getting jobs - and pay rises - it doesn\u2019t seem to be translating into higher productivity. Ian McCafferty\u2019s hint that more Bank of England stimulus could be needed has hit the pound today, says FXTM chief market strategist Hussein Sayed. Sterling slipped below $1.30 for the first time since July 12 following comments from BoE\u2019s Ian McCafferty that more easing is likely to be required if economic conditions deteriorated. Today marks the fifth consecutive day of declines on pound and the longest losing streak since the Brexit vote... The news that Britain\u2019s manufacturing output shrank by 0.3% in June hasn\u2019t helped the mood towards the pound either. But we should remember that there are two sides to a currency pair, and the dollar is also benefitting from last Friday\u2019s strong US jobs report. Despite the latest grim trade data, Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 index has hit a new 14-month high today. The blue-chip index has gained 20 points this morning to 6831, which is its highest level since June 2015 [before fears over China\u2019s economy sparked a rout] That\u2019s partly due to the weakening pound, which boosts the value of international firms who earn money overseas, and gives foreign predators more firepower. David Miller, investment director at Quilter Cheviot, explains: Despite the lurid headlines, the curious thing, as Sherlock Holmes might have observed, is that the dog isn\u2019t barking. UK financial markets are delivering positive returns.... Since the unexpected referendum result sterling has fallen, making corporate UK more competitive on a global basis, short term interest rates have been reduced, but more importantly long term borrowing costs are also significantly lower and takeover activity is picking up because UK assets are now 10% cheaper than they were a month or so ago. The DAX police are out in force, pointing out that Germany\u2019s benchmark stock index is an odd beast - and actually includes dividends paid to shareholders: Good news for German investors. Over in Frankfurt, the DAX index has surged into Bull Market territory - up 20% since February\u2019s low. The pound is heading towards its weakest levels since the June referendum, as traders digest this morning\u2019s news. Sterling is still below $1.30 against the US dollar (down 0.5% at $1.298 right now). And against the euro, the pound has lost 0.4% to around \u20ac1.17. That means one euro is worth 85.4p, close to the 85.7p hit at the end of June. That\u2019s bad news for Brits heading to the continent this summer (unless you bought your euros before June 23rd). A weak pound should help tackle Britain\u2019s trade deficit, though -- but only if there is actual demand for UK goods in Europe. If Brexit causes Europe\u2019s economy to stumble, then exporters might not get a currency bounce. Here\u2019s Larry Elliott\u2019s take on today\u2019s widening UK trade gap: City economists agree that June\u2019s trade figures are pretty dire, although it can\u2019t all be blamed on the EU referendum. Ben Gutteridge, Head of Fund Research at Brewin Dolphin, hopes that the weak pound will help in future: \u201cThe deficit in the UK Trade Balance deepened in June and by an amount more than had been expected. The period over which the data has been collected is broadly pre-Brexit but still helps to confirm the widely acknowledged view that the UK is a bigger importer of goods than it is an exporter. Indeed that the UK commands such an important share of European export, it is considered to be an excellent platform from which to negotiate a favourable separation from the European Union. Of course, the politics of extending a favourable deal to non-members does, in some way, defeat the purposes of having a club, so the outcome of such negotiations remain highly uncertain. \u201cAs for trade figures going forward the drop in sterling will have significantly improved the competiveness of our goods and services globally. Over the medium term, therefore, the UK economy can expect to enjoy a genuine boost to activity, allowing the trade balance to narrow; all else equal. But a weak pound will hit people in the pocket, points out the Resolution\u2019s Group\u2019s Duncan Weldon: Sky News\u2019s Ed Conway fears any improvement will take a while.... Economist Rupert Seggins shows that Britain\u2019s been running a trade deficit for over a decade: Former Bank of England policymaker Andrew Sentance says today\u2019s data has limited use when assessing life after Brexit: Today\u2019s figure also show that Britain ran its largest trade gap with Germany - importing \u00a35.5bn but only exporting \u00a32.67bn. Mind you, the UK ran deficits with most countries -- but did post a surplus with Ireland and the US. Alarmingly, Britain\u2019s \u00a312.5bn trade in goods deficit is the worst for any June, ever, and the highest for any month since March 2015. In June alone, Britain exported \u00a312bn of goods and services to the European Union, up by \u00a3500m compared to May. But Britain also imported \u00a320.3bn from the EU, up by \u00a3800m, so the overall trade gap with the EU worsened. Britain\u2019s trade deficit has worsened after imports hit a new alltime high. The UK\u2019s deficit on trade in goods and services jumped to \u00a35.1bn on in June 2016, up from \u00a34.2bn in May, according to the Office for National Statistics. Exports increased by \u00a31.0bn and imports increased by \u00a31.9bn. Imports reached a record high of \u00a348.9bn. The deficit on trade in goods (which strips out the service sector) rose by \u00a3900m to \u00a312.4bn in June 2016, the ONS adds. The report also shows that Britain\u2019s trade deficit with the rest of the European Union has widened by \u00a3400m over the last three months. That\u2019s because the UK continued to import more than it exported back to its EU neighbours. The ONS says: Between Quarter 1 2016 and Quarter 2 2016, exports of goods to EU countries increased by \u00a31.8 billion due to exports of cars, increasing by \u00a30.4 billion to a record quarterly high of \u00a33.2 billion; oil increased by \u00a30.3 billion and both machinery and chemicals increased by \u00a30.2 billion each. For the same period, imports from the EU increased by \u00a32.2 billion to a record quarterly high of \u00a359.4 billion. This increase reflected a \u00a30.8 billion increase in food, beverages and tobacco; a \u00a30.4 billion increase in machinery; a \u00a30.3 billion increase in oil; and a \u00a30.1 billion increase in aircraft to a record high of \u00a30.9 billion. These increases were offset by a decrease in works of art of \u00a30.2 billion. So, not a great picture for a country facing the uncertainty of Brexit. Reaction to follow! Here we go! First... UK industrial output rose by 0.1% during June, meaning output was 1.6% higher than in June 2015. But the narrower manufacturing output measure shrank by 0.3% during the month, worst than the 0.2% decline expected. There\u2019s not much immediate sign of a Brexit hit. Indeed, industrial output over the last three months grew at the fastest quarterly rate sine 1999 - after a knockout April. Transport manufacturing drove the sector forwards. Britain\u2019s EU referendum is already causing angst in the property market. CBRE, the real estate advisor, says that office values fell by 3.3% across the UK in July, with steeper falls in the capital: The fall in capital values was widely expected and pulled year-on-year growth down to 0.4%. Heightened economic uncertainty, especially for financial services firms, hit offices in the City of London, shrinking capital values by -6.1%. And Savills, the estate agent, has reported that profit at its UK commercial property division more than halved in the first six months of this year. It now hopes, though, that things are back to normal now the vote is out of the wa Here\u2019s something to ponder.... according to the markets, the Bank of England won\u2019t raise interest rates for another 66 months! That takes us all the way through to the end of 2021, or 14 years since the crisis began. One of the Bank of England\u2019s policymakers has also undermined the pound, by predicting further interest rate cuts soon. Writing in The Times, Ian McCafferty says: \u201cIf the economy proves to have turned down in line with the initial survey signals, I believe that more easing is likely to be required, but that can easily be delivered in coming months.\u201d McCafferty voted in favour of last week\u2019s rate cut to 0.25%, but opposed the Bank\u2019s new \u00a360bn quantitative easing scheme. That makes him a relatively hawkish member of the committee. Here\u2019s Jill Treanor\u2019s story on the latest push to improve Britain\u2019s banks: Oh wow, Britain\u2019s borrowing costs have just hit a new record low. 10-year UK gilts are changing hands at a yield of just 0.592%, down from 0.609% last night. This makes it an excellent time to boost government borrowing to fund infrastructure projects.... No-one will be surprised to hear that Germany has posted another whopping trade surplus. German firms exported \u20ac106.8bn of goods in June, while the country imported \u00a382bn. That leaves Berlin with a surplus of \u20ac24.9bn, up from \u20ac23.9bn in May. The FT has more details: Exports to the EU accounted for the biggest growth in June \u2013 rising 2.3 per cent to his \u20ac62.7bn in the same month Britain went to vote on membership of the bloc. Imports from the EU to Germany rose 3.3 per cent, while the country\u2019s trade balance with the eurozone narrowed as imports (3 per cent up) outstripped a 0.1 per cent rise in exports. The pound is falling because traders fear bad news at 9.30am, reckons Connor Campbell of SpreadEx: Following a deathly dull and data-less Monday thing should be a bit more interesting this morning, with another wave of UK figures on their way. The reason behind sterling\u2019s Tuesday slide appears to be the prospect of more goods trade deficit bad news, with the gap between Britain\u2019s imports and exports expected to widen to \u00a32.5 billion from \u00a32.2 billion last month. UK consumers are refusing to be alarmed by the Brexit vote, according to a new report released overnight. Retail sales jumped by 1.1% in July, the fastest rate in six months. It was driven by warmer weather, which sent shoppers scrambling for new outfits, plus discounting from stores keen to shift stock. The pound is falling like one of Britain\u2019s fantastic synchronised divers this morning. Traders are selling sterling, as traders wait for this morning\u2019s trade balance and manufacturing report. The pound dropped by half a cent against the US dollar, to $1.298. This is a near one-month low; the pound hasn\u2019t been below $1.30 since mid July. This fall is being driven by expectations that the Bank of England will keep easing monetary policy in the months ahead, as part of its Brexit plans. Lukman Otunuga, research analyst at FXTM, says: Sentiment remains bearish towards the UK economy and speculations may heighten over the Bank of England taking further action if economic data continues to follow this negative path. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Coming up today.... we\u2019re about to discover how Britain\u2019s economy fared in the month of the EU referendum. The latest trade figures for June are due at 9.30am, and are expected to show that the UK ran a chunky current account deficit with the rest of the world (as usual). The gap between what Britain imported and exported is tipped to widen to around \u00a32.5bn in June, compared to \u00a32.2bn in May. And an industrial production report expected to show that manufacturing output fell by 0.2% in June, following a 0.5% decline in May. Other recent data has suggested that business confidence has taken a severe knock, but that consumers are relatively relaxed about the Brexit vote, so today\u2019s data could give new insights into the state of play. Germany is also posting trade data this morning, so we\u2019ll be able to compare its (traditional) trade surplus with the UK deficit. Then at 3pm, the NIESR thinktank publishes its estimate of UK growth in the May-to-July quarter. Will that show a Brexit hit too? Also coming up today.... The Competitions and Markets Authority is publishing its report into UK banking reforms, outlining ways to improve customer service and help the public switch banks. And we\u2019re also getting corporate news from estate agent Savills, and insurer Standard Life.",

Indeed that the UK commands such an important share of European export, it is considered to be an excellent platform from which to negotiate a favourable separation from the European Union. Of course, the politics of extending a favourable deal to non-members does, in some way, defeat the purposes of having a club, so the outcome of such negotiations remain highly uncertain.</p> <p>\u201cAs for trade figures going forward the drop in sterling will have significantly improved the competiveness of our goods and services globally.

      "bodyText": "The board of William Hill has unanimously rejected an \u201copportunistic\u201d \u00a33.6bn takeover bid from casino operator Rank Group and online gambling company 888, arguing it \u201csubstantially undervalues\u201d the high street bookmaker. The two suitors made a joint cash-and-shares proposal worth about 364p a share, which William Hill said represented \u201ca premium of only 16%\u201d to the bookmaker\u2019s share price the day before the consortium signalled its possible offer, when the shares closed at 314p. William Hill also said the proposal contained significant risks as the takeover hinges on cost savings after combining three businesses into one group. Gareth Davis, the bookie\u2019s chairman, said: \u201cThis conditional proposal substantially undervalues William Hill, is highly opportunistic and does not reflect the inherent value of the business. \u201cIt is a very complex three-way combination at a low premium involving substantial risk for William Hill shareholders: execution risk, integration risk and risks of materially increased leverage. The group has a strong team to deliver against our strategy to grow our digital and international businesses so we strongly advise that shareholders take no action.\u201d The consortium said it had identified merger benefits that could boost the value of the proposal to 408p a share. A spokesman for 888 said: \u201cWe thought they were a bit rude about us but we have nothing to add.\u201d The joint approach comes with William Hill at its lowest ebb for some years. The company is looking for a new chief executive after ousting James Henderson last month following the group\u2019s failure to capitalise on a growing online betting market. The online business \u2013 which accounts for about 35% of the bookie\u2019s revenues \u2013 has suffered from problems with the functionality and ease of use of the website. Online growth had been weak in the UK and non-existent internationally, William Hill admitted when announcing its results last month, while the company also issued a profits warning after a poor Cheltenham festival in March. The move by Rank and 888 for William Hill is the latest in a series of upheavals in the gambling sector, which faces increased taxes, growing competition and a crackdown on lucrative fixed-odds betting terminals. Paddy Power and Betfair have already merged, and the joint business is a FTSE 100 member. Ladbrokes has agreed a \u00a32.3bn merger with its rival Gala Coral, which will amalgamate the UK\u2019s second and third-largest high street bookmakers and mean the combination will overtake William Hill in terms of numbers of betting shops. The Competition and Markets Authority cleared the deal last month, but ruled the enlarged company must sell between 350 and 400 shops. Ladbrokes and Gala Coral currently run about 4,000 shops between them. William Hill operates almost 2,400 shops. Rank operates 90 Mecca bingo halls and 60 Grosvenor casinos, while 888 is a purely online gambling brand. William Hill made a pre-tax profit of \u00a3243.7m in its last full year, dwarfing the \u00a373.7m booked by Rank and the $67.9m (\u00a352.2m) at 888.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The Brexit vote helped knock more than \u00a330,000 off the price of an average property in London during July and has sent prices lower nationally, according to estate agent Haart. The month-on-month decline is one of the biggest recorded by Haart, part of a group that includes the Spicer McColl, Felicity J Lord and Darlows brands. In London, the average property price fell from \u00a3558,760 to \u00a3527,349, the equivalent of about a \u00a31,000 drop every day last month. Nationally, prices went down by 0.9%, Haart said, leaving the average UK house price at \u00a3233,254. Rents have also begun to fall, although not by as much as house prices. Haart said the average rent across the UK dropped by 1% in July to \u00a31,547 a month and 1% in London to \u00a31,921. Paul Smith, the chief executive of Haart, said house prices are still ahead over the year and transaction activity remains robust. \u201cWe\u2019ve actually seen a bounce in transactions in July, with a lot of buyers pressing ahead with their purchase now that the referendum is over. Sellers are cutting deals to bypass the uncertainty in the wider economy and plucky buyers are taking advantage,\u201d he said. The 0.25% cut in interest rates made by the Bank of England last week will help prices recover, Smith said. \u201cWhile there is still some uncertainty, it won\u2019t be long before the market bounces back. The only thing we have to fear post-Brexit is fear itself,\u201d he added. The Haart figures match Halifax data, which showed a 1% fall nationally in July, but are the first to show prices tumbling in the capital. The impact of Brexit has been most dramatic in north and west London, Haart said. Postcodes stretching west from Mayfair through Hammersmith and Chiswick saw prices fall by an extraordinary 12.9% on the month alone, while in north London, prices plummeted by 9.3%, knocking \u00a360,000 off the average home. The figures are in line with some of the more dramatic forecasts made since the EU referendum on 23 June. Economists at Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale have said London prices could fall by 30% and halve in the most expensive boroughs. Foxtons and other estate agents have warned that business has slowed sharply since the Brexit vote. The Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors has predicted a slump in property transactions, with its members more gloomy about prospects than at any point since the late 1990s. However, Halifax said month-on-month data is often unreliable and it prefers to rely on quarterly figures. Current growth rates appeared sturdy and there was not enough evidence of any post-referendum effect on house prices, it said. The Halifax housing economist Martin Ellis said: \u201cOverall, it remains too early to determine if there has been any impact on the housing market as a result of June\u2019s EU referendum result.\u201d Falling activity in the lettings market could be a signal of what is happening in the underlying economy. Haart said the number of tenants entering the market fell by 8.3% in July and 4.3% annually, helping explain the decline in rents over the month. Landlords are also retreating from the rental market, with the number of new landlords registering their properties down by 19% on the month and 46% annually. However, this is attributed to the increase in stamp duty on second homes and forthcoming tax changes to buy to let, rather than the Brexit vote alone.",

The property company suffered a \u201csignificant fall\u201d in commercial property deals before the vote, it said, which pushed underlying profits at its UK commercial business down 54%, to \u00a32.7m, in the first six months of the year. Savills said many of the big players in central London, such as sovereign wealth funds and international private equity houses, chose to remain on the sidelines, giving some private investors from the Middle East the opportunity to snap up property.

Savills\u2019 investment trading volumes fell 34% in the first six months of the year, but this was offset by a 37% rise in residential profits, to \u00a37.4m.

Commercial property was hit by the Brexit vote, as panicking investors pulled out their money, forcing several property funds to halt trading. Standard Life was the first company to shut one of its funds for redemptions, on 4 July. Its chief executive, Keith Skeoch, defended the decision on Tuesday, saying it was necessary to stop a \u201cfire sale\u201d of property. He described the closure as a circuit breaker to head off a panic in the market. Standard Life reviewed the closure after 28 days and decided to keep the fund closed. It will review its decision again after another month. The fund has been selling property in the market, Skeoch said. The Edinburgh-based insurer and investment firm rode out the market volatility and reported an 18% rise in first-half operating profits, which were \u00a3341m.

    "webTitle": "China-UK investment: key questions following Hinkley Point C delay", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The relationship between the British and Chinese governments is under strain after the prime minister, Theresa May, decided to delay approval of the planned \u00a318bn Hinkley Point C nuclear power station because of concerns over China\u2019s 30% stake in the project. The move has prompted a warning from the Chinese ambassador to the UK, Liu Xiaoming, who said in a pointed Financial Times comment piece that relations with Britain were at a \u201ccrucial historical juncture\u201d. Here are some of the key questions regarding the Sino-British relationship after the Hinkley Point delay. Why does Hinkley Point need Chinese investment? Building nuclear power stations is expensive, and prone to cost and time overruns. The Hinkley Point project is already heavily subsidised by UK taxpayers, while EDF, the French largely state owned company overseeing the project, is under significant financial stress. That is why EDF brought China General Nuclear Power Corporation on board to take a 33% stake in the project and help spread the financial load. China is also expected to have a significant role in future reactors at Sizewell in Suffolk and Bradwell in Essex, which is one of May\u2019s biggest concerns. Why is the UK courting Chinese investment? Investment from abroad is particularly important when you have a large current account deficit, meaning more money flowing out of the country than coming in. The UK\u2019s current account deficit was 6.9% of GDP in the first three months of the year, just shy of a record high of 7.2% in the fourth quarter of 2015. When an economy has a large current account deficit, it needs foreign money to help plug the gap in what is referred to as the balance of payments. One way to do so is to offset the current account deficit with a surplus in the capital account, which includes items such as investment from abroad. Thankfully, China has deep pockets, running a huge current account surplus. Last year, the then chancellor, George Osborne, said 265,000 British jobs owed their existence to China. What does China own in the UK? While the UK is not one of China\u2019s top three investment destinations, Britain comes top in Europe, attracting more Chinese cash than Germany, France and Italy combined. Chinese investors have sunk about $38bn (\u00a329bn) into everything from prime London real estate to banks and football clubs since 2005, according to figures from the American Enterprise Institute and the Heritage Foundation. Three Chinese sovereign wealth funds are huge investors in the UK. Safe holds 1% of BP and China Investment Corporation has 9% of Thames Water and 1% of Diageo, the maker of Guinness and Johnnie Walker whisky. Shanghai-based Bright Foods owns 60% of Weetabix, while Pizza Express, Sunseeker yachts, House of Fraser and Wentworth golf club are all Chinese owned. Chinese investors are also keen on British football clubs, particularly in the Midlands. Aston Villa and Wolverhampton Wanderers were both bought by Chinese investors, while West Bromwich Albion is being sold to a Chinese investment group. Investors CMC own a 13% stake in Manchester City. What Sino-British deals have been signed recently? During the state visit of the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, last October, the government announced \u00a340bn of UK-Chinese partnerships, including Hinkley. BP agreed a \u00a36.5bn contract to supply liquefied natural gas to China Huadian Corporation, while Rolls-Royce signed a \u00a31.6bn deal to supply Trent 700 engines to aviation company HNA Group. China Construction Bank agreed to provide up to \u00a36bn of funding to help regenerative medicine and tissue engineering research at Oxford University. Aston Martin sealed a \u00a350m deal with China Equity to develop its zero-emissions RapidE sports car, while London Taxi Company owner Geely will invest \u00a350m in research and a new fleet of black cabs capable of zero emissions. Chinese investment is also crucial for the Northern Powerhouse project, which was placed in doubt by the departure of Osborne, its architect. This has stoked fears that any cooling of relations with Beijing could damage efforts to narrow the economic gulf between the south-east and the north of England. What future infrastructure investment will need Chinese cash? Ambitious projects require billions of dollars of investment and Chinese infrastructure investors are among those with cash to spend. Last year, Osborne called on Chinese companies to bid for contracts worth nearly \u00a312bn to build High Speed 2, the planned rail line between London and the Midlands. A third runway at Heathrow would also involve Chinese investment, because 10% of Heathrow Holdings is owned by CIC. Are there national security concerns about Chinese investment? Fears about allowing China such close involvement with highly sensitive nuclear projects are thought to be among the reasons for delaying final approval for Hinkley Point. The former shadow energy secretary Lisa Nandy called on the government to reassure the public amid reports of concerns from members of the intelligence community. One such worry is thought to be the possibility that Chinese workers could install a backdoor system, giving Beijing the potential to shut down Britain\u2019s nuclear power stations and use them as leverage in any future diplomatic row. It is not just nuclear technology that has set alarm bells ringing. Chinese telecoms company Huawei is keen to expand in the UK, but intelligence agencies are wary. By way of compromise, Huawei employs a team of independent cybersecurity experts, overseen by British intelligence, at a secretive Oxfordshire centre known as the Cell. Have other countries shied away from Chinese investment? Earlier this year, the Australian treasurer, Scott Morrison, blocked the sale of S Kidman &amp; Co to a Chinese consortium. The Australian company owned land equivalent to 1.3% of the country and the potential sale fuelled concerns about the scale of China\u2019s investments in Australia. A previous bid was also blocked, in part due to national security concerns, because some of Kidman\u2019s land is close to a nuclear testing site. Huawei was also barred from tendering to take part in Australia\u2019s $38bn nationwide superfast broadband rollout. The US has been equally mistrustful of Chinese investment, largely due to fears of the potential for cyberespionage. Huawei and fellow telecoms company ZTE were deemed a threat to national security by a US congressional committee, and are blocked from winning contracts for the military and Pentagon. Why does China like the UK so much? Chinese investors do not spend their money out of affection for Britain; they do so largely because there is money to be made. But there are other factors that make the UK an attractive place to store cash, particularly for private investors. One of these is a stable regulatory and legal system. Business leaders sometimes fall foul of the regime in autocratic countries such as China, and when they do, they risk having their assets appropriated by the state. The same risk exists for investments in volatile economies around the world. That might explain why so much Chinese money has been poured into UK real estate, a solid investment governed by a predictable and fair legal system. Chinese investors have put more than $12bn into UK property, nearly a third of the country\u2019s overall investment in Britain.",

      "body": "<p>The relationship between the British and Chinese governments is under strain after the prime minister, Theresa May, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jul/28/hinkley-point-c-to-go-ahead-after-edf-board-approves-project\">decided to delay approval</a> of the planned \u00a318bn Hinkley Point C nuclear power station because of concerns over China\u2019s 30% stake in the project.</p> <p>The move has prompted a warning from the Chinese ambassador to the UK, Liu Xiaoming, who said in a pointed <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b8bc62dc-5d74-11e6-bb77-a121aa8abd95\">Financial Times comment piece</a> that relations with Britain were at a \u201ccrucial historical juncture\u201d. Here are some of the key questions regarding the Sino-British relationship after the Hinkley Point delay.</p> <p><strong>Why does Hinkley Point need Chinese investment?</strong></p> <p>Building nuclear power stations is expensive, and prone to cost and time overruns. The Hinkley Point project is already heavily subsidised by UK taxpayers, while EDF, the French largely state owned company overseeing the project, is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/oct/22/broker-tells-investors-sell-edf-shares-hinkley-point-costs\">under significant financial stress</a>. </p> <p>That is why EDF brought China General Nuclear Power Corporation on board to take a 33% stake in the project and help spread the financial load. China is also expected to have a significant role in future reactors at Sizewell in Suffolk and Bradwell in Essex, which is one of May\u2019s biggest concerns.</p> <p><strong>Why is the UK courting Chinese investment?</strong></p> <p>Investment from abroad is particularly important when you have a large current account deficit, meaning more money flowing out of the country than coming in. The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jun/30/uk-current-account-deficit-deepens-brexit-fears\">UK\u2019s current account deficit</a> was 6.9% of GDP in the first three months of the year, just shy of a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/mar/31/uk-economy-growth-record-trade-deficit\">record high of 7.2%</a> in the fourth quarter of 2015. </p> <p>When an economy has a large current account deficit, it needs foreign money to help plug the gap in what is referred to as the balance of payments. One way to do so is to offset the current account deficit with a surplus in the capital account, which includes items such as investment from abroad. Thankfully, China has deep pockets, running a huge current account surplus.</p> <p>Last year, the then chancellor, George Osborne, said 265,000 British jobs <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-34341352\">owed their existence to China</a>.<br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/aug/09/government-says-links-with-china-are-vital-after-hinkley-point-warning\">Government says links with China are vital after Hinkley Point warning</a> </p> </aside>  <p><strong>What does China own in the UK?</strong><br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2016/08/china-directinvestment/giv-31075W7oHdNK0jqv6/\" data-alt=\"Comparison with France, Germany and Italy\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2016/08/china-directinvestment/giv-31075W7oHdNK0jqv6/\">Comparison with France, Germany and Italy</a> </figure>  <p>While the UK is not one of China\u2019s top three investment destinations, Britain comes top in Europe, attracting more Chinese cash than Germany, France and Italy combined.

      "bodyText": "Morrisons will be able to extend online deliveries into south London, Scotland, East Anglia and the north-east of England next year after signing a new deal with Ocado. The expansion comes after Ocado, which has been running the technology and delivery network for Morrisons\u2019 online business since it launched in 2014, agreed to develop a new IT system to allow the supermarket to serve online shoppers from its stores as well as Ocado\u2019s central warehouse in Dordon, Warwickshire. It has also agreed to deliver thousands more non-food items not currently offered on Morrisons\u2019 website. David Potts, chief executive of Morrisons, which has been struggling to fight back against rising competition from discounters Aldi and Lidl as well as online shopping, said: \u201cThe new investments in online growth are further examples of Morrisons building a broader business.\u201d Under the new arrangement Morrisons will halve the amount it pays towards Ocado\u2019s research and development to \u00a34m a year from 2018 and will no longer pay a 25% cut of any future profits from its online business for the next 15 years. In return, Morrisons has agreed to help fund 30% of the costs of developing Ocado\u2019s new distribution centre in Erith, south London, which is due to open in 2018. It has also allowed the online specialist to run branded online services for other retailers potentially including Marks &amp; Spencer and the Co-op. It continues to be blocked from providing similar services to major Morrisons competitors \u2013 Tesco, Sainsbury\u2019s, Asda, Aldi and Lidl. Under its new deal with Morrisons, Ocado could also renegotiate its tie-up with Waitrose. The upmarket grocer currently sells goods via Ocado\u2019s own online service but the supermarket operates Waitrose.com deliveries itself from stores. Analysts said the new deal was good news for both Ocado and Morrisons. The terms of the continuing relationship are clearly better for the supermarket than the widely-criticised deal it originally cut with Ocado. Morrisons paid \u00a3140m to buy the Dordon site and equipment as well as \u00a316m towards expanding capacity on top of a licence and integration fee of \u00a330m. The deal offers access to about 60,000 orders per week or \u00a3350m of new online business out of the Erith distribution centre by 2020 for a lower sum, although the details were not revealed on Tuesday. For Ocado, analysts said the agreement bolstered the online specialist\u2019s attempts to find new clients for its services which it now calls the \u201cOcado Smart Platform\u201d. Analysts at Goldman Sachs said in a note: \u201cThe deal represents the first OSP client it has signed and the reduced exclusivity opens the door for providing OSP solutions to other UK grocery retailers.\u201d Ocado promised the City that it would sign up a new overseas partner before the end of last year but its share price has dived by more than 28% since November as it failed to finalise any such agreement.",

      "bodyText": "Investigations into the structure of banking in Britain have become rather a cottage industry. There have been 11 separate inquiries into the sector in the past 17 years. Thousands of hours have been spent taking testimony from expert witnesses. Millions of words have been written. And nothing much has changed. As in 1999, the big four of HSBC, Barclays, Royal Bank of Scotland and Lloyds Banking Group have a stranglehold on the market. Between them, they hold 77% of personal accounts and 85% of business accounts. Attempts to inject more competition into the industry have proved difficult. It seems highly unlikely that the latest investigation, carried out by the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA), will unduly concern the big four. They were certainly a lot more worried when the investigation was launched two years ago, because at the time, the Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition government felt the need to respond to Ed Miliband\u2019s suggestion that the oligopoly should be broken up. In the end, the fruit of the past two years seems to amount to little more than a new mobile app to help customers save money by switching bank accounts. The idea is that people will be keener on moving from one bank to another if there is more transparency about charges and interest rates. The charitable response to the CMA\u2019s report is that it is proportionate to the scale of the problem. Given that only 3% of customers switch banks in any given year, it could be argued that the public is generally happy with the service being provided. Or, perhaps, not unhappy enough to up sticks and move somewhere else. From this perspective, breaking up the big four would be to use a sledgehammer to crack a walnut. But hang on a second. Harnessing new technology is all very well and there will no doubt be bank customers willing to trawl around for the best deal. On past form, though, they will tend to be well heeled customers with accounts in credit. The people who really need help from the CMA are the less well off; those who struggle to make ends meet and slide into the red. Banks charge penal rates for unauthorised overdrafts, which can be more expensive than payday loans. It was perhaps unrealistic, given Miliband\u2019s defeat at the 2015 general election, to imagine that the CMA would break up the banks. But it was not unrealistic to expect that it might put strict caps on the overdraft charges banks can levy. This, unfortunately, is a weak and disappointing report from a toothless watchdog.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "A package of measures intended to help customers save \u00a392 a year by switching their bank accounts has faced criticism for failing to do enough to encourage competition among the high street banks. After two-year investigation into the sector, the competition watchdog said technological advances that helped the development of Uber and Google Maps would make it easier for customers to compare bank accounts and should encourage customers to shop around. The \u00a35m investigation by the Competition and Markets Authority \u2013 first announced in July 2014 when former Labour leader Ed Miliband was vowing to create new banks \u2013 is intended to kickstart competition in a sector where only 3% of personal and 4% of business customers switch to a different bank in any year. It also tried to tackle the \u00a31.2bn a year the banks make from unarranged overdraft charges, as customers with overdrafts find it more difficult to change accounts. Banks will be required to send alerts to customers going into the red and set a monthly cap on such charges, which some campaigners argue are higher than those levied by payday lenders such as Wonga. But Alex Neill, director of policy and campaigns at consumer watchdog Which?, said: \u201cIt is disappointing that the monthly charge cap is not actually a cap and banks will be allowed to continue to charge exorbitant fees for so-called unauthorised overdrafts, rather than protect those customers that have been identified as among the most vulnerable.\u201d The CMA stepped back from breaking up the big four \u2013 Lloyds Banking Group, Royal Bank of Scotland, HSBC and Barclays \u2013 which control 77% of the current account market and more than 80% of small business accounts. The key plank of the proposals is the adoption of new technology in 2018 that will enable customers to see hidden charges applied to their accounts, allowing them to shop around for the best deal. This might eventually happen through the creation of a \u201cdigital app\u201d or a sophisticated price comparison website \u2013 but this \u201copen banking\u201d technology will need to be developed.

      "bodyText": "Barclays has reached a $100m (\u00a377m) settlement with more than 40 US states for fraudulent and anticompetitive conduct in relation to the Libor rigging scandal. The agreement, announced by the New York attorney general, Eric Schneiderman, follows the \u00a3290m fine imposed on Barclays four years ago by UK regulators \u2013 and others such as the US Department of Justice \u2013 for manipulating the benchmark interest rate. Barclays is the first of several banks involved in setting the US dollar Libor to resolve investigations with attorney generals across the US. Seven states are not involved in this latest agreement. Schneiderman said government entities and not-for-profit organisations were defrauded of funds because they did not know Barclays and other financial firms were manipulating the rate, which is used to price an estimated $350tn of financial products. \u201cThere has to be one set of rules for everyone, no matter how rich or how powerful, and that includes big banks and other financial institutions that engage in fraud or impair the fair functioning of financial markets,\u201d said Schneiderman. \u201cAs a result of Barclays\u2019s misconduct, government entities and not-for-profits were defrauded of funds that otherwise could have been used to benefit the people of New York.\u201d The settlement agreement (pdf) included details of emails and conversations between Barclays staff about making changes to the Libor rate during two periods: during the financial crisis when the bank tried to reduce its rate to avoid the idea it was in trouble, and later to benefit the positions of traders. Barclays said it was pleased to have resolved the investigation. \u201cWe believe this settlement is in the best interests of our shareholders and clients, and allows us to continue to focus on the future and serve our clients,\u201d the bank said. The way Libor is calculated has been changed since the scandal, but at the time, it was set by a panel of banks making submissions about the rate they thought they would be asked to pay to borrow from rival banks over different time frames. In one exchange in December 2007, a Barclays employee involved in submitting rates told his supervisor: \u201cAt the same time that we were setting at 5.30% I was paying 5.40% ... in the market. Given a free hand I would have set at around 5.45% ... My worry is that we [both Barclays and the contributor bank panel] are being seen to be contributing patently false rates.

    "webTitle": "Never had it so good? The misconceptions about the cost of living | Greg Jericho", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "If there is one topic that gets me the most criticism, it is the cost of living. Since writing for Guardian Australia, whenever I write on the topic I am bound to get smashed in the comments section. Partly this is my own fault, partly due to people\u2019s innate beliefs about the cost of living, and partly due to the way the cost of living and inflation is measured, which can understate the importance of essential items in the overall inflation figure. When I examined the latest cost of living figures last week, surprisingly the growth for aged pensioner households was lower than that for employee households \u2013 and the rate for both was below that official inflation growth figures: It meant that if you used employee cost of living as the inflation measure, real wages growth was actually pretty good \u2013 as good as it had been during the mining boom: As I found this surprising, I wrote my piece, suggesting while those with a job and a mortgage might not be able to say they have never had it so good, things weren\u2019t as bad as they might seem. And I got smashed in the comments. Fair enough too, because there\u2019s always a lot of caveats with such grandiose statements. It was very specific to one group, and required, for example, those employees who have jobs to have not had a reduction in hours. Sure, their hourly pay rate might have increased, but if the hours worked had decreased than real wage calculations don\u2019t help much. But with cost of living there are always a lot of misconceptions, and it is perhaps the only time I have some small sympathy with politicians who can never suggest cost of living pressures are weak for fear of being smashed by their opponents, the media and voters. Part of the problem is what I call the \u201cnominal rate fallacy\u201d. If wages are growing by 4% a year and your cost of living is growing by 3%, for some reason that can feel better than if your wages are growing by 2% and costs are only going up by 1% even though in both cases real wages are growing by 1%. It\u2019s also an issue of how important is real wage growth \u2013 and does it measure anything of any great worth? Yes we should hope that our wages rise faster than inflation \u2013 were it not to happen our standard of living would be falling. But does strong real wages growth tell us much? If we look across the different states, the state with the strongest real wages growth is South Australia: And yet that state has the highest unemployment rate in the nation \u2013 so strong wage growth doesn\u2019t always suggest strong employment. Another issue is that cost of living and inflation are just averages. As a result the ABS estimates how much households spend on various items, and because it is an average they come up with an average household that represents no one. For example in the CPI basket of goods, the ABS estimates on average 6.71% of a households weekly budget is spent on rent and 8.67% is spent on the purchase of a new dwelling, and to top it all off 3.25% is spent buying a new car. Now obviously no household spends like that, but on average all households across Australia do, even if no single household does. And while you might think it renders the measurement useless it at least gives us a guide because we cannot measure the inflation for every single household in Australia. The problem however is that there are some aspects which can really skew the measurement for specific households. The ABS, for example, estimates that households spend 7% of the weekly budget on alcohol and tobacco. Because tobacco prices rise massively due to excise increases this means if you exclude alcohol and tobacco from the CPI instead of a 1% rise in inflation it is just 0.6%. But what about if you are a smoker? The average of 7% covers smokers and non-smokers, meaning that smokers would necessarily spend more than that amount on cigarettes. And while inflation in the past 10 years has risen 26%, the price of alcohol and cigarettes has risen 67%: So if you are a smoker, hearing talk of low inflation wouldn\u2019t really pass muster. Another problem is that people can assume some things are rising by more than they really are because in the past they were rising faster than they are now. Rents are a very good example of this. In the past 10 years in Sydney for example rental prices were rising by as much as 8%, by up to 10% in Brisbane and nearly 14% in Perth. But in all cities now rental price growth is very low: But while that is great now, it also means that the low rise in cost of living might not make up for large increases in previous years \u2013 especially for more essential items. And that is another problem with the inflation measure \u2013 it assumes a set amount is spent each week, and doesn\u2019t assume that if the price of something such as gas or electricity rise that you don\u2019t then stop spending money on something else \u2013 even if that something else has gone down in price. Over the past 15 years, the price of utilities, property rates, insurance and medical costs has far outstripped wages growth: On the other hand, the price of items such as domestic holiday travel and accommodation, AV and computing equipment, communication equipment and services has risen well below that of wages: The whole basket of goods does then suggest cost of living pressures are weak \u2013 and real wages are growing. But when broken down, and considered by how prices of various items \u2013 especially essential items \u2013 have in the past outstripped wages growth and how perhaps price falls are occurring more among the more luxury items, it\u2019s not surprising that many would suggest cost of living pressures remain, regardless of what the overall figures suggest.",

      "body": "<p>If there is one topic that gets me the most criticism, it is the cost of living. Since writing for Guardian Australia, whenever I write on the topic I am bound to get smashed in the comments section. Partly this is my own fault, partly due to people\u2019s innate beliefs about the cost of living, and partly due to the way the cost of living and inflation is measured, which can understate the importance of essential items in the overall inflation figure. </p> <p>When I examined the latest cost of living figures <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/grogonomics/2016/aug/04/despite-low-wage-growth-weve-never-had-it-so-good-its-a-wacky-state-of-affairs\">last week</a>, surprisingly the growth for aged pensioner households was lower than that for employee households \u2013 and the rate for both was below that official inflation growth figures:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Annual growth of cost of living compared to CPI\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/yJRqH/1/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>It meant that if you used employee cost of living as the inflation measure, real wages growth was actually pretty good \u2013 as good as it had been during the mining boom:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Wages and cost of living\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/ajsS1/1/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>As I found this surprising, I wrote my piece, suggesting while those with a job and a mortgage might not be able to say they have never had it so good, things weren\u2019t as bad as they might seem. </p> <p>And I got smashed in the comments. </p> <p>Fair enough too, because there\u2019s always a lot of caveats with such grandiose statements. It was very specific to one group, and required, for example, those employees who have jobs to have not had a reduction in hours. Sure, their hourly pay rate might have increased, but if the hours worked had decreased than real wage calculations don\u2019t help much. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/grogonomics/2016/aug/04/despite-low-wage-growth-weve-never-had-it-so-good-its-a-wacky-state-of-affairs\">Despite low wage growth we've never had it so good. It's a wacky state of affairs | Greg Jericho</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But with cost of living there are always a lot of misconceptions, and it is perhaps the only time I have some small sympathy with politicians who can never suggest cost of living pressures are weak for fear of being smashed by their opponents, the media and voters. </p> <p>Part of the problem is what I call the \u201cnominal rate fallacy\u201d. If wages are growing by 4% a year and your cost of living is growing by 3%, for some reason that can feel better than if your wages are growing by 2% and costs are only going up by 1% even though in both cases real wages are growing by 1%. </p> <p>It\u2019s also an issue of how important is real wage growth \u2013 and does it measure anything of any great worth? Yes we should hope that our wages rise faster than inflation \u2013 were it not to happen our standard of living would be falling. </p> <p>But does strong real wages growth tell us much? </p> <p>If we look across the different states, the state with the strongest real wages growth is South Australia: </p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Annual wages growth across the nation\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/3eimc/1/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>And yet that state has the highest unemployment rate in the nation \u2013 so strong wage growth doesn\u2019t always suggest strong employment. </p> <p>Another issue is that cost of living and inflation are just averages. As a result the ABS estimates how much households spend on various items, and because it is an average they come up with an average household that represents no one. </p> <p>For example in the CPI basket of goods, the ABS estimates on average 6.71% of a households weekly budget is spent on rent and 8.67% is spent on the purchase of a new dwelling, and to top it all off 3.25% is spent buying a new car. </p> <p>Now obviously no household spends like that, but on average all households across Australia do, even if no single household does. And while you might think it renders the measurement useless it at least gives us a guide because we cannot measure the inflation for every single household in Australia. </p> <p>The problem however is that there are some aspects which can really skew the measurement for specific households. </p> <p>The ABS, for example, estimates that households spend 7% of the weekly budget on alcohol and tobacco. Because tobacco prices rise massively due to excise increases this means if you exclude alcohol and tobacco from the CPI instead of a 1% rise in inflation it is just 0.6%.</p> <p>But what about if you are a smoker? The average of 7% covers smokers and non-smokers, meaning that smokers would necessarily spend more than that amount on cigarettes. </p> <p>And while inflation in the past 10 years has risen 26%, the price of alcohol and cigarettes has risen 67%:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Annual growth of inflation and cost of alcohol and tobacco\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/8DJIv/1/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>So if you are a smoker, hearing talk of low inflation wouldn\u2019t really pass muster. </p> <p>Another problem is that people can assume some things are rising by more than they really are because in the past they were rising faster than they are now. Rents are a very good example of this. </p> <p>In the past 10 years in Sydney for example rental prices were rising by as much as 8%, by up to 10% in Brisbane and nearly 14% in Perth. But in all cities now rental price growth is very low:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Annual growth of rental prices - past 10 years\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/QPzmx/3/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>But while that is great now, it also means that the low rise in cost of living might not make up for large increases in previous years \u2013 especially for more essential items. </p> <p>And that is another problem with the inflation measure \u2013 it assumes a set amount is spent each week, and doesn\u2019t assume that if the price of something such as gas or electricity rise that you don\u2019t then stop spending money on something else \u2013 even if that something else has gone down in price.</p> <p>Over the past 15 years, the price of utilities, property rates, insurance and medical costs has far outstripped wages growth:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Wages, inflation and prices of various items (essentials)\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/WZMxX/1/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>On the other hand, the price of items such as domestic holiday travel and accommodation, AV and computing equipment, communication equipment and services has risen well below that of wages:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Wages, inflation and prices of various items\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/WHK3G/1/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>The whole basket of goods does then suggest cost of living pressures are weak \u2013 and real wages are growing. </p> <p>But when broken down, and considered by how prices of various items \u2013 especially essential items \u2013 have in the past outstripped wages growth and how perhaps price falls are occurring more among the more luxury items, it\u2019s not surprising that many would suggest cost of living pressures remain, regardless of what the overall figures suggest.</p>",
