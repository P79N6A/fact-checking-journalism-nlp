      "bodyText": "The latest IMF world economic outlook released on Wednesday suggests stagnant growth for the year ahead, and warns that unless nations take efforts to shift their economies out of the rut, political movements against trade will continue to thrive and will also likely lead to lower growth in the future. Since the GFC, the IMF world economic outlook reports have made for pretty depressing reading. Titles such of \u201cToo Slow for Too Long\u201d, from April this year, are about as cheery as it gets. This time the title \u201cSubdued demand: Symptoms and Remedies\u201d reflects the continuation of this generally downcast outlook. It says something that the bright aspect of the report is the suggestion that while things are not really getting better for the world economy, neither are they getting worse. Instead the IMF finds that the world economy is \u201cmoving sideways\u201d. Woohoo! This has meant for the first time in a long while there was no significant downgrade in the projection for world GDP growth. The 3.1% growth that was predicted in July remains in place. That\u2019s good news (of sorts) but a long way below the IMF\u2019s highest estimate back in September 2011 of 4.9%: But while the world GDP growth prediction remains steady, the outlook for advanced economies has been revised down yet again \u2013 from the 1.8% in July to just 1.6%, and massively down on the 2.2% predicted a year ago. The two big reasons for the slow-down in the advanced economies is a weaker than expected growth in the USA and the fallout from the Brexit vote. This time last year, the IMF was expecting the UK economy to be growing by 2.2%. The uncertainty of the Brexit vote saw them downgrade that to 1.9% in April and 1.7% in July. The good news is the IMF now expects the UK to grow by 1.8%. But when asked if this showed that the IMF had overestimated the impact of the Brexit vote, Maurice Obstfeld, the director of the IMF research department argued the sharp devaluing of the UK pound had helped keep the UK\u2019s economy growing better than would be expected (as it made its exports) but that the long term issues remained. For Australia, the situation is better in the short-term as well. The IMF has upgraded our forecast growth for this year from 2.5% to 2.9%: Alas the upgrades for Australia and the UK don\u2019t continue into next year. The IMF downgraded the growth projection for Australia in 2017 from 2.5% to 2.2%, while the projection for UK growth has been halved in the past 12 months. Last year the IMF anticipated the UK\u2019s economy growing by 2.2% in 2017; now it expects a pitiful 1.1%: The slowdown in the USA, where the IMF has downgraded growth projections for this year from the 2.2% in July to now just 1.6% is due mostly to falling business investment and \u201cdiminishing pace of stockpiles of goods\u201d. That such a slowdown appears not to have affected the likely chances of Hillary Clinton winning the election highlights how much better the chances for the Republican Party would have been had they not picked Donald Trump as its candidate. The IMF does note that the continued \u201csubdued\u201d growth is having political impacts. It says that the slow recovery after the GFC has been \u201cespecially damaging in those countries where the distribution of income has continued to skew sharply toward the highest earners\u201d. In short, the IMF argues, \u201cgrowth has been too low for too long, and in many countries its benefits have reached too few.\u201d They suggest the impact of inequality has been a driver of a \u201cpolitical movement that blames globalisation for all woes and seeks somehow to wall off the economy from global trends rather than engage cooperatively with foreign nations.\u201d The IMF argues that because international trade is a key driver of economic growth, the movement to increase trade barriers will \u201clikely to depress global growth further.\u201d Instead it argues that nations need to work together. On this score the IMF remains praising of the efforts by Joe Hockey and Tony Abbott when hosting the G20 conference in Brisbane in 2014 to co-ordinate a growth target. The IMF argues that to spur stronger growth, economic policies must be comprehensive \u2013 pointedly arguing against relying on low interest rates, and instead arguing for more fiscal stimulus. Here the IMF points to the stimulus provided this year by the Canadian government and in the United States. The data shows that the Australian government remains more focused on reducing the deficit and leaving the work of stimulating the economy mostly on the shoulders of the Reserve Bank: The good news for Australia is that we look to be well past the peak of our unemployment. Concerns the unemployment rate might remain above 6% this year and into 2017 have been replaced with predictions of it being down to around 5.3% by the end of the decade: Australia\u2019s economy also continues to do well among its economic peers. The IMF estimates Australia will continue to grow stronger than most non-developing nations in the G20: It also continues to estimate that India will be the fastest growing economy out to 2021. But China continues to be engine for world economic growth. While the USA\u2019s economy will remain the largest in the world, China will drive significantly more of the growth of world GDP than the USA and a great deal more than India: In the new normal of the post-GFC world, sideways is the new up. The lack of major downgrades to growth projections makes a nice change, but shows that keeping on with the policies of the pre-GFC world, where monetary policy was considered to be the best way to stimulate the economy, is not up to the task. Australia\u2019s growth continues to do well compared with other nations, but below what was once considered average. And so long as the government is more concerned about budget \u201crepair\u201d, that is likely to be the case.",

She used it in her pitch to be Tory leader in July and rolled it out again, almost word for word, in her conference speech. We must assume she\u2019s serious. If so, she had better be ready for a backlash from business that will match the outcry over Amber Rudd\u2019s weird demand for companies to disclose the number of foreign workers they employ. On workers\u2019 representatives, FTSE 100 chairman and chief executives tend to fall into two camps. The first crew think May is engaged in tokenism and that her reform would make little difference. The other rolls its eyes with disdain and accuses the prime minister of failing to understand how large companies operate and how they are owned. To feel the size of the philosophical chasm, consider fund manager Legal &amp; General Investment Management\u2019s latest proposal on boardroom pay, the issue that has triggered the political interest in the make-up of boards. LGIM is usually regarded as being at the enlightened end of City thinking on pay; it often votes against the worst excesses. But its big idea is merely that bosses should meet employees every year to justify their remuneration decisions. That is miles away from May\u2019s vision. If the prime minister is true to her public statements, she would surely regard a conversation as a feeble cop-out. It is hard to see how the two sides can possibly meet in the middle. You either have worker and consumer representatives on boards or you don\u2019t. A voluntary code would be ignored. Giving current non-executives formal duties to look out for workers\u2019 and consumers\u2019 interests would be a pointless exercise in verbal gymnastics. A clash is coming. As it happens, this column is sympathetic to May\u2019s line of thinking. She is correct to think mutual backscratching is alive and well in UK boardrooms, especially when pay is being decided. She is also right to argue that overthrowing a cosy culture involves changing the people around the boardroom table. There are other ways to address the problem, however. Tory MP Chris Philp has suggested a Scandinavian-style system in which a committee of large shareholders would propose the non-executives, thereby reducing the chair\u2019s power to appoint his or her chums. It\u2019s an interesting idea, carries support from the likes of lauded fund manager Neil Woodford, and would be relatively easy to implement. But it is not May\u2019s proposal. Instead, she is on collision course with the business establishment. Good luck; the showdown could become a defining battle of her leadership. Treading on Bank of England\u2019s turf The prime minister also needs to learn to speak carefully when treading on the Bank of England\u2019s turf. At one point she said super-low interest rates and quantitative easing had had some bad side effects. \u201cPeople with assets have got richer, people without them have suffered,\u201d she said, before returning to her riff that change is coming. What sort of change would reverse those ill effects? Was she planning to abolish Threadneedle Street\u2019s indpendence to set interest rates? Nothing of the sort, of course, as Number 10 was obliged to explain. May was merely indicating that her government will be at the service of those who have found themselves poorer as a result of monetary policy. What does that mean? Absolutely nothing of substance, it seems. Governor Mark Carney can sleep easily, even if he is a foreign worker in the UK. Tesco gains doesn\u2019t guarantee dividends There was no dividend, or even a hint of when one may return, but Tesco shareholders\u2019 expectations are set low these days. All it took for the share price to rise 10% on Wednesday was a decent set of first-half results plus a prediction by chief executive Dave Lewis that profit margins will improve to 3.5%-4% eventually. One shouldn\u2019t be sniffy, of course. Lewis has delivered on the top two priorities he set on arrival two years ago. He has been nicer to customers, in the sense of cutting prices by 6%, thereby reversing the leakage of sales to competitors. And he has made peace with suppliers \u2013 he can point to a big jump in \u201csatisfaction\u201d measures. The margin ambition (please don\u2019t call it a target because that is how his predecessor tripped up) was designed to signal to shareholders that they will reap the fruits of those labours. Fair enough \u2013 reassurance is usually welcome. But the enthusiasm in the share price looks overdone. The margin ambition is for three years\u2019 time. Tesco\u2019s debt still isn\u2019t investment grade. And the \u00a36bn deficit in the pension fund can\u2019t be ignored entirely, even if it is the product of the madness of pension accounting. Investors should judge Lewis when he has restored dividends. He\u2019s not there yet.",

At one point she said super-low interest rates and quantitative easing had had some bad side effects. \u201cPeople with assets have got richer, people without them have suffered,\u201d she said, before returning to her riff that change is coming.</p> <p>What sort of change would reverse those ill effects? Was she planning to abolish Threadneedle Street\u2019s indpendence to set interest rates? Nothing of the sort, of course, as Number 10 was obliged to explain. May was merely indicating that her government will be at the service of those who have found themselves poorer as a result of monetary policy.</p> <p>What does that mean? Absolutely nothing of substance, it seems. Governor Mark Carney can sleep easily, even if he is a foreign worker in the UK.</p> <h2>Tesco gains doesn\u2019t guarantee dividends</h2> <p>There was no dividend, or even a hint of when one may return, but Tesco shareholders\u2019 expectations are set low these days. All it took for the share price to rise 10% on Wednesday was<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/05/tesco-supermarket-sales-rise-profits-tumble\"> a decent set of first-half results </a>plus a prediction by chief executive Dave Lewis that profit margins will improve to 3.5%-4% eventually.</p> <p>One shouldn\u2019t be sniffy, of course. Lewis has delivered on the top two priorities he set on arrival two years ago. He has been nicer to customers, in the sense of cutting prices by 6%, thereby reversing the leakage of sales to competitors. And he has made peace with suppliers \u2013 he can point to a big jump in \u201csatisfaction\u201d measures.</p> <p>The margin ambition (please don\u2019t call it a target because that is how his predecessor tripped up) was designed to signal to shareholders that they will reap the fruits of those labours. Fair enough \u2013 reassurance is usually welcome.</p> <p>But the enthusiasm in the share price looks overdone. The margin ambition is for three years\u2019 time. Tesco\u2019s debt still isn\u2019t investment grade. And the \u00a36bn deficit in the pension fund can\u2019t be ignored entirely, even if it is the product of the madness of pension accounting. Investors should judge Lewis when he has restored dividends. He\u2019s not there yet.</p>",

      "bodyText": "A strong performance by the UK\u2019s services sector in September has allayed concerns that a rebound after the Brexit vote panic would prove temporary. The sector, which accounts for about three-quarters of the economy, beat City expectations with buoyant new order books and a rise in employment, continuing a post referendum recovery that followed a dramatic contraction in July. The pound steadied on the news after falling earlier in the week to a fresh 31-year low of $1.27, while the FTSE 100 index of top companies retained most of its recent gains, losing 41 points to finish at 7033. Markit, which compiled the services industry data, said the strength of the recovery meant the chances of a recession in the second half of 2016 had \u201call but evaporated\u201d. Combined with strong results in September for the manufacturing and construction sectors, the services data also dispelled any lingering fears that the Bank of England might cut interest rates before the end of the year. The financial data provider said the purchasing managers\u2019 index (PMI) for the sector expanded at a slightly weaker rate than August\u2019s 52.9, but stayed above 50, the boundary between growth and contraction, at 52.6, and the slump to 47.4 seen in July. Much of the boost came from a rise in new business, which rose at the fastest pace since February, helped by the fall in sterling. But Markit warned that the measure of company expectations remained very low by historical standards and businesses remained wary that the rebound could fizzle out. Britain\u2019s car industry enjoyed a record September for new vehicle sales, but said Brexit uncertainty could weigh on future demand. The 66 plate helped to lift new car sales by a modest 1.6% last month compared with a year earlier to a total of 469,696, according to the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT). Fleet sales increased 7.3%, offsetting a 1.7% decline in private buyer sales. It was the highest number on record for September, typically a strong month for sales because of the plate change. The top three best sellers were the Ford Fiesta, Vauxhall Corsa and Volkswagen Golf. Chris Williamson, the chief business economist at IHS Markit, which compiled the service sector survey, said: \u201cThe survey results suggest the economy has regained modest growth momentum since the EU referendum, with further service sector expansion accompanied by a return to growth in construction and an especially strong revival of manufacturing. \u201cAcross the three sectors, the pace of economic growth signalled was the strongest since January, fuelling greater job creation as companies shrugged off short-term Brexit worries and enjoyed the benefits of a weaker currency.\u201d Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said the economy was still growing at levels well below those seen between 2013 and 2015. \u201cOn past form, the index in September is consistent with quarter-on-quarter growth in services output of just 0.2%, still a long way below its 0.6% average between 2013 and 2015. \u201cBut fears that the slump in business and consumer confidence after the vote would translate immediately into lower spending appear to have been unfounded,\u201d he said.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The UK has been singled out in a new report as being among the worst countries in the developed world to be a young mother seeking work. The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) said the UK, along with the US, Ireland and New Zealand, scored lowest out of its 35 member states for this demographic, especially when women are in a couple without access to state subsidies. It said women were on average 1.4 times more likely to be not in education, employment or training (Neet) than men. \u201cFor many of them, this is because they are looking after small children and the high cost of childcare is a major barrier to employment. In the United States, Ireland, United Kingdom and New Zealand, childcare costs for a lone parent can account for between one-third and a half of net income,\u201d the OECD said in its report Society at a Glance 2016, which checks on the wellbeing of households across member states. The steep rise in childcare costs in the UK means it is the worst place in the OECD to be a couple with young children, the report said. But the introduction of child tax credits means it is among the best countries to be a single parent, alongside Denmark, Luxembourg, France, Germany and Austria, taking into account childcare costs. However, the UK had one of the lowest rates of youth unemployment, the OECD said, and was more successful than most large economies in allowing young people to combine work and education, beating Germany, the US, Sweden, France and Japan. Italy joined Portugal, Spain and Greece as the worst in offering young people work or both work and education. They also had the highest numbers of Neets. Britain has also seen significant improvements in pupil performance at secondary schools over the last 10 years but still has one of the lowest levels of literacy and numeracy among Neets, according to the OECD report. Well-funded further education institutions are also important to young people who leave school with poor qualifications. But successive governments have cut further education budgets by 14%, adjusted for inflation, since 2010, prompting Labour to say they operate on a shoestring. Turkey has the highest proportion of Neets, followed by Italy, Greece, Spain and Mexico. Britain ranks 19th out of the OECD\u2019s 35 members, with Iceland and the Netherlands having the lowest rates. More generally, the OECD report said that young people found it harder to get a job in 2016 and warned the economic recovery across the developed world may not come to their rescue. The OECD said young people who leave school at 16 with low skills are facing increasing challenges in finding a job. The Paris-based thinktank found that 15% of 15- to 29-year-olds are Neet, at a cost of between $360bn and $605bn, or 0.9% and 1.5% of the OECD\u2019s collective GDP. In much of the postwar period, economic expansion led to youth unemployment rates plummeting, but in the years since 2003, many young people have struggled to acquire the skills needed to succeed in the jobs market, especially when they have low qualifications. The OECD urged policymakers to improve the literacy and numeracy skills of young people who face an uphill task getting a job when each year employers are demanding better-trained staff. A renewed effort to develop apprenticeships tailored to the digital age would also help young people enter the workplace, it said. The OECD found that up to 20% of all youth experienced a period of inactivity or unemployment that lasted 12 months or more over a four-year period. Without improvements in schooling and access to further education colleges, periods out of the workforce may get longer, leading to \u201cdiscouragement and exclusion\u201d, it warned. \u201cIt is getting harder and harder for young people with low skills to find a job, let alone a steady job in today\u2019s workplace,\u201d said Stefano Scarpetta, the OECD\u2019s director of employment. \u201cUnless more is done to improve opportunities in education and training for everyone, there is a growing risk of an increasingly divided society.\u201d Combining work and education, through apprenticeships and other structured in-work learning, is widely recognised as one the main ways for young people with few formal qualifications to improve their employability. Looking back at the 2008 financial crash, the report said almost one in 10 jobs held by workers under 30 were destroyed in the aftermath. In Spain, Greece and Ireland, the number of employed youth halved between 2007 and 2014. Across the OECD, despite the recovery, the youth employment rate has stagnated since 2010 and today is still below pre-crisis levels. \u201cImproving the quality of vocational training and working more closely with employers to create apprenticeships is key. More countries should offer financial incentives to firms to create enough apprenticeship places, especially for the most disadvantaged youth,\u201d it said.",

      "bodyText": "Theresa May\u2019s government is facing a growing backlash over a proposal to force companies to disclose how many foreign workers they employ, with business leaders describing it as divisive and damaging. The proposal was revealed by Amber Rudd, the home secretary, at the Conservative party conference on Tuesday as a key plank of a government drive to reduce net migration and encourage businesses to hire British staff. However, senior figures in the business world warned the plan would be a \u201ccomplete anathema\u201d to responsible employers and would damage the UK economy because foreign workers were hired to fill gaps in skills that British staff could not provide. One chief executive of a FTSE 100 company, whose workforce includes thousands of EU citizens, said it was \u201cbizarre\u201d. The proposals, which are subject to consultation, have also been questioned from within the Conservative party. Lord Finkelstein, the Tory peer, told the BBC it was a \u201cmisstep\u201d, while Tory MP Neil Carmichael, chairman of the House of Commons education select committee, said the policy was \u201cunsettling\u201d and would \u201cdrive people, business and compassion out of British society and should not be pursued any further\u201d. Jeremy Corbyn, the Labour leader, said: \u201cConservative party leaders have sunk to a new low this week as they fan the flames of xenophobia and hatred in our communities and try to blame foreigners for their own failures. \u201cDrawing up lists of foreign workers won\u2019t stop unscrupulous employers undercutting wages in Britain. Shutting the door to international students won\u2019t pay young people\u2019s tuition fee debts, and ditching doctors from abroad won\u2019t cut NHS waiting lists.\u201d Rudd was forced to defend the proposals on Wednesday, insisting they were not xenophobic and that she had been careful about the language used. The home secretary told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme that some companies were \u201cgetting away\u201d with not training British workers and \u201cwe should be able to have a conversation about what skills we want to have in the UK\u201d. Rudd said that forcing companies to reveal their foreign workforce was \u201cnot something we are definitely going to do\u201d and was part of a wider review of immigration and employment practices. But a Home Office source said Rudd was not backing away from the proposal and it would be put out for consultation despite the backlash from businesses. Adam Marshall, the director general of the British Chambers of Commerce, said that having a global workforce should not be seen as a \u201cbadge of shame\u201d. He added: \u201cMost companies do their utmost to train their workers, engage with local schools and colleges, and look for local hires before going to the overseas market \u2013 which is often an expensive and bureaucratic step. \u201cBusinesses shouldn\u2019t be penalised or questioned for recruiting from overseas when they have specific skills needs. Many would be very concerned if their specific circumstances were boiled down to percentages, or used to suggest that they\u2019re somehow not doing their bit here at home.\u201d Manufacturers warned that foreign workers should not be regarded as a \u201csimple statistic\u201d. Tim Thomas, the director of employment and skills policy at the EEF, the manufacturers\u2019 organisation, said: \u201cThe concept of businesses reporting the number of workers who are not UK nationals will be a complete anathema to all responsible employers. Ironically, at a time when the government says it wants to extend opportunity to all and promote inclusion, this proposal will be divisive and damaging to the UK\u2019s diverse and multicultural workforces. \u201cThe object, it seems, is to shame those employers with a proportion of non-UK workers above some hypothetic and arbitrary level. Workers, whether UK, EU or global contribute greatly to UK industry and should be welcomed and not regarded as a simple statistic.\u201d Small businesses could be turned into \u201cimmigration officers\u201d by the proposals, the Federation of Small Businesses said. Mike Cherry, the national chairman of the FSB, said: \u201cFundamentally, the UK has been a global magnet for talent and this must be considered by ministers. The ability to hire the right people for the right job is paramount, and we will be championing this in the upcoming consultation. \u201cWe also do not want to see small business owners turned into immigration officers nor encumbered by new bureaucracy.\u201d The Institute of Directors said businesses focused on the skills of workers rather than their nationality. Seamus Nevin, head of employment and skills policy at the IoD, said: \u201cThis is a concerning proposal from the government. The notion that employers prefer foreign workers to UK-born is wrong. Employers don\u2019t discriminate by nationality \u2013 all that matters is the talent available. \u201cImmigrants are not like-for-like substitutes. They fill skills gap that cannot be filled domestically. Therefore it is hard to understand what government expects this \u2018naming and shaming\u2019 policy will achieve.\u201d Bosses in the technology industry warned that the plans could jeopardise the fledgling sector in Britain. Russ Shaw, founder of Tech London Advocates, said: \u201cThis reactionary call to restrict access to global talent goes against everything we are doing to build a global tech hub that rivals Silicon Valley. One out of every three UK tech employees was born overseas, and their hard work and commitment has played an essential role in making London the capital of European tech.\u201d Trade union leaders also criticised the government\u2019s \u201canti-immigrant sentiment\u201d at the party conference in Birmingham. Kamaljeet Jandu, GMB national equalities officer, said: \u201cThe UK government must not get swept away on a raft of anti-immigrant sentiment while looking for new scapegoats for their economic mistakes. Instead, it must focus on actually improving the lives of working people in this country after Brexit.\u201d",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The International Monetary Fund has urged governments to take action to tackle a record $152tn debt mountain before it triggers a fresh global financial and economic crisis. Warning that debt levels were not just high but rising, the IMF said it was vital to intervene early in order to mitigate the risks of a repeat of the damaging events that began with the collapse of the US sub-prime housing bubble almost a decade ago. It said that new research in its half-yearly fiscal monitor covering 113 countries had shown that debt was currently 225% of global GDP, with the private sector responsible for two-thirds of the total. Vitor Gaspar, the director of the IMF\u2019s fiscal affairs department said: \u201c$152tn is a record high. In places around the world we have excessive debt. In some places we have debt, in particular non-financial corporations\u2019 debt, growing very fast. \u201cA crucial message from the fiscal monitor is that when private debt is on an unsustainable path it is important to intervene early on in the process to make sure financial crises and recessions can be prevented.\u201d The IMF says fiscal policy, the power governments have over tax and spending, could help. It suggests government-led programmes to restructure debt and tax breaks to persuade creditors to lengthen repayment periods. Central banks have borne the brunt of attempts to boost growth for the past eight years, but the IMF said more active use of fiscal policy would provide a better mix. Excessive private debt was making global recovery more difficult and had increased the risk of financial instability. Rapid rises in private debt often led to financial-sector triggered recessions which were longer and deeper than normal downturns. Gaspar said debt was unevenly spread and concentrated in the advanced countries of the west and some of the big emerging market economies such as China. He advised countries where it posed a risk to financial stability to be proactive and intervene early. The IMF\u2019s report shows that the overall debt level has not fallen since the financial crisis and recession of 2007-09, despite the fact that the most severe downturn of the post-war era was the consequence of too much reckless borrowing. Debt levels were high at the end of the second world war, but decades of strong growth and moderate inflation led to a steady decline in debt to GDP ratios. Gaspar said that the reason debt levels were now higher than they were before the 2007-09 crisis was that economic growth had been so weak. Faster US expansion since the crisis had resulted in a much sharper decline in private indebtedness than in the eurozone, he added. Some countries, including the UK, have seen a decline in non-financial private sector debt since the world economy fell into recession in 2008. But the IMF expressed concern about the rapid growth of China\u2019s private sector debt to GDP ratio, up 70 percentage points between 2008 and 2015. \u201cChina is so large and the debt of non-financial corporations is growing so fast that it is having significant effects on global trends,\u201d Gaspar said.",

      "bodyText": "Deutsche Bank needs a convincing business case to attract investors, senior officials from the International Monetary Fund have said amid fears Germany\u2019s biggest bank will need to raise funds to avoid being crippled by a $14bn (\u00a310.5bn) penalty from the US for a decade-old scandal. The officials from the IMF \u2013 which has described Deutsche as the world\u2019s riskiest bank \u2013 also denied suggestions that European banks were facing tougher punishments from the US authorities than domestic ones. Peter Dattels, IMF deputy director, said Deutsche was being monitored by both the German and European authorities to ensure it remained resilient. Deutsche\u2019s shares dropped to 30-year lows last week amid fears any settlement with the US Department of Justice for mis-selling residential mortgage backed securities between 2005 and 2007 would drain its financial resources. John Cryan, chief executive of Deutsche, will be in Washington for the annual meeting of the IMF this week. Many speculate he could negotiate the cost. News agency AFP has reported that the settlement will be $5.4bn and Deutsche has made clear it has no intention to paying the $14bn suggested by the DoJ. Dattels described three sorts of problem banks: those with a legacy of non-performing loans, those that that had been recapitalised and restructured but were still struggling, and investment banks moving away from a business model based on huge balance sheets. \u201cDeutsche Bank is in the third bucket. It needs to continue to adjust to convince markets that its business model is viable and it is dealing with operational risks resulting from litigation. I\u2019m sure these challenges will be met.\u201d Matthew Jones, IMF assistant director for monetary and capital markets department, said fines were because misconduct had been identified and to \u201ccreate a culture of responsible finance\u201d. \u201cA number of decisions have been taken against institutions which have affected their share price because of the effects on profitability. If you look at the magnitude of the fines in the US it is not the case that non-US institutions have suffered more. US institutions have suffered more fines relative to other countries.\u201d Although Deutsche has not yet announced any settlement with the DoJ, its shares have risen from below \u20ac10 to above \u20ac12 on Wednesday. Analysts at Berenberg said it seemed inevitable Deutsche would need fresh funds. But they questioned whether the bank had an attractive investment case for investors. \u201cA capital raising seems inevitable, but core profitability is weak and it is unclear what return investors could earn on any new capital. Exposed to an industry in structural decline, it is hard to see Deutsche delivering a [return on equity] above 5% and is one of many banks to avoid,\u201d Berenberg analysts said. Cryan is in the early stages of a five-year turnaround programme which includes selling off businesses, cutting workforce and reducing the risks the bank takes. The Briton who has been running Deutsche for 15 months last week reassured staff that the bank met all its regulatory capital requirements and blamed \u201cforces in the market\u201d for trying to destabilise the bank.",

      "bodyText": "Back to Greece where tensions are mounting over home repossessions with clashes erupting between indebted home owners and riot police outside a court in Thessaloniki this afternoon. Helena Smith reports: Anger over the incendiary issue of home repossessions intensified as clashes broke out while a court in the northern metropolis convened over the issue. Judges were forced to adjourn the hearing as protestors, who have formed a citizens group called Collectives Against Auctions, rioted with police reinforcements sent to guard the building. Last week, the same group managed to stop a similar hearing over the foreclosure of a home belonging to a man who had defaulted on a \u20ac300,000 bank loan after storming the court room. The man, a father- of-six, who also owed \u20ac80,000 to the social security fund, claimed he had been unable to meet loan repayments after his business went bust and he had suffered a heart attack that had left him almost wholly incapacitated. Home repossessions are widely seen as a tipping point for Greeks at the sharp end of the biting austerity that has been the price of the debt-stricken country\u2019s rescue from insolvency. But within the 19-member eurozone Greece is also the champion in non-performing loans with the International Monetary Fund estimating that of the \u20ac900bn worth of bad loans in the area around \u20ac100bn belong to the portfolios of Greek banks. By contrast the Greek economy accounts for a mere 1.5 per cent of the eurozone. The IMF and the EU, which have poured over \u20ac300bn in bailout funds into the country since mid 2010, are now pressuring the government to relax protection laws against home foreclosures. In the months ahead the wave of repossessions is expected to grow amid escalating concerns that the issue is assuming explosive proportions. Indicatively Michalis Sallas, the long-serving chairman of Piraeus Bank until resigning in July, recently warned: \u201cCitizens cannot live with the fear of expulsion and repossession. It is to nobody\u2019s benefit, not even the banks. Who will insure [properties], who will look after them, who will pay property tax?\u201d The Greek real estate market \u2013 with the exception of that on popular Greek islands \u2013 is among the worst performing worldwide, with properties in Athens having lost up to 70 percent of their value since the crisis began. On that note, it\u2019s time to close for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. A mild recovery in the pound after better than expected UK service sector numbers saw the FTSE 100 drift back after Tuesday\u2019s - failed - attempt at a new record. Meanwhile talk that the European Central Bank might begin tapering its bond buying programme took the wind out of European markets, with most ending lower. But strong US services data lifted Wall Street, albeit also prompting renewed talk of US rate rises this year. The final scores in Europe showed: The FTSE 100 finished down 41.09 points or 0.58% at 7033.25 Germany\u2019s Dax dipped 0.32% to 10,585.78 France\u2019s Cac closed 0.29% lower at 4489.95 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB added 1.03% to 16,476.58 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended up 0.11% at 8778.3 In Greece, the Athens market slipped 0.66% to 575.37 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 129 points or 0.71%. As for the pound, it is up 0.17% at $1.2748 against the dollar and 0.19% higher at \u20ac1.1378. After Tuesday\u2019s attempt at a new peak, the FTSE 100 continues to flounder as the day wears on. Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at IG, said: Today has seen a reversal of yesterday\u2019s action, when the FTSE 100 soared (at least in the morning) as others fell back. Now, we have Wall Street advancing, and European markets paring losses, while the FTSE 100 languishes towards the bottom end of the day\u2019s range. Having been such a boon in recent days, the pound has perhaps hindered the index today, although sterling has recovered only a fraction of the ground lost since the beginning of the week... The US ISM non-manufacturing index hit a level not seen since November 2015, further boosting the cause of those expecting a Fed rate hike this year. US markets seemed happy to rally on the news, making up for the losses suffered yesterday. 2140 has held yet again for the S&amp;P 500, putting the index in a good position to challenge the all-time highs once again. A bounce in oil prices undoubtedly helped, after stockpiles dropped once again. Back with the IMF, and in a new report it says global debt has hit a new record. Jill Treanor reports: Global debt levels have reached a record $152tn (\u00a3119tn) according to the International Monetary Fund \u2013 more than double the size of the global economy at 225% of annual global output. The Washington-based fund said that two-thirds of the debt \u2013 approximately $100tn is held by the private sector, or companies and households. The IMF warns that debt \u201ccan carry great risks [at] excessive levels\u201d. The Fund\u2019s report shows that the overall debt level has not decreased since the the financial crisis and recession of 2007-09, despite the fact that the most severe downturn of the post-war era was the consequence of too much reckless borrowing. The IMF says that debt as a proportion of GDP has never been higher. The full story is here: And here is analysis from our economics editor Larry Elliott, who says governments must heed the ticking debt timebomb: Oil prices are moving even higher after a surprise decrease in US crude stocks. Brent crude is currently up 2% at $51.93 while West Texas Intermediate has jumped 2.3% to $49.84. Elsewhere the International Monetary Fund has weighed in on Deutsche Bank, saying it was one of the banks which needed to convince investors its business model was viable in a low interest rate environment. The bank\u2019s shares have fallen sharply on concerns about its balance sheet and the consequences of a possible $14bn fine by the US Department of Justice. At the IMF meeting in Washington, the fund\u2019s monetary and capital markets deputy director Peter Dattels said (quotes from Reuters): Deutsche Bank... is among banks that need to continue to adjust to convince investors that its business model is viable going forward and has addressed the issues of operational risk arising from litigation. He said the German authorities were closely monitoring Deutsche Bank\u2019s health and that the European financial system remained resilient. And the non-farms? But which should investors look at most, the Markit or ISM figures? Despite these strong service sector figures Dennis de Jong, managing director at UFX.com, believes a US rate rise before December is unlikely: After slipping to a six-year low in August, the news that September\u2019s ISM non-manufacturing PMI has rebounded strongly will be welcomed by Fed Chair Janet Yellen. The US economy has been sending out mixed signals in recent months, and the uncertainty has not been helped by the speculation swirling around a long-anticipated interest rate hike. Today\u2019s positive figures make the case for a rate rise stronger but, as we enter the final weeks of the presidential race, the general consensus is that it is unlikely we will see any movement before December. But the surveys could be an indicator for Friday\u2019s jobs figures: Anthony Nieves, chair of the ISM\u2019s non-manufacturing survey committee, said: The comments from the respondents are mostly positive about business conditions and the overall economy. A degree of uncertainty does exist due to geopolitical conditions coupled with the upcoming U.S. presidential election. And here are some of the comments highlighted by the ISM: \u201cSomewhat flat month of overall pricing conditions; however, labor cost and availability remains a concern.\u201d (Accommodation &amp; Food Services) \u201cBusiness is showing a moderate unexpected uptick over last month. YTD business volume is moderately under forecast.\u201d (Management of Companies &amp; Support Services) \u201cMacroeconomic issues like Brexit and reduced travel from South America impact summer travel.\u201d (Arts, Entertainment &amp; Recreation) \u201cSales ahead of plan. Net income below plan. Costs running higher than plan. In addition, continued low interest rates impact investment results.\u201d (Finance &amp; Insurance) \u201cAffordable Care Act, changes in Medicare and Medicaid causing problems across much of the healthcare and insurance industries. Acquisition helping our company, but also lost a large client that will impact our financials for the next year.\u201d (Health Care &amp; Social Assistance) \u201cSolid steady growth.\u201d (Professional, Scientific &amp; Technical Services) \u201cBusiness is [at] an annual high.\u201d (Public Administration) \u201cSales continue [at an] increased pace from last month.\u201d (Retail Trade) \u201cWe are watching the effects of the Hanjin Shipping issues with regard to cost and availability of Asian imports.\u201d (Wholesale Trade) The Institute for Supply Management service sector survey is also positive, even more so in fact. Its non-manufacturing PMI came in at 57.1 in September, showing a strong rebound from 51.4 in August and well above estimates of a figure of 53. This is the highest level since October 2015 and the biggest rise in the index since February 2011. The first of the US service sector surveys shows a better than expected performance in September. The Markit services final purchasing managers\u2019 index came in at 52.3 compared to an initial reading of 51.9 and a figure of 51 in August. This is the highest level since April. Markit\u2019s final composite PMI figure for September was 52.3, up from the first reading of 52 and August\u2019s 51.5. With oil prices continuing to rise - West Texas Intermediate is up 1.9% at $49.63 a barrel - US markets are heading higher. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 99 points or 0.5% while the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq Composite both opened around 0.3% higher. The ADP report still shows a strong jobs market, said Mark Zandi, chief economist of co-complier Moody\u2019s Analytics: The current record of consecutive monthly job gains continued in September. With job openings at all-time highs and layoffs near all-time lows, the job market remains in full-swing. Job growth has moderated in recent months, but only because the economy is finally returning to full-employment. But Ahu Yildirmaz, vice president and head of the ADP Research Institute, said: Job gains in September eased a bit when compared to the past 12-month average. We also observed softening this month in trade/transportation/utilities, possibly due to a continued tightening U.S. labor market and lackluster consumer spending. Ahead of more key US data - services surveys later and the non-farm payrolls on Friday - came the monthly private sector jobs figures, and they have proved disappointing. According to payrolls processor ADP, US private employers added 154,000 jobs in September, below the 166,000 figure expected by economists. This was the smallest increase since April. August\u2019s number was revised down from a 177,000 increase to 175,000. But previewing the ADP numbers Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets, suggested they were no real guide to the non-farm numbers: In the US the warm up act for Friday\u2019s non-farm payrolls report is the ADP Payrolls report for September. Sadly this report has given little indication in recent months of being any sort of bellwether to its bigger brother, being remarkably stable in and around the 175k level for the last 4 months [before September]. Utility shares have been weak all day on reports that Theresa May might hit out at the charges the companies make on consumers, and sure enough she said: Where companies are exploiting the failures of the market in which they operate, where consumer choice is inhibited by deliberately complex pricing structures, we must set the market right... It\u2019s just not right that two thirds of energy customers are stuck on the most expensive tariffs. So SSE is down 1.5%, National Grid is nearly 2% lower and water companies United Utilities, Severn Trent and Pennon are down between 2% and 3% (although a downbeat note from RBC Capital is not helping the last three). By attacking ultra-loose monetary policy, Theresa May might actually have put a floor under the pound. Sterling is still hovering around $1.272, up from this morning\u2019s 31-year lows. Investors may have concluded that it\u2019s a little harder for the Bank of England to ease monetary policy again in November. Especially when the economic data is still better than feared. Kathleen Brooks, research director at City Index, explains: May certainly doesn\u2019t mince her words, and since she spoke we have seen a slight uptick in the pound versus both the dollar and the euro. The FTSE 100 is also off of its lows of the day, although it still remains comfortably above 7,000. This may seem counter-intuitive, but ultra low interest rates are not great for the banking sector, so May\u2019s words could boost this sector and thus the pound and the FTSE 100 at the same time. Of course, the BOE is independent, so May\u2019s government should not be able to change policy. But her words could be enough to ease some of the downward pressure that has been building on the pound and could be enough to trigger a mini rally, potentially back above 1.28 in GBP/USD. Theresa May\u2019s speech, and her criticism of the Bank of England\u2019s monetary policy, has gone down rather badly with that beacon of free market ideology, the Adam Smith Institute. Director Sam Bowman sounds like a man whose eyebrows got a thorough workout during the PM\u2019s speech, saying: [There isn\u2019t] any evidence that clamping down on EU immigration will help British workers, but we will have to borrow more if immigration falls because they pay in more than they cost. Or that quantitative easing has made us worse off \u2013 the evidence suggests that without it the post-crisis recession would have been deeper and longer. \u201cMrs May\u2019s speech was the opposite of pragmatic. We call on the Prime Minister to abandon her ideological attachment to interventionist economic policies, look at the evidence, and accept that it tells us that markets, not the state, are the solution to our problems.\u201d Newsflash: The International Monetary Fund has warned that pension funds and insurance groups could be wiped out by the current era of ultra-low interest rates. From Washington, our economics editor Larry Elliott reports: Insurance companies and pension funds are at risk of becoming insolvent if ultra-low interest rates persist for a prolonged period, the International Monetary Fund has warned. After almost eight years in which central banks have kept borrowing costs at record lows in an attempt to boost growth, the IMF said an over-reliance on monetary policy could have unwanted side-effects. It used its half-yearly health check of the global financial system to advise that the calmer-than-expected conditions since the Brexit vote might not last. While short-term risks had abated over the past six months, the IMF said big challenges remained \u2013 including the impact of record-low interest rates on pension funds and insurance companies, the fragility of banks, rapid credit growth in China and the heavy indebtedness of the corporate sector in emerging countries. \u201cThe solvency of many life insurance companies and pension funds is threatened by a prolonged period of low interest rates,\u201d the IMF said in its global financial stability report (GFSR). Here\u2019s Larry\u2019s piece: This makes Theresa May\u2019s intervention on monetary policy even more intriguing.... Theresa May will have pleased many older Brits by attacking the Bank of England\u2019s stimulus programme. She\u2019s absolutely right that QE has driven up assets prices; the whole idea is that central banks mop up \u2018safe\u2019 assets such as government bonds, and encourage investors to move money into risky things. Great if you own a house, a trust fund or a Canaletto... less good if you\u2019re relying on the income from savings. But.... central banks have been driven into ever-deeper stimulus efforts by the failure of the global economy to bounce back from the 2008 crisis. And governments must take some blame. In the UK, George Osborne\u2019s austerity budgets relied heavily on the Bank of England propping up demand with record low interest rates. European central bankers have been dropping heavy hints for months that fiscal policy needs to do more work, and that they\u2019re running short of ammo. Perhaps May has got the message..... Wowzers.... Theresa May has just fired a broadside at the Bank of England over its stimulus programme. She\u2019s addressing the Tory faithful in Birmingham now, and (in between outlining her Brexit vision and promising a clampdown on tax dodgers), she blasted the era of ultra-low interest rates and bond-buying. May declared: While monetary policy with super low rates and quantitative easing have provided emergency medicine, we have to acknowledge some of the bad side effects. People with assets have got richer, while people without have not\u2026 A change has got to come, and we are going to deliver it because that\u2019s what a Conservative government can do. That sounds like a serious intervention into monetary policy, frankly, aimed at governor Mark Carney (who, as a Canadian, may already be concerned about the Tory\u2019s attacks on firms who hire foreign workers) Our Politics Liveblog has all the details: Over in Greece, air traffic control workers have called a strike in protest at proposals to reform their industry. The shake-up is part of the country\u2019s bailout programme, and due to be debated by MPs later this week. Reuters has the details: Greek air traffic controllers plan to walk off the job over four days from October 9th, grounding flights in protest at changes to their job descriptions under reforms pursued by the country\u2019s foreign creditors. Their union said on Wednesday they would stage 24-hour strikes on October 9th and 10th, and October 12th-13th inclusive. All but emergency and search-and-rescue flights along with flights through the Athens Flight Information region would be suspended. Walkouts by Greek air traffic controllers, a department considered an essential service, have in the past been deemed illegal by Greek courts and been cancelled. The announcement on industrial action coincided with the submission of draft legislation to parliament on Tuesday evening seeking to introduce changes to the structure of the civil aviation department. So any Brits who can still afford to fly to Greece following the pound\u2019s tumble may have a problem (unless the courts step in...). How low could the pound go, as Britain rattles towards triggering article 50 next March (or earlier). Koon How Heng, a senior foreign-exchange strategist at Credit Suisse, believes sterling could easily hit $1.25, or lower... He told CNBC that he still has \u201ca very negative view on sterling\u201d. \u201cOfficially, our forecast for sterling dollar is at 1.25. \u201cWe would think it\u2019s going to head lower. It\u2019s probably going to go down the tubes.\u201d There\u2019s a subdued feeling on City trading floor today, after the FTSE 100 failed (just) to hit a new alltime high yesterday. The blue-chip index has shed almost 0.6%, or 40 points, to 7034 - despite Tesco soaring higher after impressing investors with its financial results today. And the smaller FTSE 250, which did hit a record high last night, has lost 0.7%. European stock markets are also in the red, today, following reports that the European Central Bank might wind back its bond-buying stimulus programme. Currently, the ECB is creating \u20ac80bn of new money each month to buy new bonds. Bloomberg says that policymakers have considered tapering it -- steadily trimming the monthly purchases. Although the ECB denies discussing tapering, the prospect of the easy money tap being turned down has depressed the markets. Joshua Mahony, market analyst at IG, explains: The bullish sentiment that drove yesterday\u2019s sensational rise in the FTSE has been dampened today, with markets largely responding to the fears that perhaps the seemingly unlimited ECB QE could be limited after all. Rumours of exit plans being drawn up at the ECB highlight the growing feeling that Draghi &amp; co are facing up to a exhaustion of monetary policy policies and effectiveness. Bank of England deputy governor Ben Broadbent has weighed in on the Brexit issue, saying June\u2019s vote has caused rather less economic damage than feared. In a speech this morning, Broadbent says: There\u2019s little doubt that the economy has performed better than surveys suggested immediately after the referendum and, although we aimed off those significantly, somewhat more strongly than our near-term forecasts as well. Why? Broadbent suggests the UK economy had more \u2018underlying momentum than expected\u2019. Second, the housing market may hold be better than feared. And there\u2019s also the possibility that the weak pound is supporting the economy. Broadbent says: The foreign exchange market attempts to price long-run risk and, to my mind, the currency fell after the referendum for fear of what the result might ultimately mean for the UK\u2019s access to global markets. But if that is a risk for the longer term, once the UK\u2019s new trading arrangements come into force, those arrangements are for the time being unchanged. Against that backdrop, the fall in the exchange rate will help to support activity, cushioning the impact of greater uncertainty. While that was expected, the effect could be coming through faster than we\u2019d anticipated. The speech also takes a good look at the impact, and causes, of record low bond yields (a massive headache for pension funds), and the wider issue of economic uncertainty. It\u2019s online here. This isn\u2019t how Theresa May would like her first conference as Tory leader to be remembered. But it appears that the slump in the pound vs the euro this week means Britain has fallen to sixth place in the list of the world\u2019s biggest economies, behind our old friends France. The FT\u2019s Chris Giles has crunched the numbers, and explains: International Monetary Fund estimates of the size of economies in 2016 puts the UK at \u00a31,932bn with France weighing in at \u20ac2,228bn, putting the UK ahead so long as a pound buys more than \u20ac1.153. At the start of the week, the prime minister, chancellor, foreign secretary and Brexit secretary all boasted that Britain would get a good deal in EU talks because Britain was the fifth-largest economy in the world. At that stage their words could be justified with sterling worth \u20ac1.16 at the end of last week. The paradox of the tough talk \u2014 with suggestions that Britain will leave the single market and clamp down heavily on immigration \u2014 has been to pull the rug from under sterling, leaving it at a post-Brexit low of \u20ac1.14 on Wednesday and below the point at which it is the fifth-largest economy. The pound is currently hovering around \u20ac1.134, having hit a five-year low this morning. The encouraging service sector PMI has given the poor old pound a bit of relief. Sterling has now struggled back from its early morning selloff, and is now back around $1.2740 against the US dollar. We\u2019ve now had three months worth of PMI data, since the UK referendum. And they suggest that the economy did deteriorate in July, before bouncing back in August and September. David Noble, CEO at the Chartered Institute of Procurement &amp; Supply, is also encouraged by September\u2019s service sector report. Policymakers were offered much-needed positive news for September after the recent Brexit upheaval, as the service sector reported the fastest increase in new business since February this year. Though the overall activity index still remained below its long-term average and had dipped slightly compared to August, it reflected a modest revival of fortunes for services businesses. But although firms took on more workers in September, \u201cdisquiet\u201d around Brexit still remains, Noble says: The sector concentrated on stabilising rather than forging ahead with confidence, as optimism stayed below the long- term average.\u201d Fears that Britain could be falling into recession have faded, following today\u2019s service sector data. Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit, believes the UK has regained \u201cmodest growth momentum\u201d \u201cAcross the three sectors [Services, Construction and Manufacturing] the pace of economic growth signalled was the strongest since January, fuelling greater job creation as companies shrugged off short-term Brexit worries and enjoyed the benefits of a weaker currency. \u201cThe improvement suggests the economy has regained a growth rate of approximately 0.3% after recovering from the initial shock of the EU referendum in late-June. If July\u2019s low is included, the PMI surveys point to a mere 0.1% expansion of GDP in the third quarter, but this probably overstates the weakening in the rate of growth. Breaking: Britain\u2019s services sector grew faster than expected last month, as firms shake off the shock of June\u2019s Eu referendum. The Service Sector PMI, produced by data firm Markit, has come in at 52.6. That shows slightly slower growth than August (52.9), but comfortably ahead of estimates. Markit reports that: Activity rises but growth rate eases slightly New business grows at fastest rate since February Largest input cost rise since February 2013 Service sector firms reported that new business rose at the fastest pace since February, as customer enquiries picked up and confidence recovered. There was also \u201crising demand from overseas clients\u201d linked to the weak pound. However, there are also worries that the slump in sterling is driving up import costs. Markit says: The UK service sector continued to recover from July\u2019s EU referendum-induced shock, However, future expectations remained very low by historical standards and the survey recorded the sharpest increase in service sector input prices in over three-and-a-half years. More to follow.... Britain\u2019s car industry seems to have ridden out the Brexit storm, so far anyway. New car registrations in the UK rose 1.6% in September to hit a new record, according to new data from the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders. But SMMT chief executive Mike Hawes warns that the industry could yet be damaged: \u201cThe ability of the market to maintain this record level of demand will depend on the ability of government to overcome political uncertainty and safeguard the conditions that underpin consumer appetite\u201d How bad would a \u2018Hard Brexit\u2019 be? Well, according to a new report, 70,000 financial services jobs could be lost if the UK leaves the single market. Up to \u00a310bn of tax revenue could be wiped out too -- if British firms lost the ability to sell services across the European single market. The key is whether Britain retains its \u2018passporting\u2019 rights, which currently allow City firms to operate in every EU country without separate licences or offices on the ground. The report, by consultancy group Oliver Wyman for TheCityUK lobby group, says that Britain would only suffer a \u2018modest reduction\u2019 in activity, if it retained access to the single market. In this scenario, revenues are predicted to decline by up to \u00a32BN (2% of total wholesale and international business), 4,000 jobs would be at risk, and tax revenues would fall by less than \u00a30.5BN per annum. However, losing access to the single market would be much more serious ... Under conditions where the UK moves to a third country arrangement with the EU, without any regulatory equivalence and its relationship with the EU is defined by terms set out under the World Trade Organization, up to 50% of EU-related activity (\u00a320BN in revenue) and an estimated 35,000 jobs could be at risk, along with \u00a35BN of tax revenues per annum. When taking into consideration the knock-on impact to the whole financial services ecosystem \u2013 the possibility of shifting of entire business units, or the closure of lines of business due to increased costs it could almost double the effect of Brexit. The Conservatives are promising a hard line on immigration -- so it\u2019s hard to see how they can restrict the movement of people into the UK, while retaining the movement of capital out of it... Just in: growth in the eurozone\u2019s private sector slowed in September, suggesting Europe\u2019s economy may have hit a soft patch. The monthly Eurozone Service sector PMI, from Markit, has dropped to 52.2, from 52.8 in August. That shows the slowest growth in activity since December 2014. And the wider \u2018composite\u2019 measure, including manufacturing, shows growth slowed to its weakest since January 2015. Growth picked up in France (hurrah!), but dipped in Germany, Ireland and Spain (boo) It\u2019s fairly unusual for a party conference to move the currency markets. But there\u2019s no doubt that the news from the Conservative\u2019s meet-up in Birmingham this week has weakened the pound. Jeremy Cook of World First, the currency trading firm, says: It\u2019s another day and another set of fresh post-Brexit lows for sterling against the majority of its trade partners. Trade weighted sterling has been lower than it is now \u2013 following the UK\u2019s withdrawal from the ERM in the early 90s and as the Global Financial Crisis hit in 2008 \u2013 but Britain\u2019s exporters must be praying that this Conservative Party Conference lasts another 6 weeks. Has Tesco turned the corner? Shares in the supermarket chain have jumped by 8% this morning, after its latest financial results. Investors are cheering a chunk rise in operating profits (but not in pre-tax levels), from \u00a3372m to \u00a3515m, and sales growth across the business. On the downside, the pension deficit has more than doubled this year.... Britain\u2019s currency has effectively been devalued by 15% against major rivals since June 23rd. Some analysts are predicting the pound could suffer further shunts downwards, as the EU exit negotiations begin in earnest. In today\u2019s Financial Times, Koon Chow, macro and forex strategist at UBP, says: \u201cThe pound\u2019s drop is likely to be a series of spaced out depreciations, with the trigger for weakness being each piece of new information on the economic sacrifice that the UK government is willing to take on the path to Brexit.\u201d London\u2019s stock market has also dropped in early trading, even through a weak pound is good for some companies. The FTSE 100 index, which nearly hit a record high yesterday, has dropped by 18 points to 7056. And the UK-focused FTSE 250 has also dipped by around 0.2% Sterling is continuing its \u201cslippery decline\u201d this week as ongoing Brexit uncertainties haunt investor attraction towards the currency. So says FXTM research analyst Lukman Otunuga, who reckons investors aren\u2019t taking comfort from recent solid economic data. Brexit jitters may be bone deep consequently ensuring the Sterling remains depressed until the article 50 invoke date. Although sentiment towards the UK economy continues to be uplifted as domestic data repeatedly beats, the persistent uncertainty and unknowns over how the Brexit negotiations will take place have seriously soured investor appetite towards the Sterling. This chart shows how sterling has hit new 31-year lows this morning, below $1.27. The pound has now lost almost three cents against the US dollar this week (and it\u2019s only Wednesday morning). Theresa May knocked the wind out of sterling on Sunday, when she announced she\u2019d trigger article 50 in March 2017, raising the chances of a hard break from the EU. Fears over Britain\u2019s looming exit from the European Union are hitting the pound again this morning. Sterling has slipped to a fresh 31-year low against the US dollar, falling below $1.27 for the first time since 1985. The pound is currently changing hands at $1.26932, down 0.25% today, extending yesterday\u2019s selloff. Sterling has also slid to a new five-year low against the euro in the last few minutes. It\u2019s now worth just \u20ac1.1321, meaning one euro is worth 88.3p. So what\u2019s happening? Simply put, the pound is being rattled by worries about a \u2018hard Brexit\u2019. That could see UK firms lose access to the single market as the government priorities control over immigration. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Two down, one to go. After solid data from Britain\u2019s manufacturing and construction sector this week, it\u2019s time to find out how the services sector performed in September. Markit\u2019s services report, released at 9.30am, is expected to show steady growth. Economists expect the PMI to come in at 52.1, down from 52.9 in August. That would show another month of solid growth, despite the shock of the Brexit vote in June. And given that the manufacturing and construction PMIs both beat forecasts this week, perhaps services will do to. Analysts at RBC Capital Markets suspect we MAY learn that Britain\u2019s economy is growing faster than thought. The September Markit/CIPS services PMI for the UK is due this morning. So far both the manufacturing and construction sector PMIs have surprised very clearly to the upside. A repeat in the services sector would reinforce the upside risks to our Q3 GDP growth forecast of -0.1% q/q which materialised after last week\u2019s strong news on output in the service sector in July. The eurozone\u2019s service sector gets its own healthcheck too, at 9am. Also coming up today... The International Monetary Fund will release its Global Financial Stability Report at 1.45pm BST, highlighting the main dangers to the world economy. The Eurozone sovereign debt markets could be lively, following a report that the European Central Bank has been considering whether to \u2018taper\u2019 its bond-buying stimulus programme. Supermarket chain Tesco is reporting results this morning; profits are down by a quarter, but like-for-like sales are up 0.6% in the last six months. And Ben Broadbent, deputy governor of the Bank of England, is giving a speech at 9.30am in London. We\u2019ll be tracking all the main events through the day...",

Helena Smith reports: </p> <blockquote> <p>Anger over the incendiary issue of home repossessions intensified as clashes broke out while a court in the northern metropolis convened over the issue. Judges were forced to adjourn the hearing as protestors, who have formed a citizens group called Collectives Against Auctions, rioted with police reinforcements sent to guard the building. Last week, the same group managed to stop a similar hearing over the foreclosure of a home belonging to a man who had defaulted on a \u20ac300,000 bank loan after storming the court room. The man, a father- of-six, who also owed \u20ac80,000 to the social security fund, claimed he had been unable to meet loan repayments after his business went bust and he had suffered a heart attack that had left him almost wholly incapacitated.</p> <p>Home repossessions are widely seen as a tipping point for Greeks at the sharp end of the biting austerity that has been the price of the debt-stricken country\u2019s rescue from insolvency. </p> <p>But within the 19-member eurozone Greece is also the champion in non-performing loans with the International Monetary Fund estimating that of the \u20ac900bn worth of bad loans in the area around \u20ac100bn belong to the portfolios of Greek banks. By contrast the Greek economy accounts for a mere 1.5 per cent of the eurozone. The IMF and the EU, which have poured over \u20ac300bn in bailout funds into the country since mid 2010, are now pressuring the government to relax protection laws against home foreclosures. In the months ahead the wave of repossessions is expected to grow amid escalating concerns that the issue is assuming explosive proportions. Indicatively Michalis Sallas, the long-serving chairman of Piraeus Bank until resigning in July, recently warned: \u201cCitizens cannot live with the fear of expulsion and repossession. It is to nobody\u2019s benefit, not even the banks. Who will insure [properties], who will look after them, who will pay property tax?\u201d </p> <p>The Greek real estate market \u2013 with the exception of that on popular Greek islands \u2013 is among the worst performing worldwide, with properties in Athens having lost up to 70 percent of their value since the crisis began. </p> </blockquote> <p><em>On that note, it\u2019s time to close for the evening.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Workers in more than 30 US cities are planning to join a lunchtime protest at their local McDonald\u2019s stores on Thursday to draw attention to 15 different sexual complaints that have been filed against the company and its franchisees over the past month. The allegations, filed with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), claimed that in addition to experiencing sexual harassment on the job those who complained were often retaliated against. Complaints were filed in eight states: California, Michigan, Wisconsin, North Carolina, Illinois, Missouri, Florida, New York. Fourteen of the complaints filed detail harassment occurring in franchise stores. While just one complaint is about harassment that took place in a corporate McDonald\u2019s store, all complaints name the company as joint employer. It is up to EEOC to determine whether McDonald\u2019s is jointly responsible for the harassment that occurs at its franchise stores. One of the 15 complaints was filed by Kristi Maisenbach, who used to work at McDonald\u2019s in Folsom, California. In her complaint, she alleged that her supervisor \u201cgrabbed [her] breasts on several occasions and would intentionally rub his genitals against [her] butt\u201d and sent her a text message offering $1,000 for oral sex. After Maisenbach complained to her general manager, she said her hours were reduced and she eventually quit to look for another job. Cycei Monae, a former McDonald\u2019s worker from Flint, Michigan, also filed a complaint alleging that her supervisor rubbed his genitals against her, complimented her body and said he wanted to \u201cdo things\u201d to her. Monae said that she reported the behavior to her store manager as well as McDonald\u2019s corporate office. \u201cMcDonald\u2019s monitors everything we do \u2013 from how fast the drive-thru is moving, to how we fold our customers\u2019 bags. Yet when I filed a complaint against my shift manager for regularly sexually harassing me \u2013 which included him showing me a photo of his genitals \u2013 McDonald\u2019s had no response,\u201d said Monae. Monae said that she quit because of the incessant harassment. \u201cI really needed that job and the money, and I considered remaining silent. But I believed McDonald\u2019s had my back and would be horrified by the way I was treated. I was wrong,\u201d she said. Protesters are calling for McDonald\u2019s to enforce its zero-tolerance sexual harassment policy. \u201cMcDonald\u2019s has zero tolerance for any form of sexual harassment of any employee,\u201d according to the McDonald\u2019s operations and training manual. \u201cSexual harassment is prohibited because it may be intimidating, an abuse of power and is inconsistent with McDonald\u2019s policies and management philosophy.\u201d In a statement provided to the Guardian, McDonald\u2019s spokeswoman Terri Hickey said: \u201cAt McDonald\u2019s, we and our independent owner-operators share a deep commitment to the respectful treatment of everyone. There is no place for harassment and discrimination of any kind in McDonald\u2019s restaurants or in any workplace. We take any concerns seriously and are reviewing the allegations.\u201d The workers plan to carry signs that read \u201cMcDonald\u2019s, Hands Off My Buns\u201d and \u201cMcDonald\u2019s, Put Some Respect in My Check\u201d. The protests are being organized by the Fight for $15 movement, which has been pushing for a $15 minimum wage and the right to unionize for all workers. According to the movement, the complaints filed were made by Fight for $15 activists. \u201cI think it\u2019s worth noting here that if these workers had a union that the process and the outcome would be a lot different,\u201d said Kendall Fells, organizing director at Fight for $15.\u201d If someone sent you a message offering you a $1,000 for oral sex, you would actually have a way on the job to handle that.\u201d This is not the first time that McDonald\u2019s has been named in sexual harassment complaints filed with the EEOC. In 2008, a Colorado-based owner of 25 McDonald\u2019s franchise stores settled an EEOC lawsuit for $505,000. That lawsuit alleged that employees, who were 15 to 17 years old, were subject to sexual harassment that included supervisors biting their breasts, grabbing their rears, making sexual comments and offering favors in exchange for sex. In 2010 McDonald\u2019s itself settled an EEOC sexual harassment suit that alleged that a teenager was hugged, spanked and touched by his supervisor in a way that made him uncomfortable. That case, filed in New Jersey, was settled for $50,000. In 2012, another Milwaukee-based owner of 25 McDonald\u2019s franchise stores called Missoula Mac agreed to pay $1m to settle a similar complaint. In this case, female employees alleged that their male co-workers made sexual comments, touched them inappropriately and forced their hands on to the men\u2019s private parts. From the time that the EEOC filed a lawsuit in 2011 to when it was settled in 2012, Missoula Mac went from operating 42 stores to operating 25. Some of the female employees in this lawsuit were also teenagers. Last year, the EEOC received 6,822 sexual harassment complaints \u2013 almost 83% of which were filed by female employees. A 2011 analysis of EEOC data found that almost 37% of EEOC sexual harassment complaints were filed by women in the restaurant industry.",

Complaints were filed in eight states: California, Michigan, Wisconsin, North Carolina, Illinois, Missouri, Florida, New York. Fourteen of the complaints filed detail harassment occurring in franchise stores. While just one complaint is about harassment that took place in a corporate McDonald\u2019s store, all complaints name the company as joint employer. It is up to EEOC to determine whether McDonald\u2019s is jointly responsible for the harassment that occurs at its franchise stores. </p> <p>One of the 15 complaints was filed by Kristi Maisenbach, who used to work at McDonald\u2019s in Folsom, California. In her complaint, she alleged that her supervisor<strong> </strong>\u201cgrabbed [her] breasts on several occasions and would intentionally rub his genitals against [her] butt\u201d and sent her a text message offering $1,000 for oral sex. After Maisenbach complained to her general manager, she said her hours were reduced and she eventually quit to look for another job.</p> <p>Cycei Monae, a former McDonald\u2019s worker from Flint, Michigan, also filed a complaint alleging that her supervisor rubbed his genitals against her, complimented her body and said he wanted to \u201cdo things\u201d to her. Monae said that she reported the behavior to her store manager as well as McDonald\u2019s corporate office. </p> <p> \u201cMcDonald\u2019s monitors everything we do \u2013 from how fast the drive-thru is moving, to how we fold our customers\u2019 bags. Yet when I filed a complaint against my shift manager for regularly sexually harassing me \u2013 which included him showing me a photo of his genitals \u2013 McDonald\u2019s had no response,\u201d said Monae. </p> <p>Monae said that she quit because of the incessant harassment. </p> <p>\u201cI really needed that job and the money, and I considered remaining silent. But I believed McDonald\u2019s had my back and would be horrified by the way I was treated.

      "bodyText": "Boardroom bosses should meet employees every year to justify pay practices, according to proposals put forward by one the City\u2019s biggest fund managers as it warned that wage inequality needs to be addressed by major companies. But Legal &amp; General Investment Management (LGIM) \u2013 which last month called for ratios between the chief executive and that of median employee to be published \u2013 fell short of supporting the call by Theresa May to put workers on boards. The prime minister has raised the prospect of putting employees on company boards, and making shareholder votes on executive pay legally binding. \u201cEmployee representatives should play a role by meeting with the remuneration committee annually to ask why the committee considers the pay practices applied in the organisation to be fair,\u201d said the senior corporate governance manager at LGIM in a research paper. Angeli Benham said: \u201cCompanies should not forget that workers are their most valuable asset and success would not be delivered without their effort. Companies that are exercising restraint, cutting costs and headcount should be sensitive if they are also increasing executive pay. \u201cAll employees, regardless of the health of the company, should be recognised for their contribution to the success of business.\u201d Citing research by the High Pay Centre showing pay for FTSE 100 bosses increased 146% from 2000 to 2013 compared with 43% for all employees of FTSE 100 firms, she said inequality \u201chas a material impact on society. This inequality, and the furore that surrounds executive pay, can no longer be ignored.\u201d \u201cHigh pay does not always guarantee performance. Total pay for executive directors, particularly chief executives, has increased sharply over the past decade. When compared to the performance of the market, the increasing level of executive pay is becoming difficult to justify,\u201d Benham said. In a letter to firms last month, LGIM not only called for disclosure on pay ratios but also for a cap on directors\u2019 bonuses, so they were no bigger than two times salary. The move appeared to grasp the recommendations of a high-level executive working group, which published its findings in July. That group \u2013 in which the L&amp;G chief executive, Nigel Wilson, played a key role \u2013 rejected May\u2019s ideas for a binding vote on pay deals and did not set out how much directors should be paid. While May has highlighted a focus on corporate governance, companies are also being subjected to scrutiny by the business, innovation and skills (BIS) select committee, chaired by MP Iain Wright, which is also embarking on a study of executive pay. Shareholders have an advisory vote on annual pay deals and one on three-year pay policies, which is binding. This year\u2019s annual general meeting season kicked off to an explosive start when shareholders voted down pay deals at BP and Smith &amp; Nephew, the medical equipment group. LGIM wants companies to reduce the focus on annual bonuses and target long-term pay. Benham also highlighted pensions and called for the disparity between contributions for executives (about 25%) and employees (about 5-10%) to be reduced. \u201cFair pay for employees is good for business and the economy. Employees on lower incomes spend a larger proportion of their pay than others. Data from the British Retail Consortium shows that household consumption accounts for about 60% of GDP in the UK. Ensuring employees are adequately and fairly remunerated also promotes better worker productivity and retention,\u201d she said. Sacha Sadan, director of corporate governance at LGIM, urged rival fund managers to vote at annual meetings and not show their displeasure at boardroom practices by abstaining. He said votes against the chair of the remuneration committee could be particularly effective. Pay levels might also start to decline if companies move away from long-term incentive plans \u2013 awards of shares paid out over three or five years that are linked to performance targets \u2013 and handed out \u201crestricted\u201d shares instead. These shares are not tied to performance but must be held by directors for up to five years. LGIM is calling for these share awards to be 50% of the value of those contained in long-term incentive plans. However, with share prices currently rising, directors being paid in shares could be enjoying higher pay.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "TalkTalk has been hit with a record \u00a3400,000 fine for the security failings that led to the company being hacked in October 2015. The Information Commissioner\u2019s Office levied the fine saying that the attack \u201ccould have been prevented if TalkTalk had taken basic steps to protect customers\u2019 information\u201d. The hack resulted in the attacker accessing the personal information of more than 150,000 customers of the internet service provider, including sensitive financial data for more than 15,000 people. The information commissioner, Elizabeth Denham, said: \u201cTalkTalk\u2019s failure to implement the most basic cyber security measures allowed hackers to penetrate TalkTalk\u2019s systems with ease. \u201cYes, hacking is wrong, but that is not an excuse for companies to abdicate their security obligations. TalkTalk should and could have done more to safeguard its customer information. It did not and we have taken action.\u201d The technique used by the attacker, called SQL injection, has been well known in security circles for almost 20 years. \u201cSQL injection is well understood, defences exist and TalkTalk ought to have known it posed a risk to its data,\u201d the ICO said. \u201cOn top of that the company also had two early warnings that it was unaware of. The first was a successful SQL injection attack on 17 July 2015 that exploited the same vulnerability in the webpages. A second attack was launched between 2 and 3 September 2015.\u201d The amount the ICO can fine companies for serious breach of data protection obligations is capped at \u00a3500,000, leaving TalkTalk\u2019s fine almost as large as it could possibly receive. Repeat offenders can also be issued \u201cenforcement notices\u201d under the same legislation, which entail the ICO requiring a business to take particular steps to prevent a re-occurrence. The previous highest fine ever issued by the ICO was \u00a3350,000, against Prodial, a spam-calling company responsible for over 46 million automated nuisance calls. In a statement, TalkTalk said: \u201cTalkTalk has co-operated fully with the ICO at all times and, while this is clearly a disappointing decision, we continue to be respectful of the important role the ICO plays in upholding the privacy of consumers. \u201cDuring a year in which the government data showed nine in 10 large UK businesses were successfully breached, the TalkTalk attack was notable for our decision to be open and honest with our customers from the outset. This gave them the best chance of protecting themselves and we remain firm that this was the right approach for them and for our business. \u201cAs the case remains the subject of an ongoing criminal prosecution, we cannot comment further at this time.\u201d In September this year, Daniel Kelley, 19, was charged with hacking the company. Kelley appeared at Westminster magistrates court accused of demanding 465 bitcoins, then worth over \u00a3200,000, from the company after allegedly carrying out the attack. Data was taken from an underlying customer database that was part of TalkTalk\u2019s acquisition of Tiscali\u2019s UK operations in 2009, the ICO said. It added that the data was accessed through an attack on three vulnerable webpages in the \u201cinherited infrastructure\u201d. TalkTalk was said to have failed to properly scan this infrastructure for possible threats and was unaware the vulnerable pages existed or that they enabled access to a database that held customer information. TalkTalk was not aware that the installed version of the database software was outdated and no longer supported by the provider, according to the ICO.

TalkTalk should and could have done more to safeguard its customer information. It did not and we have taken action.\u201d</p> <p>The technique used by the attacker, called SQL injection, has been well known in security circles for almost 20 years. \u201cSQL injection is well understood, defences exist and TalkTalk ought to have known it posed a risk to its data,\u201d the ICO said. \u201cOn top of that the company also had two early warnings that it was unaware of. The first was a successful SQL injection attack on 17 July 2015 that exploited the same vulnerability in the webpages. A second attack was launched between 2 and 3 September 2015.\u201d</p> <p>The amount the ICO can fine companies for serious breach of data protection obligations is capped at \u00a3500,000, leaving TalkTalk\u2019s fine almost as large as it could possibly receive. Repeat offenders can also be issued \u201cenforcement notices\u201d under the same legislation, which entail the ICO requiring a business to take particular steps to prevent a re-occurrence.</p> <p>The previous highest fine ever issued by the ICO was \u00a3350,000, <a href=\"https://ico.org.uk/action-weve-taken/enforcement/prodial-ltd/\">against Prodial</a>, a spam-calling company responsible for over 46 million automated nuisance calls.</p> <p>In a statement, TalkTalk said: \u201cTalkTalk has co-operated fully with the ICO at all times and, while this is clearly a disappointing decision, we continue to be respectful of the important role the ICO plays in upholding the privacy of consumers.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>\u201cDuring a year in which the government data showed nine in 10 large UK businesses were successfully breached, the TalkTalk attack was notable for our decision to be open and honest with our customers from the outset. This gave them the best chance of protecting themselves and we remain firm that this was the right approach for them and for our business.</p> <p>\u201cAs the case remains the subject of an ongoing criminal prosecution, we cannot comment further at this time.\u201d</p> <p>In September this year, Daniel Kelley, 19, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/sep/27/teenager-accused-of-talktalk-cyber-attack\">was charged with hacking the company</a>. Kelley appeared at Westminster magistrates court accused of demanding 465 bitcoins, then worth over \u00a3200,000, from the company after allegedly carrying out the attack.</p> <p>Data was taken from an underlying customer database that was part of TalkTalk\u2019s acquisition of Tiscali\u2019s UK operations in 2009, the ICO said. It added that the data was accessed through an attack on three vulnerable webpages in the \u201cinherited infrastructure\u201d. </p> <p>TalkTalk was said to have failed to properly scan this infrastructure for possible threats and was unaware the vulnerable pages existed or that they enabled access to a database that held customer information. </p> <p>TalkTalk was not aware that the installed version of the database software was outdated and no longer supported by the provider, according to the ICO. The company said it did not know at the time that the software was affected by a bug \u2013 for which a fix was available, the watchdog said, adding: \u201cThe bug allowed the attacker to bypass access restrictions.

      "bodyText": "Britain\u2019s car industry enjoyed a record September for new vehicle sales, but said Brexit uncertainty could weigh on future demand. The new 66 plate helped to lift new car sales by a modest 1.6% last month compared with a year earlier to a total of 469,696, according to the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT). It was the highest number on record for September, typically a strong month for sales because of the plate change. Howard Archer, the chief UK economist at IHS Global Insight, described the 1.6% rise as \u201cdecent if unspectacular\u201d. \u201cStrong year-on-year growth in car sales are becoming ever harder to achieve as they are coming from a high base following extended healthy gains,\u201d Archer said. \u201cThere is also the possibility that September\u2019s modest growth rate in car sales could be a sign that consumers are becoming more cautious about making major purchases such as a car due to heightened uncertainty following June\u2019s Brexit vote.\u201d A 7.3% increase in fleet sales was behind the rise in September, while sales to private buyers fell 1.7%. The top three best sellers were the Ford Fiesta, Vauxhall Corsa and Volkswagen Golf. Mike Hawes, chief executive of the SMMT, said, the 66 plate, new models featuring the latest technology and cheap financing deals had all helped to boost demand in September. He said, however, that the future strength of the UK car market was at risk because of the uncertainty posed by the Brexit vote. \u201cBusiness and consumers place September orders many months in advance, so the ability of the market to maintain this record level of demand will depend on the ability of government to overcome political uncertainty and safeguard the conditions that underpin consumer appetite,\u201d Hawes said. The expectation is that the sharp drop in the pound since the Brexit vote will start to weigh on consumers over the coming months. Inflation is expected to rise and companies are expected to limit wage growth as they seek to keep their costs down. \u201cThere is a very real likelihood that inflation will move above earnings growth during 2017,\u201d Archer said. In the first nine months of 2016, 2.15m new cars were sold. That was 2.6% more than at the same point in 2015, and only the second time that the 2 million cars have been sold by September since 2004.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Insurance companies and pension funds are at risk of becoming insolvent if ultra-low interest rates persist for a prolonged period, the International Monetary Fund has warned. After almost eight years in which central banks have kept borrowing costs at record lows in an attempt to boost growth, the IMF said an over-reliance on monetary policy could have unwanted side-effects. It used its half-yearly health check of the global financial system to advise that the calmer-than-expected conditions since the Brexit vote might not last. While short-term risks had abated over the past six months, the IMF said big challenges remained \u2013 including the impact of record-low interest rates on pension funds and insurance companies, the fragility of banks, rapid credit growth in China and the heavy indebtedness of the corporate sector in emerging countries. \u201cThe solvency of many life insurance companies and pension funds is threatened by a prolonged period of low interest rates,\u201d the IMF said in its global financial stability report (GFSR). \u201cLow interest rates add to the legacy challenges facing many insurance companies and pension funds, along with those from ageing populations and low or volatile asset returns. Heightened concern over these important long-term saving and investment institutions could encourage even greater saving, adding to financial and economic stagnation pressures.\u201d The GFSR said regulators and supervisors needed to take prompt action to sustain the strength of insurance company and pension fund balance sheets, including identifying risks of insolvency and funding gaps. \u201cMany pension funds face funding gaps, where the present value of future liabilities exceeds the market value of their assets,\u201d the IMF said. Poor profitability continued to blight Europe\u2019s banks, the GFSR said, noting that a third would remain weak even if growth accelerated from the low levels recorded since the financial crisis and recession of 2007-09. For the west as a whole, 25% of banks with assets of $11.7tn (\u00a39.21tn) would remain in poor shape after a cyclical recovery. Since the start of the year, the market capitalisation of western banks had fallen by almost $430bn, strengthening the case for tackling vulnerabilities. \u201cMore deep-rooted reforms and systemic management are needed, especially for European banks,\u201d the IMF said. It said the number of bank branches in Europe should be reduced, while stronger measures were needed to tackle the high level of non-performing loans. Together, the two changes would add a net $180bn to the capital position of Europe\u2019s banks, allowing them better to support growth. The GFSR said the shock of Brexit had initially led to turbulence in financial markets, but they had subsequently shrugged off concerns about the risks to the UK from leaving the EU. But it said the medium-term outlook was less rosy, with a need to look beyond monetary stimulus from central banks towards a stronger mix of policies to strengthen the foundations of the global position. The GFSR said this could help avoid financial stagnation and protectionism, which would reduce global growth by around three percentage points over the next five years. Low interest rates raised the present value of existing long-term liabilities, steadily eroding capital and solvency buffers the longer the low-rate environment persists. \u201cA protracted period of low and negative policy rates and yields could undermine financial resilience in the medium term, but the risks of increased headwinds may materialise more immediately,\u201d the IMF said, adding that falling share prices were likely to put pressure on banks to curtail lending until early 2018. \u201cIn many European countries, a more complete solution to address legacy bank problems can no longer be postponed. Specifically, both the high level of nonperforming loans and rising strains on profitability require urgent and comprehensive action.\u201d The IMF identified Italy and Portugal as particularly vulnerable. While fears of a market meltdown after the Brexit vote had not materialised, there was a risk of the City losing business as a result of the decision to leave the EU, according to the report. \u201cThe post-referendum bout of market volatility faded after central banks responded promptly; no major disorderly market events surfaced, other than a sharp sell-off in some UK-based real estate funds,\u201d the GFSR said. \u201cYet the biggest challenges remain ahead. The shape of future trade arrangements and the uncertain impact of Brexit on the United Kingdom\u2019s large and globally integrated financial system have created uncertainty over the longer-term financial prospects of the United Kingdom. There is a high degree of uncertainty surrounding future arrangements and the implications for the UK financial sector.\u201d",

The GFSR said this could help avoid financial stagnation and protectionism, which would reduce global growth by around three percentage points over the next five years.</p> <p>Low interest rates raised the present value of existing long-term liabilities, steadily eroding capital and solvency buffers the longer the low-rate environment persists.<br></p> <p>\u201cA protracted period of low and negative policy rates and yields could undermine financial resilience in the medium term, but the risks of increased headwinds may materialise more immediately,\u201d the IMF said, adding that falling share prices were likely to put pressure on banks to curtail lending until early 2018.</p> <p>\u201cIn many European countries, a more complete solution to address legacy bank problems can no longer be postponed. Specifically, both the high level of nonperforming loans and rising strains on profitability require urgent and comprehensive action.\u201d The IMF identified Italy and Portugal as particularly vulnerable. </p> <p>While fears of a market meltdown after the Brexit vote had not materialised, there was a risk of the City losing business as a result of the decision to leave the EU, according to the report.</p> <p>\u201cThe post-referendum bout of market volatility faded after central banks responded promptly; no major disorderly market events surfaced, other than a sharp sell-off in some UK-based real estate funds,\u201d the GFSR said.<br></p> <p>\u201cYet the biggest challenges remain ahead. The shape of future trade arrangements and the uncertain impact of Brexit on the United Kingdom\u2019s large and globally integrated financial system have created uncertainty over the longer-term financial prospects of the United Kingdom. There is a high degree of uncertainty surrounding future arrangements and the implications for the UK financial sector.\u201d <br></p>",

But that slowing looks so far to have been more moderate than we feared.\u201d But the deputy governor cautioned against reading too much into individual pieces of data following the UK\u2019s decision to leave the EU. He said that while consumer spending would be \u201crelatively unperturbed\u201d, the greater risk would be a hit to business investment, as companies hold off on big spending commitments because of heightened uncertainty. \u201cA lack of clarity about the UK\u2019s future trading relationships needn\u2019t result in visible, headline-grabbing closures of productive capacity. The effect is likely to be more insidious: decisions to expand, that might otherwise have been taken, are delayed.\u201d Last week the Japanese carmaker Nissan said it could scrap a potential new investment at its Sunderland factory unless the UK government pledged to compensate it for any tariffs imposed after Brexit. Broadbent said a combination of factors had probably helped the UK economy in the aftermath of the Brexit vote, including strong domestic demand and a weaker pound. He defended the Bank against the accusation that its policy of ultra low interest rates was driving up pension deficits. In August the Bank announced measures to support the economy following the Brexit vote. Interest rates were cut to an all-time low of 0.25%, and the Bank increased its asset purchasing programme \u2013 quantitative easing \u2013 by \u00a360bn to \u00a3435bn. Broadbent suggested that while looser monetary policy did play a part in rising deficits \u2013 because lower bond yields increase pension liabilities \u2013 the key driver was the economic backdrop. \u201cThe decline in policy rates is a symptom not a cause of the forces shaping the global economy,\u201d Broadbent said. \u201cThe main thing to understand is that, even if domestic monetary policy has some bearing on real interest rates, at least for a while, it is not their ultimate determinant.\u201d He said that while looser monetary policy tended to drive bond yields lower, historically it also tended to increase the value of assets, benefiting pension funds. \u201cBut over the past decade or so, equities and bonds have been negatively correlated. More to the point, the general tendency has been for bonds to do well \u2013 for yields to decline \u2013 and equities poorly. \u201cIt\u2019s this outperformance of the safe asset, highly unusual over such a sustained period, that has been the main problem for defined benefit [pension] schemes.\u201d",

Cash machine fees rose for the 10th consecutive time this year, reaching a record average of $4.57, according to Bankrate. Withdrawing money from an out-of-network ATM usually results in two different fees \u2013 one from your bank and one from the bank that owns the ATM. Both of these fees have reached a new high this year. This year, banks charged non-customers an average of $2.90 to withdraw their money \u2013 up from $2.88 last year. This is the 12th consecutive year this fee has gone up. The average fee imposed by banks on their customers for using an ATM that does not belong to the bank also went up to $1.67 from $1.64 a year ago. It is the 10th year that the two fees combined have risen. In 1998, banks charged on average $0.89 for non-customer withdrawals and $1.08 for withdrawals made on out-of-network ATMs, meaning that since 1998, ATM fees have gone up by almost 132%. The increase has not gone unnoticed. \u201cIn my view, it is unacceptable that Americans are paying a $4 or $5 fee each time they go to the ATM,\u201d Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont said earlier this year when he was still running for US president.

      "bodyText": "Leading shares are edging lower after failing to hit a new peak at the last gasp on Tuesday. A drop in precious metal miners as the market closed has continued in the latest trading session. The companies came under pressure as gold dropped sharply along with a rising dollar, and although the metal has regained some ground, miners are among the main fallers in the index. Fresnillo has fallen 46p to \u00a316.78 while Randgold Resources is down 165p to \u00a371.65. Overall the FTSE 100 has dipped 18.05 points to 7056.29, despite the pound slipping to a new 31 year low against the dollar and a better than expected UK services survey for September. To add to investors\u2019 existing concerns - a hard Brexit leaving the UK outside the single market, a potential rise in US interest rates, worries about bank balance sheets - came talk that the European Central Bank may start tapering its bond buying programme. Rebecca O\u2019Keeffe, head of investment at stockbroker Interactive Investor, said: European equity markets are on the back foot as concerns grow that central banks are going to pare back accommodative policy - with the ECB potentially tapering bond purchases and previously dovish Fed members ramping up expectations of an interest rate rise this year. Both equity and bond market valuations have been founded on monetary support from global central banks and have arguably become hooked on quantitative easing and low interest rates.

      "bodyText": "A pick-up in sales at supermarket giant Tesco has been overshadowed by the \u00a35.9bn hole that has opened up in its pension fund. Tesco said that since February its pension deficit had ballooned from \u00a33.2bn to \u00a35.9bn due to the collapse in bond yields after Britain voted to leave the European Union. Its finance director Alan Stewart said it did not have to increase its contributions to the scheme but pensions experts suggested the problem could hinder the resumption of dividend payments to investors. The grocer\u2019s shares jumped nearly 10% after chief executive Dave Lewis told the City that sales at UK stores had risen 0.9% in the three months to the end of August \u2013 the retailer\u2019s third quarter of growth in a row. \u201cThese results indicate a business moving out of crisis to one that\u2019s showing real confidence in its recovery,\u201d he said, pointing to like-for-like sales growth across the group. Pre-tax profits for the six months to the end of August were down 28% at \u00a371m but underlying earnings, excluding one-off items, jumped by 60% to \u00a3596m. The retailer is expected to make full year profits of \u00a31.2bn. The shares closed up 18.4p at 207.1p. With the business now \u201cextremely stable\u201d Lewis said it was time to \u201cstep it up\u201d, setting out a three year plan to rebuild profits which collapsed to a \u00a36.4bn annual loss in 2015. He set a target that by 2020 it would earn between 3.5p and 4p of operating profit for every \u00a31 customers spend. The group currently makes 2.2p in the \u00a31. To get there, however, Lewis said the grocer would need to slash a further \u00a31.5bn from its cost by making its stores and distribution network more efficient. Lewis has already made savings of \u00a3500m but he insisted the new programme was not about cutting jobs in stores, where the number of staff serving customers has actually increased by 12,000 over the past two years. Instead, the former Unilever executive has axed thousands of head office and store management roles and while there would be some \u201ctrimming\u201d, this time, he said it was \u201cabout changing the way we do business\u201d. Tesco said about \u00a3550m of the savings would come from making its store operations efficient, looking at areas such as opening hours and re-stocking shelves during the day rather than at night. Surging pension deficits have been highlighted by other big British firms, including John Lewis, Primark owner ABF and the AA. Tesco\u2019s deficit calculation is based on an accounting measure but next year the scheme will undergo a triennial pension valuation, which Richard Farr, managing director at Lincoln Pensions, argues could lead to its trustees asking for more than the \u00a3270m per year they already receive to fund the scheme. \u201cIt is likely that just when Dave Lewis wants to recommence dividends that trustees will certainly want to increase their own demands,\u201d said Farr. Stewart said it was too early to talk about reinstating payments to shareholders with the last dividend paid in the second half of its 2014-15 financial year. Lewis joined Tesco two years ago and almost immediately was engulfed in the biggest crisis in the company\u2019s history when a whistleblower alerted him to an accounting scandal. Tesco suspended four executives when it discovered its profits had been artificially inflated, and the Serious Fraud Office (SFO) launched an investigation into the company. To revive sales Lewis focused on lower prices, improving customer service and making sure its shelves are full. He also revamped its budget ranges with a new range of own-label \u201cfarm\u201d brands to counter Aldi and Lidl. The shake up has seen lapsed customers return to its stores with even its more than 200 out-of-town hypermarkets, which Lewis\u2019s predecessor Philip Clarke stopped short of calling white elephants, enjoying better sales. Shore Capital analyst Clive Black said some \u201cunderstandable excitement\u201d had been generated by Lewis\u2019s new plan to boost profits but the company\u2019s \u00a318bn debt pile, which includes the pension deficit and \u00a37.7bn of store lease commitments, was an issue: \u201cThat progress is being made at the operating level is undeniable and commendable ... but you cannot ignore the company\u2019s level of indebtedness.\u201d",
