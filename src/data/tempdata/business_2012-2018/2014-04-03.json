      "bodyText": "Mario Draghi rejected the International Monetary Fund's call for immediate action to combat growing deflationary pressures as the European Central Bank adopted a wait-and-see approach to fresh measures to boost growth. Despite warnings from the fund and the Paris-based Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development of the risks to the eurozone's fragile recovery, the ECB president said it was still thinking about whether to embrace the unconventional approach to monetary policy used by the Bank of England, the US Federal Reserve and the Bank of Japan. A House of Lords committee has added its voice to those of the IMF and OECD , warning that it would be unwise to conclude that the storm had passed. The eurozone is in the early stages of a recovery from a triple-dip recession, but a report from the Lords economic and financial affairs committee warned that the pick-up was fragile. The euro fell on the foreign exchanges after Draghi said the ECB's ruling council had discussed how to implement quantitative easing (QE) \u2013 the purchase of financial assets to create money \u2013 after news this week that the annual inflation rate in the 18-nation eurozone had fallen to just 0.5%. Financial analysts said Draghi was playing for time and hoping to stimulate exports by \"talking down\" the euro. Draghi attacked the IMF's managing director, Christine Lagarde, after she made the case for immediate QE. \"The IMF has been of recent extremely generous in its suggestions on what we should do or not do, and we are really thankful for that,\" he said. \"Frankly, I would like the IMF to be as generous as they have been towards us also with other monetary policy jurisdictions, like for example issuing statements just the day before a [US Federal Reserve] meeting would take place.\" Despite speculation ahead of yesterday's meeting, the ECB left its key policy rate at 0.25% and declined to take steps that might increase the flow of credit to businesses and households. Concern among some on the ECB council about the threat of a prolonged period of Japanese-style deflation was highlighted by the admission that QE \u2013 once considered outside the bank's remit \u2013 was now on the table. \"All instruments that fall within the mandate, including QE, are intended to be part of this statement,\" Draghi said. He added that all members of the governing council were \"unanimous in its commitment to using all unconventional instruments within its mandate in order to cope effectively with risks of a too prolonged period of low inflation\". Trevor Greetham, of Fidelity, said: \"ECB president Mario Draghi says the governing council is open to 'unconventional ease' if necessary in order to avoid an overly long period of low inflation or to offset economic problems caused by currency strength or geopolitical risk [a nod to Putin]. \"This is more monetary policy on the cheap. The aim is to talk down the euro without actually doing anything.\" The OECD said the eurozone was returning to growth amid easing austerity and rising confidence but warned that the improvement remained fragile, with high unemployment and risks posed internally and from outside the currency bloc. \"The euro area economies, including those most heavily hit by the crisis, appear to be turning the corner after many years of low and uneven growth,\" it said in its latest economic survey of the region. The OECD said it was forecasting growth of 1% in 2014 and 1.6% in 2015, following a 0.4% fall in gross domestic product in 2013. It stressed that the eurozone's 11.9% jobless rate would not start to come down until next year. \"The risks to these projections have become more balanced but are still on the downside. Downside risks include the uncertain political situation, social tensions and still challenging public finances in many countries which mean that financial market turbulence could flare up again.\" In its report, the Lords committee said: \"It would be unwise to conclude that the storm has passed.\" It noted that fundamental weaknesses still existed, such as poor growth, huge differences in prosperity between member states, \"destructively high\" levels of unemployment and growing fears of a deflationary spiral. These weaknesses left the eurozone extremely vulnerable to future shocks.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Speculation was growing that Tesco's finance director, Laurie McIlwee, could quit in the coming days as the supermarket group battles shrinking sales and falling profitability. McIlwee, who has worked at Tesco for 15 years, has been under pressure for months as the grocer's financial performance has declined, and particularly after the shock 23% fall in half-year profits reported last autumn. The full-year numbers are due to be released on 16 April, and analysts at HSBC have this week cut their forecasts for earnings by 7% and for 2015 by 10%. Consensus forecasts for underlying profits show a fall to \u00a33bn from \u00a33.2bn \u2013 the second consecutive decline. Last year's fall was the first in a generation. In 2012 Tesco made \u00a33.8bn. McIlwee's departure could be announced before those figures, and would leave the chief executive, Phil Clarke, who was promoted to the top job in June 2010, as the only executive director on the board of the once-dominant supermarket. Tesco is not only losing market share, according to data from Kantar Worldpanel, but also sales as shoppers defect to low-cost rivals such as Aldi and Lidl. Tesco's market share \u2013 at 28.7% \u2013 is at its lowest in almost 10 years. At its peak the chain had a 31.8% of the \u00a3170bn UK grocery market. It is underperforming in each of the 13 countries in which it operates, and has been forced into a humiliating retreat from its Fresh &amp; Easy expansion into the US. It has also been forced to seek a joint venture partner in China. Clarke, whose own tenure in the top job is also being questioned, is trying to convince the City that he can accelerate his turnaround plan with more store refurbishments and \u00a3200m of price cuts focused on staple groceries. Last month he fuelled the speculation about his intentions, saying: \"You only have a job like this for a few years. I'm not a young man. I'm 54 \u2013 I've given it 40 years. \"My job is to carry on doing the job until I'm ready to hand on to someone \u2013 until I find somebody to take over.\" Clarke \u2013 the son of a Tesco store manager who has spent his entire career at Tesco \u2013 took over from Sir Terry Leahy whose retirement after 14 years signalled the beginning of the downturn in the retailer's fortunes and just as discount supermarkets were increasingly attracting cost-conscious shoppers. There is speculation that Clarke and McIlwee, who has been finance director for five years, have not seen eye-to-eye on some areas of the new strategy and City analysts regard the finance director as abrasive. Tesco refused to comment.",

      "bodyText": "National Grid made special payments of \u00a3300m over the last 12 months to big energy companies \u2013 sometimes for switching off their power stations in an attempt to \"balance\" the system. The huge payout dwarfs the \u00a337m paid to windfarms to remain offline over the same period to the end of February \u2013 a figure used by critics to question the advisability of supporting renewable energy. The numbers have come to light because the grid, which operates the transmission lines and pylons around the UK, has started to make them publicly available them for the first time. A spokesman for the National Grid said paying gas or wind companies not to operate might appear unusual but a range of often unforeseeable factors, such as plant breakdowns, weather patterns and other issues, made it vital to compensate them for regional asymmetries in supply and demand. \"Making these constraint payments is the most economic way of balancing the system, such as when power is needed in one part of the network but not in another,\" said a spokeswoman. The Renewable Energy Foundation, seen by critics as an anti-wind lobby group, has crunched the raw data from the grid on payments made to windfarms in March and say they reached \u00a38.7m. John Constable, the director of the Foundation, said he was relaxed about gas companies balancing the system but said wind constraint payments were \"rocketing up\" and were double the cost of subsidies paid when the turbines operated. \"They [windfarm operators] are abusing their power in the market,\" he claimed. The debate has hotted up amid revelations that David Cameron is considering whether to cut all financial aid to onshore windfarms in the runup to the elections. The grid's official figures for February indicate that constraint payments were below \u00a32m for wind in February but were worth just under \u00a320m to gas operators, which could include the big six suppliers. A spokesperson for the grid said there were going to be \"peaks and troughs\" in payments to all generators and pointed out that constraint payments had started before any wind turbines were built: \"These are not a consequence of wind.\" But the grid admitted that there were additional problems with wind because so many farms had been built so quickly, many in remote parts of the country, before the transmission infrastructure to handle their output was built. \"It is true that there are new wind farms coming on stream in Scotland that need extra [transmission] capacity to bring the power down to the south of England. A major increase will come when the western link [transmission line] is built but this will not open until 2016,\" said the spokeswoman.",

      "bodyText": "The chief executive of SSE, one of the big six energy providers, has urged the industry to move away from its confrontational stance and embrace all market reforms that benefit the customer. Alistair Phillips-Davies also called on the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) to undertake the widest possible investigation of all aspects of the sector in a bid to clear the air. \"As privatised utilities, we should always view with humility the regulatory, political and public scrutiny on our activities,\" he argued, adding: \"We all have to acknowledge that energy is not perfect and we have to look at reforms that benefit the customer.\" He went on: \"A market reference [investigation] should provide a platform for achieving greater political and regulatory stability for the Great Britain energy market, for the benefit of customers. It must therefore be broad enough.\" The peace overtures from Phillips-Davies, whose company also broke new ground recently by freezing its prices until 2016, contrast with the more aggressive comments in the past from his rivals. Sam Laidlaw, the head of Centrica, was quick to warn about the lights going out when the CMA probe was proposed, saying it would freeze investment in new power stations for another two years. Phillips-Davies was speaking at an event in London organised by the market research company YouGov and Cambridge University, under the banner of Energy, Politics and the Consumer. YouGov used the occasion to release a survey showing more than a quarter of the public strongly believed the big six energy companies failed to act in the best interest of consumers and society, while 67% believed the firms operated a cartel. The poll of 2,000 adults showed customer satisfaction with energy companies is lower than with banks, while over half of poll respondents said they had been forced to turn their heating down or off to keep soaring gas and electricity bills affordable. The damning results give more support to Ofgem and the CMA, which last week called for a full competition inquiry into the energy market after a period of rising profits and increasing customer dissatisfaction. Ed Davey, the secretary of state for energy and climate change, said the YouGov poll confirmed what he had been saying to the suppliers that \"this is a 'Fred the shred' moment\" for the energy industry. \"With the government's action to reduce bills on average by \u00a350, the energy companies have said there should be no prices rises this year unless there is a substantial spike in wholesale costs \u2013 and some have gone further by freezing prices for longer. \"And with the full blown competition inquiry proposed by Ofgem, the energy suppliers have a once in a generation opportunity to show people they get it, keep prices down, improve their service and regain people's trust.\" Caroline Flint, the shadow energy secretary, said the poll findings underlined why her party was right to demand an immediate price freeze, but expressed concerns that the probe by the CMA could last till 2016. She said there was little comfort for consumers \"because it leaves them in the bizarre position of being told that competition in this market is not working and the prices they pay are not fair, but that nothing will be done with it for two years.\" In a separate development, more than 100 MPs, academics and businessmen \u2013 including Ian Marchant, the former boss of SSE \u2013 have put their names to a document urging the European Commission to reject the state aid request from the British government that would enable the building of new reactors at Hinkley Point, Somerset. The signatories \u2013 co-ordinated by Paul Dorfman, senior research associate at the Energy Institute at University College, London \u2013 oppose the funding of the reactors for a variety of reasons, including cost and safety, but also for potentially distorting the market against wind and other renewable technologies. The document says: \"The development of sustainable and affordable low carbon energy remains a growing economic sector with huge potential for job creation. To seek to delimit this diversity through state aid support of nuclear power at the expense of other potentially more flexible, safe, productive, cost effective and affordable technologies seems, at the very least, unwise.\"",

The decline the third in as many months underlined concerns that consumer prices could start to fall outright, starting a so-called deflation.</p> <p>That risks creating a situation in which consumers and businesses put off purchases in hopes of better deals down the line and companies cut prices to entice buyers. Such a downward spiral chokes off economic growth and can be difficult to get out of Japan was stuck in deflation for two decades.</p> <p>The ECB has said the eurozone is experiencing a \"protracted period of low inflation\" but dismisses fears of an outright deflation.</p> <p>Unemployment, meanwhile, remains stuck near a record-high of around 12 percent following years of economic and financial upheaval. In the countries hardest-hit by the crisis like Greece and Spain, more than one in four people are still jobless.</p> <p>Besides having a social cost, high unemployment also weighs on consumption and the wider economy. The EU predicts the eurozone will grow 1.1 percent this year. While that would be the bloc's best performance since 2011, it would still pale in comparison to the U.S. economy, which is expected to grow around 3 percent.</p> <p>This week's new dip in inflation came at a time when the euro has been buoyant in foreign exchange markets. But a higher currency can push inflation further down in two ways: It can make imports cheaper and weigh on economic activity by making exports more expensive on international markets.</p> <p>The prospect of a looming deflation, meanwhile, is especially worrisome for those eurozone nations already unable to support growth because of their overly high debt burden. That's because when prices fall, it becomes harder to service debts, which are fixed in nominal terms.</p> <p>Among the possibilities the ECB might be considering in the near future, analysts say, might be large-scale purchases of financial assets such as government bonds with newly created money, as the U.S. Federal Reserve has done.</p> <p>That would increase the amount of money in the economy and aim to lower market interest rates and stoke inflation.

      "bodyText": "A reminder of the key points from today's European Central Bank press conference: The ECB's governing council has, for the first time, discussed the possibility of launching a quantitative-easing programme, buying assets with newly minted money in a bid to drive inflation higher. Speaking after the ECB left interest rates unchanged, president Mario Draghi said the council was \"unanimous\" in its commitment to using all unconventional instruments within its mandate, including QE. He said: \"All instruments that fall within the mandate, including QE, are intended to be part of this statement. There was, in fact, during the discussion we had today, there was a discussion of QE.\" Europe's central bank, though, appears some way from actually launching QE. Under questioning, Draghi said work needs to done to agree what a programme would look like. It is likely to be based on buying bank loans, rather than sovereign debt, and currently Europe lacks a functional market for asset-backed securities. A concerned-looking Draghi also admitted that his biggest fear, stagnation, is already a reality \"to some extent\". Draghi's dovish comments drove the euro lower, losing half a cent to $1.371. The ECB, though, remains optimistic that inflation will pick up in the months ahead. Draghi blamed last month's weak inflation reading (0.5%) on Easter falling late this year. Analysts believe the ECB is more likely to impose negative interest rates on banks, rather than grasp the QE nettle. Reaction starts here Credit Agricole's Frederik Ducrozet argued: What is getting clearer by the day is that the ECB is now intellectually ready to react to the risk of a \u2018lowflation\u2019 with radical, non-conventional action. Draghi also chided IMF chief Christine Lagarde for saying yesterday that the ECB should take further unconventional action. No-one believes he is actually \"really grateful\" for the advice.... In other news... Glasgow engineering firm Weir Group has warned that costs for Scottish firms are bound to rise, if the region votes for independence. Growth in Europe's service sector slowed last month, with firms slashing prices in an attempt to win orders. The UK's service sector also cooled, with growth hitting a nine-month low in March. The IMF has warned that interest rates will remain at low levels for an extended period... ...although Bank of England governor Mark Carney refused to promise not to raise UK rates before next May's election The BoE has also released a fresh treasure trove from its archives, including letters from prisoners convicted of forging notes I'll be back tomorrow. Cheers, and goodnight. GW There's good news on the jobs front in Ireland, as correspondent Henry McDonald reports: Twenty four hours after Irish unemployment rates dropped for the 21st month in a row there has been a fresh boost for jobs in Dublin and Shannon today. Three different firms have announced new posts being created in the Irish capital and county Clare. Ryanair announced today in the presence of Taoiseach Enda Kenny and Finance Minister Michael Noonan that it is created 200 new IT jobs to help the airline develop improved digital platforms including a new mobile app. Pharmaceutical company Alexion will create 200 jobs in Blanchardstown, Co Dublin over the next two years. It is part of a \u20ac75 million global investment with the company building a new packaging, office and warehouse facility in Blanchardstown west Dublin. And It is expected that an extra 200 construction jobs will be created as a result of the expansion. Meanwhile Pepper Asset Servicing plans to create 100 positions over the next 12 months, with recruitment already under way for 50 jobs in Shannon. Over on the FT website, Gavin Davies reminds us how the ECB's approach to QE has evolved since Europe's financial crisis began: A few years ago it tended to dismiss the option on the grounds that it was too close to direct financing of government budget deficits, and was therefore against the terms of the euro treaties. More recently, while becoming gradually less dismissive of QE on constitutional grounds, it has been unwilling to concede that unconventional monetary easing was necessary, saying that conventional measures were still available, and would be used first. Then, in the last few press conferences, Mr Draghi has hinted that QE would probably be within the ECB\u2019s mandate after all, but there were doubts about whether this would be acceptable to the Bundesbank. There was also a clear indication at that stage that unconventional policies would be used only as a means of combating a serious risk of outright deflation, something that Mr Draghi said was most unlikely. Quite a journey to today, with the governing council now 'unanimous' that QE is one of the unconventional measures it could use. Most of Europe's stock markets have posted gains today, as Mario Draghi's dovish performance in Frankfurt raised hopes of further stimulus to get euro inflation rising off the mat. In London, though, shares finished a little lower, after service sector data from the US came in slightly below expectations (details here) FTSE 100: down 9 points at 6649, -0.15% German DAX: up 5 points at 9628, +-0.06% French CAC: up 18 points at 4449, +0.4% Spanish IBEX: up 148 points at 10,581, +1.4% Italian FTSE MIB: up 300 points at 21,992, +1.4% IG's Chris Beauchamp explains: Fleeting gains and losses have been the order of the day in London, with the mining sector acting as a dead weight on the FTSE 100. \u2018Buy the rumour, sell the fact\u2019 was back in operation after several days of talk surrounding Chinese stimulus. When the actual news arrived, the reaction was one of studied disappointment, and we\u2019re seeing the sector broadly in the red as the day continues. Some disappointment over a lack of action by the ECB has set in as well, and we\u2019ve seen the broader index drop back below 6650 as the first sustained period of weakness for around a week sets in. Kingfisher\u2019s rise to new all-time highs today is further good news for patient investors, but there has been something for the momentum crowd as Just Eat enjoys 8% gains on its first day trading. Just don\u2019t mention that the company is worth 112 times earnings. City traders are taking a cautious approach ahead of tomorrow's US jobs data, which could show a big jump in employment after several weak readings. Some economists expect a 200,000 increase in the \"Non-Farm Payroll': Eimear Daly, head of market analysis at Monex Europe, says Mario Draghi managed to \"dupe\" the markets into reacting as if the ECB had actually announced new policy-easing measures. An impressive sleight of hand that eased the Euro and pulled money market rates lower. Draghi stated the Governing Council was 'unanimous in its commitment' to using unconventional measures to tackle prolonged low inflation, and dangled various alternative policy options in front of the market. Although he maintained that deflation risks have not increased and that low inflation was chiefly due to external factors, Draghi is growing concerned that the Eurozone will be stuck in a vicious circle, where the longer inflation stays low, the more belief in deflation will grow. Despite the heightened rhetoric around alternative policies from the ECB, these will remain nothing more than discussions. Money supply growth is recovering after being temporarily suppressed at the turn of the year and low inflation remains the result of exogenous global factors and not a deflation problem in the Eurozone itself.\" Frederik Ducrozet of Credit Agricole shows how the ECB's forecasts for inflation, released just a month ago, are already at risk following March's weak CPI reading of just 0.5%. He reckons that the ECB is steadily building a case for asset purchases to drive inflation higher, if it deems it necessary. True, we are left with a great deal of confusion as to which market exactly could be targeted, under which conditions, and when. Regulatory constraints are significant, yet not insurmountable, as we argued. What is getting clearer by the day is that the ECB is now intellectually ready to react to the risk of a \u2018lowflation\u2019 with radical, non-conventional action. His full research note is online here (pdf) Richard Barwell of RBS writes that despite Mario Draghi's \"verbal pyrotechnics\", the ECB's strategy is still to sit tight and hope inflation picks up. He writes: QE was not 'neglected' in the discussion of unconventional tools to cope with the risks of a too prolonger period of low inflation. However, when it came to the critical question of how that programme would be designed, President Draghi reported that the Council was still 'reflecting hard'. There appear to be differences of view in the Council on the design of such a programme - on how to handle the problems of sufficient supply and financial stability with a purchase programme focused on private sector assets, and how to make a capital markets centric Anglo Saxon model of government bond purchases work in the bank centric Eurozone. Ishaq Siddiqi of ETX Capital is more complimentary, saying \"Super Mario again proves he is a master wordsmith\": Draghi says rates were kept on hold on the basis of the ongoing recovery taking place in the euro zone which is valid given the series of data we have had out of the region which certainly suggests a tepid recovery is in play. He kept it all very dovish though, saying the ECB will act at any time with all measures considered but only if inflation expectations change and the EUR gains more strength \u2013 not so much a direct message to battle deflation. For that, Draghi said he\u2019s not impressed by the deflationary threat that\u2019s sweeping through the euro zone but reckons that inflation hasn\u2019t declined enough to warrant unconventional action, essentially suggesting that ECB will exhausted conventional measures like rate cuts first before they consider the big guns. Trevor Greetham, Director of Asset Allocation and Portfolio Manager of Fidelity\u2019s Multi Asset funds, isn't impressed by Draghi's jaw-boning. \u201cECB President Mario Draghi says the Governing Council is open to \u201cunconventional ease\u201d if necessary in order to avoid an overly long period of low inflation or to offset economic problems caused by currency strength or geopolitical risk (a nod to Putin). \u201cThis is more monetary-policy-on-the-cheap. The aim is to talk down the euro without actually doing anything. \u201cThere\u2019s still a fairly high threshold to action in my view. The ECB knows that shoring up the euro area is unfinished business and systemic risk could rise again. Starting QE when growth is good and confidence is high wastes the possible usefulness of such an announcement during a time of stress. \u201cGrowth in Europe is still pretty unexciting and the central bank isn\u2019t going for growth in the way we\u2019ve seen in the US, UK or Japan. We remain underweight European equities in our multi asset funds.\u201d Reaction to today's European Central Bank press conference is flooding in. ING's Carsten Brzeski says that Mario Draghi has run out of verbal ammunition Ken Wattret of BNP Paribas says the ECB is inching towards QE, but isn't there yet: While there was nothing in the way of policy action today, the press conference nonetheless represents a further step towards policy action from the ECB, potentially to include more radical measures. Chris Huddleston, head of money markets at Investec Corporate and Institutional Treasury, reckons the ECB is more likely to impose negative rates on eurozone banks, rather than embark on QE. \"Mario Draghi has strengthened his pledge that he is ready and waiting to take further policy action to head off the risk of deflation. A rising euro and high unemployment could force the ECB to introduce measures, one of which could be negative rates.\" Alistair Cotton, corporate dealer at Currencies Direct, agrees: Negative interest rates are still more likely at this stage than outright Quantitative Easing, as the Eurozone does not have pan-Eurozone \u2018Eurobonds\u2019 to buy up so it would need to purchase a combination of bonds from Germany, Italy, Spain and the rest. It\u2019s not decided what proportion these would need to be in, and finding agreement would be a political nightmare. More to follow... Here's exactly how Mario Draghi took a pop at IMF chief Christine Lagarde, when asked to comment on her warning yesterday that the ECB should take more action (see 2.23pm) The IMF has been of recent extremely generous in its suggestions on what we should do or not do, and we are really thankful for that. Frankly, I would like the IMF to be as generous as they have been towards us also with other monetary policy jurisdictions, like for example issuing statements just the day before am FOMC (U.S. Federal Reserve) meeting would take place. Over in New York, the Dow Jones industrial average has hit a new all-time record high at the start of Wall Street trading. The Dow is up 28 points, or 0.2%, at 16601, in early trading. That's the end of the ECB press conference - reaction to follow! Another question about an ECB QE programme -- Draghi agrees that there are various options in which QE could be done, (partly due to the kind of assets it would buy) That's why it is is really important to design a proper ABS (asset-backed securities) programme, he says. Europe needs a proper system in which bank loans can be packaged together into high-quality assets, and sold on, he says. And there are clearly disagreements in the governing council over how a quantitative easing programme is designed, with Draghi referring to \"different preferences\". As he puts it, it is hard to design a programme to buy private assets which is large enough to do some good, without threatening financial stability. A well-targeted LTRO* would increase lending to the real economy, but that would have to be well-designed, says Draghi. A badly-designed one wouldn't help at all. * - Long-Term Refinancing Operation -- in which the ECB would offer ultra-cheap loans to banks. Former senior ECB policy-maker Francesco Papadia isn't convinced by Draghi's comments on the eurozone bank stress test programme: Interesting discussion about the output gap in the euro area - Draghi says there are still clear signs of unutilised capacity, or slack, in the economy, dragging down demand and price stability. It took a while, but the euro has now fallen against the US dollar - down almost half a cent at $1.372. OUCH. Mario Draghi is asked to comment on Christine Lagarde's comments yesterday about how the eurozone needs more unconventional monetary policy. Looking most displeased, the ECB president says he \"really values\" the IMF's contribution, and adds that he hopes they can be as generous in their advice to other central banks. Perhaps they could offer some advice the day before the Federal Reserve meets, he suggests, with his sarcasm turned up to stroppy teenager levels. Our bank stress tests have already triggered action, even though the process isn't finished, says Draghi. Mario Draghi is reiterating that quantitative easing has an 'immediate effect' in America, because the Fed can immediately drive up asset prices (by buying Treasury bills). The ECB, though, must work through the bank lending channel, he repeats. That's why any QE programme must be carefully designed. Hedge fund manager Lex van Dam agrees that an ECB-style QE programme would probably focus on bank loans: Mario Draghi's opening statement is online here: Introductory statement to the press conference Gosh - Draghi then says that his biggest fear, a protracted period of stagnation, is now \"to some extent\" a reality. The ECB president doesn't sound too happy, pointing out that many of the eurozone's biggest problems are \"structural\" (and thus beyond the power of the ECB to solve) The governing council also spent some time discussing whether to impose negative deposit rates on eurozone banks (currently they receive nothing for leaving money with the ECB) Mario Draghi is now explaining that any eurozone QE programme would need to be carefully designed. The governing council will \"reflect hard\" on what such as programme would take, he says -- a sign that there isn't agreement over how it could be done? He is also arguing that the eurozone is not, yet, in a situation where it needs to embark on QE. The longer inflation remains low, Draghi explains, the higher the risks. And he also says that it's harder for the eurozone to launch QE than for, say, the Federal Reserve. Our institutional and financial set-up is different to the US, he adds. That might be a hint that it would buy asset-backed securities, rather than sovereign debt, suggests ECB expert Lorcan Roche Kelly. In a busy day for economic news, the IMF has warned that the sluggish global recovery will leave interest rates in rich countries at historic lows for several years. In its World Economic Outlook, the Washington-based organisation said it expects rates to rise gently over the next couple of years in response to higher GDP growth, but that they will be pegged by a stuttering performance by Europe and slower growth in China. The IMF blamed the Asian savings glut alongside a longstanding demand for safe haven assets and a lack of investment opportunities, especially in the developed world, for the persistence of low global rates. It said that while the 2008 financial crisis had exacerbated the problem, low interest rates stretched back 30 years and many of the fundamental drivers will remain in place when the crisis is a distant memory (whenever that might be...) The story in full. In about half an hour's time the OECD will be releasing its latest economic surveys on the EU and Euro Area at a press conference in Brussels with Secretary-General Angel Gurria. We'll bring you that story once it's ready. Here's the key quote from Mario Draghi, explaining how the governing council discussed the possibility of quantitative easing. \"All instruments that fall within the mandate, including QE, are intended to be part of this statement. There was, in fact, during the discussion we had today, there was a discussion of QE.\" And he also declared that all members of the governing council were \"unanimous in its commitment to using all unconventional instruments within its mandate in order to cope effectively with risks of a too prolonged period of low inflation.\" In short: QE is ON THE TABLE, although its not clear how close the ECB is to actually taking the plunge. Does the reference to unanimity in today's statement imply that the ECB was not unanimous last month? Draghi replies that the difference this month is that QE was considered -- it wasn't talked about in March's meeting. What would it take for you to act, if a 0.5% inflation rate isn't enough, asks Brian Blackstone of the WSJ. Draghi pins some of the blame for weak inflation on Easter coming particularly late this year. Easter usually pushes prices higher (as there is more demand for flights etc). So inflation should rise in April, he suggests. Draghi is now explaining that today's \"rich discussion\" also covered the possibility of lowering interest rates. But the revelation that QE was discussed has caused a real stir: Onto questions, and the FT's Claire Jones asks for clarity about the unconventional measures which the governing council is \"unanimous\" in committing to. Does it include a quantitative easing programme? Draghi says that the statement says that all instruments that fall within the mandate, including QE, are on the table. There was a discussion of QE today, he adds. It was not neglected, in what was a \"rich discussion\", says Draghi. Surely an important development -- given the ongoing uncertainty over whether the ECB could launch a bond-buying programme without violating its mandate, and with Germany's support. The statement ends with Draghi's traditional call to eurozone government to continue their economic reforms. He also urges them to liberalise their labour markets to boost employment. There has been significant progress in improving bank funding conditions since Summer 2012, Draghi continues, but more needs to be done. Draghi also pledges to closely monitor the repercussions from geopolitical risks &amp; exchange rate risks. The risks to economic growth are on the downside, Draghi says. But the governing council sees the risks to inflation and deflation as limited, and broadly balanced. If Draghi is trying to talk the euro down, he'll have to talk try harder -- it is actually a little higher now at $1.378. Draghi adds that the ECB's governing council was \"unanimous\" in its commitment to using all unconventional instruments within its mandate to cope with the risk of low inflation becoming entrenched. Draghi is taking a dovish line, saying that the ECB will consider all available instruments at its disposal. We are resolute in our determination to maintain a high degree of accommodative monetary policy, he says. We do not exclude further monetary policy easing, he adds, and \"firmly reiterates\" the ECB's forward guidance that interest rates will remain at their current levels, or lower, for an extended period. Draghi begins by explaining that today's meeting was attended by Olli Rehn. The moderate recovery in the eurozone is continuing, Draghi says, but the ECB also sees a prolonged period of low inflation before gradually rising. The press conference is underway, after the cameramen have taken a flurry of photos of Draghi and his vice-president, Vitor Constancio. Draghi will start by reading a prepared statement (which will then be published online), and then take questions from the Frankfurt press pack. Nearly time for Mario Draghi's press conference. It will be streamed live here. I'll cover the key points, and reaction from the City and social media (often the best element of an ECB presser) If an inflation rate of just 0.5% doesn't prompt the ECB into action, what will, asks the WSJ's Paul Hannon: Here's Associated Press's take on the ECB's decision not to cut interest rates today, by Jurgen Baetz. ECB leaves rates on hold despite inflation worries The European Central Bank left its main interest rate unchanged Thursday despite evidence that the economy of the 18-country eurozone is weak, with inflation continuing to fall and unemployment stuck near a record high. The ECB's decision to leave the rate at a record-low 0.25 percent is certain to prompt questions about whether it might soon resort to less conventional measures to boost the economy, such as a new round of cheap loans to banks or large-scale purchases of financial assets, as the U.S. Federal Reserve has done. President Mario Draghi is set to discuss the ECB governing council's policy decision later Thursday, and investors will be watching for any hints of future action. Data released on Monday showed the annual inflation rate across the eurozone dropped to 0.5 percent in March down from 0.7 percent in February. The decline the third in as many months underlined concerns that consumer prices could start to fall outright, starting a so-called deflation. That risks creating a situation in which consumers and businesses put off purchases in hopes of better deals down the line and companies cut prices to entice buyers. Such a downward spiral chokes off economic growth and can be difficult to get out of Japan was stuck in deflation for two decades. The ECB has said the eurozone is experiencing a \"protracted period of low inflation\" but dismisses fears of an outright deflation. Unemployment, meanwhile, remains stuck near a record-high of around 12 percent following years of economic and financial upheaval. In the countries hardest-hit by the crisis like Greece and Spain, more than one in four people are still jobless. Besides having a social cost, high unemployment also weighs on consumption and the wider economy. The EU predicts the eurozone will grow 1.1 percent this year. While that would be the bloc's best performance since 2011, it would still pale in comparison to the U.S. economy, which is expected to grow around 3 percent. This week's new dip in inflation came at a time when the euro has been buoyant in foreign exchange markets. But a higher currency can push inflation further down in two ways: It can make imports cheaper and weigh on economic activity by making exports more expensive on international markets. The prospect of a looming deflation, meanwhile, is especially worrisome for those eurozone nations already unable to support growth because of their overly high debt burden. That's because when prices fall, it becomes harder to service debts, which are fixed in nominal terms. Among the possibilities the ECB might be considering in the near future, analysts say, might be large-scale purchases of financial assets such as government bonds with newly created money, as the U.S. Federal Reserve has done. That would increase the amount of money in the economy and aim to lower market interest rates and stoke inflation. But such a move faces legal, political and technical obstacles. Besides offering a new round of cheap loans to banks, the ECB could also trim its deposit rate below zero, effectively penalizing banks for holding money at the ECB instead of lending it out in the economy. Anyone for Draghi bingo? Bloomberg's Jonathan Ferro reckons Mario Draghi might adopt a new dovish plumage at today's press conference, to talk the euro down a bit. There's hardly any reaction on the FX markets, where the euro inched up just 0.02% to $1.377, from $1.3765 beforehand. That shows the market was pricing in a very small chance of rates being cut. So, despite inflation falling to just 0.5% in January, the European Central Bank's governing council has resisted launching fresh measures to stimulate growth and drive prices up. It has voted to: leave the headline borrowing rate unchanged at 0.25%; leave the marginal lending facility (charged on banks who borrow from the ECB) at 0.75%; leave the deposit facility (paid to banks who deposit with the ECB) unchanged at 0.0% Now it's up to Mario Draghi to justify this inaction, at a press conference in 40 minutes. Breaking: The European Central Bank has voted to leave its main interest rates unchanged at their current record lows. The euro has been stable today, currently trading at $1.3765 against the US dollar. ECB watchers are doing their best to build the tension up.... Just 2 minutes now.... Just five minutes until the European Central Bank's decision on monetary policy is announced.... Speaking of Spain, the Madrid Treasury held a successful debt auction this morning -- raising almost \u20ac5.6bn at lower yields (interest rates). This included \u20ac1.6bn of 10-year debt, at a yields of just 3.29%. Ishaq Siddiqi of ETX Capital reckons \"the worst of the crisis\" is over in Spain: Moreover, it\u2019s a fine example of a \u2018peripheral\u2019 country implementing structural reforms, initiatives and austerity to stimulate growth better than Italy, Greece and Portugal. Furthermore, Spain just sold a total of EUR5.58b of bonds in an auction which we well-bid with ample demand, confirming the upbeat picture surrounding investor appetite for Spanish debt \u2013 it\u2019s hard not to be inspired by Spain\u2019s progress. Spain's stock market is outpacing the rest of Europe. The IBEX has gained 0.8% today, as Madrid traders welcome the news this morning that the Spanish service sector grew at a faster pace last month (see this morning's blogpost for the details) Just under forty-five minutes until the European Central Bank announces the result of today's governing council meeting. Economists still don't expect any new measures from the ECB, despite inflation hitting just 0.5% last month. Peter Dixon at Commerzbank explains that the Bank will hope that prices will now pick up this month: \"The ECB is primarily concerned about what is happening with inflation, and yes we have too little for the ECB's comfort. \"But I think they want to see if the most recent set of numbers marks a trough before acting further.\" The Bank of England has also released correspondence with prisoners who were incarcerated in the 18th and 19th century for the crime of forging banknotes. It includes details of how the Bank actually provided some funds to convicts in places like Newgate Gaol, particularly women and their children, who could be transported rather than executed if they agreed to a plea bargain. For example: Johanna McCarthy writes on 8 April 1818 from the Maria ship at Deptford that \u2018I am quite destitute of money and friends and have been confined in Newgate Bristol 13 months\u2019. The Committee for Lawsuits records that McCarthy and two other female convicts who were \u2018on the point of sailing to Botany Bay\u2019 be paid \u00a35 each by the Solicitor in response to their pleas for relief. The full details are here, in the BoE archive. This is rather neat - the Bank of England has released a swathe of new documents from its archive. It includes a photo gallery on Flickr, of photos going back over a century. Worth a look. Willem Buiter, Citigroup's chief economist, reckons the European Central Bank won't take action today, but Mario Draghi may express concern over the strength of the euro: Europe's stock markets are treading water ahead of the ECB decision and press conference. The news overnight of a new mini-stimulus package in China has not sparked a rally (Beijing is putting more money into railway construction, and offering new tax breaks to small firms) FTSE 100: down 5 points at 6653, -0.1% German DAX: down 4 points at 9618, -0.05% French CAC: down 3 points at 4427, - 0.1% Traders are also waiting for tomorrow's US jobs data. Will Hedden of IG says that market sentiment is \"difficult to gauge, much like the London skyline through the morning\u2019s smog\": Macro event positioning, which is a clever way of saying doing nothing ahead of the European Central Bank meeting and non-farms, is the order of the day. Scribes at UBS have boosted Tullow Oil (4%) to the top of the index this morning by upgrading them to buy, and the market likes B&amp;Q owner Kingfisher\u2019s (+2%) spot of cross-channel shopping as they pick up a controlling stake in French DIY chain Mr Bricolage. We've also seen an IPO in London this morning, with online technology service Just Eat floating: Just Eat shares rise on stock market debut Retail sales across the eurozone rose 0.4% last month, according to Eurostat, which may calm some fears over the state of Europe's economy. The stats body reports that the retail sales in the non-food sector rose 0.8%, and there was a 0.3% increase in \u201cFood, drinks and tobacco\u201d. Automotive fuel sales fell by 0.8%. The figures strip out inflation (or deflation, in some countries), and may show that consumers are feeling a little more confident. However, it's hardly a strong reading. IHS's Howard Archer comments: February\u2019s further growth in retail sales boosts hopes that consumers are perking up and can help Eurozone growth to firm. It may also take some pressure off the ECB to take fresh action today -- rising retail sales do not suggest that consumers expect deflation to take hold (as they'd probably hold back purchases until prices have dropped) (well, February, but Simon's point stands) On an annual basis, the retail sales index increased by 0.8% in the euro area and by 1.5% in the wider EU. Here's some detail from eurostat: The highest [monthly] increases in total retail trade were registered in Malta (+1.9%), Denmark, Romania and the United Kingdom (all +1.4%) and Germany (+1.3%), and the largest decreases in Estonia (-3.4%), Poland (-1.5%), Slovenia and Finland (both -1.4%). Andrew Tyrie also asked George Osborne about the Financial Services Authority, and the botched way it pre-briefed its inquiry into the life insurance industry last week. The chancellor said that we must expect the FCA to abide to the same high standards of regulation as the rest of the City. Tyrie (who is deeply worried about the incident) hammered home the point that the inquiry into the UK financial watchdog must be fully independent. Why has the Treasury said it wants to 'discuss' the conclusions as they come out? Osborne says the inquiry will be independent, but the Treasury wants to ensure markets are working properly. More with Andy Sparrow's liveblog from Parliament. Heads-up: Chancellor George Osborne is appearing before the Treasury committee to discuss last month's Budget. Here's the livefeed. It began with chairman Andrew Tyrie asking whether this year's Budget had been better received this year, because it wasn't leaked this time. Osborne replied that he wasn't responsible for leaks in previous years (mentioning the Evening Standard's accidental tweeting of its front page too early in 2013). And after last year's experience, he ended the practice of pre-releasing of budget information to the media. Andrew Sparrow is live-blogging it here: And here's the chart showing how new orders into Britain's service sector dropped last month: Just in - growth in the UK service sector has fallen to its lowest rate since last June, but is still fairly robust. Markit's UK Services PMI, based on data from thousands of firms across the country, dropped to 57.6, from 58.2 in February. Any reading above 50 shows growth, and this graph shows how activity spiked last summer as Britain's recovery got under way. Companies reported a slowdown in the growth in new order, and also hired fewer new employees. But they remain confident about future prospects. David Noble, CEO at the Chartered Institute of Purchasing &amp; Supply, reckons the UK services sector - a dominant part of the economy \u2013 is stabilising: \"As a whole, we may be seeing a slight downward trend at the start of this year, but we are hopeful that this healthy outlook is where we are now heading.\u201d The full report is here. The pound has dropped a little, losing 0.17 cents against the US dollar to $1.661. Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit, said this week's data shows the UK economy continued to grow steadily last month: \u201cWhile March saw growth slow across the services, manufacturing and construction sectors, all three continue to expand at very strong rates, meaning the economy looks to have grown by at least 0.7% again in the first quarter. Growth across the eurozone private sector slowed a little in March and firms kept slashing prices in a bid to drive demand - adding to already weak inflation in the euro area. Markit's 'Composite PMI', based on this morning's service sector data and manufacturing reports early this week, fell to 53.1 from 53.3 a month earlier. Markit reported that Ireland and France's private sectors both posted their best monthly growth in several years, while Germany and Italy both saw weaker growth:\uf0a7 Nations ranked by all-sector output growth Ireland: 59.0 - 85-month high Germany: 54.3 - five-month low Spain: 54.2 - two-month high France: 51.8 - thirty-one month high Italy: 51.1 - three-month low Markit said the report was consistent with eurozone GDP rising by 0.5% in the first three months of 2014, which would be an improvement on the previous quarter's 0.3% expansion. The good news was that new orders rose in March, meaning a slight increase in the backlog of work. The bad news is that firms kept cutting the prices they charge -- meaning output charges have declined for the last two years. Input cost inflation fell to an eight-month low, which is another nudge to the ECB to take fresh action at today's policy meeting. Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit, said the ECB should be worried: Prices charged by manufacturers fell for the first time in seven months and charges levied for services were cut at a stronger rate, having fallen continually over the past 28 months. \u201cThe weakening price indices will stoke fears that deflationary forces are intensifying amid weak demand and near-record unemployment. But the survey responses also show that companies are pricing more aggressively, having become leaner and more productive \u2013 which bodes well for competitiveness.\u201d That German service sector PMI reading is someway below expectations.... But growth in Germany's services sector slowed in March, with its Services PMI falling to 53.0 from 56.4 in February. That's still comfortably in 'expansion' territory (&gt;50). France's services sector has reported its strongest growth in over two years, with its Services PMI jumping to 51.5, from 47.2 in February. Bad news from Italy - activity in its service sector shrank last month, as firms failed to maintain the momentum recorded in February. The Italian service sector PMI fell to 49.5 in March, from 52.9 - which indicates a small fall in activity (50 is the cut-off point between growth and contraction). Data firm Markit found that new business growth slowed and firms kept cutting their workforce. Prices also kept falling, but at a lower rate than last month. On the upside, firms are more confidence about future prospects. Economist Phil Smith said: Unlike in manufacturing, where a recovery is now in full flow, the service sector looks to be stuck in a low gear with subdued domestic demand still weighing on activity. Confidence among consumers and businesses alike is finally being restored, however, a factor which may help stimulate growth going forward. Spain's service sector has grown for the fifth month in a row, but firms are cutting jobs, according to Markit's monthly survey of purchasing managers across the country. The Spanish Services PMI rose to 54.0 in March, up from 53.7, as the recovery in Spain's services sector continues. Markit reports a \"slight acceleration\" in the growth of activity and new orders. Encouragingly, business sentiment hit its highest level in almost seven years, as firms try to put the pain of Spain's recent recession behind it. However, firms are cutting prices to drive demand -- in another warning signal for the ECB. Markit said: A further solid reduction in prices charged was recorded as companies reacted to strong competition and pressure from clients for discounts. And employment fell for the second month running in March, after rising in January. More here. Bank of England governor Mark Carney has refused to rule out raising interest rates ahead of next May's general election, in a trip to Durham. Carney told The Northern Echo that hiking borrowing costs from their current record lows would show that the UK economy had improved. Asked if he would rule out a rise before next Spring's election, he said: \"No, absolutely not. He conceded that borrowers wouldn't applaud an interest rate rise: \"When you raise interest rates it is a welcome sign. I share my colleague Charlie Bean's view that it is confirmation the economy is recovering after some very difficult years. \"I'm not sure we will get a lot of cards or letters to thank us, but we will do it when it needs to happen. Here's our take: Mark Carney won't rule out pre-election interest rate rise There's a broad consensus that the ECB is unlikely to take action today, even though inflation is at a four-year low. Reuters reports: Policymakers have been willing in recent weeks to publicly broach cutting deposit rates below zero - effectively charging banks to hold cash with the ECB - or embarking on bond purchases as the United States, Japan and Britain have. A straightforward cut in the ECB's main refinancing rate to 0.1 percent from 0.25 percent - or more complex changes to existing market programmes - are other possibilities. But there has been little sense that a majority of officials favours imminent use of any of those tools even though inflation has been below 1 percent for six months. Instead most may prefer to keep such policies on standby in case of an external economic shock. \"Policy rhetoric should lean in the direction of dovish. But it is unlikely that current economic and market conditions meet the watermark for ECB action,\" said Lena Komileva, managing director of G+ Economics. Matt Boesler of Business Insider agrees: Many believe persistent low inflation will force the ECB to ease further this year, but only three of the 57 economists polled by Bloomberg expect such an announcement to come out of Thursday's meeting. And do check out Ambrose Evans-Pritchard in the Telegraph. He warns that the ECB's \"spectacular idiocy\" in not fighting falling inflation is driving Italy, France and Spain into perilous debt traps, undermining the progress made in lowering their deficits. Here's a flavour: Laurence Boone and Ruben Segura-Cayuela, from Bank of America, say their \"inflation surprise\" index keeps ratcheting lower as one shock after another hits the eurozone, while their gauge of \"deflation vulnerability\" has been flashing red for most EMU countries. The effect is deeply corrosive even if the region never crosses the line into technical deflation. \"Lowflation\" near 0.5pc can play havoc with debt trajectories if it goes on for long, ultimately throwing Europe back into a debt crisis. \"The biggest threat to public debt dynamics is weaker-than-expected inflation. Merely lower than expected inflation, not even deflation, would lead to a significant deterioration in countries\u2019 public finances,\" they said. The bank said lingering \"lowflation\" would cause debt ratios to surge by 2018, rising 10 percentage points in France to 105pc of GDP, 15 points in Italy to 148pc and 24 points to 118pc in Spain. Also coming up today.... The OECD is issuing a new economic survey of the EU and the eurozone, from 2.30pm BST Markit is publishing its PMI surveys for Service Sector companies across the globe UK chancellor George Osborne faces the Treasury committee to discuss Budget 2014, from 10am (which our politics liveblog may cover) Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the financial markets, the world economy, the eurozone and business. The European Central Bank's governing council holds its monthly meeting today, as the spectre of deflation continues to loom over the euro area. With inflation across the euro area dropping to just 0.5% last month, and prices actually falling in several countries, the governing council is under renewed pressure to act. They also have the stern words of Christine Lagarde ringing in their ears. Yesterday, the IMF chief warned that the risk of \"a prolonged period of low inflation, particularly in the eurozone\" was a key threat to global stability. Lagarde insisted that: More monetary easing, including through unconventional measures, is needed in the euro area to raise the prospects of achieving the ECB's price stability objective. The ECB does have several tools at its disposal (as president Mario Draghi often points out): It could cut its headline interest rates again (which would mean banks were charged negative rates for leaving money with the ECB) It could stop 'sterilising' bond purchases made during the height of the eurozone crisis, which would inject more liquidity into the system It could develop a new programme to drive lending to small eurozone firms And, potentially, it could launch a QE-style stimulus programme - last week, the head of the Bundesbank appeared to soften Germany's opposition to this. But despite fears that eurozone is sliding into a Japan-style lost decade, few analysts believe the ECB will take action today. As Nordea Markets analyst Aurelija Augulyte tweets: Why not? Well, the ECB's own forecasts predict that inflation will return close to target by 2016. Falling energy prices are one main factor pushing prices down (although not the only one). And it is keen to see the results of this autumn's bank stress tests, which will weed out failing institutions. Draghi will also get the chance to talk down the euro when he faces the press pack after the decision is announced. The single currency is uncomfortably high at $1.376 to the US dollar - and could push higher if traders conclude that the ECB will keep sitting on its hands. Michael Hewson of CMC Markets agrees that little action is expected today: The consensus still remains for rates to remain on hold, but it is slowly shifting to some form of action with some predicting a cut of 0.15% in the headline rate and a negative deposit rate. This still seems unlikely at this stage, and even if implemented would have little lasting effect after the surprise factor had been digested. On the subject of a negative deposit rate, the implementation of such a measure could well do far more harm than good, particularly with so many European banks already struggling for profitability and looking to build up their balance sheets in preparation for the upcoming \u201cAsset Quality Review\u201d so that they can pass the ECB mandated stress tests due later this year. The ECB decision is announced at 12.45pm BST (or 1.45pm CET), with a press conference 45 minutes later. I'll be tracking all the main action through the day....",

      "bodyText": "A slower-than-expected recovery across the global economy will keep interest rates in rich countries at historic lows for several years, the International Monetary Fund has warned in its World Economic Outlook. Interest rates will rise gently over the next couple of years in response to higher GDP growth, but will likely be pegged back by a stuttering performance by Europe and slower growth in China, the Washington-based organisation said. The gloomy diagnosis will dismay savers, who have seen the value of their savings whittled away by inflation since the financial crisis. Savers are seen as the big losers from the financial crash, which forced central banks to slash rates to almost zero to prevent commercial and residential borrowers from going bust in large numbers. The IMF blamed the Asian savings glut alongside a longstanding demand for safe haven assets and a lack of investment opportunities, especially in the developed world for the persistence of low interest rates across the world. It said that while the 2008 financial crisis had exacerbated the problem, low interest rates stretched back 30 years and many of the fundamental drivers will remain in place when the crisis is a distant memory. It has been known for many years that the accumulated savings of Asian workers, western pension savers and the oil rich countries in the Middle East have outstripped the capacity of the world economy for investment.

George Osborne told MPs on the Treasury select committee that the financial policy committee (FPC) was tasked with monitoring potential risks to the wider economy from the housing market, but conceded the Treasury also had a role to play. \"We have to be vigilant,\" the chancellor said. \"We have to keep a close eye, clearly prices have started to rise.\" Osborne played down the current backdrop, pointing to regional variations in house price rises. London house prices have risen by almost a fifth over the past 12 months, according to Nationwide, and are now 20% above their pre-crisis peak. The average price of a home in the capital is now \u00a3362,699 \u2013 twice the value of homes in the rest of the UK. In the UK overall, houses are selling for 9.2% more than a year ago, according to Nationwide. Osborne said the government was accountable for elements of the housing market, including how the impact of the planning system on housing supply, and the allocation of money for affordable homes. The FPC, on the other hand, was responsible for monitoring other elements, including changes in the mortgage market. He said there were various indicators to monitor whether a bubble was developing: \"You would look at headline prices across the country and try and separate out the central London phenomenon from the rest of the country. You look at sustainability of household debt and at housing starts.\"",
