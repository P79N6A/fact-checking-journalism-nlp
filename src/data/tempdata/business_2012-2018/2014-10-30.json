      "bodyText": "Shares in Standard Chartered slid to their lowest level in five-and-a-half years on Thursday after reports that US authorities had reopened an investigation into the bank over breaching sanctions with Iran. Amid lingering anxiety about the capital position of the emerging markets-focused bank, its shares slumped 5% to 943p \u2013 a level last seen in April 2009. It escalated a fall that began on Tuesday when the London-listed bank\u2019s boss, Peter Sands, admitted it could not achieve its profits promises for the year. The continued slide in the share price \u2013 down more than 30% this year \u2013 piles further pressure on Sands as he prepares to meet the bank\u2019s investors in Hong Kong next month, where he is expected to face questions about strategy and the bank\u2019s capital position. The FTSE 100 index is down just over 4% in the same period. When the bank released its third quarter figures earlier this week, Sands had to concede that itwould not be able to report higher profits for the second half of the year as he had previously pledged. Reports that the US regulators, which fined Standard Chartered \u00a3415m in 2012 for breaching sanctions with Iran, had reopened their investigation was also said to have sparked fresh anxiety in the markets. Neither the US department of justice nor the New York department of financial services would comment on reports that they were looking again at the case. In August, Standard Chartered had warned it could face fresh fines from US authorities and a possible extension of a two-year deferred prosecution agreement due to expire at the end of the year. The bank would not comment on the reports or the market reaction but referred back to the last comments in August. \u201cWe do not comment on media or market speculation; however, we direct your attention to the regulatory compliance disclosures in our 2014 half-year report. Improvement of our sanctions and anti-money laundering systems and training is a top priority for the Bank and will remain so,\u201d a spokesman said. According to reports, the US authorities are looking at whether Standard Chartered hid transactions that were in breach of the sanctions at the time of 2012 settlement. Since then, the bank has had further run-ins with regulators, including being forced to retract comments by chairman Sir Jon Peace in March 2013 after he described the sanctions breaches as \u201cclerical errors\u201d. The bank also insists it is well capitalised and well within regulatory limits, although one shareholder said: \u201cThere is a strong growing belief that it needs more capital.\u201d Ian Gordon, banks analyst at Investec, said bad debts would need to \u201cexplode\u201d before capital became an issue for the bank.",

Speaking at a public accounts committee conference, King said paying tax was on a par in consumers\u2019 minds with taking care of the environment and having good employment practices. \u201cIf we wish to have permission to act in society we must be good citizens,\u201d he said. \u201cBy far the most powerful vote is not the one we make every five years at the ballot box but the one shoppers make day in day out.\u201d Challenged over the strong growth at companies such as Amazon and Starbucks, both widely criticised over their low tax payments in the UK, and Sports Direct, which has been targeted over the use of zero-hours contract staff, King insisted businesses that didn\u2019t behave well were eventually punished by consumers. \u201cThere are many businesses that detach themselves from normal rules for periods of time but eventually the consumer catches up and they are forced to change,\u201d he said. He pointed to the example of Starbucks, which promised to pay an additional \u00a320m in tax over two years in the UK after a string of high-profile consumer campaigns. King said businesses needed to engage with the debate and should not allow themselves to be in a position where politicians were able to win points for highlighting a poor record on tax, as the public accounts committee has done. \u201cThe fact that politicians are laying blows on us [in relation to tax] is a failure on our part,\u201d he said. King said paying tax was a competitive issue not only because consumers noticed which businesses did not behave well but also because the way it was levied gave some businesses, such as online retailers, a competitive advantage. \u201cThe tax system has accelerated the move from physical to online retail,\u201d he said, suggesting a \u201ctrain crash\u201d was coming where the government would need to come up with a different way of taxing businesses not related to buildings. \u201cThe system is begetting its own demise,\u201d he said. He called for a move away from corporation tax and business rates based on the buildings that a business operates from, towards a system based on sales. \u201cI believe the state should have no role in giving competitive advantage to one business over another.\u201d",

US markets opened slightly lower before regaining ground. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.9% and the S&amp;P 500 was up 0.2%.

US inflation is currently running at 1.7% on the consumer price index and is expected to fall further as lower oil prices feed through.</p>", 
      "bodyText": "The US economy grew faster than expected in the third quarter, boosted by a rise in exports and a jump in government defence spending. Annual growth of 3.5% was stronger than the 3% forecast by economists although a slowdown from the 4.6% pace in the second quarter when activity rebounded after the disruption of severe winter storms in the early months of the year. An improved trade performance contributed to growth between July and September, with export growth of 7.8% outpacing imports, which fell by 1.7%. Government spending rose by 10%, following a 16% boost to defence spending, according to the data from the US Bureau of Economic Analysis. Defence spending added 0.66 percentage points to the growth figure, increasing at its fastest rate for five years as the US mounted air strikes against Islamic State militants in Syria and Iraq. However, the pace of growth in business investment, housing and consumer spending slowed from the second quarter, economists said. Consumer spending growth slipped to 1.8% from 2.5% in the previous three months. Fixed investment slowed to 4.7% from 9.5%. \u201cThe report was broadly constructive, but with weakness emerging in housing and consumption spending, we expect the pace of growth to slip further in the fourth quarter,\u201d said Millan Mulraine, deputy chief economist at TD Securities in New York. The better-than-expected overall growth figure echoed the upbeat assessment on the US economy from the Federal Reserve chair, Janet Yellen, a day earlier. Calling time on the central bank\u2019s $4.5tn bond-buying programme, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) suggested recovery was on track with the economy expanding at a \u201cmoderate pace\u201d. Monetary policy would remain loose, it said, with interest rates likely to remain at a record low range of 0% to 0.25% for a \u201cconsiderable time\u201d. However, the growth figures and upbeat assessment raised expectations the Fed might increase rates sooner rather than later, sending the dollar to its highest level in more than three weeks against a basket of currencies. \u201cThe current and projected pace of economic growth is one of the reasons why we still expect the Fed to begin hiking interest rates earlier next year than is widely appreciated, with an increase next March still a distinct possibility,\u201d said Paul Ashworth, chief US economist at Capital Economics. Investors were feeling cautious as they considered the consequences of the third-quarter growth figures and the FOMC\u2019s statement. US markets opened slightly lower before regaining ground. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.9% and the S&amp;P 500 was up 0.2%. In the UK, the FTSE 100 was roughly flat. The International Monetary Fund has forecast the US economy will grow by 2.2% in 2014 overall, the same rate as 2013, and by 3.1% in 2015. Nancy Curtin, chief investment officer of Close Brothers Asset Management, said: \u201cOur view that the US is recovering but not strong enough to trigger a reassessment of still benign monetary policy. The slow path to rate rises in 2015 remains. US growth is good for the world and augurs well for continued improvement in US earnings as we head into the fourth quarter.\u201d Anna Stupnytska, global economist at Fidelity Worldwide Investment, said the Fed would be in no hurry to raise borrowing costs in the absence of inflationary or wage pressures. US inflation is currently running at 1.7% on the consumer price index and is expected to fall further as lower oil prices feed through.",

      "bodyText": "More on the confusion after yesterday\u2019s meeting between Greek and Germany finance ministers. Our correspondent Helena Smith reports: Over in Athens tonight prime minister Antonis Samaras is holding talks with his deputy Evangelos Venizelos amid contradictory reports over the crisis-plagued country\u2019s avowed desire to exit from its \u20ac240bn EU-IMF backed bailout programme. Commotion in the Greek\u2013German axis is nothing new but the re-emergence, overnight, of tensions between Athens and Berlin does not bode well. Despite official denials from the Greek finance ministry that all is going swimmingly with the country\u2019s \u201ctroika of creditors, it would seem that nothing is further from the truth. Samaras and Venizelos meet hours after Germany issued an unusually hard-hitting statement rejecting Greek media reports that it had agreed to support Athens\u2019 avowed desire to exit its rescue programme early. Following talks between Greek finance minister Gikas Hardouvelis and his German counterpart Wolfgang Schauble, several Greek media outlets suggested that Berlin had thrown its weight behind the plan with the conservative daily, Kathimerini, going so far as to announce that Hardouvelis had also managed to secure approval for \u201ca precautionary credit line if all is in place by the end of the year.\u201d Emerging from the meeting in Berlin, Hardouvelis told reporters that the two officials had discussed Greece\u2019s desire to move into a \u201cpost-memorandum\u201d era, free of dependency on foreign lenders, as of January 1. \u201cGermany understands that we should find a solution soon, to delineate this new relationship,\u201d he said. But declaring that the meeting had, in fact, ended inconclusively \u201cwithout concrete results,\u201d Schauble\u2019s spokesman Frank Paul Weber issued an incendiary riposte. \u201cWe reject Greek media reports that Germany and Greece reached an agreement on Wednesday on further support for Greece after the end\u201d of its bailout, the spokesman told Bloomberg. The exit plans \u2013 announced by Samaras in a bid to broaden approval ratings at a time when the possibility of early elections has triggered widespread political uncertainty \u2013 has spooked markets, unnerved investors and worried creditors. The yield on Greek government bonds shot up again Thursday with a rise of 59 basis points to 8.17%. Indicative of the tensions, the IMF spokesman Jerry Rice told reporters today that the return of international auditors to Athens would depend on Greece\u2019s response to demands to push ahead with reforms. Mission heads representing the EU, ECB and IMF cut off an inspection tour of the country\u2019s economy earlier this month. Exiting the programme will depend, to great degree, on what grade Greece achieves when the review is completed. On that note, it\u2019s time to close the blog up for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. Concerns about an earlier than expected US rate rise unsettled investors after the Federal Reserve\u2019s comments overnight, and stronger than forecast US GDP growth added to the idea that dearer borrowing was on the way. But it soon became clear that defence rather than consumer spending had driven much of the increase, helping soothe some of the nerves. So with an opening rise on Wall Street (boosted by a strong performance from Visa), European markets recovered from their initial falls. The closing scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished up 9.68 points or 0.15% at 6463.55 Germany\u2019s Dax added 0.35% to 9114.84 France\u2019s Cac closed 0.74% higher at 4141.24 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB edged up 0.19% to 19,194.61 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended 0.16% better at 10,263.7 In the US, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently 151 points or 0.89% higher. Following a meeting between Greek and German finance ministers, there seems some confusion about what went on. Reuters snaps: 30-Oct-2014 15:35 - GERMAN FINANCE MINISTRY SAYS DENIES GREEK MEDIA REPORTS THAT GERMANY AND GREECE REACHED A DEAL ON FURTHER SUPPORT FOR GREECE AFTER END OF BAILOUT PROGRAMME 30-Oct-2014 15:37 - GERMAN FINANCE MINISTRY SAYS GERMAN AND GREEK FINANCE MINISTERS MET YESTERDAY, BUT WITHOUT CONCRETE RESULTS The European Central Bank has appointed four managers for its asset-backed securities purchase programme. The scheme, part of the ECB\u2019s plan to increase liquidity in the struggling eurozone, is due to start in November once it has been approved by the governing council. The four are: Amundi and Amundi Interm\u00e9diation; Deutsche Asset &amp; Wealth Management International; ING Investment Management; and State Street Global Advisors. Their role, according to the ECB, will be \u201cto conduct the eligible ABS purchase transactions on explicit instructions from, and on behalf of, the Eurosystem, which will undertake price checks and due diligence prior to approving the transactions.\u201d It added: The contracts with the executing asset managers contain a number of provisions to mitigate conflicts of interest, such as the separation of teams working for the ECB and those engaged in any other activities. This will be subject to checks by external auditors. After falling to an all-time low against the dollar, the ruble has jumped more than 3% amid rumours of intervention from the central bank. The Russian currency has been the worst performing emerging market currency over the past month, down 7.1% against the dollar and 7.3% against the euro before today, according to William Jackson at Capital Economics. He said: While this can in part be pinned on the fall in oil prices, the ruble has dropped by more than the previous relationship between the currency and oil prices would suggest. This has raised concerns that Russia could be on the cusp of a self-fulfilling currency crisis. Today\u2019s revival came amid talk of central bank intervention ahead of a monetary policy meeting on Friday. There were also suggestions that Russia and Ukraine may have come to some agreement over Crimea. However cold water was poured on that idea, while the central bank refused to comment on any intervention. Jackson said: Market moves today suggest that the central bank has tried to get ahead of the curve. The ruble has rallied by around 3% against the US dollar from its trough earlier in the day. It\u2019s not quite clear what lies behind this movement (the central bank has refused to comment), but the most obvious explanation is that policymakers have intervened heavily on the foreign exchange market. We had already been expecting a 100 basis point rate hike at the Russian central bank\u2019s MPC meeting tomorrow. However, in addition to a sizeable jump in rates, there\u2019s a possibility that the central bank brings its shift to a fully-floating exchange rate to a halt, instead using foreign exchange intervention to maintain a tighter grip on the currency. In spite of this, we expect the ruble to remain weak over the coming years. Meanwhile Simon Quijano-Evans at Commerzbank agreed there could have been central bank action. He told Reuters: This...looks like indirect indications by the central bank to the local banking community that \u2018enough is enough\u2019 and/or a substantial one-off FX intervention by the central bank. European stock markets are still down, amid growing concerns that the US Fed could hike rates sooner than expected after last night\u2019s upbeat statement which ended its quantitative easing programme. The Fed would have seen in advance today\u2019s strong GDP numbers which showed the economy grew by 3.5% in the third quarter. The dollar has rallied against the pound and the euro. Markets have also been spooked by comments from the European banking regulator that banks need to do more work, even those that passed the stress tests. The FTSE 100 index has pared earlier losses and is now down some 22 points at 6430.93, a 0.4% fall. Germany\u2019s Dax is 1% lower and France\u2019s CAC has lost 0.5%. On Wall Street, the Dow Jones is 0.6% ahead while the Nasdaq is off 0.35% and the S&amp;P 500 has edged down 0.1%. With that, I\u2019m handing over to my colleague Nick Fletcher. Returning to the European confidence data, ING economist Peter Vanden Houte says the European Commission business and consumer survey turned out be a pleasant surprise. The overall economic sentiment index rose from 99.9 to 100.7, confounding the consensus expectation for a small drop. The business climate indicator increased to 0.05 from 0.02 in August. The increase in overall sentiment in September was across the board, with all sectors seeing an improvement in confidence. The export-sensitive industrial sector showed a more optimistic view on both expected production and order books. The weakening of the euro exchange rate is finally giving some breathing space to European exporters, leading to more optimism. Confidence in the more domestically oriented services and retail trade sector also both improved, while consumer confidence staged a slight increase on the back of better employment perspectives. Finally the construction sector saw a significant boost in confidence. Capacity utilization in the manufacturing sector increased to 80%, typically the level where investment expenditure starts to pick up. The country breakdown, meanwhile, revealed that confidence in the bigger countries increased a bit unexpectedly (given the fact that other sentiment indicators were less upbeat) in Germany, France, Italy and the Netherlands, while it decreased in Spain. As today\u2019s figures suggest that the eurozone recovery is not doomed yet, the ECB will probably sit on its hands in the coming months, monitoring how previously announced policy measures are playing out. However, with inflation still hovering close to 0%, the pressure to act is likely to increase again. As it seems unlikely that the bank will be able to purchase sufficient assets to increase its balance sheet by \u20ac1 trillion, we believe that around the turn of the year the ECB will broaden the range of eligible assets for purchase to corporate bonds and supra-national bonds. Ultimately it might still have to consider buying sovereign bonds, but that will probably not happen before the second quarter of 2015. US stocks dipped at the open, but the Dow Jones is now trading 0.3% higher at 17,25.24 while the S&amp;P 500 has slipped 0.1% and the Nasdaq is down 0.6%. Carsten Brzeski at ING has looked at the German jobless numbers in detail. Did anyone say crisis? The German labour market remains solid as a rock, defying all woes from a weakening industry. Unemployment decreased by a non-seasonally adjusted 75,000 in October, bringing the total number of unemployed down to 2.733 million. In seasonally-adjusted terms, unemployment dropped by 22,000, leaving the seasonally-adjusted unemployment rate unchanged at 6.7%. The revival of the German labour market is gaining momentum. In fact, the October improvement was the best October performance since 2011, indicating that the story on the possible vacation impact on the German economy in August and September could have been for real. Now that finally all Germans are back from vacation, the labour market is accelerating. The labour market remains the backbone of the German economy. Thanks to earlier reforms, ageing and immigration from crisis-battered Eurozone countries, the German labour market seems to have decoupled from the real economy. Or to be more precise, the economy currently needs much less growth than in the past to at least stabilize the labour market. While in the 1990s and early 2000s, it needed GDP growth of at least 1.5% to reduce unemployment, this threshold has come down to below 1%. Looking ahead, the labour market should remain solid, supporting private consumption. Earlier today, the statistical office reported that employment had reached a new all-time-high in September. Moreover, vacancies are increasing again and have almost returned to their all-time high of November 2011. Interestingly, the current split of the German economy into healthy domestic activity and faltering external activity is also reflected in companies\u2019 recruitment plans. Employment expectations in the manufacturing sector have been negative since March, while at the same time employers in the service sector are still hiring and have actually increased their recruitment plans in recent months. To recap, today\u2019s economic news has been pretty good. Paul Ashworth, chief US economist at Capital Economics, shares the Fed\u2019s optimism about the economy: Admittedly, consumption growth was a relatively modest 1.8% in the third quarter. But the conditions are in place for a pick-up in the pace of consumption growth. Real personal disposable incomes increased by a healthy 2.7% in the third quarter and, with the prospect of further big gains in employment and the impact of the slump in energy prices, real incomes should enjoy an even bigger gain in the fourth quarter. Business investment growth was also relatively healthy at 5.5%, led by a 7.2% gain in investment in equipment. Residential investment only increased by 1.8%, but we still expect more gains in home building over the next couple of years because the level of housing starts is still running well below population requirements. Finally, after being such a massive drag on the economy in recent years, the public sector is now a big positive. Government consumption increased by 4.6%, led by a 16% jump in defence spending. Overall, we expect the strong growth to continue, with GDP on course for a 3.0% annualised gain in the fourth quarter. More breaking news: German inflation unexpectedly slowed to 0.7% this month, the lowest reading since May. Fed chair Janet Yellen is speaking at a diversity conference at the central bank, but won\u2019t touch on monetary policy or the economic outlook, according to the text of the speech, Reuters reports. Futures are pointing to a lower open on Wall Street, with the Dow Jones set to fall 24 points. Over here, the FTSE 100 index is now trading down less than 40 points at 6414.61, a 0.6% drop. Germany\u2019s Dax has lost 1% and France\u2019s CAC has shed 0.4%. Here\u2019s some instant reaction to the US GDP data from ING economist Rob Carnell. No wonder the FOMC statement erred on the upbeat side on Wednesday. That said, the components of the GDP total make less impressive reading. Consumer spending rose by only 1.8%, down from 2.5% in 2Q14, and fixed investment, though not bad at 4.7%, and faster than overall GDP growth, was also down from the second quarter reading. Structures, equipment, and residential investment spending growth all slowed. What seems to have delivered most of the growth, and offset a substantial (0.57% GDP) drag from inventories, was a reasonable export performance (7.8%QoQ), coupled with a decline in imports (-1.7%), and a big surge in the erratic defense component of government spending. This last element alone added 0.66% to the GDP total. It is unlikely to be repeated any time soon. Having said all this, we suspect the market will be prepared to see through the detail and focus on the better looking total. Following yesterday\u2019s FOMC statement, investors will likely be looking for clues that may see the Fed hiking rates sooner than expected. This data certainly leans in that direction. Though with big falls in inflation looming, we would not be rushing to any hasty conclusions on rates just yet. US economic growth was fuelled by a smaller trade deficit and a surge in defence spending in the third quarter. It was the fourth quarter out of the last five that the economy has expanded by at least 3.5%. The trade position improved because of a sharp fall in imports \u2013 the biggest since the end of 2012, driven by a drop in oil imports. Trade added 1.32 percentage points to overall economic growth of 3.5%. Spot gold dropped nearly 1% to hit a session low of $1,199.90 an ounce. The dollar, already buoyed by last night\u2019s upbeat Fed statement, extended gains against the pound on the strong US GDP data. Sterling hit the day\u2019s low of $1.5950. The number of Americans filing new claims for jobless benefits rose for a second week last week, but remained at levels consistent with a recovering labour market. Jobless claims rose 3,000 to a seasonally adjusted 287,000, the Labor Department said. The US economy grew at a 3.5% annual rate in the third quarter, better than the 3% expected by Wall Street. Ranko Berich, head of market analysis at Monex Europe, says ahead of the US GDP data: The FOMC now believes that holes in the labour market are \u2018gradually diminishing\u2019 and \u2018solid gains\u2019 are being made in job creation. These changes all point in one direction \u2013 rate hikes in 2015. However, rate hikes do remain conditional with key conditions being the continued improvement in inflation and the labour market. For this to happen, the economy itself needs to grow strongly, making today\u2019s first reading of US third quarter GDP even more critical. Should GDP growth meet these high expectations today, the Fed\u2019s hawkishness will only increase and the dollar could find itself ascendant in 2015. In just over an hour, we will get the first estimate for third-quarter GDP growth in the US. Wall Street economists have pencilled in a healthy 3% annual rate between July and September. It would mark the fourth quarter in the past five in which the economy has grown by at least 3%. In the second quarter, the economy expanded by 4.6%, but this was a sharp bounceback from the first quarter when it shrank by 2.1% \u2013 largely due to a harsh winter that disrupted much economic activity. The Commerce Department is due to release the figures at 12.30 GMT. The FTSE 100 index has tumbled 75 points to 6378.93, a 1.16% fall, while Germany\u2019s Dax is down nearly 100 points, a 1% drop and France\u2019s CAC has slid 0.6%. It looks like the prospect of higher interest rates in the US is weighing on markets, after the Fed painted a brighter picture of the economy last night. In London, miners and commodity stocks have taken nearly 25 points off the Footsie. Brent crude oil prices have fallen below $87 a barrel, pressured by the stronger dollar. European banking stocks were hit by comments from Andrew Enria, chairman of the European Banking Authority, who said last week\u2019s stress tests weren\u2019t foolproof and lenders still had a lot of work to do. He told a conference in Berlin this morning: The story is not over, even for the banks who passed it. John Hardy, a currency strategist at Saxo Bank, has told Reuters: It\u2019s really nothing to do with sterling, it\u2019s all dollar strength at the moment on the back of the FOMC meeting last night \u2013 not because the statement was particularly hawkish, but because the market was positioned for a very dovish one. The pound has dropped below $1.60 for the first time in a fortnight after the Fed adopted a slightly more hawkish tone in its latest statement last night, when it ended quantitative easing. This has lifted the dollar against other currencies. Ed Knox, Currency Analyst at currency exchange company Caxton FX, says: The dollar surged against its major peers after the Fed statement, and has helped the greenback to push below 1.60 against the pound and below 1.26 against the euro. The QE announcement as well as causing a widespread dollar strength, also included an unexpected reference to an improving labour market \u2013 the trigger for raising rates. Analysts still expect to see the US raise interest rates before the UK and the demise of QE and the rallying response of the dollar certainly strengthens these expectations. An improving economy for the states then, with the absence of QE. This has already brought about some much needed volatility and the US dollar is now firmly in the driving seat. After the surprise fall in German unemployment in October, the eurozone confidence figures have also come in better than expected. In the City, office rents have hit a new record \u2013 at the Cheesegrater, eclipsing a deal struck at the Shard earlier this year. British Land and Oxford Properties have agreed a deal to let the 41st floor of the Cheesegrater to insurance company FM Global at almost \u00a385 per square foot, Propertyweek writes. A floor spanning around 7,700 sq ft at the Leadenhall Building is now understood to be under offer to the US-based insurer. The price eclipses a deal done by Arma Partners in Irvine Sellar\u2019s Shard earlier this year, at what was hailed at the time to be a record at \u00a380/sq ft. Research carried out by Property Week in August found that average prime rents were \u00a360/sq ft in Q2 in the City of London, compared with \u00a366/sq ft at the end of 2008, before the recession hit. More reaction to Barclays\u2019 Q3 profits and provision for market-rigging. Simon Chouffot, spokesperson for the Robin Hood Tax campaign, says: Half a billion pounds is a colossal sum, but the real shock is the regularity with which banks put aside such provisions for their scams. In what other sector would this be acceptable? Banks shouldn\u2019t be putting money aside to pay for their bad behaviour, they shouldn\u2019t be doing wrong in the first place. A Robin Hood Tax would help curb the greed is good culture in banks and make them contribute positively to society. The fact their profits are once again rising while the rest of the economy suffers shows they can afford it. Let\u2019s have a look at other corporate news. French drugmaker Sanofi, which ousted its chief executive Chris Viehbacher yesterday, has got in touch with AstraZeneca boss Pascal Soriot to sound out his interest in the CEO job, Bloomberg writes. But Soriot, a Frenchman who used to run the pharmaceutical business at Roche, apparently said he wasn\u2019t interested. Royal Dutch Shell enjoyed strong profit growth in the third quarter as more profitable production and lower exploration costs helped compensate for the sharp fall in the price of oil. More here. Profits at BT leapt 13% to \u00a3563m in what boss Gavin Patterson hailed a \u201csolid quarter\u201d as the company maintained its dominance on the market for superfast broadband. Aviva has shrugged off a sharp fall in annuity sales following the UK\u2019s revamp of the pensions system. Under CEO Mark Wilson, the turnaround at the insurer is gathering steam. Restructuring efforts have paid off and it saw new business in life insurance advance by 15% to \u00a3690m in the first nine months of this year. Wilson said: We are in an entirely different position than we were two years ago. This is a self-help story, but there is still very much more to do. Returning to Spain, ING economist Martin van Vliet says the \u2018comeback kid\u2019 lives up to its name. He notes that the Spanish economy retains significant forward momentum, despite some slowdown in the third quarter. The nature of Spain\u2019s economic recovery has clearly changed in recent quarters. For a long time, net exports were the only source of growth, but now that financial conditions have sharply improved and the labour market is turning around, domestic demand is taking over the growth baton. Nevertheless, bank lending is still contracting and unemployment remains extremely high (24.4% in August), which, together with the ongoing (albeit much slower) adjustment in the property sector and the need for further public-sector deleveraging limits the scope for stronger domestic demand growth in our view. Moreover, export growth may lose some of its sparkle in the wake of weak eurozone growth and slowing demand from emerging markets. Indeed, the latest trade reveal that growth in exports to non-EU countries has already stalled. In short, while the growth comeback in Spain has been impressive, it remains premature in our view to assume that a truly self-sustaining recovery has taken hold. We need further confirmation before we can be sure it really is the comeback kid of Europe. Stock markets have turned negative, despite the good economic news out of Germany and Spain. Perhaps it\u2019s the new hawkishness from the US Fed? European stocks erased earlier gains and the FTSE 100 index in London is now trading 0.5% lower at 6422.66, a fall of over 30 points. Spain\u2019s Ibex has lot 1% and Italy\u2019s FTSE MiB is 0.8% lower. The number of unemployed people in Germany, seasonally adjusted, fell by 22,000 to 2.887m this month, according to the country\u2019s Federal Labour Office. The German unemployment data are much better than expected. Industrial &amp; Commercial Bank of China, the world\u2019s largest lender by assets, reported its biggest jump in bad loans since at least 2006 as the property market slumped and the economy cooled, Bloomberg writes. Nonperforming loans rose 9% in the third quarter from the previous three months, the Beijing-based bank said in an exchange filing yesterday. A struggling Chinese economy is weighing on ICBC\u2019s share price and is poised to drag the company to its weakest full-year profit growth since at least 2001 as more borrowers default. Challenges at home may encourage the bank to add to an overseas expansion that already spans Asia, South America and Europe. Spain became the first large EU member state to report Q3 GDP figures this morning. Its preliminary estimate confirmed the Bank of Spain\u2019s forecast of growth of 0.5%, just a tad weaker than the 0.6% seen in Q2. Robert Kuenzel at Daiwa Capital Markets says: That is likely to make the country the only significant source of GDP growth this quarter in the euro area. In London, Standard Chartered shares have lost 6.7p, or 0.675%, to 985.4p. Meanwhile Barclays is up nearly 2% at 224.7p after posting better-than-expected results, despite a \u00a3500m provision related to ongoing investigations into currency rigging. Richard Hunter, head of equities at Hargreaves Lansdown Stockbrokers, says: The beleaguered British bank has come out fighting, with an update which has both beaten expectations and given further confirmation of a recovery story which is beginning to get traction. Inevitability, there are pockets of disappointment within the numbers, such as the performance of the investment bank, the additional provisions for Forex and PPI, and continuing pressure on margins. However, the update is positive on a number of fronts, not least of which is the 5% increase in pre-tax profits (indeed, up 31% in the year to date). This has been largely driven by ongoing strength in the Personal and Corporate Banking and Barclaycard areas, and typified by lower impairments and costs, some material positive releases (Lehman and interest rate hedging) and an improvement in the core capital ratio in the quarter from 9.9% to 10.2%. The sector certainly has issues, and Barclays has been far from exempt from these in terms of profits and reputation, such that the share price has dipped 17% over the last year, as compared to a 5% drop for the wider FTSE100. Nonetheless, the throng of believers in the company\u2019s recovery is growing, with the market consensus recently having strengthened to a strong buy. European markets have taken the end of QE in the US in their stride. The FTSE 100 index opened 0.4% higher and is now up some 3 points, while Spain\u2019s Ibex rose 0.6%, and Germany\u2019s Dax 0.2%. France\u2019s CAC and Italy\u2019s FTSE MiB advanced 1%. In France, stocks are getting a lift from upbeat corporate results. Renault upgraded its European car market growth forecast, telecoms equipment maker Alcatel-Lucent improved its gross profit margin in the latest quarter and oil services group Technip posted better-than-expected profits. The third-quarter US GDP data due later today will shed more light on how well founded the Fed\u2019s optimism about the economy is. Out at 12.30 GMT, the figures are expected to show an annual growth rate of around 3%, down from the weather-related bounceback of 4.6% in the second quarter. Weekly jobless claims, after hitting a 14-year low earlier this month, are expected to rise a tad to 285,000 from 283,000. Soon after that, Fed chair Janet Yellen will give a speech in Washington on diversity in the economic profession. Before that, we get the latest unemployment data from Germany for October (8.55am GMT), where concerns are growing that the economy is flatlining and could well slip back into recession. In September unemployment rose by 12,000 and this is expected to come down to a rise of 4,000 with the unemployment rate staying at 6.7%, one of the lowest in the euro area. Confidence data for the eurozone are out at 10am GMT. We will also get German inflation for October (1pm GMT), which could nudge up to 0.9% from 0.8%. This would make it \u201cmuch less likely that the Germans will feel inclined to acquiesce to demands for the ECB to embark on any form of full blown QE program,\u201d Hewson notes. And Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK, says: The committee also played down the risk of below target inflation while also stating that the amount of spare capacity appeared to be gradually diminishing, suggesting that if the data continued to improve then we could well see a rate hike sooner than expected. As always the Fed insisted that any move on rates would be data dependant, but given some of the recent chatter from various FOMC voting and non-voting members alike the tone of the statement was all the more surprising for its hawkish tone, particularly given that there was no mention of the problems in Europe, the slowdown in China or concerns about a strong US dollar keeping inflation low. Markets are still digesting last night\u2019s news of the end of QE3 in the US. The Federal Reserve, headed by Janet Yellen, ended its $4.5 trillion quantitative easing programme after more than five years. The announcement had been expected, but the statement issued by the Fed was more hawkish than some had anticipated. Marc Ostwald, strategist at ADM Investor Services International, says: There was always a very substantial risk that QE addicted markets were pinning too much hope on another very dovish statement, which in the event were disappointed, and to compound matters the FOMC adopted a rather more emphatically balanced view of the policy outlook, though as we have stressed, the Fed has been carefully carving out room for manoeuvre since June. Perhaps the irony is that while (gratuitously? Ed.) retaining \u201ca considerable time\u201d, the policy outlook was reformulated in a very balanced fashion: \u201cif incoming information indicates faster progress toward the Committee\u2019s employment and inflation objectives than the Committee now expects, then increases in the target range for the federal funds rate are likely to occur sooner than currently anticipated. Conversely, if progress proves slower than expected, then increases in the target range are likely to occur later than currently anticipated.\u201d The fact that the dissent at this meeting came from a lone dove Kocherlakota, as opposed to the hawkish dissents of Fisher and Plosser at the last meeting, adds a little more emphasis to the policy signal shift, but should not come as any surprise given Kocherlakota\u2019s comments on policy and the inflation outlook. Overall, an initial Q2 2015 rate hike still looks to be on the cards. In other banking news, Barclays has given an indication the scale of the potential fines looming across the banking industry by setting aside \u00a3500m to cover the cost of the on-going investigations into rigging currency markets. Our City editor Jill Treanor writes: The provision is larger than the \u00a3290m of total fines that the bank received for manipulating Libor in 2012 and is being revealed as the Financial Conduct Authority attempts to agree a settlement with six major banks over their activities in the \u00a33.5tn a day foreign exchange markets. The regulator is working towards revealing the outcome of this investigation and the scale of the penalties on the industry next month. Barclays announced the provision as it announced its figures for the third quarter of the year in which it also took an extra \u00a3170m hit to cover the cost of the payment protection insurance misselling scandal. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and the business world. We\u2019ve woken up to the news that prosecutors in Washington and Manhattan have reopened an investigation into Standard Chartered. In August, it already warned of fresh fines from US authorities for breaching money laundering rules. Two years ago, Standard Chartered was fined $667m (\u00a3396m) for scheming with Iran to hide billions of pounds of transactions from the US authorities. The New York Times reports: The prosecutors are questioning whether Standard Chartered, which has a large operation in New York, failed to disclose the extent of its wrongdoing to the government, imperiling the bank\u2019s earlier settlement. A mixture of new issues and lingering problems could violate earlier settlements that imposed new practices and fines on the banks but stopped short of criminal charges, according to lawyers briefed on the cases. Prosecutors are exploring whether to strengthen the earlier deals, lawyers said, or scrap them altogether and force the banks to plead guilty to a crime. The news comes two days after the emerging markets bank issued another profit warning, piling yet more pressure on embattled chief executive Peter Sands.",

He said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>While this can in part be pinned on the fall in oil prices, the ruble has dropped by more than the previous relationship between the currency and oil prices would suggest.

There were also suggestions that Russia and Ukraine may have come to some agreement over Crimea. However cold water was poured on that idea, while the central bank refused to comment on any intervention. Jackson said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Market moves today suggest that the central bank has tried to get ahead of the curve. The ruble has rallied by around 3% against the US dollar from its trough earlier in the day. It\u2019s not quite clear what lies behind this movement (the central bank has refused to comment), but the most obvious explanation is that policymakers have intervened heavily on the foreign exchange market.</p> <p>We had already been expecting a 100 basis point rate hike at the Russian central bank\u2019s MPC meeting tomorrow. However, in addition to a sizeable jump in rates, there\u2019s a possibility that the central bank brings its shift to a fully-floating exchange rate to a halt, instead using foreign exchange intervention to maintain a tighter grip on the currency. In spite of this, we expect the ruble to remain weak over the coming years. </p> </blockquote> <p>Meanwhile Simon Quijano-Evans at Commerzbank agreed there could have been central bank action.

The overall economic sentiment index rose from 99.9 to 100.7, confounding the consensus expectation for a small drop. The business climate indicator increased to 0.05 from 0.02 in August.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The increase in overall sentiment in September was across the board, with all sectors seeing an improvement in confidence. The export-sensitive industrial sector showed a more optimistic view on both expected production and order books. The weakening of the euro exchange rate is finally giving some breathing space to European exporters, leading to more optimism.</p> <p>Confidence in the more domestically oriented services and retail trade sector also both improved, while consumer confidence staged a slight increase on the back of better employment perspectives. Finally the construction sector saw a significant boost in confidence. Capacity utilization in the manufacturing sector increased to 80%, typically the level where investment expenditure starts to pick up.</p> <p>The country breakdown, meanwhile, revealed that confidence in the bigger countries increased a bit unexpectedly (given the fact that other sentiment indicators were less upbeat) in Germany, France, Italy and the Netherlands, while it decreased in Spain.</p> <p><strong>As today\u2019s figures suggest that the eurozone recovery is not doomed yet, the ECB will probably sit on its hands in the coming months, monitoring how previously announced policy measures are playing out.</strong> However, with inflation still hovering close to 0%, the pressure to act is likely to increase again. As it seems unlikely that the bank will be able to purchase sufficient assets to increase its balance sheet by \u20ac1 trillion, we believe that around the turn of the year the ECB will broaden the range of eligible assets for purchase to corporate bonds and supra-national bonds. Ultimately it might still have to consider buying sovereign bonds, but that will probably not happen before the second quarter of 2015.<br></p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-54524478e4b00edaaca009c8\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2014-10-30T14:03:03.136Z\">2.03pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>US stocks dipped at the open, but the Dow Jones is now trading 0.3% higher at 17,25.24 while the S&amp;P 500 has slipped 0.1% and the Nasdaq is down 0.6%.</strong><br></p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-54523960e4b0955202547134\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2014-10-30T13:15:34.727Z\">1.15pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Carsten Brzeski at ING has looked at the German jobless numbers in detail.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p><strong>Did anyone say crisis? The German labour market remains solid as a rock</strong>, defying all woes from a weakening industry. Unemployment decreased by a non-seasonally adjusted 75,000 in October, bringing the total number of unemployed down to 2.733 million. In seasonally-adjusted terms, unemployment dropped by 22,000, leaving the seasonally-adjusted unemployment rate unchanged at 6.7%.<br>  The revival of the German labour market is gaining momentum. In fact, the October improvement was the best October performance since 2011, indicating that the story on the possible vacation impact on the German economy in August and September could have been for real. Now that finally all Germans are back from vacation, the labour market is accelerating.  The labour market remains the backbone of the German economy. Thanks to earlier reforms, ageing and immigration from crisis-battered Eurozone countries, the German labour market seems to have decoupled from the real economy. Or to be more precise, the economy currently needs much less growth than in the past to at least stabilize the labour market. While in the 1990s and early 2000s, it needed GDP growth of at least 1.5% to reduce unemployment, this threshold has come down to below 1%.  Looking ahead, the labour market should remain solid, supporting private consumption. Earlier today, the statistical office reported that employment had reached a new all-time-high in September. Moreover, vacancies are increasing again and have almost returned to their all-time high of November 2011. Interestingly, the current split of the German economy into healthy domestic activity and faltering external activity is also reflected in companies\u2019 recruitment plans. Employment expectations in the manufacturing sector have been negative since March, while at the same time employers in the service sector are still hiring and have actually increased their recruitment plans in recent months. </p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-545238b2e4b0e617f62ec392\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2014-10-30T13:12:04.689Z\">1.12pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>To recap, today\u2019s economic news has been pretty good. Paul Ashworth, chief US economist at Capital Economics, shares the Fed\u2019s optimism about the economy: <br></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Admittedly, consumption growth was a relatively modest 1.8% in the third quarter. But the conditions are in place for a pick-up in the pace of consumption growth. Real personal disposable incomes increased by a healthy 2.7% in the third quarter and, with the prospect of further big gains in employment and the impact of the slump in energy prices, real incomes should enjoy an even bigger gain in the fourth quarter.</p> <p>Business investment growth was also relatively healthy at 5.5%, led by a 7.2% gain in investment in equipment. Residential investment only increased by 1.8%, but we still expect more gains in home building over the next couple of years because the level of housing starts is still running well below population requirements.</p> <p>Finally, after being such a massive drag on the economy in recent years, the public sector is now a big positive. Government consumption increased by 4.6%, led by a 16% jump in defence spending. </p> <p>Overall, we expect the strong growth to continue, with GDP on course for a 3.0% annualised gain in the fourth quarter.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-54523748e4b0aa3b9722b7b0\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2014-10-30T13:05:11.671Z\">1.05pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>More breaking news: German inflation unexpectedly slowed to 0.7% this month, the lowest reading since May. </strong><br></p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-545236a3e4b00edaaca009b1\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2014-10-30T13:02:05.862Z\">1.02pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Fed chair Janet Yellen is speaking at a diversity conference at the central bank, but won\u2019t touch on monetary policy or the economic outlook, according to the text of the speech, <em>Reuters reports</em>.<br></p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2014-10-30T13:03:23.042Z\">at 1.03pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-545235a7e4b0aa3b9722b7af\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2014-10-30T12:58:19.780Z\">12.58pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Futures are pointing to a lower open on Wall Street, with the Dow Jones set to fall 24 points. </p> <p>Over here, the FTSE 100 index is now trading down less than 40 points at 6414.61, a 0.6% drop.

Structures, equipment, and residential investment spending growth all slowed.<br>  What seems to have delivered most of the growth, and offset a substantial (0.57% GDP) drag from inventories, was a reasonable export performance (7.8%QoQ), coupled with a decline in imports (-1.7%), and a big surge in the erratic defense component of government spending. This last element alone added 0.66% to the GDP total. It is unlikely to be repeated any time soon.  Having said all this, <strong>we suspect the market will be prepared to see through the detail and focus on the better looking total.</strong> Following yesterday\u2019s FOMC statement, investors will likely be looking for clues that may see the Fed hiking rates sooner than expected.

For a long time, net exports were the only source of growth, but now that financial conditions have sharply improved and the labour market is turning around, domestic demand is taking over the growth baton.</strong> Nevertheless, bank lending is still contracting and unemployment remains extremely high (24.4% in August), which, together with the ongoing (albeit much slower) adjustment in the property sector and the need for further public-sector deleveraging limits the scope for stronger domestic demand growth in our view. <br></p> <p>Moreover, export growth may lose some of its sparkle in the wake of weak eurozone growth and slowing demand from emerging markets. Indeed, the latest trade reveal that growth in exports to non-EU countries has already stalled. <br></p> <p>In short, while the growth comeback in Spain has been impressive, it remains premature in our view to assume that a truly self-sustaining recovery has taken hold.

However, the update is positive on a number of fronts, not least of which is the 5% increase in pre-tax profits (indeed, up 31% in the year to date).

Conversely, if progress proves slower than expected, then increases in the target range are likely to occur later than currently anticipated.\u201d <br></p> <p>The fact that the dissent at this meeting came from a lone dove Kocherlakota, as opposed to the hawkish dissents of Fisher and Plosser at the last meeting, adds a little more emphasis to the policy signal shift, but should not come as any surprise given Kocherlakota\u2019s comments on policy and the inflation outlook.

The cash \u2013 generated as customers pay back their home loans \u2013 is used to repay the \u00a348.7bn that was loaned to UK Asset Resolution, which was set up to look after the mortgages nationalised when Northern Rock and B&amp;B ran into difficulty in 2008. Richard Banks, UKAR\u2019s chief executive, is aiming to repay the loan in the next 10 years but still expects the organisation to be responsible for \u00a320bn of mortgages even after the money is repaid. He is continuing his efforts to contact 22,000 customers whom UKAR has calculated could be pushed into arrears if interest rates were to rise above their historic low of 0.5%. The number of mortgage customers three or more months in arrears has fallen, as has the number of former customers of Northern Rock who still have loans greater than the value of their homes after taking out one of the lender\u2019s \u201cTogether\u201d mortgages before the 2008 crisis. These loans allowed customers to borrow more than the value of their home. Even with the rise in house prices since the crisis, more than 43,000 of its customers still have a loan larger than the value of their home. This represents some 9% of its customers, although this is down from 18% a year ago and from 35% in 2010. The number of Northern Rock customers has fallen to 260,000 from 298,000 a year ago and the number of B&amp;B customers is down from 193,000 to 175,000. UKAR owns the Northern Rock mortgages that were not bought by Virgin Money in 2011. Since the end of its half-year, 27,000 customers\u2019 mortgages have been sold to a consortium led by the US bank JP Morgan. UKAR is aiming to conduct more of these deals although two-thirds of the mortgages would not be suitable for sale as they are packaged in the Aire Valley and Granite securitisation vehicles used by the banks before the financial crisis. The longest mortgage in UKAR\u2019s portfolio runs to 2049.",

James said:<br></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>As the firsr half closes we downgrade estimates again, with new earnings per share materially below consensus. Our confidence in guided share gains at Mediatek is low, so we cut 2015 estimated royalty units (excluding MIPS) from 578m units to 512m units, which would be a 3% year on year decline. We now forecast just 3% dollar revenue growth in the technology business, with similar growth rates in both royalties and licensing.

      "bodyText": "Imagination Technologies has been a volatile performer since its update in September, and its shares have taken another hit after a negative analyst report. Nick James at Numis has moved his recommendation on the graphics chip specialist from hold to reduce, cut his target price from 200p to 170p and reduced earnings estimates on worries about competition, particular at one of its customers Mediatek. James said: As the firsr half closes we downgrade estimates again, with new earnings per share materially below consensus. Our confidence in guided share gains at Mediatek is low, so we cut 2015 estimated royalty units (excluding MIPS) from 578m units to 512m units, which would be a 3% year on year decline. We now forecast just 3% dollar revenue growth in the technology business, with similar growth rates in both royalties and licensing. The lower revenue drives a 34% cut to 2015 earnings per share to 3.9p from 5.9p (consensus 6.4p). The relatively short window in which the core GPU business held on to strong market share sets a bad precedent for Imagination\u2019s future IP products, for which elevated operating expenditure massively dilutes earnings.

Michael Hewson at CMC Markets UK said: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>While the Federal Reserve kept its \u201cconsiderable time\u201d [until a rate rise] phrase within yesterday\u2019s statement, that was pretty much the only dovish part of it, as the US central bank called time on its asset purchase program, as had been widely expected. </p> <p>The FOMC then proceeded to keep investors slightly off balance by painting a much more optimistic view of the US economy that could possibly have been suggested only a couple of weeks ago, in the wake of those surprisingly dovish comments by James Bullard, about the possibility of extending QE, in the wake of concerns about Europe and a Chinese slowdown.</p> <p>Given the nature of those comments the Fed statement was as far away as it could have been from what the market had been expecting. </p> <p>As always the Fed insisted that any move on rates would be data dependant, but given some of the recent chatter from various FOMC voting and non-voting members alike the tone of the statement was all the more surprising for its hawkish tone, particularly given that there was no mention of the problems in Europe, the slowdown in China or concerns about a strong US dollar keeping inflation low. </p> </blockquote> <p>Commodity companies were among the main fallers, partly on concerns about the effects that the withdrawal of QE would have on emerging markets.</p> <p><strong>Anglo American</strong> is down 38.5p at \u00a313.14 and <strong>Randgold Resources</strong> is 120p lower at \u00a339.01.</p> <p>Troubled oil explorer <strong>Afren</strong> has fallen 6.5p to 86.75p after it said it was evaluating the need to restate some of its previous accounts following an independent review of a series of unauthorised payments. Earlier this month <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/marketforceslive/2014/oct/14/afren-dismisses-two-executives-after-discovering-unauthorised-payments\">it fired its chief executive and three other top executives after the review.</a></p> <p>The company also suffered a 35% fall in production in the nine months to the end of September, following bad weather at its Ebok oilfield and delays at its OML project, both inNigeria.</p> <p>But wealth manager <strong>St James\u2019s Place</strong> has jumped 23p to 711p after funds under management rose 17%.</p> <p><strong>Barclays</strong> has added 0.95p to 221.45p following <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/oct/30/barclays-sets-aside-500m-pay-forex-rigging-fines\">its latest update</a>, but the European banking sector has been spooked by comments Andre Enria, chairman of watchdog the European Banking Authority, that even banks which has passed the recent stress tests should not feel too secure.

But Oriel was still positive, issuing a buy note: Guidance has not changed. Even so, after today, we believe consensus forecasts will once again edge up. BT remains our top pick in the sector by far. Our recommendation is buy and our target price is 530p per share. Overall the FTSE 100 is own 45.18 points at 6408.69 ahead of US GDP figures which will be carefully studied after the Fed last night ended QE as expected but also made comments suggesting a rise in interest rates may be sooner than had been previously anticipated. Michael Hewson at CMC Markets UK said: While the Federal Reserve kept its \u201cconsiderable time\u201d [until a rate rise] phrase within yesterday\u2019s statement, that was pretty much the only dovish part of it, as the US central bank called time on its asset purchase program, as had been widely expected. The FOMC then proceeded to keep investors slightly off balance by painting a much more optimistic view of the US economy that could possibly have been suggested only a couple of weeks ago, in the wake of those surprisingly dovish comments by James Bullard, about the possibility of extending QE, in the wake of concerns about Europe and a Chinese slowdown. Given the nature of those comments the Fed statement was as far away as it could have been from what the market had been expecting. As always the Fed insisted that any move on rates would be data dependant, but given some of the recent chatter from various FOMC voting and non-voting members alike the tone of the statement was all the more surprising for its hawkish tone, particularly given that there was no mention of the problems in Europe, the slowdown in China or concerns about a strong US dollar keeping inflation low. Commodity companies were among the main fallers, partly on concerns about the effects that the withdrawal of QE would have on emerging markets. Anglo American is down 38.5p at \u00a313.14 and Randgold Resources is 120p lower at \u00a339.01. Troubled oil explorer Afren has fallen 6.5p to 86.75p after it said it was evaluating the need to restate some of its previous accounts following an independent review of a series of unauthorised payments. Earlier this month it fired its chief executive and three other top executives after the review. The company also suffered a 35% fall in production in the nine months to the end of September, following bad weather at its Ebok oilfield and delays at its OML project, both inNigeria. But wealth manager St James\u2019s Place has jumped 23p to 711p after funds under management rose 17%. Barclays has added 0.95p to 221.45p following its latest update, but the European banking sector has been spooked by comments Andre Enria, chairman of watchdog the European Banking Authority, that even banks which has passed the recent stress tests should not feel too secure. He said: The story is not over, even for the banks who passed it.",

      "bodyText": "Barclays has given an indication of the scale of potential fines looming across the banking industry by setting aside \u00a3500m to cover the cost of ongoing investigations into the rigging of currency markets. The provision is larger than the \u00a3290m the bank was fined for manipulating Libor in 2012 and has been revealed as the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) attempts to agree a settlement with six major banks over their activities in the \u00a33.5tn-a-day foreign exchange markets. The regulator hopes to reveal the outcome of its investigation and the scale of penalties next month. Royal Bank of Scotland, which reports financial results on Friday, is also part of the investigation and thought likely to have to set money aside to cover potential future penalties. The expected publication of the regulatory action next month is likely to bring with it the release of transcripts of emails and electronic chats as with the Libor scandal. Those messages included traders promising each other champagne, their names in gold letters and making quips such as \u201calways happy to help,\u201d or \u201cdone \u2026 for you big boy,\u201d after manipulating the interest rates. Tushar Morzaria, Barclays finance director, did not disclose on Thursday when any regulatory announcement might be made but said the \u00a3500m being set aside was \u201cthe best estimate [based] on the dialogue we are having with certain regulatory agencies\u201d. Barclays also reported its figures for the third quarter, in which it also took an extra \u00a3170m hit to cover the cost of payment protection insurance (PPI) mis-selling. The currency rigging fine will be the latest in a string of penalties to be imposed on Barclays \u2013 which admitted that fraud allegations made by the New York attorney general Eric Schneiderman were hurting the performance of its investment bank, where profits plunged by a third. Antony Jenkins, promoted to become boss of the bank in the wake of the Libor scandal, said the profits fall in the once dominant investment banking arm was disappointing. Some of the fall in the investment bank came in its equities operation where Schneiderman claimed in June that the bank was misleading customers about the way it had operated its \u201cdark pool system\u201d to allow specialist traders to benefit at the expense of customers. Barclays is fighting the allegations about the dark pool, a private trading system of the kind highlighted by best-selling author Michael Lewis in Flash Boys: a Wall Street Revolt. Morzaria said Barclays\u2019 market share had fallen since the allegations were made. Profits in the investment banking arm \u2013 which had grown rapidly under Jenkins\u2019s predecessor, Bob Diamond \u2013 were down 38% in the nine months to the end of September to \u00a31.3bn, although profits at the high street banking operations rose 18% to \u00a32.2bn. In the third quarter, the investment bank\u2019s profits fell more steeply, to \u00a3284m from \u00a3465m a year ago. Jenkins has set out a plan to cut 19,000 jobs as he tries to scale back the investment banking arm, which has repeatedly caused conflict with investors over the size of bonuses given to top staff. The bank has stopped publishing quarterly information about the amount of revenue being set aside to pay bonuses because it says the figures are distorted by payouts stemming from past years. About 7,000 of the job cuts were for the investment bank\u2019s 24,000-strong workforce when the overhaul was announced in May. Some 7,800 jobs have gone in the last 12 months. Profits for the entire bank for the nine months rose 5% to \u00a34.9bn when items such as a \u00a3364m loss on the sale of its troubled Spanish business are stripped out and a gain of \u00a3461m on assets relating to the Wall Street operations of Lehman Brothers \u2013 which Barclays bought in 2008 \u2013 are taken into account. On a statutory basis, the profits rose 31% to \u00a33.7bn. Barclays was able to release \u00a3160m of the \u00a31.5bn provision it has already made to cover compensation claims for small businesses mis-sold interest rate hedging products. The additional \u00a3170m provision for PPI claims takes the bank\u2019s total provision to \u00a35bn and comes after Lloyds Banking Group made a further \u00a3900m provision, taking its total bill to above \u00a311bn. The PPI scandal is the costliest ever incurred by banking industry. Barclays will pay its usual 1p quarterly dividend.",

      "standfirst": "<p>The government would have us believe they would redress any social burdens resulting from a change in the GST</p>", 
      "body": "<p>Tony Abbott\u2019s call for a \u201cmature\u201d debate about federalism and the GST should be no shock to anyone. It was on the cards the moment the May budget <a href=\"http://www.budget.gov.au/2014-15/content/overview/html/overview_07.htm\">revealed</a> that funding to the states for health and education was to be cut by $80bn from 2017-18 onwards. But while a GST may help raise more revenue, the government must address the fact that any increase in GST will hurt the poorest the most \u2013 the same households targeted in the government\u2019s first budget. </p> <p>While a mature debate is always welcome, the timing of Abbott\u2019s call is rather interesting. I guess a debate could only be had after winning office because in <a href=\"http://www.abc.net.au/news/2013-08-13/tony-abbott-reiterates-no-change-to-gst/4883414\">August last year</a>, when the (inevitable and accurate) suggestions that a Coalition government would seek to raise the GST were made, Tony Abbott responded by pledging, \u201clet me be as categoric as I can. The GST won\u2019t change, full stop, end of story.\u201d</p> <p>Not so much the end of the story as an intermission, it seems. </p> <p>So was a mature debate on the carbon price or the mining tax never needed while Abbott was in opposition? </p> <p>Similarly, we can dismiss calls by the prime minister, such as those he made in a speech to the <a href=\"http://www.pm.gov.au/media/2014-10-28/address-business-council-australia-annual-dinner-sydney\">Business Council of Australia</a> when he invited \u201cthe Labor party, the state governments to join Team Australia and think of our country and not just the next election\u201d as pure political posturing.</p> <p>Tony Abbott was certainly thinking about the next election last August, and given that he is using the moronic work-shopped term \u201cTeam Australia\u201d, which previously had only applied to national security, it\u2019s abundantly clear he continues now to think only of the next election. </p> <p>His calls for bipartisanship on terrorism seem to have shifted to a call for the same bipartisanship on economic issues. </p> <p>But this hypocrisy and politicisation is not reason enough to dismiss the debate about the GST, neither is it the only problem the government needs to counter.</p> <p>It must also prosecute Tony Abbott\u2019s assertion that he believes in \u201clower, simpler, fairer taxes\u201d. For low taxes are not necessarily fairer, neither are simpler ones, and fairness does not end with taxation \u2013 indeed it is just the start. </p> <p>And given the government\u2019s first budget was <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/grogonomics/2014/oct/13/whichever-way-you-cut-it-the-federal-budget-hurts-the-poorest-hardest\">overwhelmingly</a> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/grogonomics/2014/may/08/family-tax-benefit-cuts-will-hurt-ordinary-australians-more-than-a-levy\">targeted</a> at <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/grogonomics/2014/may/15/a-more-divided-and-unequal-australia-where-this-government-is-taking-us\">hurting </a> poorer households over wealthier ones, it appears that when the prime minister talks about fairness he\u2019s not talking about equality. </p> <p>I have <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/grogonomics/2013/aug/15/gst-forever-too-long\">written</a> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/grogonomics/2013/sep/27/grogonomics-gst-tax-mix\">a</a> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/dec/05/festive-season-but-federal-government-has-little-appetite-for-lowering-gst-bar\">number</a> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/grogonomics/2014/feb/06/paying-gst-education-unpopular-but-progressive\">of times</a> that we need to discuss changing the GST. Indirect taxes such as the GST are generally regarded as more efficient than income tax. But what you gain in efficiency you lose in equality. </p> <p>Regardless of what you earn, you pay the same amount of GST on an item. And because poorer people spend more of their income on goods and services than do wealthier people, a GST is invariably regressive \u2013 it hurts you more the less you earn. </p> <p>There are two ways to change the GST. The first is to just raise it. But this does nothing to make it simpler. The <a href=\"https://www.ato.gov.au/business/gst/in-detail/your-industry/food/gst-food-guide/?anchor=GSTstatusoffooditems#GSTstatusoffooditems\">exemptions for certain foods</a> would remain. It would also fail to alleviate the fact that we now spend more of our income on goods and services not covered by the GST than we did when it was introduced.</p> <p>So any reform to the GST must involve broadening its base by including items such as fresh food, water and sewerage, and health and education expenses. </p> <p>But the most recent household income and expenditure data, released <a href=\"http://www.abs.gov.au/AUSSTATS/abs@.nsf/Lookup/5204.0.55.011Main+Features12003-04%20to%202011-12?OpenDocument\">earlier this month</a>, shows that lower income households spend more of their income on these items than wealthier households do: </p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"graph 1\">  <iframe src=\"https://charts.datawrapper.de/FhXv5/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>Only on education expenses do wealthier households spend about the same of their income as median income households. But for all other items \u2013 food, water and sewerage, and health \u2013 including them within the GST would automatically make life harder for poorer households. </p> <p>The data even shows us that single parents and pensioners would easily suffer more than other types of households:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"graph 2\">  <iframe src=\"https://charts.datawrapper.de/JADH0/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>The only way to alleviate this is by reducing income tax and/or increasing welfare.</p> <p>This is tricky because currently our tax and welfare system has an important role in reducing inequality:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"graph 3\">  <iframe src=\"https://charts.datawrapper.de/R4dGK/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>The wealthiest quintile (20%) of households receive 46.2% of all household income compared with just 4% going to the poorest quintile. But after counting welfare such as pensions, family tax benefits and unemployment benefits, the poorest quintile has 6.9% of total income, with 42% going to the richest. </p> <p>Once taxes are taken out, because the wealthiest pay more of their income in tax, their share of income falls to 39.1%, while the poorest quintile has 7.7%. </p> <p>So income tax and welfare are vital to redistributing income to ensure some degree of equality. Yet it is this precise area that Joe Hockey and Tony Abbott have targeted with their suggestions that people on welfare are leaners.</p> <p>And taxation and welfare is not where the story ends.

      "bodyText": "Tony Abbott\u2019s call for a \u201cmature\u201d debate about federalism and the GST should be no shock to anyone. It was on the cards the moment the May budget revealed that funding to the states for health and education was to be cut by $80bn from 2017-18 onwards. But while a GST may help raise more revenue, the government must address the fact that any increase in GST will hurt the poorest the most \u2013 the same households targeted in the government\u2019s first budget. While a mature debate is always welcome, the timing of Abbott\u2019s call is rather interesting. I guess a debate could only be had after winning office because in August last year, when the (inevitable and accurate) suggestions that a Coalition government would seek to raise the GST were made, Tony Abbott responded by pledging, \u201clet me be as categoric as I can. The GST won\u2019t change, full stop, end of story.\u201d Not so much the end of the story as an intermission, it seems. So was a mature debate on the carbon price or the mining tax never needed while Abbott was in opposition? Similarly, we can dismiss calls by the prime minister, such as those he made in a speech to the Business Council of Australia when he invited \u201cthe Labor party, the state governments to join Team Australia and think of our country and not just the next election\u201d as pure political posturing. Tony Abbott was certainly thinking about the next election last August, and given that he is using the moronic work-shopped term \u201cTeam Australia\u201d, which previously had only applied to national security, it\u2019s abundantly clear he continues now to think only of the next election. His calls for bipartisanship on terrorism seem to have shifted to a call for the same bipartisanship on economic issues. But this hypocrisy and politicisation is not reason enough to dismiss the debate about the GST, neither is it the only problem the government needs to counter. It must also prosecute Tony Abbott\u2019s assertion that he believes in \u201clower, simpler, fairer taxes\u201d. For low taxes are not necessarily fairer, neither are simpler ones, and fairness does not end with taxation \u2013 indeed it is just the start. And given the government\u2019s first budget was overwhelmingly targeted at hurting poorer households over wealthier ones, it appears that when the prime minister talks about fairness he\u2019s not talking about equality. I have written a number of times that we need to discuss changing the GST. Indirect taxes such as the GST are generally regarded as more efficient than income tax. But what you gain in efficiency you lose in equality. Regardless of what you earn, you pay the same amount of GST on an item. And because poorer people spend more of their income on goods and services than do wealthier people, a GST is invariably regressive \u2013 it hurts you more the less you earn. There are two ways to change the GST. The first is to just raise it. But this does nothing to make it simpler. The exemptions for certain foods would remain. It would also fail to alleviate the fact that we now spend more of our income on goods and services not covered by the GST than we did when it was introduced. So any reform to the GST must involve broadening its base by including items such as fresh food, water and sewerage, and health and education expenses. But the most recent household income and expenditure data, released earlier this month, shows that lower income households spend more of their income on these items than wealthier households do: Only on education expenses do wealthier households spend about the same of their income as median income households. But for all other items \u2013 food, water and sewerage, and health \u2013 including them within the GST would automatically make life harder for poorer households. The data even shows us that single parents and pensioners would easily suffer more than other types of households: The only way to alleviate this is by reducing income tax and/or increasing welfare. This is tricky because currently our tax and welfare system has an important role in reducing inequality: The wealthiest quintile (20%) of households receive 46.2% of all household income compared with just 4% going to the poorest quintile. But after counting welfare such as pensions, family tax benefits and unemployment benefits, the poorest quintile has 6.9% of total income, with 42% going to the richest. Once taxes are taken out, because the wealthiest pay more of their income in tax, their share of income falls to 39.1%, while the poorest quintile has 7.7%. So income tax and welfare are vital to redistributing income to ensure some degree of equality. Yet it is this precise area that Joe Hockey and Tony Abbott have targeted with their suggestions that people on welfare are leaners. And taxation and welfare is not where the story ends. Public services like education and health provide households with what is called \u201csocial transfers in kind\u201d. For example, when you get education at a public school you receive a service that is worth the money you would otherwise have had to pay. Not surprisingly, the poorest households get more services than the richest. Once these are taken into account, the wealthiest quintile of households receives 34.5% of total income and the poorest quintile now gets a 10.8% share of total income. And most of the work redistributing income is done through these social transfers: The poorest 20% of households get on average $20,970 a year from direct benefits, but $27,237 from social transfers in kind. And yet, just as with direct benefits, the Abbott government has targeted health and education spending either by cutting it or by attempting to introduce payments such as the GP co-payment \u2013 all of which reduces the social transfer amount. The Coalition argues the GST needs to be reformed in order to pay for health and education expenditure, except it was also the Coalition that announced it was cutting these expenditures too. It has also announced it will abandon the needs-based education funding model that reduces inequality in that social transfer. The federation might need fixing and the GST should be examined, but the impact of GST changes on equality, as well as on the efficiency of the tax system, must be considered. For the past 12 months the government has attacked the poorest households for accessing welfare, for being unemployed, for being on disability support pensions and for using services such as health care without paying up-front for them. Now the government would have us believe they would change the GST and use welfare and social services to redress any added burdens? Sorry, but you can\u2019t just talk about fairness in a speech and think we\u2019ll forget all your actions.",
