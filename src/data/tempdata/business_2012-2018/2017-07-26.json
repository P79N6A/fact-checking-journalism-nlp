      "bodyText": "Ten years on the housing market is still feeling the after-effects of the credit crunch, with existing homeowners struggling to trade up, a doubling of typical first-time buyer deposits, and a \u201chuge gap\u201d between London and the rest of Britain, according to a new report. Property company Savills has found that the global financial crisis \u2013 which it considers to have started on 9 August 2007, when the French bank BNP Paribas froze three investment funds \u2013 is \u201cstill shaping the UK housing market\u201d and will continue to cast its shadow over the sector for years to come. In the report, the firm says the property market is \u201cmore divided at a regional level than ever before\u201d. Over the past decade, London price growth has been twice that of the south-east and at least four times that of all other regions. The average house price now stands at \u00a3478,142 in London, compared with the UK average of \u00a3209,971, the report says. By contrast, Wales, Yorkshire and Humberside, and the north-west have only just achieved positive price growth 10 years post-credit crunch, while values in the north-east are typically down 9%, according to the firm\u2019s analysis of data from the Land Registry and other sources. The report also identifies a \u201cdramatic slump\u201d in spending and transactions. A total of \u00a3312bn was spent on house purchases in the year to the end of March 2017 \u2013 \u00a330bn less than the figure for 2007. Meanwhile, the amount of mortgage lending where the borrower is putting down a deposit of under 10% has reduced to less than one-fifth of the \u00a352bn in 2007. This category of lending now represents only 3.9% of the total, whereas in 2007 it was more than 14%. Homebuyers now need bigger deposits. The average deposit raised by a UK first-time buyer has more than doubled to \u00a326,224, although in London it has more than quadrupled, rising from \u00a321,196 a decade ago to \u00a397,513 now. First-time buyer deposits totalled \u00a310.2bn in the year to the end of March 2017 \u2013 up 85% on 10 years ago, the report says. Savills estimates that more than \u00a34bn of this came from either \u201cthe bank of mum and dad\u201d or government schemes such as help to buy. Fewer homeowners are able to climb the property ladder. In 2007, one in 15 existing homeowners moved house, a figure that has fallen to one in 27 in 2017. \u201cLong gone are the days when interest-only borrowing would allow homeowners to make frequent moves up the ladder. Over one in three mortgages in 2007 were interest-only \u2013 some 343,200 \u2013 but they have now all but disappeared, down to just 8,000 in the past year,\u201d Savills says. A separate report also released on Thursday claims that only 37% of homes put on the market in London are actually selling, providing further evidence of a slowdown in the property market. The HomeOwners Alliance analysed estate agents\u2019 listings and housing transactions, finding that, in May 2017, 55% of all properties listed resulted in a successful sale, compared with 59% a year ago. The other 45% were either taken off the market by the seller or simply remained listed. However, the picture in London is \u201ceven bleaker\u201d, according to the alliance, as only 37.3% of listings resulted in a sale, compared with 48.3% in May last year. Properties that are selling are also taking longer to do so. A year ago, homes in the capital stayed on the market for an average of 56.6 days each, but now it takes agents an average of 72 days to agree a sale. And in May 2016, properties in London were achieving an average of 98.1% of their asking price, but a year later that figure had slipped to 95.8%.",

      "bodyText": "National Grid has welcomed the plan to make electric or zero-emission cars and vans account for all new sales from 2040, but said the government and industry now faced big decisions on how the extra power was provided and demand for it was managed. The grid recently warned that, by 2030, electric cars could require 3.5-8GW of additional capacity, on top of the current peak demand of 60GW. By comparison, the nuclear power station being built at Hinkley Point in Somerset will add 3.2GW of capacity to the system. By the middle of the century, when it is assumed almost all cars will be electric, that extra peak demand could be up to 18GW. The lowest estimates of extra demand assume that drivers charge their cars at off-peak times. Smart meters and time-of-day tariffs could incentivise owners to charge when wind and solar power are plentiful and electricity is cheaper. Energy networks could also manage demand via automatic time-shift charging, whereby a car plugged in at home at 6pm is not actually charged until the early hours of the morning, when demand is low. Ministers have already urged drivers to think carefully and avoid placing extra pressure on the grid. James Court, head of policy at the Renewable Energy Association, a trade group, said: \u201cWe need smart vehicle charging and price-reflective tariffs if the future electric fleet is to be a huge benefit and not a hindrance to our grid.\u201d Regardless of how sensibly the extra demand is spread across the day, electric cars will require investment in new power generation. The energy analyst Wood Mackenzie estimates that if one in three cars sold in 2035 is fully electric, the vehicles would collectively account for 3% of the UK\u2019s total electricity demand. Building 400,000 charging points for them all would cost \u00a330bn, the group has said. National Grid said the extra power would be generated from gas, windfarms, imports and nuclear reactors \u2013 not from coal, which is scheduled to disappear from the UK\u2019s power mix by 2025 at the latest. And the switch to electric vehicles could even provide an eventual boost to the grid. The government recently announced \u00a320m of funding to support research on vehicle-to-grid technology, where the grid could call on the power stored in the cars\u2019 batteries to help cope with fluctuations from intermittent wind and solar farms.",

    "webTitle": "New 'experimental' data shows an increase in people working two jobs | Greg Jericho", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "A release of new, experimental, data on the labour sector by the Australian Bureau of Statistics has revealed that in the past five years the percentage of people working two jobs has increased by more than the number of people gaining employment. Quite often when the monthly labour force figures come out, they are reported as recording the number of jobs rising or falling. But the number of employed persons does not equal jobs. The biggest reason for the difference is that some people work more than one job. In the labour force figures, all that matters is whether or not you are employed. If last month you had one job and this month you have two, you were classed as \u201cemployed\u201d in both months. If this month however your two jobs meant you worked more than 35 hours a week, you would now be classed as in \u201cfull-time employment\u201d \u2013 even though you were actually working in two part-time jobs. The confusion also extends to differences of counting. The labour force figures only count people over the age of 15, whereas a 14 year old working part-time in a shop for example would not be counted. Similarly while an advertised job is not currently employing anyone, that is a job that is available. Thus, the total number of jobs in the economy at any one time is a sum of the number of main jobs, the number of secondary jobs (\u201cjobs filled\u201d) and the number of advertised jobs. The employment figures however only count the number of main jobs. Another problem is that data about jobs comes from businesses, whereas data about employment comes from households \u2013 and the two don\u2019t always line up. For example, the labour force survey in June 2016 had 11.9 million people employed, whereas business surveys done by the ABS suggested there were 12.9 million jobs. The ABS is attempting to reconcile these differences. This week, for the first time, it released a \u201cLabour Account\u201d which attempts to put all the different surveys into some sort of synch. Currently it is only an annual report, however the chief economist of the ABS, Bruce Hockman, hopes that within a couple years it will be released quarterly \u2013 the week after the GDP figures come out. One of the best new aspects of the labour account is the ability to differentiate between \u201cmain job\u201d and \u201csecondary job\u201d growth. The figures shows that since 2010-11, the number of people employed grew by 6.79%, but the number of jobs filled grew by 6.92%. The reason for the difference is that the number of secondary jobs grew by 9.2%. The big surge in secondary jobs came in 2014-15 and 2015-16. In those two years the number of people working a second job grew by more than 3.5%: In those two years, secondary jobs accounted for 10% of the increase in jobs \u2013 a figure that saw the percentage of people working at least two jobs rise from 5.9% in 2012-13 to 6.1%: Now we should not go overboard in decrying this state of affairs. In essence that means there are around 32,000 people working in second jobs than would have been the case if the ratio had stayed the same. The figures also don\u2019t tell us why those people took a second job \u2013 whether their main job reduced hours, or they needed to take a second job because the pay in their main job (which may be part-time as well) was not enough to pay for the rising cost of essentials. The new data also lets us know which industries have the highest proportion of secondary jobs. Not surprisingly, industries with high proportions of part-time employed have the highest numbers of people working a second job. Just over 16% of people working in the administration and supply industry have a second job. The biggest disparity between the proportion of secondary jobs and part-time employed is in the retail industry. While it has the second highest number of part-time employees in any industry, there are fewer people working in the retail industry as a second job than is the case across all industries: Generally there is a good relationship between the growth of main and secondary jobs in each industry, although in the five years to 2015-16 the real estate industry saw a massive jump in people working in the industry as a second job: In 2010-11, 4.9% of people in the real estate industry were doing it as a second job, by 2015-16 this was up to 6.1%. The figures also give some new insight into underemployment. Because the new figures look at the amount of hours willing to be worked by both unemployed and those who are already working, we are able to determine the labour supply, not just by numbers of people, but also by the amount of hours. The data shows that while the percent of total hours available to be worked that were not being worked fell in 2015-16, the share of those hours by underemployed workers grew: This was off the back of 2014-15 which saw a huge spike in the amount of hours sought by underemployed workers: In an environment in which there is often much confusion and complaint about the unemployment figures, these newest, experimental figures released by the ABS will serve us well. In time it will give us more information on the changing nature of our labour force. For now, it appears there has been an increase of people working two jobs but the data relates to events that occurred 12 months ago. In time, hopefully, the data will become more recent, allowing policymakers to respond with more information at hand than they presently have available.",

    "webTitle": "Hammond admits UK consumers hurt by pound's fall as GDP grows by 0.3%", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Philip Hammond has admitted that consumers are suffering from the pound\u2019s sharp post-referendum fall, after what government statisticians have called a \u201cnotable slowdown\u201d in growth in the first half of the year. The economy grew by just 0.3% in the second quarter of 2017 following 0.2% expansion in the first three months of the year, Office for National Statistics figures showed. The chancellor, who says businesses and households are being affected by the lack of clarity about Brexit, put the sharp easing of growth in the past six months down to the squeeze on the cost of living caused by dearer imports. \u201cConsumers are being affected by the inflation that was created by the depreciation of the currency in the autumn of last year. That will pass through the economy, but I absolutely recognise it\u2019s painful as it\u2019s passing through the economy,\u201d Hammond said in an interview with ITV News. The expansion in the three months to June was in line with City expectations that the weakness of the economy meant no chance of an increase in interest rates by the Bank of England next week. Official data for gross domestic product showed that of the three big sectors of the economy, only services were bigger at the end of June than in March. Services, which account for almost 80% of the economy\u2019s output, posted growth of 0.5% over the quarter. Industrial production, which includes manufacturing, fell by 0.4%, while construction was down by 0.9%. When adjusted for a rising population, Britain\u2019s economic growth came to a virtual standstill in the first half of 2017. Growth per head was up 0.1% in the second quarter after being flat in the first quarter. Over the year since the Brexit vote, GDP per head has risen by 1% and is only 1.9% higher than it was before the economy plunged into recession in early 2008. Darren Morgan, head of national accounts at the Office for National Statistics, said: \u201cThe economy has experienced a notable slowdown in the first half of this year. While services such as retail, and film production and distribution showed some improvement in the second quarter, a weaker performance from construction and manufacturing pulled down overall growth.\u201d The economy confounded predictions that it would plunge into recession after the EU referendum last June, posting stronger growth in the second half of 2016 than in the first half. The fall in the value of the pound has pushed up inflation and made life tougher for consumers since the turn of the year. Retail activity was the biggest single contributor to growth in the second quarter but this followed a fall in the first quarter. The ONS said spending in the shops and online was broadly flat in the first half of the year. The ONS said the film industry played a significant role in the modest rise in GDP from the first quarter, adding almost 0.1 percentage points to growth. A spokesman said the boost to film production was the biggest factor, but added that ticket sales for Wonder Woman and the latest in the Pirates of the Caribbean franchise also played a part. Despite buoyant survey evidence, the hard economic data from the ONS showed manufacturing was struggling. UK factories saw production fall by 0.5% during the second quarter, largely due to a drop in motor vehicle output. In the year to the second quarter, the economy grew by 1.7%, down from 1.9% in the first quarter. John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, said: \u201cToday\u2019s GDP figures reveal weak growth under a weak government, and expose the last seven years of Tory economic failure. \u201cGrowth for the first half of 2017 is below expectations, and it follows continued data showing working families are being squeezed with wages not keeping up with prices. The truth is that the Tories\u2019 austerity cuts have undermined working people\u2019s living standards and weakened the UK economy.\u201d Chris Williamson, the chief business economist at IHS Markit, said: \u201cThese meagre growth rates indicate that the economy has lost momentum in 2017, and will consequently fail to achieve the 1.8% expansion seen in 2016. \u201cThe second quarter growth was below the 0.4% expansion anticipated by the Bank of England, and therefore suggests we will see the central bank revise down its forecasts for the economy next week from the 1.9% growth it has currently penciled in.",

European indices ended in the red, even as Wall Street hit new peaks ahead of the latest US Federal Reserve meeting. There is little expectation of any excitement from the Fed, however. Joshua Mahony, market analyst at IG, said: This afternoon sees investors focus on the latest appearance from Yellen and co, at what promises to be a relatively uneventful meeting by historical standards. With the Fed Funds rate showing a 0% chance of a rate rise, and little chance of a balance sheet reduction being announced today, it is the linguistics which really matter. With no press conference from Yellen to contend with, markets will be keeping a close eye out for any mention within the accompanying statement of a potential September balance sheet reduction, alongside any reference to recent inflation disappointment. The final scores in Europe showed: The FTSE 100 finished 17.5 points or 0.24% higher at 7452.32 Germany\u2019s Dax rose 0.33% to 12,305.11 France\u2019s Cac closed up 0.56% to 5190.17 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB added 0.56% to 21,577.56 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended up 0.49% at 10,575.4 But in Greece, the Athens market fell 1.52% to 830.21 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 99 points or 0.46%. On that note, it\u2019s time to close for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. Late news from the UK banking sector. The UK and European Union have agreed a deal to avert state aid issues surrounding Royal Bank of Scotland\u2019s Williams &amp; Glyn business. PA explains: Royal Bank of Scotland is likely to avoid the compulsory sale of its Williams &amp; Glyn branches by doling out \u00a3835m to help boost competition among UK banks It follows a joint review by the European Commission (EC) and HM Treasury, which have put forward the \u201calternative remedies package\u201d that will help fulfil RBS\u2019s state aid obligations following its Government bailout at the height of the financial crisis. The package includes plans for a \u00a3425m fund aimed at competitors across the UK\u2019s banking and fintech sector, as well as a \u00a3350m pot meant to help challenger banks convince small and medium sized business - which were previously Williams &amp; Glyn customers - to switch accounts and loans from RBS. RBS will shell out an another \u00a360m to cover additional costs, which will help cover the proposal\u2019s implementation. The proposal, which still requires approval by the EC\u2019s College of Commissioners, will save RBS from hiving off the near-300 Williams &amp; Glyn branches, having struggled to find a buyer ahead of its deadline which was set for the end of 2017. A decision by the College of Commissioners that could cement the terms of the proposal is expected in the second half of the year. Here\u2019s Reuters on the jump in the oil price following the US crude stock figures: Oil prices rose to near eight-week highs on Wednesday, with Brent crude futures at over $50 a barrel, as a fall in U.S. inventories bolstered expectations that the long-oversupplied market was moving toward balance... U.S. crude stocks fell last week as refineries hiked output and imports dropped, while gasoline stocks decreased and distillate inventories fell, the Energy Information Administration said on Wednesday. Crude inventories fell 7.2 million barrels in the week ending July 21, more than the expected decrease of 2.6 million barrels. The decline was the fourth consecutive drop, giving support to the market. This added to hopes a long-awaited rebalancing was underway in the oil market. Saudi Arabia said on Monday it would limit oil exports to 6.6 million barrels per day (bpd) in August, down nearly 1 million bpd from a year earlier. \u201cToday\u2019s report has strengthened the bullish sentiment already prevailing in the market, although the longevity of the move remains in doubt,\u201d said Abhishek Kumar, Senior Energy Analyst at Interfax Energy\u2019s Global Gas Analytics in London. \u201cNevertheless, the country\u2019s crude and gasoline stockpiles remain above their five-year averages, which will cap price gains.\u201d The drawdown was a combination of higher exports from the United States, marginal decline in oil output and a rise in the refinery utilization rate, he said... But analysts said the current oil price rally could encourage more production, particularly from the United States. \u201cRelieved bulls should be careful what they wish for. Any price rebound will only embolden U.S. shale producers at a time when rumours have started to emerge that the U.S. shale boom is slowing,\u201d PVM oil analyst Stephen Brennock said in a note. Oil prices, already on the rise on signs that recent output cuts could be having an effect, have gained more ground after a bigger than expected weekly fall in US crude stocks. Crude inventories fell by 7.21m last week to 483.42m barrels, much higher than the forecast 2.6m decline, according to the Energy Information Administration. Gasoline stocks fell by 1.02m barrels compared to the expected 0.6m barrel drop. So Brent crude, up around 0.18% at $50.29 a barrel ahead of the US figures, jumped 1.5% to $50.94. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said: Just as this afternoon looked like it was going to settle into some traditional pre-Fed dreariness the Dow Jones surged to a fresh all-time high off the back of a decent set of earnings. Boeing ended-up being the stock to spark the Dow\u2019s lift-off, the jet maker surging more than 8% after beating EPS estimates and raising its full year guidance. This helped the US index rise by 110 or so points after the bell, taking it above 21700 for the first time in its history (for those keeping track, that\u2019s roughly 3300 points gained since Trump won the election last November). And that, of course, is not all for the US markets, with July\u2019s Federal Reserve meeting still to come. Though the central bank has done a lot to reduce rate hike expectations to effectively zero for this month \u2013 the CME FedWatch tool has the chances of a move at just 3.1% \u2013 investors will be keen to see whether Yellen and co. tee up an autumn or winter increase. US home sales came slightly below forecast last month. June single family home sales rose 0.8% to 0.610m units, compared to expectations of a figure of 0.615m. The May figure was revised down from 0.610m to 0.605m. The median sale price fell 3.4% to $310,800. A raft of positive company results, including Boeing and AT&amp;T, has pushed Wall Street to new record levels. The Dow Jones Industrial Average hit a new peak of 21,711 shortly after the market opened, while the Nasdaq Composite rose 0.22% and the S&amp;P 500 0.12% to record levels. Chancellor Philip Hammond has been speaking to Sky about the UK economy: There is a degree of uncertainty aound the UK economy in particular because businesses and consumers are looking for clarity about what our future relationship with the European Union will be. That\u2019s why we attach importance to as early as possible agreeing what the interim arrangements will look like as we leave the European Union in March 2019 and move to a long term different kind of arrangement with the EU. The earlier we can get agreement on transitional arragnements the greater clarity business and consumers will have. So that\u2019s definitely the first port of call..in removing some of this uncertainty. I think the right way to go forward is to preserve some headroom within our fiscal rules so that if the economy starts to slow we have the ability to respond and support it, but to be very clear that our intention is to get back to living within our means.... to balance the budget by 2025 and make steady progress to doing that. Graham Toy, chief executive officer of the National Association of Commercial Finance Brokers, is relatively upbeat about the GDP figures, all things considered, but is worried about rising consumer credit. He says: The economy isn\u2019t firing on all cylinders but neither is it out for the count. In fact, faced with such political uncertainty, the economy is proving to be remarkably resilient. The one concern is that the service sector continues to prop up this growth, fuelled by consumers\u2019 ready access to credit. The upbeat performance of the services sector has helped to offset falls in industrial output and construction. The Bank of England\u2019s warning shot over spiralling consumer credit could well end up damaging this relatively rosy outlook in the coming months. While the Bank\u2019s response to rising consumer debt is understandable, the economy - as well as consumer and business confidence - would benefit from a controlled approach to bringing consumer spending under control. Sterling has taken today\u2019s UK growth report in its stride. The pound is up 0.3% against the euro at \u20ac1.1208, and 0.2% higher against the US dollar at $1.305 - broadly unchanged since the GDP data hit the wires. Shares are up too, with the FTSE 100 gaining 32 points to 7466. That\u2019s not too surprising, given the City had expected growth of 0.3% in Q2. Fawad Razaqzada of Forex.com says. The pound didn\u2019t show any positive reaction in the immediate aftermath of the data release as the number was bang in line with the expectations. Yet equally, the sellers had little desire to show up. Britain\u2019s economy is currently running some way below its potential, according to this chart from the National Institute of Economic and Social Research. NIESR Director Jagjit Chadha says growth may remain sluggish through 2017. The economy will probably continue to perform at sub-par levels and this importantly this implies only a minor improvement in income per head this year, which is a better measure of welfare than GDP alone. Indeed there are signs that for many households consumption will be crimped as the year progresses with a fall in real disposable income and credit availability drying up\u201d. We don\u2019t yet know how Britain\u2019s performance compares to its rivals. The UK is the second major nation to report second-quarter growth figures after China, which grew by an annual rate of 6.9% [roughly a quarterly rate of 1.7%]. French GDP is being released on Friday morning, and expected to grow by around 0.5%. Here\u2019s economics editor Larry Elliott\u2019s take on today\u2019s GDP report: Britain\u2019s economy grew by just 0.3% in the second quarter of 2017 after what government statisticians called a \u201cnotable slowdown\u201d in the first half of the year. The expansion in the three months to June followed 0.2% growth in the first quarter and was in line with City expectations for the eagerly awaited first estimate of the economy\u2019s recent performance. Official data for gross domestic product showed that of the three big sectors of the economy, only services were bigger at the end of June than in March, posting growth of 0.5% over the quarter. Industrial production, which includes manufacturing, fell by 0.4%, while construction was down by 0.9%. Darren Morgan, head of national accounts at the Office for National Statistics, said: \u201cThe economy has experienced a notable slowdown in the first half of this year. While services such as retail, and film production and distribution showed some improvement in the second quarter, a weaker performance from construction and manufacturing pulled down overall growth.\u201d... More here: This chart underlines how the service sector has driven UK growth for years. And this one shows how retail and motion pictures provided the biggest spur to growth..... Although Britain\u2019s economy is growing, it would be growing rather faster without the disruption and uncertainty created by Brexit. So says Kallum Pickering, senior UK economist at Berenberg bank: Since the Lehman recession, the UK has sat comfortably at the top of the G7 growth league. But whereas growth has accelerated significantly so far this year in continental Europe and many emerging markets, the UK is missing out. While the downside risks from the Brexit vote have not yet played out in a major way, the uncertainty stemming from Brexit is leading to caution in all areas of spending and policy that have long-term implications. The UK would probably be growing at 2.5% or above this year were it not for Brexit, with strong gains in real wages and more business investment. We forecast real GDP growth of 1.6% in 2018 and 1.7% in 2019. Experienced City analyst George Magnus warns that Britain is vulnerable if the global economy falters: Ian Kernohan, economist at Royal London Asset Management, predicts that the weak growth means the Bank of England will leave interest rates at record lows next month: We expect the Bank to keep policy unchanged until we have greater clarity on what is happening to underlying inflationary pressures in the labour market.\u201d Charles Hepworth, investment director at Swiss investment group GAM, says the outlook for the UK is murkier than some people expect: Growth would have been expected to be negatively impacted by the political shocks which came part way through the quarter with the unexpected General Election result and the associated currency weakness affecting the domestic inflation picture. The Office for National Statistics noted that the UK experienced \u201ca notable slowdown\u201d in the first half of the year, reflective of the continuing uncertainty surrounding the Brexit process. This follows on from the IMF earlier this week cutting its 2017 growth forecast for the UK to 1.7% from 2%. The outlook isn\u2019t as rosy as some suggest and affirms our cautious view on UK assets, particularly domestic equities and sterling. Rain Newton-Smith, the CBI\u2019s Chief Economist, says Britain\u2019s economic growth \u201cremained sluggish\u201d in the last three months. Worryingly, she expects this to continue for a while....and is urging the government to negotiate a \u2018transition\u2019 deal to help companies after the UK leaves the EU. Newton-Smith says: We expect growth to remain lukewarm over the next couple of years, so providing businesses with certainty and stability has never been more important. \u201cA limited transition period as we leave the EU where the UK stays in the single market and a customs union until a final deal is in force, would help create a bridge to a new trading arrangement. It would give businesses the confidence they need to invest, expand and create jobs.\u201d This table shows how the UK service sector drove growth in the last quarter, while industrial production and construction shrank: On a per-capita basis, UK GDP rose by only 0.1% in the last quarter. In other words, if you adjust for population changes, Britain\u2019s economy barely grew at all. Political reaction to the GDP figures is coming in now. Philip Hammond, Chancellor of the Exchequer, points out that the economy is still growing.... \u201cOur economy has grown continuously for four and a half years, delivering record levels of employment. We can be proud of that; but we are not complacent. We need to focus on restoring productivity growth to deliver higher wages and living standards for people across the country. That is why we are committed to investing in infrastructure, technology and skills to deliver the best possible base for strong future growth.\u201d But John McDonnell MP, Labour\u2019s Shadow Chancellor, is alarmed that UK growth since January is the weakest since 2012. McDonnell says: \u201cToday\u2019s GDP figures reveal weak growth under a weak government, and expose the last seven years of Tory economic failure. \u201cGrowth for the first half of 2017 is below expectations, and it follows continued data showing working families are being squeezed with wages not keeping up with prices. \u201cThe truth is that the Tories\u2019 austerity cuts have undermined working people\u2019s living standards and weakened the UK economy. \u201cOnly a Labour Government has a strategic plan of investment to boost growth, underpinned by our Fiscal Credibility Rule; which will help build a high wage, high skill economy that works for the many not the few.\u201d Ranko Berich, Head of Market Analysis at Monex Europe, says the overall picture of the UK economy this year is \u201cgrim\u201d compared to 2016. And that means there\u2019s little room for the Bank of England to consider raising interest rates. Berich says: \u201cDespite frothy optimism in sector survey data, manufacturing failed to make a positive contribution to GDP growth, but if the latest surveys are to be believed this may change in the second half of the year. \u201cThe main takeaways from today\u2019s figures are that the UK economy continues to live and die by the consumer, and the business investment pickup hoped for by the Bank of England has not yet materialised. The BoE has been making some hawkish noises lately, but data like these mean the MPC would need to be very confident indeed about investment picking up in the immediate future to hike rates.\u201d Britain\u2019s film industry has played a significant role in the modest growth in GDP in the last three months. An ONS spokesman said boost to film production was the biggest factor, though he was unable to give details of specific films that had contributed to the industry\u2019s output in recent months. Underlying the continued attraction of the big screen, he said the success of cinema ticket sales for Wonder Woman and the latest in the Pirates of the Caribbean franchise also played a part. Recent tax credit changes have also made the UK a more attractive prospect for production companies. As this chart shows, Britain\u2019s motion picture and publishing sector has significantly outpaced the European Union average since 2014: On the upside, this is the 18th quarter of growth in a row. But on the downside, Britain has now recorded its weakest six months of growth since 2012. Growth is \u201cclearly becoming harder to come by\u201d in the UK, says Nancy Curtin, chief investment officer at Close Brothers Asset Management. Curtin adds: The competitive pound has boosted exports, as has increasing global demand. However, weakening consumer spending power is a real concern. The lack of real-terms wage inflation also continues to drag, as does low productivity. What\u2019s more, companies still do not have clarity on the nature of Brexit, which is impeding long-term investment decisions. Guardian Business has launched a daily email. Besides the key news headlines that you\u2019d expect, there\u2019s an at-a-glance agenda of the day\u2019s main events, insightful opinion pieces and a quality feature to sink your teeth into each day. For your morning shot of financial news, sign up here: There\u2019s scant evidence that Britain\u2019s economy has rebalanced during the last three months. While the service sector grew by 0.5%, manufacturing output actually contracted by 0.5% during the quarter. That\u2019s mainly due to a fall in production of motor vehicles. Britain\u2019s economy is now 9% above its pre-downturn peak, says the ONS. Today\u2019s report shows that Britain\u2019s economy has experienced a \u201c a notable slowdown in the first half of this year\u201d, says ONS Head of National Accounts Darren Morgan said: That\u2019s because GDP only grew by 0.2% in January-to-March, and then by 0.3% in April-to-June - both below the long-term growth trend. Morgan explains: \u201cWhile services such as retail, and film production and distribution showed some improvement in the second quarter, a weaker performance from construction and manufacturing pulled down overall growth.\u201d Today\u2019s figures also show that the UK economy has expanded by 1.7% over the last 12 months, down from 2% three months ago. Britain\u2019s service sector drove the economy in the last quarter, with output rising by 0.5%. But, as feared, industrial output shrank by 0.4% and construction contracted by 0.9%. BREAKING: Britain\u2019s economy grew by 0.3% in the second quarter of 2017. That\u2019s up from 0.2% in the first quarter, and in line with City forecasts. More to follow... The tension is building.... The pound is creeping higher as City traders get ready for the growth figures in 20 minutes time. Sterling has gained 0.3% against the euro, to \u20ac1.12. It\u2019s also a little higher against the US dollar, at $1.303. You\u2019d expect the pound to rally if GDP is stronger than expected, and slide if the data is disappointing. Andy Bruce of Reuters confirms that most economists expect a modest increase in UK growth: If they\u2019re right, that will show that Britain has suffered \u201ca clear loss of momentum\u201d this year, say Marc Ostwald of ASM Investor Services. He adds: Overall the UK economy looks it is moving to the bottom of the G7 growth league table, though it should be added that it is currently not headed for recession. If you really want know what\u2019s happening in an economy, GDP is a rather blunt tool. It tries to measure the total value of all of the goods made, and services provided, in an economy, to show whether it grew or shrank. But it doesn\u2019t track unpaid work, show whether growth came at the cost of environmental damage, who benefitted from this economic activity, or whether it made economic inequality better or worse. Nearly fifty years ago, US senator Robert Kennedy eloquently summed up the problems with GDP. In a speech at the University of Kansas, Kennedy explained: \u201cToo much and for too long, we seemed to have surrendered personal excellence and community values in the mere accumulation of material things. Our Gross National Product, now, is over $800 billion dollars a year, but that Gross National Product - if we judge the United States of America by that - that Gross National Product counts air pollution and cigarette advertising, and ambulances to clear our highways of carnage. It counts special locks for our doors and the jails for the people who break them. It counts the destruction of the redwood and the loss of our natural wonder in chaotic sprawl. It counts napalm and its counts nuclear warheads and armored cars for the police to fight the riots in our cities. It counts Whitman\u2019s rifle and Speck\u2019s knife, and the television programs which glorify violence in order to sell toys to our children. Yet the gross national product does not allow for the health of our children, the quality of their education or the joy of their play. It does not include the beauty of our poetry or the strength of our marriages, the intelligence of our public debate or the integrity of our public officials. It measures neither our wit nor our courage, neither our wisdom nor our learning, neither our compassion nor our devotion to our country, it measures everything in short, except that which makes life worthwhile. And it can tell us everything about America except why we are proud that we are Americans.\u201d Many City economist have warned that today\u2019s UK growth figures may show little improvement on the first quarter of this year. Danske Bank\u2019s Kristoffer Kj\u00e6r Lomholt says: We estimate the economy expanded by 0.3% quarter-on-quarter, which is not much stronger than the 0.2% q/q growth rate in Q1 (the weakest among the EU member states). The main reason is that private consumption has slowed, as the weaker pound is eroding consumer purchasing power. Royal Bank of Canada have cut their growth forecast from 0.4% to 0.3%. Here\u2019s why: After considering the pattern of activity in construction and industrial production in April and May, and the headwinds for the consumer that have been constraining elements of service sector growth, we now consider that it would take an unlikely combination of positive news across all sectors in June to get to growth of 0.4% q/q overall. Howard Archer, chief economic adviser to EY Item Club, also expects growth of around 0.3%: \u201cIt looks odds-on that whatever growth the UK managed to eke out in the second quarter will have been solely due to the services sector. \u201cThis does appear to have seen some pick-up in activity after a particularly weak first-quarter performance. \u201cIndustrial production and, especially, construction output both fell month-on-month in April and May, and were clearly on course for contraction over the second quarter. \u201cDespite decent overall manufacturing surveys for June, we suspect industrial production could have contracted by around 0.4% quarter-on-quarter in the second quarter while construction output may have fallen by around 1.7% quarter-on-quarter. Good morning! We\u2019re about to discover how well, or badly, Britain\u2019s economy performed in the last three months. New GDP data, due at 9.30am, will give the first official insight into UK growth in the second quarter of 2017. It will show whether the economy bounced back from its slowdown at the start of the year, or is still stuck in a soft patch. And the figures may reinforce fears that the economy has lost momentum this year. The City\u2019s top number crunchers predict that the economy expanded by between 0.2% and 0.4% in April-to-June, with a consensus of +0.3% growth. Industrial production and construction are expected to have struggled. That would be little better than in Q1, when GDP rose by just 0.2%. That made Britain the slowest-growing G7 economy, as consumer-facing industries shrank and household spending was hit by rising prices. Many economists fear that Britain\u2019s economic fundamentals are deteriorating, as Brexit uncertainty hits business investment and the weak pound pushing up inflation. But more optimistically, Britain\u2019s economy has already racked up 17 quarters of growth in a row. That should become 18 quarters today (unless something very nasty happened....) We\u2019ll bring you the GDP data at 9.30am, followed by instant reaction and analysis through the day, plus any other major economic and financial events.

      "bodyText": "Britain\u2019s car industry has warned that the government\u2019s proposed ban on sales of new petrol and diesel cars by 2040 risks damaging the industry and stalling sales of new cars. Mike Hawes, chief of executive of the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders trade body, said that carmakers were working with ministers on the switch to electric cars but called for the government to use carrots rather than sticks. \u201cOutright bans risk undermining the current market for new cars and our sector, which supports over 800,000 jobs across the UK, so the industry instead wants a positive approach, which gives consumers incentives to purchase these cars. \u201cWe could undermine the UK\u2019s successful automotive sector if we don\u2019t allow enough time for the industry to adjust,\u201d he said. However, experts said two decades was plenty of time for carmakers to evolve away from the internal combustion engine. Prof David Bailey, an automotive industry expert at Aston University, said: \u201cI think that\u2019s more than enough time. It\u2019s sufficiently long to be taken seriously and give the industry time to adjust.\u201d He said that by 2040 carmakers would have switched over to battery-powered vehicles regardless of the government\u2019s announcement. But in the short term, he said ministers needed to do more to ease that switch. \u201cI think where they [carmakers] probably have a point is the government isn\u2019t doing enough to incentivise people to switch over to electric cars and hybrids in the short term,\u201d said Bailey. Motorists are offered a \u00a34,500 government grant off the price of fully electric cars (down from \u00a35,000 when the scheme launched in 2011) and \u00a32,500 for plug-in hybrids, which can run a short distance on a battery before switching to a conventional engine. Bailey said the scheme should stay until the 2020s. Research by Bloomberg New Energy Finance suggests that will be the decade when there is a tipping point as the total cost of owning an electric car \u2013 including refuelling and maintenance, as well as buying the vehicle \u2013 becomes cheaper than combustion engine vehicles without subsidies. BMW, which on Tuesday announced it would make its fully electric mini in Oxford, said it was on track to sell 100,000 fully and partially electric vehicles around the world this year, up from 62,000 in 2016. \u201cWe see electric powertrains as the future for our industry,\u201d a spokesman said. Nissan said it welcomed the move by ministers. However, one luxury carmaker branded the government\u2019s plans \u201cabsurd\u201d because some drivers need to travel long distances. The average range of a new electric car is 100-150 miles, although some of Tesla\u2019s cars can now run for more than 300 miles between charges. Andy Palmer, chief executive of Aston Martin, told the Financial Times: \u201cIf the government is going to legislate then they have to assist as well, otherwise they will destroy part of the industry.\u201d Andy Barratt, managing director of Ford of Britain, told the Guardian: \u201cOur product plans very much support that kind of timeline. A 23-year period is a good notice period.\u201d But he said despite the UK and France announcing a phase-out of new petrol and diesels by 2040, there was \u201cnot a global movement at this point in time\u201d to ban them. The British car industry said it could only hit the 2040 deadline if consumers wanted electric cars. \u201c[Demand is] still at a very low level as consumers have concerns over affordability, range and charging points,\u201d said Hawes. According to a survey of 2,134 drivers, only 2% of people are thinking of buying a pure electric model as their next car. The main reason given for not considering one was cost, followed by concerns over range and the time needed for recharging. The survey, for insurance firm Aviva, also showed that, after VW\u2019s emission scandal and amid concerns over pollution, drivers are turning away from diesel: 68% said their next car would be petrol, with only 21% choosing diesel. New car sales are currently split roughly half and half between petrol and diesel. This year so far, fully electric cars accounted for 0.5% of all new registrations, plug-in hybrids accounted for 1% and hybrids, such as the Toyota Prius, 2.6%. While only 37,000 of the 26m cars on British roads now are pure electric, they are growing at an astonishing rate: SMMT figures for last month show they were up 46% on June 2016. Some carmakers will do better than others out of the transition the government wants. Bailey said that Renault-Nissan, BMW and Volvo, which recently said it would only launch electrified new cars from 2019 onwards, had already gone a \u201clong way\u201d towards a battery-powered future. Ford, by comparison, had been \u201cvery slow\u201d, he said. Ultimately, it was too early to say who would win out, he said. \u201cWho survives and who prospers? We just don\u2019t know at this point.\u201d Ben Lane, director of the site Next Green Car, said VW was also emerging as a leader on electric cars as a result of the emissions scandal over its diesel models. \u201cAt the bottom of the list is Ford. They do have conventional hybrids in US, they do have the Focus electric, but they\u2019ve not pushed it,\u201d he said. Ford was overtaken in terms of stock-market value by Tesla in April this year and the following month parted company with its chief executive, Mark Fields. The head of its driverless car unit, Jim Hackett, was handed the top job. The switch to electric cars will require a significant investment by carmakers, experts said, as the companies re-skill their workforces, invest in research and development and retool their manufacturing facilities. \u201cThe big question: do we see this as a huge opportunity to develop new supply chains, new skills, new technologies? If we don\u2019t develop these, they will happen somewhere else,\u201d said Bailey, who claimed the government was not yet doing enough to support the industry\u2019s transition. Prof Andrew Parkes of Coventry University said the signal the government had sent \u201ccreates a huge opportunity for the UK to lead in the design and development of a new generation of zero-emission and autonomous vehicles\u201d. Chris Gubbey, chief executive of the London Electric Vehicle Company, which is making the new, electrified black cab at a \u00a3325m factory in Coventry, said Britain already had an \u201cexciting, dynamic\u201d electric car sector \u2013 and so would benefit from the switchover.",

However, Capita told the Guardian that, while \u201cthe majority\u201d of those completing the course would be employed either directly by Capita or by one of its clients, applicants were not guaranteed a job. \u201cThe training provided is free of charge with a combination of classroom and distance learning,\u201d the company said. \u201cThe course is designed to allow the participants to continue undertaking work and other activities outside of the free training. The objective is to bridge the gap between graduate-level experience and the requirements of employers, enabling graduates to overcome barriers and enter a sector with high opportunities for career progression.\u201d Capita, which last year announced plans to axe 2,000 jobs and replace some workers with robots to save money, said the Novus programme was separate from the group\u2019s main corporate graduate and apprenticeship schemes. The company employs about 73,000 staff in Britain, Europe and South Africa. Tanya de Grunwald, founder of careers blog Graduate Fog, which first revealed the unpaid traineeships at Capita, said: \u201cHowever, Capita tries to frame it, the structure of their graduate scheme is bizarre \u2013 I\u2019ve never seen anything like it. \u201cRather than recruiting graduates and then training them as salaried employees, they are appear to be training them as non-employees and then choosing whether to recruit them, presumably because it is cheaper. Dressing this up as a \u2018free of charge\u2019 opportunity really takes the biscuit. \u201cA cynical observer might say this is Capita doing what it does best \u2013 ruthlessly minimising its own costs,\u201d he said. She said that graduates were being forced to fund themselves during the training period while gambling on being one of the lucky ones hired by Capita at the end. \u201cIt\u2019s a big gamble: living in London or Manchester for four months is likely to cost them around \u00a34,000,\u201d she said. Michael Newman, an employment law specialist at law firm Leigh Day, said Capita was taking a chance by signing up unpaid trainees. \u201cThere could be an argument that this is training that falls outside national minimum wage legislation but I don\u2019t think that would hold water,\u201d Newman said. \u201cWho is going to bring a national minimum wage claim against an organisation where they want a graduate position? You are not going to do that if you are trying to start your career at Capita,\u201d he said.",

      "bodyText": "Unions have raised concerns about the future of more than 1,000 UK manufacturing jobs after the owner of Boots sold its manufacturing business to France-based specialist Fareva, including the Nottingham factory that it opened in the 1930s. Walgreens Boots Alliance said Fareva had signed a 10-year deal to supply it with products from its own ranges, including No7, Liz Earle and Soltan, after taking over its BCM manufacturing business, which has factories making toiletries and healthcare products in the UK, France and Germany. The deal will mean the transfer of about 1,100 jobs in Beeston, near Nottingham, to the French company. But Boots would not confirm if it had sought any guarantees over the future of manufacturing at D10, the grade I-listed factory that has been operating since 1933. The factory currently makes over-the-counter healthcare products such as painkillers, cold and flu remedies and insect repellents, as well as toiletries including shampoo, face cream and bubble bath. Boots, which was founded by Jesse Boot in 1870, began manufacturing in a terraced house behind its first shop in Nottingham in 1883. Fareva already operates in the UK and the company is expected to present its development plans within six months after the deal is completed. Usdaw, the union that represents workers at the site, said it was seeking an urgent meeting with BCM. Daniel Adams, Usdaw national officer, said he would be \u201clooking for reassurances about jobs, members\u2019 terms and conditions, as well as intended future plans\u201d. \u201cAfter being informed of the company\u2019s intentions to sell its contract manufacturing operation, the hard-working and loyal staff are understandably concerned. This is an unsettling time for members as it is not clear at this point what the impact of the sale will be,\u201d he added. The deal will raise fears of the kind of closures that followed US food group Kraft\u2019s takeover of Cadbury. Nestl\u00e9 also moved production of confectionary products Smarties and Blue Riband abroad after buying Rowntree in 1988. Fareva is the largest contract manufacturer in Europe and one of the largest in the world, employing nearly 10,000 people across 11 countries, including the US, France and Poland. It has one UK factory in Pontyclun, Wales, called Fillcare, which makes toiletries and beauty products. Globally, Fareva produces and packs pharmaceutical, beauty, industrial and household products backed by 12 research and development centres. Walgreens Boots Alliance said: \u201cThe proposed agreement will create a partnership to provide Walgreens Boots Alliance with a core multinational manufacturing and development resource, enabling the company to accelerate its global product strategy.\u201d The group now has a presence in 25 countries after a series of major mergers, operating a number of retail chains as well as the world\u2019s largest global pharmaceutical wholesale and distribution network. This week, Boots was forced to apologise for the way it responded to a campaign calling for it to cut the price of emergency contraception.",

      "bodyText": "Fever-Tree\u2019s chief executive and co-founder, Tim Warrillow, has toasted the drinks company\u2019s shares reaching a record high by cashing in nearly \u00a329m of his stake. Warrillow sold 1.5m shares on Tuesday at \u00a319.25 each, shortly after the upmarket tonic water maker reported a 77% surge in half-year revenues and said full year results would be \u201cmaterially ahead of expectations\u201d. The news resulted in its shares soaring 23% to \u00a321.56 before slipping back to \u00a320.58, its best day since November. They were up 4% at \u00a321.40 in early trading on Wednesday. This latest sale leaves Warrillow with a 5.4% stake, and a spokesman said the move was made to satisfy demand from institutional investors. He said: \u201cThere remains considerable demand from institutions both in UK and US for sizeable blocks of Fever-Tree shares and therefore Tim took the decision to provide some further liquidity in the register in response to this.\u201d The company is benefiting from the continuing popularity of gin and tonic, which helped boost sales in continental Europe by 64%. The UK remains its key market, with revenues up 113%. Warrillow, a former advertising executive, raised \u00a37.6m by selling shares when Fever-Tree floated at 134p a share in November 2014, valuing the company at just \u00a3154m. Less than three years later it is now worth \u00a32.4bn. So far Warrillow has raised around \u00a342m since the flotation, having also sold \u00a35.4m worth of shares in March 2016. Co-founder Charles Rolls sold about a quarter of his shares in May, netting about \u00a373m after selling a 3.9% stake in the company. In all he has cashed in to the tune of around \u00a3100m, since he sold a \u00a312m tranche of shares last year and around \u00a317m in the flotation. Non-executive chairman Bill Ronald also sold shares on Tuesday, raising \u00a31m and leaving him with 0.3%. Neil Wilson, a senior market analyst at ETX Capital, said the shares were not cheap at the current price, and the company could see tougher times ahead in the UK: \u201cFever-Tree will have to continue to grow at this clip to justify the valuations [and] maintaining this level of growth in the UK will be tough as this market could deteriorate over the next couple of years if there is a hit to consumer spending from inflation and any Brexit-related slowdown.\u201d But he added that sales in Europe, the US and the rest of the world continued to improve. Analysts at RBC raised their price target after the results from \u00a319.50 to \u00a324 with an outperform rating. Warrillow and Rolls \u2013 a former management consultant who helped revive the Plymouth Gin brand \u2013 set up the business in 2005 to challenge the dominance of Schweppes. They travelled the world searching for the best ingredients, and named the company after the fever trees in the Congo which produce the quinine used in tonic water.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "ITV is banking on hits including Love Island and returning drama Victoria to attract viewers as it faces the worst year for UK TV advertising in almost a decade. The broadcaster said TV advertising slumped 8% to \u00a3769m in the first half of the year \u2013 the worst fall since the final quarter of 2008 \u2013 and blamed marketers for holding back budgets due to \u201congoing economic and political uncertainty\u201d. ITV\u2019s pre-tax profits slumped 16% to \u00a3259m in the first six months of 2017. June was a particularly difficult month, with advertising revenue plummeting 18% year on year against a tough comparison with the same month in 2016, when ITV had European Championship football coverage. ITV said it expected to perform better in the third quarter, with TV ad revenue improving to a 4% decline. The broadcaster praised the performance of Love Island \u2013 which set viewing records for ITV2 and drove its share of advertising viewed by 16- to 34-year-olds, who are leaving traditional TV in droves, by 15%. ITV\u2019s chairman, Sir Peter Bazalgette, responsible for bringing Big Brother to the UK, said the show had its own identity as escape TV as the public faces increasingly tough economic times. \u201cLove Island is Love Island,\u201d said Bazalgette, who admitted he was one of the 2.6 million viewers of Monday night\u2019s final. \u201cIt is a really delightful show. I think it hits the mood of the times. It is romantic, positive, upbeat. Love Island demonstrates that young viewers engage in great TV content.\u201d The show has spawned catchphrases such as \u201c100% my type on paper\u201d, which Primark has struck a deal to use as a slogan on clothing, and more than 75,000 of the personalisable water bottles given to the contestants have been sold. The show, which ran from early June, will help the broadcaster\u2019s performance in the second half of the year. ITV said the second half of the year would prove to be better with a \u201cbuild-up of programme stock\u201d, including Victoria and Cold Feet, set to bolster its advertising performance. The broadcaster saw a healthy 4% bump in share price in early trading as analysts, who had factored in the poor first half performance, were buoyed by more positive outlook for the second half of the year. Analysts expect ITV\u2019s ad revenue to be down about 6% for the full year, which will be its worst annual performance since a 9.4% fall in 2009. However, the broadcaster said it expected to outperform the wider UK TV ad market. \u201cWe are in a very different environment to then [2009],\u201d said finance chief Ian Griffith, who is running ITV as chief operating officer until the arrival of Carolyn McCall to replace Adam Crozier as chief executive in January. \u201cWe are a much more scaled and resilient business. We are very different compared to the last time the market had to face a downturn in advertising.\u201d Bazalgette said he expects McCall, who joins from easyJet on 8 January, to lead a \u201crefresh\u201d at ITV. However, he added that the broadcaster would stick to its current strategy of diversifying away from a reliance on advertising by expanding its TV production business, ITV Studios, and building online revenues. \u201cEvery strategy of every company benefits from being refreshed and that is the job we will be doing with Carolyn McCall in the new year,\u201d he said. \u201cYes, we do wish to be an integrated producer broadcaster, we do wish to rebalance the company and we do wish to continue to strengthen our studios business.\u201d Griffith said he had not seen a \u201csignificant shift\u201d in ad spend from Google or Facebook into TV following widespread concerns about ads running online next to inappropriate content such as extremist material and fake news. Asked about the threat of Netflix, which last week announced strong growth breaking the 100 million global subscriber mark, Bazalgette classified it as a \u201cfrenemy\u201d. ITV competes with services such as Netflix for viewers but also produces and sells it shows through ITV Studios, maker of shows including The Voice, Come Dine With Me and Coronation Street. \u201cITV family [of channels] has a 21% share of viewing in the UK, Netflix [if it was measured] would have a 4% share,\u201d he said. \u201cThey have the share [size] of one of the healthier digital channels.\u201d ITV also said that it intends to press ahead with trying to force Virgin Media to pay to carry its channels, after an arcane law that protects cable platforms from having to pay copyright or retransmission fees to public service broadcasters is repealed on 31 July. Analysts optimistically hope that ITV can make tens of million of pounds charging retransmission fees not just to Virgin Media, but also other rivals. \u201cFrom [31 July] we look forward to negotiating for proper value on all channels,\u201d said Bazalgette.",

      "bodyText": "The chairman of ITV has weighed in on the gender pay row, saying his company would never reveal details of deals with its stars but expects to show an improvement in the gap between male and female staff when it is forced to report figures next year. Sir Peter Bazalgette, the chairman of the UK\u2019s biggest commercial free-to-air broadcaster, said it took the issue seriously but would not consider following the BBC in publishing details of the pay of its top staff. \u201cWe take gender issues, employment and pay very seriously as a company,\u201d said Bazalgette, the former creative chief and chairman of Big Brother programme-maker Endemol. \u201cBut we are a commercial broadcaster. The BBC is funded with public money. We would never discuss confidential contracts for anyone working at ITV.\u201d He said 52% of ITV\u2019s 6,531 staff were female, and women accounted for 43% of its 146 senior managers. However, the company\u2019s latest annual report also shows that just two of its eight-strong board are female. Following the arrival of the new chief executive, Carolyn McCall, the easyJet chief who joins on 8 January, the ratio will become three to five. From next year, the government is forcing companies with more than 250 employees to disclose how much they are paying in salaries and bonuses to their male and female staff, which will be published in a league table ranking large firms by their gender pay gaps. \u201cNext April as required we will publish gender pay gap numbers,\u201d Bazalgette said. \u201cThat is something we monitor closely and we will be able to show a year-on-year improvement in those numbers. But in terms of specific contracts, confidential contracts, of talent behind and in front of the camera, that is not something we would ever reveal.\u201d Bazalgette said ITV was already striving to increase the diversity of on- and off-air talent in its ranks as a member of an industry initiative called Project Diamond, which measures the ethnic, gender and sexual orientation makeup of the British television industry. The project also counts the BBC, Channel 4 and Sky as participants. \u201cWe are supporters and subscribers to Project Diamond ... to work hard hard to monitor and improve diversity in front of the camera and behind the camera,\u201d he said. Last week, the BBC published a list of stars paid more than \u00a3150,000 a year, which sparked a row over the glaring differences in the pay rates of men and women at the corporation. The BBC\u2019s list revealed that one-third of its top earners were women and the top seven were all men, with male co-presenters frequently earning more than their female colleagues. On Sunday, more than 40 of the BBC\u2019s most high-profile women wrote to Tony Hall, the director general, calling on him to urgently correct the gender pay gap. Earlier this month, Channel 4 said it had no intention of following the BBC in revealing the salaries of its top talent. Channel 4 is state-owned but, unlike the BBC, is independently funded mostly through TV advertising. \u201cThis is a heated issue and a very political one,\u201d said Jay Hunt, Channel 4\u2019s outgoing chief creative officer. \u201cI am very much of the view that it is inflationary and causes competitive situations with other broadcasters and is not an effective way of managing talent.\u201d",
