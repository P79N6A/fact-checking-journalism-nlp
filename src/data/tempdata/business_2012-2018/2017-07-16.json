      "bodyText": "The UK housing market is shrugging off concerns in the wider economy following the Brexit vote, compounding problems for many first-time buyers still wrestling with the strongest year-on-year price rises in the market. There are more buyers and sellers in the wider market compared with the period around the referendum a year ago, with the number of sales agreed up by 4.6% in June 2017 compared with June 2016, the latest survey by property website Rightmove found. The company added that prospective buyers are \u201cseeing a lot of sold boards on properties they would like to buy themselves\u201d \u2013 with over 45% of estate agents\u2019 property stock now being sold subject to contract. Meanwhile, cumulative sales agreed during 2017 are almost on a par with the same period in 2016, down by 0.4%, even though the first six months of last year was boosted by the rush to beat the April 2016 stamp duty deadline, the survey added. Miles Shipside, Rightmove director and housing market analyst, said: \u201cA year on from the shock referendum result and subsequent dent in activity levels, the fundamentals remain strong. \u201cLow unemployment, low interest rates, strong demand and historic undersupply of homes are mitigating any wobbles in confidence and as a result nearly half the properties on the market, over 45%, have sold signs slapped across them.\u201d The monthly survey, which is calculated on asking prices rather than completed transactions, comes at a time of year when the property market is typically quiet, as buyers and sellers take a break from the spring selling season and households concentrate more on holidays than house buying. According to Rightmove, the seasonal slowdown in activity has caused the overall market to rise by just 0.1% last month, but while that includes a drop in prices for first-time buyers outside of London since June, the traditional blip in the market at this time of year has provided little solace for embattled buyers trying to get on the property ladder. The data shows that the national average asking price for people buying their first home has dropped by 1.7% since last month to \u00a3196,450, but that figure is still 3.8% higher than a year ago, while the first-time buyer sector is the highest riser in the market during 2017. Still, Rightmove cautioned that in spite of high demand and lack of suitable supply, stretched buyer affordability continues to act as a price brake. While all regions have seen year-on-year price rises, the national average stands at a \u201crelatively subdued\u201d increase of 2.8% to \u00a3316,421, the company said. The warnings about supply also dovetail with a survey from the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (Rics) published last week, which showed that the average number of properties available per agency branch had fallen to an all-time low in June, at just over 42. Brian Murphy, head of lending for Mortgage Advice Bureau, added: \u201cThe average time to sell, standing at 60 days in this month\u2019s [Rightmove] report, has remained broadly unchanged now for the last quarter, and also points to market consistency in most areas that again flies in the face of some who might suggest that the market is in negative territory. \u201cQuite to the contrary, all of these indicators would point to a calm, steady and functioning UK market, with perhaps those consumers who did decide to \u2018wait and see\u2019 in the lead up the election now deciding to simply get on with their move, adding yet more motivated movers into the mix in most parts of the UK.\u201d Overall, the West Midlands has experienced the greatest price rises in England and Wales during 2017, according to the Rightmove survey, with prices 6.1% higher than last year. The East Midlands has been the next best performer with price growth of 4.9% followed by Yorkshire and Humber at 4.1%. Greater London has had the weakest growth of the regions outside central London over the past 12 months with 0.9%, followed by the north-east with 1.6%.",

      "bodyText": "Rafael Behr\u2019s commentary on Matthew Taylor\u2019s \u201cgig economy\u201d report is too kind by half (The gig economy can be exploitative \u2013 but there is no easy path to Good Work, 12 July). Both in the report and in interviews, Taylor seems more concerned to preserve the gig economy business model than worried about the resultant exploitation. The business owners\u2019 excuse, that they couldn\u2019t run their business otherwise, is exactly the same old excuse used right back to the slave owners. If the only way the business model can work is by denying workers\u2019 rights, rights hard-won by generations of struggle, then that flawed model has no place in any kind of decent, fair society. The Orwellian rebranding of the workers\u2019 title \u201cdependent contractors\u201d, or some such nonsense, should tell you all you need to know about how flawed Taylor\u2019s proposals are. It really is that simple. Simon Diggins Rickmansworth, Hertfordshire \u2022 Rafael Behr agonises over the trade-off facing the gig economy, between having a flexible labour market and guaranteeing a minimum hourly income for people who work flexibly. The Taylor review posits that people in the gig economy who choose to work at off-peak times should not necessarily be entitled to the minimum wage. But when I raised this in the House of Commons, the minister could not have been clearer in her assurance: \u201cMinimum wages rates are sacrosanct. There will be no trade-off when it comes to ensuring that everybody is paid at least the minimum wage.\u201d This is a clear undertaking from the government. The House\u2019s job now is to ensure that undertaking is honoured in any subsequent legislation. If gig companies are required by law always to abide by the minimum wage, even if that means a loss in flexibility, they will need to regulate the supply of labour or pay from their profits the minimum wage when there is not the level of demand to pay all workers at that rate. Frank Field MP Labour, Birkenhead \u2022 Theresa May doesn\u2019t need to introduce new laws to protect workers in the gig economy: British employment law is fair and robust already. But what she could do is ensure that the basics of the law and economics are explained to everyone before they start working, preferably at school, so they can assess the viability of an \u201coffer\u201d themselves. Most of these workers are actually not self-employed, so are entitled to holiday pay, statutory sick pay and the other benefits of payrolled employment, while the rates their employers offer are not economically viable as a sole income. A properly self-employed worker has to charge many times more per hour than their waged colleagues in order to achieve parity of income. Until this is explained to school leavers, this type of exploitation will continue. Michael Heaton Warminster, Wiltshire \u2022 Can you be self-employed if you only have one employer? The taxman once had a rule that you couldn\u2019t. Who changed that? Ian Davidson London \u2022 The Guardian has been conducting investigations into the gig economy over the past few months. The publication last Tuesday of the Taylor report into the same topic therefore ought to have justified more than the usual level of coverage. Instead, what did we get? Theresa May, Rebecca Long-Bailey and the GMB offer their reactions to the report, Robert Booth gives us a critical summary of the report, we get another two tales from the gig economy, and there is an editorial along with a comment piece by Rafael Behr. What we do not get is a proper report of the report itself, its main recommendations, its findings and some key excerpts from it. When the facts of the matter are supplanted by a flurry of opinions from all and sundry, you do your readers a disservice. I\u2019d like to know what Taylor says, after which opinions can be aired. Roderick MacFarquhar Edinburgh \u2022 Wortley Hall, the self-styled \u201cworkers\u2019 stately home\u201d on the outskirts of Sheffield, is a wonderful monument to the co-operative movement and the trade unions and has been lovingly restored to its former glory. Is there any need for it to hire staff on zero-hours contracts? Malcolm Smith Pwllheli, Gwynedd \u2022 In defence of freelancing stewards at Lord\u2019s (Letters, 12 July), while I appreciate the reasons that led Rick Hall to resign his Tate membership in sympathy with the staff on zero-hours contracts, the case at Lords is rather different. The Tate has a permanent exhibition and therefore a relatively constant need for a certain number of staff, but the number of stewards required at a Test cricket ground varies vastly. While crowds of over 20,000 can be expected to enter Lord\u2019s on up to 15 days of the year, there will seldom be a 20th of that number for the other 350 days. For at least five months of the year there will be no spectators at all. To expect the MCC to employ full-time staff on that basis is maybe a little exaggerated. Juan Carlos Escandell Bonn, Germany \u2022 I am a chef and a father of four children. Today in the world of UK hospitality, working hours laid down in our contracts are 48 per week, but we are bound by signing an extra clause to our contract that commits us to work more as required by the establishment \u2013 which usually means a working week of between 55 and 60 hours. This evidently leaves little or no room for any quality life. Of course, you feel obliged to sign this clause as this is part and parcel of the job offer but you soon realise that it is a trap. You live a life of modern-day slavery in which you don\u2019t see your family, you have poor quality sleep and you never get enough rest. In short, you are exploited to the maximum. Needless to say, turnover is extremely high in the hospitality business among chefs. In our job we know when we start our shift, but not when it ends. Why do we have to be different from any other profession that has reasonable eight-hour shifts? The hospitality industry currently receives recognition in the form of star rankings from various reviewing bodies \u2013 depending on the quality of menus, their creativity and presentation, prices, the excellence of service and so on. But who is taking responsibility to ensure that cooks and chefs have a balance between work and family and living any sort of quality life? Surely, we are more important than the star rankings? Many people in this industry are suffering and they have no other choice as no law is protecting them.

      "bodyText": "Poundland has been forced to delay the launch of a Toblerone copycat after getting stuck in a legal wrangle with the triangular chocolate bar\u2019s owners. Last month, the budget chain announced plans to begin selling Twin Peaks, a bar with two humps rather than the distinctive single peak chunks of the Toblerone bar, which is one of the discounter\u2019s biggest sellers. Instead of featuring the iconic Matterhorn on its red and gold packaging, the Poundland version featured the Wrekin, a hill in Shropshire near the company\u2019s head office, and was made in Birmingham rather than Switzerland. At 180g, it was also 30g heavier than the \u00a31 Toblerone currently available. The Twin Peaks bar was initially planned to launch at the beginning of this month, and then delayed until the middle of July. But fans asking this week where they could find the bar were told by Poundland customer services there was currently no launch date. It is understood that Poundland still plans to go ahead with selling Twin Peaks, but the launch has been delayed after the company received a legal letter from Toblerone. The companies held talks last week but neither side would comment on any dispute. A spokesman for Poundland said: \u201cTwin Peaks is still in development.\u201d The launch of Poundland\u2019s copycat bar was an attempt to fill a gap in the market, after Toblerone resorted to shrinkflation ahead of Christmas last year, widening the spaces between chunks, as it tried to maintain the price of the bar amid rising ingredient costs. It cut the weight of two bars from Toblerone\u2019s UK range with 400g bars falling to 360g while the 170g bars, which are one of Poundland\u2019s best sellers, slimmed to 150g. Mondelez, the owner of Toblerone, said the change was not Brexit related, but the fall in the value of the pound after last summer\u2019s EU referendum was seen by many as a likely contributing factor to the firm\u2019s rising costs. The shift to the altered bar was criticised by fans as \u201cstupid\u201d, \u201cridiculous\u201d and \u201cjust plain dumb\u201d. At the time of the launch of Twin Peaks, Poundland trading director Barry Williams told the Telegraph: \u201cPoundland shoppers are savvy and the change in their favourite chocolate bar last Christmas didn\u2019t go unnoticed. That\u2019s why we\u2019ve created a new \u00a31 alternative for them \u2013 the size they wanted, with a British taste, and with all the spaces in the right places.\u201d Poundland has launched copycat versions of several confectionery favourites as part of its strategy to keep a lid on inflation. Currently on sale are Miracles, which bear a resemblance to Galaxy Minstrels \u2013 made by Mars \u2013 and Nutters, which appear similar to the Mars-manufactured M&amp;M\u2019s.",

      "bodyText": "Prepare for the age of the driverless car and the robot that does the housework. That was the message from the World Economic Forum earlier this year as it hailed the start of a new industrial revolution. According to the WEF, the fourth big structural change in the past 250 years is upon us. The first industrial revolution was about water and steam. The second was about electricity and mass production. The third harnessed electronics and information technology to automate production. Now it is the turn of artificial intelligence, nanotechnology, biotechnology, materials science, 3D printing and quantum computing to transform the global economy. \u201cThe speed of current breakthroughs has no historical precedent\u201d, the WEF said. \u201cWhen compared with previous industrial revolutions, the fourth is evolving at an exponential rather than a linear pace.\u201d But if this really is the dawning of a new age, it seems somebody forgot to tell the people with the power to turn ideas into products. The multinational companies that bankroll the WEF\u2019s annual meeting in Davos are awash with cash. Profits are strong. The return on capital is the best it has been for the best part of two decades. Yet investment is weak. Companies would rather save their cash or hand it back to shareholders than put it to work. One possible explanation for this corporate caution is that businesses think bad times are just around the corner. If, for example, companies thought the tepid recovery from the financial crisis was a brief respite before another downturn, it would make sense to stash some money away now. Any UK company that fancies a risk-averse approach has the perfect excuse for sitting pat: the uncertainty caused by Brexit. But this is not an entirely convincing explanation. As the economist Paul Ormerod noted in a recent article for City AM, corporate hoarding was going on well before Brexit became an issue and it affects all western capitalist countries, not just Britain. Ormerod illustrates the point by contrasting the behaviour of the US corporate sector over the past decade with that during the Great Depression. If ever there was a time when companies might have been excused for salting their cash away it was the 1930s, when the US economy contracted by a quarter. Yet in the dark years after the Wall Street Crash, the US corporate sector ran down its cash pile, so much so that it had negative savings in the years from 1930 to 1934. The new breed of US executives have done things differently. US corporate saving has been higher since the crash than it was in the decade before it. Another explanation is that the smart people running companies know what they are doing, and are simply waiting for the right moment to invest in the fourth industrial revolution. This is not entirely convincing either, since one of the core principles of investing is that the biggest profits are reserved for those who seize the opportunities first. Other reasons canvassed for the lack of investment are that cutting-edge companies need less physical capital than they did in the past, and more money in the bank unless somebody comes along with a takeover bid. But the most obvious explanation of all is that the people running companies are dominated by short-term performance targets and the need to keep shareholders sweet. Up until the 1980s, investment by the US corporate sector averaged 4% of GDP while dividends averaged 2% of GDP. Today, it is the other way around. Distributed profits used to average 35-45% of total US corporate profits in the 1950s, which is why there was plenty left over to invest in growing the business. Yet for the past few decades, the trend has been unmistakable: less money for investment, more set aside for dividends. In the UK, 2017 is expected to be a record year after analysis by Capita showed that shareholders grabbed north of \u00a333bn in the second quarter. Were he still alive, Milton Friedman would have said company bosses were doing exactly the right thing. Friedman believed strongly in shareholder value maximisation. Shareholder value maximisation has certainly delivered for the top 1%. They own 40% of the US stock market and benefit from the dividend payouts, and the share buybacks that drive prices higher on Wall Street. Those running companies, also members of the 1%, have remuneration packages loaded up with stock options, so they too get richer as the company share price goes up. But what of the other 99%? Where do they fit into this cosy little world? Well, the short answer is that what gains they get to the value of their pensions from rising share prices are dwarfed by the impact of weaker investment. And it is the lack of investment that explains why the recovery from the recession has been so feeble, why productivity has been so poor, why average incomes have flatlined and why growth has been accompanied by a buildup in consumer debt. It hardly needs saying that this was not quite what was promised when the Thatcherites and the Reaganites took control 40 years ago. Then, weak growth was blamed on over-mighty trade unions and a state that spent and borrowed too much. Private investment, it was said, was being crowded out by wasteful public investment. Governments that borrowed for their pet projects drove up market interest rates, making investment less attractive for an army of frustrated entrepreneurs. This explanation no longer holds. Both official and market interest rates have been ultra-low for a decade. Trade unions have been smashed. Nationalised industries have been privatised. So where\u2019s the investment? Back in the \u201cbad old days\u201d, a loose social contract applied. Companies gave a slice of their profits to shareholders but invested the bigger portion of them. Higher investment led to higher productivity which in turn financed higher wages, higher demand and higher profits. Both capital and labour benefited from this arrangement. The new model \u2013 that saw the fruits of weaker growth go disproportionately to the 1% \u2013 was never likely to work as well and, sure enough, by all the key metrics \u2013 investment, living standards, productivity \u2013 growth rates are lower now than they were when Friedman and his disciples took control. What was promised was a new golden age of capitalism. What they have delivered is a world on the brink of secular stagnation. If innovation is going on apace (which it is) and companies have cash in the bank (which they do), one solution is simply to wait for the moment when entrepreneurs rediscover what Keynes called their animal spirits. Another would be for governments to say enough is enough. If, despite the lowest ever borrowing costs and repeated cuts in corporate taxation, the private sector won\u2019t invest in the fourth industrial revolution, the public sector will. The argument for a national investment bank in the UK is that entrepreneurs are not actually very entrepreneurial and that opportunities are being squandered as a result.",

      "bodyText": "There are two ways to run a stock market. The first is to do little more than provide a platform for buyers and sellers to meet. In this lightly policed model, anyone can play. Buyers must look after their own interests and no one can complain too much if the stocks turn out to be duds. The second approach is more demanding. Companies wishing to join such a market must commit to high standards of governance and grant their shareholders strong ownership rights that are enforceable. Investment accidents can still happen, but outright abuses should be rarer. The London stock market was, we assumed, firmly in the second camp. In days of old, the City may not have been overly fussy about shareholder rights. But in the second decade of the 21st century \u2013 and especially after a dangerous experiment from 2010 in attracting Russian companies \u2013 the debate had surely been settled in favour of high standards. After all, a reputation for trust benefits everyone. It attracts long-term investors with big pools of permanent capital and allows companies to enjoy lower funding costs. Now, for the first time in years, it is fair to ask: which side is London really on? And there is an uglier secondary question: are our politicians leaning on the regulators? By proposing bending the London listing rules to attract Aramco, Saudi Arabia\u2019s state-owned oil company, the Financial Conduct Authority has sown the seed of distrust and provoked fury among fund managers. The rule change can be dressed up as minor. The FCA is merely proposing to create a special listing category for companies controlled by sovereign states. That, in itself, is not controversial: companies in the process of privatisation can indeed be viewed as of a special type. The problem is that the FCA wants to allow such companies into its \u201cpremium\u201d listing category while waiving two essential requirements of that description. The state-controlled companies won\u2019t have to give outside shareholders a vote on the appointment of directors who will represent their interests on the board. And worse, the likes of Aramco will be able to ignore rules on related-party transactions that other \u201cpremium\u201d companies must obey. In theory, Aramco, which is looking to list only 5% of its shares, could sell 20% of its assets to the Saudi state and inform outside investors only at a later date. Whatever gloss one applies, calling such companies \u201cpremium\u201d is absurd. The label is meant to denote the highest standards of investor protection. The Investment Association, which represents most of the big fund management houses, hit the nail on the head: \u201cInvestors believe a premium-listed segment without these protections is not a premium segment.\u201d The FCA argues that \u201cinvestors and the market are sufficiently able to assess the additional risks arising from sovereign ownership\u201d. That may be true, but, for heaven\u2019s sake, don\u2019t gloss over those risks by awarding top marks to companies that don\u2019t deserve them. The Saudi royal family may want their $2 trillion oil company to have \u201cpremium\u201d status, but, if the facts don\u2019t fit, that should be the end of the matter. Andrew Bailey, chief executive of the FCA, had been considered the smart-money bet for next governor of the Bank of England. In only a year, he has given the organisation a much-needed air of competence. This Aramco decision, however, looks like a desperate attempt to please political masters who crave a post-Brexit endorsement of the City\u2019s pulling power. Bailey and the FCA should have displayed their independence and declared that the likes of Aramco should make do with a \u201cstandard\u201d listing. It would also have been acceptable to create a purely \u201csovereign\u201d label and keep Aramco well away from the \u201cpremium\u201d club. Instead, the FCA has exposed the London market to the allegation that a whiff of foreign money can produce favourable rulings. The City will pay a price in the end, and Bailey already looks a smaller figure. Has anyone mentioned the S-word? The dreaded word stagflation cannot be yet be applied to the British economy, but it may not be long before it is. Inflation remains persistently high while GDP growth is slowing to a point well below the long-run trend. Wages are growing at a sluggish pace and business investment has almost evaporated. To make matters worse, the fall in the pound that has generated much of the increase in prices, particularly for food and clothes, has done little to improve the trade deficit. It all adds up to the average British worker putting in a 40-hour week for a salary that will be worth \u2013 once prices are taken into account \u2013 less than it was the month before. No wonder discount supermarkets Aldi and Lidl are cleaning up. Shoppers are sure to seek a cheaper alternative when the pressure is on. Inflation figures due on Tuesday are not expected to alter this dire situation. In May the consumer prices index stood at 2.9% and the Reuters poll of City economists resulted in a forecast for June of 2.9%. Plenty of predictions indicate that inflation is only going to get higher as the year wears on. With wage rises averaging 2% in May and likely to stick at this rate throughout 2017, the hit to household disposable incomes is significant. Even more so for those in the public sector, where a 1% pay freeze is in operation. The first thing economists are going to ask is whether the figures will shift opinion on the Bank of England\u2019s monetary policy committee towards an interest rate rise. Three committee members voted last month for an increase, but one of those has since left and new joiners are not known for voting against the consensus in their first few meetings. That means governor Mark Carney will say the inflation numbers are not bad enough to spur him and the rest of the committee into action, and most of his colleagues will nod in agreement. Their fear must be that stagflation is around the corner, and with Brexit looming, it is only getting nearer. Revenue chase puts Carillion up against the wall How can Carillion, a company with 48,000 employees and a \u00a35bn turnover, be exposed as a financial mess in one stock exchange statement \u2013 such as the one that sent its shares crashing 70% last week? A clue can be found in March\u2019s annual report, where chairman Philip Green wrote: \u201cThe group has once again delivered strong revenue growth.\u201d If that sounds benign, it shouldn\u2019t. A construction company that prides itself on growing revenues is dangerous. If it wins contracts by accepting too many risks, disaster often follows. Carillion was floored by just four contracts that went awry. The provision for write-downs is a colossal \u00a3845m. The other part of the story is Carillion\u2019s heavy borrowings. It is towing \u00a3695m plus a big deficit in its pension fund. But the point remains: in the construction business, risk-controls \u2013 not revenues \u2013 are everything. A chairman who told investors about contracts that were refused would be worth listening to.",

Plenty of predictions indicate that inflation is only going to get higher as the year wears on.</p> <p>With wage rises averaging 2% in May and likely to stick at this rate throughout 2017, the hit to household disposable incomes is significant. Even more so for those in the public sector, where a 1% pay freeze is in operation.</p> <p>The first thing economists are going to ask is whether the figures will shift opinion on the Bank of England\u2019s monetary policy committee towards an interest rate rise.</p> <p>Three committee members voted last month for an increase, but <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/jun/22/inflation-rate-increase-economy-bank-mpc-member\" title=\"\">one of those has since left</a> and new joiners are not known for voting against the consensus in their first few meetings. That means governor Mark Carney will say the inflation numbers are not bad enough to spur him and the rest of the committee into action, and most of his colleagues will nod in agreement.</p> <p>Their fear must be that stagflation is around the corner, and with Brexit looming, it is only getting nearer.</p> <h2>Revenue chase puts Carillion up against the wall</h2> <p>How can Carillion, a company with 48,000 employees and a \u00a35bn turnover, be exposed as a financial mess <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/jul/13/carillion-has-no-future-without-rights-issue-of-at-least-500m\" title=\"\">in one stock exchange statement \u2013 such as the one that sent its shares crashing 70% last week</a>?</p> <p>A clue can be found in March\u2019s annual report, where chairman Philip Green wrote: \u201cThe group has once again delivered strong revenue growth.\u201d</p> <p>If that sounds benign, it shouldn\u2019t. A construction company that prides itself on growing revenues is dangerous. If it wins contracts by accepting too many risks, disaster often follows. Carillion was floored by just four contracts that went awry. The provision for write-downs is a colossal \u00a3845m.</p> <p>The other part of the story is Carillion\u2019s heavy borrowings. It is towing \u00a3695m plus a big deficit in its pension fund. But the point remains: in the construction business, risk-controls \u2013 not revenues \u2013 are everything. A chairman who told investors about contracts that were refused would be worth listening to.</p>",
