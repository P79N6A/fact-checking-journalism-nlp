      "bodyText": "It was the largest capital raising in London by a telecoms company since 2001 and the first big Russian arrival since 2007. But MegaFon hardly sprinted over the line. The shares, which the company hoped might fetch $25 each, were priced at a bottom-of-the-range $20 and slipped below even that level when trading started. That's the difference between a valuation of $14bn and one of $11.1bn \u2013 a lot, even when only 15% of the company was actually being sold. What was the problem? Simple: the company and its banking advisers were too greedy on price. MegaFon is not alone in the world of quoted Russian telecoms stocks \u2013 MTS and VimpelCom already have listings in New York. There are decent arguments that MegaFon's medium-term commercial prospects are the brightest of the lot since it is a pure-play Russian operator and appears well-invested for the 4G era. On the other hand, MTS is the market leader. MegaFon, the number two, was pushing its luck in thinking it should be valued at only a slight discount to MTS on an enterprise value-to-cash earnings basis. That is doubly so when you remember that the controlling shareholder is controversial Uzbek oligarch Alisher Usmanov. The complicated structure through which Usmanov's company owns 55.8% of MegaFon was tidied up ahead of flotation and the various shareholder and voting agreements were reasonably well explained. Lord Myners, corporate governance stalwart, was hauled on board, albeit late in the day, as a second independent non-executive director. But London investors still have good reasons to be nervous about being minority shareholders in an oligarch-dominated venture out of eastern Europe. There have been too many disasters in the past. Let Usmanov and MegaFon prove they are different, seems to have been the general mood. Quite right too: if the shares aren't offered at an obviously bargain price, there are plenty of other emerging market stocks to buy.",

      "bodyText": "Four failed Spanish banks including the nationalised giant Bankia have been rescued by the eurozone's bailout fund in exchange for brutal cuts to their workforces, branch networks and balance sheets as tens of thousands of small retail bondholders were also hammered. Bankia, Catalunya Banc, Novagalicia and Banco de Valencia were set to shed more than 10,000 jobs in return for receiving \u20ac37bn (\u00a329.9bn) to clean out toxic real estate assets that will be transferred to a Spanish \"bad\" bank. The news came on the heels of OECD forecasts that see unemployment rising above 6 million people next year as the recession-hit country continues to slash government spending, with a jobless rate set to reach 27%. The harsh conditions imposed by Brussels will force the former savings banks to return to their origins and concentrate on looking after the money of small businesses and families after a decade in which they grew fat on the back of a residential housing boom that left them badly exposed when the bubble burst. The banks must shrink their balance sheets by 60% over five years and immediately sell off \u20ac45bn of real estate assets to the Sareb bad bank at average discounts above 50%. Bondholders will shoulder a hefty \u20ac10bn of losses. They include many small savers lured into buying complex hybrid preference shares during aggressive sales campaigns as Bankia and others struggled to raise money and stay afloat. Bankia announced that its preference shareholders would be forced to take a 39% \"haircut\" on the value of their investments, which they must exchange for ordinary shares. Bankia's chairman, Jos\u00e9 Ignacio Goirigolzarri, said the bank, which claims to hold accounts for one-in-seven Spaniards, would shed 6,000 workers and close 1,100 branches \u2013 or 3% of Spain's high street banking network. It will also sell all holdings in other companies, including a 12% stake in British Airways owner IAG and 15% of the Mapfre insurance company. Banco de Valencia will receive \u20ac4.5bn and has been sold to the healthy CaixaBank for just \u20ac1 \u2013 with European Union competition commissioner Joaqu\u00edn Almunia insisting this was cheaper than winding it up. \"Our objective is to restore the viability of banks receiving aid so that they are able to function without public support in the future,\" Almunia said. Another round of refinancing, involving a group of mid-sized Spanish banks that are trying to avoid similar conditions by raising money themselves, will be decided on 20 December. The bailout money is being loaned at a rate below 1%, finance minister Luis de Guindos said. \"Now that our institution is financially sound, we shall focus on making it profitable because that is the best way to reward our shareholders and also, of course, Spanish taxpayers, so they can recover their investment,\" Goirigolzarri said. Bankia was created by the merger of seven savings banks which have since been hit by allegations of corruption, cronyism and political interference. Goirigolzarri admitted Bankia had been run as if the Spanish economy would grow eternally.",

However, the Financial Times is now challenging this, saying it has seen document that show euro governments could be forced to accept losses on their rescue loans.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/e5be9df4-38b1-11e2-bd13-00144feabdc0.html#axzz2DV8fhsy4\">The FT explains</a>:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The series of measures agreed, which could relieve Greece of billions of euros in debt by the end of the decade, do not go far enough....</p> </blockquote> <p>The agreed measures will only lower Greece\u2019s debt levels to 126.6% per cent of economic output by 2020, not the 124% announced by eurozone leaders. This shortfall will be addressed once Greece has a primary surplus:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Because the deal already cuts interest on loans to just 50 basis points above interbank lending rates, any further cuts would almost certainly force losses on to eurozone creditors.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>And that also probably won't happen before 2014 \u2013 after the German elections.</strong></p> <p>Bloomberg is also unimpressed, <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-11-27/europe-s-plan-c-for-greece-is-no-better-than-plans-a-or-b.html\">arguing that this new scheme - Plan C - is really no better than what's gone before</a>. Only full debt relief can help Greece, it argues:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>When the time comes to craft Plan D, Europe\u2019s leaders would do well to move ahead with the Greek debt writedown they have tried so hard to avoid.</p> <p>If, for example, they cut the government\u2019s debt in half, and if its market borrowing cost could be brought down to about 5 percent, Greece could hold its debt burden steady by running a primary budget surplus (excluding interest payments) of roughly 1.5 percent of GDP - well within the range of what it has been able to achieve in the past. The upfront costs would be greater, but so would the chances of success.</p> </blockquote> <p>The rest of the eurozone probably understands this all too well. As Sky News's Ed Conway puts it:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>On the basis that if Jean-Claude Juncker denies something, it's probably true, it's worth examining the deal cranked through in Brussels last night to \"save\" Greece....</p> <p>Were this a private sector loan agreement, the probability is it would be regarded as a technical default.</p> </blockquote> <p>So, the deal's honeymoon is over.</p> <p>As usual, I'll be tracking developments across the eurozone throughout that day.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2012-11-28T09:13:05.768Z\">at 9.13am GMT</time></p>  </div>",

      "bodyText": "Looks like we're done for the day. Here's a brisk closing summary: \u2022 Thousands of jobs will be cut across Spain's banking sector after the EC approved a \u20ac37bn restructuring. Four nationalised banks will shrink by 60%, and investors will also share the cost of the rescue, contributing \u20ac10bn. Analysis at 12.54pm, with details of Bankia's plans to close over a third of branches at 11.32am. (and a full story online here) \u2022 Concern is growing over Greece's debt deal. Analysts are warning that eurozone governments will need to take further losses, shifting the cost onto the taxpayers. We have a round-up of views at 8.43am, a leaked chart showing further measures are needed at 11.52am, and a graph showing who owns Greek debt at 12.52pm. \u2022 The Athens government got down to work. Finance minister Yannis Stournaras said the upcoming debt buyback would be voluntary, and had to succeed (see 2.27pm) while Antonis Samaras, Greece's prime minister, told his cabinet to push on with implementing its commitments (see 1.41pm) \u2022 The European Commission released plans for the future of monetary union. The Blueprint for a Deep and Genuine Economic and Monetary Union included banking union, closer fiscal integration, eurobonds, and a single seat at the IMF and the G8 (which may all sound familiar). Details from 3.23pm. We'll be back tomorrow. Thanks as ever. Goodnight. From Madrid, Giles Tremlett has filed a full story on the Spanish bank rescue. Eurozone rescues failed Spanish banks in exchange for brutal cuts Here's a flavour: The harsh conditions imposed by Brussels will force the former savings banks to return to their origins and concentrate on looking after the money of small businesses and families after a decade in which they grew fat on the back of a residential housing boom that left them badly exposed when the bubble burst. The banks must shrink their balance sheets by 60% over five years and immediately sell off \u20ac45bn of real estate assets to the Sareb bad bank at average discounts above 50%. Bondholders will shoulder a hefty \u20ac10bn of losses. Here's confirmation that the public anger in Greece has not faded: Spanish government debt has rallied strongly today, pushing down the yield on its 10-year bonds by 20 basis points (a decent move) to 5.34% (from 5.54%). Looks like relief that the bank recapitalisation is agreed, and the fact the Greek deal is holding together.... Click here if you bunked off Greek.... Sony Kapoor of the Re-Define thinktank isn't blown away by the EC's proposals for a better monetary union, and warns that the most valuable parts of the plan might face political opposition: At the Brussels press conference (see 3.23pm) Peter Spiegel of the Financial Times asks the European commission president, Jos\u00e9 Manuel Barroso, whether he can push his proposals through in the current political climate. Barroso replies that recent progress in fixing the euro crisis means some leaders are losing their focus, saying: Not all countries have the same sense of urgency as some months ago. Barroso cites the creation of the European stability mechanism, the ECB's OMT programme (the bazooka in search of a target) and this week's Greek deal, adding that Europe must maintain its focus on creating permanent solutions to the crisis. Explaining the EU's new blueprint, Olli Rehn argues that the eurozone should have a single seat at international groups such as the International Monetary Fund and the G8. Rehn said: In our view the euro area must be able to speak with a single voice on issues such as euro area economic policy matters... and exchange rate policies, whether in the G20, the IMF or the G8. At the moment Europe take up half of the table at the G8 (with Germany, France, Italy and the UK facing the US, Japan, Canada and Russia), although officials such as Jos\u00e9 Manuel Barroso and Herman Van Rompuy do also attend.... Here's a taster of the EU's vision of a \"deep and genuine EMU\" All major economic and fiscal policy choices by Member States would be subject to deeper coordination, endorsement and surveillance at the European level. The Blueprint sets out the path to a deep and genuine EMU, which involves incremental measures taken over the short, medium and longer term. Part of the agenda can be delivered on the basis of the current Treaties, though part of it requires Treaty change. The blueprint includes three sections \u2022 The short term (six to 18 months ahead): finalising the details of a single European banking union, and agreeing new budget controls \u2022 The medium term (18 months to five years): further strengthening of the collective conduct of budgetary and economic policy - perhaps through collective short-term borrowing. * The long term (five years onwards): a deeply integrated economic and fiscal governance framework - including a single eurozone budget and full-blown eurobonds (subject to the 'adequate pooling' of sovereignty). The EU has released details of its vision for the future, in a document called a Blueprint for a Deep and Genuine Economic and Monetary Union. UPDATE: The executive summary is online here. And the full report is online here (pdf) Over in Brussels, the EC president, Jos\u00e9 Manuel Barroso, commissioner Olli Rehn and Michel Barnier, responsible for the internal market, are holding a press conference now to explain the EU's vision for monetary union. You can watch it here: The International Monetary Fund has warned that Spain's banking sector faces many difficult challenges, despite the \u20ac37bn recapitalisation agreed today. In a new report, the IMF warns: However, the most challenging steps lie ahead, especially those related to implementing bank restructuring plans and making the asset management company [Spain's new bad bank] effective. The IMF is concerned that the European Central Bank is having to offer significant support to Spain's banks to prevent a liquidity crisis. It also cited a string of problems facing Spain, including tight credit conditions, falling house prices, and the government's fiscal consolidation plan. Latest word from Berlin is that the Bundestag will vote on the Greek bailout agreement on Friday. It appears that the SDP wanted to delay it until next week, when the situation should be clearer. Greece's finance minister has been explaining the details of the country's debt agreement at an Athens press conference. Yannis Stournaras said that Greece's debt buyback \u2013 the most confusing and controversial part of the deal - will be voluntary and must succeed, calling it a test of the country's \"trustworthiness\". He also denied that Greece is heading for another haircut, saying the idea of writing down the value of Greek loans was not on the table, and had been rejected. Kathimerini has more: Greece's prime minister has urged his government to redouble its efforts to create new jobs and to pay the state's debts to the private sector. Antonis Samaras made the call at a cabinet meeting in Athens this afternoon. He also reminded ministers that they need to implement the decisions in the \u20ac13.5bn austerity plan that Greece agreed this month (and which will see thousands more public workers lose their jobs) That's via Kathimerini, which adds: At the meeting the Greek premier asked the coalition's ministers to refrain from making 'triumphant' statements in the aftermath of the deal brokered by eurozone finance ministers and the International Monetary Fund in Brussels on Tuesday and labeled recent developments as \"good management of the situation\" by the current administration. Our Madrid correspondent, Giles Tremlett, has analysed Europe's bailout of the Spanish banking sector - and reports that the four nationalised Spanish banks, led by Bankia, will shrink by a massive 60%. That means huge job cuts in a country with 25% unemployment and helps show why the OECD was probably right yesterday when it predicted a rise to 27% next year. Brussels has been ruthless with Spain's failed former cajas, or savings banks, which had become bloated with toxic real estate. They must sell their shares in other companies, stop lending to real estate developers and concentrate on retail clients. Clients of Bankia and fellow bailout case Novagalicia who bought hybrid preference shares (often believing they were stable investments) will take a hammering. They, and other holders of subordinated debt, must take a \u20ac10bn hit. Bankia holds 10% of Spanish retail deposits, with 7.5 million clients. The other banks are Catalunya Banc, Novagalicia and Banco de Valencia (which is being sold to Caixabank for one euro, after taking \u20ac4.5bn in European bailout cash). As reported at 11.19am, the four banks will jointly receive \u20ac37bn from the European bailout fund. They will also sell their real estate assets to a \u201cbad bank\u201d at discounts of up to 63%. And as flagged up at 11.32am, Bankia is to cut 28% of its workforce. That means around 6,000 job cuts there alone. Via the indispensable Open Europe, here's a graphic of Greek debt ownership - showing that 70.5% is held by \"official\" (rather than private) creditors. A quarter is held by the European Financial Stability Facility (the bailout fund), and another third is also used as security for loans from the eurozone or held by the ECB. National central banks also have a substantial slice. Not easy to see how eurozone taxpayers can avoid paying for any further Greek debt restructuring... That comes from this Open Europe analysis, which cautions against believing that eurozone governments have agreed to take future losses in order to keep Greece in the eurozone: This deal does everything to avoid taking such a decision, and continues to sidestep the issue even if that means prolonging the pain and putting more taxpayer cash on the line. The hope is that such a deal will be politically more palatable after the German elections next autumn. This may well be true but given that many of the constraints on solving this crisis are legal as well as political, such a decision may not be much easier even after the elections. The euro has been falling today, and just dropped below $1.29 (having risen above $1.30 when the eurogroup agreement was announced). Another sign that relief over the Greek deal is abating. Tony Blair has attacked the idea that Britain should leave the European Union. In a major speech, the former PM (and current JP Morgan adviser) argued that Britain would suffer a damaging loss of influence if it were abandon the EU. Britain being part of Europe matters to how we are seen, by the world in general and our allies in particular. Any US president I know would regard Britain leaving as folly. The idea we would then seek new relationships with the likes of China and India is an especial illusion. Of course the bilateral relationship with both is strong and of course there are great trading opportunities. But both will never subordinate their Europe relationship to a British one outside of Europe. Our trade with India depends hugely on Europe negotiating the FTA and Germany currently exports more than double what we do to India and to China; and France and even Italy export more to India. Blair also warned that a \"Brexit\" could happen accidentally, through David Cameron's push to reshape Britain's relationship with Europe. That's from Andrew Sparrow's Politics Live blog - more details here. The Financial Times has now uploaded the leaked chart which shows how Greece will miss the revised debt/GDP targets agreed this week, without further debt relief (as discussed at 8.43am) The key is the third column, which shows that Greek debts will be over 126% of GDP in 2020, unless new \"contingent measures\" are taken. The FT's Peter Spiegel explains more here. Details of Bankia's plans to shrink its business, as part of the Spanish bank recapitalisation, have now emerged. Bankia will shut 39% of its branches and intends to cut staffing numbers by 28% over the next three years. Bankia shareholders will also take (another) hit, with dividends frozen until 2014. They will also contribute to the restructuring, with the EU determined that investors share the pain of the \u20ac37bn recapitalisation. (that's via Reuters) Ratings agency Fitch just published its comment on the Greek bailout deal \u2013 saying it should \"strengthen confidence in the fragile Greek banking sector\". However Fitch has concerns, particularly about the Greek debt buyback plan. The size of losses for the banks would depend on their sovereign debt exposure and valuations, which may vary widely for each bank, and the specific terms of the buyback. An acceleration of asset quality deterioration due to the weak economy could increase the banks' capital needs. With limited financial details available, the solvency implication is difficult to assess at present. The full statement is online here. And back in Athens our correspondent Helena Smith says the finance minister Yiannis Stournaras emerged from the prime minister's office where the three coalition leaders were holding talks, looking rather unhappy. She writes: The economics professor emerged from the meeting, where he had briefed the leaders on the agreement reached at the euro group, looking uncharacteristically glum. His words were few. \"I am optimistic. Nothing is easy but we are always trying,\" he said. But as reporters gathered outside were quick to point out, he did not seem so. Stournaras gave an affirmative nod when asked if the leaders had discussed the debt buyback - a central plank of the latest rescue programme for the debt-stricken country - saying \"the buyback will happen\" but remained deliberately opaque as to the details of how it would be conducted. Greek banks, which stand to be the biggest \"victim\" of the buyback, are already grumbling, with analysts also pointing out that after the scheme recapitalisation of the lenders will have to be even bigger than the \u20ac24bn already earmarked for banks in the \u20ac44bn loan for the country. \"The government, it seems, is keeping its cards close to its chest regarding the debt buyback,\" said state-run NET TV's reporter. \"The details continue to remain very vague on this issue.\" Just in - the European commission has announced that it has approved the restructuring of Bankia, NCG Banco, Catalunya Banc and Banco de Valencia. EU competition commissioner, Joaqu\u00edn Almunia, says that the restructuring will cost a total of \u20ac37bn, while \u20ac45bn of toxic assets will be transferred to Spain's new bad bank. Almunia said the plan was: a milestone in the implementation of the Memorandum of Understanding between euro area countries and Spain. The four banks will face pay caps and a ban on acquisitions and, as flagged up at 9.06am, thousands of jobs are to go. Spain's finance minister, Luis de Guindos, is revealing details of the Spanish bank restructuring. Here's some early snaps: It's a big day for Spain's banking sector. The European commission is expected to give its definitive approval to plans to restructure Spain's four nationalised banks, which are receiving \u20ac40bn in bailout cash. Shares in two of the banks - Bankia and Banco de Valencia - have already been suspended this morning. Our Madrid correspondent Giles Tremlett flags up that the quartet will also announce plans to shed thousands of jobs, and reveal how much toxic debt (mainly property loans) will be transferred to Spain's new bad bank. Over in Greece, the three leaders of the country's coalition were due to hold a meeting this morning to discuss how to proceed now the aid deal has been agreed. There's then a cabinet meeting at 1pm local time (11am GMT), which might yield some news. The eurozone crisis continues to grip Spain, with retail sales falling 9.7% year-on-year last month, according to new data. That's the 28th month in a row of declining sales, although Reuters points out that analysts had expected an even worse number (-11.5% was penciled in). Overnight, the head of the Bundesbank has challenged one of the key planks of the deal \u2013 that central banks should give Athens the profits they've made on Greek bonds Jens Weidmann has declared that the German central bank will not hand back its share of the \u20ac11bn of profits unless German MPs give their approval. Weidmann told German newspaper Die Welt: The German parliament decides on the use of the Bundesbank's profit as well as other income of the German federation. This issue could be settled when the Bundestag votes on the whole package later this week. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the eurozone financial crisis, and other key events across the global economy. It's now 32 hours since the Eurogroup announced it had reached an agreement on Greece, and the shine is now coming off the deal. While there is still relief that the immediate danger of Greece not receiving its bailout funds has been averted, there is growing concern that politicians have not been straight with the public over the actual cost of cutting Greece's debt pile. As German financial group Commerzbank puts it: The whole structure of the Greek aid deal intentionally concealed from the taxpayers We will highly likely need to negotiate the sustainability of the Greek debt again in 2014, but a clear haircut now would have been much better with regard to the transparency for the taxpayers. Eurozone finance ministers have insisted that the latest deal does not include any debt forgiveness for Greece. However, the Financial Times is now challenging this, saying it has seen document that show euro governments could be forced to accept losses on their rescue loans. The FT explains: The series of measures agreed, which could relieve Greece of billions of euros in debt by the end of the decade, do not go far enough.... The agreed measures will only lower Greece\u2019s debt levels to 126.6% per cent of economic output by 2020, not the 124% announced by eurozone leaders. This shortfall will be addressed once Greece has a primary surplus: Because the deal already cuts interest on loans to just 50 basis points above interbank lending rates, any further cuts would almost certainly force losses on to eurozone creditors. And that also probably won't happen before 2014 \u2013 after the German elections. Bloomberg is also unimpressed, arguing that this new scheme - Plan C - is really no better than what's gone before. Only full debt relief can help Greece, it argues: When the time comes to craft Plan D, Europe\u2019s leaders would do well to move ahead with the Greek debt writedown they have tried so hard to avoid. If, for example, they cut the government\u2019s debt in half, and if its market borrowing cost could be brought down to about 5 percent, Greece could hold its debt burden steady by running a primary budget surplus (excluding interest payments) of roughly 1.5 percent of GDP - well within the range of what it has been able to achieve in the past. The upfront costs would be greater, but so would the chances of success. The rest of the eurozone probably understands this all too well. As Sky News's Ed Conway puts it: On the basis that if Jean-Claude Juncker denies something, it's probably true, it's worth examining the deal cranked through in Brussels last night to \"save\" Greece.... Were this a private sector loan agreement, the probability is it would be regarded as a technical default. So, the deal's honeymoon is over. As usual, I'll be tracking developments across the eurozone throughout that day.",
