    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "An almost too-heady smell of slightly singed chocolate brownies fills the manicured streets of Alba. On other days this northern Italian town may be enveloped by the scent of strawberry, orange or mint. It all depends on what is happening in a vast factory complex on the edge of town, because Alba is home to Ferrero, the maker of Nutella, Kinder Surprise eggs and, of course, Ferrero Rocher. The family-owned company that began with a small patisserie on a unremarkable backstreet has grown into an \u20ac8.4bn (\u00a36bn) empire which spans 53 countries. It started with a handed-down recipe for the local delicacy of Giandujot, a chocolate and hazelnut block, and turned the Ferreros into Italy\u2019s richest family. Today the company uses a quarter of all the hazelnuts grown across the world, mixed into an ever-growing array of sweet treats. Michele Ferrero, a real-life Willy Wonka who died aged 89 on Valentines Day this year, was the brains behind the company\u2019s varied creations, from the world famous spread and Rochers through to less obvious products such as Tic Tacs. Ferrero has 20 factories worldwide, including one in its home town of Alba. The pale grey outer walls of the factory and network of steel pipes, chimneys and vents puffing out mysterious steam do not give much clue to what goes on within. You could imagine it housing any kind of industrial production from metal widgets to plastic buckets. But the interior is perhaps the closest one can get to a real-life version of Roald Dahl\u2019s fictional factory \u2013 although here it is high-tech machinery, not Willy Wonka\u2019s Oompa-Loompas, that creates 24m Ferrero Rocher chocolates a day. A fifth of Alba\u2019s 30,000 inhabitants are employed in the 340,000 sq m plant but just 64 people work on the main Ferrero Rocher line at any one time, most of those in quality control. A Kinder bar is even more unlikely to pass through human hands. The technology is so secretive that no one is allowed to take a smartphone onto the factory floor and only a handful of journalists have ever been invited inside. Even notebooks must be left at the door. Perhaps it is no surprise that Ferrero guards its secrets so closely: it took Michele five years to work out how to create the sphere of wafer at the heart of a Rocher. The machinery that creates them is a work of art. Sheets of dozens of wafer hemispheres are pressed out by rotating sets of jaws. The sheets arc overhead on wire racks to cool and then delicately bob along on conveyor belts of bright red elastic ropes to the main production line where they are cut out, filled with paste and a whole hazelnut, and turned into balls known as \u201cpic-pocs\u201d. Each pic-poc is then whisked through waterfalls of chocolate and bobbed in beds of chopped hazelnut to create the finished product. It is a surprisingly colourful place. Pipes and barriers are coded in the primary colours of Kinder packaging. Staff wear blue hairnets and Oompa Loompa-esque uniforms in shades of green. The factory offers a sense of the personality of Michele Ferrero. Right up until his last few months he liked to helicopter into Alba from his base in Monte Carlo to work on ideas. \u201cHe liked to say he felt alive because he could invent,\u201d a former colleague says. The company\u2019s research and technology team continues to work on more than 100 new projects kicked off by Michele\u2019s inventive mind. His death prompted fears that the company would lose its creative drive, but his son Giovanni, who had already taken the reins of the business in 2011 after his elder brother Pietro died in a cycling accident, has taken his own bold steps. In June, Giovanni led the \u00a3112m acquisition of Thorntons, the British chocolate maker. It was Ferrero\u2019s first brand acquisition in its 70-year history. The buyout is part of the company\u2019s strategy to find greater success in the UK, where Ferrero is currently vying for fourth place in the confectionery market. In Germany, Italy and France it is No 1 but in Britain it has just a 5% share, putting it well behind Cadbury\u2019s owner Mondel\u0113z, Mars and Nestl\u00e9. But Ferrero\u2019s growth is far outpacing its bigger rivals and accounted for half the total growth in the UK\u2019s confectionery market last year. \u201cWe would like to get to No 1 in the UK but there\u2019s a long way to go,\u201d says Pieraldo Oldano, managing director of Ferrero UK. \u201cWe have a very nice company that has a strong percentage share, in Cadbury, that has been in the market for nearly two centuries. I think the task is not really easy but with most of our products we are not competing directly with other companies. Our products are something different and specific.\u201d . Ferrero\u2019s sales rose by more than 20% last year and the previous year as Nutella launched a takeaway snack with dippers that could be sold in corner shops. The innovation added nearly \u00a312m to the company\u2019s UK sales this year, a considerable chunk given Ferrero\u2019s total sales in the UK were \u00a3259m in the year to August 2014. The Kinder brand has also led growth over the past three years. Oldano says the business has benefited from a desire to cut down on sweet snacks. More than 95% of Ferrero\u2019s products contain less than 150 calories; all Kinder\u2019s are less than 130. \u201cI think part of our success is that parents are more confident to give children a product that is the right size, the right portion and calories,\u201d says Oldano. But sales are also being driven by heavy marketing spending. Pretax losses at the UK business widened to nearly \u00a34m last year from \u00a32.3m in 2013 as it tries to build its brands. The company has also needed to absorb some of the rising price of hazelnuts. A bad harvest in Turkey drove prices up to $18,000 (\u00a311,700) a tonne last spring and they are now at $10,000, still up from a historic level of about $6,000. Ferrero Rocher prices rose 4% last year and will go up about 5% this year in a tough price-led market. The next few months will be a crucial part of Ferrero\u2019s plans as it works out how to get the most from Thorntons while trying for the biggest Christmas sales of its chocolate pralines. Nearly two-thirds \u2013 61% \u2013 of annual sales of Ferrero Rochers are made during the last three months of the year. In the run-up to Christmas Ferrero expects to sell more than 130m Rochers in Britain \u2013 enough for two per person. Last year the figure was 120m. Despite their rather old-fashioned image, forever linked to the ambassador who is \u201creally spoiling us\u201d, sales last year rose 17%. \u201cTo succeed at Christmas means to succeed in the whole year,\u201d says Oldano. \u201cIf you don\u2019t succeed then it will be difficult to recoup the business and competition is very tough. Everybody wants that business.\u201d Sugar tax \u2018incorrect way to fight obesity\u2019 \u2013 Ferrero chief Sugary sweets are already taxed more than many other types of food and focusing on one ingredient is not the right way to fight obesity, according to the UK boss of Ferrero. A government-backed report published this week urged ministers to impose a sugar tax and crack down on the marketing of unhealthy products to children, but Pieraldo Oldano argued that most confectionery and chocolate is already subject to 20% VAT, higher than most other foods. Consumption of sugar per head in the UK fell 17% between 1992 and 2013, he said, but obesity rates have risen. \u201cWe as a company think obesity must be fought with three main actions. We must eat a balanced diet with a variety of products, we must eat the right quantity and we must exercise. To focus on one ingredient is the incorrect way to fight obesity,\u201d he said. Oldano added that Ferrero was doing its bit by selling sweets in small portions and backing sports initiatives for young people in schools. \u201cThe problem is intake and outgoing of calories. If you do not balance what you take with what you eliminate you become obese.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "For the first time in 15 years, Volkswagen\u2019s quarterly accounts have landed in the red. Results published by the German car giant on Wednesday showed a loss of \u20ac3.5bn (\u00a32.5bn) for the three months until 30 September \u2013 the month when the emissions scandal erupted. VW set aside \u20ac6.7bn to deal with the fallout from the 11m vehicles worldwide whose diesel engines were secretly programmed to cheat tests and mask the pollution they caused, although the final bill could run into tens of billions. Yet VW\u2019s underlying sales are reportedly robust \u2013 and while the company has apologised and spoken of its mission to regain trust, it still expects to ride out the storm. Six weeks after one of the world\u2019s biggest ever corporate scandals broke, how has the world changed for the other players in the story? The campaigners Brussels-based thinktank Transport and Environment had warned for years about rigged tests but few listened before September. Jos Dings, its director, laughs: \u201cI could say it changed everything overnight, but in the first vote two days ago on real driving emissions, some of our dearest member states \u2013 including Britain and Germany \u2013 stuck, in an inexplicable way, to short-term measures.\u201d The European commission has delayed more stringent tests by a year, allowing engines to emit more than twice the legal limit of nitrogen oxides until 2021. Dings says: \u201cThat was the first concrete test and a very disappointing one.\u201d But, he says: \u201cWe have more friends than we used to \u2013 people recognise that we got this right. We are a very small outfit, and there are hundreds of lobbyists from the car manufacturers running round here, so it\u2019s bloody hard work.\u201d Andrew Pendleton, head of campaigns at Friends of the Earth, says the crisis changed things \u201cfor a short time\u201d, but the story never quite got to the issue of air pollution. \u201cFor me, what sums it up is the statement of [VW chief executive Matthias] M\u00fcller in his first conference: \u2018No one died\u2019. But knowingly putting vehicles on the road that issued more toxic pollutants than they should have will have led to many more deaths. People have died because of VW\u2019s actions, but also because of the negligence and intransigence of the regulator and the politicians.\u201d He hopes the scandal will give new opportunity to campaigners: \u201cWe can ally with motorists who\u2019ve been done \u2013 a lot of them bought vehicles they thought were cleaner \u2013 and all air-breathing citizens. People are waking up to the risks.\u201d Richard Lloyd, executive director of Consumer group Which?, says almost 70,000 people have now signed up to their Come Clean on Fuels campaign for rapidly overhauled, independent testing. \u201cThis scandal has rocked trust in the motoring industry, with over three-quarters of drivers saying they want new testing brought in as soon as possible to restore confidence in manufacturers\u2019 claims.\u201d The motor industry British demand for diesel cars appeared to remain strong in the immediate aftermath, according to September registration figures from the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT), but there is not enough data yet to be sure, says David Bailey, professor of industrial strategy at Aston University. \u201cThe big issue is whether it heralds a shift away from diesel \u2013 and that\u2019s going to take a while to play out. It\u2019s a seismic moment for the industry and particularly the big European manufacturers who have done a lot of work on diesel: technologically, they have they made the wrong bet.\u201d Some analysts believe fears of brand damage in Europe are overstated but Bailey says: \u201cIn the US it\u2019s very different: VW have killed their diesel market and it has left them in a very difficult position.\u201d For British manufacturer Jaguar Land Rover, the timing of VW\u2019s woes was ominous, as it unveiled two new diesels in America. However, a spokesman said: \u201cWe did launch the Range Rover Td6 and Range Rover Sport Td6 in late September as planned and while it is too early to tell what, if any, long-term impact there will be on the US market, we are pleased with the early sales.\u201d In the UK, one major car dealership, Lookers, reported continuing profit growth on Friday, leading the City analysts at Peel Hunt to conclude: \u201cWhile some suggested that the VW crisis would have a major impact on the motor trade, [this] suggests that its progress remains strong ... the VW nerves are now soothed.\u201d The shareholders VW shares lost around one-third of their value in the first two days of trading after news of the scandal broke, and remain at roughly the same level now. Simon Dluzniak, of lawyers Bentham Europe, says his firm is one of several close to finalising claims on behalf of global investors for damages from VW for non-disclosure of critical information. Some reports have suggested that the damages could reach \u20ac30bn; Dluzniak is more cautious but says it could \u201crun into billions of euros\u201d. Some shareholders on Bentham\u2019s books \u2013 institutions not individuals \u2013 have lost millions. Meanwhile, ShareAction, a pressure group that co-ordinated letters from major investors requesting greater clarity on lobbying, says VW\u2019s actions has prompted other shareholders to scrutinise companies. Chief executive Catherine Howarth said: \u201cThe scandal has drawn attention to the need for investors to practice active stewardship over the companies they invest in, to avoid plummeting share prices as a result of reputational risk.\u201d The lawyers London-based Leigh Day has now registered around 6,500 potential clients who drive affected vehicles with a view to a class action for compensation. An official said: \u201cIt\u2019s hugely interesting for us, and we\u2019ve brought in more people to deal with the workload. But we remain frustrated: we\u2019d have expected VW to have told their customers exactly how they\u2019d solve this issue by now. When you strip everything away, there\u2019s very little information. People are worried.\u201d The VW drivers Owners of affected vehicles should be compensated for the reduction in value, the transport secretary, Patrick McLoughlin, said this week. But British drivers remain a long way from reassured. Simon Jacobs, 53, an employee engagement consultant from Hammersmith, London, bought his first new car, a Golf Cabriolet VW, in April 2014 for \u00a325,000. \u201cIt was sold to me as the greener choice. I\u2019m bothered that it\u2019s many times more toxic than they\u2019d said. The letter from VW that came to me and 1.2m others about two weeks ago made me furious. I wanted them to say sorry, we lied to you \u2013 but we\u2019re a long way off that. It doesn\u2019t offer to change your engine or your car, which is worth a fraction of what I paid for it and is poisoning people.\u201d While motor industry estimates of the drop in value for affected VW brands have been in the region of 2% to 5%, others believe their prices have plummeted. Another driver of an affected Seat vehicle, who has been trying to sell his car and did not want to be named, said: \u201cIt\u2019s blighted. The valuation services are wildly inaccurate and don\u2019t have a bearing on the reality of resale.\u201d Meanwhile, drivers are taking action to clean up their own engines: Halfords said that sales of fuel additives to tackle diesel dirt have trebled in the last month.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Government attempts to contain the mounting UK steel crisis have been dealt a further blow after Caparo Industries announced 452 job losses. Caparo entered administration on 19 October and the cost-cutting measures announced on Friday include the immediate closure of five sites as the steel products company fights for survival. The biggest job losses were at a factory in Darlaston, West Midlands, where 122 workers were made redundant, with the remaining redundancies at sites across England and Wales. The cutbacks at Caparo capped a grim month for the British steel industry, with thousands of jobs lost or put at risk due to the plunging price of steel, high energy costs and the strong pound making exports expensive. Anna Soubry, the minister for enterprise and industry, said: \u201cThis will be a very upsetting time for the hundreds of Caparo workers and their families affected by today\u2019s announcement.\u201d PwC had said its aim was to stabilise Caparo and look for opportunities to save the business, but it concluded that certain parts of the company were no longer viable. It said Caparo, founded by the Labour peer Lord Paul in 1969, still employs more than 1,200 people, who are working as usual while the administrator examines the available options. Matt Hammond, Caparo\u2019s lead administrator, said: \u201cIt is with regret that we have made these decisions today, but the commercial prospects of the affected businesses render them unviable.\u201d The steel industry, unions and Labour MPs have accused the government of inaction following the closure of the Redcar steel plant on Teesside with the loss of 2,200 jobs, Caparo\u2019s administration, and the mothballing of Tata steel mills in Scunthorpe and Scotland that led to 1,200 redundancies. The three events threaten the jobs of more than one in six workers in Britain\u2019s already depleted steel industry. Sajid Javid, the business secretary, said last week there was little the government could do about the price of steel, the strength of sterling or EU rules on state aid for industries. But under heavy pressure as job losses and closures have mounted, the government has engaged in a flurry of activity this week. On Wednesday, Javid visited Brussels to press the case for European Union action to support the steel industry, including against the alleged dumping of cheap steel by China. The prime minister also promised to pay backdated compensation for high energy costs to struggling steel producers. The government published new procurement guidelines on Friday for government departments to encourage the use of British steel on big projects such as the HS2 high-speed rail link and Network Rail upgrades. George Osborne, the chancellor, also launched a new infrastructure commission to coordinate spending on large public projects. Gareth Stace, director of the UK Steel lobby group, said his response when the government announced the procurement standards was: \u201cThat was great, but why didn\u2019t it happen three years ago?\u201d Stace said the government\u2019s actions helped demonstrate a change of thinking that would give steel companies more long-term confidence but that on energy prices, business rates and unfair trade, \u201cthere could be actions in the short term where we see results in the short term\u201d. The Unite union said the closure of Caparo\u2019s Darlaston factory near Wolverhampton was the second blow to manufacturing in the area after Goodyear announced the closure of its tyre-making plant in June with the loss of 300 jobs. Other Caparo factories to close were in Hartlepool, with 79 job losses; in Dudley, West Midlands, where 64 will be made redundant; Fairbright Wire in nearby West Bromwich, where 59 people will lose their jobs; and a tubes facility in Tredegar, south Wales, which employed 17 people. At Oldbury, in the West Midlands, where Caparo is based, 68 employees will lose their jobs, with further cuts in Wrexham and at other locations. Workers were paid until the end of Friday and will get support in claiming redundancy and notice payments, PwC said. Anna Soubry, who pledged last week to create a \u201clevel playing field\u201d for the UK steel industry to compete against foreign rivals, said help would be offered to redundant Caparo workers. Tony Burke, assistant general secretary of the Unite union, said: \u201cThe failure of the government to intervene to support the steel industry and develop an active industrial strategy is leaving the industry on the brink. If we are to avoid more grim news like today\u2019s, then George Osborne needs to keep his promise about jobs, growth and making Britain fit for the future the central mission of the infrastructure commission.\u201d",

The three events threaten the jobs of more than one in six workers in Britain\u2019s already depleted steel industry.</p> <p>Sajid Javid, the business secretary, <a href=\"http://nws.press/1yuP/cameron-urged-challenge-chinese-president-over-uk-steel-job-losses\">said last week there was little the government could do</a> about the price of steel, the strength of sterling or EU rules on state aid for industries. But under heavy pressure as job losses and closures have mounted, the government has engaged in a flurry of activity this week.<br></p> <p>On Wednesday, Javid <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/oct/28/steel-workers-marchparliament-sajid-javid-talks-eu-redcar-tata\"> visited Brussels</a> to press the case for European Union action to support the steel industry, including against the alleged dumping of cheap steel by China. The prime minister also promised to pay backdated compensation for high energy costs to struggling steel producers.</p> <p>The government published new procurement guidelines on Friday for government departments to encourage the use of British steel on big projects such as the HS2 high-speed rail link and Network Rail upgrades. George Osborne, the chancellor, also <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/oct/30/george-osborne-infrastructure-november-spending-review-national-commission\">launched a new infrastructure commission</a> to coordinate spending on large public projects.</p> <p>Gareth Stace, director of the UK Steel lobby group, said his response when the government announced the procurement standards was: \u201cThat was great, but why didn\u2019t it happen three years ago?\u201d<br></p> <p>Stace said the government\u2019s actions helped demonstrate a change of thinking that would give steel companies more long-term confidence but that on energy prices, business rates and unfair trade, \u201cthere could be actions in the short term where we see results in the short term\u201d.</p> <p>The Unite union said the closure of Caparo\u2019s Darlaston factory near Wolverhampton was the second blow to manufacturing in the area after <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/jun/25/goodyear-to-close-wolverhampton-manufacturing-plant-330-jobs-at-risk\">Goodyear announced the closure of its tyre-making plant</a> in June with the loss of 300 jobs. </p> <p>Other Caparo factories to close were in Hartlepool, with 79 job losses; in Dudley, West Midlands, where 64 will be made redundant; Fairbright Wire in nearby West Bromwich, where 59 people will lose their jobs; and a tubes facility in Tredegar, south Wales, which employed 17 people. At Oldbury, in the West Midlands, where Caparo is based, 68 employees will lose their jobs, with further cuts in Wrexham and at other locations. </p> <p>Workers were paid until the end of Friday and will get support in claiming redundancy and notice payments, PwC said. Anna Soubry, who <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/oct/27/time-running-out-for-uk-steel-industry-trade-chief-tells-ministers\">pledged last week to create a \u201clevel playing field\u201d</a> for the UK steel industry to compete against foreign rivals, said help would be offered to redundant Caparo workers. </p> <p>Tony Burke, assistant general secretary of the Unite union, said: \u201cThe failure of the government to intervene to support the steel industry and develop an active industrial strategy is leaving the industry on the brink. If we are to avoid more grim news like today\u2019s, then George Osborne needs to keep his promise about jobs, growth and making Britain fit for the future the central mission of the infrastructure commission.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "Leading US environmental campaigners have joined a diverse line-up of pressure groups to demand a federal investigation into allegations that the oil giant ExxonMobil illegally covered up the truth about climate change. Earlier in the week, first Bernie Sanders and then Hillary Clinton, the leading Democratic presidential candidates, called for the US government to announce an official investigation. On Friday morning, 350.org, an environmental movement, issued a letter signed by climate campaigners, civil rights organizations, indigenous people\u2019s groups and others, calling on US attorney general Loretta Lynch to investigate. The letter cited \u201crevelations that the company knew about climate change as early as the 1970s, but chose to mislead the public about the crisis in order to maximize their profits from fossil fuels\u201d. The letter was signed by groups such as the Environmental Defense Fund, Friends of the Earth, the Natural Resources Defense Council, Greenpeace and the Sierra Club, as well as bodies such as the Indigenous Environmental Network, which promotes environmental and economic justice issues affecting indigenous communities. The Foundation of Women in Hip Hop, which has a stated goal of \u201csharing a love of the arts\u201d and influencing perceptions about the roles of women involved with hip-hop music, also signed the letter. So did the National Audubon Society, which seeks to protect birds and their habitats, and the Ecumenical Poverty Initiative, which aims to \u201cmobilise the faith community to end the scandal of poverty in the US\u201d. Leaders of the 49 campaign groups signed the letter, which charged: \u201cThe corporation knew about the dangers of climate change even as it funded efforts at climate denial and systematically misled the public.\u201d The appeal for action was lent extra weight by the signature of James Hansen, now the director of the climate science awareness and solutions programme at the Columbia University Earth Institute in New York but previously a climate researcher for Nasa for more than 30 years. There, he raised the alarm about climate change and became one of the world\u2019s most renowned scientists in the field. The letter also cites an investigation by Inside Climate News and further revelations by the Los Angeles Times which accused ExxonMobil of deception over global warming and the influence of humankind and fossil fuels. The letter continues: \u201cGiven the damage that has already occurred from climate change \u2013 particularly in the poorest communities of our nation and our planet \u2013 and that will certainly occur going forward, these revelations should be viewed with the utmost apprehension. They are reminiscent \u2013 though potentially much greater in scale \u2013 [of] similar revelations about the tobacco industry.\u201d Members of Congress have called for a federal investigation. Eight days ago Sanders, a Vermont senator, echoed such calls and accused the company of lying about climate change since the 1970s. On Thursday, Clinton, the Democratic frontrunner, added her voice. Responding to a question about whether the company should be investigated, she said: \u201c Yes, yes, they should. There is a lot of evidence they misled.\u201d Hansen, however, recently called Clinton\u2019s proposed climate initiative \u201csilly\u201d. It focuses more on subsidies for solar panels and renewable energy than on pricing out fossil fuel use. ExxonMobil has denied any wrongdoing.",

The 16-year-old boy was arrested in Feltham, west London, Metropolitan police said on Friday. He was released on bail until a date yet to be confirmed. His arrest followed that on Monday of a a 15-year-old boy in Co Antrim, Northern Ireland, on suspicion of offences under the Computer Misuse Act. He has also been bailed, until a date in November. The 16-year-old\u2019s Feltham home was searched during the arrest on Thursday, as was another residential property in Liverpool. TalkTalk has 4m customers whose bank details and personal information were feared at risk from the attackon its website, which took place a week ago. However, the company said on Friday that the data hacked was significantly less than originally suspected. It said fewer than 21,000 unique bank account numbers and sort codes had been accessed and fewer than 1.2m customer email addresses, names and phone numbers. Fewer than 28,000 obscured credit and debit card details and 15,000 customer dates of birth had been accessed. TalkTalk\u2019s chief executive, Dido Harding, said: \u201c\u201cGiven the potential size of this attack, we decided to be as open, honest and transparent as we could because we wanted to keep our customers informed and ensure they had the advice and support they need. Today, we can confirm that the scale of attack was much smaller than we originally suspected, but this does not take away from how seriously we take what has happened and our investigation is still ongoing. \u201cOn behalf of everyone at TalkTalk, I would like to apologise to all our customers. We know that we need to work hard to earn back your trust and everyone here is committed to doing that.\u201d TalkTalk has stressed the credit and debit card details cannot be used for financial transactions, as they have the middle six digits missing. The company said it had shared the affected account details with the major UK banks so they could take action to protect customers in the event of attempts to defraud them. The company described the prospects of such attempts as \u201chighly unlikely\u201d. A spokesman said: \u201cEven though the scale of the attack is significantly smaller than initially suspected, we continue to advise customers to be vigilant, and to take all precautions possible to protect themselves from scam phone calls and emails.\u201d The company said it would not call or otherwise contact customers regarding this incident, requesting bank details or other financial or personal information. The cyber-attack is the third to hit TalkTalk in the past eight months, with incidents in August and February also resulting in customers\u2019 data being hacked. Security experts have claimed the telecoms firm let down customers with its slow and poor reaction and failure to encrypt and secure data. However, Harding insisted that the company\u2019s cybersecurity was \u201chead and shoulders\u201d better than its competitors, while conceding that it would be \u201cnaive\u201d to rule out the prospect of Talk Talk suffering a similar attack in the future.

The celebration is the UK\u2019s second-biggest party night after New Year\u2019s Eve, say analysts at Conlumino, and some supermarkets expect a sales boost of up to 20% this year because the event falls on a Saturday. The retail industry is keen to promote Halloween as shoppers have proved increasingly willing to spend more around an event. Tesco\u2019s Halloween buyer, Bryony Watson, said: \u201cHalloween has doubled in size over the past 10 years. As this one falls on a Saturday, we believe it could be the biggest the UK has ever seen.\u201d Halloween has grown in popularity in the UK and easily accounts for more spending than bonfire night. Parties were once focused on children, but Watson said adults were increasingly prepared to dress up. Asda said it had more than tripled its stocks of costumes this year and bought nearly 60% more makeup as it expected Halloween sales across all categories to rise by 20%. Sainsbury\u2019s said it had bought 30% more adult costumes than last year and 22% more non-food Halloween-related products. Angels Fancy Dress, the UK\u2019s largest costume hire company, said it expected to ring up more than \u00a32m of sales over Halloween, slightly up on last year and more than double the amount taken in 2007. Costumes based on the Mexican Day of the Dead, zombies, the grim reaper and the 1980s film Ghostbusters are expected to be the most popular. Although Emma Angel, director of the family-run business, said banana outfits were also proving popular for men. \u201cHalloween has grown and grown. There are various reasons for that. When I was growing up we used to watch a lot of American TV and my generation has become very Americanised. Those programmes always had Halloween parties and people have adapted to that,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen I was small people used to have firework parties in the back garden. Now they are more likely to go to a display. But everyone can get involved in Halloween whether you are five, 20 or 80.\u201d Supermarkets are the main beneficiaries of the trend, with Asda the biggest seller of costumes in the UK. The Walmart-owned retailer also expects half of all adults to buy Halloween food, 10% more than last year. Asda is selling pimply pumpkins, known as bumpkins, toffee apples and monster-themed cakes as well as costumes for the whole family \u2013 including the dog. \u201cWe look to our cousins over the pond at Walmart to ensure we bring the big American Halloween trends on to shelves for Brits. Putrid purple chillies and bumpkins are just the start,\u201d said Charlie Mills, fresh produce category manager at Asda. The market for pumpkins has grown in line with the rising popularity of spooky celebrations and the industry is worth about \u00a36m, according to the trade journal The Grocer. An estimated 10m pumpkins are grown in the UK every year. Sainsbury\u2019s expects its customers to buy just over 1m in the week leading to Halloween. The supermarket said sales of pumpkins were up 11% year on year in its supermarkets, with tiny munchkin and pimply superfreak varieties up 28% and 56% respectively. The wet weather and mild summer meant the crop was slower to turn from green to orange, prompting fears of a shortage. But the late September sunshine hasallayed such concerns. But Morrisons is stocking 500,000 green pumpkins to prevent the crop from being wasted. David Bartle, the retailer\u2019s pumpkin buyer said: \u201cWe don\u2019t want British farms to suffer because of slightly poorer summer weather conditions. We are also not in the business of wasting good food.\u201d Ebay said that, inspired by TV show The Walking Dead, zombie costumes lead the way, with more than 28,000 sold in the past two weeks \u2013 more than 2,000 a day. The bestselling costumes include zombie prom queen, zombie sailor and a zombie nurse. Meanwhile, fans of the Vampire Diaries have pushed vampire costumes into second place, with sales on eBay.co.uk hitting 45 per hour. Nearly 16,000 Halloween costumes are being sold every day on Ebay\u2019s UK site. Halloween costume ranking on ebay.co.uk (by sales volume) 1. Zombies 2. Vampires 3. Witches 4. Clowns 5. Ghosts",

      "bodyText": "British Airways\u2019 parent company, International Airlines Group (IAG), has raised its profit forecast after a bumper summer, buoyed by what it described as rapid improvement in key European economies. The group made \u20ac1.2bn (\u00a3850m) after tax in the last quarter \u2013 the most lucrative for airlines. That was 70% more than in the same period a year ago, nudged up by the acquisition of Aer Lingus in mid-August. IAG announced on Thursday it would pay a dividend to shareholders for the first time since it the company was created by the 2011 merger of BA and the Spanish airline Iberia. The payout will be 10\u00a2 per share, and the company confirmed it would propose a full-year dividend for 2015 that would be a quarter of the underlying profit after tax. Willie Walsh, IAG\u2019s chief executive, said he expected that to be around \u20ac400m. Walsh said the group\u2019s operating profit for the year could now reach \u20ac2.3bn. He said the outlook was good for IAG in its base markets, with London remaining strong and better prospects in Ireland and Spain, home to Vueling as well as Iberia. \u201cThe Spanish economy is improving significantly and there is rapid recovery in Ireland,\u201d Walsh said. Aer Lingus had benefited particularly from the strength of the transatlantic route, he added; Dublin acts as a hub for European-US traffic, with the airline launching three additional direct US destinations. Walsh ruled out any imminent acquisitions for the group, despite rumours it has been considering a bid for Finnair as part of its strategy of consolidation. He said the Finnish state-owned airline had \u201cchallenges\u201d, adding: \u201cWe are not active on any front, we know Finnair very well as part of our transatlantic joint business \u2026 We\u2019re not in any discussions.\u201d Walsh reiterated his warnings over Heathrow, whose third runway may be approved in principle later this year by the government as it responds to the Airports Commission\u2019s recommendation. \u201cI\u2019m not objecting to it being expanded \u2013 if the airport wants to build it, I would look to it to fund it. We don\u2019t go to the customers that we fly with and say we want to buy stuff next year and therefore we\u2019re going to ask you to pay for it, even though you\u2019re not going to use it. \u201c[Heathrow] should not look to airlines to pay for something that they won\u2019t be using and won\u2019t be there for 10 years or so.\u201d Meanwhile, Walsh said the prospect of Ryanair acting as a short-haul feeder into the IAG airline network was growing nearer, after a series of \u201cfine\u201d discussions with the controversial Irish no-frills carrier. \u201cWe\u2019ve no principled objection to the feeder model. The critical issue is having commercial terms that are acceptable to all parties \u2026 We see no reason to object to people flying with Ryanair to connect to Aer Lingus.\u201d He said there were several markets that Ryanair served, particularly Poland, that could be opened up by such an agreement. \u201cIf we can work in a collaborative commercial fashion in the interests of consumers we should. But we\u2019ve not agreed anything at this stage.\u201d He said there was no likelihood of a similar arrangement between BA and Ryanair as the Irish carrier does not operate out of Heathrow. Walsh said that trading would be weakest in the coming quarter, but dismissed talk of revenues being impacted by a \u201cfare war\u201d promised by Ryanair boss Michael O\u2019Leary. \u201cMichael says that every winter,\u201d he said.",

      "bodyText": "Time for a quick recap. Economists are expecting the European Central Bank to press on with fresh stimulus measures, even though the eurozone has escaped deflation for the second time this year. The consumer prices index has inched back to zero this month, according to eurostat, from 0.1% in September. Lower energy costs continued to drag the cost of living down. Europe\u2019s jobless crisis has eased a little, with the unemployment rate across the EU hitting a six-year low. Spain has posted another quarter of solid expansion, although growth slowed to 0.8% from 1%. Japan\u2019s central bank governor has vowed to do more, if necessary, to get the country\u2019s inflation rate back to target. Haruhiko Kuroda made the pledge after the BoJ lowered its growth and inflation forecasts. A move could come in December, analysts say. Angela Merkel has predicted that China\u2019s economy will avoid a very hard landing, on a trip to the country. And Portugal\u2019s president has defended asking former PM Pedro Passos Coelho to form a new government, rather than his left-wing rivals. Passos Coelho\u2019s administration has just been sworn in, but could be kicked out next month at a crunch confidence vote. And that may be all for today, but we\u2019ll be back if there are any huge developments.... If not, have good weekends all. GW The latest US economic data just hit the wires, and paints a mixed picture of the world\u2019s largest economy. American household spending rose by just 0.1% in September, down from 0.4% in August, and only half as fast as economists expected. But US labour costs have risen by 0.6% during the last quarter, up from 0.2% in the previous three months. That\u2019s a broad measure of pay, suggesting salaries are rising as the employment market continues to tighten. So on balance, it doesn\u2019t really settle the debate on whether US interest rates will go up before Christmas (as covered in the intro). The global slowdown has rippled across to Canada. Canadian GDOP rose by only 0.1% in August, data just released showed, down from 0.3% in July. That follows this week\u2019s trend of slowing growth in the last quarter (in the UK, the US and Spain). It\u2019s the third monthly expansion in a row in Canada, following contractions earlier in the year. On an annual basis, the economy was only 0.9% bigger than 12 months ago. Over in Lisbon, Portugal\u2019s new government is being sworn in after a general election that produced no clear winner. It means Pedro Passos Coehlo remains as prime minister, but leading a minority government. Portugal\u2019s president sparked controversy by asking Passos Coehlo to form the next administration, even though left-wing parties won a majority of seats between them. This sparked talk that a coup had been perpetrated. But in truth, the wheels of democracy will keep turning. The opposition will get their chance to kick Passos Coehlo out of office early next month, in a vote of confidence on the new government\u2019s policies. Merkel has used her China trip to call for more protection for Europe\u2019s steel industry, which has been ravaged by falling prices and overcapacity. Over to Reuters\u2019 Andreas Rinke: At a German-Sino business congress in Hefei, Merkel calledfor better protection of the steel and solar industries against unfair international competition, a complaint some manufacturers make against China. Merkel said the steel sector needed \u201ca certain amount of market protection\u201d as steelmakers have pointed out that environmental regulations differ from country to country,impacting cost advantages. \u201cI also hope that we can extend the rules already in placein the solar sector,\u201d she added. Angela Merkel also had an opportunity to pass on some football tips to the next generation today, during a trip to a primary school in Xin Nan Cun. Angela Merkel has also predicted that China\u2019s economy will avoid a crash, during her trip to Hefei today. She told journalists: \u201cI think one can expect that China\u2019s growth will be a bit weaker, but that it will have constant growth. \u201cIt is obvious that particularly the domestic demand through growing cities is an important factor to stimulate consumption and here with growth.\u201d This is Merkel\u2019s eighth visit to China since becoming Germany\u2019s leader a decade ago, underlining the importance of the links between Berlin and Beijing. Angela Merkel has been hard at work building closer trade links with China. The chancellor has put worries over Germany\u2019s economy, and Europe\u2019s escalating refugee crisis behind her. And the latest photos from the trip suggest it\u2019s going well. Merkel got a warm welcome from students at Hefei University in Hefei, capital of east China\u2019s Anhui Province.... ...and then shared a drink with Chinese Premier Li Keqiang, using beer brewed by the students #cheers Merkel also told reporters that Germany favours granting China \u201cmarket economy status\u201d - a shift that would make it harder for the EU to protect local industry from Chinese competition. However, Beijing still \u201chas to do some homework, for example in the area of public procurement,\u201d she added (Reuters reports) And she also met a group of children in the Baohe district of Hefei: Mario Draghi will be pleased to see the eurozone clamber out of deflation this month, but it only takes a little pressure off his central bank. Last week, the ECB chief hinted that more stimulus could be needed soon, as inflation remained sharply off course. Bill Adams, senior international economist at PNC Financial Services Group, believes Draghi will make an announcement at its next meeting: The ECB\u2019s most likely next move is to announce an extension in December of the duration of its quantitative easing program to last through March 2017. But hawks on the Governing Council may point to an exit from deflation as a reason for the ECB to continue with asset purchases in 2016, but without as clear a pre-commitment as they made in 2015. This would provide the ECB with discretion to begin a taper of its easing program earlier than expected if inflation surprises to the upside due to pass-through of higher import prices or higher food prices (unprocessed food prices rose 3.0% from a year earlier in October). No time like the present, eh?.... Unemployment in the wider European Union has hit a six-year low of 9.3%, even better than the 3.5 year low of 10.8% in the eurozone: But that still leaves 22.631 million men and women out of work in the 28 countries which make up the EU. Eurostat explains: The EU28 unemployment rate was 9.3% in September 2015, down from 9.4% in August 2015, and from 10.1% in September 2014. This is the lowest rate recorded in the EU28 since September 2009. But this is still far, far too high -- almost twice the levels in the UK and the US. And many countries are still lagging behind. The highest rates were recorded in Greece (25.0% in July 2015) and Spain (21.6%) -- a reminder that the Spanish recovery hasn\u2019t fully fed through to its labour market. The lowest were recorded in Germany (4.5%), the Czech Republic (4.8%), Malta (5.1%) and the United Kingdom (5.3% in July 2015). It\u2019s almost a year since oil prices began to tumble on the world markets, giving the global economy a deflationary squeeze. The impact of cheap oil should soon start to drop out of the annual inflation rates, though (as prices will no longer be cheaper than a year ago). And that could send consumer prices indices up again.... This is the second time this year that the eurozone has shaken off a bout of negative inflation: Europe\u2019s unemployment crisis has eased a little, in another little boost to the region. Eurostat reports that the overall jobless rate dropped to 10.8% in September, down from 10.9% in August. That\u2019s lower than economists had expected, and is the lowest level since January 2012. Although the eurozone\u2019s inflation rate was zero in October, that masks wide differences across the economy. Today\u2019s eurozone inflation data shows that food prices rose by 1.5% year-on-year in October, while service sector costs were up by 1.3%. Other goods prices only rose by +0.4%, while energy costs slumped by 8.7%. So on average prices were unchanged (as the economist with one foot in a bucket of scalding hot water and the other foot in a bucket of ice might put it) The eurozone has emerged from deflation! Prices across the single currency region were flat in October, having shrunk by 0.1% the previous month. That\u2019s broadly in line with forecast, and shows how little inflationary pressure there is in the eurozone (due to weak energy prices). Core inflation (which strips out volatile elements such as energy and food) across the eurozone rose to 1% - well below the ECB\u2019s 2% target. European stock markets are subdued this morning, as investors wait for the latest eurozone inflation and unemployment data in 25 minutes. The FTSE 100 has lost 5 points, or just under 0.1%, while the French and German markets are up just 0.15%. But still, fears that we could suffer a grim October have not come to pass, with most indices posting strong gains this month: Looking back at Japan...some economists believe the BoJ may beef up its stimulus package in November, when it meets again. By then, they should have new growth figures showing whether Japan\u2019s economy shrank in the last quarter, or not. Mitsuo Shimizu, deputy general manager of Japan Asia Securities Group, says: \u201cThey could move after the next meeting - expectations for more easing aren\u2019t going away.\u201d But there\u2019s also an argument for waiting until the US central bank\u2019s next meeting in December. If the Fed does hike interest rates, then the yen will weaken against the US dollar without the BoJ needing to do anything.... Italy\u2019s unemployment rate has dipped to its lowest point since January 2013 but still remains worryingly high. New data shows that the Italian jobless rate fell to 11.8% in September, from 11.9% in August, suggesting prime minister Matteo Renzi\u2019s reform plan may finally be bearing some fruit. It\u2019s better than economists expected. In 50 minutes time we get the overall eurozone unemployment report.... Spain\u2019s recovery has been partly due to a strong tourist season, which helped it overcome the housing crash. The FT\u2019s Ian Mount explains: Record spending by foreign tourists has helped speed Spain\u2019s recovery from a double dip recovery that began after its real estate bubble popped in 2008. Tourists injected \u20ac53.8bn into the economy over the first nine months of 2015, 6.3 per cent more than in the same period in 2014. Capital Economics fears that today\u2019s GDP report shows Spain\u2019s \u2018impressive\u2019 recovery is faltering a little: Holger Sandte of Nordea Markets is concerned that Spain\u2019s building and housing sector is still in the mire: Spain\u2019s economic recovery continues, although at a slightly lower speed. The Spanish statistics body reports that GDP rose by 0.8% in the last three months, compared to 1% in the second quarter of this year. On an annual basis, the economy grew by 3.4%, up from 3.1%. This is the 9th consecutive quarter of growth in Spain, which has been one of the best performing European economics since the debt crisis eased in 2012. Spain is the first eurozone country to report growth figures (we get most of the data in two weeks time). Today\u2019s numbers mean it is growing faster than the UK, which reported a GDP increase of 0.5% on Tuesday. It also beats America\u2019s annualised rate of 1.5% (which is &lt;0.4% on a quarter-on-quarter basis). Reaction to follow.... Governor Kuroda is also trying to dampen fears over China\u2019s economy, and its impact on Japan. He says he agrees with the IMF that the slowdown in China could last longer than expected, which would be bad for Japanese trade: Many Japanese companies operate in East Asia so their profits may also be affected. But he\u2019s still optimistic that the region\u2019s economies are resilient enough to cope: Our main scenario is for the global economy to recover moderately, driven by the strength in advanced economies.\u201d Here\u2019s some instant reaction to BoJ governor Haruhiko Kuroda\u2019s comments: The Bank of Japan has fuelled speculation that it could soon announce fresh stimulus measures, after cutting the Bank\u2019s inflation and growth forecasts. Governor Haruhiko Kuroda has just told a press conference that the BoJ has more ammunition at its disposal, as it battles against the deflationary pressures gripping the globe. Kuroda insisted that the BoJ could still hit its target of getting inflation to 2% (even it is is taking longer than hoped), saying: \u201cWe won\u2019t hesitate to make necessary policy adjustments if we judge that there is a change in the broad price trend.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m not thinking of raising or lowering the current 2% inflation target.\u201d And on the details of monetary policy, Kuroda declared: \u201cI don\u2019t think there are limits to our policy options.\u201d Kuroda was speaking after the BoJ left its current stimulus programme unchanged at its latest policy meeting, despite evidence that Japan hasn\u2019t shaken off the spectre of deflation. The BoJ also cut its forecast for real economic growth for the current fiscal year to 1.2% from 1.7%. It also kicked back the target for hitting 2% inflation to the back end of 2016, or even early 2017, from the middle of next year. Some analysts had thought the Bank might boost its 80 trillion yen annual asset-buying scheme today, but Japan\u2019s policymakers are hopeful that the global economy will pick up. But there are signs that more may be needed. New figures showed that consumer prices fell 0.1% in the year to September, a second monthly decline, while household spending slid 1.3 percent from a year earlier. More here: Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. It looks like another busy day for economic news, as policymakers, analysts and the public all ponder the state of the global economy as the year grinds towards its close (just 55 sleeps till Christmas, folks!) In Europe, the latest inflation data come at 10am GMT. It may show that prices stopped falling in the eurozone, after dropping by 0.1% in September. We also get European unemployment figures - likely to show that the eurozone jobless crisis is still severe: There\u2019s also a flurry of data coming our way from across the Atlantic. That includes US personal spending stats at 12.30pm and the University of Michigan confidence report at 2pm GMT. They\u2019ll both provide more ammunition for the ongoing debate about whether the Federal Reserve will take the plunge and raise interest rates at its December meeting (just 47 sleeps to go!). Canada will become the latest major economy to report growth figures - economists predict that growth slowed to 0.1% in August from 0.3% in July. And in the City, it\u2019s quite busy for a Friday. BG Group, the oil company, has been hit by the weak crude price: And Royal Bank of Scotland has suffered an operating loss of \u00a3134m in the last quarter, after taking a \u00a3847m charge to cover restructuring costs. It still managed to post a net profit though: More details on that later, along with all the main events through the day....",

But George Osborne has a lot of lost ground to make up, according to a new analysis of construction data revealing a fall in infrastructure activity across the northern powerhouse region. Infrastructure activity fell in London and across the combined regions where Osborne wants to create a network of northern cities to \u201ctake on the world\u201d, according to an analysis of the latest construction data by Scape Group, a public sector-owned building consultants. Scape also found the northern powerhouse regions recorded the strongest growth of any region in new homebuilding activity in the year to June. In contrast, London\u2019s housing activity grew by less than 1% over those 12 months. Here are five trends the report highlights: Infrastructure activity falls across \u2018northern powerhouse\u2019 Although many of the cities in thenorthern powerhouse region benefitted from major road and rail projects, such as those around Manchester, Warrington and Preston, infrastructure activity overall across the area fell on the previous year, the report said. Activity on infrastructure projects in Wales and Scotland was up significantly \u2013 with Wales doubling its spend on infrastructure, according to the analysis which was based on the most recent regional construction data from the Office for National Statistics. London takes lion\u2019s share of overall construction activity When looking at the whole construction sector, including areas such as infrastructure and housing, London made up the biggest share of construction sector activity in the year to June. When taken together, the northern powerhouse regions almost match London, however. Construction activity across north-west England, north-east England and Yorkshire and the Humber was \u00a329.21bn in the last year, just \u00a31.12bn less than London\u2019s total construction output of \u00a330.3bn, the report said. Scotland records fastest growth Scotland experienced the biggest overall growth in the UK, with construction activity rising by more than 20% on the previous year. \u201cNew housing and public sector work drove Scotland\u2019s boom in construction activity, with the Scottish government\u2019s steady pipeline of new projects providing plenty of work for Scottish contractors in the run-up to the May 2015 general election,\u201d the report said. \u201cDespite large increases in housing activity, Yorkshire and the Humber saw the biggest fall in construction activity overall,\u201d the report added. Although Wales doubled its infrastructure output during the year, large reductions in the construction of private housing and private commercial buildings led to a small overall fall in output. Northern housing boom Overall housebuilding was up more than 8% on the previous year, driving the wider construction sector. There was a housebuilding boom in the north of England and collectively the northern powerhouse regions increased construction output in housing by 30%, the analysis found. Public sector housing fall bodes ill for London affordability There was a north-south divide on the balance between public and private housing. In south-east England, construction of public sector housing fell by 25% in the year to June, while in London there was a 32% fall. \u201cLondon and the south-east had the lowest levels of housebuilding activity in the public sector. With rental prices continuing to rise rapidly, more affordable housing is particularly needed in London and the south-east \u2013 this decrease in activity suggests fewer affordable units will be available in the next 12 months,\u201d the report said.",

      "bodyText": "Annual sales at Starbucks are set to break through the $20bn mark this year \u2013 enough to buy a tall latte for everyone on the planet. The world\u2019s biggest coffee chain, headquartered in Seattle, is booming after improvements to food menus and service along with the launch of new drinks such as the Toasted Graham Latte. Comparable sales \u2013 at cafes that have been open for at least a year \u2013 rose 8% in the firm\u2019s fourth quarter, beating analysts\u2019 expectations. Half of that increase was due to customers paying more frequent visits to Starbucks cafes, the Seattle Times reported. But Starbucks shares fell 3% as it became the latest company to warn about the effect of the strong dollar, which it said would hurt profits in its key holiday quarter. Sales rose 17% to a record $19.2bn (\u00a312.5bn) in the year to the end of September, and are set to reach $21bn in 2016 \u2013 roughly equivalent to every person on the planet buying a tall latte, which costs an average of $2.95 in US. Annual operating profits were up by 19% to $3.7bn. The group did not break out its UK performance but earlier this year reported its first profit in the UK for 17 years. Along with other multinationals, Starbucks has come under fire for how little tax it pays in the UK. Last week, the European commission ruled that the company\u2019s sweetheart tax deal with Dutch tax officials amounted to unlawful state aid. Starbucks said it would appeal. The company said sales were unexpectedly strong in the Americas and the company\u2019s Europe, Middle East and Africa division in the last quarter. But Asia disappointed as the Chinese economic slowdown sent ripples through the region. The KFC and Pizza Hut parent company, Yum Brands, has also been hit by China\u2019s woes. However, Starbucks said it had not seen a broad-based slowdown in China and still expected the world\u2019s most populous country to become its largest market outside the US, with 3,400 cafes planned by 2019. The chief executive, Howard Schultz, said service improved in the US after Starbucks raised staff pay and improved benefits. It introduced new delivery services and a app that allows customers to skip the queue by ordering and paying for their drinks with their smartphones. He added: \u201cStarbucks is playing the long game.\u201d After being launched at US stores in late September, the company has started rolling out Mobile Order &amp; Pay at 150 London cafes in the UK and 300 locations in Canada. Neil Saunders, the chief executive of retail consultants Conlumino, said the app could lead to an increase in impulse purchases, which were easier to make via the app. Starbucks would also benefit from improved efficiencies through reduced waiting times and higher throughput, which was likely to boost profits. \u201cWe are also encouraged by Starbucks\u2019 plans to increase the productivity of stores in another way: by driving evening sales through offering alcoholic beverages and an enhanced food menu,\u201d he said.",

Sales rose 17% to a record $19.2bn (\u00a312.5bn) in the year to the end of September, and are set to reach $21bn in 2016 \u2013 roughly equivalent to every person on the planet buying a tall latte, which costs an average of $2.95 in US.

Along with other multinationals, Starbucks has come under fire for how little tax it pays in the UK. Last week, the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/oct/21/starbucks-and-fiat-tax-deals-with-eu-nations-ruled-unlawful\">European commission ruled that the company\u2019s sweetheart tax deal with Dutch tax officials</a> amounted to unlawful state aid.

      "bodyText": "Royal Bank of Scotland faces a a mounting bill for mis-selling and other conduct issues , its new chairman has warned just days before the government gets a fresh opportunity to resume selling its stake in the bank. Sir Howard Davies, who became chairman of the 73% taxpayer-owned RBS in September, said several obstacles remained before the bank fully recovered from its \u00a345bn bailout by taxpayers in 2008. Davies listed three main areas that posed a risk. He cited a long-running case in the US about the way it sold mortgage-backed bonds before the financial crisis, the payment protection insurance mis-selling scandal and the ongoing investigation by the City regulator into the way its now-defunct global restructuring group treated small businesses. \u201cSince 2008, RBS has gone through a very difficult period, and there are still quite a few obstacles to be overcome before we\u2019re back to full health,\u201d Davies said. Presenting his first set of figures since becoming chairman, Davies made clear he backed the strategy being adopted by the bank\u2019s management, led by Ross McEwan, the chief executive. McEwan has been reversing the global expansion that RBS embarked upon before its near collapse, withdrawing from 25 countries in a move expected to take a heavy toll on jobs. Approximately 900 posts have been lost since a year ago, reducing the number of staff to 92,400. \u201cThe years of global domination are over,\u201d McEwan said. He had hoped to have settled a long-standing case in the US over mortgage bonds but is still awaiting a court date. Legal documents in the US have suggested this bill could reach over \u00a38bn. McEwan also said he hoped the investigation commissioned by the Financial Conduct Authority into its small businesses restructuring arm will be completed this year. The inquiry relates to accusations raised by businessman Lawrence Tomlinson, who accused RBS of pushing businesses to the brink. The bank could face a compensation bill. \u201cWhile legacy issues continue to be addressed, material and further incremental costs and provisions in respect of conduct and litigation-related matters are expected, and could be substantially greater than the aggregate provisions RBS has recognised. The timing and quantum of any future costs, provisions and settlements, however, remain uncertain,\u201d the bank said, as it reported a fall in nine-month profits. Its shares were down 1% at 317p in Friday\u2019s early trading,below the 502p average price at which taxpayers bought the stake in the bank. The stake was reduced from 79% in August when the government starting selling its shares for the first time. Its 90-day, self-imposed lock-in to sell more shares ends on Monday, although there is speculation that the government might wait until the result of stress tests on the industry in December before selling mroe shares. Pre-tax profits fell from \u00a33.3bn to \u00a3295m over the first nine months of the year. In the third quarter it made an an operating loss of \u00a3134m, compared with a \u00a31bn profit a year earlier. The figures were knocked by \u00a31.4bn of legal charges, compared with \u00a31bn a year ago, and \u00a32.3bn of costs to restructure the bank. The bank is also moving closer to removing the dividend blocking the share owned by the government \u2013 which means the Treasury must receive any payouts before any other shareholders \u2013 as a result of selling off its last remaining stake in Citizens, the US bank. Overnight, the last remaining shareholding in Citizens was sold off for \u00a31.6bn, a disposal mandated as part of its taxpayer bailout and a further unravelling of the empire created by Fred Goodwin, who led the bank up to its taxpayer rescue. The bank indicated the proceeds could be used to cancel this dividend access share. It is also expected to ask shareholders permission to use any surplus capital to buy back shares directly from government - although this is not likely to happen until 2017. McEwan justified the closures of more than 386 RBS and NatWest branches by pointing to the growth of digital banking. The bank\u2019s branch network will shrink further next year when it carves out more 300 branches under the Williams &amp; Glyn brand to comply with terms set out by the EU at the time of the bail out. The bank is releasing bad debt provisions it has made in the past, largely as the Irish property market improves.",

October marked a five-month low on a barometer of consumer mood from the market research group GfK, while a separate survey of retailers by the business group CBI showed sales had undershot expectations following a strong September. GfK\u2019s headline consumer confidence measure dipped to +2 in October from +3 in September. Consumers were gloomier about the economic situation over the last 12 months and over the coming year, according to the poll of 2,000 people, conducted for the EU. The survey also found people were less certain over whether now was a good time to make major purchases such as furniture or electrical goods. \u201cThe good news on the domestic front \u2013 with households lifted by wage growth, low interest rates and near-zero inflation \u2013 is being tempered by concerns about our ability to shrug off the global downturn,\u201d said Joe Staton at GfK. The news follows reports that businesses are being hit by weaker demand as the global economy loses steam and UK consumers worry about interest rate rises and more government spending cuts. Official figures this week showed UK GDP growth eased in the July-September quarter. The CBI\u2019s indicator of retail sales volumes signalled the slowest growth for six months in October. Its survey of 112 firms, which assesses the sector based on a balance of companies\u2019 responses, showed 38% said volumes were up on a year ago, and 20% said they were down. That gave a balance of +19%, compared with +49% in September. Retailers had expected a reading of +51%. But sales were regarded as above average for the time of year and growth was expected to improve next month. Growth in orders placed upon suppliers was also lower than expected but remained above its long-run average. Internet sales volumes accelerated in the year to October, with growth set to pick up further next month, the CBI said. The business group said low inflation and improving wages meant the prospects for sales growth were \u201cdecent\u201d, but there were still challenges including the weakening global economy and price competition between retailers.",
