    "webTitle": "Loss-making RBS to give millions in shares to executives", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Royal Bank of Scotland is poised to release millions of pounds worth of shares to its top executive team through bonus schemes put in place by the loss-making bank over the last three years. The scale of the bonuses scheduled to be handed out could be known on Friday \u2013 the usual date for the release of RBS bonus shares \u2013 as the bank will need to announce to the stock market how many it is releasing to executives. The release of the shares share award will put a fresh focus on the pay policies of the 81% taxpayer-owned bank \u2013 where losses since the financial crisis have now surpassed the \u00a345bn of taxpayer money used to prop up the bank. It also comes days after Barclays boss Antony Jenkins admitted he had to pay multimillion pound bonuses to investment bankers to avoid a mass exodus of staff sending the division into a \"death spiral\". Last week RBS announced that Rory Cullinan \u2013 recently promoted to run its newly created mini-bad bank \u2013 had sold shares and exercised options worth \u00a31.1m. RBS's disclosures about Cullinan were the first since he was promoted to the executive team assembled by new boss Ross McEwan, who took the helm of the bailed out bank on 1 October. Cullinan previously ran the non-core division of the bank but was not part of the executive committee, made up of the most senior executives outside the boardroom. This meant previous awards of shares to Cullinan did not have to be disclosed, but his promotion to run the new so-called capital resolution group required the bank to release details of any share payments to him. McEwan has reorganised his executive committee in a series of moves since he took the helm, culminating last week in the promotion of Alison Rose to run the commercial and private bank and Donald Workman to run the Asian businesses. In January McEwan ordered that members of the committee waive their bonuses for 2013 before he announced \u00a38.2bn of losses last week, but that move would not affect those recently promoted \u2013 Rose, Cullinan and Workman \u2013 who are still in line for share bonuses for last year. Last week McEwan defended the need to pay bonuses and refused to reveal how the bank intended to handle the EU's cap on bonuses, which has led other banks to hand \"allowances\" of shares to top staff. RBS is yet to publish its annual report which will provide more detail about its pay policies, including how many staff were paid over \u00a31m. It has been reported that up to 80 staff \u2013 compared with 95 last year \u2013 will have been paid over \u00a31m. The bank has several bonus schemes many of which pay out between March 7 and 9 and date back a number of years. As a result of the complexity of the schemes and the changes to senior management, the value of the series of bonuses due to be released is difficult to calculate before the bank's announcement as they are subject to performance conditions. Former boss Stephen Hester and former head of the US operation Ellen Alemany are among those in line for payments, though the bank is under no obligation to confirm payments to past directors. A few remain, notably, Bruce van Saun, former finance director, who has relocated to the US to prepare the operation for a stock market flotation; his successor as finance director Nathan Bostock, who was promoted internally but is in the process of leaving for Spanish bank Santander; and long-serving employee Chris Sullivan, who was last week named deputy group executive. As Bostock is leaving, it is thought unlikely he will get the shares. Any shares being handed to Hester \u2013 now boss of the insurer RSA \u2013 are under the terms of the package agreed at the time of his resignation in June when the bank said the maximum value of any share plan would be \u00a34m in coming years. It is thought unlikely be will receive that amount.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "International Airlines Group chief executive Willie Walsh quintupled his pay last year with salary and bonuses of almost \u00a35m, at a time when pilots and crew in Iberia were taking swingeing pay cuts. Walsh took a performance-related bonus for 2013, according to the airline's annual report, having passed one up the previous year as the group formed by the controversial merger of British Airways and Spanish flag carrier Iberia made a loss. However, a recent agreement with unions appeared to have ended the threat of industrial action and reconciled Spanish staff to Walsh's restructuring plan, which has seen thousands of jobs cut at the struggling airline and other staff agreeing to downgraded pay and conditions. Last week IAG returned to the black as it reported full-year profits of \u20ac227m (\u00a3186m), with Iberia having curbed its losses \u2013 it had been losing more than \u20ac1m a day at its bleakest point after the merger. The acquisition of Spanish low-cost carrier Vueling has also bolstered the group's finances while the integration of Bmi has firmed up BA's position at Heathrow. In the report, Walsh said: \"I look back on last year with a sense of real pride and achievement for what people within IAG have done to put the business on a more secure footing.\" He said he was targeting operating profits of \u20ac1.8bn by 2015, and claimed: \"We continue to prove the critical logic of merging British Airways and Iberia through the cost and revenue synergies we are achieving.\" He said that these savings were now exceeding IAG's original targets. IAG's share price has trebled in the last 18 months, boosting Walsh's claims to have turned the group around. He received a \u00a31.3m bonus with long term share awards worth \u00a32.6m vesting, on top of \u00a3825,000 in salary and around \u00a3250,000 in pension and benefits. Keith Williams, the chief executive of British Airways, was paid \u00a33m. Iberia's boss, Luis Gallego Mart\u00edn, took a 15% voluntary cut. Spanish pilots union Sepla said that the pay rise for Walsh seemed \"exaggerated\" when its members had taken a 14% pay cut. Gallego also passed up his potential bonus of \u20ac630,000. However, Walsh's bulging pay packet is still less than the sum taken by EasyJet chief executive Carolyn McCall this year. A combination of salary, annual bonus and long-term incentives payments to the boss, who joined in 2010, saw the budget airline pay out \u00a36.5m to McCall. Baroness Kingsmill, the chair of the IAG remuneration committee, said: \"Once again, the chief executive of IAG has continued to lead by example in proposing restraint in executive packages.\"",

      "bodyText": "John Lewis has stolen the UK high street crown from Marks &amp; Spencer after sales in Britain overtook the high street bellwether for the first time. The success was two-fold as both parts of the staff-owned retailer, Waitrose and John Lewis, cemented their status as middle-England's favourite shopping destination with record sales. \"John Lewis has definitely replaced M&amp;S as the darling of the British high street,\" said retail analyst Neil Saunders of Conlumino. \"M&amp;S is still the more predominant \u2013 it has more stores and more shoppers \u2013 but when you look at new routes to market like online and mobile John Lewis is light years ahead.\" The new heights scaled by the partnership are good news for its 91,000 staff \u2013 known as \"partners\" \u2013 who will share a bonus pool of more than \u00a3200m in this month's pay packet. Every member of staff from the chairman to Saturday shelf-stackers gets the same level of bonus \u2013 which has this year been set at 15%, or about eight weeks' pay. A decade ago, sales at John Lewis Partnership were just \u00a35bn, while M&amp;S was in a different league with around \u00a38bn. Those lines have now crossed. The most recent figures available show M&amp;S's UK business turning over \u00a38.9bn last year, compared to the \u00a39bn John Lewis and Waitrose achieved this year. M&amp;S is not expected to eclipse John Lewis when it publishes more up-to-date figures in May. This year's sales were boosted by the retailer's hugely successful Christmas advertising campaign \u2013 the Bear and the Hare cartoon \u2013 which became a YouTube sensation with 12.4m views. It also benefited from the demise of Comet \u2013 which meant it sold far more electrical goods than ever before \u2013 and the upturn in the housing market which has boosted demand for new carpets and curtains. In the past John Lewis was unfavourably compared with the civil service. It was slow to adapt to changing shopping habits such as late night shopping, Sunday trading and even accepting credit cards. But it did not make the same mistake with the internet. Both chains have invested heavily in their website and the click and collect services that many time-pressed customers now take for granted. M&amp;S, meanwhile, is playing catch-up with the recent relaunch of its website. The latest savvy developments include Waitrose installing grocery collection lockers in London underground stations while John Lewis is backing a Silicon Roundabout-style technology incubator \u2013 called \"JLab\" \u2013 which it hopes will come up with the next big thing for its stores. Unlike the toxic issue of bankers' bonuses there is no backlash from the public or politicians or members of the public when John Lewis doles out its annual staff bonus. Although small beer compared with payouts received by investment bankers \u2013 last month Barclays said its bonus pool was more than \u00a32bn \u2013 the payout is equal to 15% of salary. John Lewis staff earn the same as shopworkers at rival chains but the year-end bonus is a significant top-up. This year the average payout is \u00a32,225 and for some it can be life changing. Darren Hayes, who works in Waitrose's Aylesford depot, is using the extra cash to send his son nine-year-old Darragh, who has cerebral palsy, to the Peto Institute in Hungary for a course of intensive physiotherapy. \"It's life-changing for me \u2013 100%,\" says Hayes. \"I'm convinced he will walk out of there.\" John Lewis became a partnership in 1929 when John Spedan Lewis established a trust committed to sharing profits among staff. The business's values, which include \"putting the happiness of partners at the centre of everything we do\", have not always been fashionable but the formula of rewarding staff \u2013 on top of the bonus staff will receive discounts and perks ranging from subsidised holidays to sailing clubs and theatre outings worth \u00a3120m this year \u2013 went from strength to strength during the recession. \"Both Waitrose and John Lewis increased market share for the fifth consecutive year,\" said chairman Charlie Mayfield. \"Our ownership by partners played a key role in these results. There are fundamental changes taking place in retail \u2026 the level of change has at times been challenging but partners have understood and embraced the need for their business to continue to develop.\" Rivals such as Next, and M&amp;S, are far more profitable than John Lewis but Iain Hasdell, chief executive of the Employee Ownership Association, says that is only one yardstick with which to measure success. \"John Lewis is a good antidote to how much of our economy is externally controlled and driven by the obsessive short-termism that creates a significant financial breakdown every generation.\" Some mock the middle class values of the John Lewis brands - two years ago a Waitrose Twitter campaign which invited shoppers to \"finish the sentence: 'I shop at Waitrose because \u2026'\" went awry with memorable comments such as: \"because I was once in the Holloway Road branch and heard a dad say 'Put the papaya down, Orlando\". But it has not stopped them shopping there. As big supermarkets such as Tesco and Asda lose shoppers to German discounters Aldi and Lidl, Waitrose, led by Mark Price, has been holding its own thanks to a promise to match market leader Tesco's prices on brands and a loyalty scheme that offers free newspapers and coffee. \"I asked my mother if she had shopped at Aldi or Lidl\", said Price. \"She said yes, at Aldi. She bought four hub caps and a pack of carbon monoxide detectors.\" He said Waitrose had decided on a \"very British response\" .\"We have decided to compete on giving our customers morning coffee and a cup of tea in the afternoon.\" His latest thinking includes introducing concierge desks to welcome shoppers and tapas bars in its wine departments. It was not all plain sailing. Profits before the bonus and tax were down 4% at \u00a3329m after a \u00a347m charge for compensating staff who had been underpaid for holidays. The bonus was down from last year's 17% figure as the retailer also tackled a \u00a31bn black hole in its pension scheme. The holiday pay error has led to questions about the checks and balances in place at the partnership, given the backdrop of implosion at the Co-op where trust was shattered by the rescue of its bank and the Reverend Paul Flowers drugs allegations. \"Our governance structure is completely different to that of the Co-op group,\" insisted Mayfield. \"The group is owned by the partners and they are represented on the board and there are also non-executives. We are very careful that our governance is in good and improving shape\u2009and we are not taking undue risk.\" John Lewis Partnership v M&amp;S Sales: \u00a310.2bn v \u00a310bn Profit: \u00a3376.4m v \u00a3564.3m Staff: 91,000 v 82,000 UK stores: 344 (304 Waitrose) v 766 Boss's basic pay (2013): Sir Charlie Mayfield \u00a3825,000 (\u00a3140,000 bonus) v Marc Bolland \u00a3975,000 (\u00a3829,000 bonus)",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Sharon Bowles has taken on the banks \u2013 and the government \u2013 in pushing through the European legislation that has introduced the cap on bankers' bonuses. But the Liberal Democrat MEP, who in a 2012 survey was ranked the most influential Briton in EU policymaking, refuses to get angry at high street banks' attempts to circumvent pay limits by awarding \"allowances\" to top staff. Stuart Gulliver, chief executive of HSBC, is receiving the equivalent of \u00a332,000 extra a week in shares in order to evade a cap that limits bonuses to 100% of salary, or 200% if shareholders grant their approval. Bowles, who has chaired the European parliament's economic and monetary affairs committee since the height of the financial crisis, says she is relaxed about the effectiveness of a system that launched on 1 January. \"I am happy for large sums to be shown in fixed pay and fixed overheads so shareholders can see the truth; it is a more honest structure.\" Aren't the banks simply thumbing their nose at the EU regulators? \"I don't know,\" she says, adding that she is \"relaxed\" about part of a chief executive's salary reflecting their responsibilities. In contrast her Belgian colleague, Philippe Lamberts, who is regarded as the architect of the cap, is angling to take Britain to court for letting the banks bend the rules. But Bowles says the bonus cap has worked. Most of the industry's bonus pot is paid to \"ordinary mortals\" on \u00a320,000-\u00a330,000 a year and is better described as basic pay, she argues, so the cap has resulted in these bonuses being converted back into basic pay. But, she warns, future parliamentarians may decide to tighten the rules. \"If they [the banks] want to do a little bit of thumbing their nose at the legislators to say well you can't stop us anyway, it is probably not the best thing to do because the next thing that will happen is that there will be tighter rules written about allowances.\" Taking a break between meetings at the National Liberal Club in Whitehall, Bowles says she is not seeking to change the bonus cap legislation, but acknowledges that \"what angers a lot of people is that the overall sum, no matter what it is called, is too big. And to be honest there is nothing you can do about that unless there is rehabilitation of banking in general back to the ranks of normal.\" That is still some way off, she said. \"I think the nature of banking will change: it is going to be harder for the banks to be able to engage in risky structures,\" she says, citing plans to separate risky investment banking from high street operations. These are the fundamental reforms that matter, she argues, rather than \"the bit on the side\" about bonuses. Before getting involved in negotiating the bonus cap she helped devise new ground rules for the eurozone, after the whole project came near to collapse. In another country this kind of experience would make her a formidable front-runner to be a European commissioner, a powerful job in the prime minister's gift, but in Britain those same European credentials probably rule her out. \"There are lots of people in lots of places who suggest it. The one place I have never heard it suggested is in Westminster. Anything but,\" she says. She became high profile enough to apply to become governor of the Bank of England before the role went to the Canadian Mark Carney. \"I was not really expecting that I would get the job,\" she says. Bowles, who studied physics before founding a patent attorney firm with her husband, would not only have been the first woman, but also the first non-economist or City type in the bank's modern history. \"They daren't take someone who hasn't been in a bank, they just daren't,\" she says. She is alarmed that regulators are creating a new breed of \"too-big-to-fail\" institutions, by squeezing risk out of the banks and into clearing houses that act as middleman to buyers and sellers of shares. These little-known businesses known as central counterparties, such as London's LCH Clearnet, will gain responsibilities to clear a large part of the $700tn (\u00a3418tn) worth of financial derivatives currently traded outside exchanges. \"We are all quite worried about central counterparties. I think they are undercapitalised. \"There is a tendency in central banking to say we could never let a central counterparty go down, so we have now got too-big-to fail central counterparties, which is not a good position to be in \u2026 I don't think it would be right to say it would be another financial crisis, but certainly it would cause a lot of ructions.\" But she will not be there to regulate them. Bowles is standing down as an MEP before the European parliamentary elections in May, after nine years of late-night meetings and endless shuttling between Brussels, Strasbourg and the huge South East constituency. In her time she has seen the UK's influence change, she says, especially since British Conservative MEPs were forced to leave the main centre-right group in 2009, following a promise David Cameron made when he was running to be party leader. \"We no longer have eyes and ears within the largest political group,\" she says \u2013 which leaves the government with \"secondhand information\" and excluded from pre-summit gatherings with other centre-right leaders such as Angela Merkel. Her British Conservative colleagues have had to work harder to gain trust, she reckons. \"There is a dislike for our anti-Europeanism and the Conservative party is seen as being much more anti-European perhaps than it really is.\" A vote to leave would be \"a disaster\" and only the start of wrangling over the terms of exit. \"What happens at the end of that negotiation if it has gone badly? Do you have another referendum so we can change our mind once we have really discovered what it means to go. \"It is a lot less clear than everything we still don't think is clear about the Scottish referendum. Not least because there are 27 [member states] to negotiate with.\" She could be a voice in any yes campaign, and meantime expects to pick up a few non-executive roles. Returning to the theme of change in high finance, she asks: \"What is going to make our banks change the most? It will be when we finally get round to changing their boards so that they do have the kind of diversity that one expects, and a diversity of views. If you look at the top, it is still a world of grey men.\" Sharon Bowles CV Age 60.

Bowles is standing down as an MEP before the European parliamentary elections in May, after nine years of late-night meetings and endless shuttling between Brussels, Strasbourg and the huge South East constituency.</p> <p>In her time she has seen the UK's influence change, she says, especially since British Conservative MEPs were forced to leave the main centre-right group in 2009, following a promise David Cameron made when he was running to be party leader.</p> <p>\"We no longer have eyes and ears within the largest political group,\" she says \u2013 which leaves the government with \"secondhand information\" and excluded from pre-summit gatherings with other centre-right leaders such as Angela Merkel.</p> <p>Her British Conservative colleagues have had to work harder to gain trust, she reckons. \"There is a dislike for our anti-Europeanism and the Conservative party is seen as being much more anti-European perhaps than it really is.\"</p> <p>A vote to leave would be \"a disaster\" and only the start of wrangling over the terms of exit.</p> <p>\"What happens at the end of that negotiation if it has gone badly? Do you have another referendum so we can change our mind once we have really discovered what it means to go.</p> <p>\"It is a lot less clear than everything we still don't think is clear about the Scottish referendum. Not least because there are 27 [member states] to negotiate with.\"</p> <p>She could be a voice in any yes campaign, and meantime expects to pick up a few non-executive roles.</p> <p>Returning to the theme of change in high finance, she asks: \"What is going to make our banks change the most? It will be when we finally get round to changing their boards so that they do have the kind of diversity that one expects, and a diversity of views. If you look at the top, it is still a world of grey men.\"</p> <h2><strong>Sharon Bowles CV</strong></h2> <p><strong>Age</strong> 60.</p> <p><strong>Education</strong> Our Lady's Convent, Abingdon; Reading University (chemical physics with mathematics); Lady Margaret Hall, Oxford University (research into semiconductors).</p> <p><strong>Career</strong> After starting her career as a trademark agent and patent attorney, Bowles established a new patent and trademark practice in 1981.

    "webTitle": "Buoyant housing market puts Help to Buy in the spotlight", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "House prices roared to their highest February rise on record last month, fuelling concerns that the UK's booming property market could undermine the stability of the recovery. Halifax reported that prices rose by 2.4% in the usually quiet month, to take the annual rate of increase to 7.9% \u2013 its highest since 2007. The Lloyds bank subsidiary said the housing market was improving following a sharp rise in transactions over the last year based on improving consumer confidence and cheap mortgage deals. The price jump sparked calls for the government to cancel its Help to Buy scheme, which critics argue has artificially inflated prices and encouraged speculation in London and the south-east. Rob Wood, chief UK economist at Berenberg bank, said: \"I think the housing market is doing fine without Help to Buy. It is already recovering rapidly, helped by very low interest rates and the better economic situation, and simply does need any extra stimulus, if it ever did.\" Wood, a former Bank of England economist, said the chancellor should use the budget later this month to cancel the programme, which has allowed first-time buyers with only small deposits to get mortgages previously restricted to existing homeowners. The rise in prices came as the Bank of England's interest rate setting committee kept base rates at 0.5%. Rates have now been at this historic low for more than five years, with the Bank signalling that businesses and homeowners should not expect a rise until next year. Calls for the European Central Bank to follow Threadneedle Street's lead and print cheap money under a quantitative easing programme met with a sharp rebuff from ECB president Mario Draghi. Speaking after the ECB's governing council held the currency zone's main interest rate at 0.25%, Draghi said economic conditions across the 18 member countries were improving and it remained \"an island of stability\". Draghi was expected to take action to halt falling inflation across the eurozone. Last month prices rose by just 0.8% and there are fears of deflation taking hold. At his January news conference he said he feared that consumers were beginning to expect low inflation for the foreseeable future and Europe could enter a Japanese-style period of stagnation. However, figures showing improved retail sales and higher manufacturing production, especially in Spain and Germany, appear to have persuaded him that a broad-based recovery is under way. The only blot on the horizon was a protracted dispute over Crimea with Russia, which he said could wreak terrible damage on the eurozone's growth prospects. The UK has also seen prices calm down from last year, when inflation topped 3%. Last month the consumer prices index (CPI) fell to 1.9%. Analysts at Capital Economics said they expected inflation to hit 1% by the end of the year. The consultancy said interest rates would remain low to maintain consumer confidence and boost demand. Samuel Tombs, one of the firm's UK economists, said house prices were likely to continue rising, though only gently. He dismissed fears of a house price bubble, saying that the sharp rise in lending over the last year to fund mortgages was offset by a high level of repayments. Halifax said the average house price across the UK increased to \u00a3179,872, though the average price in London is more than double this figure. However, the Halifax data does not count cash purchases and is skewed away from the south-east. A recent Land Registry report showed that homes in the capital commanded an average price of is \u00a3409,881 in comparison with the average for England and Wales of \u00a3168,356. Stephen Noakes, mortgages director for Halifax, said there were factors which should help to keep a lid on house prices. He said: \"Continuing pressures on household finances, as earnings fail to keep pace with consumer price inflation, are expected to remain a constraint on the rate of growth of house prices. \"We are also seeing signs of a revival in housebuilding, which should help bring supply and demand into better balance and curb upward pressure on prices over the medium and longer terms.\"",

William Stobart, the third son of Eddie Stobart, who founded the firm in the Lake District in the 1960s and is now 84 years old, will become the boss of Eddie Stobart Logistics, the trucking and distribution arm that is being spun out of the Stobart parent company. Stobart Group is selling 51% of the lorry business to William Stobart and Isle of Man investment firm DouglasBay Capital. The parent company will retain 49% of Eddie Stobart Logistics and, crucially, the rights to the famous brand. William Stobart is standing down as a director of Stobart Group to become chief executive of the new firm and will own 6% of the company. It will be the first time a member of the Stobart family has been the boss of the lorries that bear their name since Edward Stobart, Eddie's second son, who built the business into a household name, sold the firm in 2004. Based in Carlisle but run from a head office in Soho Square, London, it was sold to William Stobart's best friend and former brother-in-law, Andrew Tinkler, for an undisclosed sum. Tinkler went on to expand the business into other activities, ranging from biomass energy projects to running Southend airport. The company was listed on the stock market in 2007, valued at \u00a3138m. Edward Stobart, who had run the company since 1973, died in bankruptcy in 2011. Tinkler, a serial entrepreneur who owns a private jet and 45 thoroughbred horses, is still chief executive of Stobart Group and owns 9.45% of the company. Tinkler has known the Stobarts since he was a child and got a job washing the company's lorries. After leaving school at 15 he tried his hand at joinery, sheep farming and double-glazing. He went on to found his own building company, WA Tinkler, where William Stobart joined him. Tinkler and William Stobart married two sisters, but both relationships have soured. He said it was good that a Stobart would once again be the boss of the lorry empire. \"It gives William a chance to step up,\" he said. \"He's a very good operator.\" Tinkler said the sale of half the trucking business would help return cash to shareholders, pay down debts and fund investment in the company's rail, air and biomass businesses. \"We are handing some money back to shareholders. Shareholders will get a good return.\" The trucking business, whose biggest customer is Tesco, made a profit of more than \u00a325m last year. Stobart Group will invest \u00a355m of the sale proceeds in its biomass business, spend \u00a335m on a share buyback and repay \u00a3100m of debt. The company has struggled to impress City investors and in 2012 Neil Woodford, then star fund manger at Invesco and Stobart's biggest investor, insisted the company appoint Avril Palmer-Baunack, who had turned around the vehicle hire group Helphire, to reorganise the company. She quit after just 10 weeks.",

      "bodyText": "The pay of Bob Dudley, BP's chief executive, tripled last year despite the legal threats still hanging over the company from the Deepwater Horizon disaster. The oil boss received $8.7m (\u00a35.2m) in salary, bonus and share awards last year, according to the company's annual report, compared with $2.6m in 2012. When contributions to his pension were included, Dudley, 58, got $13.2m for 2013 and has already accumulated a retirement package worth $2m a year. The American took over at BP towards the end of 2010 after the exit of Tony Hayward, who led the group during the disastrous blowout in the Gulf of Mexico. BP has already paid out billions in compensation for the worst environmental accident in US history and could yet be found guilty of gross negligence by the US department of justice, which could bring penalties of up to $20bn. It has also failed in court to stop what it believes are \"absurd\" compensation payments to victims who do not need to prove financial loss from the spill. The share price has recovered from the immediate aftermath of spill but, at 486p, it is still far below the 650p it had reached just before the disaster in 2010. The company is also facing potential difficulties after taking a 20% stake in Russia's largely state-owned oil group, Rosneft last year, given the threat of sanctions against Moscow over the Crimea crisis. But the company said Dudley had taken steps to re-establish a good financial and safety record since he had been in charge. \"BP has made strong progress over the past three years under Bob Dudley's leadership \u2013 particularly in areas such as safety, operations and building for the future through reserve replacement \u2013 and his remuneration reflects this,\" said a BP spokesman. \"The great majority of his potential pay is directly dependent on BP's performance in areas essential both to the delivery of the company's strategy and to the long-term interests of its shareholders.\" City analysts have praised Dudley in recent times for putting more emphasis on the interests of investors with a focus on dividends and share buybacks. \"Others tell this story but we suspect BP 'gets it' (the need to maximise returns for investors) more than most, given its travails in recent years,\" said Investec Securities in an equity note this week. But the oil and gas analyst Neil Morton retains a \"hold\" recommendation on the BP shares and a target price of 460p per share. Dudley has already disposed of around $40bn of assets and in October BP said that it expected to sell off a further $10bn of assets by the end of 2015, with the proceeds largely used to fund share buybacks. The new BP prides itself on being smaller and more streamlined with a decision earlier this week to hive off its onshore oil and gas assets in the US into a separate business to be run autonomously. Dudley has not ruled out a separate stock listing for this operation at some point. The increase in Dudley's pay during 2013 was accentuated by a relatively lower level for him during 2012 when the company's difficulties were deemed that much more profound. The \u00a35.2m figure compares with his head of downstream operations, Iain Conn who received \u00a33.4m, up from \u00a31.8m in 2012, while finance director Brian Gilvery received \u00a32.1m last year compared to \u00a31.4m in 2012.",

I can scarcely imagine \u2013 and indeed do not want to imagine \u2013 what turmoil would have occurred in Greece and throughout the European Union if the Europeans hadn\u2019t helped. But what I do imagine is that a reform- minded Greece will also experience European solidarity if the recovery process takes longer than anticipated. </p> </blockquote> <p><b>2) Gauck also hailed those Greek who, despite the long recession, are trying to rebuild its economy together:</b></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I am thinking, for example, of the young Greek entrepreneur abroad who is investing a share of his profits in his home country right now \u2013 for Greece. I am thinking of the civil servant in his late fifties who starts afresh in his attitude and says, \u201cI want to help end corruption and build up effective administration \u2013 for Greece.\u201d I am thinking of the trade unionist who does not push the limits of her powers of obstruction, but rather opens up to compromises \u2013 for Greece. And I am thinking of all the citizens who have enough troubles of their own, but still ask their mayor what their town can do \u2013 for Greece. </p> <p>I appreciate all of these people profoundly. The strength to fuel a new start is something that arises from the heart of a society. Greece needs a strong sense of community, now perhaps more than ever. The social cohesion that I have in mind for the future of civil society can best be compared with a Greek family: lively, helpful, committed to cooperating well with one another. Many other countries envy you this family tradition. My wish for you is for these positive models to become applicable to a larger societal framework, for Greek people actively to contribute their own values and ideas to their community. This will give rise to a new relationship to the state and to its institutions and representatives. </p> </blockquote> <p><b><a href=\"http://www.ekathimerini.com/4dcgi/_w_articles_wsite1_1_06/03/2014_537930\">Tomorrow, Gauck is expected to visit the site of a World War 2 massacre, where German army troops killed 92 villagers near the northeastern town of Ioannina</a></b>.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5318b9d4e4b0024131c0b69e\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2014-03-06T18:09:29.882Z\">6.09pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/faisalislam/statuses/441635186988838912\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>Greek cenbank publish Blackrock report on Greek banks needing \u20ac6bn new capital..

Gauck, who is the third top-ranking German official to visit Athens after Angela Merkel the chancellor and Wolfgang Schauble, the finance minister, in the last 18 months has been telling anyone who will listen that as a teenager growing up in East Germany he learned ancient Greek. </p> <p>The good and the great now gathered at the New Acropolis Museum (as I write cars have been drawing up beneath the Holy Rock with dignitaries) will, insiders say, hear more of the same when Gauck delivers his hotly anticipated speech. </p> <p>Almost nothing about this visit resembles the hostility seen when Merkel and Schauble also passed through Athens. Although the closest contact the German president will have with ordinary Greeks will be at the cocktail reception that will follow his speech tonight, no contact (with the exception of interaction with the press) was permitted during either Merkel\u2019s or Schauble\u2019s visit.

By contrast, household spending edged up by just 0.1%, leaving the consumer revival required to broaden and strengthen the economic recovery still conspicuous by its absence. Admittedly, January\u2019s retail sales numbers (also released Wednesday) recorded a decent monthly gain of 1.6%. But that followed a drop of almost the same size in December, so it is too early to talk about an upward trend. Indeed, retail sales rose by just 0.1% in the three months to January together.</p> <p>Therefore, the latest batch of data on the euro-zone provided rather mixed signals for the European Central Bank ahead of its Governing Council meeting But while not certain, we think that some form of action \u2013 probably in the form of a further cut in interest rates \u2013 is a strong possibility.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/bbcbaxter/statuses/441479076470337536\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>Sarah Hewin of Standard Chartered Bank tells me she doesn&#39;t expect the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%23ECB&amp;src=hash\">#ECB</a> to cut interest rates at its monthly meeting today <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BBCWorldBiz\">@BBCWorldBiz</a></p>&mdash; Alice Baxter (@bbcbaxter) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/bbcbaxter/statuses/441479076470337536\">March 6, 2014</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <h2><strong>Ian Williams of Peel Hunt</strong></h2> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Although [February\u2019s PMI surveys ] are consistent with Q1 <strong>GDP growth</strong> of up to +0.5% QoQ across the region, the employment picture is sluggish and price pressures subdued.

      "bodyText": "That\u2019s all, folks, on a day in which the European Central Bank disappointed those who hoped for new measures to stimulate the global economy. Draghi\u2019s comments on the Russian economy and Ukraine grabbed the headlines,but the ECB\u2019s refusal to ease monetary policy in the face of low inflation is more important in the long run. The new ECB forecasts are pretty clear -- growth will only pick up slowly over the next three years, while inflation will still not hit 2% until 2017. Yet this cocktail of lacklustre expansion, deflationary jitters, and a still-misfiring eurozone bank sector wasn\u2019t enough to prompt fresh action. Draghi\u2019s claim that the eurozone is an island of stability has attracted some ridicule too. As Jeremy Warner writes in the Telegraph: Set against what\u2019s going on in Ukraine, which to be fair is the context in which he was talking, this may be true, but even so, it\u2019s a bit of a stretch given the financial and economic mayhem of the last three years to think the single currency such a defense against the elements. If this is what stability looks like, I hate to think what constitutes a crisis. Hard to argue. Our summary of the press conference is here. Analyst reaction starts here (with several economists unhappy that the ECB didn\u2019t do more) And details of the German President\u2019s visit to Athens start here. Goodnight! GW The German president\u2019s speech in Greece (see 5.47pm) is now online HERE (pdf). Two sections stand out. 1) Joachim Gauck told his audience in Athens that he believes Europe should stand alongside Greece if it needs further support (as long as the Greeks stick to their promises): It has now become virtually a dictum that solidarity and solidity belong together like two sides of the same coin \u2013 a euro coin, let\u2019s say, befitting the theme at hand. Despite all the difficulties we have experienced in recent years, I am thankful for the important progress that has been made in stabilising our common currency. I can scarcely imagine \u2013 and indeed do not want to imagine \u2013 what turmoil would have occurred in Greece and throughout the European Union if the Europeans hadn\u2019t helped. But what I do imagine is that a reform- minded Greece will also experience European solidarity if the recovery process takes longer than anticipated. 2) Gauck also hailed those Greek who, despite the long recession, are trying to rebuild its economy together: I am thinking, for example, of the young Greek entrepreneur abroad who is investing a share of his profits in his home country right now \u2013 for Greece. I am thinking of the civil servant in his late fifties who starts afresh in his attitude and says, \u201cI want to help end corruption and build up effective administration \u2013 for Greece.\u201d I am thinking of the trade unionist who does not push the limits of her powers of obstruction, but rather opens up to compromises \u2013 for Greece. And I am thinking of all the citizens who have enough troubles of their own, but still ask their mayor what their town can do \u2013 for Greece. I appreciate all of these people profoundly. The strength to fuel a new start is something that arises from the heart of a society. Greece needs a strong sense of community, now perhaps more than ever. The social cohesion that I have in mind for the future of civil society can best be compared with a Greek family: lively, helpful, committed to cooperating well with one another. Many other countries envy you this family tradition. My wish for you is for these positive models to become applicable to a larger societal framework, for Greek people actively to contribute their own values and ideas to their community. This will give rise to a new relationship to the state and to its institutions and representatives. Tomorrow, Gauck is expected to visit the site of a World War 2 massacre, where German army troops killed 92 villagers near the northeastern town of Ioannina. And back to Greece where visiting German president will deliver a speech tonight snappily entitled \u201cEurope: Our common heritage and future\u201d. Our correspondent Helena Smith reports from Athens: In keeping with much of his visit so far, Germany\u2019s president Joachim Gauck has decided to emphasise what unites Europe rather than divides Europe in the country that on the ground at least remains more at odds with his own than any other in the 28-nation bloc. Gauck, who is the third top-ranking German official to visit Athens after Angela Merkel the chancellor and Wolfgang Schauble, the finance minister, in the last 18 months has been telling anyone who will listen that as a teenager growing up in East Germany he learned ancient Greek. The good and the great now gathered at the New Acropolis Museum (as I write cars have been drawing up beneath the Holy Rock with dignitaries) will, insiders say, hear more of the same when Gauck delivers his hotly anticipated speech. Almost nothing about this visit resembles the hostility seen when Merkel and Schauble also passed through Athens. Although the closest contact the German president will have with ordinary Greeks will be at the cocktail reception that will follow his speech tonight, no contact (with the exception of interaction with the press) was permitted during either Merkel\u2019s or Schauble\u2019s visit. Likewise, the ban on protests and demonstrations (imposed allegedly in the interests of preserving \u201cpublic safety and non-disruption of socioeconomic life\u201d) has been nothing like the widespread shutdown of the city back in July when Schauble visited for all of eight hours. True, riot police lobbed abundant teargas at members of the communist Pame union protesting austerity (photos here) as they tried to get to the finance ministry earlier today but police are insisting that the demonstrations were not related to Gauck\u2019s visit \u2013 but the presence of mission heads representing the debt-stricken country\u2019s troika of creditors who are also in town. By contrast, thousands took to the streets (who can forget those dressed in Nazi paraphernalia?) in an embarrassing display of anti-German sentiment when Merkel visited Athens in October 2012. \u201cIt\u2019s a reflection of the mood at large and the turn around of our economy,\u201d said one optimistic finance ministry official. Many, of course, would beg to differ - arguing that there is a disconnect between fiscal rectitude (and the incontestable progress Greece has made both reducing its deficit while consolidating its budget) and the miserable lot of the populace at large. But the German president\u2019s visit may also prove that one of the ugliest side effects of Europe\u2019s debt crisis \u2013 the enmity created between Germany and Greece \u2013 has finally withered with the passage of time. Important developments over Ukraine in the last few minutes, which underline Mario Draghi\u2019s comments about how Russian economic growth will be severely hit by the Ukraine crisis. EU leaders have agreed a three-stage set of sanctions to be imposed on Russia, following meetings in Brussels today. Amid a flurry of press briefings, UK PM David Cameron warned that \u2018there can be no business as usual\u2019 with Russia following its military moves in Crimea. He explained that Phase one starts now, with negotiations over a fast-track VISA scheme for Russians being shelved. If meaningful talks to end the crisis don\u2019t begin soon then the EU would move to Phase Two, asset freezes and travel bans. And if Russia escalates the situation further, then a broad range of measures that could have a serious, wide-ranging economic impact would be deployed, Cameron said. German chancellor Angela Merkel also addressed the press - Open Europe has the details: And so was Melissa Eddy of the New York Times: It\u2019s been another dramatic day in Ukraine, with the Crimea parliament voting to join Russia. Our Ukraine liveblog has more details. Sticking with Greece, a health check-up of the country\u2019s major banks has shown they need \u20ac6.4bn of additional capital to withstand potential losses in the future, according to Reuters. Here\u2019s the details: The stress test by Blackrock was run in December to assess whether last year\u2019s \u20ac28bn recapitalisation of Greece\u2019s four biggest banks left them capable of absorbing new shocks as bad loans keep rising in the crisis-hit country. The Bank of Greece will release the results later on Thursday. The results of the stress test have been delayed for months as Greece squabbled with its EU/IMF lenders over how much its banks really need. Back to Greece, and the German president Joachim Gauck has laid a wreath at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier in Athens\u2019 Syntagma Square, on the first day of his visit (see 10.59am for more details). Gauck then headed to the Acropolis Museum in Athens to give a speech - we\u2019ll have details on that shortly.... Over on Wall Street, the S&amp;P 500 index has hit yet another record high, touching 1881 points for the first time ever. The Dow is up too, gaining around 0.5%, as traders prepare for the excitement of tomorrow\u2019s US jobs data (the Non-Farm Payroll for February). Earlier this afternoon, the jobless claims survey showed that 26,000 fewer people signed on for unemployment benefit last week - better than expected. That took the initial claims figure down to 323,000, a three-month low. Howard Archer of IHS Global Insight says Draghi gave \u201cno real sense\u201d that the ECB was keen to take new measures today -- which explains why the euro has hit its highest level of 2014. Even the ECB\u2019s staff\u2019s new Eurozone GDP growth and consumer price inflation forecasts \u2013 which were extended out to 2016 \u2013 contained no smoking gun that points strongly to a future further loosening of monetary policy. Marc Ostwald of Monument Securities dubs the whole ECB press conference an \u2018anti-climax\u2019: As anticipated, the ECB were again \u201call talk and no action\u2019, and while the willingness to act was again stressed, there was a certain sense that Draghi and the ECB council feel rather less pressure \u201cto act\u201d than was the case at the turn of the year. He doesn\u2019t see many gems in the new economic forecasts, either: The new staff forecasts were little more than a marginal tweak to forecasts for 2014, adjusting the GDP projection to 1.2% y/y from 1.1%, and the HICP forecast to 1.0% from 1.1%, which one might term a \u201czero sum\u201d adjustment. The new forecasts for 2016 (GDP 1.8% and CPI 1.5%) underscore both the pledge to keep rates accommodative, and a sense that with the ECB expecting a gradual improvement, there is no need for them to act on the basis of current projections. Francesco Papadia, who used to run the ECB\u2019s open market operations, wasn\u2019t impressed by Draghi\u2019s performance: \u2022 Mario Draghi has warned that Russia\u2019s economy will take a serious growth hit from the ongoing crisis in Ukraine. The ECB president told reporters that: \u201cThe growth impact on the Russian economy is severe. However, it\u2019s very, very difficult to foresee what is going to be the impact over a horizon of two, three years ... if the crisis were to continue. For example, the impact on the energy market, what could this be for Europe. If we look at the next six months, the answer is going to be very mild. If we look in a year and a half, it could be very serious. But it depends on so many things ... and we frankly, we poor central bankers, don\u2019t have enough information to give a reliable assessment of the likely economic impact at such an early stage in the crisis.\u201d \u2022 Draghi suggested that the eurozone shouldn\u2019t suffer a large hit from Ukraine\u2019s problems, as goods, services, and financial services trading is limited. But he then cautioned: \u201cThis would be a limited way to look at the situation because the geopolitical risks in the area could quickly become substantial and generate developments that are unforeseeable and potentially of great consequence.\u201d \u2022 Draghi defended the ECB\u2019s decision not to cut interest rates today, saying financial conditions and the inflation outlook did not support such a move. The ECB also disappointed analysts who had hoped for unconventional measures today, such as an injection of new liquidity into the eurozone system. Draghi said simply that the governing council had held a: broad discussion on changes in interest rates, as well as other monetary policy instruments.\u201d The ECB chief also revealed that the governing council discussed the size of the eurozone\u2019s output gap, suggesting that the slack in the economy would only be eliminated slowly. \u2022 He also insisted that the eurozone was not sinking into a Japanese-style deflation trap, saying the public have confidence that inflation will rise, and that the ECB will act if needed. \u2022 The euro has hit its highest level of 2014, up a cent against the US dollar at $1.3835. \u2022 The ECB also released new forecasts, which showed inflation will only have returned to 1.7% by the end of 2016. It also raised its growth projections a little. The press conference concluded with Draghi defending the stress tests of the eurozone banking sector. So-called \u201czombie banks\u201d don\u2019t conduct useful lending anyway, Draghi says, so need to be identified and purged from the system (I\u2019m paraphrasing). And he claimed that the ECB isn\u2019t worried that the German Constitutional Court has asked European judges to rule on the legality of the ECB\u2019s Outright Monetary Transaction (OMT) scheme -- the pledge to buy unlimited amounts of eurozone debt from countries who struggle to fund themselves. Mario Draghi, European Central Bank president, has warned that the Ukraine crisis is likely to have a serious impact on Russian economic growth - but it\u2019s not yet clear how much it will hurt Europe. Asked about the crisis, Draghi says the ECB did not discussed potential scenarios from the ongoing crisis over Crimea at today\u2019s meeting (in which it left interest rates unchanged) Draghi tells reporters that the ECB has seen a major impact on the Russian and Ukraine economy, and some impact on countries which border them. He then warns that Russia\u2019s economy will take a major hit. The growth impact on the Russian economy is severe.... but it is very, very difficult to see what is going to be the impact over two or three years. The short-term impact on energy prices, for example, is small - but it could be very significant in two years, depending how events play out. \u201cWe poor central bankers\u201d cannot predict how events will play out, he concludes. Reuters has just published Draghi\u2019s earlier comments (2.21pm), in which he warned that geopolitical risks could flare up and create developments of \u201cgreat consequence\u201d, although the eurozone has not been hurt yet. \u201cIf we look (at the situation in Ukraine) from a purely technocratic viewpoint and we look at the amount of trade in goods, services, and financial services and ... capital flows, we have to say that the interconnections are not as important as to suggest a strong contagion from that region,\u201d Draghi told a news conference. \u201cHowever, let me also add that this would be a limited way to look at the situation because the geopolitical risks in the area could quickly become substantial and generate developments that are unforeseeable and potentially of great consequence.\u201d Interesting stat from Draghi: every 10% rise in the eurozone knocks between 40 and 50 basis points (0.4% to 0.5%) off the inflation rate. Draghi\u2019s opening statement is online here. The euro has hit its highest level of 2014, now up 0.86 of a cent at $1.3815. Draghi is also asked the impact that the Ukraine crisis had on today\u2019s decisions. The ECB president replies that he does not see a major threat to the eurozone economy from the events in Ukraine so far. But there is a risk that the geopolitical situation could escalate, creating risks that are \u201cpotentially of great consequence\u201d. Bloomberg\u2019s reporter asks for more details -- reminding Draghi that the Polish central bank chief has spoken about how joining the eurozone would provide protection. Draghi replies that the eurozone is an \u2018island of stability\u2019 -- it needs to become an island of growth and jobs creation too. He declines to comment further on the Ukraine situation, saying such events are beyond the remit of \u201ca humble central banker\u201d. Draghi is asked about \u2018spillover effects\u2019 from turbulence in the emerging markets. He says that domestic governments and central banks are taking actions, and that the best defence for the eurozone is \u201cgood financial policies\u201d. Thirdly, the International Monetary Fund could take action to support emerging economies if needed. Carsten Brzeski agrees that the ECB is refocusing its monetary policy on the eurozone output gap: Were today\u2019s decisions unanimous, and what did the ECB discuss? Draghi says it was a broad discussion about rates and policy instruments. Importantly, he says there was plenty of discussion on the \u2018output gap\u2019 in the eurozone. Assessments of the size of this \u2018slack\u2019 varies, but that gap is only expected to close \u201cvery slowly\u201d, he says. And the ECB will keep its monetary policy stance even after it sees improvements. There was broad consensus, if not unanimity, he says. (last month, the Bank of England rewrote its own forward guidance with a new focus on the output gap) A Japanese journalist (apologies, I missed her name) gets the second question -- asking why the ECB didn\u2019t end the sterilisation of its bond-buying programme (to boost liquidity); and seeking details of why Draghi thinks the eurozone can avoid a Japanese-style deflation trap. Draghi replies that ending such sterilisation is certainly a tool at the ECB\u2019s disposal, but the governing council did not see the \u201cunwarranted tightening\u201d that would justify it. Also, it would have a limited impact, lasting \u201cless than a year\u201d (analysts say it would put \u20ac175bn of new liquidity into the system). And on Japan - Draghi says that inflation expectations remain well-anchored in the eurozone, unlike in Japan 20 years ago. He says people expect the ECB to take action when needed (joking that reporters turn up in Frankfurt each month expecting policy changes, and are disappointed when it doesn\u2019t). And he pins some of the blame for Europe\u2019s low inflation on global factors such as falling energy prices, and the fact that prices are falling in the \u2018programme\u2019 countries where tough austerity is being imposed. Onto questions.... Brian Blackstone of the Wall Street Journal takes the microphone... ...and asks Draghi why the ECB has done nothing today, after saying a month ago that today\u2019s economic forecasts would give the central bank the information it needed to take action: Draghi replies that the new forecasts reaffirm the ECB\u2019s view that a moderate recovery is underway. He points to recent data showing a recovery in the service sector - important, as it is the major source of job creation. The gap between consumer confidence between the periphery and the core of the eurozone has narrowed, he says. And the jobless rate remained flat (with a \u201cstriking\u201d fall in Portugal). We asked ourselves whether the contingencies that I hinted at last month, such as an unwarranted tightening of financial conditions, or a worsening of the inflation outlook, had happened - and they had not, Draghi explains. Draghi ends his statement with the usual warning that governments must continue decisive economic reforms, making it \u2018easier to do business, and boost employment\u2019 in the region. Draghi is giving some details about the ECB\u2019s new economic forecasts. The central bank now expects slightly faster growth this year, picking up pace in 2015 and 2016. The inflation forecasts are interesting too -- the ECB does not see it hitting the target of \u201cclose to, but below 2%\u201d in 2016 (update: the forecasts have inflation at 1.7% at the end of 2016) On the jobs crisis, Draghi says that unemployment in the euro area is \u201cstabilising\u201d but remains high (it was flat at 12% in January). The euro is rising, up half a cent against the US dollar to \u20ac1.37, as Draghi fails to announce any new measures - not even an end to sterilising its bond-buying programme (yet, anyway) Draghi also points to spare capacity in the euro area: Draghi reiterates the ECB\u2019s \u2018forward guidance\u2019 - that interest rates will remain at their present levels, or lower for an extended period. Inflation expectations in the medium and long term, continue to be firmly anchored. he says. Draghi adds that the ECB remains determined to maintain the high degree of accommodative monetary policy for as long as needed, and will take further actions as it sees fit. And we\u2019re off. Mario Draghi confirms that the ECB has left the key interest rates unchanged, with the latest data showing that \u201cthe moderate economic recovery in the eurozone is proceeding.\u201d But the ECB\u2019s latest economic forecasts confirm that the eurozone faces a prolonged period of low inflation. The press pack are assembled at the ECB... now we just need Mario Draghi. You can watch Mario Draghi\u2019s press conference live on the ECB\u2019s web site - here. Credit Agricole\u2019s Frederik Ducrozet says there are five things to watch out from Mario Draghi - including the ECB\u2019s new economic forecasts, and whether today\u2019s decisions were unanimous: RBS economist Richard Barwell reckons Mario Draghi will tell reporters this afternoon that the eurozone economy is healing, and that the ECB certainly would act if needed. He told Reuters: \u201dThere will be two messages: firstly, things are eventually going to get better and therefore we don\u2019t need to act today. Secondly, if things get any worse in the near future, we absolutely will act.\u201d Mario Draghi\u2019s press conference, which begins at 1.30pm GMT (2.30 CET), will give the ECB chief the opportunity to announce any new measures -- or perhaps hint at future plans. As explained in our opening post, the European Central Bank could boost liquidity in the euro area, by ending a process which \u2018soaks up\u2019 money spent on eurozone bonds at the height of the crisis (Reuters has a good explainer here). HERE WE GO. The European Central Bank has voted to leave its main interest rate unchanged, at 0.25%. There\u2019s a brief statement here. The deposit facility, which banks receive on overnight deposits with the Eurosystem, remains at 0.0%. The marginal lending facility, which banks pay to borrow overnight, remains at 0.75%. So, no reaction from the ECB to the low inflation rate in the eurozone (just 0.8%), or the weak growth rates in many members of the currency region. Next up, Mario Draghi\u2019s press conference in just under 45 minutes time, and the ECB\u2019s new economic forecasts. Nearly time for the ECB\u2019s decision. A majority of City economists reckon it will also leave interest rates unchanged, but a few reckon we could see a cut.... David Kern, chief economist at the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC), hopes the Bank of England will continues to leave interest rates alone for some time: Kern argues the \u201ccontinued clamour for early rate rises\u201d is unwelcome and undermines the benefits of the Bank\u2019s forward guidance (that borrowing costs won\u2019t rise until the UK economy is stronger): Even though we are getting closer to pre-recession GDP levels, this does not mean that the economy is back to normal. \u201cAt a time when inflation is below target and is expected to remain stable, the recent strength of sterling will help to dampen any new inflationary pressures, and should reinforce the case against interest rate increases. Maintaining low rates underpins economic stability, enabling businesses to proceed with much needed investment \u2013 in the interests of growth and jobs.\u201d Today\u2019s decision means UK interest rates have been pegged at just 0.5% for every month since March 2009. NO CHANGE. The Bank of England has voted to leave UK interest rates unchanged at their record low of 0.5%, and also left its quantitative easing programme untouched at \u00a3375bn. Five minutes until the Bank of England\u2019s decision on UK interest rates. There\u2019s little tension in the City, though, given the Bank\u2019s \u2018forward guidance\u2019 that rates won\u2019t be lifted until the economy is stronger. Sony Kapoor, of the ReDefine thinktank, isn\u2019t optimistic that the ECB will announce new measures today: A couple of photos from today\u2019s clashes (see also 10.59am) between anti-austerity demonstrators and riot police in Athens, after protests were banned during the German president\u2019s visit. The demonstration was organised by the communist PAME union. AP reports that riot police used tear gas and pepper spray after \u201cseveral dozen demonstrators\u201d tried to break through a police cordon preventing them marching to the Finance Ministry. Germany\u2019s manufacturing sector made a good start to 2013 -- industrial orders jumped 1.2% in January, beating forecasts, according to a new survey from the German Economy Ministry. It was driven by a 1.6% jump in domestic business, while new orders from overseas rose by 1.0% Carsten Brzeski, ING economist, says the short-term outlook for the German economy had picked up -- but the Ukraine crisis shows the importance of creating more domestic demand. He writes: Taken one-by-one, slowing emerging markets, Russia or the Ukraine are too small to matter for the economy. However, together with China, all these countries together account for around 15% of all German exports. It looks as if the basis for a strong pick-up in German exports is shrinking. All in all, today\u2019s data send two important messages for the German growth outlook. The near term looks very rosy and industrial production should gain further momentum. To maintain this momentum into the longer term, however, the economy needs more domestic demand. Riot police and anti-austerity protesters have scuffled in Athens, as German president Joachim Gauck begins a visit to Greece. Gauck, who inspected a guard of honour this morning, is expected to visit a second world war memorial site tomorrow. Athens authorities had imposed a ban on protests in parts of Athens today - which was defied by some demonstrators. AP has the story: Riot police have used tear gas and pepper spray during scuffles with union members protesting austerity measures, during a ban on demonstrations in parts of central Athens due to a visit by German President Joachim Gauck. Scuffles broke out Thursday when a group of several dozen demonstrators attempted to break through a police cordon on a major avenue in an effort to march to the Finance Ministry. The demonstrations were unrelated to the visit by Gauck, who was meeting with his Greek counterpart and was due to visit the site of a Nazi massacre in central Greece Friday. Authorities banned all demonstrations from 8 a.m. to 7p.m. local time in parts of the city, citing security concerns. Several hundred union members, mainly construction workers, had already scheduled demonstrations. These tweets (more here) appear to show the clashes: Greek newspaper Kathimerini reports that Gauck refused to discuss demands in Greece that Germany should pay reparations for World War II atrocities. But he said Germany bears an undeniable \u201cmoral burden.\u201d Germany says it has settled all World War II reparations issues, and the Greek government has been reluctant to aggressively pursue the matter. But opposition politicians have seized on Gauck\u2019s visit to call for action. German president seeks to visit Nazi massacre site Greece\u2019s unemployment rate has dropped slightly in December to 27.5%, down from 27.6% in January, but more than double the average for the euro area. The small decline was due to more people dropping out of the labour market altogether. The ELSTAT statistics body reported that the number of people actually in work fell by 5,418 in December , while the number counted as unemployed dropped by 10,864. The total classed as \u2018inactive\u2019 (rather than unemployed) rose by 4,453. The survey also showed that women are worst hit by the Greek jobless crisis -- with almost a third unemployed, compared to a quarter of men. And there was a small annual drop in the youth jobless rate - to 55.5% from 57.1% a year ago. On an annual basis, almost 100,000 people lost their jobs during 2013, the sixth year of Greece\u2019s recession, while the unemployment total rose by almost 50,000 and the inactive total rose by 47,000. There are now: 3,555,034 people employed in Greece 1,349,495 people unemployed 3,388,917 people inactive. Compare and contrast.... Just in: staff at the John Lewis Partnership are getting bonuses worth almost eight week\u2019s pay -- slightly less than a year ago. The group, famously owned by its workers, reported that employees will share a \u00a3202.5m bonus pot for 2013. That\u2019s worth around 15% of salary to its 91,000 partners. Gross sales broke through the \u00a310bn figure, up 6%, with solid growth at its Waitrose supermarket outlets and John Lewis department stores. The John Lewis bonus pot is announced to staff across the organisation at the same moment each year. Pre-tax profits before exceptional items rose almost 9% to \u00a3376.4m, but was down 4% at \u00a3329m once the \u00a340m cost of compensating staff who were underpaid over holiday pay for several years. This year\u2019s payment was also hit by the cost of servicing its pension deficit (which is now over \u00a31bn). Full details here. Chairman Charlie Mayfield said the outlook looks quite bright: There are more encouraging signs for the economy as a whole and, although this has not yet come through as a significant increase in consumer spending, I am cautiously optimistic that we will see improvements this year. I am confident that however quickly the UK economy emerges from this prolonged period of slow growth, the Partnership is well positioned to continue to strengthen its competitive position and to grow market share in both Waitrose and John Lewis. While Britain\u2019s house prices are accelerating, car sales are slowing down. The SMMT reports that registrations of new vehicles rose by 3% in February, rather lower than the 7.6% seen in January. New car sales had jumped by over 10% last year, as the British car market outperformed the eurozone. Today\u2019s Halifax house price survey also shows that affordability is falling towards levels seen in the late \u201880s, as Sky\u2019s Ed Conway flags up: POP. The Milan stock market just hit its highest level since June 2011. The Italian FTSE MIB jumped 211 points to 20970, a 1% gain. European investors remained calm as they await the European Central Bank\u2019s meeting, and its new economic forecasts. The Ukraine crisis appears to have drifted off the City\u2019s radar. In London, the FTSE 100 has gained 27 points to 6802, up 0.4%, with Aviva leading the way after this morning\u2019s decent results. Germany\u2019s DAX is up 0.4%, and the French CAC has gained 0.6%. In the currency markets, the euro is flat against the US dollar at $1.372 In the stock market, Aviva\u2019s share price has surged 8% after reporting a 6% jump in operating profits. CEO Mark Wilson says insurance firm\u2019s turnaround plan is working, a year after a shareholder rebellion forced his predecessor out. But construction firm Balfour Beatty have slid almost 6% after hitting investors with a 32% drop in profits, which it admitted was \u201cdisappointing\u201d. It blamed \u201cchallenging economic conditions and operational issues in UK construction\u201d, and a downturn in the Australian mining sector Kit Juckes of Societe Generale (and Simon &amp; Garfunkel fan) reckons that the European Central Bank will do little today, writing: What the ECB is likely to offer us today is a pocketful of mumbles (promises, all lies and jests). And we, of course, will hear what we want to hear and disregard the rest. The most likely move, Kit says, is ending the \u2018sterilisation\u2019 of the sovereign bonds bought by the ECB a few years ago. That would increase euro-ares liquidity by around \u20ac175bn (see opening post): That doesn\u2019t strike me as a game-changer.... I can\u2019t really see what the ECB can do from here to boost credit demand and therefore money supply either. Britain\u2019s housing boom surged again in February, with prices rising at their fastest rate in almost five years. That\u2019s according to the latest survey from the Halifax building society. It reports that prices rose 2.4% last month, which is the biggest monthly rise since May 2009. The average home is now worth \u00a3179,872. Economists had expected a rise of just 0.7%, and this leap reinforces fears that a bubble may be forming in the housing market (although most of the concern still centres on London). House prices in the three months to January were 7.9% higher than a year earlier. Stephen Noakes, mortgages director at Halifax, reckons the price rises will slow later this year -- pointing to the recent revival in housebuilding. \u201dSeveral factors appear to have boosted demand, such as the improved economic outlook, unemployment falling faster than expected, improvements in consumer confidence and low interest rates. However, continuing pressures on household finances, as earnings fail to keep pace with consumer price inflation, are expected to remain a constraint on the rate of growth of house prices. Halifax added that the average house is still worth 10% than the pre-crisis peak in August 2007. Howard Archer of IHS Global Insight said the data shows the Bank of England was wise to end its support for mortgage lending at the end of 2013: While the strength of house prices is not yet a serious concern outside of London, it is something that needs to be closely monitored given that a number of recent data and surveys have indicated that the strength in house prices is becoming more widespread. There is rising buyer interest and strengthening market activity across regions. For more detail on the ECB decision, check out this breakdown of the latest eurozone data on the WSJ. Economists and analysts are quite divided about what the European Central Bank will do at today\u2019s meeting. Some argue the fragility of the eurozone recovery means the ECB will cut interest rates to fresh record lows. Others point to January\u2019s stable inflation reading, which calmed fears that the region is sinking into deflation. Berenberg Bank economist Christian Schulz: It is a close call this time. The ECB itself had considerably raised the odds of additional easing action by highlighting, in its last statement, the new inflation forecasts that it will publish at the March meeting. But mostly positive data releases since February have weakened the case for action. On balance, the data received since the last meeting do not warrant downward revisions of the inflation forecasts. The eurozone recovery is proving resilient to the emerging market troubles. Jonathan Loynes of Capital Economics: The second estimate of Q4 Euro-zone GDP (released on Wednesday) confirmed that the economy posted a pretty modest quarterly expansion of 0.3% and that growth was driven by exports (+1.2% q/q) and investment (+1.1%). By contrast, household spending edged up by just 0.1%, leaving the consumer revival required to broaden and strengthen the economic recovery still conspicuous by its absence. Admittedly, January\u2019s retail sales numbers (also released Wednesday) recorded a decent monthly gain of 1.6%. But that followed a drop of almost the same size in December, so it is too early to talk about an upward trend. Indeed, retail sales rose by just 0.1% in the three months to January together. Therefore, the latest batch of data on the euro-zone provided rather mixed signals for the European Central Bank ahead of its Governing Council meeting But while not certain, we think that some form of action \u2013 probably in the form of a further cut in interest rates \u2013 is a strong possibility. Ian Williams of Peel Hunt Although [February\u2019s PMI surveys ] are consistent with Q1 GDP growth of up to +0.5% QoQ across the region, the employment picture is sluggish and price pressures subdued. There is still a case for more policy action after today\u2019s ECB meeting. Stan Shamu of IG: Perhaps the main issues to look for would be a cut to the refinancing rate from 25 basis points to say 10 basis points. The idea here is to limit the upside in EONIA (interbank lending rates) rates. There is also a lot of talk about not sterilising the bonds it purchased through its Securities Market Program (SMP) during 2012. This would cap gains in the EUR as it could see its balance sheet expand by around 6%. There will also be focus on revisions to the ECB\u2019s economic projections. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the financial markets, the world economy, the eurozone and business. It\u2019s Central Bank Thursday -- with the European Central Bank and the Bank of England both holding their monthly monetary policy meetings today. Analysts are split over whether the ECB will take new action to stimulate the eurozone economy, with some hoping that its president, Mario Draghi, hasn\u2019t given up being decisive for Lent. As Frederik Ducrozet of Credit Agricole puts it: The ECB has several tools at its disposal if it decides to do more to promote growth and drive inflation up. It could cut the headline interest rate in the eurozone, which is already at a record low of 0.25%. Another option is to stop \u2018sterilising\u2019 the eurozone bonds it bought to calm the crisis in 2011 and 2012. That would pump more liquidity into the euro financial sector. The ECB could announce a scheme to drive credit to small firms -- similar to the UK\u2019s \u2018funding for lending\u2019 scheme\u2019. There\u2019s even the possibility of imposing negative interest rates on eurozone banks to force them to lend more. Importantly, the ECB has new economic forecasts to work with, showing how its economists expect growth and inflation to pan out through to 2016. Those forecasts could give it the impetus for action. Although, with the inflation rate stable at 0.8% last month, and the Ukraine crisis looming over the economy, the ECB may decide to sit on its hands for another month The ECB releases its decision at 12.45pm GMT, followed by a press conference at 1.30pm GMT. We\u2019re not expecting any fireworks from the Bank of England, as we enter the sixth year of record low interest rates. The BoE will surely leave borrowing costs at the current record low at noon - although there\u2019s always a (thin) chance of a statement. Yesterday marked the fifth anniversary of UK interest rates at their record low of 0.5%. Also coming up today - two pieces of economic data from the countries which book-end the eurozone economy: \u2022 Greek unemployment survey for December, at 10am GMT \u2022 German factory orders for January, at 11am GMT I\u2019ll be tracking all the key events through the day...",

That sounds like a healthy increase \u2013 until the January figure is taken into account.

      "body": "<p>The lower house has passed a bill to remove Qantas\u2019s foreign ownership restrictions, as the opposition warned of a break-up of the national carrier and ministers argued against governing \u201cby nostalgia and sentiment\u201d.<br></p> <p>But the Abbott government\u2019s proposed legislation still faces likely defeat in the Senate.</p> <p>The deputy prime minister and transport minister, Warren Truss, <a href=\"http://parlinfo.aph.gov.au/parlInfo/download/legislation/bills/r5187_first-reps/toc_pdf/14029b01.pdf;fileType=application%2Fpdf\">presented his bill</a> to \u201cremove the regulatory handcuffs\u201d to the house of representatives on Thursday morning.</p> <p>The bill removes <a href=\"http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Details/C2012C00396/Html/Text#_Toc322686887\">part three of the Qantas Sale Act</a> \u2013 the part that imposes a 49% cap on the total foreign ownership of Qantas. The part to be abolished also caps ownership by a single foreign investor at 25% and ownership by foreign airlines at 35%. It also requires that facilities, including maintenance and catering, used by Qantas in the provision of international services are principally located in Australia.</p> <p>But the government\u2019s bill also amends a separate law \u2013 the Air Navigation Act \u2013 to include Qantas in the definition of an Australian international airline. This means Qantas\u2019s international operations would remain subject to restrictions to access air traffic rights under Australia\u2019s international air service agreements. <a href=\"http://parlinfo.aph.gov.au/parlInfo/download/legislation/ems/r5187_ems_d086b1ad-2429-4329-b53f-9a3183dc05e4/upload_pdf/391939.pdf;fileType=application%2Fpdf\">The explanatory notes say</a> this includes a requirement that \u201cthey are substantially owned and effectively controlled by Australian nationals\u201d.</p> <p>The opposition has predicted that the government\u2019s bill could lead to the break-up of the national carrier into international and domestic arms, the latter of which could be majority foreign owned. The government is pursuing the bill despite the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/mar/04/crossbench-senators-vow-block-deregulate-qantas\">low chance of securing passage through either the current Senate or the new Senate</a>, which sits from July. The bill is opposed by Labor, the Greens, key crossbench senators Nick Xenophon and John Madigan and the soon-to-be-influential Palmer United party.</p> <p>The prime minister, Tony Abbott, said the lower house had \u201ctaken a big step towards liberating Qantas\u201d from the shackles of the Qantas Sale Act.</p> <p>In question time, the opposition asked Abbott whether he accepted Qantas\u2019s enviable safety record was in no small part due to the professionalism, hard work, commitment and expertise of its Australian-based maintenance crews. Abbott said he was grateful to the workers responsible for Qantas\u2019s \u201cfine safety record\u201d but it was reckless to suggest the Qantas Sale Act was responsible.</p> <p>The Labor MP Michael Danby was forced to leave the chamber after he refused to withdraw his interjection which compared the safety of China Southern Airlines with that of Qantas.</p> <p>During the earlier debate, Truss said the bill would allow aviation businesses in Australia to compete on an equal footing.

      "bodyText": "The lower house has passed a bill to remove Qantas\u2019s foreign ownership restrictions, as the opposition warned of a break-up of the national carrier and ministers argued against governing \u201cby nostalgia and sentiment\u201d. But the Abbott government\u2019s proposed legislation still faces likely defeat in the Senate. The deputy prime minister and transport minister, Warren Truss, presented his bill to \u201cremove the regulatory handcuffs\u201d to the house of representatives on Thursday morning. The bill removes part three of the Qantas Sale Act \u2013 the part that imposes a 49% cap on the total foreign ownership of Qantas. The part to be abolished also caps ownership by a single foreign investor at 25% and ownership by foreign airlines at 35%. It also requires that facilities, including maintenance and catering, used by Qantas in the provision of international services are principally located in Australia. But the government\u2019s bill also amends a separate law \u2013 the Air Navigation Act \u2013 to include Qantas in the definition of an Australian international airline. This means Qantas\u2019s international operations would remain subject to restrictions to access air traffic rights under Australia\u2019s international air service agreements. The explanatory notes say this includes a requirement that \u201cthey are substantially owned and effectively controlled by Australian nationals\u201d. The opposition has predicted that the government\u2019s bill could lead to the break-up of the national carrier into international and domestic arms, the latter of which could be majority foreign owned. The government is pursuing the bill despite the low chance of securing passage through either the current Senate or the new Senate, which sits from July. The bill is opposed by Labor, the Greens, key crossbench senators Nick Xenophon and John Madigan and the soon-to-be-influential Palmer United party. The prime minister, Tony Abbott, said the lower house had \u201ctaken a big step towards liberating Qantas\u201d from the shackles of the Qantas Sale Act. In question time, the opposition asked Abbott whether he accepted Qantas\u2019s enviable safety record was in no small part due to the professionalism, hard work, commitment and expertise of its Australian-based maintenance crews. Abbott said he was grateful to the workers responsible for Qantas\u2019s \u201cfine safety record\u201d but it was reckless to suggest the Qantas Sale Act was responsible. The Labor MP Michael Danby was forced to leave the chamber after he refused to withdraw his interjection which compared the safety of China Southern Airlines with that of Qantas. During the earlier debate, Truss said the bill would allow aviation businesses in Australia to compete on an equal footing. It would \u201cremove the regulatory handcuffs\u201d that applied to Qantas but not to its competitors. Truss suggested the regulations held back Qantas and were reminiscent of the last century. The opposition leader, Bill Shorten, said proposed changes to the Qantas Sale Act were a \u201cmirage\u201d because it would take time for the company to attract foreign capital and it did not address the company\u2019s immediate issues. Shorten said the treasurer, Joe Hockey, had recently strongly signalled his support for a debt guarantee for Qantas as part of an \u201cugly, messy process of which the government can take no pride\u201d. \u201cYou know you talk a lot about loving this country,\u201d he told government members. \u201cYou\u2019re very quick to talk about patriotism but when it comes to a tough issue, a subtle issue, an issue which involves steering through, which doesn\u2019t involve you standing at a parade and taking a salute \u2013 this is important \u2013 but when it comes to the tough issues of jobs, you go missing.\u201d The immigration minister, Scott Morrison, said he wanted Qantas to have a strong future but the opposition seemed to want to take Australia back to the pre-privatisation situation by suggesting greater taxpayer involvement in Qantas. \u201cI am a passionate advocate for Qantas but I am a realist as well and I know that a government that is serious cannot govern by nostalgia and sentiment. It cannot govern by emotion,\u201d said Morrison, a former Tourism Australia chief. \u201cWhat Qantas needs is the ability to be able to work with equity partners \u2026 and we can\u2019t keep these potential partners locked behind closed doors as the Qantas Sale Act does.\u201d Labor\u2019s transport spokesman, Anthony Albanese, said his stance against majority foreign ownership of Qantas was based on a \u201ccold, hard analysis of Australia\u2019s economic interest\u201d but also that the flying kangaroo was also \u201ca source of pride\u201d to Australians. \u201cQantas is very different in terms of its corporate structure from Virgin. Virgin have the big owners; the three government-backed airlines and of course Virgin international through Richard Branson. Qantas\u2019s ownership structure is very different,\u201d he said. Albanese said the impact of a Qantas break-up on the national interest should be taken \u201cvery seriously indeed\u201d. The government-dominated House of Representatives divided to vote 10 times in the space of less than four hours, including multiple procedural and gag motions. Normally debate on a bill would be adjourned after being introduced by the relevant minister, unless urgent, but Labor called for an immediate debate. Truss initially rejected the idea but the leader of government business, Christopher Pyne, soon agreed that debate should be allowed. Pyne said the government was \u201cdelighted\u201d to move straight to debate as the lower house could pass the bill by lunchtime, shifting the matter to the Senate where any failure to pass the legislation would be Labor\u2019s fault. After about two-and-a-half hours, Pyne began the process of shutting down debate and moving to a vote. In the final division, MPs voted 83-53 to support the bill. On Thursday the Senate launched a committee inquiry into options for government assistance to Qantas, including a debt guarantee or an equity stake, and the potential impact on jobs of the Coalition\u2019s push to remove ownership restrictions. It is likely to call the Qantas chief executive, Alan Joyce, to give evidence. Joyce last week announced plans to axe 5,000 full-time jobs and introduce wage freezes after posting an underlying before-tax loss of $252m for the last six months of 2013.",
