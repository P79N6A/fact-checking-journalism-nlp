      "bodyText": "The International Monetary Fund has warned that a housing bubble could derail the UK's economic recovery, as it urged the government to consider reining in the Help to Buy scheme and called on the Bank of England to clamp down on risky mortgages. The IMF also ended its row with George Osborne over austerity by describing the chancellor's deficit reduction plan as \"appropriate\" in its annual review of the British economy. Christine Lagarde, the IMF's managing director, admitted that the organisation had underestimated the strength of the UK's economic recovery and predicted that it would continue for the next few years. But in the same week that the European commission expressed concerns over the domestic housing market, Lagarde added to the chorus of concern over the role of property in Britain's economic revival. Presenting the report in London on Friday, she said the UK needed to restrict high loan-to-income mortgages and reconsider the Help to Buy mortgage subsidy programme to prevent families becoming vulnerable to a collapse in house values or a surprise interest rate rise. Responding to the review, the chancellor conceded that Britain must keep a close eye on rising house prices and indebtedness, but welcomed the IMF's overall endorsement. Osborne made clear that he expects the Bank of England to take action, which could include limiting mortgage ratios and recommending changes to Help to Buy, if it sees a housing bubble forming. Osborne said: \"I agree with Christine Lagarde that we need to be alert to the build-up of debt in the housing market. We need to be alert when we see house prices rising. I have given the Bank of England tools to do the job, and they should not hesitate to use those tools if they see these developments turning into a risk to the British economy.\" Lagarde called on the Bank of England to deploy \"macro-prudential\" measures to address the financial risk, including potential caps on loan-to-income and loan-to-value mortgage ratios. Later this month, the Bank's financial policy committee (FPC) will announce whether it is taking action to cool the market in the wake of a warning from deputy governor Sir Jon Cunliffe that it was the brightest of \"blinking warning lights\" of risk. Lagarde said action should be taken \"in a gradual, flexible way\" to see whether the measures worked. \"Clearly it is something that needs to be watched and depending on circumstances, on pricing levels, those macro-prudential measures should be further activated if necessary.\" Published in the same week that the Nationwide building society reported record average house prices, the IMF report said that the property market remained one of the major threats to the recovery, alongside poor productivity growth and the weakness of the banking sector. The withdrawal of low interest rates in the UK and the US could also undermine much of the progress made since the recession should it be mishandled by central banks and treasury policymakers, it said. It said: \"A steady increase in the size of new mortgages compared with borrower incomes suggests that households are gradually becoming more vulnerable to income and interest rate shocks.\" Treasury officials are understood to be confident that restrictions on home loans will cool the market over the coming months without the need for a hike in interest rates. Lagarde said the UK's mix of tax rises and spending cuts was \"appropriate\", but argued that the export sector remained weak and in need of a boost. Osborne said the UK economy was \"firing on all cylinders\", but the coalition needed to \"work through our plan to eliminate the deficit and move this country into surplus\". The IMF has voiced concern in the past over the UK's path out of recession. Last year, its chief economist, Olivier Blanchard, controversially accused Osborne of \"playing with fire\" by maintaining spending cuts as economic growth faltered at the time, with Lagarde's assessment on Friday confirming a full retreat from Blanchard's stance. \"I am happy to come back yet again and say that we had clearly underestimated the growth of the UK economy in our forecast a year ago,\" she said. But the latest report said it expected the recovery to continue beyond next year, though not at the current rate of more than 3%. Lagarde also used Friday's news conference to rule herself out of the race to be president of the European commission, insisting: \"I am not a candidate.\" The possibility of her taking the EU's top job had reportedly been discussed by German chancellor Angela Merkel after David Cameron made clear Britain's opposition to the front-runner, Luxembourg's former prime minister Jean-Claude Juncker.",

    "webTitle": "Fashion's coolest look: Burberry's Bailey gets \u00a315m just for being there", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Angela Ahrendts, former chief executive of Burberry, called her chief creative officer \"one of this generation's greatest visionaries\". We learned this week that Christopher Bailey, now her successor, was also the recipient last summer of one of this generation's greatest retention bonuses \u2013 a cool \u00a315m. The payment was quietly disclosed on page 104 of the fashion house's annual report. Bailey got 1m shares as an \"exceptional\" award last July when Burberry's share price, as now, was about \u00a315. It was his second such \"exceptional\" award; he also got 350,000 shares in December 2010, worth about \u00a34m at the time. Cheap at the price, some Burberry investors may feel, if they have enjoyed the rise in the share price from 400p a decade ago and share Ahrendts's assessment of Bailey's talents. OK, but aren't share-based awards worth many millions meant to be tied explicitly to future success via performance hurdles? In Bailey's case, his exceptional handouts merely required him to stay at Burberry \"over three, four and five years from the date of grant\". Naturally, he also got a performance-related bundle when he succeeded Ahrendts last month. It amounted to 500,000 shares, worth \u00a37.5m at current prices. In total, then, Bailey has had share awards worth \u00a322.5m in the past year. They pay themselves well at the top of the fashion world but, by the standards of a mid-ranking FTSE-100 firm (Burberry is worth \u00a37bn), it's a lot. Bosses of titans such as Vodafone or GlaxoSmithKline would struggle to command awards of that size in such a short period. The other oddity in Bailey's pay package is his \u00a3440,000 annual cash \"allowance\" in addition to his \u00a31.1m salary. As mentioned here a few weeks ago, Burberry refuses to say what this \"allowance\" is for. It does not cover Bailey's clothes, cars or medical insurance \u2013 that much is spelled out. Instead, the pay report says the \u00a3440,000 was \"agreed in his previous role, prior to his appointment as an executive director\". That is not an explanation. \"I hope you find this report clear and comprehensive and I look forward to hearing your feedback,\" writes Ian Carter, head of the pay committee, in his introductory remarks. Since you ask, Mr Carter, the answer is: no, some of this stuff is as clear as mud. Bailey, having arrived on the board after the end of the financial year, is not even included in the standard table listing directors' full interests in shares. Yet the note on page 104 reveals there are \"a number\" of share awards from past years \"in addition\" to the \u00a315m and \u00a34m. Why not just let investors see the full tally? The point is not to gawp at Bailey's rewards, and wonder what else is yet to be disclosed. The real question for Burberry shareholders is whether the board, led by chairman Sir John Peace, has simply made an almighty bet on one man's genius. Bailey is now both chief executive and chief creative officer, the two most important jobs at the company. He has been given \u00a315m worth of freebie shares to encourage him to stay. And he gets a \u00a3440,000 annual allowance because he always has. Normal boardroom pay practices for FTSE-100 firms have been discarded. Standard Chartered, where Peace is also chairman, suffered a 41% rebellion against its pay report last month. One top-10 fund manager said the bank's communication amounted to \"making it up as they went along\". Before they vote on Burberry's report, investors should demand more transparency from Peace. Maybe there is a case for paying an \"unconventional\" chief executive \u2013 Bailey's own description \u2013 in an unconventional manner. But the argument has not been made in this annual report. AA recovery Here's one way to deal with choppy conditions in the flotation market: flog two-thirds of the company to nine institutions beforehand. AA's sale-cum-flotation is either a clever or a desperate tactic by the owners, the private equity firms CVC, Permira and Charterhouse. The clever part is that they have avoided the risk of a flotation flop along the lines of Saga, the other firm that used to be housed under their Acromas banner. By accepting an offer of \u00a3930m for 67% of the AA, they have established a certain value. The (possibly) desperate part lies in the fact that such certainty tends to require a discount. One suspects Aviva, BlackRock, GLG, Lansdowne and the other \"cornerstone\" investing institutions have done their homework. The AA is tricky to value because it is towing \u00a33bn of debt. But it is a highly cash-generative business; it is the biggest operator in a market where size brings clear advantages; and profit margins on the main roadside assistance business were close to 50% at the trading level last year. In other words, the AA's road to paying down that debt is long but visibility is excellent. The implied price tag of \u00a31.38bn for 100% of the equity may turn out to be very good business for buyers who are prepared to commit for the long-term. Bob Mackenzie, formerly of Green Flag and National Car Parks, is leading the new management team that took the deal to the institutions and found \u00a3930m of support. He has shown sharp manoeuvring skills on this deal. If the IMF is worried\u2026 The International Monetary Fund is (or used to be) zealously opposed to almost any form of capital control. So, when it argues for greater restrictions on mortgages to confront the risks of a dangerous housing bubble in London and the south-east, it is probably wise to listen. A few banks are already tightening lending criteria. Lloyds, for example, said last month that it would limit mortgage lending to four times income for loans worth more than \u00a3500,000. But, rather than rely on banks to apply common sense, the Bank of England's financial policy committee should define what it regards as safe lending in a post-frenzy climate. And it should do so at this month's meeting. As for Help to Buy, George Osborne's much-maligned scheme, it is probably not the greatest culprit. The data suggests very few homes in London are being bought with the help of government guarantees. But perceptions matter and Help to Buy may be encouraging the foolish thought among stretched borrowers that London houses are always a one-way bet. As a first step, cut the maximum value of qualifying houses from \u00a3600,000 to \u00a3300,000; then phase out Help to Buy altogether. Free shares won't turn TSB staff into partners It is a shame TSB over-egged its new pay policy by claiming to have \"taken inspiration\" from John Lewis by making its staff \"partners\". The terminology doesn't work. Staff at John Lewis are partners because John Lewis isn employee-owned partnership. TSB after separation from Lloyds, will be owned by shareholders and gifting the staff \u00a3100 of shares does not make them partners. Never mind, the analogy is better for its all-employee annual bonus scheme. Here recipients \u2013 \"from CEO to frontline branch staff\" \u2013 will receive the same percentage of salary as an annual cash bonus. Yes, that is roughly how John Lewis does things. Inevitably, TSB executives, led by chief executive Paul Pester, will enjoy a separate bonus scheme on top, which is not John Lewis-like. But the sums are a step down from normal banking fare (Pester's all-in maximum earnings would be \u00a31.687m) and TSB says bonuses will be tied to levels of customer service, rather than flogging financial products. Details will be crucial, but TSB's approach looks promising.",

      "bodyText": "The American lawyer who orchestrated a successful class action suit against the tobacco industry 20 years ago has turned his sights on the stock exchanges caught up in the controversy over high-frequency trading. HFT is the process by which professional traders are able to put orders in to the stock market more quickly than the majority of investors. Putting in these earlier bets on the market, it is alleged, allows professionals to make quick profits at the expense of savers and investors in pension funds. The practice is being tested in a class action suit filed in a New York court last month by a number of US legal firms including Michael Lewis, the lawyer who led a class action suit brought by the state of Mississippi in 1994. The team of lawyers he assembled at that time led to $368.5bn (\u00a3220bn) being paid out by 13 tobacco companies to cover the cost of treating illnesses related to smoking in almost 40 US states. In an interview in Weekend magazine, Lewis \u2013 who is not related to the author of the same name whose book Flash Boys exposed high-frequency trading to the public \u2013 describes his court action as \"a small skirmish against the larger backdrop of the vast accumulation of wealth and political power\". The case in the Southern District of New York is filed against 13 stock exchanges and subsidiaries on behalf of Harold Lanier \"individually, and on behalf of all others similarly situated\". \"This is a case about broken promises,\" the 40-page document begins. It is signed by eight legal firms. In the interview, Lewis says that the information being provided by exchanges \"was not timely or accurate, and wasn't fairly distributed\", and alleges that they were in breach of contract. \"The illusory market \u2013 the market that the investor sees when he looks at his monitor \u2013 is anywhere from 1,500 to 900 milliseconds old. That doesn't sound like much, because the blink of an eye is 300 milliseconds. But that's a long, long time in the world of HFT.\" The case was filed on 22 May, and is one of what is expected to be a large number of legal cases related to HFT. The 13 exchanges involved are yet to file a formal response in the court. In April, Providence, the capital of the US state of Rhode Island, filed a case targeting a number of exchanges charged with fraud.",

      "bodyText": "The private equity owner of the AA has accelerated plans for a stock market flotation by selling off more than two-thirds of the \u00a31.4bn group to major City investors. Under the terms of a wider deal, three incoming directors including chairman Bob Mackenzie could receive up to \u00a320m between them over five years if the share price takes off. The flotation comes despite signs that investor enthusiasm for new issues may be flagging, including in the case of recently floated sister company Saga. The century-old car breakdown group, which boasts of being Britain's most trusted commercial brand, said it would list the business on the London stock exchange before the end of the month. The move came as shares in high street retailer Game Digital started trading in the City on Friday for the first time since it went bust two years ago, although the valuation is lower than it had hoped. Other recent flotations such as Saga, the over-50s insurance and cruise group, which like the AA is owned by Acromas Holdings, have also seen their share price fall over recent weeks. The decision by Acromas, itself controlled by private equity firms including CVC, to bring in 10 cornerstone investors including JP Morgan, Legal and General and Blackrock, takes the uncertainty out of the forthcoming IPO. Mackenzie, who is also the chairman of Northgate truck leasing, said: \"This is an acquisition. This deal has been done at \u00a3930m. They have effectively bought the company from the selling shareholders and we are extremely confident we can find more new investors [ahead of the float].\" If he does not then Acromas will hang on to its 31% stake until the float when \u00a3210m of new shares will be on offer to outside investors. Mackenzie, a former boss of AA's smaller rival Green Flag, will work alongside Chris Jansen, who took over as chief executive at the start of the year following a move from British Gas. Under the remuneration deal Mackenzie and two other board members, Martin Clarke and Nick Hewitt, will share 40% of a potential \u00a350m payout bonanza, and 60% will be allocated to an as yet undecided group of senior managers, including the chief executive. Jansen said on Friday night that a range of new initiatives would be launched to grow the business including a blitz on new technology to provide better diagnostic equipment for breakdowns, plus a new range of financial products and domestic services such as plumbing. The AA said it had produced profits of more than \u00a3100m in the three months to 30 April, but the business is also sitting on a \u00a33bn debt mountain. The value of stock market companies was booming until recently, on the back of a strong wider British economic recovery. Royal Mail and Foxton's estate agents saw their shares soar last year, while property advertising group Zoopla and the AA's chief rival the RAC have also said they may, or will, list shortly. But Fat Face, the clothes retailer, is among firms that have recently been forced to ditch plans to float amid signs the IPO bubble may have burst, while recent issues such as AO World have lagged below their issue price.",

The number of long-term unemployed (those jobless for 27 weeks or more) was essentially unchanged at 3.4 million in May.<b><br></b></p> <p>But the US continued to add jobs across the economy.

Acromas secured the backing of the big investors despite waning appetite for this year's rush of IPOs and criticism of its flotation of Saga, the AA's sister company. SF My colleague Dominic Rushe reports from New York on the US jobs figures. Here is an excerpt: The US added 217,000 new jobs in May, the fourth month in a row that the country has added over 200,000 new jobs and the most robust pace of change since 1999, the Commerce Department said on Friday. The unemployment rate stayed unchanged at 6.3%. The closely watched jobs report is the first since the Commerce Department cut its estimate of economic growth in the US late last month, triggering fears of an economic slowdown. The latest report from the bureau of labor statistics shows deep problems remain: unemployment for teenagers stayed at 19.2%, and for African Americans it was 11.5%. The number of long-term unemployed (those jobless for 27 weeks or more) was essentially unchanged at 3.4 million in May. But the US continued to add jobs across the economy. There were gains in professional and business services, healthcare and social assistance, food services and drinking places, and transportation and warehousing. Over the prior 12 months, nonfarm payroll employment growth has now averaged 197,000 per month. Dan Greenhaus, chief strategist at broker BTIG, said the last time the US economy had added over 200,000 jobs a month for four consecutive months was 1999. \u201cWhile many are waiting for a pickup in job growth, it\u2019s been clear to us for some time that 'this is it.' This is what we can do,\u201d he said in a note to clients. SF The FTSE 100 index is now trading 0.4% higher, or nearly 30 points, at 6840.62. Germany's Dax is 36.60 points, or 0.37%, ahead, at 9984.43 while France's CAC has gained 24.26 points, or 0.5%, to 4572.99. US Treasuries rose after the data, pushing the yield on the 10-year note to 2.56%. This increased the premium over the equivalent German Bund to 124 basis points \u2013 the highest since October 2005, according to Reuters data. May marked the fourth month of job growth in the US as the labour market bounced back from a lull seen during the winter months, and is seen as an important milestone in the American economy's recovery. Employment has increased by 8.8m since hitting a trough in February 2010. The US Labor Department said the US economy has now recovered all the 8.7m jobs lost during the recession. US non-farm payrolls are bang in line with expectations: the figures show 217,000 new jobs were created in the US in May, compared with 282,000 in April and 203,000 in March. The unemployment rate stayed at 6.3%, a 5 1/2 year low. At Thursday's annual meeting of security services group G4S, security guards violently removed more than a dozen protesting shareholders. You can watch the video here. My colleague Rupert Neate reported: Protesters, who bought shares in the firm in order to attend the meeting, were dragged out of the conference room in the Excel Centre, London, on Thursday after speaking out about its role supplying Israeli prisons and the death of an Angolan man while he was being deported by G4S guards. Moody\u2019s has just published its analysis of Thursday\u2019s policy announcements by the ECB. You can view the full report here. Overall, we think the measures are marginally credit positive for corporates and sovereigns, but broadly neutral (with positives and negatives) for banks. And while the economic impact of these actions is likely to be limited, their greatest significance of is the signal they send about ECB\u2019s willingness to adopt new policy measures.

The Spanish yield dropped to 2.661% against 2.665% for the UK ten-year bond. The Italian yield was 2.765%. Labour has responded to the IMF report. Ed Balls MP, Labour's shadow chancellor, said: The IMF is right to warn of the risks from an imbalanced housing market where housing demand is outstripping supply. But the Chancellor cannot simply pass the buck to the Bank of England, which has rightly said that it cannot build a single home. We have repeatedly called for action on housing supply and a Help to Build scheme alongside a reformed Help to Buy. Unless George Osborne finally acts the danger is that the Bank of England will be forced to raise interest rates prematurely. When even Ken Clarke admits most people aren't feeling the recovery and with growth forecast to slow next year, the chancellor's claims that the economy is fixed are dangerously complacent. We need to reform our economy for the long-term so we can earn our way to higher living standards for all, not just a few. Labour's plan will get at least 200,000 homes built a year, set up a proper British Investment Bank to support business investment and expand free childcare to make work pay. Some more comments from Christine Lagarde in full. She gave a press conference at the Treasury in Whitehall earlier. She said that the news coming out of the UK recently has been \"pretty much all good\". She also praised the UK's deficit reduction, saying that \"considerable work has been done\" since George Osborne became chancellor. We have recommended that some macro-prudential measures be considered by the UK authorities and that this be done with a view to addressing not so much house prices but financial risk. We also believe it should be done in a gradual, flexible way because the authorities need to assess whether those measures work, how they work. Clearly it is something that needs to be watched and depending on circumstances, on pricing levels, those macro-prudential measures should be further activated if necessary. IMF head Christine Lagarde ruled herself out of the race for the presidency of the European Commission. Here is her response in full. I'm not a candidate and the reason I'm not a candidate is that I have a job. It's a job that I happen to think is rather important at the moment, which the United Kingdom was kind enough to support me for at the time, which I have to do and which I intend to complete. As my young son would have said: 'Mum when you start something you've got to finish the job'. She warned that keeping interest rates low could further fuel house prices and cause financial instability, adding that the IMF's views on what the policy response should be broadly coincided with those of the UK authorities. ... But there are questions over this year's IMF report, given that last year its chief economist warned George Osborne that he was \"playing with fire\" with his fiscal policy. The IMF has called on the Bank of England to stand ready to rein in the housing market, in particular household debt. It also said interest rates should be raised first before action is taken to unwind the Bank's quantitative easing programme. Here are the two key pars from the IMF report: 6. Monetary policy should stay accommodative\u2014for now. With inflation below target, contained cost pressures, and excess supply, monetary policy should remain on hold. Policy might, however, have to be tightened quickly if costs run ahead of productivity growth, slack is absorbed, or financial stability concerns cannot otherwise be addressed. 7. Bank rate should be raised before reducing QE balances. When the time comes to begin normalizing monetary conditions, raising the policy rate first is preferable to selling off assets: should changing conditions require reversing the normalization, decreasing the policy rate would likely be less disruptive than repurchasing gilts. Stuff on housing from paragraph 9 onwards. The IMF says: Macroprudential policies should be the first line of defense against financial risks from the housing market. The objective of macroprudential policy is to address systemic financial risks, not house price growth. Some measures have already been taken. In particular, the Funding for Lending Scheme has been refocused towards businesses, with emphasis on SME loans, while household lending is no longer eligible for additional borrowing allowances. Underwriting standards for owner-occupier mortgages have been tightened to ensure better borrower protection. But in an environment where expectations of capital gains can quickly drive up household indebtedness\u2014and thus systemic risk for financial institutions\u2014more policy action is warranted. Here is the IMF's full annual appraisal of the UK economy. That concludes the press conference with IMF head Christine Lagarde. Back to productivity. Lagarde says: Low productivity is not specific to England. Canada is another case in point. It is pretty hard to understand the rationale and the causes behind it. The fact that capital expenditure has been so low could be one of the reasons, she added. Lagarde is asked whether rising inequality would hinder growth around the world. Rising inequalities do not support sustainable growth. Asked about whether she would want the EU Commission president job, Lagarde says she has a job and will serve her term as IMF head. There has been a lot of speculation \u2013 Reuters reported two days ago that German Chancellor Angela Merkel has asked France whether it would be willing to put forward Lagarde as president of the European Commission, citing two French sources briefed on the exchanges. Lagarde is asked whether she agrees with the chancellor that the UK economy is firing on all cylinders. She replies: The export cylinder is the one that could fire a little more strongly... The other two \u2013 consumption and on the investment front, not just public investment but private investment as well \u2013 the numbers rising. Lagarde admits that the IMF underestimated the strong rebound in the UK economy, but adds that they were not alone. Housing is the second big risk to the UK recovery, the IMF judges. \"Macro-prudential measures will suffice\" to rein in the housing market, Lagarde says. Clearly it is something that needs to be watched. Lagarde addresses the risk from low productivity growth first. We very much hope productivity will increase as we see investment pick up. The IMF report says: The durability of the recovery hinges on productivity growth, which remains well below historic norms. Accelerating productivity growth would spur investment and output, while allowing real wage increases without triggering inflation. If productivity continues to be flat, however, growth will eventually stall. The Q&amp;A has started at the Treasury. IMF head Christine Lagarde has been asked how big a risk the UK housing market is to the economic recovery. You can watch Christine Lagarde's press conference at the Treasury live here. To recap, George Osborne conceded this morning that a housing bubble remains a threat to the recovery following comments by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) in its annual appraisal of the UK economy. The chancellor said on BBC Radio 4 he agreed with IMF head Christine Lagarde's conclusion that Britain must keep a close eye on rising house prices and indebtedness. Here is our full story. The IMF report on the UK is out. While it acknowledges that the economy has \"rebounded strongly and growth is becoming more balanced,\" it highlights the housing market, and productivity growth that is \"well below historic norms,\" as key risks. The fund said: House price inflation is particularly high in London, and is becoming more widespread. So far, there are few of the typical signs of a credit-led bubble. Nonetheless, a steady increase in the size of new mortgages compared with borrower incomes suggests that households are gradually becoming more vulnerable to income and interest rate shocks. Time for a look at the markets. European stocks are edging up to hit fresh six-year highs and index futures suggest Wall Street could set a new record, ahead of key US jobs figures. The FTSE Eurofirst 300 is on course for its best close since January 2008 while futures indicate the S&amp;P 500 will add 1 point to Thursday's record close of 1,940.5. Non-farm payrolls, out at 1.30pm BST, are expected to show that 215,000 to 218,000 new jobs were created in May. The FTSE 100 index in London is nearly 20 points ahead at 6832.20, a 0.27% gain. Germany's Dax is up more than 20 points, or 0.2%, at 9968.32 \u2013 on Thursday it went through 10,000 \u2013 while France's CAC has inched up nearly 7 points, or 0.15%, to 4555.67. Italian, Spanish and Irish bond yields have hit fresh record lows. Expectations of an interest rate hike have increased among Britons \u2013 even though their expectations of higher inflation have receded. The Bank of England's quarterly inflation attitudes survey found that 42% of people expect a rate rise over the next 12 months, the highest proportion since May 2011. At the same time, inflation expectations over the next year have fallen to 2.6%, the lowest since February to 2010. In Rome, Pope Francis has sacked the entire board of the Vatican's financial watchdog, as part of efforts to reform the city state's banking practices following a corruption scandal \u2013 and amid reports of infighting among the \"old guard\". The Italian five-person board of the Financial Intelligence Authority were due to see their terms expire in 2016. The pope replaced them with four international experts from Italy, Singapore, Switzerland and the US. The Vatican said the new directors include Juan Zarate, a former national security adviser to US President George Bush, and Joseph Pillay, a civil servant and adviser to the president of Singapore. The other two new board members are Maria Bianca Farina, an executive at the Italian postal service and Marc Odendall, a Swiss financial consultant. Pope Francis has moved to stamp out corruption at the Vatican bank, officially known as the Institute for the Works of Religion. Rather than closing down the scandal-plagued institution he has opted for a reform plan. Britain's trade deficit widened in April because of weaker chemicals and manufacturing exports, official figures show. The Office for National Statistics said the deficit in trade in goods grew to an estimated \u00a38.9bn from \u00a38.3bn in March. It said its figures were an estimate owing to an omission in its calculations, which overlooked \u00a3700m of oil exports to the European Union. Including Britain's surplus in trade in services, the overall trade deficit widened to an estimated \u00a31.8bn from \u00a31.1bn in March. Turning back to corporate news, Game Digital, the videogame seller, has priced its flotation at a lower range in the latest sign of investor fatigue on initial public offerings, my colleague Sean Farrell reports. The company, which was rescued from bankruptcy two years ago, will sell shares at 200p a share, valuing it at \u00a3340m. On Thursday, Game Digital proposed a range of 200p to 2012p to investors as it priced the flotation. This year has been one of the busiest ever for the IPO market after a long period in the doldrums, with investors nvestors have bought new shares in search of companies with good growth prospects as the economy recovers. But after a feverish start to the year, fund managers are becoming more wary after a series of newly listed companies' shares dropped below their offer prices. Some investors have complained that high valuations have left little incentive to take the risk of buying before the stock starts trading. Hours before IMF head Christine Lagarde will present the fund's annual assessment of the UK economy, the chancellor, George Osborne, said he agreed with her conclusion that Britain must keep a close eye on rising house prices and indebtedness. House prices are rising at their fastest rate since the start of the financial crisis, prompting Bank of England governor Mark Carney to describe the housing market as the greatest domestic risk to Britain's financial stability. Speaking on BBC Radio 4, Osborne said: I agree with Christine Lagarde that we need to be alert to the build-up of debt in the housing market. We need to be alert when we see house prices rising. I have given the Bank of England tools to do the job, and they should not hesitate to use those tools if they see these developments turning into a risk to the British economy. Following her presentation at the Treasury this morning, the IMF's head Christine Lagarde is due to speak at the London School of Economics tonight. She's giving the Amartya Sen Lecture \u2013 speaking on the theme of \"empowerment\" \u2013 from 6.30-8pm BST. The event is open to LSE staff and students (and the media), but not the public. It is notable that there was very strong growth in vision, where sales were up 47% year-on-year. This was clearly boosted by a number of people upgrading their TV\u2019s to enjoy the football World Cup to the maximum. This tends to happen before any extended, major sporting event. There will also be a boost to spending from people buying World Cup souvenirs, England replica shirts etc. Also people tend to spend more on food and drink, as well as on takeaways during the tournament, as well as on takeaways, to fully enjoy the matches at home. The better England do and the more games they play, the bigger the potential beneficial impact to retail sales. And if England do well, it could give a small, temporary boost to consumer confidence, although this is already elevated at the moment. However, some of this spending will be diverted from what would have been spent on other items. And if England crash out in the group stage, there will be a lot of England paraphernalia available at reduced prices in bargain bins! The fact that all of the England games take place in the evening or at night will lessen the negative impact on productivity that comes from people stopping work to watch the matches. Analysts at Daiwa have digested Thursday's ECB action. While no magic bullet for the woes of the euro area, this package clearly has its merits. It should at least provide some incentive to increase bank lending. It should also help to contain the episodic short-term bank funding pressures due to excess liquidity from previous LTROs draining from the system. And the rate cuts should help to decouple euro-denominated interest rates from those of dollars over coming quarters as the markets move to price in Fed tightening. Moreover, the ECB now looks to have gone as far as it can possibly go before launching a conventional QE programme of purchases of a wide range of assets including sovereign bonds. That of course would be a far more powerful measure. But until we see a further deterioration in the economic outlook, this bazooka will remain in the locker. Meanwhile, bond yields in troubled eurozone countries have hit fresh record lows, amid relief over the ECB's stimulus measures announced on Thursday. Italy's 10-year bond yield opened 8 basis points lower, hitting a new record low of 2.87%. Spain's 10-year yield dropped 7 bps to a fresh low of 2.76% and Ireland's yield also fell 7 bps, to a record low of 2.51%. European stocks have got off to a good start, rounding off a good week \u2013 the eighth consecutive week of gains. Germany's Dax and France's CAC have edged up 0.1% while Spain's Ibex and Italy's FTSE MiB have opened 0.4% higher. In London, the FTSE 100 index has gained 0.2%, or over 16 points, to 6829.20. Shares in British Gas owner Centrica rose 2.2%, amid rumours of a bid from the Middle East. The Daily Mail cited \"gossip\" that Qatari investors had approached shareholders with an offer to buy \"big lines of stock\" before launching a full-scale bid. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of events across the financial markets, the global economy, the eurozone and business. The International Monetary Fund is set to make a U-turn and largely abandon its criticism of Britain's economic strategy. The fund has done its annual economic inspection and will present its initial findings this morning at 11.30am BST. Christine Lagarde, the IMF's managing director, will do the presentation herself in the UK Treasury, in front of an audience that includes the chancellor. Last year, her deputy, David Lipton, presented the report. European stock markets have opened higher, a day after the European Central Bank unveiled a package of bold measures in an attempt to revive the eurozone's fledgling recovery and ward off a damaging deflationary spiral. In a historic move, the ECB cut the deposit rate for the region's commercial banks to -0.1% from zero. This means commercial banks will have to pay it to deposit funds at the ECB. The central bank also cut its main interest rate to a new record low of 0.15% from 0.25%, and announced a \u20ac400bn (\u00a3325bn) package of cheap funding for banks. On the data front, German industrial production rose 0.2% in April, after a 0.6% decline the previous month, Germany's Federal Statistics Office in Wiesbaden said this morning. The bounceback wasn't as strong as expected. But German exports posted their biggest increase in nearly two years, rising 3% in April, signalling a strong start to the second quarter in Europe's largest economy. Over here, UK trade figures for April will be released at 9.30am BST. But today's highlight is US non-farm payrolls, which are forecast to show more than 200,000 jobs were created in May. The figures are out at 1.30pm BST.",

That was good because when I started this company what we did was to call up all our former employees, and they were very friendly.\" Zacconi reunited his best people, including chief creative officer Sebastian Knutsson, who now runs the firm's Stockholm studios, the crucible from which King's most successful games have emerged. Zacconi applauds the government's decision this year to grant tax breaks to games produced in the UK, an extension of the film credits that have attracted dozens of Hollywood productions to Britain. \"This new incentive for the games industry is great,\" he says, \"because I believe from the UK you can conquer the world.\" King's key statistics 352 million people play one of its games every month 97 million people a day play Candy Crush 1.4bn games played every day Candy Crush accounts for 67% of money spent by players The company has three titles among the top 10 grossing games on Apple's App Store, Google Play and Facebook",

      "bodyText": "King Digital is to open a second London studio this summer, taking over the Covent Garden office currently occupied by Facebook. With around 80 people per studio, the games developer is expected to increase its UK workforce to around 160. The Anglo-Swedish company is using the $330m (\u00a3196m) raised in a New York stock exchange listing in March to recruit designers and speed up the creation of new games. It is developing a sequel to Candy Crush Saga , which became the most profitable smartphone game ever last year. A sequel to its first Facebook and smartphone title, Bubble Witch, Bubble Witch Saga 2, has been released for iPhone and Android. The investment comes as the British government extends the tax credit system that boosted Hollywood and domestic film and television production in the UK to the games industry. King already has seven games studios based in Stockholm, Malmo, Bucharest, Barcelona and Berlin. \"The UK is great for startups,\" said King's CEO, Riccardo Zacconi. \"This new incentive for the games industry is great because I believe that \u2013 like we did \u2013 from the UK you can conquer the world.\" In recent years, the British games sector has seen studios closed and jobs lost as international developers moved their workforces to countries offering tax breaks, such as Canada. King's decision to open a second studio in the UK is not connected to the tax relief, but it may be a benefit. The government scheme is expected to provide \u00a335m a year of support to games developers, according to industry lobby group TIGA. Companies making games using British teams and facilities, with culturally British content, will be able to claim cash back equal to 25% of qualifying production costs. King games are played 1.4bn times a day, with 97 million people a day trying their hand at Candy Crush Saga, the confectionery-themed game where players have to make sweets explode by lining up three or more of the same colour. With 352 million unique users a month, King says more people play its games than live in the United States. King's new studio will be based in a brick warehouse at 42 Earlham Street in Covent Garden, home to Facebook's British staff and its European boss Nicola Mendelsohn since 2012. Facebook wants to double its headcount from 250 to 500 and has taken a lease on 10 Brock Street in Euston, which will also house Twitter and Debenhams.",

      "bodyText": "Christine likes George. And George likes Christine. The International Monetary Fund is back with the programme, once again giving its full-throated backing to the government's economic policy. Not a mention of \"playing with fire\" or calls for higher public spending on infrastructure projects. All is well with the world. Or is it? Examination of the IMF's annual report on the state of the UK economy shows Christine Lagarde has two big concerns. The first is about the weakness of productivity, which the IMF fears will derail the recovery unless it starts to pick up. The second, more immediate threat, hails from the housing market, where rising prices are leaving more and more people vulnerable to higher interest rates. And the day when borrowing costs need to rise is coming closer, the IMF says. Its report on Britain says that the emergency 0.5% bank rate should stay in place \"for now\", while Lagarde said at a Treasury-hosted press conference that keeping interest rates low could fuel house price increases. So, while the IMF had some nice things to say about the UK recovery becoming better balanced, it is leaving its options open just in case what has happened over the past year or so turns out to be short-lived. Based on the evidence of history, these are well founded concerns. Britain has tended to be an inflation-prone economy, and persistent weakness in productivity would mean that a continuation of growth at current levels will pretty rapidly lead to the economy running up against capacity constraints. Inflation will start rising, the Bank of England will slam on the brakes and the recovery will stall. Boom-busts in the property market have been another big feature of the past four decades. An abundance of cheap money leads to higher demand for housing, rising prices, irrational exuberance, excessive debt, policy tightening and a property crash \u2013 usually in that order. The IMF does not think this is a credit-bubble yet, but is worried that that might be the eventual outcome. The warning to the Treasury and the Bank on housing was pointed. Action is needed now to head off the risks of another boom-bust. That should start with the meeting of the Bank's financial policy committee the week after next, the IMF made clear. In the first instance, it would like to see limits on the number of high loan-to-income (LTI) mortages. If that proves insufficient, it thinks outright caps on LTIs and on loan-to-value ratios should be considered. It also politely suggested to Osborne that he might want to rein in the mortgage subsidies offered under Help to Buy, and think about whether the scheme really needs to run for its full three years. The IMF's yearly health check was, therefore, a bit more nuanced than it might have looked. Britain is not top of the IMF's list of immediate concerns: a hard landing in China and deflation in the eurozone are seen as more pressing risks. But the IMF has put down important markers so that in the event that things go pear-shaped it can say: we told you so.",

Action is needed now to head off the risks of another boom-bust. That should start with the meeting of the Bank's financial policy committee the week after next, the IMF made clear. In the first instance, it would like to see limits on the number of high loan-to-income (LTI) mortages. If that proves insufficient, it thinks outright caps on LTIs and on loan-to-value ratios should be considered. It also politely suggested to Osborne that he might want to rein in the mortgage subsidies offered under Help to Buy, and think about whether the scheme really needs to run for its full three years.</p> <p>The IMF's yearly health check was, therefore, a bit more nuanced than it might have looked. Britain is not top of the IMF's list of immediate concerns: a hard landing in China and deflation in the eurozone are seen as more pressing risks. But the IMF has put down important markers so that in the event that things go pear-shaped it can say: we told you so.</p>",
