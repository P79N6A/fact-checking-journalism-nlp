      "body": "<p>Sports Direct's Irish partner is in talks to buy a struggling sports retailer in the Republic after founder Mike Ashley flew to Dublin at the weekend to weigh in on a rival deal.</p> <p>Elverys, the oldest sports chain in Ireland with 55 stores, was to be sold to a management buyout team backed by Irish financial firm Capnua. David Carson of Deloitte was lined up to be appointed receiver by the weekend as part of a pre-pack receivership deal.</p> <p>However, after Ashley missed his football team Newcastle United's match with Sunderland on Saturday to personally intervene, Deloitte has yet to be appointed. It is understood that Ashley has offered to pay \u20ac2.5m more than the \u20ac10m offered by the Elverys management and talks are continuing. Rival chain Lifestyle Sports is also rumoured to be interested in buying Elverys.</p> <p>Elverys has been on the market for some months as part of efforts by its owners John and James Staunton to settle debts with Ireland's National Asset Management Agency, the \"bad bank\" that took on property development loans in the wake of the financial crash.</p> <p>Corporate finance house IBI ran an auction process last year.

      "bodyText": "Sports Direct's Irish partner is in talks to buy a struggling sports retailer in the Republic after founder Mike Ashley flew to Dublin at the weekend to weigh in on a rival deal. Elverys, the oldest sports chain in Ireland with 55 stores, was to be sold to a management buyout team backed by Irish financial firm Capnua. David Carson of Deloitte was lined up to be appointed receiver by the weekend as part of a pre-pack receivership deal. However, after Ashley missed his football team Newcastle United's match with Sunderland on Saturday to personally intervene, Deloitte has yet to be appointed. It is understood that Ashley has offered to pay \u20ac2.5m more than the \u20ac10m offered by the Elverys management and talks are continuing. Rival chain Lifestyle Sports is also rumoured to be interested in buying Elverys. Elverys has been on the market for some months as part of efforts by its owners John and James Staunton to settle debts with Ireland's National Asset Management Agency, the \"bad bank\" that took on property development loans in the wake of the financial crash. Corporate finance house IBI ran an auction process last year. However, both Sports Direct and Lifestyle Sports are said to have complained that they were shut out of the present deal. Buying Elverys would consolidate Sports Direct's position in Ireland where it has 26 of its own-branded stores, has recently launched online and owns a 50% stake in the Heatons department store chain, which has nearly 50 stores across Northern Ireland and the Republic. \"Elverys could be a very cost effective way into a complimentary market,\" said Clive Black, an analyst at Shore Capital. \"It's a small market but has the same language and more cultural similarities than differences.\" The talks follow Sports Direct's recent international acquisitions as the business takes its low-price model to new countries, having triumphed over rivals such as JJB Sports in the UK.

    "webTitle": "Barclays chief Antony Jenkins turns down bonus but gets \u00a34m in shares", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Barclays will risk fresh controversy over bankers' pay next month when it hands its chief executive, Antony Jenkins, shares worth \u00a34m. The bank, which last year tapped its shareholders for \u00a35.8bn of cash to bolster its financial strength, will make the official disclosure about Jenkins and other payments to senior executives in mid-March. The bank faced fierce criticism last year when it announced to the stock exchange that it was handing almost \u00a340m of bonuses to its top management team while George Osborne was delivering his budget speech. On Monday night Barclays said that Jenkins had decided to waive his annual bonus for 2013 \u2013 a separate payment to the shares payout. He also waived his 2012 bonus. In a statement Jenkins said he was forgoing the payout \u2013 which could have been up to 250% of his \u00a31.1m annual basic salary (or \u00a32.75m) \u2013 as a result of the rights issue, the costs of \"legacy litigation and conduct issues in 2013\" and the cost of pulling out of some operations. He added: \"I have concluded that it would not be right, in the circumstances, for me to accept a bonus for 2013, and I have therefore respectfully declined the one offered to me by the board.\" The \u00a34m shares payout to Jenkins \u2013 the result of awards made in previous years \u2013 comes amid heightened tensions about bankers' pay as a result of the EU's cap on annual bonuses. The new rule limits payouts to 100% of salary or 200% if the bank wins shareholder approval. Like other banks, Barclays is expected to ask its shareholders to vote at the annual meeting in the spring to allow bonuses worth 200% of salary to be paid to staff. It has also told its investment bankers that it is planning on handing them a third payment \u2013 an allowance \u2013 to help push up their pay levels back to levels they might have expected before the bonus cap. Other banks are working on similar schemes, including Royal Bank of Scotland, whose top management team said last week they would waive bonuses for 2013 following the admission that the bank would slump to a \u00a38bn loss. However, long-term bonus schemes could still pay out. Europe-based staff of US banks are also affected by the cap and Bank of America Merrill Lynch is reported to be increasing the basic pay of its managing directors by 20% in anticipation of the bonus cap, while Goldman Sachs \u2013 whose boss, Lloyd Blankfein, is reported to be in line for \u00a314m of total pay for 2013 \u2013 is also examining ways to maintain payouts to staff. The potential \u00a34m payout for Jenkins was outlined in last year's annual report and shows he stands to receive 1.9m shares. The exact value of the bonus will depend on the share price on the day. Jenkins has set out a plan to make Barclays the \"go to\" bank since taking over from Bob Diamond in September 2012. He will announce the bank's 2013 results on 11 February, kicking off the annual reporting season for the banking sector. He will also set out commitments to show the bank's new approach in the wake of the \u00a3290m fine for rigging Libor .",

      "body": "<p><strong> </strong></p> <p>Barclays will risk fresh controversy over bankers' pay next month when it hands its chief executive, Antony Jenkins, shares worth \u00a34m.</p> <p>The bank, which last year tapped its shareholders for \u00a35.8bn of cash to bolster its financial strength, will make the official disclosure about Jenkins and other payments to senior executives in mid-March.</p> <p>The bank faced fierce criticism last year when it announced to the stock exchange that it was handing almost \u00a340m of bonuses to its top management team while George Osborne was delivering his budget speech.</p> <p>On Monday night Barclays said that Jenkins had decided to waive his annual bonus for 2013 \u2013 a separate payment to the shares payout. He also waived his 2012 bonus.</p> <p>In a statement Jenkins said he was forgoing the payout \u2013 which could have been up to 250% of his \u00a31.1m annual basic salary (or \u00a32.75m) \u2013 as a result of the rights issue, the costs of \"legacy litigation and conduct issues in 2013\" and the cost of pulling out of some operations. He added: \"I have concluded that it would not be right, in the circumstances, for me to accept a bonus for 2013, and I have therefore respectfully declined the one offered to me by the board.\"</p> <p>The \u00a34m shares payout to Jenkins \u2013 the result of awards made in previous years \u2013 comes amid heightened tensions about bankers' pay as a result of the EU's cap on annual bonuses. The new rule limits payouts to 100% of salary or 200% if the bank wins shareholder approval.</p> <p>Like other banks, Barclays is expected to ask its shareholders to vote at the annual meeting in the spring to allow bonuses worth 200% of salary to be paid to staff. It has also told its investment bankers that it is planning on handing them a third payment \u2013 an allowance \u2013 to help push up their pay levels back to levels they might have expected before the bonus cap.</p> <p>Other banks are working on similar schemes, including Royal Bank of Scotland, whose top management team said last week they would waive bonuses for 2013 following the admission that the bank would slump to a \u00a38bn loss. However, long-term bonus schemes could still pay out.</p> <p>Europe-based staff of US banks are also affected by the cap and Bank of America Merrill Lynch is reported to be increasing the basic pay of its managing directors by 20% in anticipation of the bonus cap, while Goldman Sachs \u2013 whose boss, Lloyd Blankfein, is reported to be in line for \u00a314m of total pay for 2013 \u2013 is also examining ways to maintain payouts to staff.</p> <p>The potential \u00a34m payout for Jenkins was outlined in last year's annual report and shows he stands to receive 1.9m shares. The exact value of the bonus will depend on the share price on the day. Jenkins has set out a plan to make Barclays the \"go to\" bank since taking over from Bob Diamond in September 2012. He will announce the bank's 2013 results on 11 February, kicking off the annual reporting season for the banking sector.</p> <p>He will also set out commitments to show the bank's new approach in the wake of the \u00a3290m fine for rigging Libor .</p>",

Indeed, the talk of the town today is that the aid package will be concluded by April \u2013 one month before crucial European elections in May and two before the country\u2019s current programme ends in June. But the big challenge for Athens is that the accord comes without the tough conditions attached to the loan agreements twice bailed-out Greece has signed since May 2010. This has increased the pressure on prime minister Antonis Samaras\u2019 shaky coalition government to not only wrap up stalled negotiations with Greece\u2019s \u201ctroika\u201d of creditors at the EU, ECB and IMF speedily but to do so convincingly with figures \u201cthat will impress.\u201d</p> <p>With this in mind the Greek finance minister Yannis Stournaras recently told reporters that \u201cwe are expecting some very positive data which will strengthen our armoury\u201d adding that the prospect of such a \u201csurprise\u201d explained why Athens was in no rush to complete talks that have been stalled since September. Officials hinted that in addition to Greece\u2019s primary budget surplus topping an unexpected \u20ac1bn, they will soon have other figures that will prove that the country is on the road to growth and economic recovery. \u201cWe\u2019ll soon be in a position to arrive at an agreement under our own terms,\u201d one official was quoted as telling Ta Nea.</p> <p>The left-leaning daily, however, also highlighted the opposition of Germany\u2019s own left wing party, Die Linke, to the prospect of yet another bailout for Greece. The party, which has close ties to Syriza, Greece\u2019s radical left, anti-austerity main opposition, claimed the rescue programme would amount to \u201canother gift of billions of euro for the oligarchs and creditors of Greece.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe German government is waging a battle for so called reforms [that are] against the majority of the Greek people but it refuses, as does the European Commission, to call Greek oligarchs to account. It has thus become the advocate of millionaires.\u201d Echoing Germany\u2019s Bundesbank, Die Linke called for a wealth tax to be slapped on citizens of countries at risk of bankruptcy before they are saved by other European Union member states.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2014-02-03T16:33:09.874Z\">at 4.33pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-52efb89ae4b0e2b516f9ea25\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2014-02-03T15:42:44.087Z\">3.42pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">ISM report must be an aberration, says ING</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Here's Rob Carnell at ING on the manufacturing ISM report:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\ufeffJanuary\u2019s Manufacturing ISM is absolutely awful, which given that the US generally is performing quite well, makes us think that this must be an aberration \u2013 maybe a spillover from the Polar vortex (shipments were anecdotally hit very hard), or a response to sharp energy price spikes over that period (gas and heating oil rose very sharply at times).</p>Nearly all aspects of the survey were dreadful, the headline fell to 51.3 from 56.5. Whilst among the subcomponents, prices paid soared to 60.5 from 53.5; production fell to 54.8 from 61.7; and new orders dropped to 51.2 to 64.4 - the worst decline in thirty-three years! Inventories fell further below the 50 growth threshold, suggesting that the first quarter may see inventories subtracting from growth after being a strong contributor throughout 2013. New export orders held up far better, dropping only 0.5 points to 54.5 <br> With payrolls on Friday, this data suggests that the labour market figures for this month could well be disrupted again following earlier weather-related distortions to the December figure. Markets will most probably take the coming labour report with another grain of salt, and keep focussing on the ADP and unemployment rate.  We expect the US data to come bouncing back once normal weather resumes. </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-52efb2c1e4b0e2b516f9ea1a\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2014-02-03T15:19:46.741Z\">3.19pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>More on the disappointing ISM report from the US.

The survey is broadly consistent with 10,000 jobs being created per month in the manufacturing sector which, added to the signal from the flash services PMI, points to non-farm payroll growth in the region of 200,000 in January.</p> <p>\u201cThe improvement supports the view that the economy is withstanding the ongoing tapering by the Fed.

      "bodyText": "A late slump has sent European markets sharply lower. Earlier mixed manufacturing reports for January, with China disappointing but the eurozone generally positive, made investors slightly cautious. But the poor US ISM survey, especially the forward looking new orders index which dropped sharply, sent Wall Street lower, which in turn dragged down other markets with it. The final tally showed: \u2022 The FTSE 100 fell 0.69% or 44.78 points to 6465.66 \u2022 Germany's Dax dropped 1.29% to 9186.52 \u2022 France's Cac closed 1.39% to 4107.75 \u2022 Italy's FTSE MIB ended 2.63% lower at 18,907.16 \u2022 Spain's Ibex dropped 1.96% to 9725.4 On Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently 243 points or 1.5% lower. And on that sombre note, it's time to close up for the evening. Thanks for all the comments, and we'll be back tomorrow. Back with Greece, and reaction to the prospect of a third bailout has been big news in the country where the media is also making much of the opposition in Germany. Helena Smith reports. While there has been no official reaction to the news, well-placed insiders at the finance ministry are certainly not denying that a third rescue package for debt-ridden Greece is in the making. Indeed, the talk of the town today is that the aid package will be concluded by April \u2013 one month before crucial European elections in May and two before the country\u2019s current programme ends in June. But the big challenge for Athens is that the accord comes without the tough conditions attached to the loan agreements twice bailed-out Greece has signed since May 2010. This has increased the pressure on prime minister Antonis Samaras\u2019 shaky coalition government to not only wrap up stalled negotiations with Greece\u2019s \u201ctroika\u201d of creditors at the EU, ECB and IMF speedily but to do so convincingly with figures \u201cthat will impress.\u201d With this in mind the Greek finance minister Yannis Stournaras recently told reporters that \u201cwe are expecting some very positive data which will strengthen our armoury\u201d adding that the prospect of such a \u201csurprise\u201d explained why Athens was in no rush to complete talks that have been stalled since September. Officials hinted that in addition to Greece\u2019s primary budget surplus topping an unexpected \u20ac1bn, they will soon have other figures that will prove that the country is on the road to growth and economic recovery. \u201cWe\u2019ll soon be in a position to arrive at an agreement under our own terms,\u201d one official was quoted as telling Ta Nea. The left-leaning daily, however, also highlighted the opposition of Germany\u2019s own left wing party, Die Linke, to the prospect of yet another bailout for Greece. The party, which has close ties to Syriza, Greece\u2019s radical left, anti-austerity main opposition, claimed the rescue programme would amount to \u201canother gift of billions of euro for the oligarchs and creditors of Greece.\u201d \u201cThe German government is waging a battle for so called reforms [that are] against the majority of the Greek people but it refuses, as does the European Commission, to call Greek oligarchs to account. It has thus become the advocate of millionaires.\u201d Echoing Germany\u2019s Bundesbank, Die Linke called for a wealth tax to be slapped on citizens of countries at risk of bankruptcy before they are saved by other European Union member states. Here's Rob Carnell at ING on the manufacturing ISM report: \ufeffJanuary\u2019s Manufacturing ISM is absolutely awful, which given that the US generally is performing quite well, makes us think that this must be an aberration \u2013 maybe a spillover from the Polar vortex (shipments were anecdotally hit very hard), or a response to sharp energy price spikes over that period (gas and heating oil rose very sharply at times).Nearly all aspects of the survey were dreadful, the headline fell to 51.3 from 56.5. Whilst among the subcomponents, prices paid soared to 60.5 from 53.5; production fell to 54.8 from 61.7; and new orders dropped to 51.2 to 64.4 - the worst decline in thirty-three years! Inventories fell further below the 50 growth threshold, suggesting that the first quarter may see inventories subtracting from growth after being a strong contributor throughout 2013. New export orders held up far better, dropping only 0.5 points to 54.5 With payrolls on Friday, this data suggests that the labour market figures for this month could well be disrupted again following earlier weather-related distortions to the December figure. Markets will most probably take the coming labour report with another grain of salt, and keep focussing on the ADP and unemployment rate. We expect the US data to come bouncing back once normal weather resumes. More on the disappointing ISM report from the US. Annalisa Piazza at Newedge Strategy said: \ufeffWe wouldn't read too much out of today's ISM. Business confidence might have also been affected by adverse weather conditions in Jan and a partial correction might be expected anytime soon. The Fed decided to continue its tapering cycle last week without seeing increasing downside risks for activity near term. The slow moderate trend in activity should continue going forward, supported by decent domestic demand and some improvement also in exports. The markets appear to have taken the numbers badly however, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average now down around 130 points. And it may not all be the weather: Not a particularly good start for Janet Yellen in her first day as chair of the US Federal Reserve as she takes over from Ben Bernanke. After the earlier news that the US manufacturing PMI came in at a three month low, the rival ISM report is also downbeat. The ISM's manufacturing PMI index came in at 51.3 in January compared to the forecast 56 and the previous month's 56.5p. New order growth slumped by the biggest amount in 33 years, pushing the overall index to an eight month low. Ahead of Friday's non-farm payroll numbers, the employment index fell from 55.8 in December to 52.3, the weakest since June. The report has sent the Dow Jones Industrial Average, slightly lower ahead of the announcement, down around 90 points. The TUC's senior economist has been looking at past IMF forecasts for the UK, with an interesting conclusion: The Brookings Institution has pulled off a coup -- it just announced that Ben Bernanke, who just stepped down as chairman of the US Federal Reserve last week, is joining as a Distinguished Fellow in Residence. As Brookings' David Wessel explains, Bernanke is just starting to unwind after eight years -- no more Fed meetings, or squinting blearily at the Asian markets the moment he wakes up*: \ufeffHe will, instead, have time to reflect on what just happened. \u201c I was kind of like if you're in a car wreck. You're mostly involved in trying to avoid going off the bridge. And then later on you say, \u2018Oh, my God,\u2019 \u201d he said here recently. * - more fun than it sounds, honest And with that, I\"m handing over to Nick Fletcher for the rest of the afternoon. Cheers, GW More manufacturing data - this time from America, showing that activity growth in the US factory sector slowed in January. Markit reported that the US manufacturing PMI came in at a three-month low of 53.7 last month, down from December's 55.0. That suggests the pace of expansion slowed during the rough winter weather, with some firms blamed disruptions from the extreme weather conditions at the start of January. Export orders also fell, but more encouragingly firms kept hiring. Chris Williamson of Markit reckons the underlying picture remains robust -- but policymakers will want to see activity bouncing back this month, and decent job creation in Friday's non-farm payroll stats. \u201cSurvey respondents reported the weakest growth of output and new orders for three months in January, but with many companies blaming exceptionally cold weather for production and supply chain disruptions, the underlying trend looks to have remained robust. \u201cThe ongoing expansion suggests that the goods producing sector is on course to contribute to another quarter of solid economic growth in the first quarter, and is also helping sustain a decent rate of job creation. The survey is broadly consistent with 10,000 jobs being created per month in the manufacturing sector which, added to the signal from the flash services PMI, points to non-farm payroll growth in the region of 200,000 in January. \u201cThe improvement supports the view that the economy is withstanding the ongoing tapering by the Fed. However, it will be important to see the indices bounce back from January\u2019s weather-related weakness to be sure of this resilience.\u201d Just in - some nice photos from the Philippine Stocks Exchange this morning, where dragon dancers marked the Chinese Lunar New Year. It wasn't enough to stop shares falling in Manila, where the main Philippine index closed 0.5% lower amid the wider emerging market selloff today. Recommended lunchtime reading: The Case of the Missing Bodies - A Sherlock Holmes Story Public anger in Greece remain high today, though. A group of protesters gathered outside tax offices in Athens this morning to urge government ministers not to allow homes to be repossessed from families who can no longer meet their debts, or auctioned to pay their bills. Here's a few photos from the scene: The Greek government and the Troika have been locked in dispute for months over whether to maintain a suspension that prevents banks repossessing first homes (more details here) The news that Greek factories finally returned to growth last month, and talk of a third bailout, has also pushed shares higher in Athens. Bank stocks are leading the risers. up almost 5%. Greek government bonds have strengthened in value today, following these reports that a third bailout loan could be agreed by April. This has pushed down the yield, or interest rate, on 10-year Greek debt to around 8.53%, from 8.71% on Friday night. That's still a high rate of return (for comparison, Portuguese 10-year bonds are trading at a yield of 4.96%), but it shows Greek debt is being treated as a safer investment today. Earlier today the UK's City watchdog, the Financial Conduct Authority, published \"warning notices\" against two bankers related to the investigation into the rigging of the Libor interbank lending rate. Our Sean Farrell has taken a look, and reports: The notices, handed out in November but announced on Monday, are the first made public by the regulator since it gained the authority in October. They also show that the FCA is pursuing alleged Libor offenders through civil action. More here: Financial watchdog publishes Libor warnings to two bankers On, and full details of the ECB's new bank tests are online here: ECB makes progress with asset quality review, and confirms stress test parameters for comprehensive assessment One important point -- banks' holdings of some government bonds will be 'marked to market', meaning banks will have to face the consequences of holding assets that are currently trading below their face value. The tests will also show exactly how much sovereign debt each bank holds -- which could address fears that certain banks are stuffed with debt issued by their national government (the dreaded sovereign-banking feedback loop): Here's the relevant section from the ECB: Sovereign exposures in the held-to-maturity portfolios (HTM) will be treated in the same way as other credit exposures in that portfolio, i.e. the impact of the scenarios on the loss and default parameters will be calculated and will result in larger provisions. Meanwhile the same types of securities in the available-for-sale (AFS) and held-for-trading (HFT) portfolios will be marked-to-market, in line with the scenario employed. The effect of the gradual phasing-out of AFS prudential filters on sovereign exposures will be fully disclosed. In addition, bank holdings of sovereign exposures, and their respective maturities, will also be disclosed in full. Over in Frankfurt, the European Central Bank is outlining more details of this year's asset-quality review. ECB vide-president V\u00edtor Const\u00e2ncio has pledged that the stress tests will be rigorous: \ufeffWe will uphold the reputation of the ECB ... we will not put it at risk. Everything will be disclosed. Const\u00e2ncio also scotched the idea that the ECB might go soft on eurozone banks because of fears that Europe doesn't have strong enough backstops to help banks who fail the tests. He pledged: We will conduct an exercise that is very demanding and very rigorous. The ECB has also said that it expects to have finalised the \"bank-by-bank\" portfolio selection for the AQR by the middle of this month. Banks' who fail the ECB's baseline test will have to raise fresh capital in the 'nearer term', while those who are only fail against the \"adverse scenario\" will have more time to strengthen their balance sheets. The session is being streamed live here Has all this talk of emerging market problems left you struggling to remember which country is a fast-growing MINT, a reliable BRIC or a fractious member of the Fragile Five? Well, panic not - here's a handy chart from the TUC's Duncan Weldon, showing the main players in the emerging markets. Keen-eyed readers will have spotted the overlap -- which rather fuels the idea that you can't put countries into neat little boxes... This graph shows how the Indian stock market has taken a pummelling since investors started losing faith in emerging markets earlier this month, pushing the Sensex down to a two and a half-month low today. And here's the biggest fallers on the Sensex today: Emerging market jitters hit the Indian stock market today, sending shares falling to a two and a half-month low. The Sensex index fell 1.5%, or 304.59 points, to 20209. Manufacturing and auto stocks led the fallers, on fears that growth in developing countries could stall as central bankers raise borrowing costs to stem capital outflows and tackle inflation. The Telegraph's Bruno Waterfield also reckons a third Greek bailout is on the way: The German finance ministry has firmly denied reports that a third aid package for Greece could include a further debt haircut. Reuters' Berlin bureau has the details: \"There is no new situation regarding Greece,\" said spokesman Marco Semmelmann. Asked about the possibility of a debt writedown, he said: \"I can deny that categorically\". Weekly Der Spiegel reported this weekend that Berlin was preparing the ground for a third aid package for Greece of 10-20 billion euros which could include a further haircut affecting public creditors or a \"limited additional programme\" involving fresh funds from the European rescue fund. As Helena wrote last night, Germany appears to be inching towards agreeing a third loan for Greece, of perhaps \u20ac10bn to \u20ac20bn. Here's our full story on this morning's UK manufacturing data, by Katie Allen: UK manufacturers boosted by overseas orders Traders have been piling into the yen this morning, pushing Japan's currency up to a two-month high of \u00a5101.76 to the US dollar. That may cause further concern in Toyko -- where concern over the strengthening yen helped push the Nikkei into an official correction today. Back in the City, and Lloyds Banking Group is dragging down the market with a 3% drop in its share price. Lloyd's decision to set aside another \u00a31.8bn to cover PPI compensation (see 7.58am) appears to have sunk hopes that it might resume dividend payments when it announces its 2013 results later this month. Today's unscheduled statement warns that it aims to restart payments to shareholders in the second half of 2014. Here's our full story : Lloyds PPI compensation bill now close to \u00a310bn Economists have been chewing through this morning's manufacturing data from the eurozone (from here), and the UK (here) data, and reckon the factory sector made a decent start to 2014. Here's some reaction: Robert Wood of Berenberg Bank UK manufacturing is expanding solidly and is likely to continue doing so as the Eurozone gradually recovers its poise and easily available credit helps dynamic firms to take advantage of sterling still well below its pre-crisis levels. The rise in the new export orders balance was noteworthy. Ms Lee Hopley, Chief Economist at EEF: UK manufacturers have begun the year in positive mood, maintaining the solid activity trends seen during the second half of last year. With separate data showing a further improvement in manufacturing activity across the euro zone, this supports our forecast for UK manufacturing output to grow by 2.7% this year, the fastest rate of expansion in four years. Some doubts will persist, however, over the durability of this upturn given the ongoing weakness in investment spending and concerns over the impact of high energy costs across the sector. Carl Williamson of Lloyds Bank Commercial Banking: Buoyed by positive global macroeconomic indicators and the relatively settled trading environment that has emerged, manufacturers have renewed confidence to invest in capacity, plant, product development and the exploration of new markets. January\u2019s positive domestic demand and export figures shows the momentum gained in the sector during 2013 is set to continue this year. Jeremy Cook, chief economist at World First: \u201cGrowth in UK export orders was the strongest since February 2011 and, thankfully, shows that British exports are being demanded across the world as opposed to just in Europe. Jobs have moved higher too, with the pace of job creation close to a 2.5 year high. These are all encouraging numbers, but they will need to be sustained throughout this year and into the next if we are to see any meaningful rebalancing of the UK economy away from services towards manufacturing.\u201d Howard Archer of IHS Global Insight is cheered that all the eurozone's peripheral countries reported a rise in manufacturing activity in January (details here) Greece's long-awaited return to factory growth, and the pick-up in Spain and Italy, suggests the euro area's economy continues to recover, Archer said: Spanish manufacturing activity rise at the fastest rate for 45 months (up to 52.2 from 50.8) while Italian manufacturing expansion (down to 53.1 from 53.3) almost matched the 32-month high achieved in January. This fuels hopes that sustainable Spanish and Italian recovery really is now gradually developing. Furthermore, Greek manufacturing activity (up to 65-month high of 51.2 from 49.6) expanded in January for the first time since August 2009, suggesting that there is a real chance that Greek GDP could finally stop contracting overall in 2014. Britain's factory recovery continued in January with a faster rise in new orders, although the pace of increased slowed a little in January. Markit's monthly healthcheck of UK manufacturing showed another healthy rise in factory activity - with the UK PMI coming in at 56.7 for January. That's down on December's 57.2, but still well over the 50-point mark that shows whether activity rose. Indeed, it's still close to the fastest rates seen in over two decades. Encouragingly, firms reported increased demand from the domestic market and rising levels of new business from overseas. Markit reported a surge in demand for UK investment goods, and evidence that firms hired more workers to cope with the new demand. David Noble, chief executive officer at the Chartered Institute of Purchasing &amp; Supply, said the data bolstered hoped of a \"broad-based and fully fledged recovery\" in manufacturing. Whilst domestic demand continues to climb, it is the expansion overseas that promises continued growth. The illusive export market has long been heralded as the key to unlock UK economic growth and in manufacturing appears to be coming to fruition, with new business rates climbing fastest in nearly three years. This has enabled firms large and small, across the sector, to invest in staff, marking the ninth successive month on month increase in employment. The rate of growth in jobs has also remained close to November\u2019s two and a half year high. Whilst costs climbed yet again, firms were able to pass these on to customers, a further sign of bullishness across the sector. The full survey is online here, along with all the other PMI data -- including Greece's long-awaited return to factory growth. Europe's manufacturing sector continued to recovery in January, data firm Markit has reported, with the strongest rise in activity since May 2011. The overall eurozone manufacturing PMI (based on interviews with thousands of firms across the region) rose to 54.0 -- the highest reading in over two and half-years -- showing the recovery picking up pace, from December's 52.7. Any reading over 50 shows the sector expanded. Markit reported that factories saw an increase in new orders, leading to an higher backlog of work and an inc increased in job creation across the sector. Germany saw strong growth again (see here), while at the other end of the spectrum there was encouragement for Greece which reported the first rise in output for 55 months (see here) But France remained a laggard, with its factory output falling again, although at a slower pace (see here). Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit, said the eurozone manufacturing recovery gained \"significant further momentum\" in January. All the figures were higher than the 'flash' readings published two weeks ago. \u201cThe survey data indicate that manufacturing output across the eurozone is growing at a quarterly rate in excess of 1%, led by Germany, where the rate of increase is perhaps as strong as 3%. Encouragingly, France is also showing signs of stabilising, enjoying a welcome return to export growth, though manufacturing in the eurozone\u2019s second-largest member state remains in overall decline and a drag on the region. \u201cHowever, perhaps the most important development in the report is the further revival of manufacturing in the region\u2019s periphery. Both Italy and Spain are seeing robust growth of output and order books, and the Greek PMI\u2019s rise above 50 for the first time since August 2009 is an important signal of how even the most troubled member states are returning to growth. \u201cThe improving economic picture painted by the PMI, which is running at a level consistent with euro area GDP growth of 0.4-0.5% for the first quarter, takes the pressure off ECB policymakers to add more stimulus. Price pressures, and the threat of deflation, will no doubt remain a key concern for the ECB, especially as growth of both input costs and selling prices eased in January.\u201d At long, long, last, Greece's factory activity has risen in a sign that the country's long slump may be easing. But with job losses still up across the sector, any recovery hasn't yet reached the country's battered population. Markit's monthly PMI survey of the Greek manufacturing sector rose to 51.2 in January, up from 49.6 in December. That's the first time it's been over 50 points (separating expansion from contraction) since August 2009 -- before its long-running debt crisis exploded. Greek factories reported that production levels were up, and exports were a little higher. But the survey also showed that firms kept cutting prices, which will push Greece deeper into deflationary territory, and they kept cutting jobs. Phil Smith, the Markit economist who produced the report, said: \u201cSolid and accelerated increases in both output and new orders lifted the PMI to its highest level in close to five-and-a-half years in January, and perhaps more importantly above the 50.0 mark that distinguishes growth from contraction. A slight rise in new export orders contributed to the improved performance, though data inferred that it was the domestic market that provided the principal boost. \u201cDeflationary pressures persist, with firms lowering their prices again amid ongoing efforts to grow sales. A knock-on effect of this was a further squeeze on profitability, which in turn encouraged the advancement of productivity and more job losses.\u201d Another knock-out result for Germany -- its factory output grown at its fastest rate in 32 months. The German PMI surged to 56.5 in January, up from 54.3 in December, which is the strongest reading asince May 2011. New orders rose, as did the amount of work stacking up, which encouraged firms to hire more staff -- proving once again that Europe's largest economy is outperforming the rest of the eurozone. Oliver Kolodseike, economist at Markit and author of the report said Germany's manufacturing sector \"moved up a gear\" in January: The sharp rise in new work was supported by stronger demand from both domestic and foreign markets, with Asian countries and the US mentioned as sources of export growth. \u201cIt looks as if growth is now also translating into meaningful job creation, with companies hiring new workers for a second straight month. The increase in employment levels highlights greater confidence about upcoming workloads, which was also supported by the steepest rise in backlogs in over two-and-a-half years. \u201cThe German economy looks set for a strong performance in the first quarter of the year, which comes as a relief after official data indicated that German GDP increased a disappointing 0.4% in 2013.\u201d France's factory activity fell again in January, but it may be close to the bottom. The French manufacturing PMI rose to 49.3 in January, from a pretty unimpressive 47.0 in December. That still shows a contraction, but at a much slower pace. Now Italy -- its manufacturing sector grew again in January, but a little slower than in December. The Italian manufacturing PMI came in at 53.1, slightly below December's 53.3 - but still showing solid growth. Markit also had worrying news for Russia -- its manufacturing activity fell to its lowest level in 55 months in January. Output fell, new orders declined again, and manufacturers laid off more staff, which must add to fears that the Russian economy is stagnating (there's a good piece about this in this weeks' Economist). The overall Russian Markit PMI fell to 48.0 from 48.8, showing the country's factory sector shrank last month. Alexander Morozov, HSBC's chief economist, warned that Russian private consumption, which has driven growth recently, is tailing off. \u201cManufacturers started the year on a minor note, the January HSBC Russia Manufacturing PMI survey found. Indeed, all key economic activity indicators point to a broad-based contraction. Notably, manufacturing output decreased for the first time since July last year. In conjunction with the reported decline in new orders, ongoing cuts in staffing, faster suppliers\u2019 delivery times and a stronger rise in output prices, the overall picture in manufacturing looks pretty gloomy. Here's the full report. The Netherlands factory sector, though, reported slower growth in January - with its manufacturing PMI falling to 54.8 from 57 in December. That's still comfortably above the 50-point mark that separates expansion from contraction, but suggest the sector was a little weaker last month. Markit also reported a manufacturing slowdown in Turkey (whose PMI fell from 55.0 to 52.7) Some early reaction to the encouraging Spanish manufacturing data: Good news from Spain, as the first surveys of European manufacturing in January start to flood in. Spain's factory output rose at its fastest pace in 41 months, according to Markit's monthly survey of its manufacturing base (the PMI or Purchasing Managers index). And employment in the sector rose for the first time since October 2010. The overall Spanish PMI came in at 52.2 in January, up from 50.8 in December, which shows the sector expanded at a faster pace [any reading over 50=growth] Andrew Harker, senior economist at Markit and author of the report, said: \u201cThere is a sense of optimism in the Spanish manufacturing sector at the start of 2014, with the PMI data for January suggesting that an economic recovery in the sector may be getting underway. The expansion in output quickened to the sharpest in close to three-and-a-half years, with success in export markets fuelling growth. One of the most positive aspects of the latest survey was a rise in employment, which suggests that firms have some confidence in the sustainability of the recent increases in workloads \u2013 something we haven\u2019t seen for some time.\u201d That's a good start for the eurozone -- with data from Italy, Germany and France all awaited... European stock markets have shaken off the Nikkei's woes, and are moving a little higher in early trading. The FTSE 100 is up 9 points, or 0.15%, at 6520, with the other main indices slightly higher. Heads-up: The European Central Bank is expected to release more information about its banking stress tests this morning. Reuters reports that this will include details of how the ECB will judge if loans have turned bad, and what the next step would be. An important eurozone story broke over the weekend -- that Germany is inching towards granting Greece a third bailout loan to cover the looming shortfall in its finances this year. At up to \u20ac20bn, the deal would be smaller than previous packages -- and could be conditional on Athens delivering its promised economic reforms. From Athens, Helena Smith reported Germany has signalled it is preparing a third rescue package for Greece\u2013 provided the debt-stricken country implements \"rigorous\"austerity measures blamed for record levels of unemployment and a dramatic drop in GDP. The new loan, outlined in a five-page position paper by Berlin's finance ministry, would be worth between \u20ac10bn to \u20ac20bn (\u00a38bn-16bn), according to the German weekly Der Spiegel, which was leaked the document. Such an amount would chime with comments made by the German finance minister, Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble, who, in a separate interview due to be published on Monday insisted that any additional aid required by Athens would be \"far smaller\" than the \u20ac240bn it had received so far. \"What is sure is that any further aid would be much less expansive than whatever help [has been given] so far,\" he is quoted as telling the German finance magazine Wirtschaftswoche in what appears to be a calibrated move aimed at preparing public opinion. More here: Germany preparing third financial rescue for Greece The deal appears to have been developed on the sidelines of last week's eurogroup finance ministers meetings, as the WSJ explains here. Will the Payment Protection Insurance scandal never end? Lloyds Banking Group has told shareholders this morning that it's setting aside another \u00a31.8bn to cover PPI compensation payments -- taking its total bill close to \u00a310bn. It's also set aside a further \u00a3180m to compensate firms who were wrongly sold products that hedged their exposure to interest rate rises (leaving many nursing hefty losses). The announcement (online here) also states that Lloyds will (finally) propose resuming dividend payments in the second half of this financial year (there had been hopes it could come sooner). And it confirmed that \"preparatory work\" for future sales of the taxpayer's stake in Lloyds is underway, as flagged up by chancellor George Osborne in last autumn's Mansion House statement. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the financial markets, the world economy, eurozone and business. Fears of an emerging market crisis and a global slowdown have driven Japan's stock market down into Correction territory, as investors begin the week in nervous mood. The Nikkei has fallen another 2% today, to its lowest level in two and a half-months. It shed another 295 points to 14619, meaning 10% has been wiped off the index since hitting its highest level since summer 2007 on the final trading day of 2013. As company stocks fell in Tokyo, the yen rose as traders shifted money back into the safe-haven of the Japanese currency -- strengthening the yen, and undermining the government's efforts to stimulate inflation. Hiroaki Hiwada, strategist at Toyo Securities Co, told AP: There is little good news to trade on. Maybe by next week, people will start to buy shares back. Chris Weston of IG was blunter, saying: Price action in the Nikkei looks fairly sick right now... Having been one of the best performers last year, the Nikkei has been hit hard in recent weeks by concerns that emerging markets are heading for a fall. A survey released on Saturday showing a slowdown in China's factory sector had added to concerns that the world economy is entering a softer period. Commodities are also under pressure this morning, with Brent crude oil dipping to a two-week low of $106 per barrel. European stock markets are expected to fall a little this morning, as last week's turbulence reverberates through trading floors. Risky assets are have fallen out of favour, as investors wonder whether the outflow from capital markets -- which already prompted Turkey, India and South Africa to raise rates - will turn into a torrent. Ian Williams of Peel Hunt argues that recent company results haven't given much support either, saying: \ufeffThe outbreak of nervousness in risk assets has been attributed mainly to a combination of Fed tapering, Chinese growth concerns and emerging market currency volatility; we suspect the lukewarm corporate earnings news is as big an issue for equity investors. I'll be tracking all the action through the day -- including details of the latest surveys of manufacturing activity across the globe.",

      "bodyText": "Let's be honest, this was not the announcement that Lloyds boss Ant\u00f3nio Horta-Os\u00f3rio wanted to make. The Portuguese banker had wound up City analysts to such an extent they had started to believe the bailed-out bank could start paying dividends as early as the full-year results in a fortnight's time. But another staggering provision for payment protection insurance mis-selling has put an end to any hopes of such a quick resumption of payouts to shareholders, which had been banned until last year under the terms imposed by the EU on the \u00a320bn 2008 bailout. The latest \u00a31.8bn for PPI takes the total now set aside by Lloyds to almost \u00a310bn. It is as if Lloyds had paid for the entire nation to have a 2.5p reduction in the basic rate of income tax for a year. Quite a bill for a bank whose previous boss, Eric Daniels, insisted Lloyds had been \"on the side of the angels\" when it came to PPI sales. Daniels may be history, but this management team also has some explaining to do. One minute Lloyds says the number of claims will start to wind down, now it says it expects a further 550,000 complaints to be made. It is amazing how the discipline of putting together a prospectus for a share sale to retail investors can focus the mind. While the bank is now six months behind on its dividend hopes, it is still rattling along in the process of getting the taxpayer off its shareholder register. After the formal results on 13 February, the next big date to watch is 6 March \u2013 the day the annual report is published. Aside from spelling out what bonuses are being clawed back from Daniels and other former executives, the fully audited results are an obvious moment for big City investors to be offered another tranche of shares, and shortly afterwards to push the button on the retail offering to small investors. Lloyds already has 2.7 million private investors, thanks to its rescue of HBOS (many of its investors had \"free\" Halifax shares), and it could get millions more through a retail offering. Then Horta-Os\u00f3rio's dividend promises will become an even more important story.",

      "bodyText": "The Financial Conduct Authority has published details of warning notices against two bankers over the rigging of the Libor interbank lending rate. The notices, handed out in November but announced on Monday, are the first made public by the regulator since it gained the authority in October. They also show that the FCA is pursuing alleged Libor offenders through civil action. The FCA said it warned a manager at a bank who for more than three years condoned traders asking rate submitters to rig Libor figures and submitters making submissions based on those requests. The manager enabled interest rate manipulation and allowed the same people to submit Libor numbers and trade derivatives linked to the benchmark. The watchdog issued the second warning to a banker who made Libor submissions based on traders' requests and colluded with an interdealer broker to manipulate the rate. The banker also colluded with traders at another bank by asking them to adjust their Libor submissions and responding to their requests to influence submissions. The banker involved also made Libor submissions based on the interest derivative positions they managed themselves. The FCA declined to say whether the bankers worked at the same bank or which banks were involved. The regulator's practice is not to name individuals unless it needs to do so to clear up speculation. The statements show that other people were involved, meaning further public warnings are likely. Releasing details aims to reassure the public at an earlier stage that the FCA is taking action. Libor is an interest rate used to set prices on \u00a3300tn worth of financial contracts around the world, from ordinary household mortgages to business loans. It was set by banks on a panel submitting figures for their borrowing costs to the British Bankers' Association. The scandal showed that the BBA's processes were not up to the job and administration was handed to US derivatives exchange Intercontinental Exchange, which started running the rate on Monday. During and before the financial crisis, traders and submitters of figures tried to manipulate the rate either to profit from their bets on interest rates or to disguise the cost of their bank's borrowing. The scandal forced former Barclays boss Bob Diamond out of his job and has cost banks such as Royal Bank of Scotland and Switzerland's UBS billions of pounds in fines.",

That was lower than the consensus forecast for 57.0 in a Reuters poll of economists but well above the 50-mark that separates expansion from contraction. Economists said the sector, which accounts for around a tenth of the UK economy, was still showing solid growth. \"UK manufacturing made a strong start to the new year, continuing the robust upsurge in production seen at the tail end of 2013,\" said Rob Dobson, senior economist at survey compilers Markit. \"Although the pace of output expansion has cooled slightly an recent months, growth is still tracking at one of the highest rates in the 22-year survey history.\" The report showed output growth eased with that index slipping to 59.4 from 60.4 in December. But reports of rising orders pointed to more strength ahead for factories. Growth in new export orders was at a three-year high with manufacturers citing improved demand from North America, mainland Europe, Asia, Brazil, Scandinavia and the Middle East. The stronger demand helped manufacturers pass on some of their rising costs with \"a further solid increase in average selling prices\", according to the report. Markit said responses from manufacturers about what was in demand in January also signalled the long-awaited recovery in business investment may be quietly beginning. \"Recent months have seen the largest surge in demand for UK investment goods for two decades,\" said Dobson. Signs of a pick-up in export demand and investment will be welcomed by the Treasury as it continues to push for a rebalancing in the UK economy away from reliance on domestic, consumer demand.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The cost of the payment protection mis-selling scandal has hit more than \u00a322bn after Lloyds Banking Group said it was setting aside an extra \u00a31.8bn to compensate customers. It takes the cost for Lloyds alone to just short of \u00a310bn after the bank, which is one-third owned by the taxpayer, revealed the extra costs in a surprise trading update less than two weeks before its annual results announcement. It was the seventh time the bank, owner of Halifax and Bank of Scotland, had increased its estimated bill for PPI \u2013 the biggest mis-selling scandal to hit the UK financial industry. Britain's banks and building societies have set aside a total \u00a322.2bn for PPI \u2013 enough to cover the cost of 2012 Olympics twice over. The amount is almost double the \u00a311.8bn bill for shoddy pension sales from the late 1980s to early 90s, and dwarfs the \u00a32.7bn for mortgage endowment mis-selling. George Culmer, Lloyds finance director, said predicting the cost of PPI was \"fiendishly hard\" but that the bank thought it had got the numbers right this time. \"It's a big number and it's obviously disappointing. There are always risks but we think it's appropriate.\" Lloyds shares were the biggest fallers in the FTSE 100 index, down nearly 4% to 80p. The PPI affair has dogged Britain's banks for years. They used high-pressure tactics to sell insurance designed to cover loan repayments if customers fell ill or became unemployed but in many cases the policies did not pay out or the buyer was not eligible in the first place. Britain's four biggest banks \u2013 Lloyds, Barclays, Royal Bank of Scotland and HSBC \u2013 together with Santander, which bought Abbey and Alliance &amp; Leicester, are responsible for about \u00a319.6bn of the total, according to the consumer group Which? Lloyds has avoided many of the scandals that emerged from the financial crisis such as sub-prime mortgages and Libor rigging but as Britain's biggest high street bank its PPI bill is almost half the total. Which? has calculated that many of the banks are close to using up all the money they set aside and that Lloyds' hefty extra charge indicates the costs could continue to rise for other banks, too. Which? executive director Richard Lloyd said: \"The cost of PPI mis-selling is a staggering \u00a322bn, and with banks continuing to increase their provisions it shows that they are still in denial about the size of this scandal.\" The financial ombudsman said last month it had 400,000 unresolved cases where customers had complained after being refused compensation by the banks. Lloyds said complaints fell towards the end of 2013 but that it no longer expects them to drop off as quickly as before. Its new forecast assumes a further 550,000 complaints. Last year the bank was fined \u00a34.3m for delaying PPI payments to 140,000 customers, and staff at one of its call centres were later revealed to be using tactics to deter potential claimants. The bank also announced an extra \u00a3130m to compensate small- and medium-sized businesses that were mis-sold interest rate hedging products, taking the total cost to \u00a3530m. Lloyds released the figures less than two weeks before its set-piece annual results because the extra costs were so big it was obliged to inform investors immediately. The mis-selling provisions may have scotched the bank's hopes of securing approval to resume paying a dividend. Lloyds said it would not ask the financial regulator to allow it to restart paying dividends until the second half of this year, scotching speculation that it might have restarted payouts with its 2013 annual results on 13 February. Many of Lloyds' 2.7 million shareholders held the shares for the dividend before it was forced to stop payments when it was bailed out in 2008. The bank said it had been in talks with the Prudential Regulation Authority about the dividend since the second half of last year. The bank also said it had started work on a sale of the 33% taxpayer stake to the public. Culmer said the prospectus for the share sale was well underway and the bank would be ready to proceed once it had audited financial results in March. The timing of the sale was up to the government, he added. The bank expects to announce an underlying profit of \u00a36.2bn for 2013, which it said would be ahead of City analyst forecasts and more than double that of 2012.",

      "bodyText": "The boss of Lloyds Banking Group will this week embark upon his own attempt to repair the reputation of Britain's battered banks by pledging to lend more to households and small businesses as well bolstering the number of women at senior level. Ant\u00f3nio Horta-Os\u00f3rio will set a target of 40% of the top 5,000 roles at the bailed-out bank to be held by women by 2020 \u2013 from 28% now \u2013 in a move welcomed by campaigners, who said it was the first such goal set by a FTSE-100 company. Under fire from the business secretary, Vince Cable, for making half its small business experts redundant, the chief executive of the bank, which is 33% owned by the taxpayer, will also set out goals to lend \u00a31bn more to small businesses this year in an attempt to demonstrate his commitment to the politically sensitive issue. Horta-Os\u00f3rio will use two speeches this week to also promise to help 80,000 first-time buyers into the housing market, just a fortnight before the bank's results are expected to clear the way for the government to sell off the remaining stake. \"The reputational impact of the financial crisis upon the banking industry's stature has been immense,\" he will say. \"Rebuilding a sound reputation founded on the highest standards of responsible behaviour is key to the industry's long-term success. \"But words alone are not enough to change public perception and regain trust. We must be able to provide meaningful commitments and allow ourselves to be independently measured against those,\" he says, dubbing his plan for \"helping Britain prosper\" \u2013 a slogan used by the bank for the last 18 months. Antony Jenkins, the boss of Barclays, indicated in December that he was also planning to make a series of pledges about the bank's behaviour. Lloyds was fined \u00a328m in December because of a bonus scheme that encouraged staff to sell products to customers who did not need them and Andrew Tyrie, the MP who chairs the Treasury select committee, has written on Monday to the chief executive of the Financial Conduct Authority, Martin Wheatley, to call for industry-wide changes to the bonus culture. Ahead of Wheatley's appearance before the committee on Tuesday, Tyrie said: \"Incentives have been deeply misaligned for significant numbers of frontline staff, not just highly remunerated traders or the most senior executives. Deep cultural change is needed.\". The bank's pledge on top roles for women prompted Helena Morrissey, chief executive of Newton fund managers and a campaigner for more women in boardrooms through the 30% Club, to call for other companies to follow suit. \"The 30% Club experience shows how a numeric, measurable goal can provide a useful focal point and it is exciting that Lloyds has decided to take a similar step \u2013 the first we are aware of from any FTSE-100 company \u2013 to accelerate progress. We look forward to seeing the results \u2013 and which company is next,\" she said. By 2015 Britain's biggest firms need to ensure 25% of the roles are held by women if they are to meet the targets set by Lord Davies \u2013 the former boss of Standard Chartered \u2013 to promote women into top jobs. Lloyds said it would also donate \u00a3100m to its charitable foundations and said more information would be released when it published its annual report on 6 March. The goal to help first-time buyers is greater than the one set for 2013 when it said loans would granted to 60,000 people buying property for the first time. For small businesses, the bank had pledged to keep lending positive last year.",

Market research firm Nielsen said 60% of Britons are seeking to reduce their electricity bills, 58% have cut back on expanding their wardrobes, 57% have cut out takeaways and 55% are switching to cheaper brands in the supermarket. The personal cutbacks come as UK consumer confidence recorded its first drop since the last quarter of 2011. The Neilsen poll of 30,000 people found consumer confidence in the last three months of last year dropped three points to 84, with levels above 100 indicating optimism, and levels below that indicating pessimism. Britons' confidence had reached a six-year high of 87 in the previous quarter. Chris Morley, managing director of Neilsen UK and Ireland, said: \"British consumers are increasingly recognising improvements in the economy, but they are still cautious and likely to continue to modify their buying and consumption habits to save money. \"This is in stark contrast to confidence levels in Germany, for example, where consumer cost-cutting is almost half the level it is here.\" German confidence is ahead on 95, up 3 points on the previous quarter.
