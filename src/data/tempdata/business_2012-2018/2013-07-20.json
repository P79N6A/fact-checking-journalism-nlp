      "bodyText": "Tesco's chief executive could be forgiven for being less than delighted to see me. For the last few months I have been Philip Clarke's baiter-in-chief. It's not just that I have been shamelessly promoting a book about food security that fingers supermarkets as one of the key culprits in a British farming crisis that has dangerously undermined our self-sufficiency. I have also clashed repeatedly with Clarke's spokespeople over Tesco initiatives to help people waste less food or eat more healthily. I kept pointing out how flimsy the initiatives seemed, how they were too focused on influencing consumer action rather than the retailer sorting out its own practices. After the second bruising encounter, Tesco asked whether I would like a quiet off-the-record chat with Clarke. I declined. Instead I suggested the sort of on-the-record interview Tesco chief execs do not do. To my surprise he said yes. \"That is why we're here,\" he agrees, when we meet in the company's St James's boardroom. Clarke is already having a less than perfect week. A few days ago Tesco was forced to acknowledge that he had lost his driving licence after speeding offences in his Jaguar. \"Phil regrets this matter and accepts the decision to suspend his licence,\" a terse statement read. And no, thank you, he wouldn't be discussing it further. Then again, put against the events of 2013 so far it's really no biggie; a chauffeur comes with the \u00a31.1m salary. A lost driving licence is nothing compared to a slump in pre-tax group profits of 51.5% or having to announce that, among others thing, they are pulling out of a failed retailing venture in the US at a cost of billions. And both of those pale into insignificance against the horsemeat scandal of January and February, which arguably did more damage to Tesco \u2013 four of their products were involved \u2013 than any other major retailer. In what feels like the nearest thing to a heart-searching interview as a FTSE 100 chief executive is ever going to get, Clarke is ready to acknowledge the damage to the brand. After all, they've done the research. \"It became clear that people thought Tesco was big and Tesco was bad,\" he says, a little glumly. He sounds personally wounded when he says: \"after 39 years in the business it surprised me.\" It's not what you expect of a Tesco big beast. The retailer, which has a worldwide turnover of nearly \u00a375bn, has long been famed for its hardnosed approach. Under former chief executive Sir Terry Leahy, who stepped down in 2011, it was all about high growth and big bargains rather than cuddly notions of customer care or reputation. In those days journalists' inquiries were generally met with a terse \"no comment\". Tesco felt no need to engage. Clarke may have things in common with Leahy. Both had modest beginnings in Liverpool and worked their way up through the business. Both now live in the same Hertfordshire village where Clarke, a married father of two grown-up children, likes to relax by horse riding. But where Leahy was chief exec as lean, charismatic rock star, Clarke is more the country grocer: comfortably upholstered, soft-spoken, ruminative. Certainly he seems in soul-baring mode. \"We were hearing that Tesco has got to put in more [to society] because people think that all we do is take out,\" he says. He points to a new \"core purpose\" recently added to the list on the boardroom wall: \"We use our scale for good.\" Really? Tesco wants to do more than just make dollops of cash? Yes, he says. He seems genuinely hurt that Tesco's post-horsemeat PR offensive \u2013 it ran full-page newspaper ads announcing it was \"changing\" \u2013 had been met with suspicion. Was he really surprised that people saw all that as little more than an attempt at reputation management? He admits it's understandable. \"People's memories tend to be dominated by certain events.\" Does he also understand that they are seen as failed custodians of the food supply chain? \"Yes, of course. When you have 30% of the retail trade it comes with responsibilities. And I bitterly regret that four of our products were laced with horsemeat.\" He admits that at the time he simply didn't believe it. \"I thought: 'This is impossible. We use the best suppliers. We take the most extraordinary pride in the food that we put on people's plates.'\" In the years preceding the horsemeat scandal, numerous suppliers had told me that the deals being forced on them by the big supermarkets were so brutal financially that something had to give. Contracts had been too short. Margins too tight. Farmers didn't have a guaranteed price. Contracts would be broken at the last minute. Huge numbers had simply quit farming as a result and our food self-sufficiency had slumped from a peak of more than 70% in the early 1990s to nearer 50% now. In February Clarke gave a remarkable speech promising a new relationship with British farmers. I suggest to him that the speech to the National Farmers Union indicated he thought that relationship had been unequal. \"I pretty much said it,\" he agrees. \"I chose my words carefully. I needed to acknowledge what our customers had been saying to us.\" Which is? \"We think you take out too much, we think you're too hard.\" A new poll for the Prince's Countryside Fund before National Countryside week, which begins tomorrow, backs that up. Over 80% of those polled believed it is important to buy British produce to support British farmers. So are they going to do that? He says yes. \"We've got to produce more food at home and we've got to make more and better deals with the producers.\" He says it means longer contracts allowing farmers to invest, and dealing with them directly rather than through intermediaries. In his NFU speech he denied this re-engineered relationship with producers would inevitably mean that \"food needs to become more expensive\". Surely he was being disingenuous? Isn't the 10% of income we in the UK spend on food (it's around 12% in the rest of the EU) too low? I know he understands the global context, the way the rise of the middle classes in China, India and elsewhere has led to a huge demand for food we thought was ours by right. He has more experience in the 13 countries in which Tesco trades than most of his board. He nods. \"There was a time when we could go to South Africa to buy fruit and be the only retailer there. Not any more.\" Which means food prices must rise? We are on sensitive territory here. Supermarket bosses run scared of talking about such things for fear of driving customers to the opposition and damaging share value. Only Mark Price, boss of Waitrose, whose affluent customers are less price-sensitive, has broken ranks to admit such inflation is inevitable. At first Clarke hedges his bets. \"It's good that we can get good quality food at a good price, isn't it?\" But that price is going to go up, I say, again. He hesitates. \"I'm thinking.\" He stares away out of the window in silence. Then he says: \"Because of growing global demand, it is going to change. There's going to be more demand and more pressure. Over the long term I think food prices and peoples' proportion of income may well be going up but we'll be doing our bit. Unless more food is produced prices must go up. It's the basic law of supply and demand.\" It feels like a moment of confession. The boss of Tesco has finally said the unsayable. Peter Kendall, president of the NFU, acknowledges that Clarke's heart is in the right place. He also says that Tesco has already done good things, especially in paying dairy farmers more for milk. \"But I think the company is an unwieldy tanker to turn around. How does he convince the whole of Tesco?\" Others in the food industry make the same point, with one senior executive describing Tesco's buyers to me as \"hardnosed\" and \"aggressive\" people whose basic starting point is that all suppliers \"are liars\". Clarke accepts that in an organisation like his there may be people like that, but insists that cultures do change. \"It starts with the leadership. For years we've been working hard with our buyers and we continue to do so.\" That also means getting them to understand that price isn't everything. \"They need to manage their categories in a more rounded way.\" Does he worry that some of Tesco's fanfared initiatives to get people to waste less food and eat more healthily were thin on detail? \"They did lack detail. But sometimes it's great to have an ambition and then work out how to achieve it.\" He promises there will be terrific announcements to come. I say we will have to take his word for it. What, though, about all the emphasis on what consumers can do to cut down on waste? Where were the announcements on what Tesco would do to cut down on waste in its supply chain? Over-ordered crops have ended up being ploughed back in to the fields when Tesco suddenly decided it didn't need them. \"There will have to be an end to that,\" Clarke says simply. They will, he says, have to be better at forecasting their needs. And where they have ordered too much they will have to take responsibility \"for selling them on the open market for a lower price than we contracted to pay\". What about buy one get one free deals \u2013 bogofs \u2013 which are seen as responsible for people buying more than they need? \"Customers don't like them as much they used to,\" Clarke says. \"They'd prefer to get a cheaper product than get one for free.\" And the deals and bogofs on unhealthy foods? \"I have a responsibility to give customers choice. But we were the first supermarket to move confectionery away from the tills.\" Our time is up. We head around the corner to a Tesco Metro on Regent Street for photographs. Suddenly he is retailer-in-chief. He wants me to see the takeaway salad bar which, he says, is a \"huge hit\", talks enthusiastically about the individually wrapped sushi, which is his own lunch of choice, a hangover from his days working for Tesco in Japan. As I herd him up the aisles towards the photographer, he keeps stopping to point out the great value of a BLT sandwich here, a chicken sandwich there. And that's the point. Supermarkets are price-sensitive businesses. Can Clarke really deliver a change in the way Tesco deals with its farmers, given those massive pressures? We have to hope so. In the long term, Britain's access to affordable food depends upon it.",

      "bodyText": "Major food price rises are all but inevitable, the chief executive of Britain's biggest supermarket chain has admitted. Speaking exclusively to the Observer, Philip Clarke of Tesco, which was heavily implicated in the horsemeat scandal, said that rising global demand means the historic low prices to which British consumers have become used are now unsustainable. \"Over the long run I think food prices and the proportion of income spent on food may well be going up,\" he said. \"Because of growing demand it is going to change. It is the basic law of supply and demand.\" The admission comes as a new poll, commissioned by the Prince's Countryside Fund to mark National Countryside Week beginning tomorrow, reveals that a majority of British consumers would be prepared to pay more for food if they knew the extra was going to farmers rather than to supermarket shareholders. The YouGov poll also indicates that more than 80% of consumers think it is important to buy British produce where possible as a way of showing support for the nation's farmers. \"The British public care deeply about British agriculture and are prepared to support British farmers, even if that means paying more for food, provided that extra money returns directly to the producer,\" said Donald Curry, a trustee of the Prince's Countryside Fund, which was founded by the Prince of Wales in 2010 to support struggling farmers and the rural way of life. \"Farmers play a vital and important role not just to the rural economy but in managing the countryside.\" The United Nations Food and Agriculture Organisation forecast last month that global food prices could rise by as much as 40% over the next decade, as a result of a growing middle class in countries such as China and India. However, Britain's supermarket bosses have proved extremely resistant to admitting economic pressures would affect the cost of groceries shopping. Previously only Mark Price, chief executive of Waitrose, has broken ranks by admitting food price inflation is inevitable, although his affluent customer base is regarded as being less price sensitive. Last month food price inflation rose slightly from 2.4% in May to 2.7% in June. In February, Philip Clarke told a conference of the National Farmers Union that Tesco would source more of its produce from Britain and give better deals to farmers, in an attempt to restore trust in the brand following the discovery of horsemeat in four of the supermarket's beef products. At the time he insisted the initiatives did not mean \"that food needs to become more expensive\". However, during the Observer's interview he admitted that while price is important \"it's not everything. We're working very hard with our buyers so they're not just focused on price.\" In a wide-ranging interview Clarke confessed that, in the wake of both the horsemeat scandal and a slump in pre-tax profits by more than 50%, the retailing giant, which has a 30% share of the food market, had still to regain the public's trust. Its own research revealed that the public thought \"Tesco was big and Tesco was bad\". He said the company, which employs 325,000 people in the UK and has a global turnover of nearly \u00a375bn, is determined to do all it can to keep food price rises in check, by giving farmers better contracts so they can invest in the agricultural base. \"We've got to produce more food at home and we've got to make better deals with producers,\" he said.",

However, during the <em>Observer</em>'s interview he admitted that while price is important \"it's not everything. We're working very hard with our buyers so they're not just focused on price.\"</p> <p>In a wide-ranging interview Clarke confessed that, in the wake of both the horsemeat scandal and a slump in pre-tax profits by more than 50%, the retailing giant, which has a 30% share of the food market, had still to regain the public's trust. Its own research revealed that the public thought \"Tesco was big and Tesco was bad\".</p> <p>He said the company, which employs 325,000 people in the UK and has a global turnover of nearly \u00a375bn, is determined to do all it can to keep food price rises in check, by giving farmers better contracts so they can invest in the agricultural base. \"We've got to produce more food at home and we've got to make better deals with producers,\" he said.</p>",

    "webTitle": "We need more new homes \u2013 but not more home ownership", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Ever since Margaret Thatcher gave council tenants the Right to Buy in 1980, it has become a deeply-held tenet in British politics that boosting home ownership is a good thing. It's aspirational, it gives people a stake in society \u2013 and it makes voters feel warm inside about the government of the day. Yet, after more than two decades of politicians encouraging Brits to take the plunge and invest in a roof of their own \u2013 and freeing the banks to lend to them \u2013 the result is a deeply divided society. Those lucky enough to get the proverbial foot on the ladder 30 \u2013 or even just 10 \u2013 years ago have accumulated a comfortable cushion of wealth; today's twentysomethings are shut out. This \"Generation Rent\" is trapped in often poor-quality accommodation, on insecure tenancies, with little prospect of buying a home unless they're prepared to borrow (and someone is prepared to lend them) a positively terrifying multiple of their income. But even aside from the gulf between the haves and the have-nots in our property-owning democracy, there is intriguing and alarming new evidence that, in economic terms, a high level of home ownership may not in itself be a good thing \u2013 indeed, quite the reverse. In a research paper for the Peterson Institute for International Economics, based on data across US states over time, David Blanchflower and Andrew Oswald find that areas with higher home ownership tend to have higher unemployment. The effect is large: over time, a doubling of the rate of owner-occupation is eventually followed by more than a doubling of the unemployment rate \u2013 and similar results were found in a separate study on Finland. It's not yet clear exactly how the relationship between home ownership and unemployment might work, but the authors speculate that in states with higher levels of owner-occupation, it may be harder for people to move rapidly into jobs in new areas \u2013 a flexibility that can be crucial as the labour market changes. It's not that homeowners are more likely to be unemployed, in other words, but that their prevalence may lead to less fluid, more rigid societies. Blanchflower and Oswald add that those areas with high home ownership also tended to have lower rates of business formation \u2013 perhaps suggesting, they say, that the power of nimbyism makes it harder for firms to set up and grow, and for economies to change over time. In the UK, where economic activity has been heavily concentrated in London and the south-east since the long decline of the industrial heartlands of the north, the extreme price gap between properties in the capital and elsewhere means that the stultifying effect of owner-occupation is likely to be even greater. The latest Nationwide data suggests that the average London house price is now an extraordinary 90% higher than the average in the rest of the UK \u2013 the highest premium since its records began in the mid-1970s. How can someone living in Blackburn, where the average house price is less than \u00a375,000, possibly hope to relocate to the capital, where it's \u00a3375,000? The divisions created by Britain's topsy-turvy housing market are depressingly familiar; but when the credit crisis brought the long upward run of prices to a shuddering halt, it looked as though times were set to change. Many analysts expected that after a sharp decline of at least 10% in most places, and closer to 20% in some, prices might move sideways for a long period, while sluggish wages caught up. Yet the coalition appears to be doing everything it can to stoke a revival of the mad markets that spawned such televisual gems as Property Ladder and Location, Location, Location. There is already evidence the Funding for Lending scheme, a radical attempt to get banks lending again, launched a year ago, has unblocked mortgage loans and helped to get the housing market moving (while doing little for cash-strapped small businesses, which are still seeing net lending decline). But, not content with that, the chancellor has introduced the new, potentially more radical Help to Buy scheme, the first part of which is already in operation, offering interest-free loans to the purchasers of newbuild properties. The details of the second part of Help to Buy \u2013 a taxpayer-backed mortgage guarantee \u2013 are not yet available, and it will not be launched until the new year; but it is expected to underpin up to \u00a3130bn of new lending. Yet Blanchflower and Oswald's findings, when put together with the social schism between the property-owning classes and those left behind, raise profound questions about whether boosting home ownership is a sensible goal for public policy. Many critics of the Help to Buy scheme, including homelessness charity Shelter, have argued that the government should focus on direct investment in building the hundreds of thousands of new homes needed to contain house price inflation. But the idea that widespread home ownership brings with it social disadvantages would suggest other, even more radical policies too: not least taxing housing wealth more heavily; intervening to ensure that rental markets are well regulated; and perhaps deliberately encouraging the inclusion of rental properties as part of new housing developments. Stoking a new state-backed wave of housing demand through Help to Buy certainly can't be the answer. A nation of gazumpers, estate agency window-shoppers and buy-to-let speculators is not a healthy economy.",

      "body": "<p>Ever since Margaret Thatcher gave council tenants the Right to Buy in 1980, it has become a deeply-held tenet in British politics that boosting home ownership is a good thing. It's aspirational, it gives people a stake in society \u2013 and it makes voters feel warm inside about the government of the day.</p> <p>Yet, after more than two decades of politicians encouraging Brits to take the plunge and invest in a roof of their own \u2013 and freeing the banks to lend to them \u2013 the result is a deeply divided society. Those lucky enough to get the proverbial foot on the ladder 30 \u2013 or even just 10 \u2013 years ago have accumulated a comfortable cushion of wealth; today's twentysomethings are shut out.</p> <p>This \"Generation Rent\" is trapped in often poor-quality accommodation, on insecure tenancies, with little prospect of buying a home unless they're prepared to borrow (and someone is prepared to lend them) a positively terrifying multiple of their income.</p> <p>But even aside from the gulf between the haves and the have-nots in our property-owning democracy, there is intriguing and alarming new evidence that, in economic terms, a high level of home ownership may not in itself be a good thing \u2013 indeed, quite the reverse.</p> <p>In a <a href=\"http://www.piie.com/publications/wp/wp13-3.pdf\" title=\"\">research paper for the Peterson Institute for International Economics</a>, based on data across US states over time, David Blanchflower and Andrew Oswald find that areas with higher home ownership tend to have higher unemployment. The effect is large: over time, a doubling of the rate of owner-occupation is eventually followed by more than a doubling of the unemployment rate \u2013 and similar results were found in a separate study on Finland.</p> <p>It's not yet clear exactly how the relationship between home ownership and unemployment might work, but the authors speculate that in states with higher levels of owner-occupation, it may be harder for people to move rapidly into jobs in new areas \u2013 a flexibility that can be crucial as the labour market changes. It's not that homeowners are more likely to be unemployed, in other words, but that their prevalence may lead to less fluid, more rigid societies.</p> <p>Blanchflower and Oswald add that those areas with high home ownership also tended to have lower rates of business formation \u2013 perhaps suggesting, they say, that the power of nimbyism makes it harder for firms to set up and grow, and for economies to change over time.</p> <p>In the UK, where economic activity has been heavily concentrated in London and the south-east since the long decline of the industrial heartlands of the north, the extreme price gap between properties in the capital and elsewhere means that the stultifying effect of owner-occupation is likely to be even greater.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.nationwide.co.uk/NR/rdonlyres/D3271389-0282-451B-ABFD-E660117DAC31/0/Jun_2013.pdf\" title=\"\">latest Nationwide data</a> suggests that the average London house price is now an extraordinary 90% higher than the average in the rest of the UK \u2013 the highest premium since its records began in the mid-1970s. How can someone living in Blackburn, where the average house price is less than \u00a375,000, possibly hope to relocate to the capital, where it's \u00a3375,000?</p> <p>The divisions created by Britain's topsy-turvy housing market are depressingly familiar; but when the credit crisis brought the long upward run of prices to a shuddering halt, it looked as though times were set to change. Many analysts expected that after a sharp decline of at least 10% in most places, and closer to 20% in some, prices might move sideways for a long period, while sluggish wages caught up.</p> <p>Yet the coalition appears to be doing everything it can to stoke a revival of the mad markets that spawned such televisual gems as <em>Property Ladder</em> and <em>Location, Location, Location</em>.</p> <p>There is already evidence the Funding for Lending scheme, a radical attempt to get banks lending again, launched a year ago, has unblocked mortgage loans and helped to get the housing market moving (while doing little for cash-strapped small businesses, which are still seeing net lending decline).</p> <p>But, not content with that, the chancellor has introduced the new, potentially more radical Help to Buy scheme, the first part of which is already in operation, offering interest-free loans to the purchasers of newbuild properties. The details of the second part of Help to Buy \u2013 a taxpayer-backed mortgage guarantee \u2013 are not yet available, and it will not be launched until the new year; but it is expected to underpin up to \u00a3130bn of new lending.</p> <p>Yet Blanchflower and Oswald's findings, when put together with the social schism between the property-owning classes and those left behind, raise profound questions about whether boosting home ownership is a sensible goal for public policy.</p> <p>Many critics of the Help to Buy scheme, including homelessness charity Shelter, have argued that the government should focus on direct investment in building the hundreds of thousands of new homes needed to contain house price inflation.</p> <p>But the idea that widespread home ownership brings with it social disadvantages would suggest other, even more radical policies too: not least taxing housing wealth more heavily; intervening to ensure that rental markets are well regulated; and perhaps deliberately encouraging the inclusion of rental properties as part of new housing developments.</p> <p>Stoking a new state-backed wave of housing demand through Help to Buy certainly can't be the answer. A nation of gazumpers, estate agency window-shoppers and buy-to-let speculators is not a healthy economy.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Claims that vulnerable asylum seekers have been evicted from their homes after failures by contractors working for G4S, the world's biggest private security firm, are to be investigated by a parliamentary watchdog. At least three women are alleged to have been expelled from properties because of rent arrears that had arisen because G4S subcontractors had not paid landlords. The allegations have been forwarded to public spending watchdog the National Audit Office (NAO), which now plans to look into arrangements for asylum accommodation. Last year G4S, which had no previous experience of providing social housing, was awarded a \u00a3324m slice of a seven-year \u00a3620m UK Border Agency contract to provide housing for asylum seekers. However, concerns that a security company rather than a social housing association had secured the contract prompted warnings that the firm would be ill-equipped to handle it. A letter from Margaret Hodge, chair of the public accounts committee, seen by the Observer, admits that the Home Office \"is aware of general concerns around the contracts in operation\" and that a review into asylum accommodation by the NAO will form part of a wider look at the delivery of public services by private sector contractors, including G4S. Failures that mean already vulnerable individuals face increased insecurity have infuriated campaigners.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Row upon row of Range Rovers and Minis gleam in the afternoon sun in the yards around Southampton docks, waiting to be driven on to huge cargo ships that will carry them to car-hungry emerging economies. From his office, port director Doug Morrison can see the towering cruise ships being loaded before they cast off for Mediterranean and Caribbean holidays. Alongside stands a ship awaiting a cargo of new cars, which arrive on the dockside on dedicated trains from manufacturers in the Midlands. Further along are container ships bringing TVs and clothes from the far east and a vast array of goods to stock Britain's shops. \"Two years ago there were 500,000 imports and exports of new cars here. This year it is 750,000 and I am pleased to say 65% of that is exports. They are from Jaguar Land Rover, Honda and there are Mini Coopers. Much of that growth is coming from Jaguar Land Rover sales to the far east,\" says Morrison. This picture of a thriving British export sector is exactly the one the coalition will be hoping to project on Thursday, if, as experts expect, the latest GDP figures show the economy expanded at a healthy clip in the second quarter of 2013. Analysts predict a growth rate of around 0.6%, perhaps even 0.8%, which would represent a marked strengthening of the recovery \u2013 good news for a coalition keen to seize on signs that the economy has moved \"out of intensive care\", as chancellor George Osborne puts it. \"We have a great economic barometer here. We can really see what is happening,\" says Morrison, who has run the docks for Associated British Ports since 2005. He talks about the \"three C's\" \u2013 cars, cruises and containers \u2013 and all point to an upturn, albeit with choppy seas ahead. \"The cruise business continues to be very strong,\" he says. Famous in the past as the port from which Titanic set sail on its ill-fated maiden voyage, Southampton now sees 1.6 million passengers embark and disembark from cruise ships every year. Less than a decade ago only a third as many were passing through the port. But Morrison adds that the number of containers being landed has not risen \u2013 the lack of growth in consumer imports evidence of tough times on Britain's high streets. \"When you look at what the likes of Tesco and Argos are saying, it's not surprising that you are not seeing any real growth in containers.\" It is not only at the dockside that things are looking up, four years on from the depths of the recession. Jan Ward, chief executive and founder of specialist metals distributor Corrotherm International, based on an industrial estate on the edge of the city, says she is \"overwhelmed with work\". \"These have been the best five years we have had,\" says Ward, who started the company in 1992. On the back of strong demand for the nickel alloy parts the company supplies to the oil and gas industry, turnover grew 46% over the last year to \u00a321m and Ward expects it to double this year. Corrotherm has recently opened offices in Abu Dhabi, Saudi Arabia, Korea and Perth in Australia and is about to open one in China. Ward, an active member of the local chamber of commerce, believes the government's push for what the chancellor has called a \"march of the makers\" is finally starting to yield results. \"All the signs that I see are very, very good. Finally, these messages are starting to get through to manufacturers and people who are looking to start businesses up. For the manufacturing sector things are looking very bright.\" Despite her optimism, however, some economists are concerned that while a stronger GDP reading would undoubtedly be good news, there is so far little sign of the deep-seated shifts in the economy the government had hoped to bring about. Russell Jones of Llewellyn Consulting says: \"It looks like what is driving this is the consumer to a large degree, and you could argue that that's the wrong sort of growth.\" The housing market is starting to recover and retail spending is on the rise, but business investment in the first quarter of 2013 was more than 16% lower than a year earlier. Meanwhile the latest trade figures suggested that although exports are rising, so are imports, so that hopes of Britain becoming a new manufacturing powerhouse have so far proved over-optimistic. Simon Wells, UK economist at HSBC, says: \"Back in 2010, we were hoping the economy would rebalance in three ways: away from services and towards manufacturing; away from consumption and towards investment; and away from domestic demand and towards exports. Now it seems that for policymakers, any growth will do.\" The Bank of England and the Treasury had expected the sharp depreciation in sterling since 2008 to spark an export revival, as British goods became cheaper on world markets. But the transformation has been hampered, both because our major markets have been in crisis and our industrial sector is so hollowed out that an increase in exports brings in its wake a jump in imports too, as manufacturers buy raw materials and parts. At the same time, the decline in the pound has been one cause of the above-target inflation that has further hampered recovery by eating into workers' pay. Jones points out that with real incomes continuing to fall, in what the TUC has described as the longest squeeze on wages since the late 19th century, any rise in consumption is being driven by \"people dipping into their savings\". There is certainly evidence in Southampton that the long-stalled property market is beginning to revive. Lisa Martin-Pope, who works in one of the many estate agents on the city's busy London Road, says: \"The biggest indicator at the moment is we are seeing more first-time buyers and seeing banks and building societies lending to them more readily.\" Her agency, Martin &amp; Co, is seeing homes selling more quickly, with the average buyer paying 93% of the asking price. Labour will argue on Thursday that the benefits of the nascent upturn have been pocketed by a limited number of people, including those in financial services. Chris Leslie, shadow financial secretary to the Treasury, says: \"Wages after inflation are now down by an average of \u00a31,300 since David Cameron got into Downing Street, yet bank bonuses soared to \u00a34bn in April as high earners took full advantage of the top-rate tax cut.\" From his window on the docks, Doug Morrison agrees that not everyone is reaping the rewards of recovery. \"The haves continue to spend and the have-nots cannot spend,\" he says. \"People are reluctant to give up their holidays, the haves are still buying cars, but the poor people out of work or not getting any pay rises are not buying their three-piece suites or buying new clothes as often.\" The haves are certainly in evidence at Southampton's Ocean Village marina, where shining white yachts are moored alongside motorboats. Luxury apartments overlook the water and in harbourside bars people sit around tables with glasses of chilled ros\u00e9 and beer. The only thing to spoil the idyllic summer scene is the sound of the jackhammers on the nearby construction site where a \u00a374m, 24-storey apartment block will become Southampton's tallest building. James King, of local boat and home broker Waterside Properties, says there is a \"cautious recovery\". But a short drive away from the marina, at Ford's soon-to-be-defunct Transit van plant, there's a powerful sense that not everyone is sharing in what Osborne calls the \"healing\" of recession-scarred Britain. Engineer Chris finds it hard to conceal his dismay at losing the job he has had for 28 years. \"It is devastating really. It's the end of an era. Anyone who has been here a long time is faced with a very empty shell of a plant. It is like a ghost town.\" Chris, 52, who preferred not to give his full name, is moving to a new job with Ford in Wales, but not all his colleagues have been so fortunate, he says. \"There's a lot of youngsters that have young families. We are closely knit.\" When the factory is mothballed on Friday it will mark the end of more than a century of Ford vehicle manufacturing in the UK and more than 40 years of making Transit vans in Southampton. Faced with a prolonged slump in demand across western Europe that has seen new vehicle sales drop to a 20-year low, Ford is moving much of its production to a cheaper base in Turkey. \"The atmosphere in there is one of shock and disbelief. People are walking around as if they don't know what's happened. People in there I've known for years, grown men, they have been in tears,\" says Chris. It remains to be seen if the long-hoped-for recovery that seems to be taking root will blossom as the year goes on, perhaps bringing with it the greater confidence for firms, and new jobs and pay rises for their staff, that would help to spread its benefits. Until that happens, most analysts will continue to be sceptical. \"I'm still quite cautious about growth,\" says Wells of HSBC. \"There must be a limit to how much we can grow when real, post-inflation wages are falling.\"",

Corrotherm has recently opened offices in Abu Dhabi, Saudi Arabia, Korea and Perth in Australia and is about to open one in China.</p> <p>Ward, an active member of the local chamber of commerce, believes the government's push for what the chancellor has called a \"march of the makers\" is finally starting to yield results. \"All the signs that I see are very, very good. Finally, these messages are starting to get through to manufacturers and people who are looking to start businesses up. For the manufacturing sector things are looking very bright.\"</p> <p>Despite her optimism, however, some economists are concerned that while a stronger GDP reading would undoubtedly be good news, there is so far little sign of the deep-seated shifts in the economy the government had hoped to bring about. Russell Jones of Llewellyn Consulting says: \"It looks like what is driving this is the consumer to a large degree, and you could argue that that's the wrong sort of growth.\"</p> <p>The housing market is starting to recover and retail spending is on the rise, but business investment in the first quarter of 2013 was more than 16% lower than a year earlier. Meanwhile <a href=\"http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/dcp171778_314979.pdf\" title=\"\">the latest trade figures</a> suggested that although exports are rising, so are imports, so that hopes of Britain becoming a new manufacturing powerhouse have so far proved over-optimistic.</p> <p>Simon Wells, UK economist at HSBC, says: \"Back in 2010, we were hoping the economy would rebalance in three ways: away from services and towards manufacturing; away from consumption and towards investment; and away from domestic demand and towards exports. Now it seems that for policymakers, any growth will do.\"</p> <p>The Bank of England and the Treasury had expected the sharp depreciation in sterling since 2008 to spark an export revival, as British goods became cheaper on world markets. But the transformation has been hampered, both because our major markets have been in crisis and our industrial sector is so hollowed out that an increase in exports brings in its wake a jump in imports too, as manufacturers buy raw materials and parts.</p> <p>At the same time, the decline in the pound has been one cause of the above-target inflation that has further hampered recovery by eating into workers' pay. Jones points out that with real incomes continuing to fall, in what the TUC has described as the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/jul/16/uk-workers-wage-squeeze-longest-since-1870s\" title=\"\">longest squeeze on wages since the late 19th century</a>, any rise in consumption is being driven by \"people dipping into their&#xa0;savings\".</p> <p>There is certainly evidence in Southampton that the long-stalled property market is beginning to revive. Lisa Martin-Pope, who works in one of the many estate agents on the city's busy London Road, says: \"The biggest indicator at the moment is we are seeing more first-time buyers and seeing banks and building societies lending to them more readily.\" Her agency, Martin &amp; Co, is seeing homes selling more quickly, with the average buyer paying 93% of the asking price.</p> <p>Labour will argue on Thursday that the benefits of the nascent upturn have been pocketed by a limited number of people, including those in financial services. Chris Leslie, shadow financial secretary to the Treasury, says: \"Wages after inflation are now down by an average of \u00a31,300 since David Cameron got into Downing Street, yet bank bonuses soared to \u00a34bn in April as high earners took full advantage of the top-rate tax cut.\"</p> <p>From his window on the docks, Doug Morrison agrees that not everyone is reaping the rewards of recovery. \"The haves continue to spend and the have-nots cannot spend,\" he says. \"People are reluctant to give up their holidays, the haves are still buying cars, but the poor people out of work or not getting any pay rises are not buying their three-piece suites or buying new clothes as often.\"</p> <p>The haves are certainly in evidence at Southampton's Ocean Village marina, where shining white yachts are moored alongside motorboats. Luxury apartments overlook the water and in harbourside bars people sit around tables with glasses of chilled ros\u00e9 and beer.</p> <p>The only thing to spoil the idyllic summer scene is the sound of the jackhammers on the nearby construction site where a \u00a374m, 24-storey apartment block will become Southampton's tallest building. James King, of local boat and home broker Waterside Properties, says there is a \"cautious recovery\".</p> <p>But a short drive away from the marina, at Ford's soon-to-be-defunct Transit van plant, there's a powerful sense that not everyone is sharing in what Osborne calls the \"healing\" of recession-scarred Britain.</p> <p>Engineer Chris finds it hard to conceal his dismay at losing the job he has had for 28 years. \"It is devastating really. It's the end of an era. Anyone who has been here a long time is faced with a very empty shell of a plant. It is like a ghost town.\"</p> <p>Chris, 52, who preferred not to give his full name, is moving to a new job with Ford in Wales, but not all his colleagues have been so fortunate, he says. \"There's a lot of youngsters that have young families. We are closely knit.\"</p> <p>When the factory is mothballed on Friday it will mark the end of more than a century of Ford vehicle manufacturing in the UK and more than 40 years of making Transit vans in Southampton. Faced with a prolonged slump in demand across western Europe that has seen new vehicle sales drop to a 20-year low, Ford is moving much of its production to a cheaper base in Turkey.</p> <p>\"The atmosphere in there is one of shock and disbelief. People are walking around as if they don't know what's happened. People in there I've known for years, grown men, they have been in tears,\" says Chris.</p> <p>It remains to be seen if the long-hoped-for recovery that seems to be taking root will blossom as the year goes on, perhaps bringing with it the greater confidence for firms, and new jobs and pay rises for their staff, that would help to spread its benefits. Until that happens, most analysts will continue to be sceptical. \"I'm still quite cautious about growth,\" says Wells of HSBC. \"There must be a limit to how much we can grow when real, post-inflation wages are falling.\"</p>",
