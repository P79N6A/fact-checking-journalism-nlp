      "bodyText": "Entry-level jobs are disappearing from the Australian labour market, and five entry-level workers are now competing for each advertised job, a report has found. The findings prompted Anglicare Australia\u2019s deputy director, Roland Manderson, to call on the government to stop making scapegoats of the unemployed. \u201cBasically we\u2019re talking about a whole mob of people who are excluded from the workforce, who have really little chance of getting work. And yet they\u2019re blamed for their unemployment,\u201d Manderson said. \u201cWe\u2019re blaming people for their circumstances, and I think we do it to avoid blaming ourselves.\u201d Anglicare released its jobs availability snapshot on Thursday, which examined jobs advertised and unemployment figures from the sample month, May 2017. It found there were 124,000 jobseekers who were only qualified for entry-level jobs. Those jobseekers were competing for 25,979 entry-level jobs advertised, the report found. The number of entry-level jobs was also falling. In 2006 about 22% of advertised jobs were entry-level. This year, it was 15%. Anglicare\u2019s report also warned of the worsening security of work. The number of underemployed Australians rose from 875,200 last year to 1.1 million this year. More broadly, there were 711,900 unemployed competing for a total of 171,544 advertised jobs in May. The report comes as the government pushes ahead with significant changes to the welfare system. The changes includes drug testing of welfare recipients, a new demerit point system for the failure to meet mutual obligations, and cuts to a bereavement allowance that could leave families $1,300 worse off. Wife pension payments will also be abolished for about 200 women living overseas and the government plans to remove \u201cintent to claim provisions\u201d, which protect people who are entitled to welfare but are unable to lodge a full claim due to personal circumstances. The Anglicare report recommended raising Newstart and Youth Allowance rates, dismantling the \u201crigid\u201d system of mutual obligation and punishment, and identifying and supporting industries with entry-level jobs that are expected to expand, such as aged care and disability. Anglicare\u2019s executive director, Kasy Chambers, said the job snapshot showed punishing welfare recipients was ineffective. \u201cThis shows that cracking down on welfare and forcing people to jump through hoops simply hasn\u2019t worked,\u201d she said. \u201cInstead of helping people find work, they are forced to compete for jobs that simply aren\u2019t there. \u201cBut there is hope, and opportunity. With the disability and aged-care sectors set to grow across Australia, we can create stable jobs and career pathways for those who need them. We can offer tailored support and training for those who need it. And we can redesign the support system so that it\u2019s a safety net \u2013 not a poverty trap.\u201d",

The third-quarter update delivered a second sales warning of the year. Like-for-like revenues will be flat in 2017, which hasn\u2019t happened in any year since the company was created in its current form in 1999. Chief executive, Rakesh Kapoor, can grumble about \u201ca continuing challenging market environment\u201d but Reckitt is also underperforming against its peers. In normal circumstances investors might shrug, remember the virtue of patience and trust Kapoor\u2019s long-term record. It\u2019s not an unreasonable view, but Reckitt has more on its plate these days. It is digesting its $18bn (\u00a313.6bn) purchase of Mead Johnson\u2019s baby milk unit, which was an un-Reckitt-like acquisition in two ways. First, the deal was much bigger than the bolt-ons that have served the company well. Second, it stretched the definition of \u201cconsumer healthcare\u201d and took Reckitt into direct competition with big beasts like Nestl\u00e9 and Danone in the race to flog baby milk in China. It\u2019s too late to look back. Indeed, the arrival of the Mead has prompted a big corporate rejig. Reckitt will have two divisions in future. Health will take in brands like Nurofen, Strepsils, Gaviscon, Durex plus the baby milk. Hygiene and home will have Cillit Bang, Vanish, Harpic and so on. The overhaul inevitably set hares racing. Are all those home cleaning products, the worst performing bit of Reckitt, being lined up for a sale one day? Or is Reckitt, post-Mead, now so sprawling that it needs to be subdivided to make it more manageable? And is that the real source of its soggy sales line? Old Reckitt was easy to understand \u2013 it was a marketing machine that ran a lean shop. Now it has bet the future on the highly-priced Mead deal and says the new corporate structure implies \u201csomewhat higher fixed costs\u201d. Doubts will disappear if Reckitt returns to form in 2018. For the time being, however, scepticism is right stance. Rio dances between regulators Rio Tinto\u2019s $3.7bn purchase in 2011 of some coal mines in Mozambique has a fair claim to being the worst deal done by a large mining company in recent decades. Events turned farcical almost from the off. Rio discovered its plan to ship the coal down the Zambezi river to a port on the Indian Ocean was a non-starter because the Mozambique government wouldn\u2019t grant the permits. Meanwhile, the quality of the coking coal turned out to be poor and the quantities smaller than assumed. Rio eventually sold the assets for the miserable sum of $50m in 2014, by which time chief executive Tom Albanese had understandably lost his job. But here\u2019s the new \u2013 and very odd \u2013 part of the story. Two financial regulators in two countries have looked at how and, critically, when Rio revealed its woes in Mozambique to investors and have taken very different actions. The US Securities &amp; Exchange Commission (SEC) is bringing civil fraud charges against Rio, Albanese and Guy Elliott, the chief financial officer at the time. The SEC says there were \u201ca series of misrepresentations, misleading omissions, and deceptive acts\u201d over a period of 14 months from November 2011. The company and two former directors deny the charges. Our own Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), however, thinks Rio alone merely displayed \u201ca serious lack of judgment\u201d in failing to write down the value of the assets promptly. The deed should have been done with half-results in August 2012; it actually happened the following January. Rio has accepted a \u00a327m penalty from the FCA for breaching disclosure rules and the case has been closed with no action taken against Albanese or Elliott. Neither the FCA nor the SEC is obliged to explain the different stances. They are independent regulators and are free to do their own thing. All the same, one of them is going to look foolish. If the SEC fails in its action, it will have to explain why it took such a heavy approach with a UK-headquartered company with its primary listing in London. If, on the other hand, the SEC succeeds in its action against individuals, the FCA will look like a regulatory poodle. It has to be one or the other. Supermarkets swallow inflation problems One supermarket executive confided at the start of this year that food inflation would have to be running at 5% by the autumn, to reflect the lower pound, otherwise the sector would be awash with profits warnings. Well, autumn has arrived but food inflation hasn\u2019t hit 5% \u2013 it was 3.1% on the latest readings. But there have been no profits warnings. Instead, there are job losses. The 2,000 at Sainsbury\u2019s add to 2,300 at Tesco. Sadly, there was an air of inevitability about both.",

    "webTitle": "Real wages fall despite low levels of unemployment", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The lowest levels of unemployment since the mid-70s are still failing to boost the bargaining power of workers in the UK, as official figures show Britain\u2019s pay squeeze entered its sixth month. Average earnings excluding bonuses increased by 2.1% in the three months to August, down from 2.2% in the three months to July after a revision to the earlier figures, according to the Office for National Statistics. City economists had forecast growth of 2%. When taking account of inflation, the ONS said real wages fell by 0.4% on the previous year, despite the unemployment rate remaining steady at 4.3% \u2013 the joint lowest level since 1975. The figures ignited a political row in Westminster as the Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, attacked Theresa May\u2019s stewardship of the economy. Speaking at prime ministers\u2019 questions in parliament on Wednesday, he said: \u201cFigures show that real wages are lower today than they were 10 years ago. Most people in work are worse off.\u201d The prime minister said tax cuts and the national living wage was helping with the cost of living for households, while it was good news that the unemployment rate was at its lowest level for more than 40 years. \u201cThat does mean more money being taken in wages to their families,\u201d she said. The figures will perplex the Bank of England as it prepares for the first interest rate hike in a decade from as early as next month. The central bank has been looking for signs of pay growth as it seeks to balance a trade-off between supporting jobs and the economy with low rates and cutting the growth in prices. Howard Archer, chief economic adviser to the EY Item Club, said the data \u201cfails to provide a decisive case\u201d for the Bank to increase the cost of borrowing from 0.25%. \u201cThe squeeze on consumers remains appreciable, with obvious negative implications for personal expenditure,\u201d he said. The latest fall in real pay means that average earnings are no higher than they were in February 2006, despite the economy being 4.4% bigger per person than at that time, according to the Resolution Foundation. Stephen Clarke, an economic analyst at the thinktank, said: \u201cToday\u2019s figures confirm the big picture trend that the UK labour market is great at creating jobs, but terrible at raising people\u2019s pay.\u201d There were some positive signs for Threadneedle Street to seize upon should it look to raise rates at the next meeting of its monetary policy committee in two weeks. The number of people in work increased by 94,000 in the three months to August 2017 compared with three months ago, although that was at a slower rate than in the previous three months to July. Of the increase in people entering the workforce, 78,000 were women. The total number of people employed full-time increased by 25,000 to 23.56 million, while the number of workers on part-time contracts rose by 69,000 to 8.55 million. Economists believe the Bank will probably raise rates even with lacklustre readings on the economy \u2013 barring any significant reverse \u2013 given the strength of its message in September signalling a desire for a rate increase in the \u201ccoming months\u201d. Matt Hughes, a senior ONS statistician, said: \u201cMany labour market measures continue to strengthen. Employment growth in the latest three-month period was driven mainly by women, with a corresponding drop in inactivity. Vacancies remain robust, at a near-record level.\u201d The sluggish pay growth comes as inflation reached its highest level in half a decade in September, fuelled by the drop in the pound since the Brexit vote a year ago. The consumer price index reached 3% last month, while the Bank\u2019s governor, Mark Carney, said on Tuesday he expects prices to rise further still. The Institute of Directors, which represents company bosses, blamed uncertainty over Brexit as well as the higher cost of goods used by firms for making it difficult for them to offer better pay packages. Firms have been avoiding investment due to fears over the lack of progress in talks between ministers and Brussels. Seamus Nevin, head of policy research at the lobby group, said: \u201cThis is leaving employers little wiggle room to offer inflation-busting pay increases.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The Reserve Bank assistant governor Luci Ellis this week suggested lowering the company tax rate was not as important for driving investment as is argued by the government and business groups. It brought into sharp relief how talk about the need to cut company tax rates is based on a pretty simplistic view of why our investment has fallen and what we can do to improve it. I think we sometimes forget just how massive the mining investment boom was. From the depth of the 1990s recession to 2004, mining investment grew by an average of 8.7% each year; but from 2005 through to the end of 2012 it grew by 32.4% each year: Such was the size of the boom that even with the recent falls, total new capital expenditure has us still tracking above where we would have expected to be, had the trend from 1992 to 2004 held: The boom was so large the iron ore industry grew from an equivalent of 0.75% of Australia\u2019s GDP to 2.7%: And while various governments like to take the credit and pass the blame for the boom and its end, overwhelmingly it occurred because of factors outside our control \u2013 namely China\u2019s entry into the world economy at the end of 2001 and the subsequent surge in iron ore prices. So it actually should not be that surprising to hear Ellis on Tuesday tell the Citi Australia and New Zealand Investment Conference that the level of the company tax rate was not as important a driver of investment as was argued by the head of the Business Council of Australia, Jennifer Westacott, on the same panel. Ellis said about the 10-year phase of the \u201cincredible\u201d investment mining boom: \u201cGuess what \u2013 multinational resource companies are not going to put that investment in a country which doesn\u2019t have those resources just because they have a lower tax rate.\u201d She noted that they \u201cwill invest where the LNG and the iron ore and the coal and \u2013 as it turns out \u2013 the lithium actually are\u201d. Ellis concluded that \u201cthe real reason we attract foreign capital rather than rely on foreign capital is precisely because we have these resources that are available and they aren\u2019t going anywhere.\u201d This of course is in stark opposition to the position put forward by the Business Council of Australia and the government, which remains determined to cut the company tax rate from 30% to 25% \u2013 citing moves by other nations and proposals by Donald Trump to cut the US company tax rate. The issue is that the 30% rate is one of the highest in the OECD \u2013 only the US, France, Belgium and Germany have higher rates than our 30%. And yet as Ellis and other commentators such as the ABC\u2019s Ian Verrender have noted, would that it were so easy to just think cutting the tax rate will spur investment. The most obvious problem is that given our dividend imputation system, changing the company tax rate doesn\u2019t have much of an impact for Australian investors as Australians get a credit against the amount of company tax they pay. As Ellis noted, this means from the perspective of the domestic investor \u201cthe corporate tax rate is irrelevant\u201d. It also means any benefit from lowering the company tax rate effectively goes to foreign investors. Now that is not necessarily a bad thing \u2013 but it depends on the type of investment that is being driven and also whether a lower tax rate would actually do much except lower the amount of revenue collected by the government. Ellis had broached this topic in February before the parliamentary economics committee. She told the committee then that what we need to think about is \u201cwhat is the nature of the investment that we are getting from foreign investors and how much of it is foreign direct investment, which builds new things versus, say, purchasing of existing securities or purchasing of existing assets?\u201d So even if we assume that a lower company tax rate will bring in foreign investment we can\u2019t just assume the type of investment is going to automatically drive economic growth and employment. Foreign direct investment is the type we are really after \u2013 where a foreign company sets up shop in Australia, employs people, builds factories and invests in equipment. But the company tax rate is just one of very many other considerations that drive that investment \u2013 considerations that include location of resources (both natural and people), regulatory framework, security of investment, skills, macroeconomic conditions and stability of policy. On this front, having a long-term energy policy would be potentially more important than a possible lowering of the tax rate. And it is worth noting that just looking at the tax rate is a bit of a simplistic way of comparing taxation. This March the Congressional Budget Office, in response to Trump\u2019s proposal to slash the US tax rate, compared the corporate tax rates of the G20 nations. But instead of just looking at the nominal rate, it also looked at the average rate paid and the effective rate, which measures a corporation\u2019s tax burden on returns from an investment that is expected to earn just enough, after taxes, to attract investors. And on this score, against the biggest economies in the world, Australia is nowhere near the top: The desire to cut the company tax rate is founded on the belief that we are uncompetitive with other nations and that we need to do something to arrest the fall in investment. And yet when looking at the actualities of our company tax system, we are not a high-taxing nation, and overwhelmingly the fall in investment is due to the end of the mining boom, not because other nations have lowered their tax rates and taken investment away. As Ellis noted, \u201cI\u2019m not sure I buy the idea that we have a great drought of non-mining investment\u201d. Indeed the latest GDP figures have seen the third consecutive growth of new business investment, and Ellis saw \u201csome synergies\u201d with a pick-up in public infrastructure investment. But while we may not actually have as high a corporate tax rate as business groups might argue, we are much more reliant upon company tax revenue than other nations: This means that if we cut company tax, then we need to get that revenue from somewhere, or we need to cut spending to balance it out. And that\u2019s the ultimate problem of the desire to cut company tax rate \u2013 it is unlikely to lead to the benefits those proposing it insist will occur but it will reduce revenue \u2013 and that will need to be paid by someone. And as the Parliamentary Budget Office showed last week, right now that someone is people on middle incomes.",

      "bodyText": "An expert report has raised concerns about unjustified secrecy and poor value for money in privately financed projects in Scotland. The report by two senior economists says there is a pressing need for an inquiry into whether the fast-increasing use of private financing by Scottish ministries and their agencies is in the public interest. The latest Scottish government figures show that NHS executives, colleges, councils and transport agency officials have signed 42 contracts with private financiers and construction companies for projects including secondary schools, GP surgeries, a new blood transfusion service HQ and three motorway upgrades. Their construction cost a total of \u00a32.6bn but over their lifetime the projects will cost \u00a37.6bn due to maintenance contracts lasting from 25-30 years, management fees and interest of up to 11.3% on borrowing. The study by Jim and Margaret Cuthbert, who have advised the World Bank and the OECD on public sector finance, disputes the Scottish government\u2019s claims that the Scottish Futures Trust is efficient. The SFT is a quango that runs Scotland\u2019s equivalent of the private finance initiative \u2013 a funding method for public projects that became widespread under the Blair and Brown governments. The Cuthberts\u2019 report cites concerns that private lenders were given unduly generous deals by the SFT. Referring to a group of SFT projects launched as the hub initiative by the Scottish government, the study says: \u201cOn finance, [this] secrecy makes it impossible to tell whether the financing costs of hub projects are unduly high, but circumstantial evidence suggests that this is indeed the case.\u201d It adds: \u201cOverall, concerns like the above raise serious doubts about the extent to which the hub initiative is actually achieving value for money.\u201d The projects covered by the Cuthberts\u2019 report include new secondary schools that will cost taxpayers more than \u00a3100m each by the time their 25-year-long private contracts end, and a bypass around Aberdeen that will cost \u00a31.47bn over the next 30 years \u2013 a price that excludes tens of millions of pounds in additional spending by the councils involved. The Scottish government insists the SFT\u2019s model of private financing is better and more cost-effective than traditional private finance initiative schemes \u2013 where the private sector pays the upfront costs of construction and then is paid back over decades by the state \u2013 introduced by previous Tory and Labour governments in Scotland. Those will cost taxpayers \u00a322bn in high interest and maintenance charges, but include several schemes approved after Alex Salmond became first minister in May 2007. The Cuthberts say the Scottish government\u2019s claims need to be checked independently and point out that until now there has been no effective scrutiny or evaluation of these projects\u2019 value for money. The report, commissioned by Scottish Labour, says that despite the privacy surrounding SFT contracts, there is enough direct and circumstantial evidence to challenge claims they are value for money. It says there is evidence that the SFT gave private lenders generous deals, paying them interest at rates much higher than the Treasury\u2019s lender for public sector projects, the Public Works Loan Board. Very few of the companies designated as primary contractors or the banks lending them money were Scottish, which could undermine the country\u2019s economy and private sector, the report says. In addition to the 42 projects that are under way, there are dozens of smaller PFI-type projects still in the pipeline, expected to cost at least a further \u00a31bn overall. Audit Scotland, the public spending watchdog, has begun a formal inquiry into the SFT after it emerged that the quango made serious errors when it designed the new private financing models covered by the Cuthberts\u2019 report. The SFT\u2019s schemes breached European Union rules designed to prevent governments from claiming that public sector building projects were not government assets because they were built and owned by private firms. That meant the building costs of many PFI projects had to be added to the government\u2019s books. Investigations by the Guardian showed this error meant the Scottish government had to set aside about \u00a3932m to cover the building costs of five projects, including the Aberdeen bypass, three hospitals and the new blood transfusion headquarters. The financiers for one of those hospitals, in Dumfries, south-west Scotland, will earn \u00a337.5m in interest for \u00a324.2m in lending, at an interest rate of 11.3%. In a similar case involving a project to redevelop the Royal Edinburgh psychiatric hospital, the Guardian and the Ferret website have found that its backers are charging 10.75% in interest for part of the borrowing needed for the first phase of the project. The companies are involved in building, financing and maintaining it will earn \u00a3116m by 2042 on facilities that cost \u00a338m to build. The devolved government defended its programme, insisting the SFT had produced \u00a3924m in savings and benefits since it was launched, without specifying what those were. The SFT \u201cenable[s] investment in public projects in Scotland to be brought forward more quickly than would otherwise be available through our capital allocation and limited borrowing powers\u201d, a spokeswoman said. \u201cThey also balance future operational and maintenance risks between the public and private sector.\u201d She added that Holyrood was given six-monthly updates on SFT projects, the system had been endorsed as efficient and effective by the Scottish government\u2019s finance committee and had been given a \u201cclean bill of health\u201d by Audit Scotland, which has covered SFT projects in reports on general government spending.",

      "bodyText": "Shareholders in Lloyds Banking Group were \u201cmugged\u201d by the bank and five of its former directors during the takeover of HBOS in 2008, the high court has heard. On the first day of a case which is expected to require former Lloyds chairman Sir Victor Blank and ex-chief executive Eric Daniels to give evidence, the court heard the deal took place amid intervention from the then prime minister, Gordon Brown, to avoid nationalisation of HBOS in September 2008. The court was told that HBOS might not have been able to open its doors on Monday 29 September 2008 without the emergency loans that the shareholders bringing the claim argue were not properly disclosed at the time they voted through the takeover in November 2008. Lloyds and five former directors \u2013 including Blank and Daniels \u2013 are contesting the case brought by almost 6,000 private investors who claim they were not provided with the full details about the financial health of HBOS nine years ago. Richard Hill QC, acting for the shareholders, told the court on Wednesday that HBOS had been \u201cfacing catastrophe\u201d and that Lloyds had been told the rival bank would have had to be nationalised if it did not agree to step in, just days after Lehman Brothers collapsed in September 2008. By October, HBOS was effectively bust, he claimed, after a \u201cmassive haemorrhaging of cash\u201d. \u201cWe are saying shareholders were mugged in this acquisition and should never have been kept in the dark,\u201d said Hill. As well as Blank and Daniels, former finance director Tim Tookey, former head of retail Helen Weir and former head of wholesale banking Truett Tate are named in the case and are scheduled to give evidence. The case is expected to run until March. Lloyds announced the takeover of HBOS on 18 September 2008. The government eventually took a 43% stake in the enlarged Lloyds Banking Group but no longer owns any shares after selling its final tranche in May. At the time of the deal, it emerged that Brown had discussed the deal with Blank at a Citibank drinks party just days before it was announced to the market. \u201cThe government was encouraging Lloyds to buy HBOS and to relieve the government of the burden of nationalising HBOS,\u201d said Hill, adding that this left Lloyds shareholders with \u201ccatastrophic losses\u201d. He said that by the end of September, days after the deal was first announced, \u201cHBOS was bust and would have had to close its doors unless it could find an emergency bail out\u201d. Hill told Mr Justice Norris that Lloyds had been bullied into taking over HBOS by being told that it would need a \u00a37bn bailout in October 2008 \u2013 when the government announced plan to rescue the sector \u2013 if it did not carry through with the deal. In correspondence Hill read out in court, a Lloyds banker is said to have described the HBOS deal as \u201ctransferring the monkey from theirs to our shoulders\u201d. Lloyds is scheduled to outline its defence on Thursday and said: \u201cThe group\u2019s position remains that we do not consider there to be any merit to these claims and we will robustly contest this legal action.\u201d The case continues.",

      "bodyText": "And finally.... here\u2019s our economics editor Larry Elliott on today\u2019s labour market report: Firstly, it is clear that the economy is great at creating jobs but hopeless at generating pay rises. Employment is up by more than 300,000 over the past year but average earnings growth at 2.2% is slightly lower than it was in the summer of 2016. Secondly, while employment has been a lot stronger than was feared in the run-up to the Brexit referendum, the pace of growth eased in the three months ending in August. Finally, there is no immediate end in sight for the fall in real (inflation-adjusted) wages which have now fallen for a sixth successive month. The Resolution Foundation notes that real average earnings are no higher now than they were in 2016. Larry adds: It will be well into 2018 before pay growth overtakes inflation \u2013 and this relentless squeeze on living standards will have retailers nervous as the key Christmas period nears. Consumers face a choice: tighten their belts or get deeper into debt. Here\u2019s his full analysis: That\u2019s probably all for today. Thanks for reading and commenting. GW The pound has dropped against the US dollar since today\u2019s jobs and earnings figures were released. Sterling has dropped by 0.2% to $1.3166, and is a little lower against the euro at \u20ac1.119. That\u2019s quite a muted reaction -- reflecting the fact that nothing\u2019s really changed in the UK today. The economy is still creating jobs, and people still aren\u2019t getting pay increases that keep pace with inflation. So the Bank of England still has to decide whether it should raised interest rates next month, or leave borrowing costs at their record low a bit longer. Last month, it suggested that rates could rise in November; this sparked a sterling rally, which has faded in recent days. Chris Bailey, European strategist at wealth manager Raymond James, says the BoE faces a tough dilemma: \u201cStronger inflation figures would normally point towards a potential interest rate hike which we know is not too far around the corner. But wage growth is an ongoing concern and an interest rate rise would put pressure on the consumer who is already having their earnings eaten away by inflation. \u201cGiven these factors I believe it is likely that we will see a minor tweak up in interest rates in November but it is not something that I would vote for if I was sitting on the Committee. Concerns around ongoing Brexit discussions and its prevailing uncertainties have only been deepened by today\u2019s disappointing wage growth figures.\u201d Here\u2019s our economics correspondent, Richard Partington, on today\u2019s labour market report: The lowest levels of unemployment since the mid-70s are still failing to boost the bargaining power of workers in the UK, as official figures show a sixth month of negative real earnings. Average earnings increased by 2.2% in the three months to August, the same level recorded in the three months to July after a revision to the earlier figures, according to the Office for National Statistics. City economists had forecast growth of 2.1%. When taking account of inflation, the ONS said real wages fell by 0.4% on the previous year, despite the unemployment rate remaining steady at 4.3% \u2013 the joint lowest level since 1975. The figures will perplex the Bank of England as it prepares for the first interest rate hike in a decade from as early as next month. The central bank has been looking for signs of pay growth as it seeks to balance a trade-off between supporting jobs and the economy with low rates and cutting the growth in prices. Howard Archer, chief economic adviser to the EY Item Club, said the data \u201cfails to provide a decisive case\u201d for the Bank to increase the cost of borrowing from 0.25%. \u201cThe squeeze on consumers remains appreciable, with obvious negative implications for personal expenditure,\u201d he said. The latest fall in real pay means that average earnings are no higher than they were in February 2006, despite the economy being 4.4% bigger per person than at that time, according to the Resolution Foundation. More here: Over in parliament, prime minister Theresa May and Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn have sparred over today\u2019s labour market figures. Corbyn welcomed the drop in unemployment (\u2018a first\u2019, according to May), before arguing that the fall in real wages shows the economy is weak. What\u2019s the government going to do about it? May says the government have cut taxes from basic taxpayers (due to the rise in the tax-free allowance, I think), the Living wage, and the doubling of free childcare. This prompted Corbyn to suggest May breaks her own duck and answers his question... Here\u2019s a clip: Andy Sparrow\u2019s liveblog has full details of what many commentators are calling a win for the member for Islington North. Britain\u2019s youth unemployment rate has fallen to 11.9% over the last year, from 13.7%. That\u2019s because fewer 16-24 year olds are looking for work, and more are in full-time education (or economically inactive for other reasons). But the real wage squeeze is hurting young people who are in work (earlier this week, we learned that many are having to borrow to pay for basics) Dr Carole Easton OBE, chief executive of the Young Women\u2019s Trust, says young mothers are finding it particularly tough: \u201cWe have a youth debt epidemic and, as prices rise and wages remain low, this is only set to worsen. It\u2019s time for action. \u201cYoung women in particular are getting stuck on low pay, falling into debt and using foodbanks to put food on the table. It can be especially hard for young mums; in many cases, low pay means an hour\u2019s childcare can cost more than an hour\u2019s wages. Estate agents and hairdressers are suffering some of the tightest wage squeezes, today\u2019s report shows. City workers, administrators and IT staff, though, are getting inflation-beating pay packets: (this shows real wages - so pay minus inflation) Britain\u2019s employment rate has fallen back from its record high. The proportion of 16-64 year olds in work dipped to 75.1% in the three months to August, down from 75.3% a month ago. The employment rate had been rising steadily since the end of 2011, as Britain clawed its way back from the financial crisis. Now, it\u2019s very plausible that last month\u2019s small fall is only a blip. But, it could be a sign that the labour market has peaked..... Sarah O\u2019Connor, the FT\u2019s employment correspondent, tweets: Here are more figures from the Resolution Foundation, showing how the wage squeeze will intensify in the run-up to Christmas. A handy breakdown of the UK labour market: This graph shows how UK unemployment fell to 4.3% in the last quarter. There are now 1.44 million unemployed people in the UK, down 215,000 in the last year. The jobless rate hasn\u2019t been lower since since Harold Wilson was prime minister. This chart shows how wage growth slowed at the start of this year, and hasn\u2019t recovered strongly since. An extra 420,000 jobs have been created in the last year -- this chart shows the key changes: Britain\u2019s bosses (the men and women with their hands on the purse strings) argue that productivity needs to rise so they can deliver wage increases. Matthew Percival, CBI Head of Employment, says the government can, and must, help: \u201cPersistently weak productivity, coupled with falling real wages, continues to hit living standards, underlining the need for the Chancellor to bold in his Budget. \u201cDelivering urgent progress on large and small infrastructure projects, addressing underfunding in education and providing practical support for innovators are all steps the Government can take as part of a meaningful Industrial Strategy to boost productivity, the only sustainable route to improving people\u2019s pay.\u201d The Resolution Foundation have spotted that average earnings (adjusted for inflation) are no higher than they were back in February 2006, thanks to this latest slump in real wages. Stephen Clarke, their economic analyst, explains: \u201cToday\u2019s figures confirm the big picture trend that the UK labour market is great at creating jobs, but terrible at raising people\u2019s pay. \u201cThe scale of the pay squeeze over the last decade is so vast that people today are earning no more than they did back in February 2006, despite the economy being 4.4 per cent bigger per person since then.\u201d Britons would need a \u00a315 per week pay rise to get back to the levels before the financial crisis. Geraint Johnes, professor of Economics at Lancaster University Management School, has spotted that workers in the financial sector are getting decent enough pay rises.... The 3 month average measure of total pay growth indicates that earnings have risen by 2.2% over the last year. This represents no change on the previous month. There has been some acceleration in pay in the financial and business services (where pay growth is now 2.7%, or, on the less reliable single-month measure, 3.1%). But in many industries \u2013 including the public sector, manufacturing, construction and distribution \u2013 pay growth is still below 2%. This does not suggest that it is yet time for the Bank of England to be hiking interest rates.\u201d Jeremy Cook, Chief Economist at WorldFirst, fears that UK unemployment will soon start to rise. He argues that the wage squeeze means consumers will spend less in the shops, hitting profits and forcing firms to lay off staff (creating something of a vicious circle...) He writes: \u201cThe story of the labour market remains the same: more people earning weaker wages. These figures do nothing to change our belief that a lack of real wage gains are going to continue to impinge on the ability of consumers to remain the driving force of UK growth. \u201cThe pace of price increases is at a near-term high and the next few months may also mark the peak of employment. UK businesses, particularly those who import from abroad or are part of global supply chains, have laboured under a slowing economy and higher costs courtesy of the falling pound. Should neither consumption or investment provide these companies \u2013 particularly retailers - with a strong Christmas, then we would expect to see the \u2018good\u2019 news of falling unemployment start to reverse as businesses react to lost margins cutting into the corporate bone.\u201d Real wages will probably keep shrinking for many more months, warns James Smith of ING: Crunching the numbers, we don\u2019t expect wage growth to go much above 2.1% or 2.2% before next summer. So whilst we expect headline inflation to peak at 3.1% next month, the gap between CPI and wage growth is likely to stay fairly wide for some time to come. Maike Currie, investment director for Personal Investing at Fidelity International, says the rise of the \u2018gig\u2019 economy, and the government\u2019s public sector pay cap, are partly to blame for the wage squeeze. \u201cAnother month, another fall in real household incomes. Today\u2019s wage growth figures show our total earnings including bonuses grew at just 2.2% in the three months to August . With yesterday\u2019s CPI figures showing inflation spiking to an eye watering 3%, the gap between our pay packets and the cost of goods and services continues to remain vast - our wages are not keeping up with the rising cost of living. \u201cThe absence of wage growth remains the missing piece of the puzzle in the UK\u2019s slow road to recovery - high employment should be the worker\u2019s best friend because that\u2019s what pushes up wages. With UK unemployment at a 45-year low, one would think that workers\u2019 bargaining power at the wage negotiation table would improve, yet earnings growth remains elusive and the UK\u2019s workforce is getting poorer. There are many potential reasons for this ranging from poor productivity to the squeeze on public sector pay and the rise of self-employment in the so-called \u2018gig economy\u2019. The employment minister, Damian Hinds, has welcomed the news that Britain\u2019s unemployment rate remains at a 42-year low, with 32.10 million people in work (up 317,000 in the last year.). Hinds says: \u201cOur economy is helping to create full time, permanent jobs which are giving people across the UK the chance of securing a reliable income. \u201cWe\u2019ve boosted the income for people on the lowest pay by increasing the National Living Wage and delivered the fastest pay rise for the lowest earners in 20 years. \u201cThat\u2019s great progress and we\u2019re determined to help more people flourish in the world of work. \u201cFor example we\u2019ve launched our new returnship programme to help more women get into good jobs after taking time out, and to keep their career progressing.\u201d Andy Bruce of Reuters has spotted that workers in the hospitality industry are suffering a sharp pay squeeze: British workers have now suffered six months of falling real wages, as this chart shows: With inflation now at 3%, a 2.1% per year pay rise simply isn\u2019t enough, says the TUC\u2019s general secretary Frances O\u2019Grady: \u201cPay packets are taking a hammering. This is the sixth month in a row that prices have risen faster than wages. \u201cBritain desperately needs a pay rise. Working people are earning less today (in real-terms) than a decade ago. \u201cThe Chancellor must help struggling families when he gives his Budget next month. This means ditching the artificial pay restrictions on nurses, midwives and other public sector workers. And investing in jobs that people can live on.\u201d Breaking! Wage growth across the UK is still lagging behind inflation, even though the unemployment rate remains at its lowest level in 42-years. Average earnings, excluding bonuses, rose by 2.1% per year in the three months to August. That\u2019s down from 2.2% a month ago. Including bonuses, wages rose by 2.2% - matching last month\u2019s figures. That means that real wages are still shrinking -- inflation was 2.6% in July (the mid-point of the quarter), and jumped to 3% in September. The Office for National Statistics also reports that Britain\u2019s unemployment rate remained at 4.3%, the lowest since 1975, thanks to another drop in the number of people out of work. Here are the key points from today\u2019s Labour Market report: The unemployment rate was 4.3% in the three months to August 2017, the joint lowest since 1975. There were 94,000 more people in work compared with the three months to May 2017, out of which 78,000 were women. The inactivity rate was 21.4%, down slightly when compared with the previous three months. In real terms, average weekly earnings fell by 0.4% on the previous year (excluding bonuses) and by 0.3% (including bonuses). In the three months to June 2017 (the latest available period), the probability of remaining in employment, for those in work, was 97.3%, the highest comparable rate since 1997. More to follow! Over in Frankfurt, ECB president Mario Draghi is making another push for \u2018structural reforms\u2019 in the eurozone. Draghi\u2019s arguing (once again) that political leaders have a \u2018window of opportunity\u2019 to reform their economies, thanks to the eurozone\u2019s current record low interest rates and QE programme. Usually, these talks focus on labour market reforms - which can be code for making it easier to hire and fire staff. Draghi, though, is arguing for wider reforms to the way businesses work -- and blasting \u2018vested interests\u2019 who are holding things back. Unlike what happened in the years even before the crisis, labour market reforms must be preceded \u2013 or least accompanied by \u2013 product market reforms, otherwise wage adjustments will not be fully passed on to prices. Instead, profit mark-ups will rise and the purchasing power of households will fall, thereby worsening the economic conditions of consumers and aggravating any recession. During the crisis, because of powerful vested interests, labour market reforms were not accompanied by product market reforms in some countries, and so wages fell and prices did not adjust in tandem. We have fresh evidence that London\u2019s property market is cooling, from estate agent Foxtons. Foxtons has told the City that conditions remained \u201cchallenging\u2019 in the last quarter Sales in July to September dropped to \u00a310.3m, from \u00a312.3m a year ago. Rob Holdsworth of the Resolution Foundation tweets: Today\u2019s average weekly earnings figures will be \u2018key\u2019 for the markets today, says Marc Ostwald of ADM Investor Services: No change is seen in headline terms at a still very lowly 2.1% y/y, while the \u2018core\u2019 ex-Bonus measure is forecast to dip to 2.0% from 2.1%. This will leave real earnings deep in negative territory, leaving plenty of room for doubt on whether wages are turning or have turned a corner as some MPC members have claimed, and certainly beg the question on the need for, or the wisdom of a rate hike. This chart from economist Rupert Seggins shows how UK real wages have been shrinking for several months. Today\u2019s earnings data will show show that trend continuing. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Today we\u2019ll be looking at Britain\u2019s jobs market, and asking why people aren\u2019t being paid more when employment is at record levels. The latest labour market statistics, due this morning, will probably confirm that headline employment is at record levels, but that pay is still not keeping up with inflation. City experts predict that that headline unemployment rate remained at just 4.3% in the three months to August. That would be the joint-lowest in 42 years, as the labour market holds up well in the face of Brexit uncertainty. But wage growth will probably remain worryingly weak, at around 2.1% (possibly falling to 2.0% per year if you strip out bonuses). That would mean another fall in real wages, as inflation jumped to 3% yesterday. This is puzzling economists (in theory, you\u2019d expect wages to rise once labour becomes scarce). But in the world of the Gig Economy, many workers are actually facing uncertain hours, poor conditions and weak wage growth. It all feeds into the wider conundrum of Britain\u2019s weak productivity, and whether the country can actually handle a rise in interest rates. Today\u2019s figures will be closely monitored by economists, business leaders, and investors. Craig Erlam, Senior Market Analyst at OANDA, says: Once again though, the unemployment data is expected to paint one picture with the rate remaining at 4.3% while average earnings paints an entirely different one, as wages rise by only 2.1%. Negative earnings growth is one of the factors that is likely to weigh on the economy going forward and makes the BoE\u2019s decision on interest rates all the more difficult. Also coming up today Consumer good giant Reckitt Benckiser, chemicals and paint maker Akzo Nobel, and London estate agent Foxtons are reporting results. Mining giant Rio Tinto is in the spotlight today. Former CEO Tom Albanese and ex-CFO Guy Elliott have been charged with fraud by US officials, over coal assets in Mozambique which were bought for $3.7bn and later sold for just $50m. Albanese and Elliott are accused of inflating the value of the assets. Both men deny any wrongdoing. More on this shortly.... Investors will be keeping an eye on China, as the Chinese party congress begins. President Xi got the ball rolling by hailing the dawn of a \u201cnew era\u201d of Chinese politics and power. In a speech lasting over three hours, Xi declared: \u201cThis is a new historic juncture in China\u2019s development. \u201cThe Chinese nation ... has stood up, grown rich, and become strong - and it now embraces the brilliant prospects of rejuvenation ... It will be an era that sees China moving closer to centre stage and making greater contributions to mankind.\u201d Here\u2019s the agenda: 9.10am BST: European Central Bank president Mario Draghi gives a speech in Frankfurt. It\u2019s on \u201cStructural reforms in the euro area\u201d, one of Draghi\u2019s favourite subjects. 9.30am BST: UK labour market report 1.30pm BST: US housing data for September. It\u2019ll show how many building permits were issued, and how many new construction projects began",

      "bodyText": "The financier George Soros has transferred about $18bn (\u00a313.7bn) to his human rights foundation, bringing his lifetime giving to $32bn and making the foundation one of the world\u2019s largest. The donation makes Soros\u2019s Open Society Foundations the third largest charitable foundation in the world, behind the Bill and Melinda Gates foundation and the Wellcome Trust. Officials from the foundation told the Wall Street Journal and the New York Times that the Hungarian-born investor has increased the pace of donations from the proceeds of his successful hedge fund. The latest combined donations of $18bn represent the bulk of Soros\u2019s estimated fortune of $23bn. Open Society works globally to \u201cbuild vibrant and tolerant democracies\u201d and has given away nearly $14bn since it was founded in 1979. Soros, who made huge profits betting against the British pound when it crashed out of the European exchange rate mechanism in 1992, is a vocal supporter of liberal causes.

      "bodyText": "Anglo-Australian mining giant Rio Tinto has been charged with fraud in the US and fined \u00a327.4m in the UK after being accused of overstating the value of African coal assets. The FTSE 100 company and two of its top former executives were charged in the US of hiding losses by inflating the value of assets in Mozambique, which Rio bought in 2011 for $3.7bn ($2.8bn) and sold a few years later for $50m. America\u2019s financial regulator, the Securities and and Exchange Commission, filed a complaint in federal court in Manhattan. It alleges that Rio Tinto, its former chief executive, Tom Albanese, and its former chief financial officer, Guy Elliott, failed to follow accounting standards and company policies to accurately value and record its assets. As the project began to suffer setbacks, resulting in the rapid decline of the value of the coal assets, Albanese and Elliott sought to hide or delay disclosure of the nature and extent of the adverse developments from Rio Tinto\u2019s board of directors, auditors, and investors, the SEC alleges. \u201cRio Tinto and its top executives allegedly failed to come clean about an unsuccessful deal that was made under their watch. They tried to save their own careers at the expense of investors by hiding the truth,\u201d said Steven Peikin, co-director of the SEC\u2019s enforcement division. The miner said it intends to \u201cvigorously defend itself\u201d against the allegations. \u201cRio Tinto believes that the SEC case is unwarranted and that, when all the facts are considered by the court, or if necessary by a jury, the SEC\u2019s claims will be rejected,\u201d the company said in a statement. Shell announced that Elliott was immediately leaving his position as a non-executive director at the Anglo-Dutch oil company as a result of his involvement in the legal case. \u201cWe sincerely hope he satisfactorily resolves those proceedings and, that in that event, he would like to be considered for rejoining the board,\u201d said Charles Holliday, Shell\u2019s chairman. Rio Tinto was separately fined \u00a327.4m by the UK\u2019s financial watchdog for breaching disclosure and transparency rules over its handling of the Mozambique mining assets. It is the largest fine imposed by the Financial Conduct Authority on a company for a breach of rules relating to a firm\u2019s official listing. The Financial Conduct Authority said the fine would have been bigger at \u00a339.1m but the penalty was reduced because Rio Tinto agreed to settle at an early stage. Rio failed to carry out an impairment test and to recognise an impairment loss on the value of mining assets, which should have been disclosed in 2012 half-year results, the FCA said. \u201cThe UK listing regime requires listed companies to adhere to high standards of disclosure and transparency,\u201d said Mark Steward, executive director of enforcement and market oversight at the FCA. \u201cRio Tinto should have been aware of its obligation to carry out the impairment test and the resulting material impairment should have been reported to the market at its half year results in 2012.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Big energy companies face a regulatory crackdown after the industry watchdog threatened to impose targets forcing suppliers to shift millions of customers off the market\u2019s worst-value tariffs. Dermot Nolan, the Ofgem chief executive, said companies had failed to act quickly enough and should move faster to take customers off the standard variable tariffs which about two-thirds of households are on. British Gas and SSE, the two companies that have the highest percentage of customers on such tariffs, were accused of failing to move users on to a better deal. \u201cThey have not made progress or initiatives in the way that perhaps some other companies have announced,\u201d Nolan told MPs. He said that while 2m fewer customers were on standard variable tariffs than a year ago, the market was still not working as well as it should. On the prospect of setting targets to mandate the energy companies to move people off such tariffs, he said: \u201cWe are still likely to do that.\u201d Recent plans by E.ON and ScottishPower to phase out the tariffs were \u201cnot perfect\u201d, he said, but were signs of progress. Centrica, British Gas\u2019s owner, told the business select committee that it wanted to see the death of the standard variable tariff rather than the implementation of a price cap as planned by the government. \u201cIn our view there is an issue with engagement but we don\u2019t think the solution is price caps, we think price caps will hinder competition,\u201d said Sarwjit Sambhi, the managing director of Centrica\u2019s home unit, which includes British Gas. \u201cOur proposal is to end the evergreen nature of the standard variable tariff.\u201d Sambhi denied that British Gas was subsidising its cheapest fixed deals by overcharging customers on its standard variable tariff. But under questioning he admitted that 70% of its supply business\u2019s \u00a3550m profits last year were from standard variable tariffs, despite them accounting for 65% of its customer base. He was asked five times by Rachel Reeves, the committee\u2019s Labour chair, whether he would mount a legal challenge against Ofgem if a cap was not backed up by legislation. He would not be drawn on the question, and did not rule out a challenge. But Sambhi said that a narrower cap which came into effect in April did not reflect the costs energy suppliers faced, in particular for fitting smart meters in millions of homes. Ofgem said last week\u2019s publication of draft legislation for the cap would not be enough to see off such challenges on its own, and the law would need to be passed before a ceiling was imposed. \u201cBefore setting any final cap I\u2019m afraid we would need royal assent to have that degree of certainty,\u201d said Nolan. Smaller energy companies told the MPs that, contrary to what Centrica argued, a cap was \u201cessential\u201d for stopping suppliers exploiting customers. \u201cAfter 19 years of deregulation, nothing has worked,\u201d said Stephen Fitzpatrick, the chief executive of OVO, one of the biggest challenger companies. \u201cBy far and away the simplest way to protect consumers \u2026 is to have a well-set, regulatory price cap,\u201d he said. Greg Jackson, the chief executive of small supplier Octopus, said: \u201cWe\u2019ve already heard the usual argument of the big six, essentially blaming consumers for not engaging.

      "bodyText": "Adani has spread its use of offshore tax havens to its Australian solar projects, providing another avenue that could allow the wealthy Indian family behind the transnational to legally minimise tax paid on income from local operations. Six companies linked to Adani\u2019s renewables business, which chairman Gautam Adani wants to make the biggest in Australia by 2022, were registered with the Australian Securities and Investments Commission on 3 August. The companies all have Australian-based Adani executives as directors. But they fall into two groups \u2013 three companies in each \u2013 which follow a markedly different path to their ultimate owners. One trail leads back to Adani Enterprises, the stockmarket-listed company in India which is vying to build Australia\u2019s largest coalmine, and in which the Adani family are the major shareholders. The other bypasses the public company in India entirely, leading back to the Adani family via privately owned companies based in the Cayman and British Virgin islands, recognised tax havens. The companies were registered a month before the energy giant said it would proceed with \u201cone of the world\u2019s most advanced solar energy plants\u201d at Rugby Run near Moranbah, the largest of three plants Adani proposes in central Queensland and South Australia. Gautam Adani trumpeted the group\u2019s Australian solar ambitions when announcing a power purchasing agreement for Rugby Run with an unnamed but \u201csignificant power retailer\u201d. \u201cWe are the largest generator of solar energy in India and we aim to replicate that in Australia,\u201d he said. Adani bought Rugby Run \u2013 a former cattle property once earmarked as a rail thoroughfare for transporting coal from its contentious Carmichael mine \u2013 for $1 on 9 June last year from Queensland beef barons the Acton family, transfer documents show. The site gives its name to one of three companies that signal the start of the tax haven trail from the Australian solar business: Adani Rugby Run Operations Pty Ltd, Adani Renewable Operations Pty Ltd and Adani Renewable Operations Holdings Pty Ltd. All three companies have a parent company in Singapore, Global Renewable Energy Holding Pte Ltd, which was incorporated in January with Vinod Shantilal Adani as sole director. Singapore company filings show Global Renewable Energy Holding Pte Ltd is owned by Atulya Resources Ltd in the Cayman Islands. Atulya Resources is in turn owned by ARFT Holding Ltd in the British Virgin Islands. Documents held by the Singapore corporate regulator disclose that \u201cthe Adani Family\u201d is an ultimate shareholder of ARFT Holding Ltd. Back in Australia, the other three companies registered in August were Adani Renewable Assets, Adani Renewable Asset Holdings and Adani Rugby Run. They are held by Adani Global Pte Ltd in Singapore, which is held by Adani Global Ltd in Mauritius, in turn owned by the public company Adani Enterprises Ltd in India. Adam Walters, the principal researcher for Energy Resource Insights, who uncovered the new tax haven links, said Adani\u2019s use of tax havens and parallel company structures was entirely legal. But he said they could enable the Adani family to generate income from operating the solar farms, via agreements with the public Indian parent company that owned the assets. These profits could then be channelled to the Adani family via the Cayman and British Virgin islands, which would have favourable tax implications for them, Walters said. \u201cRather than benefit because of their shareholdings in listed companies in India where they have to pay lots of tax, they could benefit via the British Virgin Islands,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat could well be the case is the listed companies have got the money behind them, they can build the things, but then the profits can be generated in the family-owned businesses.\u201d Walters said this was a pattern suggested elsewhere in Adani\u2019s corporate structures around Australian mine and rail projects. It arose when Adani Mining had an opportunity to dispose of a future liability worth billions, in the form of a $2 a tonne royalty deed held by the original owner of the Carmichael mine site, Linc Energy. When a distressed Linc agreed to offload the deed for $150m in 2014, it was not Adani Mining that bought it. Instead, Adani Mining lent $150m to an Adani family-held trust, linked to the rail project, to snap it up. \u201cThis means that the family could potentially receive over a billion dollars in the Caribbean even if the mine is unprofitable in Australia,\u201d Walters said. \u201cAdani Mining, rather than spending $150m, now have an IOU on their balance sheet for $150m. In the short term, the company looks healthier than it actually is and in the longer term, if the mine does go ahead then the Adani family make the money.\u201d The trust that could enrich the family through coal royalties is held via the same tax haven companies as the solar companies. The $150m was one of several multimillion-dollar loans in Australia by public Adani company subsidiaries to private Adani family-owned companies. \u201cIf [the solar business] is the same as elsewhere, we know the Adani family has not actually put a single dollar into Australia \u2013 they\u2019re inter-company loans to the family from the listed company,\u201d Walters said. He said there were another three trusts registered by Adani in Australia around the solar projects but \u201cbeneficial ownership of these remains unclear at this stage\u201d. The chief executive of Adani Mining, Jeyakumar Janakaraj, has dismissed any suggestion the Australian operations would be \u201chiding profits\u201d via holding companies in tax havens. \u201cThere is absolutely no implication of this, as everything that is being done in Australia or in India is transparent,\u201d he told India\u2019s Economic Times. \u201cWe make regular filings to the tax offices and government authorities. This report is a desperate attempt by the activists who were not able to legally stall the [Carmichael] project or get the government to do it. \u201cThis is their last attempt to hurt the goodwill we enjoy, but we are going ahead with the project as planned.\u201d The 175-megawatt plant would rate among Australia\u2019s biggest solar projects, along with Adani\u2019s proposed 100MW farm at Crinium Creek, also in central Queensland, and a 140MW far near Whyalla in South Australia. Adani is the largest solar generator in India. Adani declined to comment on the company arrangements.",
