    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Wizz Air remains rooted to the bottom of Lord Davies\u2019s league table of companies with female directors, after an executive reshuffle passed without a woman in sight. The Hungarian airline came out worst among FTSE 350 companies in last week\u2019s update of the Davies review of gender balance on boards, with an eight-strong boardroom composed entirely of men. Although it welcomed a new director on Wednesday, Wizz Air\u2019s choice \u2013 executive vice president John Stephenson \u2013 ensured that the corridors of power at the no-frills carrier remain a male-only zone. The imbalance at Wizz Air, which floated on the London stock market earlier this year, drew criticism from executive recruitment firm Norman Broadbent. \u201cIt is unbelievable that a FTSE 350 company has come to market without any regard to the gender diversity on its board,\u201d said Neil Holmes, managing director of boad practice at the recruiter. \u201cThere are many female candidates who are qualified and experienced to take up senior positions, and businesses have a responsibility to consider them for any role, equal to their male counterparts. \u201cThere was an opportunity here for Wizz Air to appoint females from parallel sectors such as consumer or distribution, to balance the gender divide and add breadth to the senior management team \u2013 instead these women do not seem to have even been considered.\u201d Wizz Air pointed out that its senior ranks have not always been men-only. \u201cWe\u2019re aware of and support diversity on boards \u2013 it is a matter of record that we have had a female board member in the past,\u201d it said. The only female director at Wizz Air, non-executive Heather Lawrence, left during the last financial year. The company hinted that it is now casting its eye over suitable women in its continuing hunt for a new non-executive director. \u201cWe need the best person for the non-executive role and the search is being conducted with diversity very much in mind.\u201d Wizz Air is one of just 15 companies in the UK\u2019s top 350 that still have an all-male board. Others include bull-semen specialist Genus, car dealer Lookers and Abu Dhabi-based medical group Al Noor Hospitals. An update of Lord Davies\u2019s review, published last week, revealed that 26% of directorships in the FTSE 350 are held by women, ahead of the 25% target he set in 2011. But the former trade minister and ex-Standard Chartered chief executive urged firms to reach 33% by 2020. And he called on companies to \u201cget their house in order\u201d by appointing more women to decision-making executive roles. While 31% of non-executives are female, according to the review, the proportion slumps to less than 10% in more influential executive positions. Wizz Air is an outlier among travel and leisure firms, where the proportion of women is on average higher than in industries such as oil and gas or mining. InterContinental Hotels is the most female-friendly among travel and leisure firms, with an even 50:50 split on its board. Wizz Air\u2019s power structure distracted from a set of financial results that showed strong rises in revenues, passenger numbers and profit in the first half of the year. Pre-tax earnings jumped 16.4% to \u20ac190.9m (\u00a3135m) on revenues that rose 15% to \u20ac836.4m. The result was fuelled by a 20% surge in passenger numbers to 10.65 million. Seats on its fleet of 63 Airbus A320 aircraft were also 90.7% occupied during the six-month period, a 1.7 percentage point increase on the previous year. But investors proved skittish after the firm said finance chief Mike Powell was stepping down for \u201cpersonal reasons\u201d, and its share price fell 4.19% to close at 1,850p. Wizz Air ordered 110 new Airbus A321s for delivery between 2019 and 2024, with an option to buy a further 90 of the 239-seat aircraft. The deal has a catalogue value of nearly \u00a39bn, although the bulk purchase means the airline is likely to have secured a large discount on the nominal price tag. The first of 38 new A320 and A321ceo models is due to arrive in November, as Wizz Air looks to capitalise on good conditions for airlines. The airline plans to increase capacity by 18% this year as it takes advantage of low oil prices, allowing it to attract new customers with bargain fares.",

    "webTitle": "VW emissions scandal still obscured by a cloud", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The surprise is that Volkswagen\u2019s shares fell only 10% as the cheating affair deepened in several ways. First, the scandal now covers emissions of carbon dioxide, or CO2, not only nitrogen oxide. Second, some petrol engines are now involved. Third \u2013 perhaps most importantly for shareholders who hope VW can recover quickly \u2013 the company still seems incapable of giving a straightforward account of what its own investigation has uncovered. Tuesday evening\u2019s statement contained the obligatory expressions of regret and commitment to transparency. Indeed, Matthias M\u00fcller, the executive shoved into the hot seat in the first week of the crisis, opted for pomposity overdrive. \u201cFrom the very start I have pushed hard for the relentless and comprehensive clarification of events,\u201d he declared. \u201cWe will stop at nothing and nobody. This is a painful process, but it is our only alternative. For us, the only thing that counts is the truth.\u201d What, though, did VW actually say beyond the confession that \u201cbased on present knowledge\u201d 800,000 vehicles have been affected? Almost nothing. Were cheat devices attached to the vehicles, or were real CO2 emissions disguised by other means? How many petrol cars are affected? Does the phrase \u201cpresent knowledge\u201d mean most cars in VW\u2019s fleet are in the clear, or that they haven\u2019t yet been examined for CO2? And, since the word \u201cirregularities\u201d is so vague, how severely wrong is the published CO2 data? None of these issues were addressed. A little reticence is understandable while investigations continue but it is not unreasonable to expect VW to explain why it can\u2019t answer questions that would occur to most readers of its statement. More disgracefully from the point of view of shareholders, the company failed to explain how it derived its estimate that the latest revelations will cost \u201capproximately \u20ac2bn\u201d. Does that figure merely cover tax credits that now would appear to have been unfairly earned? Analysts assume so, in which case there could also be a wave of claims from consumers who were encouraged to buy VW vehicles on the basis of bogus claims about fuel efficiency. Analysts at Exane BNP Paribas, for example, added \u20ac4bn for recall and compensation costs for customers. That assumption sounds fair. The point, though, is that VW ought to be able say what its \u20ac2bn covers and what it doesn\u2019t. Sadly, though, whatever M\u00fcller says about following a \u201cpath of clarification and transparency\u201d, ambiguity has been the hallmark of VW\u2019s statements for the past month. If that\u2019s the approach, outsiders will naturally assume this scandal could become substantially worse. Germany\u2019s chancellor, Angela Merkel, must be tearing her hair out. She is trying to deflect damage to the country\u2019s industrial and engineering reputation but is obliged to defend, half-heartedly, a VW boardroom that still seems to be in a state of shock. Merkel could help herself by insisting that VW \u2013 a company whose senior ranks are dominated by a cosy-looking alliance of family shareholders, local Saxony officials and trade unionists \u2013 imports some senior independent outsiders to oversee the inquiry. The company\u2019s current crew seems to prefer obfuscation and is making matters worse. Success for M&amp;S \u2013 after a fashion Clothing sales down, profit margins up. It\u2019s becoming a regular theme at Marks &amp; Spencer and, for the time being, the mixed bag \u2013 yielding a 6% rise in underlying pre-tax profits to \u00a3284m \u2013 should satisfy shareholders. M&amp;S is now buying at sharper prices by designing more clothes inhouse and is finding savings in its supply chain. Both ingredients were missing in the early years of Marc Bolland\u2019s reign but, finally, the chief executive is in the expectation-beating game. Last year\u2019s increase in gross margins was 1.9 percentage points and Bolland thinks M&amp;S will beat that figure this year If the well-paid Lindsey brothers, Neal and Mark, are responsible for injecting some Next-style rigour into M&amp;S\u2019s sourcing network, they\u2019re earning their keep. When your turnover in general merchandise is \u00a34bn, percentage points matter. Yet a 1.2% fall in like-for-like sales in general merchandise \u2013 indeed, a 1.9% tumble in the second quarter \u2013 can\u2019t be ignored. Remember, these are declines upon declines. Perpetual loss of market share in clothing is not a long-term option for M&amp;S. One day the sagging sales line may have to be confronted head-on by recycling efficiency savings into lower prices for customers. That date with destiny, though, is not now. Today, the M&amp;S arithmetic works. After a long period of heavy capital expenditure, the business is generating lots of cash \u2013 \u00a3256m in the six-month period \u2013 and debt is falling steadily, allowing a 6% hike in the dividend and, presumably, more share buybacks in time. The food division continues its winning ways and only the international side, inevitably hampered by Russia and currencies, is a drag. Bolland deserves more credit than he\u2019s getting.",

      "body": "<p>The surprise is that Volkswagen\u2019s shares fell only 10% as <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/nov/04/vw-volkswagen-shares-slide-10-carbon-dioxide-revelations\">the cheating affair deepened in several ways</a>. First, the scandal now covers emissions of carbon dioxide, or CO<sub>2</sub>, not only nitrogen oxide. Second, some petrol engines are now involved. Third \u2013 perhaps most importantly for shareholders who hope VW can recover quickly \u2013 the company still seems incapable of giving a straightforward account of what its own investigation has uncovered.</p> <p>Tuesday evening\u2019s statement contained the obligatory expressions of regret and commitment to transparency. Indeed, Matthias M\u00fcller, the executive shoved into the hot seat in the first week of the crisis, opted for pomposity overdrive.</p> <p>\u201cFrom the very start I have pushed hard for the relentless and comprehensive clarification of events,\u201d he declared. \u201cWe will stop at nothing and nobody. This is a painful process, but it is our only alternative. For us, the only thing that counts is the truth.\u201d</p> <p>What, though, did VW actually say beyond the confession that \u201cbased on present knowledge\u201d 800,000 vehicles have been affected? Almost nothing. Were cheat devices attached to the vehicles, or were real CO<sub tabindex=\"-1\">2</sub> emissions disguised by other means? How many petrol cars are affected? Does the phrase \u201cpresent knowledge\u201d mean most cars in VW\u2019s fleet are in the clear, or that they haven\u2019t yet been examined for CO<sub tabindex=\"-1\">2</sub>? And, since the word \u201cirregularities\u201d is so vague, how severely wrong is the published CO<sub tabindex=\"-1\">2</sub> data? None of these issues were addressed.</p> <p>A little reticence is understandable while investigations continue but it is not unreasonable to expect VW to explain why it can\u2019t answer questions that would occur to most readers of its statement. </p> <p>More disgracefully from the point of view of shareholders, the company failed to explain how it derived its estimate that the latest revelations will cost \u201capproximately \u20ac2bn\u201d. Does that figure merely cover tax credits that now would appear to have been unfairly earned? Analysts assume so, in which case there could also be a wave of claims from consumers who were encouraged to buy VW vehicles on the basis of bogus claims about fuel efficiency. Analysts at Exane BNP Paribas, for example, added \u20ac4bn for recall and compensation costs for customers. That assumption sounds fair. The point, though, is that VW ought to be able say what its \u20ac2bn covers and what it doesn\u2019t.</p> <p>Sadly, though, whatever M\u00fcller says about following a \u201cpath of clarification and transparency\u201d, ambiguity has been the hallmark of VW\u2019s statements for the past month. If that\u2019s the approach, outsiders will naturally assume this scandal could become substantially worse. </p> <p>Germany\u2019s chancellor, Angela Merkel, must be tearing her hair out. She is trying to deflect damage to the country\u2019s industrial and engineering reputation but is obliged to defend, half-heartedly, a VW boardroom that still seems to be in a state of shock.</p> <p>Merkel could help herself by insisting that VW \u2013 a company whose senior ranks are dominated by a cosy-looking alliance of family shareholders, local Saxony officials and trade unionists \u2013 imports some senior independent outsiders to oversee the inquiry. The company\u2019s current crew seems to prefer obfuscation and is making matters worse.</p> <h2>Success for M&amp;S \u2013 after a fashion</h2> <p>Clothing sales down, profit margins up. It\u2019s becoming a regular theme at Marks &amp; Spencer and, for the time being, the mixed bag \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/nov/04/marks-spencer-fashion-and-homes-sales-fall\">yielding a 6% rise in underlying pre-tax profits to \u00a3284m</a> \u2013 should satisfy shareholders.<br></p> <p>M&amp;S is now buying at sharper prices by designing more clothes inhouse and is finding savings in its supply chain. Both ingredients were missing in the early years of Marc Bolland\u2019s reign but, finally, the chief executive is in the expectation-beating game. Last year\u2019s increase in gross margins was 1.9 percentage points and Bolland thinks M&amp;S will beat that figure this year</p> <p>If <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/may/24/rag-trade-brothers-marks-and-spencer-neal-mark-lindsey\">the well-paid Lindsey brothers</a>, Neal and Mark, are responsible for injecting some Next-style rigour into M&amp;S\u2019s sourcing network, they\u2019re earning their keep. When your turnover in general merchandise is \u00a34bn, percentage points matter.</p> <p>Yet a 1.2% fall in like-for-like sales in general merchandise \u2013 indeed, a 1.9% tumble in the second quarter \u2013 can\u2019t be ignored. Remember, these are declines upon declines. Perpetual loss of market share in clothing is not a long-term option for M&amp;S. One day the sagging sales line may have to be confronted head-on by recycling efficiency savings into lower prices for customers.</p> <p>That date with destiny, though, is not now. Today, the M&amp;S arithmetic works. After a long period of heavy capital expenditure, the business is generating lots of cash \u2013 \u00a3256m in the six-month period \u2013 and debt is falling steadily, allowing a 6% hike in the dividend and, presumably, more share buybacks in time. The food division continues its winning ways and only the international side, inevitably hampered by Russia and currencies, is a drag. Bolland deserves more credit than he\u2019s getting.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Has Volkswagen been rigging CO2 emissions tests as well as diesel emissions? That is the implication of the oblique statement released by the German carmaker on Tuesday. VW said it found \u201cirregularities\u201d and \u201cunexplained inconsistencies\u201d in the levels of carbon dioxide emitted by its cars. It admitted that CO2 levels and fuel consumption figures for some models were set too low during the testing process. There were no details about why this happened \u2013 such as whether another defeat device was used \u2013 or the scale of the irregularities. Indeed, VW said the issue was \u201cnot yet fully explained\u201d. However, no matter how it was done, if CO2 emissions were artificially lowered during testing with technology that was not declared to the authorities or does not work the same way on roads then this counts as cheating tests. What Volkswagen cars are affected? About 800,000 VW vehicles are involved. However, the company says this is just an estimate based on current knowledge. The specific models have not yet been officially declared. However, the company has indicated the vehicles have 1.4-litre engines and are mostly Polos and Golfs, although some are Audi, Seat and \u0160koda cars. The majority have diesel engines, but this means for the first time that petrol engines are involved in the emissions rigging scandal. In terms of geography, the German government has said a quarter of the cars are in that country, but that is all that is known so far. How was the latest scandal uncovered? Volkswagen said it uncovered the problem during its internal investigation into the diesel emissions scandal that began in September. It is not clear whether the 800,000 cars involved are part of the 11m VW has admitted were fitted with a defeat device to cheat nitrogen oxide tests, or are a new set of vehicles. The fact that some of the cars involved have petrol engines suggests the latter. How serious is this latest discovery? Very. Volkswagen has said the \u201ceconomic risks\u201d are \u20ac2bn (\u00a31.4bn). This works out as \u20ac2,500 per car, far more than the \u20ac609 per car put aside for the cost of the 11m cars involved in the diesel emissions scandal. Analysts believe these costs mainly relate to the amount VW will have to pay back to governments in tax credits. CO2 emissions are used to set the road duty that vehicles are eligible for, so rigging the tests would mean VW vehicles contributed less in tax than they should have. However, this may only be the start of the costs. VW may have to compensate owners upset that their car consumes more fuel than they thought. This cost is relatively easy for motorists to calculate, because they will be able to work out the total mileage of their car and the difference between the stated fuel economy of their vehicle and its performance. The latest revelation could also have a more damaging impact on the brand than the diesel emissions scandal, because it directly relates to the performance of the vehicle. Shares in VW fell by 10% on Wednesday, with investors in the company clearly spooked about the potential costs. Is this linked to Environmental Protection Agency making new allegations against Volkswagen in the US? No. On Monday, the EPA issued a second notice of violation of the Clean Air Act to VW, claiming that the company used defeat devices in VW, Audi and Porsche vehicles with three-litre diesel engines. The EPA uncovered the initial emissions rigging scandal at VW, but that involved cars with smaller engines. The carmaker has denied using defeat devices in the three-litre vehicles, but is cooperating with the EPA inquiry. What should Volkswagen drivers do now and will there be a cost? VW has said all the 800,000 vehicles are safe and legal to drive, so motorists should carry on as normal for now. VW drivers with one of the 11m vehicles affected by the initial diesel emissions scandal have already been contacted by post and are awaiting details about how the defeat device will be removed. It is likely that VW will eventually formally contact motorists affected by the latest development too, but the company is still attempting to get to the bottom of what has actually happened and what models are involved. Whether the affected cars will need to be repaired is unclear, because there is no absolute upper limit on CO2 emissions. Governments in Europe have already said that VW itself should pay any shortfall in tax income if it turns out that their vehicles were in the wrong tax bracket because they cheated CO2 emissions tests. However, motorists would be able to claim compensation if it turns out their vehicle consumed fuel at a quicker rate than they thought.",

      "bodyText": "Volkswagen could have to repay billions of pounds of tax credits to European governments after finding \u201cirregularities\u201d in the levels of carbon dioxide emitted by its cars. Shares in the embattled carmaker slumped by 10% on Wednesday, wiping \u20ac5bn (\u00a33.5bn) off the value of the company, as analysts warned that the consequences of rigging CO2 and fuel consumption tests could be worse than the initial scandal around diesel emissions tests. VW has now lost \u20ac32.4bn, or 40% of its value, since admitting in September that it installed defeat devices into 11m diesel vehicles. The scandal is dragging down sales of new VW cars, according to industry figures due to be released in Britain on Thursday. Sales data for October from the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders is expected to show that VW sales fell by more than 8% year-on-year, with Seat and \u0160koda also down. The latest admission about CO2 tests dramatically widens the scandal that VW is facing. Germany, Britain and other countries set vehicle tax rates based on their CO2 emissions. This means that if VW artificially lowered CO2 emissions during testing then its vehicles will have contributed far less in tax than they should have. VW has said that at least 800,000 cars are affected by the CO2 discovery and estimated the \u201ceconomic risks\u201d at \u20ac2bn. This works out at \u20ac2,500 per car, far more than the \u20ac609 per car put aside for the cost of the 11m cars involved in the diesel emissions scandal, which was \u20ac6.7bn in total. Analysts said these costs were likely to relate to repaying tax credits in Europe rather than customer compensation. Stuart Pearson, analyst at stockbroker BNP Paribas Exane, said: \u201cVW will likely need to repay CO2-related tax breaks etc to various national governments that its vehicles artificially \u2018earned\u2019. This gives governments a simple mechanism by which to \u2018fine\u2019 VW, without penalising the customer.\u201d Alexander Dobrindt, the German transport minister, gave a clear indication that VW would be forced to repay tax. He said a quarter of the 800,000 vehicles are in Germany. Dobrindt said: \u201cIf these vehicles emit more CO2, over and above the respective limit, that makes a new calculation necessary. \u201cI assume that a solution will be found that doesn\u2019t burden VW customers. I think that VW clearly has a duty and a responsibility to ensure that, regarding these questions, customers face neither extra costs nor effort. \u201cIf they want to win back trust, they must first ensure that the damage is remedied and the customers don\u2019t get stuck with the problem.\u201d Dobrindt said that Germany will now retest the CO2 levels of all VW models. The British government said it was taking the situation \u201cextremely seriously\u201d. A Department for Transport spokesman said: \u201cWe are pressing VW to provide urgent clarity on the situation. The government takes the unacceptable actions of Volkswagen extremely seriously. \u201cThis development underlines the importance of the government\u2019s ongoing investigation to establish the extent to which defeat devices have been used.\u201d VW could also face compensation claims from motorists over the misstatement of their vehicle\u2019s fuel economy. According to BNP Paribas, the cost of compensation to governments and customers could reach \u20ac4bn, on top of the estimated \u20ac12bn cost of rigging nitrogen oxide tests. UBS said the total costs of the scandal, including legal claims, could reach \u20ac35bn. The discovery about the irregularities in CO2 data emerged from VW\u2019s investigation into the diesel emissions scandal. This found that figures for CO2 and fuel consumption were set too low during CO2 tests. VW is yet to confirm which models are involved or how the misstatement occurred. The majority of the cars have a diesel engine, but petrol vehicles have been dragged into the scandal for the first time. The latest revelation piles extra pressure on Matthias M\u00fcller, who was made chief executive in late September after the scandal erupted. David Bailey, professor of industrial strategy at Aston University in the UK, said the money set aside in the latest VW statement might not be enough and that doubts about fuel efficiency risked harming VW\u2019s reputation with motorists. He said: \u201cThe scope for brand damage is greater now. I don\u2019t think most European consumers are particularly bothered about emissions but when it starts to affect fuel economy people start to take notice. \u201cThis was a company that was going for growth and seems to have been willing to cheat to do it. How much more bad news is there going to be?\u201d Greenpeace accused VW of a \u201clitany of lies\u201d. Daniel Moser, mobility campaigner for Greenpeace, said: \u201cVolkswagen is not only risking public health by cheating on NOx emissions standards, the \u2018irregularities\u2019 in the CO2 emissions also show how the company is complicit in and profiting from climate change. This is the final straw for a company that can no longer be trusted.\u201d In the US, VW has ordered dealers to stop selling a collection of 2015 and 2016 luxury models with its three-litre diesel engine after the Environmental Protection Agency accused the company of fitting them with defeat devices. The cars involved include the VW Touareg and the Audi A6, A7, A8, Q5 and Q7.",

Sales data for October from the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders is expected to show that VW sales fell by more than 8% year-on-year, with Seat and \u0160koda also down.</p> <p>The latest admission about CO<sub>2</sub> tests dramatically widens the scandal that VW is facing.</p> <p>Germany, <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/calculate-vehicle-tax-rates\">Britain</a> and other countries set vehicle tax rates based on their CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. This means that if VW artificially lowered CO<sub>2</sub> emissions during testing then its vehicles will have contributed far less in tax than they should have.</p> <p>VW has said that at least 800,000 cars are affected by the CO<sub>2</sub> discovery and estimated the \u201ceconomic risks\u201d at \u20ac2bn. This works out at \u20ac2,500 per car, far more than the \u20ac609 per car put aside for the cost of the 11m cars involved in the diesel emissions scandal, which was \u20ac6.7bn in total.</p> <p>Analysts said these costs were likely to relate to repaying tax credits in Europe rather than customer compensation.</p> <p>Stuart Pearson, analyst at stockbroker BNP Paribas Exane, said: \u201cVW will likely need to repay CO<sub>2</sub>-related tax breaks etc to various national governments that its vehicles artificially \u2018earned\u2019. This gives governments a simple mechanism by which to \u2018fine\u2019 VW, without penalising the customer.\u201d</p> <p>Alexander Dobrindt, the German transport minister, gave a clear indication that VW would be forced to repay tax. He said a quarter of the 800,000 vehicles are in Germany.</p> <p>Dobrindt said: \u201cIf these vehicles emit more CO<sub>2</sub>, over and above the respective limit, that makes a new calculation necessary.</p> <p>\u201cI assume that a solution will be found that doesn\u2019t burden VW customers. I think that VW clearly has a duty and a responsibility to ensure that, regarding these questions, customers face neither extra costs nor effort.<br></p> <p>\u201cIf they want to win back trust, they must first ensure that the damage is remedied and the customers don\u2019t get stuck with the problem.\u201d<br></p> <p>Dobrindt said that Germany will now retest the CO<sub>2</sub> levels of all VW models.</p> <p>The British government said it was taking the situation \u201cextremely seriously\u201d. A Department for Transport spokesman said: \u201cWe are pressing VW to provide urgent clarity on the situation. The government takes the unacceptable actions of Volkswagen extremely seriously.</p> <p>\u201cThis development underlines the importance of the government\u2019s ongoing investigation to establish the extent to which defeat devices have been used.\u201d</p> <p>VW could also face compensation claims from motorists over the misstatement of their vehicle\u2019s fuel economy. According to BNP Paribas, the cost of compensation to governments and customers could reach \u20ac4bn, on top of the estimated \u20ac12bn cost of rigging nitrogen oxide tests. UBS said the total costs of the scandal, including legal claims, could reach \u20ac35bn.</p> <p>The discovery about the irregularities in CO2 data emerged from VW\u2019s investigation into the diesel emissions scandal. This found that figures for CO<sub>2</sub> and fuel consumption were set too low during CO<sub>2</sub> tests.</p> <p>VW is yet to confirm which models are involved or how the misstatement occurred. The majority of the cars have a diesel engine, but petrol vehicles have been dragged into the scandal for the first time.</p> <p>The latest revelation piles extra pressure on Matthias M\u00fcller, who <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/sep/25/volkswagen-appoints-matthias-muller-chief-executive-porsche-vw\">was made chief executive in late September</a> after the scandal erupted.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>David Bailey, professor of industrial strategy at Aston University in the UK, said the money set aside in the latest VW statement might not be enough and that doubts about fuel efficiency risked harming VW\u2019s reputation with motorists.</p> <p>He said: \u201cThe scope for brand damage is greater now. I don\u2019t think most European consumers are particularly bothered about emissions but when it starts to affect fuel economy people start to take notice. <br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>\u201cThis was a company that was going for growth and seems to have been willing to cheat to do it. How much more bad news is there going to be?\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/nov/03/vw-c02-emmission-problems-800000-vehicles\">VW admission suggests cheats went much further than emissions</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Greenpeace accused VW of a \u201clitany of lies\u201d. Daniel Moser, mobility campaigner for Greenpeace, said: \u201cVolkswagen is not only risking public health by cheating on NOx emissions standards, the \u2018irregularities\u2019 in the CO<sub>2</sub> emissions also show how the company is complicit in and profiting from climate change. This is the final straw for a company that can no longer be trusted.\u201d</p> <p>In the US, VW has ordered dealers to stop selling a collection of 2015 and 2016 luxury models with its three-litre diesel engine after the Environmental Protection Agency accused the company of fitting them with defeat devices. The cars involved include the VW Touareg and the Audi A6, A7, A8, Q5 and Q7.</p>",

      "bodyText": "A miniature rescue vehicle designed to carry six heroic dogs and led by a tech-savvy patrol leader will be one of the most popular Christmas toys this year, retail experts have predicted. The truck - aimed at preschool boys and girls - is one of the many toy spinoffs from the popular Canadian and US animated TV series PAW Patrol, launched in the UK this year. Costing \u00a359.99, the PAW Patroller was named by the industry as one of the 12 predicted top selling toys for this Christmas. Others include dolls, lightsabers and playsets linked to more familiar blockbuster films such as Frozen and Star Wars. The Toy Retailers Association (TRA) said on Wednesday that 2015 would be a \u201cvintage year\u201d for toys as it released its annual DreamToys list of forecast top sellers, with three connected to the new Star Wars film The Force Awakens, due to hit cinemas on 18 December. They are the Bladebuilders Jedi Master Lightsaber and the Battle Action Millennium Falcon, both by Hasbro, and Kylo Ren\u2019s Command Shuttle by Lego. The Thunderbirds Interactive Tracy Island Playset has also made the list, alongside favourites such as the Disney Frozen Sing A Long With Elsa doll (\u00a339.99) which was also much sought after by parents and children last year. The list is drawn up by a panel of leading toy retailers in the UK including Argos, Boots, Selfridges, Smyths Toys, The Entertainer, TK Maxx and Toys R Us. Lego\u2019s City Deep Sea Exploration Vessel is also expected to dominate Christmas lists, while for younger, preschool children the Little Live Pets Cleverkeet \u2013 an interactive, singing, talking pet bird \u2013 and character-based toys such as the Shopkins range and Vtech\u2019s Toot Toot Friends will be hugely popular, the TRA predicts. Frederique Tutt, toy industry analyst for the NPD Group, said British retailers were hoping for a record year after tie-ins with the Frozen and Minions films and computer game Minecraft boosted sales by 6% since the start of the year. \u201cWith other licensed merchandise such as Star Wars still to come, the market could expect to grow by over \u00a3100m at retail to reach \u00a33.2bn by the end of the year,\u201d she said. NPD named PAW Patrol as the top new brand in the UK in 2015, while noting that the average spending on children up to the age of 11 had edged up to \u00a3300 - the highest per head in Europe. Sales of Star Wars toys have tripled since the \u201cForce Friday\u201d marketing event on 4 September, while Frozen toy merchandise has more than doubled in sales compared with the same time last year. But Christmas toy sales are still huge, with nearly half of all toy spending taking place in the last three months of the year. Gary Grant, chair of the Dream Toys committee, says: \u201cWhile the blockbuster licences may steal the headlines, it is exciting to see innovation throughout the list, with manufacturers successfully combining this with traditional play.\u201d Another unlikely item on the list, and not for the faint-hearted, is Pie Face - a game of suspense in which people compete not to be the victim slapped in the face with a custard pie. Children are urged to \u201cput some delicious whipped cream from home or the wet sponge on ... and start turning the handles. It could go off at any time!\u201d The TRA\u2019s 2015 list does not exactly mirror the top 10 best-selling toys in the week up to 3 October 2015. That included Lego Minifigures - a snip at just \u00a32.49 - a Star Wars advent calendar, a Nerf gun and Match Attax trading cards.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "National Grid has for the first time used \u201clast resort\u201d emergency powers to tell companies to reduce their electricity usage in an effort to avoid the risk of blackouts. It asked firms to reduce their power demand immediately, issuing a so-called demand-side balancing reserve (DSBR) notice to companies that have signed a contract to say they will take part in the demand reduction scheme. A spokesman said this measure had never been used before, while the grid has previously said it would \u201conly be used as a last resort, after all other actions available in the market have been exhausted\u201d. Earlier on Wednesday, National Grid issued an urgent request for energy companies to make more power available after multiple breakdowns at UK power stations. Power firms were asked to supply an extra 500 megawatts (MW) between 4.30pm and 6pm, a period when power demand surges, with some people still at work and others arriving home and turning the lights on. The owner of Severn power station, Calon Energy, sold electricity to the National Grid at \u00a32,500 per megawatt hour during the afternoon, industry sources confirmed, compared with the typical price at that time of about \u00a360. National Grid issued the original request by sending a \u201cnotification of inadequate system margin\u201d (NISM), a warning that there was not enough power in reserve to keep the lights on in the event of an unforeseen emergency. Shortly before 6pm, National Grid issued a further statement saying suppliers had responded to its urgent request and 40MW of extra power had been ordered, so the NISM had been withdrawn. \u201cThis is one of the routine tools that we use to indicate to the market that we would like more generation to come forward for the evening peak demand period,\u201d the company said. \u201cThe issuing of a NISM does not mean we were at risk of blackouts. It means that we needed the safety cushion of power in reserve to be higher.\u201d A NISM is not the strongest warning National Grid can issue. It falls below a high risk of demand reduction (HRDR) and the highest level, a demand control imminent (DCI) warning. Although it insisted there was no threat of imminent power cuts, this was the first NISM to be issued by National Grid since 2012; there were 10 in 2005 and eight in 2008. At the time it issued the NISM notice, National Grid was forecasting peak demand for Wednesday night to be 48,275MW. The company initially played down the significance of the NISM, but it later used the DSBR, which is targeted at large energy users who volunteer to reduce their energy demand in exchange for a payment. Energy analysts at the stockbroker Jefferies said that while the National Grid\u2019s warning could have been just \u201cone of those things\u201d, it could be a sign of system stress as coal-fired power stations close. \u201cIt is self-evident that the UK power system is under increasing stress. Eventually that stress will manifest itself via security-of-supply events,\u201d the company said in a note. The disruption will add to fears that a particularly cold winter could trigger power cuts, damaging the economy and leaving people in the cold. National Grid said last month it had the right tools to avoid blackouts this winter, which has been predicted to be unusually cold. Its contingency plans include the DSBR and the supplemental balancing reserve (SBR), asking energy companies to keep mothballed power plants on standby. The company said on Tuesday that its chief executive was stepping down after 10 years. Steve Holliday will be replaced by National Grid\u2019s UK executive director, John Pettigrew. This article was amended on 5 November and 6 November 2015. Earlier versions said \u201cSevern Trent\u201d, later amended to \u201cSevern Power\u201d, had sold electricity to the National Grid at \u00a32,500 per megawatt hour on Wednesday.",

This was further proof that European countries are competing with each other by offering a variety of creative tax measures, thus depriving other countries of important parts of their due tax revenues \u2013 and lowering total tax revenues across the whole of Europe. This is money that countries could have used for public services, healthcare or schools. One year has passed and still no ambitious measures at European level have been agreed upon. Across Europe, governments are failing their citizens, who suffer from weaker public services and higher taxes on labour, consumption and income, and their SMEs, which cannot, like many multinationals, hire expensive tax firms and artificially design their businesses in order to lower their tax rates and, as a consequence, face unfair competition. Strong and effective action is urgently needed; business as usual is not an option. The European Union should ensure that multinationals pay their taxes where they make their profits. We strongly advocate for ambitious reforms to clamp down on tax fraud, close legal loopholes, effectively sanction tax havens, fight corruption and money-laundering, and improve transparency and cross-border cooperation. Specifically, we call on EU member states and the European commission to support the obligation for public country-by-country reporting. This measure would oblige listed companies to make public their activities and the taxes they pay in each country in which they operate, in order to allow tax authorities, investors and all stakeholders to properly assess their activities and tax strategies and to take action in case of inappropriate or illicit corporate behaviour.

    "webTitle": "Janet Yellen says December interest rate hike is still on the table", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "A December interest rate increase is still on the table, US Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen said Wednesday during testimony before the House financial services committee. Asked by New York congresswoman Carolyn Maloney, a Democrat, whether the risk of raising rates in December outweigh the benefits, Yellen said that the committee has made no decision yet but that December rate hike was still a \u201clive possibility\u201d. Maloney was not the only member of Congress wondering if the Fed should be more cautious about raising the rates and wait until after December to do so. California congressman Brad Sherman warned Yellen that it is unnatural for things to raise in the fall. \u201cGod\u2019s plan is not for things to rise in the autumn, as a matter of fact, that\u2019s why we call it fall, nor is it God\u2019s plan for things to rise in the winter, through the snow,\u201d he told her. \u201cGod\u2019s plan is that things rise in the spring. And so if you want to be good with the Almighty, you might want to delay until May.\u201d Yellen\u2019s testimony comes exactly a week after the Federal Reserve chose not to raise interest rates in October. \u201cAt this point, I see the US economy as performing well. Domestic spending has been growing at a solid pace,\u201d Yellen said. She added, however, that trade performance and net exports are soft and that there has been a slowdown in job gains recently. The US economy added 64,000 fewer jobs in September than expected. \u201cInflation is, as you mentioned, running considerably below our 2% objective. Nevertheless, the committee judges that an important reason for that is the declines in energy prices and the prices of non-energy imports,\u201d Yellen told Maloney. (Crude oil prices were falling on Wednesday morning after a brief rally early in the week.) \u201cAs those matters stabilize, inflation will move back to our 2% target. With this economic backdrop in mind, the committee indicated in our most recent statement that it could be appropriate to adjust rates in our next meeting.\u201d During her testimony, Yellen went on to add that \u201cno decision has been made on that\u201d and that it will depend on the data assessed by the committee before it meets in December. That includes two more jobs reports, one of which will be released this coming Friday. \u201cWhat the committee has been expecting is that the economy will continue to grow at a pace that\u2019s sufficient to generate further improvements in the labor market and to return inflation to our 2% target over the medium term,\u201d said Yellen. \u201cIf the incoming information supports that expectation, then our statement indicates that December would be a live possibility, but, importantly, that we have made no decisions about it.\u201d William C Dudley, vice-chairman and a member of the Federal Open Market Committee which determines whether interest rake is necessary, echoed Yellen\u2019s remarks, saying: \u201cI fully agree with the chair. It is a live possibility, but let\u2019s see what the data shows.\u201d Yellen added that if the data is there to support a rate hike, such a move would be \u201ca prudent thing to do\u201d because it would allow the Federal Reserve to move at a \u201cgradual and measured pace\u201d.",

      "body": "<p>A December interest rate increase is still on the table, US Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen said Wednesday during testimony before the House financial services committee. </p> <p>Asked by New York congresswoman Carolyn Maloney, a Democrat, whether the risk of raising rates in December outweigh the benefits, Yellen said that the committee has made no decision yet but that December rate hike was still a \u201clive possibility\u201d. </p> <p>Maloney was not the only member of Congress wondering if the Fed should be more cautious about raising the rates and wait until after December to do so. California congressman Brad Sherman warned Yellen that it is unnatural for things to raise in the fall.</p> <p>\u201cGod\u2019s plan is not for things to rise in the autumn, as a matter of fact, that\u2019s why we call it fall, nor is it God\u2019s plan for things to rise in the winter, through the snow,\u201d <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-11-04/god-wants-yellen-to-delay-rate-hike-until-spring-lawmaker-says\">he told her</a>. \u201cGod\u2019s plan is that things rise in the spring. And so if you want to be good with the Almighty, you might want to delay until May.\u201d</p> <p>Yellen\u2019s testimony comes exactly a week after the Federal Reserve <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/oct/28/federal-reserve-interest-rates-unchanged\">chose not to raise interest rates</a> in October. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/oct/28/federal-reserve-interest-rates-unchanged\">Federal Reserve keeps interest rates unchanged but hints at December rise</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cAt this point, I see the US economy as performing well. Domestic spending has been growing at a solid pace,\u201d Yellen said. She added, however, that trade performance and net exports are soft and that there has been a slowdown in job gains recently. The US economy added <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/oct/02/us-economy-adds-only-142000-jobs-raising-doubts-about-interest-rate-rise\">64,000 fewer jobs in September</a> than expected. </p> <p>\u201cInflation is, as you mentioned, running considerably below our 2% objective. Nevertheless, the committee judges that an important reason for that is the declines in energy prices and the prices of non-energy imports,\u201d Yellen told Maloney. (Crude oil prices were falling on Wednesday morning after a brief rally early in the week.) \u201cAs those matters stabilize, inflation will move back to our 2% target. With this economic backdrop in mind, the committee indicated in our most recent statement that it could be appropriate to adjust rates in our next meeting.\u201d</p> <p>During her testimony, Yellen went on to add that \u201cno decision has been made on that\u201d and that it will depend on the data assessed by the committee before it meets in December. That includes two more jobs reports, one of which will be released this coming Friday. </p> <p>\u201cWhat the committee has been expecting is that the economy will continue to grow at a pace that\u2019s sufficient to generate further improvements in the labor market and to return inflation to our 2% target over the medium term,\u201d said Yellen. \u201cIf the incoming information supports that expectation, then our statement indicates that December would be a live possibility, but, importantly, that we have made no decisions about it.\u201d <br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/boes_/statuses/661996303279353858\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Bill Dudley on December liftoff: &quot;I fully agree with the Chair.

      "bodyText": "The latest revelations from Volkswagen, this time involving \u201cirregularities\u201d in the levels of carbon dioxide emitted by 800,000 of its cars, have seen its shares slump once more. They closed down 9.5% at \u20ac100.45 , wiping nearly \u20ac5bn off its market value today. This is more than twice as much as the \u20ac2bn as it admitted the new problem would cost it. Since the crisis began VW has lost nearly \u20ac30bn of value. VW\u2019s slide helped push Germany\u2019s Dax down nearly 1% by the close on a day when most other European markets edged higher. However some of the shine came off markets after an opening fall on Wall Street. Stronger than expected US data - the ADP montly employment report showed more jobs were added than expected ahead of Friday\u2019s key non-farm payrolls numbers - along with comments from Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen that an interest rate hike was a live possibility in December pushed American shares lower. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished 29.27 points or 0.46% higher at 6412.88 Germany\u2019s Dax dropped 0.97% to 10,845.24 France\u2019s Cac closed up 0.25% at 4948.29 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB dipped 0.65% to 22,312.63 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended up 0.08% at 10,473.5 In Greece, the Athens market slipped 1.33% to 708.59 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 52 points or 0.29%. On that note, it\u2019s time to close up for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. Volkswagen has old US and Canadian dealers to stop selling recent models equipped with 3.0 V6 TDI diesel engines, Reuters reports: The stop-sale order follows a notice by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency that VW group brands had installed illegal devices on some 3.0 V6 diesel models. VW and Audi dealers were ordered to stop selling new 2015-2016 models with the 3.0 V6 TDI, including the VW Touareg and the Audi A6, A7, A8, Q5 and Q7. VW said pre-owned models from 2013-2014 are included in stop-sale order to dealer. Moody\u2019s has downgraded VW\u2019s credit rating to A3 from A2 with a negative outlook following the latest irregularities. It said the downgrade reflected the view that the emissions issue would have adverse effects on the company\u2019s future earnings and cashflow. Moody\u2019s senior credit officer Yasmina Serghini said: Today\u2019s downgrade reflects mounting risks to Volkswagen\u2019s reputation and future earnings following its announcement on 3 November regarding irregularities in CO2 and fuel consumption levels for certain Volkswagen group vehicles, as well as fresh allegations from the US EPA on 2 November that defeat devices were also installed in certain Audi, Porsche and Volkswagen Touareg models in the US,. These new claims pose further challenges to Volkswagen\u2019s financial flexibility and competitive position, and heighten Moody\u2019s concerns about Volkswagen\u2019s internal control and governance issues, thus further weakening its rating profile. German transport minister Dobrindt says a total of 200,000 cars with the wrong CO2 emissions data could be on the country\u2019s roads, and for these vehicles the car tax may need to be adjusted. He said there would be checks on VW, Audi, Seat and Skoda brands. Earlier he said 98,000 of these could be cars with petrol engines. In total VW has said 800,000 cars could be affected by this latest development in the emissions scandal engulfing the company. The UK Department of Transport is calling on VW to clarify these latest \u201cunacceptable\u201d actions. A spokesperson said: We are pressing VW to provide urgent clarity on the situation. The government takes the unacceptable actions of Volkswagen extremely seriously. This development underlines the importance of the government\u2019s ongoing investigation to establish the extent to which defeat devices have been used. The real cost of VW\u2019s latest admission is likely to be far higher than the company has estimated, as trust in the business breaks down, says professor Andre Spicer at Cass Business School: [The CO2 revelations] will add an additional \u20ac2bn to its already mounting bill. But the real costs will come from the further damage to its brand. Customers will start asking questions: \u2018Is my car more polluting than I thought? Are VW\u2019s cars less fuel efficient than advertised? What else haven\u2019t they told us?\u2019 Markets for complex products like cars run on trust \u2013 there is a huge imbalance of expertise between the engineers who build cars and the people who buy them. Consumers trust companies like VW to give them the best deal. That is why people buy their products. If this trust breaks down, customers could start see the organisation as untrustworthy. The market for VWs could easily turn into what economists call \u2018a market for lemons\u2019 \u2013 that is a marketplace where there are huge imbalances of information and customers are routinely suspicious of what sellers have on offer. This suspicion is likely to spread to other brands as consumers start to treat technical details as reliable as the fanciful car advertisements seen on television: they might make us feel good, but they don\u2019t describe reality. The problem with calls for transparency is that Volkswagen has built a culture for decades which has encouraged a lack of transparency. Building a culture of transparency is going to take time. It will be under pressure to overhaul its corporate governance system, but establishing effective oversight is unlikely to be enough. What is needed is effective undersight \u2013 giving lower level employees the chance to speak up if something goes wrong again in the future. Around 98,000 VW petrol cars in Germany are affected by the latest disclosures, the country\u2019s transport minister Alexander Dobrindt has told parliament. He said (Reuters reports): Today we were told that among the affected vehicles are 98.000 petrol vehicles. VW said late on Tuesday that it had understated the level of carbon dioxide emissions in up to 800,000 cars sold in Europe. Time for a quick recap of the Volkswagen scandal, after a busy few hours: 1) Volkswagen could be forced to pay billions of pounds to European governments in tax credits after admitting it had found \u201cirregularities\u201d in the levels of carbon dioxide emitted by 800,000 of its cars. Analysts believe VW will be hit with the bill, because drivers enjoyed unfairly low car duty rates based on CO2 test statistics. 2) Lawyers have warned that customers are already suffering from the crisis, which has forced down the resale cost of their vehicles. VW owners could also face unexpectedly higher costs in the future, if their cars are rerated at a higher emissions level. 3) Angela Merkel\u2019s office has urged VW\u2019s management to clear the scandal up, and provide the transparency it promised. Economy minister Sigmar Gabriel has offered the embattled auto firm some support, though, saying it deserved credit for reporting the CO2 problems. 4) Shares in VW have slumped on the Frankfurt stock market today, currently down almost 9%. That wipes around \u20ac5bn off the company\u2019s market capitalisation. VW has lost more than one-third of its value since the scandal broke in mid-September. 5) Analysts have warned that the crisis could still escalate. Exane BNP Paribas fears that VW could suffer a \u201charsher commercial impact\u201d, now it has admitted problems with fuel efficiency figures. UBS has estimated that the total cost of the emissions crisis could hit \u20ac35bn And Ipek Ozkardeskaya, analyst at London Capital Group, says Germany\u2019s image has also been badly damaged by the scandal. The Volkswagen scandal has reached India. The Delhi government has issued a notice to the carmaker today, after finding \u201csignificant variations\u201d in the German carmaker\u2019s diesel car emissions. Reuters has the story: The government has asked Volkswagen to respond to the notice in 30 days, Ambuj Sharma, additional secretary in the ministry of heavy industries, said. Volkswagen could face fines or recall if the company is found guilty of violating the emission norms. Volkswagen\u2019s India unit said in a statement it had received a notice from Automotive Research Association of India (ARAI), the country\u2019s testing agency, and would submit its response by November 30. This relates to the first phase of the scandal, involving diesel vehicles emitting excessive NOx gases, rather than the new problems around CO2 and fuel efficiency. German Chancellor Angela Merkel\u2019s spokesman has weighed in, urging Volkswagen to clear the scandal up. Steffen Seibert pointedly told reporters that VW must deliver on its pledge to explain exactly what has happened, and fix it. The AFP newswire has the details: \u201cThe government believes the accusations are serious and that Volkswagen has a duty to transparently and fully clear them up\u201d, said Steffen Seibert, adding that \u201cVolkswagen has made this promise.\u201d Seibert said the government still stood by Merkel\u2019s earlier statement that the scandal would not inflict lasting damage on the reputation of Germany industry. Merkel on Tuesday insisted that the affair would not tarnish Germany\u2019s pristine engineering image, adding that \u201cwe must insist on transparency and a rapid investigation. And my assumption is that those involved will do that.\u201d David Bailey, professor of industrial strategy at Aston University in the UK, believes the problems with Volkswagen\u2019s fuel efficiency could hurt its reputation badly: He said: \u201cThe scope for brand damage is greater now. I don\u2019t think most European consumers are particularly bothered about emissions but when it starts to affect fuel economy people start to take notice. \u201cThis was a company that was going for growth and seems to have been willing to cheat to do it. How much more bad news is there going to be?\u201d Volkswagen could be forced to compensate customers if it transpires that their vehicles have burned through more fuel than promised. That would be on top of any compensation handed to governments because VW cars incurred too little tax. My colleague Graham Ruddick explains: Volkswagen has said the \u201ceconomic risks\u201d are \u20ac2bn (\u00a31.4bn). This works out as \u20ac2,500 per car, far more than the \u20ac609 per car put aside for the cost of the 11m cars involved in the diesel emissions scandal. Analysts believe these costs relates to the amount VW will have to pay back to governments in tax credits. CO2 emissions are used to set the road duty that vehicles are eligible for, so rigging the tests would mean VW vehicles contributed less in tax than they should have. However, this may only be the start of the costs. VW may have to compensate owners upset that their car consumes more fuel than they thought. The latest revelation could also have a more damaging impact on the brand than the diesel emissions scandal, because it directly relates to the performance of the vehicle. There are more details in Graham\u2019s new Q&amp;A: Breaking away from Volkswagen briefly, construction machinery giant JCB has joined the ranks of manufacturing companies announcing UK job cuts. The diggers and excavators firm warned that 290 positions could be lost across its 11 plants, due to a \u201crapid deterioration\u201d in global construction equipment markets. It\u2019s on top of 400 layoffs already planned. This comes a day after Michelin announced 860 job cuts in Northern Ireland, and on top of thousands of job cuts in the steel industry. Volkswagen drivers are already being hit in the pocket by the emissions scandal even before these latest problems, according to UK law firm Leigh Day. Leigh Day\u2019s Shazia Yamin says: \u201cVolkswagen have provided very little information about what they intend to do to repair the problem, leaving their customers in limbo whilst the value of their vehicle depreciates. \u201cWe have already had reports of clients who have sold their vehicle for less than they were worth before the scandal broke and those who are currently trying to sell their vehicles and are being offered sums that are below the pre-scandal book price. Yamin also points to the vehicle excise duty issue (explained earlier): \u201cThe announcement that the CO2 emission and fuel consumption levels may have been manipulated in both petrol and diesel cars will spell further trouble for UK consumers, particularly as vehicle excise duty is calculated based on either engine size or fuel type and CO2 emissions. Leigh Day are already representing over 7000 Volkswagen customers who are seeking compensation after it admitted installing software on 11 million cars to fool emissions tests. Nicolas Ziegelasch, head of equity research at stockbrokers Killik &amp; Co, argues strongly against investing in Volkswagen right now. He says: As official fuel consumption figures were also set too low, there is risk of backlash from consumers, and current owners may well claim damages. The group estimates the economic impact at \u20ac2bn. With the continued uncertainty around these issues and the potential long-term cost, we believe that VW remains uninvestable and that the issue is likely to spread across the industry. Volkswagen still enjoys the support of Germany\u2019s economy minister, who has just thrown his support behind the company. Speaking in Berlin, Sigmar Gabriel argued that VW should get credit for reporting these problems with CO2 emissions and fuel efficiency levels itself. Gabriel told reporters: \u201cVolkswagen has flagged the CO2 issue itself, that shows the company is serious about transparency.\u201d Up to a point, I\u2019d suggest. Regulators across the globe are kicking the tires of VW models, so any problems will surely come to light eventually. VW didn\u2019t really have much choice.... A quick reminder of how the VW scandal has unfolded over the last six weeks: Volkswagen couldn\u2019t have picked a worse time to admit it might have cheated CO2 tests. Adam Vaughan, editor of the Guardian\u2019s environment site, explains: At the end of the month, world leaders including Barack Obama, Xi Jinping, David Cameron and Narendra Modi will join a summit in Paris to \u2018save the world\u2019 from dangerous global warming. Central to any deal is cutting carbon emissions, so the news that 800,000 cars have potentially emitted more carbon will be as welcome as a coal company at the talks. Only yesterday, the UN\u2019s top climate change official said the VW emissions scandal was a blessing in disguise because it\u2019d hasten the switch to lower carbon vehicles. Asked if she thought the scandal undermined the car industry, Christiana Figueres said: \u201cNo, I am actually delighted about Volkswagen. ... what is their corporate strategy? We are going to scrap diesel and move to electric vehicles.\u201d She might take a different view this morning, now the affair has spread to CO2 too. Ipek Ozkardeskaya, analyst at London Capital Group, says investors have \u201cretreated to the side-lines\u201d to wait for the thunderstorm over VW to calm down. She writes: The image of German precision, strength, security and reliance are equally damaged. At this stage, it is very difficult to value the goodwill of Volkswagen. There\u2019s no relief in Frankfurt either, with VW shares still down almost 10% today: Shares in France\u2019s largest carmakers, Renault and Peugeot, both fell around 1%. Ipek, though, reckons they should benefit from Volkswagen\u2019s woes: The glass may well be half-full for VW competitors, as they certainly have a good market share to grasp as a significant number of VW consumers will likely walk away from VW galleries. At least for the next couple of years. Analysts at UBS reckon this scandal could cost Volkswagen as much as \u20ac35bn - or two-thirds of its current market value. They write: We continue to appreciate the speed and thoroughness demonstrated by new CEO Matthias M\u0171ller in dealing with these issues, and have estimated product fixing costs as high as \u20ac10bn in addition to litigation and fines (for a total \u20ac35bn). This development will however certainly add to pressure on VW shares and on-going concerns about costs as well as ethics and governance at the group level. But they also believe VW can handle the crisis: We reiterate our investment case on VW which is largely based on an acceleration of corporate change and we continue to see value in the shares as: (1) our reverse sum of the parts highlights a \u20ac32bn negative value for the group\u2019s volume brands after \u20ac35bn of total fixing and litigation costs and (2) our liquidity analysis suggests the group can cope with a \u20ac35bn outflow over 5+ years without needing to raise capital. Exane BNP Paribas have also created a Q&amp;A on the Volkswagen scandal. Here are some highlights: Do we know which cars in which regions are affected? No. All VW has said is that it is \u2018mainly\u2019 diesel cars that are affected (implying some gasoline also). We do not yet know which regions, brand or models are affected, but given the CO2 type approval nature of the issue, we suspect the bulk of the affected vehicles will be in Europe. Are these cars a subset of the 11m cars affected by the prior NOx issue? This is not clear. However given some vehicles appear to have been gasoline models, they are by definition NOT part of the same 11m recall on NOx that originally sparked the crisis. However a large portion of the 800k CO2 affected cars may well be part of the 11m. Any overlap may help reduce total customer compensation costs. How much did top management know about all this? We may never know. VW has denied that senior management knew of the issue, and outgoing CEO Winterkorn explicitly denied any wrongdoing in his resignation statement. VW has pointed towards a small number of individuals being involved and responsible for developing the \u2018defeat device\u2019 strategy. However press reports are full of speculation of more broad based knowledge of the issue, pointing to warnings from supplier Bosch many years before the scandal broke. However these reports are all unverified, and thus far NO EVIDENCE of any wrongdoing by top management has been discovered (to the best of our knowledge). Could VW\u2019s new CEO, Matthias Mueller, be at risk? Possibly. While Mueller, as former Porsche CEO, is unlikely to have been caught up in the diesel defeat device issue, his handling of the crisis will no doubt come under close scrutiny. The continued lack of information is a considerable frustration to investors, even if VW\u2019s unwillingness to disclose \u2018too much\u2019 is understandable given the legal sensitivity around the case. The deepening crisis at Volkswagen could have a significant impact on future sales, believes Exane BNP Paribas analyst Stuart Pearson. Pearson has also hiked his estimated cost of the scandal, in a research note to clients. He said: \u201cAnother week, another shock in the VW story.\u201d \u201cWe add another \u20ac4bn euros in recall cost and fear a harsher commercial impact.\u201d VW\u2019s share of the European market did fall slightly in September, as the diesel emissions scandal broke. VW\u2019s woes are weighing on the German stock market. Shares in rival carmakers BMW and Daimler are both down this morning, along with tire maker Continental. More than \u20ac4bn has been wiped off Volkswagen\u2019s market capitalisation this morning - which is twice the estimated \u2018economic risk\u2019 of these latest revelations. VW shares have scrambled back slightly, but are still deep in the red, down around 7.5%. The cost of insuring VW\u2019s corporate debt against default has risen this morning. That\u2019s never a good sign for a company, but it\u2019s still below the peak reached in mid-September when the scandal first broke. The \u2018irregularities\u2019 which Volkswagen has discovered around carbon dioxide emissions could have serious tax implications. In Britain, car vehicle tax rates are based on either engine size or fuel type and CO2 emissions. So potentially, VW drivers may have benefitted from unduly low rates -- at the taxman\u2019s expense. The UK government runs a \u2018car fuel data\u2019 web site, where drivers can check the CO2 emission rates and tax bands of thousands of cars, including VW models: That\u2019s just conjecture at this stage - VW haven\u2019t yet said where these cars were sold. But Germany\u2019s motor vehicle tax is also based on CO2 emissions, as is Ireland\u2019s... Here\u2019s Reuters\u2019 early take: Shares in Volkswagen dropped as much as 10% on Wednesday after fresh admissions from the carmaker that it had also overstated fuel-consumption claims and would take a further financial blow of \u20ac2bn ($2.2bn). By 0816 GMT, the shares were trading down 8.8% at \u20ac101.20. Since VW admitted on Sept. 18 it had cheated diesel-emissions tests in the United States, \u20ac24bn have been wiped off its market value. VW\u2019s shares have hit a two week low this morning: (sorry, I forgot they dipped below \u20ac98 in mid-October). This chart shows the share price since August, up to this morning\u2019s tumble: The big plunge came in mid-September, when US regulators broke the news that VW had been cheating on emissions tests. Volkswagen shares have tumbled by nearly 10% at the start of trading in Frankfurt. They have plunged \u20ac11 to hit \u20ac99.95, a one-month low . Traders are rushing to sell the stock, following last night\u2019s admission of \u201cirregularities\u201d in the carbon dioxide levels emitted by 800,000 of its cars. The news that it could include petrol cars is also spooking investors. The head of UBS\u2019s automobile team, Philippe Houchois, says the crisis at Volkswagen has taken a serious turn. He told Bloomberg TV that: You can filter out NOx, but you can\u2019t filter out CO2, so it\u2019s potentially a bigger issue. And that\u2019s because CO2 emissions levels are directly linked to the fuel economy of a vehicle. If a car burns through more gas than officially estimated, it will pump more CO2 out as well. Analysts at Credit Suisse believe that these new revelations around carbon dioxide emissions levels could be more serious for VW than the known problems with NOx levels. They say (via Business Insider): At this point the financial impact from today\u2019s release is unclear, as only limited details have been provided. However, given that that provisions per vehicle are 4.1x higher versus the NOx issue, the magnitude could be much bigger in scale. In our view, today\u2019s announcement could concern those who believe that the economic impact is manageable and more than priced in post the drop in share price.  I suspect it depends whether VW have got to the bottom of the problem yet. Currently, they says the CO2 problems (estimated cost: \u20ac2bn) only affect 800,000 vehicles, compared to the 11 million which contain software to cheat NOx tests (estimated cost: \u20ac6.7bn). The steady stream of bad news from Volkswagen in the last six weeks has stunned some commentators. Arndt Ellinghorst, a London-based analyst with Evercore ISI, told Bloomberg: \u201cVW is leaving us all speechless\u201d. Bloomberg also has some information about the cars whose CO2 emissions are now being questioned: Volkswagen\u2019s Polo, Golf and Passat models are affected as well as the subcompact A1 and the A3 hatchback at the Audi premium brand, a Volkswagen spokesman said by phone. The affected models at other brands include the Skoda Octavia, the Seat Ibiza and the Seat Leon. Volkswagen shares have slumped by over 6% in pre-market trading on the German stock market, as Frankfurt traders digest last night\u2019s news. The market opens at 9am local time, or 8am GMT. The Financial Times has some details about the 800,000 Volkswagen cars which have \u2018irregularities\u2019 in its carbon dioxide levels: The company told the Financial Times that the vehicles affected were \u201cmostly diesels\u201d, although for the first time petrol engines were involved in the scandal. The vehicles\u2019 emissions were understated and fuel economy overstated. The vehicles\u2019 emissions were understated and fuel economy overstated. The vehicles all have 1.4 litre engines \u2014 they are mostly VW Polos and Golfs but some are also Audi, Seat and Skoda cars. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. The crisis at Volkswagen is deepening today, after the German carmaker admitted that even more of its cars had \u201cirregularities\u201d in their emissions levels and fuel consumption figures. For the first time, VW said it had found problems involving carbon dioxide emissions on 800,000 of its vehicles - on top of the 11 million that have been spewing out unacceptably high levels of nitrogen oxides. And it also revealed that petrol engines are involved too, as we reported last night: An internal investigation into the diesel emissions scandal has discovered that CO2 and fuel consumption were also \u201cset too low during the CO2 certification process\u201d, the company admitted on Tuesday night. The dramatic admission raises the prospect that VW not only cheated on diesel emissions tests but CO2 and fuel consumption too. VW said it estimated the \u201ceconomic risks\u201d of the latest discovery at \u20ac2bn (\u00a31.42bn). The company said the \u201cmajority\u201d of cars involved have a diesel engine, which implies that petrol cars are involved in the scandal for the first time. Here\u2019s our full story: These revelations pile more pressure on VW\u2019s management, as new CEO Matthias M\u00fcller tries to get to grips with exactly what\u2019s gone wrong at Germany\u2019s largest carmaker. Stay tuned for the latest developments. Also coming up today.... The global service sector will be in the spotlight this morning, as Markit publishes its latest PMI surveys.

Building a culture of transparency is going to take time. It will be under pressure to overhaul its corporate governance system, but establishing effective oversight is unlikely to be enough.

We do not yet know which regions, brand or models are affected, but given the CO2 type approval nature of the issue, we suspect the bulk of the affected vehicles will be in Europe. </p> </blockquote> <h2>Are these cars a subset of the 11m cars affected by the prior NOx issue? </h2> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>This is not clear. However given some vehicles appear to have been gasoline models, they are by definition NOT part of the same 11m recall on NOx that originally sparked the crisis. However a large portion of the 800k CO2 affected cars may well be part of the 11m. Any overlap may help reduce total customer compensation costs. </p> </blockquote> <h2>How much did top management know about all this? </h2> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We may never know. VW has denied that senior management knew of the issue, and outgoing CEO Winterkorn explicitly denied any wrongdoing in his resignation statement. VW has pointed towards a small number of individuals being involved and responsible for developing the \u2018defeat device\u2019 strategy. However press reports are full of speculation of more broad based knowledge of the issue, pointing to warnings from supplier Bosch many years before the scandal broke.

      "bodyText": "JCB has announced up to 290 job cuts in a move that leaves more than 10% of the workforce at one of Britain\u2019s biggest manufacturers facing redundancy. The construction equipment company, known for its yellow diggers, blamed a rapid slowdown in machine orders worldwide, with the cuts taking place across JCB\u2019s eight Staffordshire factories and in Wrexham. JCB, chaired by the Conservative peer Lord Bamford, had already announced up to 400 job cuts in September from its UK headcount of 6,000. The company is consulting with workers over those cuts and has launched a fresh consultation with the GMB trade union over the latest round of redundancies. Graeme Macdonald, JCB\u2019s chief executive, said: \u201cManufacturers in the construction equipment industry are currently facing very tough trading conditions and we have to react to the current market reality to protect the long-term future of the business. Regrettably, this means taking the very difficult decision to reduce the number of shop-floor positions by up to 290 across the UK.\u201d The last time JCB was forced to cut jobs on this scale was in 2009 during the depths of the global financial crisis. Macdonald, who runs JCB for the billionaire Bamford family, said the global economy shows no sign of improving and that the outlook is challenging. JCB said demand had plunged in Russia and Brazil \u2013 big markets for the company that have been hit by falling oil and commodity prices \u2013 and in China. Previously sturdy growth in the UK and the US weakened over the summer, it added. The job cuts will be a blow to George Osborne because JCB is a star of the manufacturing sector, which the chancellor has championed but is suffering as the global economy slows. The plunge in the price of oil, welcomed by Osborne for bringing increased household spending power, is causing export markets to weaken, hitting UK business. Fears are growing that declining world trade will cause a spate of factory closures in the UK, dashing hopes of an export revival. More than 5,000 steelworkers are facing redundancy in England and Scotland, and 860 jobs will go when Michelin closes its tyre factory in Ballymena, Northern Ireland, announced on Tuesday. Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said: \u201cManufacturing has been in recession for the last three quarters and job losses at JCB fit into that story. The UK\u2019s economic recovery is going to slow quite sharply over the next six months or so and weakness in emerging markets and the strong pound will be the key drivers in that slowdown.\u201d JCB is the third biggest maker of construction equipment in the world and exports 75% of its machines to about 140 countries. It contributes \u00a31.4bn a year to British GDP and each of its jobs supports another three in the supply chain, independent analysis has shown. Bamford is also a big Tory donor, contributing more than \u00a32.5m to the party in recent years, and he wrote a report on manufacturing for the government in 2012. Lee Hopley, chief economist at EEF, the manufacturers\u2019 lobby group, said: \u201cThe climate is tough for manufacturers. There are concerns about emerging markets, sluggish demand in Europe and the plummet in the oil price has hit manufacturing supply chains.\u201d JCB is privately owned and takes pride in making decisions for the long run instead of to meet City-imposed targets. It said weakness in countries that depend on oil and commodity exports had affected wider business confidence. Gordon Richardson, the GMB\u2019s JCB convenor, said: \u201cThis news is obviously very disappointing but it has been apparent now for some time that global markets have been declining. Our job as a trade union is to now work hard to formulate a plan to mitigate the impact of the proposed redundancies.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "This year\u2019s general election was the first since 1992 that has failed to spur a recovery in the housing market, according to estate agent Countrywide. The firm said on Wednesday that operating profit in the first nine months of 2015 was down 11%, a result that sent its shares, and those of its notoriously aggressive rival Foxtons, tumbling. Countrywide\u2019s chief executive, Alison Platt, said the industry had been caught napping by an unexpected dearth of people putting their houses on the market. After the last four general elections, she said, \u201cwe\u2019ve seen a consistent pattern that in the few months leading up to it, trading is very constrained. \u201cHistory suggests that post a general election, particularly with a clear outcome, the market would make up for what was lost in the months prior to the election. \u201cWe have not seen that, and Land Registry data suggests the market hasn\u2019t seen it.\u201d Countrywide handed over the keys to just 48,541 homes in the first nine months of the year, 10% below last year\u2019s figure. It expects the overall volume of house sales in the UK to be 950,000 this year, 5% below last year and far beneath the 20-year average of 1.3m. It also pointed to Land Registry data showing that house market volumes were down 8% in July. The gloomy statement sent Countrywide stock down more than 10% to 416.8p, while investors gambled that Foxtons would also suffer, sending its shares down nearly 4% to 192.3p. Platt said part of the problem for estate agents is that rising prices have left young people with little hope of getting on the property ladder. \u201cThe issue about deposits for first-time buyers is well covered. It\u2019s getting harder and harder.\u201d The congestion in the housing market was not helped by a lack of new homes being built, she added. \u201cIf we had more homes coming to market, that would stimulate the market, particularly if we see affordable homes for first-time buyers.\u201d Platt\u2019s comments come after a recent Royal Institute of Chartered Surveyors (Rics) report said demand for homes continued to outstrip supply, exacerbated by homeowners holding fire on sales as property prices rise. Countrywide added that changes to stamp duty introduced by the chancellor have had little effect other than to slow down the upper end of the market. The firm, which floated on the stock market in 2013, expects operating profit for the year to fall below last year\u2019s record earnings of \u00a3121.4m. It will also stop paying a special dividend until 2017, while it tries to hit a target of doubling operating profit to \u00a3250m by 2020. Property analysts at stockbroker Numis Securities warned Countrywide would now struggle to hit that target without a \u201csignificant\u201d housing market recovery. They added that this could spur Countrywide to grow by acquisitions, which \u201cincreases the risk profile of the company\u201d. But Platt said the target still stands. She said she was optimistic about a revival in the housing market next year, adding that growth in residential lettings and financial services could offset any continued stagnation in house sales. She wants Countrywide to increase the proportion of income that does not come from house sales to 50% from about 45%. \u201cWe\u2019re heading in the right direction but for the wrong reasons,\u201d she said, referring to the malaise in house sales tipping the balance towards its lettings and financial services arms. Countrywide also hinted it could sell a stake in property search engine Zoopla worth about \u00a340m.",

      "bodyText": "JD Wetherspoon has warned that increased staff costs were likely to lead to a fall in its full year profits compared to last year. Tim Martin, the outspoken chairman of the 900-strong pubs group, said in its first quarter trading update: As we indicated in September it is difficult to quantify exactly the factors which will influence our trading performance in the early stages of a financial year. Increased labour costs are clearly an important factor for all pub and restaurant companies and may result in our annual profits being slightly lower that the last financial year. Wetherspoons said first quarter like for like sales rose by 2.4% and total sales - including new openings - rose 6.1%. Sales have been slightly higher in the past six weeks, helped by the Rugby World Cup. But margins fell from 7.7% to 6.2% due to increases in rates for hourly paid staff in October 2014 and August 2015, which amounted to 13%. The company will also be one of many affected by the government\u2019s plan to introduce a national living wage from 2017. The warning has sent Wetherspoon\u2019s shares down 35p or 4.5% to 741p. Nick Batram at Peel Hunt moved his recommendation from hold to sell, saying: Wetherspoon released a weak first quarter trading update, with the only silver lining being an improved like for like trading number, if only from the contribution from the Rugby World Cup. Operating margins declined to 6.2% in the first quarter, a 150 basis point decline from the same period in 2015, as a result of higher wage costs. Many will be caught by surprise by the [margin] decline .... The direction may have been expected, but the quantum of the decline will surprise many, especially given the 7.4% margin at the full year 2015 results and no indication from management of this level of margin weakness. There will be more pain to come in April with further wage increases (albeit smaller ones) and, with the ever- increasing competitive market backdrop, there is more downside risk to numbers Management is reticent to offset this [margin decline] with price increases and, with limited options to stave the margin decline, we move to sell and downgrade our 2016 forecast (around 4%), flagging further downside forecast risk if like for likes falter. Elsewhere Enterprise Inns has dropped 2.6p to 103.5p after Deutsche Bank cut its target price from 215p to 150p, albeit still with a buy recommendation: Over the next five years, Enterprise management will be embarking upon one of the most ambitious corporate repositioning strategies we have seen in the pub sector over the past two decades, moving from one to three different business units. The plan is not without execution risk. However, we believe that the estate will be of better quality after the restructuring and that shareholders\u2019 interests will be significantly enhanced by the clearer understanding of where value lies within the portfolio. We have moved away from an net asset value-based target price to one based on a sum-of-the-pubs analysis, which is more representative of the new group structure. enterprise deutsche cuts price target",

Nick Batram at Peel Hunt moved his recommendation from hold to sell, saying:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Wetherspoon released a weak first quarter trading update, with the only silver lining being an improved like for like trading number, if only from the contribution from the Rugby World Cup.

The direction may have been expected, but the quantum of the decline will surprise many, especially given the 7.4% margin at the full year 2015 results and no indication from management of this level of margin weakness. There will be more pain to come in April with further wage increases (albeit smaller ones) and, with the ever- increasing competitive market backdrop, there is more downside risk to numbers</p> <p>Management is reticent to offset this [margin decline] with price increases and, with limited options to stave the margin decline, we move to sell and downgrade our 2016 forecast (around 4%), flagging further downside forecast risk if like for likes falter. </p> </blockquote> <p>Elsewhere <strong>Enterprise Inns</strong> has dropped 2.6p to 103.5p after Deutsche Bank cut its target price from 215p to 150p, albeit still with a buy recommendation:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Over the next five years, Enterprise management will be embarking upon one of the most ambitious corporate repositioning strategies we have seen in the pub sector over the past two decades, moving from one to three different business units.

Glencore, which has been volatile in recent months to say the least, has climbed 7p to 126.45p after the group said it was on track to cut its debt from $30bn to $20bn by the end of 2016. It plans to make further cuts to its copper output amid falling metal prices, reducing production by 455,000 tonnes by the end of 2017. It will save $2.4bn from suspending its final dividend this year and interim payout in 2016, and has agreed to sell future silver output from a mine in Peru for $900m in cash to Silver Wheaton. It is also negotiating to sell a minority stake in its agricultural business as well as the Lomas Bayas and Cobar copper miners. It added that its trading division had performed better in the third quarter, allowing it to keep its full year earnings target of $2.5bn to $2.6bn for the division. Canaccord Genuity said: We will need to review today\u2019s releases in detail, but we expect that the disposal will please the market, and on the presumption that the reduced production across a number of commodities is a function of adjusting to costs (rather than production problems) this will also be welcomed. Overall today\u2019s releases should be treated positively by the market. Elsewhere in the sector Anglo American has added 30.7p to 592.6p and BHP Billition 27.5p to \u00a310.86 after comments from China. Tony Cross at Trustnet Direct said: Miners are very much leading the charge for London in the day\u2019s early trading, with Glencore at the top of the FTSE-100 off the back of this morning\u2019s update, whilst the sector as a whole found cheer off the back of what are being seen as supportive comments from China. The president has made \u2018economy-friendly\u2019 comments, along with proposals for financial market reform, which is again certainly helping add to the general feel-good factor. Marks and Spencer is up 16.5p at 537p in a positive reaction to its results. But housebuilders continued their falls. On Tuesday a negative note from Liberum did the damage. And despite positive trading comments from Persimmon, which said it expected to continue generating strong growth, the sector is under pressure once more. Persimmon is down 52p at \u00a318.69 while Taylor Wimpey is 5.6p lower at 182.1p and Barratt Development has lost 16.5p to 570p. On Persimmon Liberum issued a sell note, saying: The sell recommendation rests on a view that gross margins are likely to come off in future as the FPC plays a part in moderating house price inflation, on which Persimmon says \u201cwill support a more stable and sustainable outlook for the housing market\u201d. Overall the FTSE 100 is currently up 53.27 points at 6436.88, helped by a rebound in the UK services sector.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Marks &amp; Spencer\u2019s chief has warned of a \u201cspiky\u201d runup to Christmas, as Black Friday puts shoppers in the mood for discounts after a slowdown in clothing sales last summer. Marc Bolland blamed unseasonal weather and a refusal to engage in widespread high street discounting in August and September for a fall in clothing and homeware sales over the last three months. On Wednesday, the company revealed a 1.9% slide in sales of general merchandise at established stores in the three months to 26 September, compared with a 0.4% decline in the previous quarter. Bolland said: \u201cThe market has been spiky on promotions and will be again with Black Friday and other things coming up ... We felt [this past] quarter was a really difficult quarter to trade and it might be that Christmas is a little bit more difficult.\u201d There was better news at M&amp;S\u2019s food division, where sales at established stores rose 0.2% in the second quarter compared with a 0.3% rise in the previous three months. International sales slumped 2.4% amid political and economic problems in Russia, Turkey and Ukraine as well as currency exchange issues in Europe, which affected performance in Ireland and the Czech Republic. However, underlying pre-tax profit in the six months to the end of September increased 6.1% to \u00a3284m, above expectations, as the company raised its profit margins on clothing and cut back on investment. Shares in the retailer closed 2.8% up at 535p on Wednesday as the company said it had increased the first-half dividend by 6.3% to 6.8p. Bolland insisted the company was putting the right clothing styles into its stores and quality was improving as it benefited from designing more products in-house and buying directly from suppliers. \u201cWe are really having strong reviews internally and with customers who indicated this quarter that our style credentials are up 2%. That\u2019s an important number. Our styles are right and we have had a number of styles over the half year which have been very prominent in the fashion media,\u201d he said. Bolland blamed the poor summer weather for a difficult sales period in August and September and said this had affected the whole high street. He said the company had chosen to \u201chold our breath and say we make sure we deliver our gross margin\u201d by maintaining prices, rather than joining in with widespread discounting in September. However, the company data showed M&amp;S invested slightly more money in discounting over the half year and made all its profit-margin gains on clothing from better deals with suppliers. Richard Hyman, a retail analyst, said: \u201cThe City will be delighted with the margin gains and the M&amp;S share price today shows where it places its emphasis. Back in the real world, the clue to real significance is in the definition of the word retailing \u2013 it\u2019s all about selling product.\u201d Bolland admitted M&amp;S had lost market share in clothing over the period. He said this was partly because the company had not increased store space while key rivals continued to open 4-5% more square footage a year. Underlying sales in M&amp;S\u2019s high street stores were falling by more than 6% as shoppers switched to its now improved online service, the chief executive said. Sales of clothing and homewares online rose 34.2% over the half year as after resolving a series of glitches which hampered performance in 2014. M&amp;S said market conditions remained challenging but it was \u201cwell set up\u201d for Christmas and was confident it would cope with a surge in demand on the Black Friday sales event at the end of November, having learned lessons from problems at its hi-tech distribution centre over the busy discount day last year. Bolland said M&amp;S was outpacing its bigger rivals in the food market by up to 4%. Profit margins on food slipped, triggered by an increase in the amount of food wasted over the summer as wet weather stopped customers from buying barbecue food, M&amp;S said. Helen Weir, finance director, said the company was not expecting further issues with seasonal food products in the coming three months. \u201cChristmas is always going to come, whereas those sunny weekends didn\u2019t always arrive in the summer,\u201d she said. Clive Black, an analyst at Shore Capital, said: \u201cM&amp;S struggles to drive its top line for a\u200e variety of reasons, some of which are quite understandable, such as the barriers to trade in a number of its international markets, while others are more troublesome, most particularly the inability to engineer sustained traction in its UK general merchandise division.\u201d",

We felt [this past] quarter was a really difficult quarter to trade and it might be that Christmas is a little bit more difficult.\u201d</p> <p>There was better news at M&amp;S\u2019s food division, where sales at established stores rose 0.2% in the second quarter compared with a 0.3% rise in the previous three months. International sales slumped 2.4% amid political and economic problems in Russia, Turkey and Ukraine as well as currency exchange issues in Europe, which affected performance in Ireland and the Czech Republic.</p> <p>However, underlying pre-tax profit in the six months to the end of September increased 6.1% to \u00a3284m, above expectations, as the company raised its profit margins on clothing and cut back on investment. Shares in the retailer closed 2.8% up at 535p on Wednesday as the company said it had increased the first-half dividend by 6.3% to 6.8p.</p> <p>Bolland insisted the company was putting the right clothing styles into its stores and quality was improving as it benefited from designing more products in-house and buying directly from suppliers.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"937d8ea2310d4dbef6af5c571225487ffaae403f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/937d8ea2310d4dbef6af5c571225487ffaae403f/0_0_3200_1921/1000.jpg\" alt=\"M&amp;S chief Marc Bolland.

That\u2019s an important number. Our styles are right and we have had a number of styles over the half year which have been very prominent in the fashion media,\u201d he said.<br></p> <p>Bolland blamed the poor summer weather for a difficult sales period in August and September and said this had affected the whole high street. He said the company had chosen to \u201chold our breath and say we make sure we deliver our gross margin\u201d by maintaining prices, rather than joining in with widespread discounting in September.</p> <p>However, the company data showed M&amp;S invested slightly more money in discounting over the half year and made all its profit-margin gains on clothing from better deals with suppliers.</p> <p>Richard Hyman, a retail analyst, said: \u201cThe City will be delighted with the margin gains and the M&amp;S share price today shows where it places its emphasis. Back in the real world, the clue to real significance is in the definition of the word retailing \u2013 it\u2019s all about selling product.\u201d</p> <p>Bolland admitted M&amp;S had lost market share in clothing over the period. He said this was partly because the company had not increased store space while key rivals continued to open 4-5% more square footage a year. </p> <p>Underlying sales in M&amp;S\u2019s high street stores were falling by more than 6% as shoppers switched to its now improved online service, the chief executive said. Sales of clothing and homewares online rose 34.2% over the half year as after resolving a series of glitches which hampered performance in 2014.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d675f6a9f65aee5ad5870935e0ad8f7d3381717f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d675f6a9f65aee5ad5870935e0ad8f7d3381717f/0_0_5150_3093/1000.jpg\" alt=\"M&amp;S says it remains confident despite challenging conditions.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"601\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">M&amp;S says it remains confident despite challenging conditions.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>M&amp;S said market conditions remained challenging but it was \u201cwell set up\u201d for Christmas and was confident it would cope with a surge in demand on the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/jan/05/john-lewis-boss-says-rein-in-black-friday\">Black Friday sales event at the end of November</a>, having learned lessons from problems at its hi-tech distribution centre over the busy discount day last year.</p> <p>Bolland said M&amp;S was outpacing its bigger rivals in the food market by up to 4%. </p> <p>Profit margins on food slipped, triggered by an increase in the amount of food wasted over the summer as wet weather stopped customers from buying barbecue food, M&amp;S said.</p> <p>Helen Weir, finance director, said the company was not expecting further issues with seasonal food products in the coming three months. \u201cChristmas is always going to come, whereas those sunny weekends didn\u2019t always arrive in the summer,\u201d she said.<br></p> <p>Clive Black, an analyst at Shore Capital, said: \u201cM&amp;S struggles to drive its top line for a\u200e variety of reasons, some of which are quite understandable, such as the barriers to trade in a number of its international markets, while others are more troublesome, most particularly the inability to engineer sustained traction in its UK general merchandise division.\u201d<br></p>",

    "webTitle": "City execs' bonuses should be tied to gender balance targets \u2013 report", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The bonuses of City executives should be linked to whether or not they meet targets for the number of senior women appointed at a firm, according to a government-backed report. The review of women in finance, led by the chief executive of Virgin Money, Jayne-Anne Gadhia, also recommended on Wednesday that financial services firms should report publicly on their gender diversity. It said they should appoint an executive responsible for gender, diversity and inclusion. The proposal to make part of the pay packages of a firm\u2019s executive team dependent on its gender balance is one of Gadhia\u2019s preliminary recommendations. She argues that businesses will increase productivity and improve results by encouraging more women into senior roles. Gadhia said: \u201cIt should be a wake-up call to everyone in financial services that fewer women progress to senior levels than in any other industry in the UK. There are many views as to why that might be. Motherhood, remuneration, the \u2018old boys\u2019 network\u2019 are all mentioned, but only scratch the surface of an issue that has been hidden for too long.\u201d Her comments come just days after a government-backed review set a new target for Britain\u2019s biggest companies to ensure that at least a third of boardroom positions are held by women by the end of the decade. But the report from Mervyn Davies, who judged that the introduction of legally enforced quotas was not necessary, was criticised for not going far enough. Many companies have been appointing women to non-executive director positions rather than executive roles. A recent paper from Prof Colin P Green and Dr Swarnodeep Homroy at Lancaster University Management School found that appointing women to boards improves the financial performance of the average company by 5%. Researchers looked at data from 152 firms in Europe \u2013 30% from the UK \u2013 between 2004 and 2013. It was only when they focused on women with key committee roles \u2013 audit, nomination and remuneration \u2013 that gains were seen. The OECD has estimated that equalising the role of men and women in the labour market could boost GDP by 12% on average across OECD countries by 2030. But the World Economic Forum estimated in its 2014 global gender gap report that it would take until 2095 to achieve worldwide gender parity in the workplace. Gadhia\u2019s recommendations will be presented at a summit of financial services executives, hosted by the economic secretary to the Treasury, Harriett Baldwin, at 11 Downing Street, to discuss what can be done to increase the numbers of women in senior roles in the City. The recommendations will also be discussed by a panel including the Goldman Sachs executive Michelle Pinggera, the HSBC executive Francesca McDonagh and Dame Amelia Fawcett, who chairs the Hedge Fund Standards Board. The panel will be chaired by Stephanie Flanders, the former BBC economics editor who is now the chief marketing strategist at JP Morgan Asset Management. Baldwin said: \u201cI know that there are a lot of brilliant, talented women out there whose skills would be an enormous asset to any firm. We should be making the most of that talent as all organisations work better when they benefit from a range of perspectives.\u201d Following consultation on the recommendations, Gadhia\u2019s final report will be published ahead of next year\u2019s budget.",

There are many views as to why that might be.

      "bodyText": "Tesco is seeking a new deal with dairy farmers after a chaotic summer for the agriculture industry during which protesters paraded cows around a supermarket. The retailer has written to farmers outlining terms that include reviewing the price it pays every three months rather than every six and ranking suppliers based on their performance, with the worst potentially losing their deals. Matt Simister, Tesco\u2019s commercial director for fresh food and commodities, says in the letter that the agreement is \u201cprogressive, fit for the future and, importantly, one that we can continue to be proud of for many years to come\u201d. The letter is likely to be broadly welcomed by farmers because Tesco stands by its commitment to pay a price for milk based on the cost of production. In the letter, Simister says: \u201cWe believe that working closely with our producers through an independent cost tracker continues to be the fairest and most sustainable way that we can deliver the best quality milk for our customers, whilst maintaining the highest standards of animal welfare.\u201d In August the National Farmers Union said dairy producers were facing a \u201cstate of emergency\u201d after the price they were paid for milk fell by a quarter in a year. Aldi, Lidl, Asda and Morrisons were targeted by protesters because they paid less for milk than Tesco and Sainsbury\u2019s and did not base prices on the cost of production. Cows were paraded through the aisles of an Asda store in Stafford. Tesco launched a review of its agreement with farmers, called the Tesco Sustainable Dairy Group (TSDG), as as part of a drive by the new chief executive, Dave Lewis, to simplify the company\u2019s relationships with suppliers. The new terms will be introduced from 1 February next year. Tesco said updating the price of milk every three months instead of every half-year would allow the price to \u201cbetter reflect actual on-farm costs such as feed, fertiliser, and fuel\u201d. Tesco will also remove a clause that allowed it to shift the price it paid for milk to the wider market price if it was significantly lower. In return, the supermarket wants all farms to submit their accounts to Proma, an independent consultancy, so that it can properly analyse the price to pay for milk. An incentive of 0.5p per litre for farmers that submitted their accounts will also be removed. Tesco will rank its suppliers based on milk quality, animal welfare and environmental standards. The top 5% farmers according to this ranking will be rewarded with an extra order of 100,000 litres of milk a year, while the bottom 5% will be given three months to meet Tesco\u2019s standards or be axed as suppliers. Simister said the ranking system was designed to help make British farming more competitive. He said: \u201cWe believe if we are going to make British agriculture more competitive we need a culture of continuous improvement through the supply chain.\u201d Simister said the agreement was \u201cmore sophisticated\u201d, and he acknowledged that some farmers had endured an \u201cincredibly tough\u201d summer. \u201cThis is not a PR gimmick, it is economically sustainable system that will be there for the long-term,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have a duty that our supply chain is healthy, well-invested and sustainable.\u201d The review was conducted by Tesco bosses along with input from leading dairy processors such as Muller Wiseman and farmers. About 650 farmers are part of the TSDG, making it the biggest farming group in the country.",
