      "bodyText": "The Pensions Regulator has expanded its examination of Sir Philip Green\u2019s business empire by demanding information from Arcadia \u2013 the owner of Topshop, Dorothy Perkins and Miss Selfridge \u2013 about the state of its pension scheme. Lesley Titcomb, the chief executive of the Pensions Regulator (TPR), revealed in a letter to Labour MP Frank Field that the organisation had used a so-called section 72 notice to gain information about the Arcadia pension scheme and will continue to monitor it. Arcadia has a pension deficit of \u00a3151m according to accounts for the year to the end of August 2015, although it is likely to have increased since then due to movements in bond yields. Green and his family received a \u00a31.2bn dividend from Arcadia in 2005. Field, who led a parliamentary investigation into the collapse of BHS, said the state of the Arcadia pension scheme is a \u201cterrible concern\u201d. He said: \u201cWe are pleased to see that the Pensions Regulator has used its powers to demand information from Arcadia about yet another of Sir Philip Green\u2019s pension funds that is going deep into deficit, but it is a terrible concern that it has got to this stage again. Is Sir Philip going to \u2018sort\u2019 this one too?\u201d A section 72 notice is a legal demand from TPR for a party to hand over documents or information relating to a pension scheme. In her letter to Field, Titcomb, who give evidence to MPs on Wednesday about the regulation of pension schemes, said TPR had \u201cno issues\u201d with previous triennial valuations of the Arcadia pension scheme in 2007, 2010 and 2013 but had opened talks with the company and the pension trustees about the latest valuation. Titcomb said: \u201cWe have had separate discussions with the trustees to better understand the schemes\u2019 position with respect to their sponsoring employers. These discussions were supported by the use of section 72 notices seeking information from other parties. \u201cWe continue to monitor the Arcadia schemes on an ongoing basis. We will of course also consider the impact of our discussions and investigation concerning the BHS pension schemes on the employer covenant and position of the Arcadia pension schemes.\u201d TPR has already launched legal proceedings against Green and Dominic Chappell, the former owners of BHS, in an attempt to fill the \u00a3571m black hole in the collapsed retailer\u2019s pension scheme. The regulator is understood to be seeking about \u00a3300m from the billionaire tycoon, who pledged to \u201csort\u201d the problems facing the BHS pension scheme when he appeared in front of MPs in June BHS collapsed into administration in April, leading to the loss of 11,000 jobs. Green controlled the business for 15 years until he sold it to Chappell, a three-time bankrupt, for \u00a31 in March 2015. Green, his family, and other BHS shareholders collected at least \u00a3580m from the retailer, while Chappell\u2019s company Retail Acquisitions was paid an estimated \u00a317m. Field\u2019s parliamentary investigation concluded that BHS had been systematically plundered. In a separate letter \u2013 sent on Monday \u2013 Field has asked Titcomb whether the regulator has the power to secure compensation for a pension scheme by seizing assets rather than making a cash demand. This would raise the prospect of TPR acquiring assets from the Green family, potentially even their \u00a3100m superyacht. Arcadia and Green declined to comment, although he has previously said that Arcadia is profitable \u2013 it generated pre-tax profits of \u00a3151m last year \u2013 and has made regular contributions to its pension scheme. In a further development in the BHS scandal, a report on the progress of the administration of the retailer published by the administrators has revealed a clash with the Pension Protection Fund, the state-backed lifeboat for retirement funds. Duff &amp; Phelps, one of the joint administrators, says in the report that it was \u201cnot imperative at this stage\u201d to liquidate BHS and it risks lowering the amount of cash recovered for creditors and increasing costs. The PPF is pushing for the liquidation to begin by the end of the month and has lined up FRP Advisory to handle it. The PPF has responsibility for the BHS pension scheme and is therefore the biggest creditor. Malcolm Weir, head of restructuring and insolvency at the PPF, commented: \u201cWe are intent on securing the best possible recovery on behalf of the pension schemes from the insolvent company. Given that the company has not traded since August, we believe a liquidator will be able to progress all remaining issues at least as quickly as the current administrators, including the remaining leases and the ongoing investigatory work. \u201cThis will expedite the investigations and reduce costs, it is therefore in the interests of pension scheme members and our levy payers to do this promptly.\u201d",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Discount chains Aldi and Lidl have begun putting up the price of basic groceries, including milk and bananas, as the squeeze from the Brexit-driven fall in the value of the pound hits. The two supermarket companies have raised the price of a four-pint bottle of milk to 99p, from 95p \u2013 a 4% lift, which puts them on a par with Asda and just 1p behind Sainsbury\u2019s, Morrisons and Tesco. A pack of bananas is up to 72p from 68p \u2013 an increase of about 6% \u2013 putting them on a par with the major supermarkets, which sell 1kg of loose bananas for about 68p. The price move on two of the most frequently purchased items marks a step change in the battle between the fast-growing German chains and the UK\u2019s traditional big four supermarkets. It comes as the Aldi and Lidl\u2019s pace of growth has hit a five-year low in the face of price cuts and service improvements at their bigger rivals. Aldi said it was still selling loose bananas for 68p per kg but had changed the way it priced packs of bananas from 68p for a 1kg bag to five bananas for 72p. It said this still made it the cheapest in the market, or 8p less than a five-banana pack at Tesco, which had the lowest prices of the big four. However, industry insiders said the move meant Aldi was masking an even bigger price rise, as five bananas were likely to weigh less than 700g. Lidl has simply moved its 1kg bag up in price. \u201cThis shows they are hurting. They have had to move up on price on the single most popular product line in any supermarket,\u201d one industry source said. Most traditional supermarket chains price their loose bananas, which shoppers compare closely with their competitors, slightly more cheaply than bagged bananas. Before changing its packs, Aldi would have been cheaper than other supermarkets\u2019 loose bananas. Now they are on a par with the more expensive bags. \u201cGone are the days when Aldi and Lidl can respond to every price cut by the supermarkets with an equally big price cut,\u201d said Bruno Monteyne, an analyst at Bernstein Research, who suggested the supermarket price war was going into reverse. \u201cDiscounters raising their prices upwards to the same or higher price levels than the supermarkets on the most important food products is surely a huge leap forward.\u201d He said that Tesco had moved to match discounters on about 200 products and it was now too expensive for them to respond as these key items, including fresh produce, made up more than 20% of the German chains\u2019 sales. Matthew Barnes, chief executive officer of Aldi UK and Ireland, said: \u201cWe absolutely guarantee that our customers will always pay the lowest grocery prices in the UK when they shop at Aldi. \u201cThis has been verified time and time again by the industry\u2019s most authoritative independent price survey, the Grocer 33, which in our most recent appearance showed Aldi to be 17.9% cheaper than our nearest competitor.\u201d A spokeswoman for Lidl said it had upped its prices to reflect similar moves by the rest of the market. Bananas are priced in dollars and so the 17% fall in the value of the pound against the US currency since the 23 June Brexit vote means they have become much more expensive to source. Milk and other dairy prices are also being forced up, partly due to a fall in supply after the previously low price forced dairy farmers to reduce their herds or move on to other things. The fall in the value of the pound against the dollar has exacerbated the situation, as competition from imported dairy products has diminished while processors can get more for exporting British cheese, yoghurt and dried milk.",

      "bodyText": "The problem as you correctly identify in your editorial (22 November) is that the employee-director argument goes to the heart of what and whom a company is run for. Getting the right sort of answer to that is vital to knowing how best to reform corporate governance. As you remind us, Lord Bullock in his report in the 1970s concluded that viewing a company as the exclusive property of shareholders is out of touch with the company as a complex social and economic entity. Nearly half a century on and we are still unable to face the implications of this argument. Britain is one of the only remaining large nations in Europe that has failed to recognise the importance of reforming corporate governance. But that needs more than a decision to appoint employee-directors. Little will change within the unitary or single board structures dominant in Anglo-American jurisdictions. The changes can only be realised within a structure of independent supervisory boards, supported by enforceable directors\u2019 duties. We are ensnared by the one-size-fits-all company structure. More complex governance arrangements are probably suitable only to larger companies. If experience elsewhere in Europe is a guide, reforms will enable us to address many of the governance issues that currently face us. Richard Tudway Author, The Looming Corporate Calamity, Burgess Hill, West Sussex \u2022 Your editorial suggests that a \u201cboo\u201d from the CBI was enough for Theresa May to backpedal on her promise to include workers on company boards. But why should she do that? Labour and the Scottish Nationalists would have backed her and surely enough of her own party, so what had she to fear from the CBI? Withdrawal of support? Switching support to Labour? Forty years of the practice in Europe has shown its benefits. Instead of learning from the experience of successful economies and societies, the prime minister falls at the first hurdle in making things better for ordinary people. James Sloan Pulborough, West Sussex \u2022 Your editorial rightly condemns the abandonment of Theresa May\u2019s proposals to require employee representatives on company boards. Her rethink on a hugely expensive nuclear programme didn\u2019t last long, either. And her loudly proclaimed wish for a fairer Britain has seen only modest trimming of Osborne\u2019s harsh plans and some major setbacks (on grammar schools, for example). No one should be surprised if the balance of future proposals greatly favours the better off.

Nearly half a century on and we are still unable to face the implications of this argument.</p> <p>Britain is one of the only remaining large nations in Europe that has failed to recognise the importance of reforming corporate governance. But that needs more than a decision to appoint employee-directors. Little will change within the unitary or single board structures dominant in Anglo-American jurisdictions. The changes can only be realised within a structure of independent supervisory boards, supported by enforceable directors\u2019 duties.</p> <p>We are ensnared by the one-size-fits-all company structure. More complex governance arrangements are probably suitable only to larger companies. If&#xa0;experience elsewhere in Europe is a&#xa0;guide, reforms will enable us to address many of the governance issues that currently face us.<br><strong>Richard Tudway</strong><br><em>Author, </em><a href=\"https://richardtudway.wordpress.com/2015/07/31/the-looming-corporate-calamity/\" title=\"\"><em>The Looming Corporate Calamity</em></a><em>, Burgess Hill, West Sussex</em></p> <p>\u2022 Your editorial suggests that a \u201cboo\u201d from the CBI was enough for Theresa May to backpedal on her promise to include workers on company boards.

      "bodyText": "The care home industry is in an even worse financial state than feared after a revision of government data revealed that nearly 100 more such businesses than previously thought have collapsed since 2010. The release of the figures has heightened calls for Philip Hammond, the chancellor, to offer financial support to care homes in the autumn statement. A total of 380 care home businesses have been declared insolvent since 2010. This is 98 more than previously thought after the Insolvency Service revised its figures to show that the number of insolvencies between 2010 and 2013 was nearly double the previously stated number \u2013 212 up from 114. The Insolvency Service said this was due to an \u201cerror in data processing\u201d that saw the residential care home businesses classified as \u201csocial work activities without accommodation\u201d. Care homes are enduring an unprecedented squeeze on their finances. The amount that councils pay towards fees for residents is falling while costs \u2013 particularly staffing overheads \u2013 increase. Four Seasons, the biggest care home operator in the country with more than 400 properties, recorded a pre-tax loss of \u00a3264m last year, which includes a write down of the value of their care homes. Martin Green, chief executive of trade body Care England, said the government has already received warnings about the state of the industry from the health and social care services regulator. He said: \u201cThe perilous state of the care sector is well known and has been clearly stated by the Care Quality Commission, who described it as at a tipping point. What we need is the government to put an immediate \u00a31bn in new funding in the autumn statement to stabilise the sector and to give breathing space for the development of a long-term funding solution.\u201d The government data shows there has been a surge in insolvencies in the care home sector from 32 businesses in 2010 to 74 in 2015. Another 34 failed in the first six months of 2016. These businesses range from families running one care home to nationwide operators. FRP Advisory, the consultancy firm which uncovered the revision in the government data, said the surge in the number of insolvencies only revealed part of the financial problems in the industry. Chris Stevens, partner at FRP, said: \u201cCorporate insolvencies only tell part of the picture as many care home closures or business failures occur via receiverships \u2013 processes where lenders can often take control of premises owned by sole traders or partnerships in financial difficulty. We know receiverships are also on the rise in the care home sector.\u201d Seperate figures from insolvency agency Opus has found that roughly a third of the remaining 18,000 care homes in Britain are at risk due to their financial health and 13% are \u201czombie operators\u201d that pay more in interest and servicing their debt than they make in profits. Last year George Osborne, then chancellor, gave councils the power to increase council tax by 2% \u2013 a so-called \u201cprecept\u201d \u2013 to help fund care homes and social care. However, industry leaders claim more needs to be done to offset rising costs, which were exacerbated by the introduction of the national living wage in April, which means everyone over the age of 25 must be paid at least \u00a37.20 an hour. Tim Hammond, chief executive of Four Seasons Health Care, said: \u201cA further social care precept of at least 2% or some equivalent measure is essential to mitigate the additional impact of the anticipated increase in the national living wage from April 2017. \u201cFees that local authorities pay for care home places have reduced by 5% in real terms the past three years. The introduction in 2016 of the national living wage, against a backdrop of the existing underfunding, threatened to bring about a collapse in the sector. Where councils raised the precept and passed it on, it helped to some extent to mitigate those additional costs. Furthermore, there has not been any major public resistance. \u201cLooking to the longer term, there is need to ensure that social care funding is sustainable. The precept did not meet the full additional cost of the living wage and it doesn\u2019t begin to address the existing chronic underfunding that remains a threat to the viability of the sector.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Taking their cue from overnight records set on Wall Street, and boosted by further gains as US markets opened higher once more, European investors pushed shares higher once more. Despite dips in the oil price on renewed doubts about Opec agreeing output cuts next week, the prospect of a Trump boost to spending continued to support markets. In Europe, French and German markets were lifted once again by recent political developments - Francois Fillon\u2019s victory in the French presidential primary and Angela Merkel standing for a fourth term as German chancellor. As for the UK, the pound weakened ahead of Wednesday\u2019s Autumn Statement, but shares simply shrugged this off. Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at IG,said: Ahead of tomorrow\u2019s Autumn Statement sterling remains weak, dropping back from yesterday\u2019s highs above $1.25. It is clear that the chancellor faces a difficult set of choices, with little wiggle room. Given the still murky path ahead for the UK economy, it is hard to see how Mr Hammond can do more than tinker around the edges. Markets will be watching closely for signs of concern about the economic outlook, which could see the pound weaken further against the dollar and the euro. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished up 41.76 points or 0.62% at 6819.72 Germany\u2019s Dax rose 0.27% to 10,713.85 France\u2019s Cac closed up 0.41% at 4548.35 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB was 1.37% better at 16,519.89 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended up 0.43% at 8651.5 In Greece, the Athens market added 2.5% to 631.21 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 0.12% at 18980, having earlier surged past 19,000 to 19014. On that note, it\u2019s time to close for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. Here\u2019s an interesting chart showing the moves in various commodities following Donald Trump\u2019s US election victory: Despite the better than expected eurozone consumer confidence figures, there is a chance the mood may not last, says economist Bert Colijn at ING Bank: Eurozone consumers have good reason to cheer in November. The oil price fell sharply at the start of the month and Eurozone stock prices have gained on the Trump victory. The unemployment rate has been flat over the summer months, but the employment outlook has been improving recently as companies are indicating to be hiring at a faster pace in both services and industry. This seems to have humoured the Eurozone consumer, who had been cautious through the summer months awaiting a negative Brexit response that has turned out to be mild so far. The question is whether this momentum can continue to build in the coming months though. While some of the tailwind for the consumer is likely to be maintained, there are also factors that could bring the consumer down to earth. As inflation is likely to continue to increase in the coming months, real wages will probably take a hit before nominal wage growth edges up again. And after a mild response to Brexit and the Trump election, will the Eurozone consumer respond more negatively to political uncertainty within the Eurozone? As a \u2018no\u2019 in the Italian referendum is ahead in the polls for the moment, it could well be that we will soon find out. The improved eurozone consumer confidence figures bode well for future growth in the region, says Howard Archer, chief European and UK economist at IHG Markit: An encouraging boost to Eurozone growth prospects as consumer confidence rose for a third month running in November - and markedly - to reach an 11-month high. Furthermore, consumer confidence is now at a very decent level compared to long-term norms. Consumers across the Eurozone hare currently benefiting from pretty decent fundamentals overall, notably including higher employment and still very low inflation. This buoys hopes that the Eurozone is on course for improved GDP growth in the fourth quarter after expansion was limited to 0.3% quarter-on-quarter in both the third and second quarters. We currently expect fourth-quarter GDP growth of 0.4% quarter-on-quarter and believe that 0.5% expansion is a genuine possibility. However, we have significant concerns over the Eurozone growth outlook for 2017 amid an uncertain political outlook. While there are no details available, it seems reasonable suspect that the marked rise in Eurozone consumer confidence in November was due to improved perceptions on the economic situation and outlook. It is also likely that job concerns eased across the Eurozone after recently worsening. This was certainly true of both the Netherlands and Belgium, which have released their November surveys. Significantly, latest data showed that Eurozone unemployment dropped at an increased rate in September after labour markets had shown signs of faltering. Any improvement in Eurozone consumer confidence \u2013 particularly a marked increase \u2013 is to be welcomed as the consumer clearly is vital to Eurozone growth prospects. Back with the eurozone, and consumer confidence rose by more than expected in November, despite the continuing uncertainties of Brexit. The initial estimate for the eurozone rose by 1.9 points to -6.1 points, better than the forecast -7.8 points. In the European Union as a while, confidence edged up by 0.7 points to -5.8. Dennis de Jong, managing director at UFX.com, said: EU consumer confidence hasn\u2019t been in positive territory for nearly two decades so today\u2019s negative reading is no surprise, but [ECB president] Mario Draghi will be pleased to see the above expectations data is at least moving in the right direction. Draghi deserves credit for maintaining a relatively stable eurozone economy at one of the most uncertain geopolitical times in memory. With the cloud of Brexit hanging over the future direction of the eurozone, in addition to volatile elections and referendums on the horizon that could add further uncertainty, holding firm is likely just what the doctor ordered. Some upbeat US economic news, with new home sales rising to their highest level in more than nine and a half years in October. The National Association of Realtors said sales rose 2% to an annual rate of 5.6m, with September\u2019s figure revised up from 5.47m to 5.49m. Analysts had expected a figure of 5.43m in October. Meanwhile the Richmond Federal Reserve composite manufacturing index came in at +4 in November, compared to -4 in October. The surge in US markets - based on the recent strength of the oil price and hopes that Donald Trumps infrastructure plans will boost the economy - is continuing. The Dow Jones Industrial Average has breached 19,000 for the first time, touching 19007, before slipping back to 18,991, up 0.18%. Both the Nasdaq Composite - up 0.37% - and the S&amp;P 500 - 0.23% better - opened at new peaks. Over in the eurozone, and some good news from Portugal: The oil price has been rising in recent days on growing expectation that Opec might agree to limit output at its meeting next week, following an outline plan drawn up in Algiers in September. But as is always the case, it does not take much to dent the mood. Reuters is reporting that Iran, Iraq and Indonesia have doubts about the proposed output cut. So Brent crude, previously as high as $49.96m a barrel today is now down 0.59% at $48.61. And West Texas Intermediate is now down 0.56% at $47.97. 1) Britain is on track to blow past its budget forecasts for this year, despite cutting its borrowing in October by 25%. The UK has now borrowed \u00a348.6bn since April 2016, down from \u00a354.2bn a year ago, but already close to the \u00a355bn target for this current financial year (to March 2017). Economists believe it could overshoot the target by \u00a310bn or more, underlining the weak state of the public finances. The better news is that October\u2019s deficit fell to \u00a34.8bn, from \u00a36.4bn a year ago, thanks to a rise in corporation tax receipts. 2) UK families are more pessimistic about the long-term impact of leaving the EU. A new survey showed that confidence fell across all ages and income groups in the last three months. 3) British factories have reported a pick-up in orders, after a summer slowdown. However, many are also planning to hike prices to cover the slump in the pound. 4) The pound\u2019s decline since June has wiped out $1.5trn of UK wealth, according to Credit Suisse\u2019s regular report: Back in the City, the FTSE 100 is on track to close at its highest level since 10 November - the day after the US election. There\u2019s a general rally in the markets today, as investors react to last night\u2019s record close on Wall Street. Mining companies are still leading the charge, after Goldman Sachs announced that it is now bullish about commodity prices. That helped send the copper price up to a one-week high. Chris Beauchamp of IG says traders are jumping on board the rally before New York\u2019s stock market closes on Thursday for Thanksgiving: The week before Thanksgiving is never a good time to be short, since those of a bearish disposition tend to suffer a fate akin to a roasted turkey. Goldman Sachs\u2019 decision to turn into commodity bulls has bolstered the London mining community, aside from precious metals miners, with the investment bank remaining downbeat on the outlook for gold. And the party could continue today, with the US markets expected to rise at the open (in about one hour\u2019s time). British households have become more gloomy about the long-term economic consequences of leaving the European Union. Data firm Markit reports that 49.3% of people surveyed think Britain\u2019s economic outlook over the next decade has worsened due to the Brexit vote, while 31% of survey respondents think prospects have improved. That means Markit\u2019s index of long-term pessimism index has dropped to -18.4%, compared to -11.1% in August and just -3.5% in July. However, people are a little more optimistic about short-term economic prospects; 12.4% of people expect the economy to fare better over the next six months, up from 11.8% in August. Markit also found that younger people are more pessimistic about the Brexit vote, while older people - who had initially been upbeat about the situation - are now less optimistic. And those with the lowest incomes have also become more anxious, having originally been the most optimistic about the impact of Brexit: Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit, says people are concluding that Brexit will have a higher economic cost than they first thought: \u201cOn average, people have become considerably more pessimistic about the impact of the decision to leave the EU on the economy over the next decade. \u201cOnly those working in manufacturing have become more upbeat about the economy\u2019s prospects, presumably seeing some benefit of the weaker pound in relation to boosting export performance. However, even here the number of people seeing Brexit to have boosted the economy\u2019s prospects over the next ten years only narrowly exceeds those expecting to see a negative impact. More details here. We have another gobbet of goodish news ahead of tomorrow\u2019s autumn statement. British factory order books have improved to their best level since June\u2019s EU referendum, according to the CBI\u2019s monthly survey. 23% of manufacturers reported that their total order books are above normal, while 26% said they were below normal, giving a balance of -3%. This was above average, and back to the levels seen through the summer. It suggests the sector is stable, despite the uncertainty around Brexit. But the survey also shows that firms expect to hike prices in the next few months, following the slump in the pound\u2019s value since the Brexit vote. Food and drink manufacturers are particularly affected. Rain Newton-Smith, CBI Chief Economist, says: \u201cIt\u2019s good to see manufacturers\u2019 overall order books at healthy levels, and the outlook for output growth remaining robust as we head into Christmas. \u201cBut the weak pound is beginning to make its mark, and prices are expected to rise, especially in the food and drink sector. On the flip side though, export orders remain above average. Bloomberg say today\u2019s public finances are a \u201cboost\u201d to Philip Hammond ahead of tomorrow\u2019s autumn statement. But... it won\u2019t spare the chancellor from announcing weaker growth and higher borrowing forecasts: Here\u2019s our news story about today\u2019s public finances: This chart highlights how Britain has made little progress in cutting the deficit this financial year: Today\u2019s figures show that the pace of deficit reduction is \u201cfrustratingly slow\u201d, says Martin Beck, senior economic advisor to the EY ITEM Club. He agrees that the UK government has fallen behind its deficit reduction plan, despite cutting borrowing by \u00a31.6bn in October to \u00a34.8bn. Beck says: \u201cThe stronger October outturn and some favourable revisions to prior months meant that borrowing was \u00a35.6bn lower than a year earlier over the first seven months of fiscal year 2016-17. But this still leaves the Government behind schedule in terms of achieving the OBR\u2019s full year forecast. If this trend continues over the remaining five months of the year then borrowing would overshoot by around \u00a311bn. In reality the situation is probably a little less bleak, as forestalling associated with the pre-announced increase in dividend tax should cause a sharp rise in self-assessment income tax receipts in the first couple of months of 2017. But even allowing for this, Public Sector Net Borrowing (PSNB) looks set to come in some way above the OBR\u2019s full-year forecast of \u00a355.5bn. Resolution Group\u2019s Duncan Weldon has crunched the tax receipt data, and found that growth has tailed off a little: (Apologies, I initially posted the wrong tax receipt numbers in the 10.04am entry, so you might need to refresh) Britain\u2019s total national debt has risen by \u00a350bn over the last 12 months, and now stands at a decidedly lofty \u00a31,641.6 billion pounds. But..... debt as a percentage of GDP has actually been falling for the last five months, as Britain\u2019s economy has been growing slightly faster than the debt pile. The means the national debt is 83.8% of national output, down from 84.3% in October 2015. Britain\u2019s public finances benefitted from a pick up in tax revenues last month, says the ONS. Central government receipts in October 2016 were \u00a359.1bn, up \u00a33.8bn (or 6.8%), compared with October 2015, says the ONS. October is traditionally a strong month for tax receipts, and last month saw a 9% spike in corporation tax receipts, which hit the highest level for any October since 2010, Bloomberg says. But income tax receipts dipped a little. Here\u2019s the details of October\u2019s tax receipts: Corporation Tax increased by \u00a31.7bn, or 23.6%, to \u00a39.0bn Interest &amp; dividends receipts increased by \u00a31.0bn, or 33.9%, to \u00a33.9bn Social (National Insurance) contributions increased by \u00a30.6bn, or 6.4%, to \u00a39.6bn VAT receipts increased by \u00a3300m, or 2.8%, to \u00a311.5bn Income Tax-related payments decreased by \u00a3300m, or 2.4%, to \u00a311.4bn Economist Sam Tombs of Pantheon tweets that Britain is on track to borrow around \u00a368bn this financial year -- much more than the \u00a355bn which was predicted in March\u2019s budget. Surely Philip Hammond will admit tomorrow that this year\u2019s deficit target will be missed? Here\u2019s some instant reaction to October\u2019s public finances: Here we go! Britain borrowed less than feared last month, but is still on track to breach this year\u2019s deficit target. Britain borrowed \u00a34.796bn in October, the ONS says. That\u2019s down from \u00a36.4bn in October 2015. That is rather better than the \u00a36bn which the City expected [this excludes the impact of the taxpayers\u2019 stakes in the banking sector]. It means that Britain has now borrowed \u00a348.6bn since April 2016 - down from \u00a354.2bn in April-October 2015. So the deficit has dropped by \u00a35.6bn so far this year, which means Britain is probably missing the government\u2019s target of a \u00a355bn deficit for this financial year. This chart shows how much Britain has borrowed this year (the final orange line), and the final target for borrowing this financial year (the blue blob). More to follow! The weakness of the French economy continues to hurt Kingfisher. The DIY chain has reported a 3.6% slide in like-for-like sales during the last quarter in France, where it runs the Castorama and Brico D\u00e9p\u00f4t chains. That took the shine off a 5.8% jump in comparable sales in the UK, led by its Screwfix arm. Kingfisher CEO V\u00e9ronique Laury is trying to turn things around with a new efficiency plan. But the City isn\u2019t impressed, sending Kingfisher\u2019s shares down 2%. George Salmon, Equity Analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, fears that Laury will struggle: Previous Kingfisher bosses have tried and failed with similar plans, and just now trading conditions look challenging. UK builders merchants have reported tougher conditions, and the French economic outlook is uncertain.\u201d Britain\u2019s vote to leave the EU destroyed $1.5trillion of wealth and cut the number of dollar millionaires in the UK by 15%. That\u2019s according to Credit Suisse\u2019s latest wealth report, which highlights the impact of the 16% tumble in the value of the pound since June Michael O\u2019Sullivan, chief investment officer in Credit Suisse\u2019s wealth management arm, explains: \u201cThe impact of the Brexit vote is widely thought of in terms of GDP but the impact on household wealth bears watching. \u201cSince the Brexit vote, UK household wealth has fallen by $1.5tn. Wealth per adult has already dropped by $33,000 to $289,000 since the end of June. In fact, in US dollar terms, 406,000 people in the UK are no longer millionaires.\u201d The report also found that the richest % of people across the globe still own more wealth than the rest of the world put together - prompting development charity Oxfam to push the government to help the poorest in society. Here\u2019s the full story: Kit Juckes of French bank Societe Generale also expects that today\u2019s public finances will show there\u2019s been little progress in eliminating the deficit this year. We look for a deficit excluding public sector banks of \u00a36bn, a small fall from a year ago and a cumulative fall of just \u00a32.3bn for the first seven months of the fiscal year compared to 2015/2016. This pace of improvement in the trend in public finances is disappointing relative to the resilience of the economy this year and limits the scope for any fiscal largesse going forwards. European stock markets have jumped at the start of trading, after the US market hit fresh record highs last night. In London the FTSE 100 index has risen by 50 points to 6828, up 0.75%. Mining stocks are leading, with Anglo American gaining 4.9% and BHP Billiton up 3.8%. Germany\u2019s DAX and France\u2019s CAC indices are both up around 0.6%, as investors catch up with a strong rally on Wall Street on Monday that drove all four indices to record levels. The prospect of a new splurge of US government spending is pushing shares higher, says FXTM Chief Market Strategist Hussein Sayed. There are clearly no signs of profit taking yet, with Donald Trump\u2019s reflationary economic plans of cutting taxes, infrastructure spending and less regulations remain to be the number one reason fueling stocks\u2019 gains. So much for those analysts who predicted a market crash if Trump became president. Even the news that Trump is now moonlighting as Nigel Farage\u2019s career advisor hasn\u2019t ended the rally..... Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. With Britain\u2019s autumn statement due tomorrow, investors will be particularly interested in today\u2019s main event -- the UK public finances for October. Economists predict that Britain had to borrow around \u00a36bn to balance the books last month, down from \u00a36.4bn in October 2015. Any reduction in the nation\u2019s deficit is welcome, but this fall wouldn\u2019t bring the public finances back into line, given disappointing figures earlier in the financial year. Since April, Britain has already borrowed \u00a345.5bn -- just \u00a32.3bn less than a year earlier. That means there\u2019s very little chance of hitting the old target of \u00a355bn for the 2016-17 financial year, as this chart shows: September\u2019s public finances were a particular shocker, as Howard Archer of IHS Global Insight reminds us: The public finances worsened appreciably in September compared to a year earlier. Specifically, Public Sector Net Borrowing excluding banks (PSNBex) amounted to \u00a310.6 billion in September, which was up from a shortfall of \u00a39.3 billion in September 2015. While the economy has shown overall resilience following June\u2019s Brexit vote, tax receipts have taken some hit. Indeed, corporation tax fell year-on-year in September. Chancellor Philip Hammond is already expected to tell MPs tomorrow that UK growth forecasts have been revised down, meaning Britain will borrow tens of billions of pounds more than expected over the next few years. Fiona Cincotta of City Index believes this bad news could easily drive up Britain\u2019s borrowing costs in the financial markets. In order to shore up the economy the government is expected to increase its borrowing, with upward revisions to net borrowing figures ranging from \u00a38 billion to an extra \u00a318 billion for 2017-18, taking the total to somewhere in the region of \u00a363.5 billion - \u00a373.5 billion. Should this amount be added to gilt issuance it would represent a significant increase which we would then expect to increase the UK\u2019s rate at which it borrows. Therefore, any significantly large increase in future borrowing tomorrow from Hammond in his Autumn Statement, is likely to send the yields higher. [yields rise when prices fall, and show the effective interest rate on a bond] Also coming up.... The economics calendar is a little sparse, but we do get a new measure of eurozone consumer confidence and US home sales (both at 3pm GMT) Economists will be digesting the news that Donald Trump will pull America out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership on his first day as president. That won\u2019t calm fears that we\u2019re heading into choppy waters of trade wars and protectionism. And in the City, food group Compass, retail chain Kingfisher, online electrical retailer AO World, pub chain Mitchells &amp; Butler and bank note maker De La Rue are all reporting results.",

While some of the tailwind for the consumer is likely to be maintained, there are also factors that could bring the consumer down to earth.

It is also likely that job concerns eased across the Eurozone after recently worsening. This was certainly true of both the Netherlands and Belgium, which have released their November surveys. Significantly, latest data showed that Eurozone unemployment dropped at an increased rate in September after labour markets had shown signs of faltering.</p> <p>Any improvement in Eurozone consumer confidence \u2013 particularly a marked increase \u2013 is to be welcomed as the consumer clearly is vital to Eurozone growth prospects. </p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-58345ea1e4b0e0ad2d75beff\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-11-22T15:09:56.426Z\">3.09pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Eurozone consumer confidence beats forecasts</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Back with the eurozone, and consumer confidence rose by more than expected in November, despite the continuing uncertainties of Brexit.</p> <p>The initial estimate for the eurozone rose by 1.9 points to -6.1 points, better than the forecast -7.8 points.</p> <p>In the European Union as a while, confidence edged up by 0.7 points to -5.8.

Accountants EY immediately made 251 of the 750-strong workforce redundant. Many of those who lost their jobs were crane operators. Some 133 were transferred to Ashtead Plant Hire (A-Plant) which bought parts of the operation for \u00a329m. The remainder are currently being kept on, in part to help service Hewden\u2019s 40 plant hire depots across the UK. \u201cThis is a sickening blow for workers in the run up to Christmas and is the result of a succession of venture capitalists hawking Hewden around the market over a number of years to make a quick buck,\u201d said Unite national officer Bernard McAulay, who mainly represents crane operators at Hewden. The Manchester-based heavy machinery rental firm was owned by private equity firm Sun Capital Partners and in October had warned about \u201cmarket uncertainty following the vote to leave the EU\u201d which had adversely affected a number of large construction and investment projects. \u201cWe are currently in contact with the administrators over the transfer of workers to A-Plant, in addition to other crane operators and plant hire companies to try and find work for under threat Hewden workers,\u201d said McAulay. Some 15,000 pieces of equipment are estimated out be out on hire from the company, which supplied services to companies such as British Steel in Scunthorpe and the Grangemouth and Fawley refineries. Sam Woodward, joint administrator at EY, said: \u201cWe are assessing the optimum strategy for maximising value in the remainder of the group. In the meantime, we will continue to work with stakeholders to maintain service levels to customers who have assets on hire.\u201d He said the management had been trying to find buyers or find fresh funding \u2013 it had \u00a3190m of debt \u2013 but failed to do so. \u201cManagement has been attempting to operationally reshape the business to focus on higher margin and quicker returning assets and services. However, this has proven challenging with the group\u2019s capital structure and the recent trading environment,\u201d said Woodward. Hewden\u2019s last set of accounts for the company were filed a year ago and cover the financial year to the end of December 2014, for which it reported a \u00a316.6m loss. The company appears to operate two pension schemes \u2013 into which it said it intended to contribute \u00a32.9m during the coming financial year. \u201cUnite will also be working closely with the administrators to ensure workers aren\u2019t short-changed out of their pensions and that a future for the company\u2019s workers can be secured,\u201d said McAulay. The Pension Protection Fund \u2013 which looks after members of final salary pension schemes of companies that fail \u2013 said: \u201cWe are aware of the situation and members of the company\u2019s defined benefit schemes can be reassured that the PPF is there to protect them if their company fails.\u201d",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Morrisons is reviving the Safeway brand after 11 years as part of its attempt to move back into the fast-growing convenience market. The former supermarket brand, which disappeared in November 2005 after being bought by Morrisons, will front a range of hundreds of food and grocery products, many of which will be produced within the Bradford-based company\u2019s own factories. Morrisons will begin distributing the range in the first half of next year, although the retailer has not confirmed whether it will be handling relations with independent stores directly or working with a distribution firm. The move could result in the Safeway brand competing for space on convenience store shelves with established wholesale brands such as Booker\u2019s Happy Shopper and Nisa Today\u2019s Heritage. Clive Black, a retail analyst at Morrisons\u2019 house broker, Shore Capital, said the move would improve the utilisation of the supermarket\u2019s manufacturing facilities. The group has 16 factories, including its own abattoirs, making it the UK\u2019s second-biggest food manufacturer. Black said: \u201cThe return of the Safeway brand [is] an eminently sensible move to our minds, reflecting the warm heritage and feel that this much-liked label had in days gone by.\u201d The move is part of a broader strategy to tap into the convenience store market, which Morrisons previously tried and failed to enter via its now defunct M Local chain. Morrisons is also planning to test out 10 more petrol forecourt stores via a new deal with petrol station operator Rontec and wholesaler Palmer and Harvey. Four stores, called Morrisons Daily and selling Morrisons-branded products, will open before Christmas and a further six in January. Morrisons already operates five petrol station convenience stores as part of a trial with another forecourt operator, Motor Fuel Group. David Potts, the chief executive of Morrisons, said: \u201cThese are two capital-light ways of growing in the convenience food market. By working with well-established partners and reviving the Safeway brand, we are making our products more accessible to more customers.\u201d The move comes as more shoppers switch to picking up a few groceries on a daily basis rather than in a big weekly shop. Small local stores are expected to see an 11.7% rise in sales over the next five years compared with 0.8% growth at supermarkets, according to the grocery trade body IGD. Morrisons is also building its relationship with US online retailer Amazon. The British supermarket supplies groceries to the Amazon Fresh food business and last week expanded the relationship to its Prime Now quick delivery service in London and Hertfordshire.",

    "webTitle": "Brexit deadlock could halt flights to Europe, warns Ryanair boss", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Political deadlock over Brexit could halt flights between the UK and Europe, according to the chief executive of Ryanair, who warned that Britain\u2019s aviation industry is being \u201cwalked off a cliff\u201d by the government. Michael O\u2019Leary said that \u201cmildly lunatic optimism\u201d on the part of the government was masking the risks the UK faced from leaving the EU, with an assumption that it could quickly negotiate new bilateral agreements. O\u2019Leary said it was a \u201cplausible risk\u201d that no bilateral deal for the airline industry would be forthcoming in time. \u201cEveryone is underestimating in the UK the political situation in Europe. You can see a set of circumstances on the day of Brexit when nobody is flying between the UK and Europe. Even interim arrangements have to be approved by the European parliament.\u201d At the Airport Operators Association conference in London, O\u2019Leary lambasted ministers for acting \u201clike Dad\u2019s Army\u201d. He said: \u201cThese guys have no idea where they\u2019re going for the next two years and the problem is that in the absence of any discussions with the Europeans on Brexit they\u2019re all talking to themselves. \u201cThey haven\u2019t got a clue. There is no prospect of an interim deal. \u201cIf you listen to the Germans, the Dutch or the French you\u2019re going to get screwed into the floor.\u201d Speaking on Monday at the conference, transport secretary Chris Grayling gave an assurance that aviation would be \u201cprioritised\u201d in Brexit negotiations. But O\u2019Leary said that a meeting last week between industry leaders, including Ryanair, the Brexit minister David Davis and aviation minister Lord Ahmad, had confirmed his fears for the sector. He countered: \u201cThat\u2019s what they say to all the boys ... They clearly have no priorities.\u201d O\u2019Leary warned: \u201cThe European airports have seen this an opportunity to win more business away from the UK. Unless there\u2019s some significant change the UK is going to walk itself off a cliff.\u201d He said that for planning airline schedules, \u201cI need to know by March next year what\u2019s going to happen in Britain in summer 2019. There isn\u2019t a politician who knows that.\u201d O\u2019Leary\u2019s warnings were echoed in more sober terms by a Brussels-based international airports association. Olivier Jankovec, the chief executive of ACI Europe, warned that there was a lot of \u201cwishful thinking\u201d from ministers and the aviation industry. He said: \u201cA lot of people might assume in the end it will be fine. At present it is still somehow wishful thinking. The UK will have to negotiate the terms and conditions and won\u2019t be covered by EU agreements. It is doubtful that some airlines will be able to fly freely.\u201d Jankovec said that hopes of a special deal for aviation to remain in the EU single market for aviation could be thwarted. \u201cI wish we could single out aviation and separate it but from what I\u2019m hearing in Brussels things don\u2019t look like they are going this way.\u201d Willie Walsh, the chief executive of British Airways\u2019 parent company, IAG, said he was less concerned about the effects of Brexit but warned: \u201cOur negotiating position is not as strong as people might think. I do think that Europe will see this as an opportunity to damage the UK.\u201d He said that in a bilateral deal over flying rights struck last month with China, \u201cwe didn\u2019t get very much of what the UK wanted. That worries me.\u201d However, he said there was no prospect of BA\u2019s owning group being broken up after Brexit, as O\u2019Leary had suggested. Walsh said that IAG had \u201ctested and robust\u201d structures in place to deal with restrictions on international ownership of airlines.",

He said: \u201cThese guys have no idea where they\u2019re going for the next two years and the problem is that in the absence of any discussions with the Europeans on Brexit they\u2019re all talking to themselves.</p> <p>\u201cThey haven\u2019t got a clue. There is no prospect of an interim deal.</p> <p>\u201cIf you listen to the Germans, the Dutch or the French you\u2019re going to get screwed into the floor.\u201d</p> <p>Speaking on Monday at the conference, transport secretary Chris Grayling gave an assurance that aviation would be \u201cprioritised\u201d in Brexit negotiations.</p> <p>But O\u2019Leary said that a meeting last week between industry leaders, including Ryanair, the Brexit minister David Davis and aviation minister Lord Ahmad, had confirmed his fears for the sector. </p> <p>He countered: \u201cThat\u2019s what they say to all the boys ... They clearly have no priorities.\u201d</p> <p>O\u2019Leary warned: \u201cThe European airports have seen this an opportunity to win more business away from the UK. Unless there\u2019s some significant change the UK is going to walk itself off a cliff.\u201d<br></p> <p>He said that for planning airline schedules, \u201cI need to know by March next year what\u2019s going to happen in Britain in summer 2019. There isn\u2019t a politician who knows that.\u201d</p> <p>O\u2019Leary\u2019s warnings were echoed in more sober terms by a Brussels-based international airports association. Olivier Jankovec, the chief executive of ACI Europe, warned that there was a lot of \u201cwishful thinking\u201d from ministers and the aviation industry.</p> <p>He said: \u201cA lot of people might assume in the end it will be fine. At present it is still somehow wishful thinking. The UK will have to negotiate the terms and conditions and won\u2019t be covered by EU agreements. It is doubtful that some airlines will be able to fly freely.\u201d</p> <p>Jankovec said that hopes of a special deal for aviation to remain in the EU single market for aviation could be thwarted. \u201cI wish we could single out aviation and separate it but from what I\u2019m hearing in Brussels things don\u2019t look like they are going this way.\u201d</p> <p>Willie Walsh, the chief executive of British Airways\u2019 parent company, IAG, said he was less concerned about the effects of Brexit but warned: \u201cOur negotiating position is not as strong as people might think. I do think that Europe will see this as an opportunity to damage the UK.\u201d</p> <p>He said that in a bilateral deal over flying rights struck last month with China, \u201cwe didn\u2019t get very much of what the UK wanted. That worries me.\u201d</p> <p>However, he said there was no prospect of BA\u2019s owning group being broken up after Brexit, as O\u2019Leary had suggested. Walsh said that IAG had \u201ctested and robust\u201d structures in place to deal with restrictions on international ownership of airlines. </p>",

Michael O\u2019Leary said his ambition was to offer zero fares \u2013 with the airline making its money from sharing revenues with airports where it had attracted passengers. Speaking at the Airport Operators Association conference in London, he said the increasingly attractive deals being offered to his airline by European airports, as well as the possible reduction or abolition of taxes such as air passenger duty (APD), would eventually allow his airline to give away flights. He said: \u201cThe challenge for us in the future is to keep driving air fares down. I have this vision that in the next five to 10 years that the air fares on Ryanair will be free, in which case the flights will be full, and we will be making our money out of sharing the airport revenues; of all the people who will be running through airports, and getting a share of the shopping and the retail revenues at airports.\u201d The Irish airline expects to carry 119m passengers this year and is growing its aircraft fleet rapidly, with capacity to pass 200m by 2024. Most of that growth, O\u2019Leary said, would come from \u201ctaking price sensitive passengers off incumbents like Air Berlin in Germany, Lot in Poland and Alitalia in Italy\u201d.

    "webTitle": "The Brexit economy: remarkable resilience as spectre of inflation looms", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The chancellor, Philip Hammond, has been given a boost ahead of his maiden autumn statement by a Guardian analysis showing the economy continues to confound gloomy forecasts for a post-referendum slump. A bumper month for retail sales, a steady housing market, broad-based business growth and a drop in the jobless rate have all boosted hopes for a strong finish to the year for the UK economy. Hammond is being warned, however, to look past the signs of early resilience to a challenging 2017 when Brexit talks begin in earnest, rising inflation starts to bite and the world gets to grips with Donald Trump taking over the US presidency. For now, however, the pound has steadied on financial markets and the economic signals point to resilient consumers. That will provide some solace to Hammond as he prepares to deliver his speech on Wednesday, when he will be forced to concede that the longer-term outlook for the economy is gloomier than at his predecessor George Osborne\u2019s budget just eight months ago. To track the impact of the Brexit vote on a monthly basis, the Guardian has chosen eight economic indicators, as well as the value of the pound and the performance of the FTSE. The dashboard for November shows a better than expected performance in five of the eight categories. Two were worse than expected and inflation was lower than economists forecast, defying expectations for it to rise swiftly on the back of the weak pound. Five months on from the vote to leave the EU, the latest batch of figures show unemployment dropped to an 11-year low, retail sales rose sharply, house prices picked up, business activity continued to grow and the public finances improved. But Britain\u2019s trade gap with the rest of the world widened and wage growth stalled. The pound has recovered some ground in the latest month, as investor focus shifts away from the UK currency and instead to the euro after Trump\u2019s victory raised fears of similar anti-establishment gains in a host of elections in the eurozone over coming months. Analysts also said the pound may have found a floor, having dropped 10% against the euro and 16% against the dollar since the referendum. On stock markets, the FTSE 100 leading index is off a record high hit in October but is still 8% above it\u2019s pre-referendum level. The more domestically focused FTSE 250 is 2% higher than it was on the day of the referendum. But behind the upbeat headlines there are growing signs the weak pound will push up prices and squeeze household budgets in the months ahead. Wage growth is expected to slow and economists warn that with employment growth already waning, pay will struggle to keep up with living costs next year. Andrew Sentance, a former Bank of England policymaker, said price pressures were clearly rising. \u201cIt is clear from the measure of input prices paid by manufacturers that a wave of inflation is coming through the pipeline driven by a weaker pound. We should therefore still expect to see inflation at around 3% or just below by the end of next year. \u201cThat will squeeze real consumer spending growth, adding to the slowdown generated by uncertainty affecting investment plans.\u201d Household worries about inflation are already rising after high-profile pricing tussles between supermarkets and big brands such as Typhoo and Walkers crisps. Eight out of 10 consumers said they were worried that changes in inflation over the next 12 months would affect the cost of everyday goods, according to one YouGov poll for Barclaycard. As a result, people\u2019s overall confidence in the UK economy and in their own finances waned. For businesses, the pound\u2019s weakness also weighed heavy. Despite the boost to competitiveness for those selling their goods overseas, exports fell in the latest trade figures while imports rose. At the same time, the weak pound ramped up the cost of importing raw materials and manufacturers started to pass some of that on to their clients. Putting some solid figures behind the rows over Marmite and other foods, the latest official data on manufacturers\u2019 costs showed they soared 12.2% in the year to October, the biggest increase for five years. So-called \u201cfactory gate\u201d prices charged to their customers were up 2.1% on the year, the biggest rise for more than four years. That was echoed in the services sector \u2013 encompassing shops, hotels, bars and banks \u2013 where businesses faced the biggest one-month jump in costs for 20 years in October, according to the closely watched Markit/CIPS services PMI report. Business investment is expected to suffer as company bosses fret about those rising costs, as well as political uncertainty. Economists warn that the nervous climate will translate into firms putting off big spending and hiring decisions. The Bank of England predicts a slowdown in business investment will weigh on overall economic growth next year. Writing in the Guardian, a former member of the Bank\u2019s monetary policy committee (MPC), David Blanchflower, said Hammond should heed those longer-term forecasts. \u201cThe UK economy is slowing, there is no doubt about it. The incoming data so far though are mixed as it is early days post the Brexit vote,\u201d said Blanchflower, professor of economics at Dartmouth College in the US. \u201cGDP growth isn\u2019t set to slow sharply in the fourth quarter of 2016 but 2017 is likely a different matter.\u201d He urged the chancellor to respond with big initiatives to shore up growth, or risk further antagonising voters. \u201cIt is time to condemn austerity into the dustbin of history. It is the unnecessary hang-up with debts and deficits that has got us into this fine populist mess in the first place.\u201d There was little hint of such a change of direction in a Treasury reaction to public finance data on Tuesday showing the deficit was smaller than expected in October. A Treasury spokesman said: \u201cAs the chancellor has made clear, the government is committed to fiscal discipline and will return the budget to balance over a sensible period of time, in a way that allows space to support the economy as needed.\u201d Headline growth figures have defied gloomy forecasts made during a bitter referendum campaign and in the wake of the Brexit vote, when many economists predicted a recession. An update on GDP from the Office for National Statistics later this week is expected to confirm its previous estimate that the economy grew a relatively strong 0.5% in the three months following the Brexit vote, down only slightly from 0.7% growth in the run-up to the referendum. But analysts believe details released with this latest GDP report will show business investment slowed following the Brexit vote. Chris Hare, economist at Investec commented: \u201cWhen economic uncertainty rises, business investment tends to be the first casualty \u2013 in such episodes businesses, tend to revert to \u2018wait-and-see\u2019 mode and postpone their capital spending plans.\u201d",

The incoming data so far though are mixed as it is early days post the Brexit vote. The PMIs were quite strong, suggesting GDP growth isn\u2019t set to slow sharply in the fourth quarter of 2016 but 2017 is likely a different matter. Retail sales were also pretty good. Despite the boost from the fall in sterling, Britain\u2019s trade deficit with the rest of the world widened unexpectedly in September. Inflation surprised to the downside but major price rises look to be in the pipeline as factory gate prices increased 0.6% in October compared with an increase of 0.3% in September. The UK claimant count rose by 10,000 in October, while average weekly earnings grew by \u00a31 between April and September. XPertHR, the pay consultants, report that the median private-sector pay award stood at 2% in the year to 31 August 2016, unchanged from that recorded 12 months previously. Private sector employers are predicting a median 2% pay award in the year to 31 August 2017. The MPC thinks 3.75% is on the horizon shortly. There is every probability that the Office for Budget Responsibility will suggest this week that the public finances are in a terrible mess due to the weakening outlook for the economy. There is some suggestion that there is little room for a fiscal boost to the economy. It is time to condemn austerity into the dustbin of history. It is the unnecessary hang-up with debts and deficits that has got us into this fine populist mess in the first place. In a major macro error in 2010, George Osborne slashed \u00a330bn from public investment. Now Philip Hammond looks set to respond to the slowing economy with a trifling \u00a31.3bn on infrastructure and roads. To put this in context, the UK has 29,145 miles of main roads 2,173 miles of motorways and 213,750 miles of paved roads so that should cover the cost of filling in about one pothole a mile. Or put another way, it is equivalent to about a fifth of the cost of refurbishing the Houses of Parliament and Buckingham Palace. Too little too late as ever. Oh dear. Andrew Sentance, senior economic adviser at the consultancy PwC and former member of the Bank\u2019s MPC from October 2006 to May 2011 The picture of the UK economy since the Brexit vote is that consumer spending and services activity are supporting growth and employment. We still don\u2019t have any hard data on the investment side of the economy \u2013 but even when we do it may be several quarters before the impact of post-Brexit uncertainty shows up in the level of capital spending. GDP held up in the third quarter better than expected and the early data for the current quarter \u2013 on retail sales and the purchasing managers\u2019 survey of services activity \u2013 has been positive. The unemployment rate has continued to fall, though the rate of growth of new job creation appears to be slowing. One surprise this month was a drop in the inflation rate, from 1% to 0.9%. But it is clear from the measure of input prices paid by manufacturers that a wave of inflation is coming through the pipeline driven by a weaker pound. We should therefore still expect to see inflation at around 3% or just below by the end of next year. That will squeeze real consumer spending growth, adding to the slowdown generated by uncertainty affecting investment plans. PwC\u2019s updated forecast is for GDP to rise by just 1.2% next year \u2013 about half the growth rate over the past 12 months. The EU referendum vote seems likely to create a longer-term drag on economic activity rather than a short sharp shock. The chancellor should be focusing on long-term priorities in his autumn statement this week \u2013 relieving the pressure in the housing market by supporting supply, boosting transport investment, helping smaller firms, tax reform and investment in skills. Business should view an autumn statement focused on long-term priorities positively and this is the best way to support business confidence in the face of Brexit uncertainty.",

To put this in context, the UK has 29,145 miles of main roads 2,173 miles of motorways and 213,750 miles of paved roads so that should cover the cost of filling in about one pothole a mile. Or put another way, it is equivalent to about a fifth of the cost of refurbishing the Houses of Parliament and Buckingham Palace. </p> <p>Too little too late as ever. Oh dear.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"ff7d9893a135414eb98bdc66f495f496de2b6be9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ff7d9893a135414eb98bdc66f495f496de2b6be9/1421_0_6273_3766/1000.jpg\" alt=\"New Queensferry crossing in Scotland\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Philip Hammond looks set to respond to the slowing economy with a trifling \u00a31.3bn on infrastructure and roads\u2019 \u2013<strong> </strong>David Blanchflower</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Murdo Macleod for the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Andrew Sentance, senior economic adviser at the consultancy PwC and former member of the Bank\u2019s MPC from October 2006 to May 2011</strong></p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/24/brexit-economy-falling-pound-rising-inflation-fuel-fears-brexit-watch\">The picture of the UK economy since the Brexit vote is that consumer spending and services activity are supporting growth and employment</a>. We still don\u2019t have any hard data on the investment side of the economy \u2013 but even when we do it may be several quarters before the impact of post-Brexit uncertainty shows up in the level of capital spending.</p> <p>GDP held up in the third quarter better than expected and the early data for the current quarter \u2013 on retail sales and the purchasing managers\u2019 survey of services activity \u2013 has been positive. The unemployment rate has continued to fall, though the rate of growth of new job creation appears to be slowing.<br></p> <p>One surprise this month was a drop in the inflation rate, from 1% to 0.9%. But it is clear from the measure of input prices paid by manufacturers that a wave of inflation is coming through the pipeline driven by a weaker pound. We should therefore still expect to see inflation at around 3% or just below by the end of next year. That will squeeze real consumer spending growth, adding to the slowdown generated by uncertainty affecting investment plans.</p> <p>PwC\u2019s updated forecast is for GDP to rise by just 1.2% next year \u2013 about half the growth rate over the past 12 months. The EU referendum vote seems likely to create a longer-term drag on economic activity rather than a short sharp shock.</p> <p>The chancellor should be focusing on long-term priorities in his autumn statement this week \u2013 relieving the pressure in the housing market by supporting supply, boosting transport investment, helping smaller firms, tax reform and investment in skills. Business should view an autumn statement focused on long-term priorities positively and this is the best way to support business confidence in the face of Brexit uncertainty.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Mitchells &amp; Butlers has warned of problems ahead as the pubs group reported a dip in full year revenues and profits. The Harvester and All Bar One owner said like for like sales fell 0.8% although they showed an improvement in the most recent eight weeks, with profits dropping from \u00a3328m to \u00a3318m. Chief executive Phil Urban said: Sales growth in the first eight weeks was impacted by the Rugby World Cup in the prior year, but I\u2019m encouraged by the underlying momentum which has seen recent weeks return to the levels seen in the summer. In the next year, as previously announced, we face external cost headwinds, notably from further wage inflation, the recent business rates review and exchange rate movements. We are working hard to mitigate these headwinds wherever possible, both through building on our sales momentum and active management of our cost base. On the Brexit vote specifically, the company said the slump in sterling since the referendum would increase food and drink costs: We believe it is too early to predict with any certainty what the impact of Brexit on the economy might be, particularly without clarity on exit terms. However there are broadly three areas in which Brexit may affect us in the medium to long term: changes in consumer confidence and behaviour; changes to employment and immigration laws; and changes to input costs. The first two of the three are largely unknown at present, and therefore our approach is to stay close to developments whilst continuing to support all our 43,000 employees. Input costs will be impacted by the value of sterling, which has fallen significantly since the EU referendum. We have a small number of sites trading in Germany, but otherwise our international trade is defined by our supply chain. The net effect of a weaker sterling is therefore profit dilutive due to the food and drink which is purchased in foreign currency, although this is partially mitigated in the next financial year by existing contracts. The downbeat tone has sent the group\u2019s shares 14.9p lower to 258.6p. Investec analyst Karl Burns said: Mitchells &amp; Butler has announced 2016 results to the end of September, with the results in line with our forecasts and consensus. However, unsurprisingly, management have provided cautious guidance around margins looking ahead to 2017 due to the negative impact of the Living Wage, business rates and movement in foreign exchange, all likely to result in downward pressure on margins. We retain our forecasts, which are around 4% below consensus, and retain our 174p price target and sell recommendation. Numis said the impact of business rate rises was higher than it expected: Mitchells has quantified the impact of the business rate review at \u00a318m, with \u00a35m in 2017. We had estimated a total impact of \u00a312m in our recent sector note. The total will have a 90 basis point impact on margin by year five. We are cautious on the outlook for M&amp;B as we do not expect like for like sales to cover mounting cost headwinds and see a risk of the majority of free cash flow being required for the pension deficit recovery plan (to be announced in 2017). But Canaccord Genuity was more positive: Mitchells &amp; Butlers reported prelims a fraction below our expectations but there\u2019s a fragile but improving trend developing. The fine summer weather has been helpful but it\u2019s only part of the story, like for likes have been recovering for six months and the positive momentum has continued into the new year. We don\u2019t anticipate material revisions to forecasts and reiterate our buy recommendation. The stock is oversold in our view and our 350p target price implies 28% potential upside.",

      "bodyText": "Britain\u2019s public finances improved in October with a fall in the monthly deficit to \u00a34.8bn from \u00a36.4bn in the same month last year, giving the chancellor a lift ahead of Wednesday\u2019s autumn statement. Healthy increases in national insurance contributions, corporation tax and stamp duty on shares helped boost government coffers and put Philip Hammond in a better position to ease austerity. But the damage to growth following the Brexit vote is still expected to force the Treasury to miss its target of \u00a355.5bn by the year end by about \u00a310bn. Since the financial year started in April public sector net borrowing excluding public sector banks was already \u00a348.6bn. This was only 10.3% down on the year before against Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) forecasts of a fall of about a quarter. Scott Bowman, UK economist at Capital Economics, said: \u201cWhile Hammond would have welcomed this morning\u2019s improvement in the public finances, it is unlikely to be a sign of things to come in tomorrow\u2019s autumn statement. \u201cThe borrowing overshoot, along with weaker forecasts for GDP growth ahead, should prevent the chancellor from being too bold tomorrow. Indeed, we think that the OBR will present Mr Hammond with forecasts for borrowing that are about \u00a335bn higher in 2019-20 than the previous forecast,\u201d he said. Central government receipts were up 6.8% year-on-year in October 2016, lifted by a 23.6% year-on-year gain in corporation tax receipts and 6.4% jump in national insurance contributions, offset by a 2.4% dip in income tax receipts, with the government\u2019s raising of the personal threshold having a bigger than expected impact on income. Howard Archer, chief UK economist at IHS Global Insight, said the chancellor needed to factor into the public finances higher interest payments on government debts and higher inflation costs. \u201cAnd, of course, markedly slowing growth over the coming months will take a toll on tax receipts \u2013 although this is likely to show up more after the current fiscal year.\u201d The Treasury said: \u201cAs the chancellor has made clear, the government is committed to fiscal discipline and will return the budget to balance over a sensible period of time, in a way that allows space to support the economy as needed.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "This year\u2019s Black Friday will be the biggest yet as shoppers snap up large items such as fridges before Brexit-induced price rises take effect in January, the boss of AO World has predicted. John Roberts, the online retailer\u2019s chief executive, said price rises were inevitable after the pound\u2019s plunge against other major currencies since the EU referendum. Suppliers were starting to charge more and shoppers would feel the full impact by the end of January, he said. AO\u2019s founder said the expectation of imminent price rises would add to consumer willingness to buy new products in the shopping frenzy around the last Friday of November. The period of heavy discounts has taken off since the tradition was imported from the US in 2010. Roberts said: \u201cIt has been well reported that with Brexit currency movements prices are going up early next year, so there is a double whammy for customers. So our belief is it will be bigger than ever.\u201d AO posted a \u00a31.1m operating loss for the six months to the end of September, with an \u00a311.1m UK profit erased by a \u00a312.2m loss in mainland Europe, where it is expanding in Germany and the Netherlands. The group recorded a \u00a36.8m loss a year earlier but Roberts predicted the European business would turn a profit in 2020. The pound\u2019s fall against the dollar, the euro and other currencies since the Brexit vote is pushing up prices of goods from Marmite to guitars as suppliers charge more to make up for sterling\u2019s reduced value. Rising prices threaten to squeeze living standards and slow the economy but retail sales are holding up better than expected, with Christmas a few weeks away. Britons are expected to spend \u00a32.9bn over the four days from Friday 25 November, 38% more than on Black Friday weekend last year, according to the accountants PricewaterhouseCoopers. Most of the extra sales will be made online as shoppers shun the chaos and occasional punch-ups in stores by ordering from their computer or mobile device. Some retailers are phasing their discounts or seeking to play down Black Friday. Amazon, which brought the craze to the UK, is spreading its offers over two weeks while Asda has largely opted out, as it did last year. Research by Which? also found many Black Friday offers last year cost more than at other times. It criticised AO and Currys for advertising discounts that were bigger than claimed. Roberts said AO\u2019s prices were transparent and he predicted Black Friday would be the biggest shopping day of the year. He said Black Friday was here to stay whether retailers liked it or not. \u201cThe genie is out of the bottle \u2026 to go back to customers now and say Black Friday didn\u2019t work for existing retailers and we are going to go back to charging full price \u2013 it won\u2019t work with customers.\u201d Roberts founded AO as Appliances online in 2000 for a \u00a31 bet. It mainly sells fridges, washing machines and other white goods but has branched out into televisions and computers. The company\u2019s shares, which are up 5% this year, fell 2.3% to 164p in early trading.",

      "bodyText": "Leading shares are moving higher, following Wall Street\u2019s record breaking performance on Monday, despite a couple of high profile declines. Compass is down 54p or nearly 4% at \u00a313.37 after the catering group reported a 5% rise in full year revenues to \u00a319.9bn - just below expectations - and a 5.6% increase in profit to \u00a31.44bn. The company pointed to strong demand in the US and said it was positive about the coming year, but said growth would be weighted to the second half of the year. Analysts pointed to slowing momentum, with Wyn Ellis at Numis saying: Compass\u2019s full year results are marginally disappointing with operating profit of \u00a31,445m compared to our forecast of \u00a31,448m, but with organic growth slowing to, we estimate, around 4% in the fourth quarter (+5.6% for quarters one to three, after 5.8% growth in the first half) making +5.0% for the full year (North America +8.1%; Europe +2.8%; rest of the world excluding offshore and remote, +3.6%). Operating margin is flat at 7.2% but the full year dividend is up 7.8% to 31.7p, in-line with the 7.8% increase in constant currency earnings per share. In a hold note Jefferies said: Preliminary earnings per share is in line with our estimate and 1% ahead of consensus despite a slowdown in organic revenue to 3.1% in fourth quarter, driven by Europe and the rest of the world. Consequently, although outlook comments are upbeat, they reiterate Sodexo\u2019s recent message that momentum will be second half weighted in 2017. Greg Johnson at Shore Capital also issued a hold recommendation: Compass remains a quality company but on a 2017 PE of 20 times, an EV/EBITDA of 13 times and a free cash flow yield of 4% this appears full factored into the valuation for a stock capable of delivering high single digit compound earnings growth, in our view. Kingfisher has also disappointed, with shares in the B&amp;Q and Castorama business down 10.4p to 359.3p, albeit they have risen 12% this year. The company reported like for like third quarter sales up 1.8% with strong performances in Britain and Poland but a weak outcome in France. In a sell note, Investec said: Similar third quarter trends to the first half, with France weak, the UK robust and Poland strong. The shares have held up versus the sector post the Brexit vote, due to foreign exchange benefits (International around 60% retail profits) rather than underlying trading, with Group sales up just 1.3% at constant currency. Valuation does not reflect our view that a weak French market is likely to deteriorate in 2017 given the election and that the UK is also likely to slow on our assumption of weakening consumer demand. Our target price is upped to 275p (previously 265p) reflecting a changed peer group, but sell reiterated. And Babcock is also down after its latest update, 31p lower at 960p despite a 7% rise in half year profits and a reiteration of its full year targets. Overall the FTSE 100 is up 62.45 points at 6840.41, helped by better than expected UK public finance figures ahead of the Autumn Statement and a continuing rise in the crude price on hopes of an Opec output deal. The increase in oil and positive comments from Goldman Sach have lifted commodity companies once more, with Anglo American adding 63p to 1185.5p and BHP Billiton 57.5p better at \u00a313.29. Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at IG, said: Equities are almost universally higher this morning, as London traders woke to news that US markets had posted record closes across the board. The week before Thanksgiving is never a good time to be short, since those of a bearish disposition tend to suffer a fate akin to a roasted turkey. Goldman Sachs\u2019 decision to turn into commodity bulls has bolstered the London mining community, aside from precious metals miners, with the investment bank remaining downbeat on the outlook for gold. Elsewhere Entertainment One is down 23p at 222.8p after a fall in first half profits, but Inmarsat has climbed 29p to 730p as Deutsche Bank began coverage with a buy recommendation and a 1030p price target. It said: We acknowledge that the Inmarsat thesis centres on the concept of in-flight communication gaining real traction and at present there are mixed views, but we see scope for Inmarsat unlocking value given the size of the market. We have carried out bottom-up analysis of the market potential for in-flight communication and around 40% of our target relates to the European aviation opportunity. Given Inmarsat has underperformed the Telco sector by 16% year to date, we see current levels as a good entry to gain exposure to strong growth.",

      "bodyText": "The UK saw $1.5tn (\u00a31.2tn) wiped off its wealth during 2016 after the Brexit vote sent the pound tumbling and the stock market into reverse, according to a survey by Credit Suisse. A fall in values at the top-end of the property market also contributed to about 400,000 Britons losing their status as dollar millionaires and one of the biggest drops in wealth among the major economies. But the UK remained third for the number of ultra-high-net-worth individuals, who own more than \u00a350m in assets, behind the US and China. Across the globe, the richest 1% own more wealth than the rest of the world put together, continuing the dominance seen in last year\u2019s report. A recovering in the global stock markets in recent weeks is also likely to reverse some of the losses suffered by pension savers and wealthy individuals. Oxfam said the huge gap between rich and poor was \u201cundermining economies, destabilising societies and holding back the fight against poverty\u201d. It said a separate study by the investment bank showed the UK\u2019s top 1% richest people continued to own 24% of the nation\u2019s wealth. The findings from the Credit Suisse Research Institute\u2019s seventh annual global wealth report that found the overall growth in global wealth remained flat in 2016, following a trend that emerged in 2013 and contrasting sharply with the double-digit growth rates witnessed before the global financial crisis of 2008. Michael O\u2019Sullivan, chief investment officer in Credit Suisse\u2019s wealth management arm: \u201cThe impact of the Brexit vote is widely thought of in terms of GDP but the impact on household wealth bears watching. \u201cSince the Brexit vote, UK household wealth has fallen by $1.5tn. Wealth per adult has already dropped by $33,000 to $289,000 since the end of June. In fact, in US dollar terms, 406,000 people in the UK are no longer millionaires.\u201d The report found that total global wealth in 2016 edged up 1.4%, or $3.5tn, to $256tn in line with the increase in the world\u2019s adult population. Accordingly, average wealth per adult of $52,800 remains in line with last year\u2019s figures. The number of millionaires globally increased by 155%, while the number of ultra-high-net-worth individuals has risen by 216%, making them by far the fastest-growing group of wealth holders. More than 90% of the wealthiest people in the world live in developed nations, mostly the US, but the rise of millionaires and ultra-high-net-worth individuals (UHNWIs) in China meant there was a shift to emerging economies in recent years. Credit Suisse said: \u201cThis century, no other segments of the wealth pyramid have developed as significantly as the millionaire and UHNWI segments. The number of millionaires is projected to reach 45.1 million by 2021, while the number of UHNWIs could reach 208,000, up from 141,000.\u201d The US hosted the highest number of UHNWIs with 56,000 followed by China with around 9,000, the UK in third place with 5,000. Oxfam said it was clear from the survey that the wealthiest are holding their own while those on lower incomes are struggling. Spokeswoman Sally Copley said: \u201cThe wealthiest one percent of the population - who own nearly a quarter of all the country\u2019s wealth \u2013 continue to do well whilst so many people in Britain are just about managing to stay above the poverty line. \u201cTomorrow\u2019s autumn statement presents a real opportunity for the government to show how they are going to make the economy work for everyone and not just those at the very top,\u201d she said. \u2022 This article was amended on 22 November to clarify that the figure for the top 1% richest people owning 24% of the nation\u2019s wealth came from a separate Credit Suisse report",

      "bodyText": "The delivery firm CitySprint is to become the latest British business embroiled in a legal dispute over the gig economy when it faces demands at an employment tribunal to treat its freelance couriers as workers. Mags Dewhurst, who has made deliveries for the firm for more than two years, will argue on Tuesday that she should be given worker status, and the rights that come with it, such as holiday pay and the national minimum wage. The case is the first of four against different courier firms that will be heard by the same judge. The other cases, against Addison Lee, eCourier and Excel, will be heard next year. Jason Moyer-Lee, the head of the Independent Workers Union of Great Britain (IWGB), which is backing the riders, said the cyclists worked for one company at a time and were obliged to take work they were given throughout the day. He said independent contractors were able to send others to do their work, but that was not possible for Dewhurst and the other riders. \u201cEven though the courier firms say Mags can send a substitute, she can\u2019t really, as there are restrictions that prevent that,\u201d he said. Moyer-Lee said the point of the cases was to test the status of the workers. CitySprint, which has 3,500 self-employed couriers in the UK, could face further claims if the tribunal finds against it. Dewhurst said: \u201cI\u2019m taking this action because I have personal experience of [earning], and know many courier friends earn, below the national minimum wage. Our lives tend to be thrown into financial chaos when we want to go on holiday. \u201cWorker status will finally redress some of the balance between couriers and courier companies, and transform our lives for the better. These benefits have for too long been withheld by courier companies and only serve to make it easier for them to exploit their workforce. It is time to afford couriers some basic employment rights.\u201d An employment tribunal last month found in favour of drivers for the taxi-hailing firm Uber, who argued that they should be classed as workers. Uber has appealed against the ruling. Moyer-Lee said: \u201cWe were confident before the Uber case. [Dewhurst] fits all the criteria [of a worker] \u2013 so does pretty much any other pushbike courier I\u2019ve met.\u201d Matt Gingell, an employment law partner at Gannons Solicitors, said: \u201cThe employment tribunal may well be influenced by the Uber decision. But that judgment is not binding and the facts will be different in these cases.\u201d A spokesman for CitySprint said: \u201cWe can confirm we have received notification of a tribunal claim. As you will appreciate, due to the legal process we cannot comment any further on this at this stage.\u201d The tribunal is expected to start hearing evidence from witnesses on Wednesday. \u2022 This article was amended on 22 November 2016 to correct employment terminology.",
