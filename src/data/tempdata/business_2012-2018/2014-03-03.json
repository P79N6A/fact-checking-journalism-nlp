While KKR owns about 85% of the company, the management team are in line for cash and share payments worth more than \u00a320m, according to the firm's prospectus.</p> <p>KKR's payout could rise further as it will release another tranche of shares if the offer is oversubscribed.

It was the first payment since KKR, the firm whose 1980s takeover activities inspired the book Barbarians at the Gate, bought the company for \u00a3995m in 2010.</p> <p>A group of around 500 middle managers own approximately 10% of the company and are being allowed to cash in.</p> <p>The prospectus also details that the roster of adviser banks, which includes Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Goldman Sachs and Nomura, will earn \u00a340m for their work on the IPO.

      "bodyText": "The \u00a31.3bn stock market listing of Pets at Home could reap more than \u00a3200m for private equity firm KKR, while the investment bankers running the process stand to collect \u00a340m in fees. If there is strong demand for shares in the specialist retailer, which sells everything from goldfish to dog kennels, some \u00a3209m will be returned to existing shareholders. While KKR owns about 85% of the company, the management team are in line for cash and share payments worth more than \u00a320m, according to the firm's prospectus. KKR's payout could rise further as it will release another tranche of shares if the offer is oversubscribed. After the windfall KKR will still be left with a minority stake in the retailer worth hundreds of millions. Pets at Home is part of a stampede of retailers rushing to take advantage of buoyant equity markets. On Friday the retailer said its shares would be priced at between 210p and 260p each, implying a market capitalisation of between \u00a31.05bn and \u00a31.3bn. If there are buyers at the top end of that price band its chief executive Nick Wood intends to sell a tranche of shares worth \u00a34.8m while retaining a 1.1% stake worth \u00a314.3m. Chairman Tony DeNunzio will crystallise \u00a32.8m while Ian Kellett, its finance director, will collect \u00a33.6m. Sally Hopson, the customer and people director, stands to collect \u00a32.9m while commercial director Peter Pritchard and Phil Hackney, the logistics director, will get \u00a32.8m and \u00a31.8m respectively. The payday is on top of a \u00a3130.4m dividend shared among shareholders last year. It was the first payment since KKR, the firm whose 1980s takeover activities inspired the book Barbarians at the Gate, bought the company for \u00a3995m in 2010. A group of around 500 middle managers own approximately 10% of the company and are being allowed to cash in. The prospectus also details that the roster of adviser banks, which includes Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Goldman Sachs and Nomura, will earn \u00a340m for their work on the IPO. KKR Capital Markets, an offshoot of the private equity firm, is being paid a \u00a3400,000 fee for arranging a loan, according to the document. The proceeds from the IPO are being used to reduce the retailer's overall debt burden. A chunk of the \u00a3351m it plans to raise will be used to repay a bank syndicate.

Russia and Georgia fought a brief war in August 2008 over the disputed territory of South Ossetia, which has many similarities with recent developments in Ukraine. The key point is that the conflict was short-lived and ended by an EU-sponsored ceasefire. Russian forces still occupy South Ossetia which has now declared independence from Georgia, a position that very few other countries officially recognise but no-one can realistically do anything about. A similar outcome in Crimea would soon drop out of the daily headlines (as have the ongoing tragedies in Syria and South Sudan).</p> <p>Second, though, Ukraine is roughly ten times larger than Georgia in terms of population (45 million vs. 5 million) and GDP ($180bn vs. $16bn). Ukraine\u2019s financial markets and external debts are correspondingly much greater and it is a more credible candidate for EU membership in due course. Indeed, unlike Georgia, Ukraine shares borders with four current EU members. Third, regional turmoil could also have a major impact on the Russian economy itself and on its trade, particularly in energy, with the rest of the world. The country\u2019s financial markets and currency have already been hit hard, prompting an emergency rate hike Monday morning in an attempt to stem capital outflows.</p> <p>Two specific risks are worth dwelling on. One is the possibility of the disruption to the supply of Russian energy to the European Union, whether as a result of Western sanctions or Russian manipulation. Russia is of course a major supplier of oil to Germany and the Netherlands in particular and of natural gas to Western Europe generally. However, disruption to energy trade would be in neither side\u2019s interest, especially Russia\u2019s as it would simply encourage EU customers to seek more secure supplies elsewhere. We suspect that any Western sanctions will only target individuals and political and cultural links, rather than trade.</p> <p>The other issue is the financial burden of supporting Ukraine. The country needs around $25bn soon to refinance debt and pay other bills for goods and services. Over the longer-term, the cost of supporting the transition could run into the hundreds of billions of dollars. These are not particularly large sums when measured against the combined resources of the IMF and the major advanced economies who might be willing to offer bilateral support. Nonetheless, every dollar spent on Ukraine is a dollar not available to finance bailouts elsewhere, including the weaker economies of the euro-zone. &lt;end&gt;</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2014-03-03T17:35:30.688Z\">at 5.35pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5314b581e4b093d4729c3120\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2014-03-03T17:07:09.317Z\">5.07pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><b>Update - the German DAX has now officially closed, and it\u2019s an even deeper fall than initially thought.</b></p> <p>Germany\u2019s index of leading shares tumbled 333.19 points to 9,358, a drop of 3.44%.</p> <p>That\u2019s very slightly worse than the 3.41% tumble on 1 June 2012.

The potential of the situation to deepen and intensify remains large.</strong></h2> <p>Russia has been known to be unpredictable in the past and its aggressive and quick action in the region, along with parliamentary backing for further troop deployment not just in Crimea but the Ukraine as well, shows that it remains steadfast to increase its presence in the region. Russia has historically shown that it will protect its assets and people without hesitation. This is exactly what it is doing.</p> <h2><strong>2. The reaction of the G7 is crucial.</strong></h2> <p>Do they call Russia\u2019s bluff? Even if Ukraine strikes at Russian troops in the Crimea region, it will still be the response of the G7 that holds the key for complete market volatility and fear. It\u2019s hard to see at this stage, with Russia holding all the cards, for the west to dramatically do anything other than appease Russian aggression.<br></p> <h2><strong>3. A quick look at oil prices shows the impact this situation could have.</strong></h2> <p>Nymex front month oil futures prices hit their highest level since September last year, hitting $104 a barrel. Further oil price rises will have a knock-on effect on stocks and sectors that rely on a stable oil price to keep fundamental costs down. Rising oil prices is a direct threat to the ability of stocks to rally in the near term. This needs to be watched.<br></p> <h2><strong>4. Key indices have also hit major resistance levels</strong></h2> <p>The crisis could give investors the excuse they need for a 5%-10% market correction. </p> <p>Market corrections are healthy for the long term bullishness of major indices and as such, should not be feared. However, with the FTSE 100, DAX and Dow Jones all recently hitting levels which triggered selling, a small price correction could now be due. So if anything, the timing of the Ukraine crisis may have well triggered the inevitable.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-531478f2e4b093d4729c30e1\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2014-03-03T12:45:06.083Z\">12.45pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><b>Stephanie Flanders, </b>JP Morgan\u2019s chief market strategist for UK and Europe (<i>and former BBC economics editor</i>) suggests today\u2019s heavy selloff in Russian stocks has created some real bargains for investors:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\u201cEvents in Ukraine have clearly pushed investors into \u201crisk-off\u201d mode, especially when it comes to emerging market assets. Aside from this short-term volatility, we would still say the direct economic and financial fallout from Ukraine itself was fairly limited - though markets are perhaps not focused enough on the broader contagion that could follow a messy Ukrainian sovereign default.</p> <p>However, Russia\u2019s involvement clearly magnifies the scope for contagion and increases the possibility that global energy prices will be affected both directly and indirectly, because of Russia\u2019s previous negotiating role in the Middle East.</p> <p>We have been saying for some time that emerging market assets look cheap, and Russia\u2019s looked cheaper than most.

The MICEX index closed down 10.7%, with several major companies dropping at least 20%, in as a \u201cselling spree\u201d gripped the Moscow market. The ruble has also hit record lows against the US dollar. The selloff prompted the Russian central bank to spend at least $10bn propping up its currency, having hiked interest rates from 5.5% to 7% early this morning. In Europe, the FTSE 100 fell 101 points while Germany\u2019s DAX suffered its biggest one-day fall since the height of the eurozone crisis - down 3.4% by the close. On Wall Street, the Dow Jones index has joined the selloff-- down 184 points, a drop of 1.3%, in afternoon trading. The crisis has forced Austria\u2019s third-largest bank, Raiffeisen, has put the sale of its Ukrainian division, Bank Aval,on hold. Money has surged into government bonds, driving down the interest rates on US and UK bonds.... ...although some analysts, including JP Morgan\u2019s Stephanie Flanders, reckons some Russian assets look pretty affordable now. But there is optimism over the US economy after two manufacturing surveys beat forecasts. Both the ISM and Markit found that factory growth picked up last month. And Bill Gates has become the world\u2019s richest person, again. Our earlier lunchtime summary has the key points from this morning. And that\u2019s all for today. Do keep watching our main Ukraine crisis blog for the latest news tonight. Thanks. GW Here\u2019s the highlights of the latest summary from our main Ukraine live blog: The Russian military presence in Crimea continued to build, with troops massing outside Ukrainian military facilities, patrol boats sighted and Russian forces establishing control of both sides of the Kerch channel separating Crimea from Russia. The Russian foreign ministry warned that Nato criticism of its activity in Crimea \u201cwill not help stabilise the situation in Ukraine.\u201d On Sunday Nato said it \u201ccondemns the Russian Federation\u2019s military escalation in Crimea.\u201d US vice president Joe Biden, in a call with Russian prime minister Dmitry Medvedev, urged Russia to pull back its forces. Medvedev saidit was necessary to protect all Russians including those in Ukraine. Russia has requested a third emergency meeting of the UN security council over the crisis in Ukraine. More here And there are reports that EU leaders will meet to discuss the Ukraine crisis on Thursday: Meanwhile in Spain, Christine Lagarde has sparked a row by telling an event in Bilbao that the Spanish labour market requires further reform. Lagarde told the Global Forum on Spain in Bilbao that: Thanks to the formidable actions over the past five years, Europe \u2013 and Spain \u2013are now turning the corner. Yet the task is far from finished. Growth remains too low and unemployment too high for us to declare victory on the crisis. She then insisted that the \u201cstrong reform momentum must be maintained\u201d, and that reforms \u201cshould not benefit those in work but those without it\u201d. Our correspondent in Spain, Stephen Burgen, reports that the IMF chief was immediately attacked for, in effect, advocating more wage cuts: Joaqu\u00edn Almunia, the European competition commissioner, who was also in Bilbao, criticised Lagarde for calling for wage cuts, which he said would be \u201cneither sensitive, reasonable nor fair\u201d. \u201cSacrifice has to be shared, and economists should not demand what is not viable in practice,\u201d he said. More here: Christine Lagarde angers Spain with repeat prescription of austerity The Russian ruble is still hovering at its lowest ever levels against the US dollar tonight. It is changing hands around at 36.5 to the dollar, a drop of 1.5%, despite its central bank spending at least $10bn to support the currency - and this morning\u2019s emergency interest rate hike. Capital Economics just issued research note on the Ukraine crisis, by their analyst Julian Jessop. He reckons the fallout of Russia\u2019s incursion into Crimea could be short-lived, but also compares the crisis to the 2008 conflict with Georgia - and concludes by suggesting an IMF-led bailout of Ukraine could leave less money to help eurozone countries in future. I\u2019ve pasted part of it below: Fallout from Ukraine rattles global markets More generally, there are a number of points to make about history, economics and the financial market implications. First, we have been here before. Russia and Georgia fought a brief war in August 2008 over the disputed territory of South Ossetia, which has many similarities with recent developments in Ukraine. The key point is that the conflict was short-lived and ended by an EU-sponsored ceasefire. Russian forces still occupy South Ossetia which has now declared independence from Georgia, a position that very few other countries officially recognise but no-one can realistically do anything about. A similar outcome in Crimea would soon drop out of the daily headlines (as have the ongoing tragedies in Syria and South Sudan). Second, though, Ukraine is roughly ten times larger than Georgia in terms of population (45 million vs. 5 million) and GDP ($180bn vs. $16bn). Ukraine\u2019s financial markets and external debts are correspondingly much greater and it is a more credible candidate for EU membership in due course. Indeed, unlike Georgia, Ukraine shares borders with four current EU members. Third, regional turmoil could also have a major impact on the Russian economy itself and on its trade, particularly in energy, with the rest of the world. The country\u2019s financial markets and currency have already been hit hard, prompting an emergency rate hike Monday morning in an attempt to stem capital outflows. Two specific risks are worth dwelling on. One is the possibility of the disruption to the supply of Russian energy to the European Union, whether as a result of Western sanctions or Russian manipulation. Russia is of course a major supplier of oil to Germany and the Netherlands in particular and of natural gas to Western Europe generally. However, disruption to energy trade would be in neither side\u2019s interest, especially Russia\u2019s as it would simply encourage EU customers to seek more secure supplies elsewhere. We suspect that any Western sanctions will only target individuals and political and cultural links, rather than trade. The other issue is the financial burden of supporting Ukraine. The country needs around $25bn soon to refinance debt and pay other bills for goods and services. Over the longer-term, the cost of supporting the transition could run into the hundreds of billions of dollars. These are not particularly large sums when measured against the combined resources of the IMF and the major advanced economies who might be willing to offer bilateral support. Nonetheless, every dollar spent on Ukraine is a dollar not available to finance bailouts elsewhere, including the weaker economies of the euro-zone.  Update - the German DAX has now officially closed, and it\u2019s an even deeper fall than initially thought. Germany\u2019s index of leading shares tumbled 333.19 points to 9,358, a drop of 3.44%. That\u2019s very slightly worse than the 3.41% tumble on 1 June 2012. Josh Raymond of City Index says its the biggest decline since November 2011, when the eurozone crisis was raging. The selloff is picking up pace on Wall Street, where the Dow Jones is now off 211 points or 1.3%. As our main Ukraine liveblog reports, Russia has now requested a UN security council meeting later tonight to discuss the situation. Nervy investors have fled shares in favour of safe government debt. The price of US Treasury bills has risen today, pushing down the yield (interest rate) on 10-year US debt to 2.6%, from 2.65% on Friday. British gilts also rallied, with the yield on 10-year UK debt down at 2.65% from 2.72%. Phil Orlando, chief equity market strategist at Federated investors, said it was a classic flight away from risk: \u201cWe just have no way of knowing how this is going to play out...It\u2019s a very uncertain situation and the market is demonstrating its unhappiness with that.\u201d (quote via AP) Big losses in London too, where the FTSE 100 has just closed down 101 points at 6708, a fall of almost 1.5%. European stock markets have closed with heavy losses across the board, as events in the Crimean peninsula hit investor confidence hard. The German DAX provisionally ended 3.3% lower, in its biggest one-day fall since May 2012 (as explained at 4.04pm, many firms have big exposure to the Russian economy). Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB also shed 3.3%, with Unicredit bank dragged down almost 6% by fears over its exposure to Ukraine. Franc\u2019s CAC fell 2.7%, and the Spanish IBEX dropped 1.5%. And the EuroSTOXX bank index, which tracks financial stocks across the region, slid 3.8% -- in its biggest one-day fall since last August. Stat of the day: The Ukraine crisis continues to drive the wheat price higher. It\u2019s currently up 4% in the London futures market, reflecting concerns that supplies from the world\u2019s fifth-largest supplier could be hit. The other Russian stock index, RTS, fell even further: Investors in Moscow are nursing the cost of Vladimir Putin\u2019s decision to send troops into Crimea tonight. The MICEX index closed down 10.7% at a nine-month low, with every share on the index losing ground. Mostotrest, the biggest Russian heavy construction company, tumbled by 25% today. It was followed by electricity transmission firm Rosseti, down 22.8%. Mining firm Mechel lost a fifth of its value. The prospect of the situation escalating further drove a wave of selling in Moscow through the day, wiping more than $50bn off the index by the close. Dmitry Kulakov, head of equity trading at Olma investment house, bluntly summed it up: Frightened by the situation around Ukraine, investors held a selling spree of Russian assets. A string of big-name German companies have seen their share prices hit today by the Ukraine crisis. That has sent Germany\u2019s DAX down 2.9% in late trading, making it the worst-performing major stock index outside Moscow. Major industrial firms and manufacturers dominate the biggest fallers on the DAX this afternoon, including chemicals maker BASF,pharmaceuticals firm Bayer, auto maker Volkswagen, and Siemens. Michal Hewson of CMC Markets explains: The German DAX has borne the brunt of European market losses today given that German companies do an awful lot of business with Russia. After an hour\u2019s trading in New York, the Dow Jones industrial average remains firmly in red - now down 150 points, or 0.95%, at 16168. Manufacturing giant and conglomerate General Electric is the biggest faller, down 1.7%. Financial stocks are under pressure, with JP Morgan and Goldman Sachs both down around 1.2%. Nigel Green, founder and CEO of deVere Group, a wealth management firm, reckons today\u2019s market selloff is a \u201cbump in the road\u201d rather than the start of a crash. Sounding pretty upbeat, Green declared: \u201cI\u2019m not worried that we are about to slump into another global recession as a consequence of the deepening crisis in Ukraine.\u201d ...and reckons stock markets will soon be more sanguine about the escalating tensions in the region: \u201cAs the situation regularises, in whichever form that might take, and the world becomes accustomed to the new and/or existing realities, investors are likely to classify the Ukraine-Russia stand-off as \u2018a local issue.\u2019 \u201cGlobal financial markets will then return to focusing on key fundamentals, such as the improving trend of US economic data, than to what is happening in Ukraine.\u201d We\u2019ll know in a few weeks if he\u2019s right.... David Crow, assistant news editor at the Financial Times, flags up that the \u00a334bn wiped off the Russian MICEX index today (see 1.56pm), is actually more than the cost of the Sochi Olympics: The ISM survey of America\u2019s manufacturing sector has beaten forecasts, mirroring Markit\u2019s survey an hour ago (see 2.13pm) The Institute for Supply Management\u2019s healthcheck of factory activity jumped to 53.2, up from January\u2019s 51.9, which was disappointingly weak. That indicates growth accelerated as new orders picked up after bad weather cause disruption at the start of 2014. Austria\u2019s third-largest bank, Raiffeisen, has put the sale of its Ukrainian division, Bank Aval, on hold following the latest developments in the country. A spokeswoman for the bank tells us: Various parties with interest in purchasing Raiffeisen Bank Aval have approached RBI already some months ago. A possible sale of our Ukrainian operations is on hold for now, however, due to the situation in Ukraine. FastFT has more details here, explaining that Bank Aval operates 818 branches in Ukraine and has 3.1m customers. Raiffeisen\u2019s shares are down 8% today. It is thought to be one of the banks with the biggest exposure to Ukrainian debt (more details). The New York stock market has opened, and shares are falling as expected. The Dow Jones industrial average shed 132 points, or 0.8%, at the first few minutes of trading to 16190. The technology stock-heavy Nasdaq index dropped 1.1%, and the S&amp;P 500 is down 0.8%. Gold, though, is up 1.5% at $1,347/ounce, gaining $20 today. Joao Monteiro, analyst at Valutrades explaines: Investors sought safer havens such as gold and fled equities after the United States\u2019 government conceded that Russia now has control of Crimea in Ukraine. Reminder: my colleague Haroon Siddique is liveblogging all the action from Ukraine, here. The latest line is that the Russian foreign ministry has said that US secretary of state John Kerry\u2019s recent comments on the crisis are \u2018unacceptable\u201d, and contained threats against Russia. The US stock market is expected to follow Europe\u2019s lead when Wall Street opens in around 10 minutes. The Dow Jones industrial average is tipped to fall at least 100 points, having closed at 16,321 on Friday night, before Russian troops crossed the Ukranian border. Here\u2019s the situation in Europe right now. FTSE 100: down 100 points at 6709, -1.5% German DAX: down 287 points at 9404, -2.96% French CAC: down 104 points at 4303, -2.4% America\u2019s factory sector grew faster than expected in February, according to Markit\u2019s monthly survey. The US manufacturing PMI jumped to 57.1, up from 56.7 in January. That may calm concerns that bad weather has hurt the world\u2019s largest economy. Firms reported a jump in output and new orders, while job creation hit an 11-month high. Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit, says it\u2019s \u201cone of the largest monthly improvements in manufacturing for almost four years\u201d. It appears that firms caught up with orders that were lost when the polar vortex inflicted icy weather on the US. Encouraging, but also a reminder that the Ukraine crisis comes as the global economic recovery remains fragile. David Thebault, head of quantitative sales trading at Global Equities in Paris, reports that many investors had failed to predict Russia\u2019s military incursion into Crimea. Thus this morning\u2019s selloff: \u201cInvestors had underestimated the risks of an escalation in Ukraine, so the events over the weekend are a wake-up call for the market.\u201d More than \u00a334bn has been wiped off the value of the companies listed on Russia\u2019s MICEX index today (which is currently down 12%) Via Reuters: On Monday afternoon, MICEX capitalisation stood at 18.4 trillion roubles [$512.03bn or \u00a3301bn], down from 20.5 trillion on Friday, the press service said in a statement. Good morning America: Breaking away from Ukraine again,the latest Forbes rich list is out -- and Bill Gates has reclaimed the title of the world\u2019s richest person. Gates ($76bn) swept Mexico\u2019s telecoms magnate Carlos Slim ($72bn)aside after seeing his fortune rise by $9bn in 2013, Forbes reports. Amancio Ortega ($64bn), who controls the firm behind Spain\u2019s Zara fashion chain, is third followed by everyone\u2019s favourite cherry coke-swilling value investor, Warren Buffett ($58bn). The report also shows an increase in the number of women billionaires overall, up to172 out of 1,645 in total. Mark Zuckerberg saw the biggest increase in wealth, with his fortune jumping by $15.2bn to $28.5bn as Facebook shares soared last year. Joshua Raynond of City Index says there are four key reasons for shareholders to be very concerned about the situation: 1. The potential of the situation to deepen and intensify remains large. Russia has been known to be unpredictable in the past and its aggressive and quick action in the region, along with parliamentary backing for further troop deployment not just in Crimea but the Ukraine as well, shows that it remains steadfast to increase its presence in the region. Russia has historically shown that it will protect its assets and people without hesitation. This is exactly what it is doing. 2. The reaction of the G7 is crucial. Do they call Russia\u2019s bluff? Even if Ukraine strikes at Russian troops in the Crimea region, it will still be the response of the G7 that holds the key for complete market volatility and fear. It\u2019s hard to see at this stage, with Russia holding all the cards, for the west to dramatically do anything other than appease Russian aggression. 3. A quick look at oil prices shows the impact this situation could have. Nymex front month oil futures prices hit their highest level since September last year, hitting $104 a barrel. Further oil price rises will have a knock-on effect on stocks and sectors that rely on a stable oil price to keep fundamental costs down. Rising oil prices is a direct threat to the ability of stocks to rally in the near term. This needs to be watched. 4. Key indices have also hit major resistance levels The crisis could give investors the excuse they need for a 5%-10% market correction. Market corrections are healthy for the long term bullishness of major indices and as such, should not be feared. However, with the FTSE 100, DAX and Dow Jones all recently hitting levels which triggered selling, a small price correction could now be due. So if anything, the timing of the Ukraine crisis may have well triggered the inevitable. Stephanie Flanders, JP Morgan\u2019s chief market strategist for UK and Europe (and former BBC economics editor) suggests today\u2019s heavy selloff in Russian stocks has created some real bargains for investors: \u201cEvents in Ukraine have clearly pushed investors into \u201crisk-off\u201d mode, especially when it comes to emerging market assets. Aside from this short-term volatility, we would still say the direct economic and financial fallout from Ukraine itself was fairly limited - though markets are perhaps not focused enough on the broader contagion that could follow a messy Ukrainian sovereign default. However, Russia\u2019s involvement clearly magnifies the scope for contagion and increases the possibility that global energy prices will be affected both directly and indirectly, because of Russia\u2019s previous negotiating role in the Middle East. We have been saying for some time that emerging market assets look cheap, and Russia\u2019s looked cheaper than most. At these prices, you don\u2019t have to take a very optimistic view of Russia\u2019s future to see some potential bargains.\u201d To recap: Russia\u2019s military invasion of Crimea over the weekend has hit stock markets hard today, with shares falling across the board as Europe faces its biggest crisis in years. The MICEX Russian index has now tumbled almost 12% as investors brace for the possibility of economic sanctions against Moscow. There was a wave of selling, as traders took their first opportunity to react to the arrival of thousands of Russian troops in Ukraine. Russia\u2019s central bank conducted an emergency interest rate rise, in an attempt to prop up its currency and maintain financial stability. It also spent an estimated $10bn intervening in the foreign exchange markets. But the ruble still fell another 2% to fresh record lows against the US dollar and euro. Analysts warned that the Russian financial system will come under growing pressure unless the crisis eases, and could suffer wide-spread capital flight. Ukraine\u2019s currency, the hryvnia, also hit a record low..... ...and the cost of insuring Russian government bonds has risen to a nine-month high. Wheat prices have risen by 3%, on fears of supply disruption from Ukraine. The oil prices jumped, with Brent crude gaining $3 per barrel to $112. And gold has risen $20 per ounce, to $1,345. In Europe, the FTSE 100 index of leading blue-chip shares has fallen by 135 points, or 2%. Germany\u2019s DAX has lost 2.9% over in Frankfurt as investors watched events nervously. Every main index is down. The prospect of sanctions being imposed on Russia looms over the world economy, with Carl B. Weinberg of High Frequency Economics cautioning that: Economic war with Russia, if this escalates, would take a toll on the global economy. CMC Markets Toby Morris added: For anyone who keeps their eye on the news over the weekend it\u2019s little surprise that the markets are totally dominated by events in Russia and Ukraine this morning, with European benchmarks sinking on the open as tensions threaten to derail February\u2019s recovery. In other news, France\u2019s manufacturing sector moved closer to stabilisation, according to Markit\u2019s monthly PMI survey. And UK factories added staff at the fastest rate in almost three years. REMINDER: our full liveblog on the political and military situation in Ukraine is here. French banks are being hit hard by the selloff, with Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale tumbling more than 6.5% and BNP Paribas down 3.5%. Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale is the foreign bank with the largest branch network in Russia, Bloomberg flags up. The selloff is deepening in London as noon approaches, with the FTSE 100 now down 128 points or almost 2%. Germany\u2019s DAX has slumped 2.7% in the face of the Ukraine crisis, following the news that Angela Merkel concluded Vladimir Putin had \u2018lost the plot\u2019 after speaking to the Russian leader last night. Cruise operator Carnival is one of the biggest fallers, down 4%, reflecting fears for the global economy. Advertising giant WPP is also down 4% - last week, it warned that emerging market volatility was hitting its profit margins. Wheat futures prices have jumped this morning, on fears of supply disruption from Ukraine - which is the world\u2019s fifth-biggest supplier. The cost of a tonne of wheat for delivery in May has risen over 3% this morning, to \u20ac202.75 per tonne, the highest price this year. Luke Mathews, analyst at Commonwealth Bank of Australia, told clients this morning that: \u201cThe importance of the Black Sea region to global grain markets should not be understated.\u201d The WSJ has a good take on the wheat situation, pointing out that wheat farmers are holding onto their crop while the Ukranian hryvnia continues to slump in value (hitting new low this morning) Reuters has fresh details of the Russian central bank\u2019s efforts to prop up its currency: With the FTSE 100 down 94 points, David Madden of IG sums up the mood in the City: Stocks are in the red as Russia sends troops into Ukraine. The move by Moscow has been criticised by the west and world leaders are trying to prevent an all-out war. Traders have abandoned equities and fled to safe havens like gold. Oil and gas prices have also surged, as over two thirds of Russian gas that is exported to the EU is piped through Ukraine and if tensions escalate gas supplies to the west could be cut. British banks have been hit by concerns over exposure to Russian and Ukrainian banks; with the credit lines in eastern Europe drying up, the banking system in western Europe is feeling the pinch. Europe\u2019s stock markets are a classic \u2018sea of red\u2019: In Moscow, the ruble\u2019s tumble to record lows against the US dollar and euro is clearly on display: Britain\u2019s factory sector also posted another healthy rise in output last month. Markit reported that the UK manufacturing PMI rose 56.9, from 56.6 in January, showing faster growth. The subindex which measures job creation hit its fastest rate in almost three years. Away from the Ukraine crisis, there are signs this morning that France\u2019s manufacturing decline may be halting. The monthly survey of purchasing managers conducted by Markit showed that French factories reported only a small drop in activity in February. That pulled France\u2019s PMI up to 49.7, close to the 50-point mark that separates expansion from contraction. The overall eurozone PMI fell slightly, to 53.2, from 54.0 in January -- which is still the eighth monthly expansion in a row. \uf0a7Chris Williamson, Chief Economist at Markit said: \u201cThe dip in the manufacturing PMI, its first fall for five months, is a disappointment and a reminder of the hesitant nature of the region\u2019s nascent recovery. However, we should not lose sight of the fact that this is the second-strongest reading that the eurozone has seen for almost three years. Firms also reported a rise in new orders, and a backlog of new work, while employment levels also rose for the second month running. Here\u2019s the key charts: As well as hiking rates, the Bank of Russia also appears to have spent several billion dollars to prevent the ruble falling even further: The US stock market is expected to join the selloff when New York traders reach their desks in a few hours time (Wall Street opens at 2.30pm GMT or 9.30am local time): Marketwatch has the details: Futures for the S&amp;P 500 index -0.85% fell 13.9 points, or nearly 0.8%, to 1,843.70, while those for the Dow Jones Industrial Average -0.70% tumbled 102 points, or 0.6%, to 16,205. Futures for the Nasdaq-100 index -0.89% dropped 27.75 points, or 0.8%, to 3,667.50. After the initial sharp selloff, the FTSE 100 has settled around 1.1% lower at 6730 \u2013 its lowest level in two weeks \u2013 as the situation in Ukraine hits markets worldwide . It\u2019s a fairly broad-selloff in London, with financial firms, some miners and energy providers, and even travel firms all hit by fears that global economic growth will be shunted by the unfolding crisis. Other European markets are also siding, with Germany\u2019s DAX down over 2%, while Russia\u2019s main indices are still down 10% as the panicky selloff in Moscow continues. The possibility of economic sanctions being imposed on Russia is pushing the oil price price up, with Brent crude currently up almost $2 per barrel at $110.8. As Associated Press puts it: Traders were jittery over warnings by Washington and other governments that Moscow, an oil exporter, might face sanctions after it seized control of Ukraine\u2019s Crimean Peninsula. \u201cEconomic war with Russia, if this escalates, would take a toll on the global economy,\u201d said Carl B. Weinberg of High Frequency Economics in a report. Gold producer Randgold is one of the few companies to rise in Europe today, up 4.1% as nervous traders push the gold price up this morning. Capital flight fears continue to pin the ruble at record lows against the US dollar (see analyst comments here), while Russian and Ukrainian government debt is also weakening. Ukraine\u2019s currency has also weakened this morning to a new record low, Reuters flashes up: 9.36am: UKRAINE HRYVNIA FALLS TO 11.6510 TO THE U.S. DOLLAR VS 10.8510 HRYVNIA AT FRIDAY\u2019S CLOSE This may be one reason why: The ruble has fallen against every other major currency -- particularly against the yen, as traders seek a haven for their money. Russia faces the risk of an exodus of capital as the crisis continues despite its central bank emergency rate rise this morning, analysts warn. Kit Juckes of Societe Generale predicts further \u201crisk aversion\u201d as the West seeks a diplomatic solution, writing: The ruble, the Hungarian forint and the Turkish lira will remain vulnerable to contagion in the region and wider-scale capital flight from Russia must be a risk. Russia is unlikely to back down in its support of the regional government in Crimea. The importance of Ukraine as a link in Europe\u2019s energy supply line and as the point where Russia and the European Union meet, makes the idea that either side just backs down hard to imagine, but equally, provides plenty of incentives to work towards a diplomatic solution. So this will take time. Danske Bank chief analyst Lars Christensen agrees, tweeting: My colleague Haroon Siddique is live-blogging the Ukraine crisis in detail again this morning, here: Ukraine crisis: \u2018Russia in control of Crimea\u2019 - live updates Russia has \u2018complete operational control\u2019 - US official \u2018Russian armoured vehicles lining up across border\u2019 Lavrov says China\u2019s views coincide with Russia\u2019s The cost of insuring Russia\u2019s government debt against default has jumped to a nine-month high following Putin\u2019s incursion into Crimea, and Russian bonds have also dropped in value. Five-year Russian credit default swaps are changing hands at 225 basis points, up from 192 last night. That means it would cost $225,000 per year to insure $10m of five-year debt. The Russian ruble is trading at new alltime lows this morning, despite its central bank\u2019s emergency interest rate cut this morning. It is trading at 36.44 to the US dollar, breaking through the previous low set in 2008. The ruble also hit its weakest level ever against the euro, at 50.03. There\u2019s no respite on the Moscow stock market, where around 10% has been wiped off the country\u2019s biggest listed companies. Shares in Gazprom have tumbled 12%, on fears that gas supplies could be hit by the crisis. While shares slide, the gold price has risen more than $20 per ounce to $1,347/oz on the back of the escalating geopolitical tension over Ukraine. Some news flashes from British foreign secretary William Hague, agreeing with the US that Crimea is now under the operational control of Russia: BRITISH FOREIGN MINISTER HAGUE SAYS RUSSIA HAS TAKEN OPERATIONAL CONTROL OF UKRAINE\u2019S CRIMEA BRITISH FOREIGN MINISTER HAGUE SAYS VERY CONCERNED ABOUT POSSIBILITY OF ANY FURTHER MOVES BY RUSSIA INTO EASTERN UKRAINE BRITISH FOREIGN MINISTER HAGUE SAYS RUSSIA\u2019S INTERVENTION IN UKRAINE HAS CREATED A VERY TENSE AND DANGEROUS SITUATION BRITISH FOREIGN MINISTER HAGUE SAYS RUSSIA IS ENTITLED TO HAVE TROOPS AND NAVAL FORCES AT ITS BASES THE CRIMEA BUT NEEDS TO RETURN THEM TO THE BASES This morning\u2019s selloff comes after the US conceded that Russia now has control of Crimea. Here\u2019s our latest news story from our Guardian US offices: Senior US officials dismissed claims that Washington is incapable of exerting influence on the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, but were forced to admit that Crimea had been successfully invaded by 6,000 airborne and ground troops in what could be the start of a wider invasion. \u201cThey are flying in reinforcements and they are settling in,\u201d one senior official said. Another senior official said: \u201cRussian forces now have complete operational control of the Crimean peninsula.\u201d On Monday, the Russian foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, said he had discussed Ukraine with his Chinese counterpart and their views coincided on the situation there. Lavrov said in a statement that the two veto-wielding UN security council members would stay in close contact on the issue. Meanwhile, Ukrainian border guards reported a buildup of armoured vehicles near a ferry port on the Russian side of the Kerch Channel \u2013 a narrow sea channel dividing Russia and the Ukraine. Here\u2019s the full story: US concedes Russia has control of Crimea and seeks to contain Putin Other European markets followed the FTSE 100 deep in the red. The German DAX fell 1.8% at the open, Spain\u2019s IBEX fell 1.9%, and the FTSE MIB is down 2.3%. Marc Ostwald of Monument Securities reckons the mood in the markets is \u201cfragile, febrile and fluid\u201d. The FTSE 100 index of blue chip shares has fallen by 108 point in early trading, down 1.6% at 6700. Mining stocks are leading the fallers, as investors react to the escalating crisis in Ukraine. Ian Williams, City analyst at Peel Hunt, explains: The rapid escalation of the crisis in Ukraine over the weekend is now having a clear impact on global investor sentiment with risk assets, including equity indices, facing a significant sell-off this morning. The oil price has jumped this morning, pushing up the cost of Brent crude by over $2 per barrel to $111.32. Investors in Moscow are racing to sell shares this morning, driving the MICEX composite index down almost 9% to its lowest level since last June. \u201cThere\u2019s a sell-off of everything right now,\u201d said Artem Argetkin, trader at BCS in Moscow. \u201cBrokers, for sure, are trying close their positions at any price.\u201d (via Reuters). Some instant City reaction to Russia\u2019s emergency interest rate hike this morning: Good morning. Financial markets are gripped by the unfolding crisis in the Ukraine today, as Vladimir Putin\u2019s decision to send troops into Crimea over the weekend raises fears of a new Cold War. The Russian stock market slumped when trading began, with the main MICEX index tumbling as much as 9% on the prospect of tough economic sanctions being imposed on Moscow. European markets are expected to fall around 1% when trading begins at 8am, and the price of both oil and gold is rising. Russia\u2019s central bank has announced an emergency interest rate hike this morning, raising its key borrowing rate from 5.5% to 7% after seeing the ruble crash to new record lows against the euro and dollar. In a brief statement, The Bank of Russia explained: The decision is aimed at preventing the emergence of risks to inflation and financial stability associated with the recently observed increased levels of volatility in the financial markets. The prospect of Russia being thrust into economic isolation rose further overnight, as the G7 major industrialised nations condemned Moscow\u2019s military build-up in Ukraine. Preparation for the G8 summit in Sochi in June have also been suspended. Chris Weston, IG\u2019s man in Melbourne, comments: The situation in the Ukraine is evolving seemingly by the hour and is at critical juncture. Ultimately the market wants to know to what extent the West will impose economic sanctions on Russia if there is bloodshed and further deterioration. From what we seeing right now, the scene has been set and the key personnel are in place; the orders just need to be given. The situation in the Ukraine is clearly the most pressing issue for markets and will trump all else this week. Money managers would have spent the weekend brushing up on their Russia/Ukraine/Crimea knowledge to impress clients, and now we are all political analysts again. I\u2019ll be tracking all the key developments in the markets, the world economy, the eurozone and business through the day.",

      "bodyText": "Oil prices surged, shares fell and the rouble sank to a record low after Russia sent troops to the Crimea and tensions between Russia and the west hit their highest since the cold war. Brent crude, the European benchmark oil price, rose by more than 2% to hit a peak of $112.39 a barrel \u2013 the highest since 30 December \u2013 on fears of a reduction in supply. The US has threatened sanctions against Russia over the Ukraine crisis. Russia is the world's second-biggest oil supplier and the biggest exporter of natural gas. Russia's central bank increased its main lending rate by 1.5 percentage points to 7% after the rouble sank to its lowest against both the dollar and the euro. The bank did not cite Ukraine as a reason but said the rise was aimed at \"risks to inflation and financial stability associated with the recently increased level of volatility in the financial market\". President Putin got approval from Russia's parliament on Saturday to send troops into Ukraine to protect Russians and its Black Sea fleet in the southern region of Crimea if the situation deteriorated. The MICEX index of Russian shares fell 11% in its biggest fall for five years. Shares in major Russian companies including Gazprom dropped more than 10%.

      "bodyText": "Christine Lagarde, the head of the International Monetary Fund, has poured cold water on claims from the Spanish government that the recession is over and the country is on the road to recovery. Speaking at the Global Forum on Spain in Bilbao she said: \"Thanks to the formidable actions over the past five years, Europe \u2013 and Spain \u2013are now turning the corner. Yet the task is far from finished. Growth remains too low and unemployment too high for us to declare victory on the crisis.\" The scars of the crisis run deep and will take years to heal, Lagarde said. \"There is no doubt that the reforms that I have outlined for Europe and for Spain will take several years of determined efforts by both government and society.\" The good news, she said, is that Spanish exports have risen faster than Germany's. Insisting that the \"strong reform momentum must be maintained\", she called for a continued shakeup of the labour market, and said reforms \"should not benefit those in work but those without it\". But she was immediately attacked for, in effect, advocating more wage cuts. Joaqu\u00edn Almunia, the European competition commissioner, who was also in Bilbao, criticised Lagarde for calling for wage cuts, which he said would be \"neither sensitive, reasonable nor fair\". \"Sacrifice has to be shared, and economists should not demand what is not viable in practice,\" he said. She pointed to three key areas that need reform. The first is the labour market, but she said the reforms \"shouldn't benefit those in work but those without it.\" The Spanish government has already made it much easier for firms to sack employees, and has pushed down wages. Last week the Bank of Spain insisted that since the crisis began wages have fallen twice as fast as the government claims they have. If the lowest paid who had lost their jobs were taken out of the equation, the wages of those still in work could be seen to have declined sharply, the bank said. Lagarde also singled out the high level of debt, calling on the government to reduce its deficit by raising VAT and income tax. Her third target was reform of the business environment, in which companies, especially new ones, are hamstrung by a labyrinthine bureaucracy. \"Making it easier for businesses to start up and grow will lift their capacity to create employment,\" she said. \"Making domestic firms more competitive will also boost their employment and productivity.\" Luis De Guindos, the Spanish finance minister, insisted that \"unlike 2011, this is not a false recovery\". However, he said it remained \"tenuous and soft\". Meanwhile, groups of hooded demonstrators protesting at the summit chanted \"Troika, go home!\" and rioted in central Bilbao, smashing the windows of banks and setting fire to rubbish containers.",

      "bodyText": "Harris + Hoole, the coffee shop chain that is designed to look and feel artisan and independent but is half-owned by Tesco, is planning to double in size to up to 60 stores employing more than 1,000 people. The chain, which has attracted criticism for presenting its shops as family-owned and independent when it is 49% owned by the UK's biggest supermarket chain, said it hopes to hire an additional 500 people this year as it embarks on a major expansion in the south-east. The company, named after coffee-loving characters in the Diary of Samuel Pepys, already employs 550 people. A spokeswoman for the chain, which has expanded to 30 shops in the 18 months since the first opened in Buckinghamshire, refused to state exactly how many new stores are planned. \"Harris + Hoole takes an opportunistic approach to expansion \u2013 when we see a site where we feel we can provide a really high-quality offer we will go for it,\" she said. The spokeswoman said most of the new stores will be the south-east of England and would be split between standalone high street branches and concessions inside Tesco stores. She said a doubling of staff might not necessarily imply a doubling of stores because the company is also hiring staff for \"kitchen hubs\" to make food that will no longer be made in the individual coffee shops. Harris + Hoole is a key plank of Tesco's attempt to reinvent itself as a shopping destination and not just a supermarket. However, Harris + Hoole does not make any attempt to inform customers in its standalone coffee shops that the chain is part-owned by Tesco. There is no mention of Tesco's ownership stake on Harris + Hoole's menus or in the stores. \"We don't believe our customers are interested in who is providing the financial backing for our business. They come to our shops to enjoy better coffee in a great environment, but of course if anyone is interested in our business backers, we'll always happily answer their questions,\" the spokeswoman said. On its website, it states: \"Harris + Hoole is a family affair\" and shows snapshots of Australian siblings Nick, Andrew and Laura Tolley, who own the majority stake and founded the existing Taylor Street coffee chain in London. Harris + Hoole is also planning to expand its stores into nightspot destinations and has received alcohol licences for stores in Sunbury, Walton-on-Thames and North Finchley. The company was blocked from receiving a license in Richmond after residents campaigned against the plans.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "From the Facebook executive who told women to \"lean in\" to get ahead at work, to a Nigerian oil tycoon and a British online gambling entrepreneur, a record number of women have entered the global club of billionaires. A total of 172 women, up 25% on 2013, have made Forbes' 28th annual billionaires' list. Women now make up 10% of the global super-rich. Facebook chief operating officer Sheryl Sandberg, with a personal fortune worth more than $1bn (\u00a3600m), becomes one of the highest-profile new entrants to the Forbes list, joining Meg Whitman of Hewlett-Packard as the only other female tech billionaire. Nigeria's first female billionaire, businesswoman Folorunsho Alakija, is also making her Forbes debut. Born into a wealthy family, she studied fashion in London before going into the oil business in 1993. Her stake in Famfa Oil provides the bulk of her $2.5bn fortune. According to Forbes, a record number of 42 women broke into the list for the first time, although only 32 female billionaires (1.9% of the total) built their own fortune, rather than inheriting it from a parent or husband. The world's richest woman is Christy Walton, who shares a $36.7bn chunk of the Walmart fortune, edging out one of L'Or\u00e9al's principal shareholders, Liliane Bettencourt. One of the top UK entrants is Denise Coates, the British online gambling queen who, along with her brother, owns Bet365. Coates was at school when she started working as a cashier in her father's betting shops and has amassed $1.6bn in personal wealth. Fiercely private, she has escaped almost all press attention in the UK despite Bet365 taking almost \u00a320bn in bets and making \u00a3150m in profits in the year to March 2013. In a rare interview two years ago, Coates told the Guardian how she has, on occasion, had to correct some people who had assumed that her father, a well-known businessman, ran the company. Her business, which employs 2,500 workers, mostly in Stoke-on-Trent, made a \u00a3150m profit last year, even after swallowing \u00a331m of losses from Bet365's controlling interest in Stoke City football club Coates, who owns half the business, received pay and bonuses of \u00a35.4m, as well as her share of \u00a315m in dividends. Even after these payouts the company had a further \u00a3430m in cash reserves on the balance sheet. In the past five years, Bet365 has paid out dividends totalling \u00a3130m. A total of nine women feature in the top 85 - two having joined since Oxfam analysis in January showed that the world's richest 85 people have $1 trillion - as much as the poorest half of the world's 7 billion population. Bill Gates reclaimed his crown as the world's richest man, after a surge in the value of Microsoft shares increased his wealth by $9bn to $76bn. Mexican telecoms mogul Carlos Slim, who held the title for the previous four years, was nudged into second place with a fortune of $72bn. The Spanish clothing tycoon Amancio Ortega, behind fast fashion chain Zara, stayed in third place, extending his lead over investor Warren Buffett at four. The biggest riser was Facebook's founder, Mark Zuckerberg, whose fortune almost doubled to $28.bn, as shares in the social network soared. He is joined by other tech wizards, with Dropbox chief executive, Drew Houston, and WhatsApp founders, Jan Koum and Brian Acton, making the list for the first time. The last-minute entry for Koum and Acton comes after Facebook announced it would pay $19bn for the messaging app - a sweet deal for Acton, who was rejected for a job with Facebook in 2009. The richest Briton remains the Duke of Westminster, whose Grosvenor property company owns a swathe of Belgravia and Knightsbridge, as well as tens of thousands of acres in Cambridge, Liverpool and Scotland. London's surging property market also boosted the fortunes of the billionaire Reuben brothers \u2013 the second richest Britons \u2013 and the fourth richest, Charles Cadogan, a former banker who inherited his family's centuries-old holdings in Knightsbridge and Chelsea. Shopping was one of the other mainsprings of UK wealth: Mike Ashley, the reclusive founder of Sports Direct, is Britain's fifth richest person, with clothing tycoon Sir Philip Green and his wife Cristina, not far behind in seventh. The US has by far the largest number of billionaires, with China in second place with a record 152, up from 122 last year. China's richest man Wang Jianlin, who grew up in poverty during the Cultural Revolution to amass a fortune in department stores, cinemas and five-star hotels, is now extending his interests in the UK with the recent acquisition of luxury Sunseeker yachts. But other emerging economies, buffeted by turbulence on currency markets, saw their super-wealthy fall out of the Forbes list. Turkey lost 19 billionaires to inflation and the falling value of its stock market, while Indonesia saw eight of its wealthy drop out of the list, after its currency plummeted 20% against the dollar. But 2013 will be remembered as a good year for the world's super-rich, who now have collective wealth of $6.4tn, up from $5.4 tn the previous year.",

      "bodyText": "Tony Abbott has paved the way for a dramatic political standoff over the future of Qantas with a decision to remove all requirements for the national carrier to be located in Australia, be majority-owned and run by Australians or to employ Australians. After what the prime minister described as a \u201cstrong and spirited\u201d two-hour cabinet discussion, he announced the government would introduce amendments as soon as Thursday to remove restrictions on Qantas from the Qantas Sale Act, and that the loan guarantee sought by Qantas \u2013 and until just last week very favourably discussed by government ministers \u2013 would not be forthcoming. \u201cThis decision says something significant about this government. We do not believe in government by chequebook \u2026 We don\u2019t believe in any normal circumstances that government should be playing favourites between private businesses,\u201d Abbott said, insisting Virgin was every bit as Australian as Qantas because it also employed Australian people. Section three of the Qantas Sale Act, which the government will seek to remove in its entirety: \u2022 Restricts total foreign ownership of Qantas to 49%, as well as capping the level of ownership by another single foreign airline at 35% and a single foreign owner at 25%. \u2022 Requires the Qantas head office to be in Australia. \u2022 Requires two-thirds of Qantas directors be Australian citizens. \u2022 Requires Qantas to be incorporated in Australia. \u2022 Requires that maintenance and catering for international flights be primarily done in Australia. \u2022 Stops Qantas from changing its name. The decision sets the scene for a bitter parliamentary showdown, with Labor and the Greens insisting that the national carrier must be majority Australian-owned. The changes are also opposed by Clive Palmer, whose senators will have balance of power votes in the new Senate that sits from July. Qantas has pleaded with the government not to try to force through major changes to the Qantas Sale Act because it would embroil the future of the airline in politics. But Abbott said that if Qantas suffered it would be Labor\u2019s fault. Asked whether he would negotiate to get the changes through Abbott said: \u201cI don\u2019t believe that even the Labor party is going to stand aside and let Qantas bleed.\u201d And he was unapologetic about the possibility of some Qantas jobs going offshore. \u201cIt is deeply regrettable whenever an a job goes offshore \u2026 but the best way to maximise good jobs in this country is to maximise the competitiveness of our businesses. Now if some jobs have to go offshore in order to ensure Qantas has a strong and viable long-term future it may be regrettable, but nevertheless it is the best way to guarantee Australian jobs for the long term.\u201d Abbott said how Qantas responded to the changes would be a matter for management. The amendments would leave the carrier with little option but to follow rival Virgin\u2019s example and split its operations into a domestic business which could attract foreign owners and an international business that would have to remain majority Australian-owned in order to benefit from government-negotiated international landing rights. Qantas is deeply concerned the decision leaves it in the middle of a political fight, but without any short-term solution to what it says is an \u201cunlevel playing field\u201d due to Virgin\u2019s ability to attract foreign capital. \u201cFrom our point of view the urgent and immediate matters at hand will not be fixed by changes to the Qantas Sale Act,\u201d its chief executive, Alan Joyce, has said. The Labor leader, Bill Shorten, said he would fight to keep Qantas Australian and to save Australian jobs but \u201cunder Tony Abbott, Qantas will be Australian no more\u201d. The Labor transport spokesman, Anthony Albanese, said the Coalition was putting \u201cdogma ahead of Australian jobs\u201d. The Greens also reaffirmed they would not support any changes to the Qantas Sale Act. The Greens\u2019 deputy leader, Adam Bandt, said he urged Labor not to \u201cwork with Tony Abbott to change the legislation to enable jobs to go offshore\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s disappointing that Joe Hockey got rolled in cabinet because Tony Abbott is out to kill Qantas as the national carrier,\u201d Bandt said. Until just two weeks ago the treasurer, Hockey, was strongly suggesting the government would offer Qantas a debt guarantee.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "George Osborne must do more to boost business investment and trade and make good on promises to rebalance the UK economy, the CBI has said in advance of the chancellor's budget this month. The business lobby group has said the economy remains too dependent on consumer demand and has outlined a series of demands for Osborne when he presents his budget on 19 March. It wants help for businesses struggling with energy costs, more investment incentives for small firms, and a freeze on air passenger duty. \"The economic recovery is taking hold, with businesses and consumers both feeling more confident, but we must make sure that it really takes root and this can only be done through rebalancing,\" said John Cridland, CBI director-general. \"There are encouraging signs that business investment and net trade are on the up and now is the perfect time for the government to get full square behind it, particularly in the case of smaller firms. Above all, British businesses must have secure and affordable energy that enables them to compete internationally and keep jobs in the UK.\" His comments echoed calls from the manufacturers' organisation EEF, submitted to the government last week, for help on energy costs. Arguing that the cost of energy has become the most uncompetitive aspect of the UK business environment, EEF urged the chancellor to freeze and then reduce the cost of the carbon price floor, a tax on greenhouse gas pollution. The CBI also called for a freeze on the carbon price floor and reports have suggested the government will grant its wish after pressure from many business groups. Following warnings from economists that business investment needs to pick up to put the UK recovery on a sustainable path, the CBI also called for support for smaller businesses looking to spend. It wants the government to extend its \u00a3250,000 investment allowance tax break beyond its current deadline of January 2015 and to introduce a capital allowance for structures and buildings. The investment allowance was boosted from only \u00a325,000 to \u00a3250,000 last year. It has also argued for a freeze on UK air passenger duty (APD), which it said was the highest in the EU, and wants a review of the APD system, especially for long-haul flights. \"To successfully rebalance our economy we need to give businesses a leg-up to invest in new equipment and to sell more of their goods and services around the world,\" said Cridland. The group also commented on Britain's housing crisis. The CBI wants the government to hold local authorities accountable for setting aside five years' land supply for housebuilders, and said all public-sector property holdings should be listed on a central website. \"We simply aren't building enough affordable housing in the UK \u2013 the government must make a concerted effort to boost supply, particularly for the private rental sector,\" said Cridland. The latest data on housebuilding showed the number of homes completed in England last year fell by 5% to 109,370, less than half of the estimated 250,000 new homes a year needed to keep pace with the formation of new households. Finally, the CBI called on Osborne to make his budget fiscally neutral. \"With the deficit reduction less than half complete, the CBI wants this package of measures to be implemented in a fiscally neutral way. It should be paid for by efficiency savings gained through public services reform,\" the group said.",

      "body": "<p>George Osborne must do more to boost business investment and trade and make good on promises to rebalance the UK economy, the CBI has said in advance of the chancellor's budget this month.</p> <p>The business lobby group has said the economy remains too dependent on consumer demand and has outlined a series of demands for Osborne when he presents his budget on 19 March. It wants help for businesses struggling with energy costs, more investment incentives for small firms, and a freeze on air passenger duty.</p> <p>\"The economic recovery is taking hold, with businesses and consumers both feeling more confident, but we must make sure that it really takes root and this can only be done through rebalancing,\" said John Cridland, CBI director-general. \"There are encouraging signs that business investment and net trade are on the up and now is the perfect time for the government to get full square behind it, particularly in the case of smaller firms. Above all, British businesses must have secure and affordable energy that enables them to compete internationally and keep jobs in the UK.\"</p> <p>His comments echoed <a href=\"http://www.eef.org.uk/releases/uk/2014/Budget-must-fire-starting-gun-on-plan-to-tackle-escalating-industrial-energy-costs.htm\" title=\"\">calls from the manufacturers' organisation EEF</a>, submitted to the government last week, for help on energy costs. Arguing that the cost of energy has become the most uncompetitive aspect of the UK business environment, EEF urged the chancellor to freeze and then reduce the cost of the carbon price floor, a tax on greenhouse gas pollution.</p> <p>The CBI also called for a freeze on the carbon price floor and reports have suggested the government will grant its wish after pressure from many business groups.</p> <p>Following warnings from economists that business investment needs to pick up to put the UK recovery on a sustainable path, the CBI also called for support for smaller businesses looking to spend. It wants the government to extend its \u00a3250,000 investment allowance tax break beyond its current deadline of January 2015 and to introduce a capital allowance for structures and buildings. The investment allowance was boosted from only \u00a325,000 to \u00a3250,000 last year.</p> <p>It has also argued for a freeze on UK air passenger duty (APD), which it said was the highest in the EU, and wants a review of the APD system, especially for long-haul flights. \"To successfully rebalance our economy we need to give businesses a leg-up to invest in new equipment and to sell more of their goods and services around the world,\" said Cridland.</p> <p>The group also commented on Britain's housing crisis. The CBI wants the government to hold local authorities accountable for setting aside five years' land supply for housebuilders, and said all public-sector property holdings should be listed on a central website. \"We simply aren't building enough affordable housing in the UK \u2013 the government must make a concerted effort to boost supply, particularly for the private rental sector,\" said Cridland.</p> <p>The latest data on housebuilding showed the number of homes completed in England last year fell by 5% to 109,370, less than half of the estimated 250,000 new homes a year needed to keep pace with the formation of new households.</p> <p>Finally, the CBI called on Osborne to make his budget fiscally neutral.</p> <p>\"With the deficit reduction less than half complete, the CBI wants this package of measures to be implemented in a fiscally neutral way. It should be paid for by efficiency savings gained through public services reform,\" the group said.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The surging housing market has broadened out beyond London and the south-east, with prices up in more than half the country for the first time in 10 years, according to data from property researchers Hometrack. In England and Wales, prices rose for 51% of postcodes in February, the highest proportion since July 2004, researchers said. This pushed average prices up 0.7%\u2013 the biggest monthly rise since April 2007. \"The housing recovery continues to spread across the country, building on the momentum that started a year ago,\" said Hometrack director Richard Donnell. \"This is the greatest coverage of house price growth for almost a decade showing the extent to which market sentiment has improved in the last 12 months.\" The figures showed the sharpest gains around the country were still in London, with prices up 1.1% in a month, followed by the south-east, up 0.9%. All other regions registered price gains below the England and Wales average as buyers remained cautious, it said. A separate report released on Monday pointed to the influx of first-time buyers into the market, with numbers up by a third in January compared with the same month last year. That helped push up first home purchase prices by 16% over the 12 months, significantly higher than overall house price inflation. The average first home now costs just under \u00a3156,000, according to data from property services company LSL \u2013 up \u00a35,000 in a month. The reports follow figures from lender Nationwide on Friday that showed the average price of a home was 9.4% higher than a year ago, the biggest increase since the coalition came to power in 2010. The data will fan fears that parts of the housing market are overheating, fuelled by the long-standing mismatch between supply and demand and the government's much criticised Help to Buy scheme, the aim of which is at help people who cannot afford a large deposit to get a mortgage. With house prices rising and mortgage approvals up, housebuilders last week reported surging profits. But the government, including David Cameron, has dismissed concerns that Help to Buy might be feeding a housing bubble, arguing that average prices are still below their pre-crisis peak. Hometrack said the latest rises echoed a pick up in demand, with a 17% jump in new buyers registering with agents in January. The company said improving consumer confidence and low mortgage rates were driving increased demand for housing across a growing number of markets beyond the south-east. There was some pickup in the stock of housing for sale, which rose 11.2% over the month, marking the highest increase in supply for almost seven years. But the property search site Rightmove noted the supply of homes for sale was growing off a low base. With the mismatch between supply and demand keeping upward pressure on prices, the proportion of the asking price achieved by sellers continued to increase in January (95.8% across England and Wales and 98.8% in London). In the East Midlands and Wales, however, the proportion remained below 94%. The figures from LSL Property Services showed first-time buyers registered at its two estate agent chains were paying bigger deposits, with an average of \u00a327,519. But with real wages stagnating, deposits are making up a bigger proportion of buyers' incomes. The average deposit represented 75.1% of a first-time buyer's income in January. Repayments as a proportion of income were also rising, although they remained at 22.4%. \"While the property market has been firing forwards, wage growth has been stuck in the mud of the economic recovery,\" said David Newnes, director of estate agents Your Move and Reeds Rains, part of LSL. But he said the rising pressure was not blocking new buyers from the property market because of higher loan-to-value (LTV) lending.",
