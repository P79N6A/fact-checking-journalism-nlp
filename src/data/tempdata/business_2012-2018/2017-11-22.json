      "bodyText": "Britain\u2019s growth prospects are far weaker than previously thought, according to the Office for Budget Responsibility, as stalling productivity and cash-strapped consumers provide a bleak backdrop for the economy. The government\u2019s independent economic forecaster sharply downgraded its growth predictions and now expects the economy to grow by just 1.5% this year, after predicting 2% growth back in March at the time of the last budget. Growth then slows to 1.4% next year and 1.3% in 2019, which would be the weakest rate since 2009, when the UK economy was in the depths of the financial crisis. Robert Chote, chairman of the OBR, said the bleaker outlook for growth reflected poor productivity \u2013 the amount of output generated per hour worked \u2013 in Britain and the additional strain placed on households by the sharp fall in the value of the pound since the Brexit vote. A weaker pound has driven up the cost of goods imported from abroad and fed through to higher inflation, which is expected to peak at 3% by the end of 2017. \u201cThe UK economy has slowed this year as households\u2019 real incomes and spending have been squeezed by higher inflation. The persistence of weak productivity growth does not bode well for the UK\u2019s growth potential in the years ahead,\u201d the OBR said, in a gloomy assessment of Britain\u2019s economic prospects. \u201cWe have lowered our real GDP forecast in every year.\u201d The OBR\u2019s view of GDP growth is now more pessimistic than that of the Bank of England, which is predicting increases of 1.6%, 1.6% and 1.7% over the next three years compared with the OBR\u2019s 1.5%, 1.4% and 1.3% over the same period. Brexit-related uncertainty is affecting firms\u2019 appetite for investing in new machinery, technology and people, with dire consequences for productivity, according to the OBR, because such advances would allow businesses to produce more in less time. It conceded it had been too optimistic about the prospect of a pick-up in productivity, which has stalled since the financial crisis. The productivity slowdown has limited growth, weighed on living standards and put the UK behind most of its peers in the G7 group of leading industrial nations. In its latest assessment for the health of the economy, the OBR finally abandoned its previously consistent view that productivity growth would return to its pre-crisis trend of about 2% a year. It now expects productivity growth of just 0.9% this year, rising to 1.2% in 2022, with a knock-on effect on overall economic growth. The Resolution Foundation thinktank said family finances would be hard hit by weaker productivity. \u201cThat downgrade has huge implications for family finances over the remainder of the parliament. Disposable incomes are now expected to be \u00a3540 lower by 2023 than forecast in March,\u201d the thinktank said. \u201cPay is not set to return to its 2008 peak until the middle of the next decade, with Britain now facing a 17-year pay downturn.\u201d The weaker outlook for growth is expected to place greater strain on the public finances over the coming years, with borrowing expected to be cumulatively \u00a329bn higher by 2021-22 than the OBR predicted in March. However, the higher borrowing total also reflects the chancellor\u2019s decision to ease the pace of austerity \u2013 by spending more on a number of budget giveaways \u2013 as well as weaker growth. \u201cThe chancellor has been bolder than widely expected and has bowed to pressure to ease the near-term pace of the fiscal consolidation,\u201d said Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at consultancy Pantheon Macroeconomics. Despite raising its forecasts for total borrowing over the five-year forecast horizon, the OBR revised down its prediction for 2017-18 to \u00a349.9bn from \u00a358.3bn in March. \u201cPublic sector borrowing is lower today than we expected in March, but the revisions to our economy forecast weaken the outlook for tax receipts and put upward pressure on borrowing in future years,\u201d Chote said. \u201cOn top of the forecast changes, the government has announced a fiscal giveaway that adds to borrowing in all but the last year of the forecast.\u201d Chote said the government was unlikely to run a surplus \u2013 where government income exceeds expenditure \u2013 until 2031, meaning the government would miss its target of eliminating the deficit \u2013 where expenditure exceeds income \u2013 by 2025. Suren Thiru, head of economics at the British Chambers of Commerce, said the outlook for the public finances could be worse than the OBR suggests. \u201cIt is encouraging that government borrowing for this financial year is now expected to be lower than in their previous forecast. However, over the next few years, the pressure on the UK\u2019s fiscal position is likely to increase by more than the OBR is currently predicting, in the face of subdued growth and weak productivity.\u201d The OBR\u2019s new forecasts suggest that net debt as share of GDP is expected to fall to 86.4% in 2018-19 from 86.5% in the current year, allowing the chancellor to meet one of his fiscal targets.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The 1956 Suez crisis was the moment Britain had to wake up to the fact that it was no longer the force it once was. The November 2017 budget was its economic equivalent. Forget the extra money to paper over the cracks in the NHS. Leave to one side the willingness to throw money at sorting out universal credit. The real story was not the latest attempt to boost home ownership but the news from the Office for Budget Responsibility on the state of the economy. This was little short of calamitous. For the past 100 years and more the UK has gradually got a bit better at doing things. New machines have been introduced. Workers have become more skilled. More has been produced with less effort and as a result living standards have risen steadily. Until the financial crisis, this improvement in productivity averaged 2% a year, with periods of stronger growth in the 1950s and 1960s balancing out the bad times, such as the 1920s and early 1930s. The OBR, the government\u2019s independent forecasting body, says this long-term trend has been broken. Britain can no longer expect productivity growth of around 2% a year; instead it will have to make do with around 1% a year. Before the financial crisis, the UK was at or near the top of the G7 league table; now it is at the bottom. Inevitable consequences flow from this. Slower growth means individuals and companies pay less tax. Unless public spending is cut, that means the government has to borrow more. It is now more than 10 years since the start of the financial crisis and the OBR\u2019s gloomy outlook marks the moment when Britain has to stop kidding itself. Growth is not going to return to its pre-crash levels. The 21% gap between output per hour now and where it would have been had it remained on its pre-2007 path is never going to be closed. Britain is substantially and permanently poorer. According to Philip Hammond, there is nothing to worry about. Britain is alive with innovation and is at the cutting edge of the coming fourth industrial revolution. Churchillian rhetoric of the \u201cblood, sweat and tears\u201d type is not really Hammond\u2019s style, even though on this occasion it would have been merited because the economy is now going to be \u00a349bn smaller at the end of the current parliament than previously envisaged. The chancellor\u2019s message, rather, was to keep calm and carry on. The best that can be said for Hammond is that he didn\u2019t make a bad situation worse. He could have responded to the OBR\u2019s gloomier forecasts by hunkering down, by imposing fresh public spending cuts or raising taxes. Instead, he has done the opposite. He has decided to increase spending and borrowing to see the economy through what is expected to be a rocky period when the UK leaves the EU in 2019. In its own modest way, the budget adhered to Keynesian principles. There will be an extra \u00a32.7bn of borrowing in 2018-19 and a rather more substantial \u00a39.2bn in 2019-20, when Britain will be leaving the EU. It certainly makes sense for the government to be leaning against the wind at a time when the private sector is inevitably going to be wary of investing, especially since the chancellor can do so by once again pushing back the date by which Britain\u2019s public finances will be back in the black. In the dim and distant days of 2010, George Osborne promised he could get on top of the UK\u2019s budget deficit in one five-year parliamentary term. That soon became two parliaments and now, it would appear, the earliest date for budget balance will be the middle of the next decade. Osborne\u2019s notion that he could cut the economy back to growth has been tested to destruction over the past seven years. Britain has ended up with slower growth, weaker productivity, stubbornly high borrowing, a doubling of debt and growth that is still over-dependent on personal debt. The good news is that Hammond has effectively called time on the age of austerity. The bad news is that his drip-feed of new money is not nearly enough to compensate for previously announced Whitehall spending cuts, the benefits freeze and the fall in real incomes caused by the cost of living running ahead of inflation. Listening to Hammond, the impression was of a real giveaway budget of the sort that Nigel Lawson delivered in 1988. He hit most of the politically sensitive targets by providing emergency help for the NHS, freezing fuel duties, addressing the universal credit debacle and abolishing stamp duty for first-time home buyers. With the exception of the stamp duty change, which will only push up house prices and place them further out of the reach of young people, there were reasons to welcome most of what Hammond announced. Business liked the help he announced on business rates and, given that the budget was all about preparing Britain for technological change, the increased generosity of the research and development tax credit made sense. But the money has been spread thin as a closer investigation of the Treasury\u2019s red book \u2013 which costs the various budget measures \u2013 makes clear. The NHS has not received as much as it needs to meet ever-increasing demand; nor was the extra investment in housing nearly as generous as it sounded. The \u00a3300m for universal credit next year is tiny when set in the context of a \u00a32tn economy. Hammond thinks his supply side measures will help to revive productivity growth. There are some analysts who think the OBR is being too negative and that there are already signs that productivity is picking up. The alternative view is that Britain has had one recession a decade since the 1970s and sooner or later will have another serious downturn. It is about to go through the Brexit process with the economy in poor shape. From that perspective, this budget needed to put Britain on a war footing in order to win what will inevitably be a long battle to raise productivity. And it didn\u2019t. \u2022Follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk, or sign up to the daily Business Today email here.",

There will be an extra \u00a32.7bn of borrowing in 2018-19 and a rather more substantial \u00a39.2bn in 2019-20, when Britain will be leaving the EU.</p> \n<p>It certainly makes sense for the government to be leaning against the wind at a time when the private sector is inevitably going to be wary of investing, especially since the chancellor can do so by once again pushing back the date by which Britain\u2019s public finances will be back in the black. In the dim and distant days of 2010, George Osborne promised he could get on top of the UK\u2019s budget deficit in one five-year parliamentary term. That soon became two parliaments and now, it would appear, the earliest date for budget balance will be the middle of the next decade. Osborne\u2019s notion that he could cut the economy back to growth has been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/economics-blog/2017/oct/22/is-the-growth-in-living-standards-worse-now-than-the-great-depression\">tested to destruction over the past seven years</a>. Britain has ended up with slower growth, weaker productivity, stubbornly high borrowing, a doubling of debt and growth that is still over-dependent on personal debt.</p> \n<p>The good news is that Hammond has effectively called time on the age of austerity. The bad news is that his drip-feed of new money is not nearly enough to compensate for previously announced Whitehall spending cuts, the benefits freeze and the fall in real incomes caused by the cost of living running ahead of inflation.</p> \n<p>Listening to Hammond, the impression was of a real giveaway budget of the sort that Nigel Lawson delivered in 1988. He hit most of the politically sensitive targets by providing <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/nov/22/budgets-16bn-cash-boost-for-nhs-less-than-half-of-experts-advice\">emergency help for the NHS</a>, freezing fuel duties, addressing the universal credit debacle and abolishing stamp duty for first-time home buyers.</p> \n<p>With the exception of the stamp duty change, which will only <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/nov/22/stamp-duty-cut-first-time-buyers-fix-housing-market-budget-2017\">push up house prices</a> and place them further out of the reach of young people, there were reasons to welcome most of what Hammond announced. Business liked the help he announced on business rates and, given that the budget was all about preparing Britain for technological change, the increased generosity of the research and development tax credit made sense.</p> \n<p>But the money has been spread thin as a closer investigation of the Treasury\u2019s red book \u2013 which costs the various budget measures \u2013 makes clear. The NHS has not received as much as it needs to meet ever-increasing demand; nor was the extra investment in housing nearly as generous as it sounded. The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/nov/22/universal-credit-wait-reduced-to-five-weeks\">\u00a3300m for universal credit next year</a> is tiny when set in the context of a \u00a32tn economy.<br></p> \n<p>Hammond thinks his supply side measures will help to revive productivity growth. There are some analysts who think the OBR is being too negative and that there are already signs that productivity is picking up.</p> \n<p>The alternative view is that Britain has had one recession a decade since the 1970s and sooner or later will have another serious downturn. It is about to go through the Brexit process with the economy in poor shape. From that perspective, this budget needed to put Britain on a war footing in order to win what will inevitably be a long battle to raise productivity. And it didn\u2019t.</p> \n<p>\u2022Follow Guardian Business on Twitter at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BusinessDesk\">@BusinessDesk</a>, or sign up to the daily Business Today email <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/info/2017/may/16/guardian-business-today-sign-up-financial-news-email?CMP=business_footnote\">here</a>.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Multiyork Furniture has called in administrators, putting more than 500 jobs at risk. The furniture maker, which employs 547 people in 50 shops and manufactures upholstered furnishings in Thetford, Norfolk, has struggled amid a tough retail market in which shoppers are shying away from spending on expensive items for their homes. Multiyork had reportedly been put on the market by its major shareholder, the furnishings tycoon Charles Wade of Wade Furniture Group, which also owns beds maker Feather &amp; Black. The two brands are run as separate entities and the administration does not include the bed maker. Administrators said that Multiyork has fallen into financial difficulties as it could not meet its financial liabilities as a result of trading losses. The company had net debt of \u00a31.9m at its 2016 year end, according to the latest accounts filed at Companies House. It recorded a profit of just \u00a3479,000 in the 53 weeks to 2 October 2016 after a \u00a3714,000 loss a year before. The company increased sales by 5.4% to \u00a350.4m, partly thanks to an extra week\u2019s trading on the year before. The brand, which was founded in 1978 and initially operated in the Old Mill site in the village of Mellis, Suffolk, was rescued from receivership by Wade in 1995. Allan Graham of Duff &amp; Phelps, who was appointed joint administrator on Tuesday, said the business would continue to run for a short period as administrators continue to look for a buyer. \u201cWe are asking interested parties to come forward as quickly as possible,\u201d he said. \u201cTrading conditions for UK retailers continue to be difficult due to a number of factors including economic uncertainty, rising commodity prices, increasing business rates and the fall in value of the pound which has increased the cost of importing raw materials and products,\u201d Graham said. \u201cThis appears to be leading to a sharp fall in consumer confidence and less money being spent on discretionary items.\u201d The collapse of Multiyork comes after B&amp;Q, John Lewis and online electrical goods specialist AO all pointed to a slowdown in major purchases for the home this week. Redecorating, renovating and DIY projects are being put on hold as household budgets come under pressure in the run-up to Christmas. Sofa specialist DFS, which also owns Sofa Workshop and Dwell, last month revealed a 22% plunge in annual profits as it said shoppers were cutting back on big-ticket purchases. But not all furnishings businesses are suffering. On Wednesday, ScS, one of the UK\u2019s largest retailers of upholstered furniture and floorings, revealed a 2.9% rise in orders at established stores in the 16 weeks to 18 November. Dunelm also flagged a sales recovery last month, easing concerns after the departure of its relatively new chief executive John Browett. Graham said that the current management of Multiyork would continue to work with administrators to review all orders placed up until 22 November with the intention that all orders would be completed. \u201cWe ask that customers who have placed orders be patient during this time and you will be contacted with further updates in relation to your order shortly,\u201d he said. \u2022Follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk, or sign up to the daily Business Today email here.",

      "bodyText": "The rather unexpected allusion by the prime minister this week in a speech to the Business Council of Australia to the government\u2019s pursuit of further income tax cuts is not one that should be treated with too much respect until he also talks about how to pay for them. With the return to surplus built on income tax revenue, any income tax cuts are unlikely to come before the next decade without either increases in other taxes or big cuts to government services. Amid the usual \u201cfree markets are great\u201d rah-rah that the prime minister doled out to the Business Council of Australia on Monday night, Malcolm Turnbull also slipped in a line on income tax cuts, noting that he was: \u201cActively working with the treasurer and all my cabinet colleagues to ease the burden on middle-income Australians, while also meeting our commitment to return the budget to surplus.\u201d This was a bit of a surprise given the current state of the budget is such that the government is projecting that a return to surplus only in 2020-21and that net debt at that point will total $366bn, or 17.6% of GDP. Even in the best of times, promising income tax cuts as the budget is in deficit is a courageous position to take for a political party that likes to prides itself on \u201cbudget responsibility\u201d.It is even more courageous when the path back to surplus is built on a foundation of income tax revenue. Individual\u2019s income tax has always been the biggest tax in the budget. During the mining-boom years it declined slightly in importance as company tax exploded in value from 3.3% of GDP in 1998-99 to5.3% of GDP in 2005-06. But in the current financial year, individual income tax accounts for just over half of all tax revenue. Now that in itself is a bit of a problem (the IMF and OECD have made calls for Australia to lessen its reliance on income tax) but it is a bigger problem for Turnbull and his call for tax cuts while also \u201cmeeting our commitment to return the budget to surplus.\u201d The issue it that of the extra $88.1bn in tax revenue the government hopes to gain between now and 2020-21, $48.5bn of it is to come from individual income tax. This means that income tax is actually bearing a greater burden of the increase in tax than would be expected. Income tax makes up 50.6% of total tax revenue, but accounts for 55% of the increase in tax revenue between now and 2020-21. By contrast, company tax currently makes up 19.2% of total tax revenue and accounts for a similar 19.5% of the expected growth in tax revenue. The GST is actually predicted to become less important over the next four years as we continue to move our spending to non-GST items and services. Now $8.5bn of that extra income tax is to come from the rise in the Medicare levy, but overall the budget predicts that the next four years will see individual income tax revenue grow by more each year than it has in all but one of the past five years. This is partly based on a hope for continuing solid employment growth and partly on increased revenue via wages growth. As I noted last week, the budget predicts that by June next year, wages will be growing annually by 2.5% \u2013 something they haven\u2019t done since June 2014. By June 2020-21 the budget further predicts they will be growing at 3.75%, which hasn\u2019t happened since June 2011. If this does not come to pass, then the income tax figures are in great danger of being below expectations. On Tuesday night the governor of the Reserve Bank, Philip Lowe, gave the audience at the Australian Business Economists Annual Dinner little reason to expect that wages growth would pick up to that extent. Rather he noted that the growth in average hourly earnings \u201cis running at the lowest rate since at least the 1960s\u201d. You can understand however why Turnbull is concerned about cutting income tax. The bogeyman of bracket creep is a major factor. Bracket creep occurs when purely though wage inflation (ie a pay rise for doing the same job) you are pushed into a higher tax bracket \u2013 and thus you end up paying a higher average tax rate. This was the reason behind the government\u2019s decision last year to raise the second highest tax bracket threshold from $80,000 to $87,000. The Parliamentary Budget Office predicts that by 2020-21 those on median incomes will see the biggest rise in their average tax rate \u2013 up 3.8% points \u2013 and the main reason for it is inflation: But the decision to raise the tax threshold from $80,000 to $87,000 cost $4bn over four years and delivered a tax cut of $315 to the roughly two-and-quarter million taxpayers earning over $87,000. Was the government, for example, to raise the next lowest threshold from $37,000 to $40,000, it would mean a $405 tax cut to the around seven-and-half million people earning over $37,000. So these things get expensive very quickly. And in an environment where the government is already basing its return to surplus on very optimistic wage-growth predictions, being able to keep to that path while simultaneously reducing the amount of revenue it will raise via income tax is not maths that adds up. At the very least the government would need to either cut government services or payments, or raise the money elsewhere. So while it is a nice little sentence in a speech that gets the desired headlines, it is unlikely to become anything close to reality until at least after 2020-21. And it is worth remembering that the reality will also contain the other side of the equation. You can either cut taxes and increase the deficit, or you can cut taxes while also cutting spending or raising other taxes in order to keep the budget unaffected. You cannot do both.",

The bogeyman of bracket creep is a major factor.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Shares in Thomas Cook have fallen sharply after its UK profits were hit by political upheaval in the Mediterranean, food poisoning fraudsters and Hurricane Irma. The string of setbacks meant underlying profit in the tour operator\u2019s UK arm fell by \u00a334m in the year to the end of September despite a 3% increase in revenue. The biggest factor weighing on Thomas Cook was the fallout from disruption to popular tourist spots, which meant Spain\u2019s holiday market was more crowded than ever. Terror attacks in Egypt and Tunisia, as well as political turmoil in Turkey, resulted in tourists steering clear of the eastern Mediterranean in favour of Spain. This allowed hotels to raise prices but fierce competition with rivals such as Tui limited Thomas Cook\u2019s ability to pass the increase in costs through to customers. The company felt the effect on its profit margins, traditionally tight in the travel sector, which fell from 23.4% to 22.1%. Despite a relatively strong group-wide performance, investors seized on the difficulties in Thomas Cook\u2019s UK operations as a reason for pessimism despite an otherwise strong full-year profit statement. Shares in Thomas Cook fell nearly 9% in early trading, making it the biggest faller on the FTSE 250, while Tui\u2019s stock also fell, albeit by a more modest 1.2%, as investors bet that it would report similar pressures in its full-year figures due next month. \u201cWith destinations in the eastern Mediterranean out of favour following political unrest, holiday providers are dashing headlong into Spanish resorts,\u201d said Nicholas Hyett, an equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown. \u201cThe increased competition is a double whammy for Thomas Cook, pushing up the cost of beds while piling the pressure on pricing as well. The group is making efforts to control costs, and holidaymakers are starting to return to destinations such as Turkey and Egypt that have struggled in recent years. \u201cBut margins in the travel agent sector have always been tight, and news that they\u2019re being squeezed even further is far from welcome.\u201d Thomas Cook\u2019s UK business has also been hit by fraudulent illness claims, in which holidaymakers pretend to have suffered food poisoning or other ailments and seek refunds or compensation from the tour operator. The company said the number of claims had fallen recently, after it tightened up its compensation procedures and started taking legal action against fraudsters. It also suffered increased costs as it tried to meet the needs of 10,000 customers caught up in Hurricane Irma, which devastated parts of the Caribbean earlier this year. The string of problems meant underlying profit in the UK division fell by \u00a334m during the period and Thomas Cook said it would respond by trying to drive passengers towards high-margin destinations such as Turkey and Egypt, as well as cutting costs. At group level, pre-tax profit was up 8% to \u00a346m in the year, stripping out currency effects, on the back of revenues that were 9% higher at \u00a39bn. Thomas Cook\u2019s chief executive, Peter Fankhauser, cited progress in the group\u2019s continental Europe and Nordic businesses, while its airline enjoyed increased profits in a difficult yearin which European carriers such as Air Berlin, Monarch and Alitalia went bust. He also pointed to the group\u2019s fledgling business in China and growth in financial services arm Thomas Cook Money. The tour operator\u2019s prospects could also be boosted by improved sales of its winter holidays, with bookings up 3% and the average selling price also 3% higher. While bookings for next summer are in the early stages, the company said it hoped pressure on the Spanish market would be eased by signs that tourists were returning to Turkey and Egypt, with trips to Greece and Cyprus also showing signs of strong demand. Those investors who kept some or all of their Thomas Cook shares will be rewarded with an increase in their dividend, which is rising by 20% from 0.5% to 0.6%. While the stock market reacted badly to Thomas Cook\u2019s update, its profit statement indicated continued recovery since 2011, when the company had to borrow more money from its lenders as it neared collapse. The tour operator\u2019s share price has risen almost fivefold since slumping to below 20p during its 2011 crisis. \u2022Follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk, or sign up to the daily Business Today email here.",

Most of the action takes place online in this country, with shoppers choosing to bargain hunt from under the duvet using their phone or laptop rather than queueing up outside stores in the early hours. Spending is expected to be up this year as more stores join the event, but experts say bargains may be harder to find as stores battle rising costs and inflation. Spending is expected to be up this year as more stores join the event, but experts say bargains may be harder to find as stores battle rising costs and inflation. Moneysavingexpert.com advises shopping around and researching the items you want to buy rather than relying on discount promises from retailers. They may be offering \u201c70% off\u201d their own price, but it doesn\u2019t mean the same item isn\u2019t cheaper elsewhere. Sticking to a shopping list of items you actually want, using price tracker tools such as Camelcamelcamel and watching out for discount codes are also a good idea. Finally, be wary of \u201ctoo good to be true\u201d prices \u2013 quite possibly they are \u2013 so carefully check terms and conditions and buyer reviews for sites you\u2019ve not used before offering very cheap prices.

      "bodyText": "Water firms have hastily distanced themselves from their own admissions that they use divining rods to detect leaks amid widespread alarm at publicly listed companies using witchcraft. Ten of the 12 water companies in the UK told the science blogger Sally Le Page, via Twitter, that they use the practice of water dowsing despite the lack of scientific evidence for its effectiveness. But after the disclosure was first reported in the Guardian and picked up by media across the world, many of the companies have tried to row back on their admissions or blame rogue engineers. One of them, Welsh Water, has even deleted a tweet in which it acknowledged using dowsing rods. Le Page took the precaution of taking a screen shot of the Welsh Water\u2019s admission, alongside a smiley face emoji, before the company erased the tweet. Other companies have not denied that some of their engineers are still use divining rods but have stressed that they do not spend money on the practice. The clarification comes after Christopher Hassall, a specialist in water management at the Leeds University school of biology, expressed alarm at the continuing use of what he dismissed as witchcraft. Hassal, who has worked with a number of water companies, including Yorkshire Water, to try to modernise \u201csome very peculiar practices\u201d, called for the water regulator, Ofwat, to intervene. \u201cIf they are going to be passing the charges on to us for using dubious practices, then that\u2019s something everyone in the UK should be concerned about,\u201d he told the Guardian. United Utilities is one of several of the companies involved to have since pointed out that its engineers are not issued with divining rods. After telling Le Page that the company does use them from \u201ctime to time\u201d, it subsequently tweeted only \u201cone or two of our engineers were interested enough to learn how to use them in their spare time\u201d. Anglian Water claims its admission of using divining rods and an apparent invitation to Le Page to demonstrate their effectiveness was misunderstood. It has since said: \u201cIf you don\u2019t know where a water pipe is, you have to dig to find out. Most will take an educated guess, some may add a little superstition as well. If we thought it was costing customers money then of course we\u2019d clamp down, but it doesn\u2019t. \u201cWe suggested Sally come see our real leakage tech \u2013 drones and robots \u2013 and then compare to divining rods, which won\u2019t work. We accept the tweet wasn\u2019t explicit enough and we were probably too jovial today but we did it honestly and it\u2019s been taken out of context.\u201d In a statement to the Guardian, the company added: \u201cUsing dowsing rods to find leaks is an old-fashioned method. We don\u2019t spend money on it, or issue rods to our engineers.\u201d Le Page began asking questions about the practice when her parents reported seeing an engineer from Severn Trent \u201cwalking around holding two bent tent pegs to locate a pipe\u201d near their home in Stratford-upon-Avon. Severn Trent told the Mirror: \u201cWe don\u2019t issue divining rods to our engineers but we believe some of our engineers use them. As long as the leak is found and repaired quickly, by whatever means, we\u2019re happy and so are our customers.\u201d Southern Water took a similar line. It said: \u201cIt\u2019s not company policy to use dowsing rods, although it\u2019s possible some of our leakage technicians may use them. However it\u2019s done, finding and fixing leaks as quickly as possible remains the most important thing to us, and we\u2019ll continue [to] work hard to drive down our leakage figures.\u201d The industry\u2019s trade body, Water UK, also blamed individual engineers. It said: \u201cThe reality is that water companies are spending millions of pounds each year on innovative leakage detection schemes such as thermal imaging drones, sonic listening devices and other high-tech electronic mapping equipment, which has helped reduce leakages by a third since the 1990s, and it\u2019s unlikely that a few individuals doing some unofficial divining has had much impact.\u201d The physicist Helen Czerski, a research fellow in the department of mechanical engineering at University College London, tweeted that the companies should be ashamed of themselves. Wessex Water and Northern Ireland Water were the only two company in the UK to state that they did not use water divining. In a statement to the Guardian, Northern Ireland Water said: \u201cNI Water has never used divining as a method to detect leakage although it does understand that prior to the formation of the company it was a technique which was used by some water technicians on a totally informal basis to locate pipes. NI Water uses a range of modern industry techniques and high quality equipment to locate leaks.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Britons are putting off major home appliance and furniture purchases and DIY projects, in the latest sign that household budgets are under pressure in the run-up to Christmas. On Tuesday, the DIY chain B&amp;Q, the department store chain John Lewis and AO, the online electrical retailer, joined the list of companies warning of tough trading conditions, as the slowdown in the housing market has a knock-on effect on demand for everything from fitted kitchens and bathrooms to sofas and washing machines. The AO World chief executive, Steve Caunce, said the retailer was experiencing \u201cchallenging\u201d conditions in the UK as fewer house moves depressed demand for new appliances. \u201cWe saw the market getting tough at the back end of 2016 and right now it is about the same,\u201d Caunce said. \u201cIt does feel like the customer is very nervous \u2026 there\u2019s Brexit, talk of inflation. Lots of things we can do very little about.\u201d AO shares closed down nearly 2% after its operating losses widened to \u00a312m for the six months to 30 September, up from \u00a32.8m a year ago. The fall deeper into the red was blamed on its sponsorship of ITV\u2019s Britain\u2019s Got Talent, which was behind a 50% increase in marketing costs to \u00a317.4m for the half year. Despite the tough environment, AO\u2019s UK sales were up 7.4% to \u00a3316.8m as the company benefited from the trend towards shopping online. The gloom knocked the shares of retailers with large household goods businesses including AO rival Dixons Carphone, discount chain B&amp;M and Debenhams. \u201cThe consumer is under pressure,\u201d Kate Calvert, a retail analyst at Investec, said. \u201cReal income is declining and, now inflation has come back, there is a shift in retail sales towards food. \u201cNon-food sales have dropped off as consumers only have a certain amount of money in their pocket and they have to eat.\u201d B&amp;Q, which is owned by Kingfisher, said like-for-like sales were down by 1.9% in the three months to 31 October, with its kitchen and bathroom business suffering in the cooling housing market. Sales of seasonal goods also dropped by 7.1% as a cool, wet August hit sales of outdoor paint, wood treatments and barbecues. There was a better performance from Screwfix, B&amp;Q\u2019s sister chain, which is aimed at the trade. Its underlying sales increased by 10.2%, resulting in an overall 1.5% rise in UK like-for-like sales for the Kingfisher group. The company remains cautious on the economic backdrop in the UK but expects to meet profit targets. The poor performance at B&amp;Q came despite problems at its rival Homebase, at which there was a near-14% slump in sales in the three months to the end of September as Bunnings, its new Australian owner, tries to transform the chain. It blamed the disastrous sales performance on the large-scale clearance of discontinued stock. John Lewis managed its first week of sales growth in two months as sales of clothing and technology were bolstered by the arrival of cold weather, the launch of the iPhone X and price matching with early Black Friday sales. However, homeware sales last week were down by 1.4% as sales of expensive items such as fitted carpets and kitchens fell. Last month Paula Nickolds, the managing director of John Lewis, said sales of expensive items for the home were \u201creally challenged\u201d as housing sales remained low. A slump in spending on Christmas getaways, as well as cutbacks on clothing and household goods, are expected to result in a 0.1% dip in UK household spending over the festive period, according to research compiled by IHS Markit for Visa. The research predicted that sales of household goods would fall by 1% in November and December, compared with the same period last year, while clothing and footwear sales would be down by 0.5%. UK consumers\u2019 spending power is being squeezed as inflation rises and wage growth falter. They are also coming to terms with higher borrowing costs after the Bank of England increased interest rates for the first time in more than a decade. The tough high-street conditions mean retailers are fighting hard for business in this week\u2019s Black Friday sales. Caunce said it was not yet clear how many consumers were holding back their cash to make the most of the deals on tech goods, from TVs to headphones to coffee machines. \u201cI\u2019d be astonished if Black Friday wasn\u2019t the biggest trading day of the year. I think the UK consumer is understanding it more and more,\u201d Caunce said. \u201cWe are very happy with what has happened so far, but need to understand how that will impact the rest of the period, particularly Friday.\u201d \u2022 Follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk, or sign up to the daily Business Today email here.",

The fall deeper into the red was blamed on its sponsorship of ITV\u2019s Britain\u2019s Got Talent, which was behind a 50% increase in marketing costs to \u00a317.4m for the half year. </p> <p>Despite the tough environment, AO\u2019s UK sales were up 7.4% to \u00a3316.8m as the company benefited from the trend towards shopping online. </p> <p>The gloom knocked the shares of retailers with large household goods businesses including AO rival Dixons Carphone, discount chain B&amp;M and Debenhams.</p> <p>\u201cThe consumer is under pressure,\u201d Kate Calvert, a retail analyst at Investec, said. \u201cReal income is declining and, now inflation has come back, there is a shift in retail sales towards food. </p> <p>\u201cNon-food sales have dropped off as consumers only have a certain amount of money in their pocket and they have to eat.\u201d</p> <p>B&amp;Q, which is owned by Kingfisher, said like-for-like sales were down by 1.9% in the three months to 31 October, with its kitchen and bathroom business suffering in the cooling housing market. </p> <p>Sales of seasonal goods also dropped by 7.1% as a cool, wet August hit sales of outdoor paint, wood treatments and barbecues.</p> <p>There was a better performance from Screwfix, B&amp;Q\u2019s sister chain, which is aimed at the trade. Its underlying sales increased by 10.2%, resulting in an overall 1.5% rise in UK like-for-like sales for the Kingfisher group. The company remains cautious on the economic backdrop in the UK but expects to meet profit targets.</p> <p>The poor performance at B&amp;Q came despite problems at its rival Homebase, at which there was a near-14% slump in sales in the three months to the end of September as Bunnings, its new Australian owner, tries to transform the chain. It blamed the disastrous sales performance on the large-scale clearance of discontinued stock. </p> <p>John Lewis managed its first week of sales growth in two months as sales of clothing and technology were bolstered by the arrival of cold weather, the launch of the iPhone X and price matching with early Black Friday sales. </p> <p>However, homeware sales last week were down by 1.4% as sales of expensive items such as fitted carpets and kitchens fell. </p> <p>Last month Paula Nickolds, the managing director of John Lewis, said <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/oct/20/john-lewis-to-provide-brand-experience-manager-for-shoppers-at-oxford-store\">sales of expensive items for the home were \u201creally challenged\u201d as housing sales remained low</a>.</p> <p>A slump in spending on Christmas getaways, as well as cutbacks on clothing and household goods, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/nov/20/uk-shoppers-expected-to-cut-back-this-christmas\">are expected to result in a 0.1% dip in UK household spending over the festive period</a>, according to research compiled by IHS Markit for Visa. </p> <p>The research predicted that sales of household goods would fall by 1% in November and December, compared with the same period last year, while clothing and footwear sales would be down by 0.5%.</p> <p>UK consumers\u2019 spending power is being squeezed as inflation rises and wage growth falter.

Pfizer, together with a small UK company called Flynn Pharma, was fined \u00a390m last December for \u201cexcessive and unfair\u201d pricing of an anti-epilepsy drug. GlaxoSmithKline and two small firms were later hit for \u00a345m for conspiring to delay competition on an antidepressant. Now comes an accusation that the Canadian firm Concordia Healthcare abused its dominant position to overcharge the NHS on a thyroid treatment. The price of the drug rose by almost 6,000% while production costs remained \u201cbroadly stable,\u201d says the CMA. The Concordia case is similar to the Pfizer one in that the price hikes followed the de-branding of a medicine. De-branding takes a drug into an unregulated pricing regime where competition from generic manufacturers is supposed to act as a brake on prices. In practice, competition doesn\u2019t always arrive \u2013 thus a pack of Concordia\u2019s liothyronine tablets rose from \u00a34.46 before de-branding in 2007 to \u00a3258 by July this year. The government has tried to address the problem by creating powers to control prices of generic medicines. But the open question is how severely the system has been abused. The CMA says its investigators are pursuing another seven cases involving several companies, which may suggest a pricing loophole has been quietly exploited for years. The CMA is doing its bit, but there is a strong case for a wider investigation that looks beyond the narrow application of competition and consumer-protection laws. As it is, NHS England\u2019s response felt limp \u2013 the CMA\u2019s action \u201csends an important enforcement signal \u2026 that taxpayers and the NHS will not tolerate market abuses,\u201d it said. Well, yes, signals are important. But taxpayers and patients also want to know if the NHS has been taken for a ride on generics, whether officials are wiser to pricing games and whether the new law is up to the job. There is scope for a parliamentary inquiry. And, since the companies all shout about their ethical codes of conduct, they would surely be happy to be questioned in detail about how they deal with the NHS. McCall will face more turbulence at ITV than easyJet Dame Carolyn McCall, chief executive of easyJet, won\u2019t regret her decision to quit to become ITV\u2019s boss in the new year. She\u2019s had seven mostly successful years at the airline and few executives get to lead two FTSE 100 household names. All the same, the medium-term job looks easier at the firm she\u2019s leaving than the one she\u2019s joining. EasyJet\u2019s full-year profits were knocked, as they were bound to be, by a \u00a3101m hit from the fall of sterling. But \u00a3408m, down from \u00a3494m, was a decent result. The European short-haul airline market was going through one its regular bouts of over-expansion and ticket prices fell. The position is now reversing \u2013 and quickly. Monarch and Air Berlin have gone bust, Alitalia is on its knees and Ryanair has cancelled a few winter flights while it hunts for pilots. Fares will rise for the first time in almost two years. Air Berlin\u2019s downfall has also allowed easyJet to bag 25 A320s plus landing slots in Tegel airport in Berlin on the cheap. The reorganisation costs are more severe \u2013 \u00a360m of losses in year one plus \u00a3100m in one-off costs \u2013 but enhancement to earnings is promised in year two. In time, it\u2019s possible that a similar attractive slice could be carved out of Alitalia. In short, the competitive landscape looks clearer than it has done in ages. McCall always boasted that easyJet is a \u201cstructural winner\u201d \u2013 it rings true. It\u2019s harder to say the same about ITV on current form. The broadcaster has a near-monopoly on free-to-air commercial TV advertising slots in the UK \u2013 a useful structural advantage \u2013 but it is completing a second year of falling advertising revenues and the spectre of Netflix looms. ITV, even after a 25% fall in its share price this year, is still the bigger company in stock market terms \u2013 \u00a36bn versus easyJet\u2019s \u00a35bn \u2013 but McCall will have done well if there\u2019s still a \u00a31bn gap seven years from now. Did TCI go too far in its feud over Rolet? The Children\u2019s Investment Fund (TCI), the hedge fund seeking to oust Donald Brydon as chairman of the London Stock Exchange, should be careful not to overplay its hand. It asked a fair question \u2013 why is LSE chief executive Xavier Rolet leaving? And it called an meeting of shareholders to vote on Brydon\u2019s survival, as is its right as a 5% shareholder. But to accuse the LSE of threatening a character assassination of Rolet is bizarre. TCI called the meeting and the company has to issue a circular to shareholders. Brydon &amp; co should have spoken up at the outset, of course, but they\u2019re still allowed to give their side of the story.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Adani is reportedly close to securing the loans it requires to build its railway from Abbot Point to the Galilee basin, allowing coal from the proposed Carmichael coalmine to be exported through the Great Barrier Reef, according to the ABC. The news comes as preparations for construction of the railway pick up pace and protesters step up last-ditch efforts to stop it from proceeding. Coal industry insiders were told by a director of Adani Mining the company had secured funding from China for the rail project, the ABC has reported. The report appears to confirm earlier suggestions the Chinese state-owned enterprise China Machinery Engineering Corporation (CMEC) had been in the running for contracts in the railroad\u2019s construction. It also coincides with railway sleepers being moved in and worker facilities being constructed, further suggesting financial backing is at least close to being met for the project. Experts say Chinese government financing would inevitably come with conditions requiring materials to be sourced from China, further undermining the credibility of Adani\u2019s claims the project will bring jobs to Australia. Reports of the possible loan deal have not shed any more light on which Chinese companies or agencies are involved, beyond revelations from earlier this month. Meanwhile, protesters have increased their efforts to halt the mine and called on Australians from around the country to join them. On Tuesday a group of religious leaders from the Australian Religious Response to Climate Change blockaded the construction zone but were quickly arrested and moved on by police. A spokeswoman for the group Frontline Action on Coal (Flac) told the Guardian there were dozens of protesters permanently in Bowen, near Abbot Point, and they plan similar actions at least every week between now and Christmas, with the aim of halting the construction of the railway. \u201cActivities will continue over the coming months to ensure that work on the railway does not proceed,\u201d the spokeswoman told Guardian Australia. She said Flac was calling on people to join their movement and get involved with the protests. \u201cEveryone, locally and nationally, is encouraged to get involved,\u201d she said. \u201cThe way that they would get involved is to sign the pledge on the Flac website. When they put their details in there will be someone who will follow up with them.\u201d Asked what the Chinese financing would mean for Queensland suppliers, the premier, Annastacia Palaszczuk, said: \u201cWe have a buy Queensland policy and also no 457 visas. They know the policy. \u201cThey have already been making commitments to purchasing things already, supplies and services in Townsville and Maryborough.\u201d The Greens leader, Richard Di Natale, said it was \u201cremarkable\u201d that there was still support for the project in Australia. \u201cWhy are we looking at supporting a mine that will now be funded by the Chinese government,\u201d Di Natale said. News of Adani\u2019s potential involvement with Chinese lenders came after press releases from earlier in the year emerged this month. Adani already has links with CMEC. In January 2017, the Chinese company\u2019s president, Zhang Chun, met a delegation from Adani, as well as David Overall, the boss of the Australian mining construction company Downer EDI. Downer EDI told the ASX it received letters informing it of Adani\u2019s intent to contract the company for the construction of the mine and associated infrastructure but that no binding contract had been entered into. Following the meeting, the press release said CEMC \u201choped to cooperate with Adani and Downer to take part in financing, construction and operation of relevant coalmines and railway projects\u201d. Tim Buckley from the pro-renewables Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis said since that time negotiations had progressed and \u201cCMEC is still negotiating to be potentially involved as a contractor and financier for the proposed Carmichael rail project\u201d. With CEMC\u2019s involvement, the project could get access to additional financing from the state-owned China Construction Bank and Export-Import Bank of China. The possibility was highlighted in October when Jeyakumar Janakaraj, the chief executive officer of Adani Australia, told Reuters the company was in talks to secure loans from export credit agencies. Last month it was revealed that Australian federal ministers had written a formal letter to China\u2019s government to confirm that the controversial coal project had passed all necessary environmental approvals.",

When they put their details in there will be someone who will follow up with them.\u201d</p> <p>Asked what the Chinese financing would mean for Queensland suppliers, the premier, Annastacia Palaszczuk, said: \u201cWe have a buy Queensland policy and also no 457 visas. They know the policy.</p> <p>\u201cThey have already been making commitments to purchasing things already, supplies and services in Townsville and Maryborough.\u201d</p> <p>The Greens leader, Richard Di Natale, said it was \u201cremarkable\u201d that there was still support for the project in Australia. </p> <p>\u201cWhy are we looking at supporting a mine that will now be funded by the Chinese government,\u201d Di Natale said.</p> <p>News of Adani\u2019s potential involvement with Chinese lenders came after press releases from earlier in the year emerged this month.</p> <p>Adani already has links with CMEC. <a href=\"http://en.cmec.com/xwzx/gsxw/201701/t20170118_136838.html\">In January 2017</a>, the Chinese company\u2019s president, Zhang Chun, met a delegation from Adani, as well as David Overall, the boss of the Australian mining construction company Downer EDI.</p> <p>Downer EDI <a href=\"http://www.asx.com.au/asxpdf/20170606/pdf/43jrpgv3tdw6jd.pdf\">told the ASX</a> it received letters informing it of Adani\u2019s intent to contract the company for the construction of the mine and associated infrastructure but that no binding contract had been entered into.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/nov/14/queensland-labor-finds-its-mojo-as-lnp-cosies-up-to-one-nation\">Queensland Labor finds its mojo as LNP cosies up to One Nation</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Following the meeting, the press release said CEMC \u201choped to cooperate with Adani and Downer to take part in financing, construction and operation of relevant coalmines and railway projects\u201d.</p> <p>Tim Buckley from the pro-renewables Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis said since that time negotiations had progressed and \u201cCMEC is still negotiating to be potentially involved as a contractor and financier for the proposed Carmichael rail project\u201d.</p> <p>With CEMC\u2019s involvement, the project could get access to additional financing from the state-owned China Construction Bank and Export-Import Bank of China. The possibility was highlighted in October when Jeyakumar Janakaraj, the chief executive officer of Adani Australia, <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/adani-ent-australia-mine/update-1-adani-aims-to-wrap-up-australia-project-funding-by-march-idUSL4N1ME308\">told Reuters</a> the company was in talks to secure loans from export credit agencies.<br></p> <p>Last month it was revealed that Australian federal ministers <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/oct/26/australian-ministers-write-to-china-to-confirm-approval-of-carmichael-mine\">had written a formal letter to China\u2019s government</a> to confirm that the controversial coal project had passed all necessary environmental approvals.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Australia\u2019s richest woman, mining magnate Gina Rinehart, has awarded Barnaby Joyce $40,000 for services to the agricultural sector. At a gala dinner in Canberra on Tuesday, Rinehart gave the inaugural agricultural and related industries award to Joyce, describing him as a \u201cchampion of the industry\u201d. Labor immediately took aim at the award, with the opposition leader, Bill Shorten, labelling it a \u201c$40,000 cash present\u201d. Joyce has said he will refuse the cash. The Nationals leader, a close personal friend of Rinehart and former agriculture and water minister, is currently battling for his political life in the New England byelection after the high court ruled him ineligible to sit in parliament because of dual New Zealand citizenship. Rinehart thanked Joyce for taking \u201ctime out of your campaigning schedule to come here \u2013 to be here for the industry you love and support\u201d. \u201cWhat a great voice for Australian agriculture,\u201d she said. \u201cThe agricultural industry is fortunate to have had such a dedicated, understanding and enthusiastic minister \u2013 one with years of first-hand experience \u2013 a real Aussie country boy and boy, do we hope you return.\u201d Footage of the event shows Joyce stood up to accept the award and giant cheque, before modestly exclaiming \u201chooley dooley \u2013 rightio\u201d. In addition to being the chair of Hancock Prospecting, Rinehart has extensive agricultural holdings and is the part owner of the $386m S Kidman and Co cattle company which has leasehold over 80,000 sq km in Australia\u2019s north. At a press conference on Wednesday, Shorten asked: \u201cWhy is a mining millionaire giving a Turnbull government minister a $40,000 cash present? \u201cThis is very unhealthy for our democracy,\u201d he said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t look right, it doesn\u2019t smell right. This is very, very unusual and concerning conduct.\u201d A spokesman for Joyce told Guardian Australia he \u201cliterally had no idea\u201d he would be receiving the award. He dismissed Shorten\u2019s criticisms as \u201ccompletely irrelevant\u201d because Joyce will decline the $40,000 cash prize. Labor\u2019s agriculture spokesman, Joel Fitzgibbon, said the award had turned the National Agriculture Day event into \u201cthe festival of Barnaby\u201d. \u201cGina\u2019s agriculture award could have gone to many people in agriculture \u2013 our innovative farmers, entrepreneurs, scientists, environmentalists and those who add value to our products,\u201d he said. \u201cBut no, it went to Barnaby Joyce who is facing an expensive byelection in New England.\u201d In her speech, Rinehart praised Australia\u2019s 130,000 agribusinesses, which employ 1.6m people, noting their contribution through \u201cthe income tax they pay ... company taxes, payroll tax, stamp duty and licenses\u201d. \u201cIf we didn\u2019t have a sustainable agriculture industry, who would be paying the then missing taxes to support our defence, police, roads, airports, elderly, parks, public sporting facilities and much more.\u201d",
