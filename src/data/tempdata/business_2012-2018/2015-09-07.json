Manpower said its survey of 2,100 employers suggested many were scaling back recruitment plans for the rest of the year, with some blaming the new minimum pay for over-25s, which comes into effect next April. Employers were attempting to avoid paying the new rate by using groups of self-employed workers or focusing recruitment on younger people. Others had put a block on new recruitment altogether, it said. The effect was already being felt in the wider jobs market, with the outlook the least optimistic for three years and job prospects \u201cdwindling\u201d in the runup to Christmas. The report follows accusations by employers\u2019 groups that companies would come under severe strain from the chancellor\u2019s living wage scheme, which he announced in the budget in July. Osborne said he hoped that by 2020 workers would enjoy a basic hourly rate of \u00a39 an hour. The CBI, a leading independent employers\u2019 organisation, responded by saying a rise from the current minimum wage rate of \u00a36.70 was a \u201cgamble\u201d that damaged Britain\u2019s flexible employment market. Contractors to the public sector, especially in the long-term care sector, privately warned they will need to pass on the costs in higher charges to local authorities and the NHS. James Hick, a spokesman for Manpower, said: \u201cThe national living wage is sending shockwaves through the UK labour market. An unintended consequence of its introduction is that firms might try to bypass the legislation altogether. We anticipate that some employers may look to mitigate the extra costs by taking on more young or self-employed workers, who are not entitled to the national living wage. Support services firm Interserve recently announced that the extra annual wage bill for its 15,000 cleaners could amount to \u00a315m, or 12% of its annual profits. Mears Group estimated the cost of meeting the wage rises for its 4,000 care workers would be \u00a35m, or 10% of its annual profits. \u201cFaced with a wage bill of this size, some employers are thinking twice about taking on new workers,\u201d Hick said. Several industries have moved towards models of employment based on managing groups of self-employed workers. Logistics companies such as Yodel allocate deliveries to self-employed drivers who are paid according to the time spent or number of deliveries. Drivers work for several logistics operators to satisfy HMRC rules that prevent self-employed people working for a single employer. Manpower expects the use of self-employed people to become more common in mainstream industries, especially where the internet allows workers to be managed remotely. Living wage campaigners have argued that the minimum wage had little impact on pay rates when it was introduced in 1999 and said the living wage would be absorbed by employers. But the UK has seen a surge in the number of self-employed people since 2001, which some economists have blamed in part on the minimum wage. The Manpower report found the jobs market was worse in the north-east, north-west and Yorkshire and Humberside, which are lagging behind the UK average. The north-east was especially badly hit by the slowdown, having been one of the last regions to recover after the banking crash of 2008. Steep cuts in public sector jobs have taken their toll alongside fears of higher wage costs from the living wage. A fifth of workers in the north-east are employed in the public sector, the highest proportion in England, closely followed by Yorkshire and the Humber and the north-west. \u201cThe north-east has really struggled and the national living wage will compound problems it has experienced with the loss of public sector jobs,\u201d Hick said. There was a marked divide between job prospects in the north and those in London, showing that the government\u2019s plans to rebalance the economy through the creation of a so-called northern powerhouse had so far failed to ignite, the report added. \u2022 This article was amended on 8 September 2015. An earlier version said Yodel was part-owned by Amazon. Amazon owns warrants that give it the option of buying a 5% stake in the company, but to date it has not exercised the warrants.",

    "webTitle": "Share buyback is a terrible advert for Glencore's abilities", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The curse of the share buyback has struck again. Glencore has become the latest company to spend hundreds of millions of pounds buying back its own shares only to find that it really could have done with the cash after all. Ivan Glasenberg, the mining giant\u2019s chief executive, launched a $1bn (\u00a3654m) buyback last year, claiming he wanted Glencore to avoid having a \u201clazy\u201d balance sheet. Well, he certainly made sure he has plenty of work to do. The company has announced it will sell $2.5bn of new shares, suspend dividend payments, halt operations at two African mines and sell assets in order to reduce its net debt by roughly $10bn. Given that Glencore makes its money from playing markets, the share buyback and the equity issue are a spectacularly bad advert for its abilities. Other recent ill-timed buybacks include Marks &amp; Spencer committing to spend \u00a3600m in 2008, just weeks before a major profits warning, and Morrisons announcing a \u00a31bn buyback in 2011 before most of the supermarket sector went into meltdown. Too often, buybacks are used to flatter the underlying performance of a business \u2013 which they achieve by boosting earnings per share and shareholder returns. When a chief executive cannot find more useful things to do with cash other than return it to investors, serious questions should be asked. Glencore spent most of its $1bn before last December when the company\u2019s shares traded between 280p and 330p. They now stand at just 131.80p, even after rallying 7% on Monday. The surge was partly a relief rally as investors backed Glasenberg\u2019s plan, but it was also caused by hedge funds cashing in their winnings after betting against Glencore. Four hedge funds \u2013 Davidson Kempner European Partners, Lansdowne Partners, Passport Capital, and Sunrise Partners \u2013 have made serious money by short selling 3.5% of Glencore between them. Their bet shows that plenty in the City were already concerned about Glencore\u2019s finances when, only three weeks ago, Glasenberg confirmed an interim dividend worth almost $800m. Glasenberg and his finance director, Steven Kalmin, said \u201crecent stakeholder engagement\u201d since then had persuaded the Glencore management to act. Their next decision is how to raise the $2.5bn. The size of the equity issue has been chosen deliberately so that it is less than 10% of Glencore\u2019s existing shares in issue, which is the threshold for a placing. However, a placing would ignore the pre-emption rights of existing investors. A rights issue is the most likely option because that would allow Glencore\u2019s current shareholders to avoid being diluted, while a debt for equity swap is surely the nuclear option. At least Glencore shareholders know that Glasenberg, who owns more than 8% of the company himself, is also feeling their pain. Tesco is bruised by Homeplus sale Mike Tyson was not particularly renowned for his eloquent prose. However, the former US boxer is responsible for a quote that neatly dismisses the growing obsession with strategy in sport, politics and business. Asked whether he was worried about an opponent\u2019s detailed strategy to defeat him, Tyson said: \u201cEverybody has a plan until they get punched in the mouth.\u201d Tesco, Britain\u2019s biggest retailer, could surely relate to that. The grocer\u2019s decision to sell Homeplus, its South Korean business, is not rooted in deep strategic thinking. Instead, Tesco simply needs to raise a lot of cash. Selling Homeplus was the quickest route to doing it. There is little to celebrate about watching one of Britain\u2019s leading companies rein in its international ambitions. Homeplus was arguably Tesco\u2019s biggest overseas success. It was certainly the most profitable. However, following a slump in group profits and a high-profile accounting scandal \u2013 the punch in the mouth in this case \u2013 Tesco has been forced to flog the business. Sir Terry Leahy spent years talking about Tesco becoming a global business and how it was reducing its reliance on the UK. Now, the company\u2019s overseas ambitions have been undone by failure at home. On the plus side, Tesco has raised a much-needed \u00a34bn as it tries to pay off \u00a322bn of debt, including the pension deficit and leases. However, rating agencies Moody\u2019s and Standard &amp; Poor\u2019s have already warned that the sale will not lead to Tesco\u2019s junk credit rating being upgraded. This is because Tesco is selling off profits as well as assets. Trading has got tougher for Tesco in South Korea due to new restrictions on when its stores can open on Sundays. But still, Homeplus\u2019s profit margins have consistently been the highest in the group and last year were 5.4%, compared with 1.1% in the UK. The deal will therefore lower Tesco\u2019s earnings per share and result in the company booking a loss of \u00a3150m in its next accounts. The financial consequences of the deal show the lack of strategic logic. The sale of Homeplus won\u2019t even knock out Tesco\u2019s problems.",

      "bodyText": "Chinese stock markets tumbled again on Monday as it emerged that the Beijing authorities spent nearly $100bn last month propping up the yuan. The $94bn (\u00a361bn) fall in central bank reserves was the biggest on record, although in percentage terms it was the biggest for three years. Investors in China returning to their trading desks after a long weekend reacted to falls in stocks in the US and Europe on Friday. The sell-off pushed the Shanghai and Shenzhen CSI 300 index down by 3.4%, leaving the wider Shanghai composite index down by 2.5%. It came despite the country\u2019s central bank governor, Zhou Xiaochuan, trying to calm nerves, arguing that the \u201ccorrection in the stock market is almost done\u201d. He predicted markets would be more stable after weeks of turbulence. His message was reinforced by China\u2019s top economic planning agency, which declared that the economy\u2019s growth prospects were improving. The NDRC said: \u201cThe power usage, rail freight, as well as real estate prices and turnover have all improved into August, indicating the economy is stabilising amid fluctuations.\u201d Beijing also received a show of international support over the weekend. G20 finance ministers and central bankers said they backed last month\u2019s yuan devaluation, as part of the difficult journey to a more market-determined exchange rate. China suddenly depreciated the value of the yuan against the dollar last month after a surprise fall in exports in July. Investors around the world panicked at the move which triggered weeks of turmoil on global markets. To prevent the yuan falling too far Beijing more than doubled the funds it used to support the currency during August to $93.9bn.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "A City investment firm is to vote against the re-election of Sports Direct\u2019s non-executive directors and executive deputy chairman, Mike Ashley, at the retailer\u2019s annual shareholder meeting on Wednesday. Ashley Hamilton Claxton, corporate governance manager at Royal London Asset Management (RLAM), which owns about \u00a38.3m of Sports Direct shares, said: \u201cWe have lost confidence in the board and are very concerned about the long list of corporate governance failings that have not been addressed.\u201d The investment firm, which manages a total of \u00a383.4bn of assets, particularly singled out the attendance record of Ashley, who founded the company. \u201cWe question how a board can effectively function when the executive deputy chairman fails to attend four board meetings, even if they are unscheduled,\u201d Hamilton Claxton said. While RLAM\u2019s shareholding is small \u2013 less than 1% of Sports Direct\u2019s stock \u2013 the firm\u2019s strong stance is the first sign that City investors are being swayed by growing criticism of the retailer\u2019s practices. Sports Direct also faces protests outside the meeting at its headquarters in Shirebrook and at 17 stores around the country by members of Unite dressed as Dickensian workers. The union is demanding an end to \u201cVictorian\u201d labour practices at the Shirebrook warehouse, and want a commitment to pay the living wage, as calculated by independent analysts, of \u00a37.85 per hour. Luke Primarolo, Unite regional officer, said: \u201cLow paid agency workers on zero-hours contracts are being subjected to working conditions that are more akin to a Dickensian workhouse than a FTSE 100 company\u2019s warehouse.\u201d The union, which filed a pay claim last month asking Sports Direct to move thousands of zero-hours workers on to permanent contracts, launched an online petition on Monday urging Ashley to improve conditions for workers. The retailer has been widely criticised for employing the vast majority of its workers on zero hours contracts, with no guarantee of regular work. Campaigners from ShareAction have teamed up with Unite in order to ask Sports Direct\u2019s board questions about poor working practices, excessive use of agency workers and governance concerns. Catherine Howarth, chief executive of ShareAction, said: \u201cSports Direct\u2019s pattern of relying upon precarious work is alarming to the public and investment community alike.\u201d Sports Direct is potentially facing a tricky annual meeting after the Trade Union Share Owners (TUSO) group, a coalition of pension funds for trade unions including the TUC, Unite and Unison, wrote to Sports Direct\u2019s top 20 investors urging them to vote out chairman Keith Hellawell. PIRC, the shareholder advisory group, is also advising investors to vote against the re-election of Hellawell. It says a lack of communication among members of Sports Direct\u2019s board \u201cputs into question the competency of the board as whole\u201d. One of the City\u2019s most influential shareholder groups, the Investment Association, has also issued its strongest warning signal \u2013 a \u201cred top\u201d alert after shareholders were asked to approve lower profit targets for Sports Direct\u2019s long-term share bonus scheme. Under the scheme, Sports Direct\u2019s chief executive, Dave Forsey, is in line to be awarded up to 1m shares \u2013 worth nearly \u00a38m at Monday\u2019s price \u2013 while the finance director, Matt Pearson, is in line for up to 30,000 shares worth \u00a3234,000. New guidance from the Financial Conduct Authority means that for the first time Ashley \u2013 who owns a 55% stake in the company \u2013 can be challenged by other investors. The rules, which govern companies that have a controlling shareholder with a stake of 30% or more, mean the election of non-executive directors must be approved separately by minority shareholders. Companies are able to call another meeting at which all votes are counted together if they want to overrule minority shareholder\u2019s views, but the rules make the process much more transparent.",

Figures from British Summer Fruits, a trade body, indicate that since the start of the season in May growers have produced 2,682 tonnes of cherries \u2013 80% up on the 1,488 tonnes produced by the same time last year. Tesco has more than doubled the amount of cherries sourced from British growers. Last year the supermarket bought more than 335 tonnes of British-grown cherries; this year it has taken more than 750 tonnes \u2013 a rise of 125%.

    "webTitle": "Glencore CEO to shell out $210m during restructuring drive", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Ivan Glasenberg, the billionaire chief executive of Glencore, is to put up some $210m (\u00a3140m) of his own cash as part of a humiliating $10bn programme of fundraising and cuts designed to prepare the company for a \u201cdoomsday scenario\u201d. The huge initiative \u2013 which will still leave the commodity trading and mining empire with a debt mountain of some $20bn \u2013 comes only weeks after the company\u2019s management insisted they were comfortable with the group\u2019s financial position.. Glencore, like many other commodities companies,has been hit by falling prices, as previously booming demand from China has slowed. Last month, it unveiled a 30% decline in profits and last week the company was warned it could lose its prized investment-grade rating if it did not slash its near-$30bn debt pile. The stockmarket value of the firm \u2013 in which Glasenberg owns a stake of 8.4% \u2013 has more than halved this year, and its shares have slumped by a third in the past month. Glencore now plans to raise $2.5bn by selling new shares in the company - with Glasenberg and his senior management committed to buying 22% of them, worth $550m. The group will also be selling some assets and has suspended production at copper mines in Zambia and the Democratic Republic of Congo. It has axed the full year dividend payout to shareholders, and next year\u2019s interim dividend. The series of measures will find the company an extra $10.2bn, which will be used to cut debts \u201cto the low 20 billions of dollars by the end of 2016\u201d, it said. A source close to the group said that following last month\u2019s results announcement, management had been told by shareholders to \u201cget ready for the doomsday scenario\u201d. The source added: \u201cWe don\u2019t believe that will happen, it\u2019s a \u2018what if\u2019.\u201d Glasenberg and his four closest lieutenants, who all became paper billionaires in the group\u2019s 2011 floatation \u2013 Daniel Mat\u00e9, Telis Mistakidis, Tor Peterson and Alex Beard \u2013 own around 20% of the company. To maintain that stake, the five men will now have to find half a billion dollars in cash. Glasenberg said that the senior partners did not want to see their stakes diluted. The company declined to comment on the intentions of its largest shareholder, the sovereign wealth fund Qatar Holding, which overtook Glasenberg as the group\u2019s principal investor when Glencore acquired the Xstrata mining business in 2013. Qatar Holding also did not comment. While Glasenberg must find $210m, he is at least scheduled to receive around $66m later this month, his share of Glencore\u2019s last interim dividend to shareholders. That payment will take the dividends he has received from Glencore since it floated to more than $780m. Sources close to the tycoon implied he has the ready finances to fund the purchase. Glencore\u2019s 2011 float was among the largest \u2013 and most controversial \u2013 ever seen in London. At the time, the gargantuan listing valued the Switzerland-based company at about \u00a337bn \u2013 despite its reputation for secrecy, and scepticism that it could maintain its huge trading profits. The float meant Glasenberg\u2019s stake was worth almost \u00a36bn. At the time, Glasenberg was positioned as a supreme reader of financial markets But since then, the shares have failed to live up to the pre-flotation hype. They were listed at 530p each but have not hit those levels since. On Monday they were up 9p at 132p on relief at the actions being taken, but Glasenberg\u2019s stake is now worth around \u00a31.5bn. Last year, as Glencore spent \u00a31bn buying back its own shares \u2013 paying an average of 300p each \u2013 Glasenberg was bullish on the prospects for the commodity markets. \u201cThe supercycle ain\u2019t over, China is still buying, demand for commodities hasn\u2019t tapered off, it\u2019s even higher than it\u2019s ever been,\u201d he told Bloomberg. \u201cThe demand is pretty good. We\u2019ll grow. We may do acquisitions where you\u2019re not creating more supply in the market.\u201d Glasenberg made so much money out of the initial share offering that his local authority \u2013 which collects income tax \u2013 had a SFr60m surplus. As a result, his 3,600 neighbours in the picturesque village of R\u00fcschlikon, which overlooks Lake Zurich, were given a 7% tax break. A further reminder of the huge wealth generated for the top executives of the firm came in January, when it emerged that Glasenberg\u2019s colleague Mistakidis had paid more than \u00a346m for a flat in London\u2019s Belgravia. Aside from Glencore management, the remaining 78% of the proposed issue of shares is to be underwritten by Citi and Morgan Stanley, meaning those investment banks will acquire the new Glencore shares if they cannot find enough buyers. Meanwhile, Glencore said around $2.4bn is to be saved by not paying dividends; $2.5bn generated from cost cuts within the business in working capital and capital expenditure; $2bn to be raised from the selling assets, including stakes in agricultural assets; and up to $800m saved reducing loans made by the company.",

      "bodyText": "Tesco is to pay off some of its multibillion-pound debts and could buy back the leases on some stores after securing \u00a34bn from the sale of its Korean business, Homeplus. The supermarket said it could reduce net debt, which stood at \u00a38.5bn in April, by as much as \u00a33.35bn with the proceeds of the sale of Homeplus to a consortium led by MBK Partners, Korea\u2019s largest private equity firm. Dave Lewis, Tesco chief executive, said: \u201cThis sale realises material value for shareholders and allows us to make significant progress on our strategic priority of protecting and strengthening our balance sheet.\u201d He said the money would be used primarily to redeem bonds and other commercial debt over the next 18 months, but might also be used to purchase the leases on some UK stores. Tesco has already sold off assets including its Blinkbox video streaming service and has put Dunnhumby, the company behind the Tesco Clubcard, up for sale as it tries to stave off the need to raise cash in a rights issue. The company\u2019s debts have mounted after sales and profits tumbled amid rising competition from discounters in the UK and in the wake of ill-judged moves into the US and Japan. Moody\u2019s and Standard &amp; Poors credit rating agencies, which have cut Tesco\u2019s debt to junk status, said the sale of Homeplus was a step in the right direction, but not enough to prompt an upgrade the retailer. Sven Reinke, senior credit officer at Moody\u2019s, said: \u201cOur rating already anticipated that Tesco could enter into a transaction of this size. Today\u2019s announcement eases the negative pressure on the current rating. However, for positive pressure, Tesco\u2019s underlying UK business needs to recover and I don\u2019t think we are at that stage yet. We see signs of stabilisation but not of a sustainable recovery.\u201d Clive Black, retail analyst at Shore Capital, said the sale of Homeplus eased Tesco\u2019s financial situation and provided funds to help revitalise the business. But he said: \u201cWe see this as at the expense of one of Tesco\u2019s crown jewels, which we estimate would have contributed 15-20% of group [profits] in this year.\u201d Homeplus, which was set up by Tesco as a joint venture with Samsung in 1999, operates 1,075 stores and 139 shopping malls in South Korea. At one time the chain was seen as a key part of the British supermarket group\u2019s future. But profits have taken a hit after the Korean government introduced new limits on trading hours to protect smaller shops. Tesco said it expected to complete the sale of Homeplus by the end of this year. The buying consortium includes the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board, Public Sector Pension Investment Board and Temasek Holdings.",

      "bodyText": "More than 2,000 City financiers took home more than \u00a3730,000 (\u20ac1m) in 2013, according to the EU banking regulator. One was handed more than \u00a313m. The European Banking Authority said more bankers in the UK received at least \u20ac1m than in the rest of the EU combined. The regulator\u2019s data from across the EU showed 3,178 bankers were paid more than \u20ac1m, of whom 2,086 were based in the UK. The total had fallen from 3,530 in total in 2012, with 2,714 of them in Britain \u2013 although this was due in part to the pound having weakened against the euro, with UK bankers paid in sterling. For the first time, the EBA published more detail about the scale of the pay deals on offer, building on disclosures that began in 2008, when the financial crisis led to clamour for more information about bankers\u2019 pay. The EBA published pay in brackets starting at \u20ac1m. Of the 2,086 in the UK classified as high earners, 1,470 had salaries of between \u20ac1m \u2013 \u20ac2m. Nine received more than \u20ac10m and one was handed \u20ac18.3m. The EBA also published data about all employees of EU institutions regardless of where they were based, capturing employees in the US and Asia. Under this measure, 1,126 of the high earners were in the the bracket between \u20ac1m \u2013 \u20ac1.5m and another 535 between \u20ac1.5m \u2013 \u20ac2m. Thirty-nine bankers received \u20ac5m or more. This measure showed that one outside the EU was in the \u20ac19m \u2013 \u20ac20m bracket. While the average in the UK was \u20ac2m, there were bigger averages in Cyprus, Finland, Spain and Portugal, where there were fewer bankers falling under the remit of the EBA survey. The data covers the last year before the EU cap was introduced, which has limited bonuses to at most double a banker\u2019s salary, if shareholders give specific approval, and shows the impact the ceiling has had on bankers in London. The ratio of bonuses to salaries in 2013 was 410% in the UK while the average across the EU was 104%. \u201cIn some cases the ratio was further increased in 2013, rather than lowered as might have been expected, to phase in the application of the bonus cap for remuneration awarded for the performance year 2014 and onwards,\u201d the EBA said. The EBA has already warned banks that it is on alert for attempts to sidestep the cap by introducing separate payments such as \u201crole-based pay\u201d alongside salaries and bonuses to prevent pay from falling. It is working on new guidelines to tackle this area. For 2013, the EBA found that \u201cremuneration practices within institutions were not sufficiently harmonised, in particular, the application of deferral and payout in instruments differs significantly between member states and between institutions\u201d. The regulator also took a sample of 92 institutions to examine the link between pay and performance. \u201cOverall in 2013, profitability was significantly reduced in many institutions compared with 2012. Consequently the average net profit per staff member was reduced in 2013. Based on the aggregated figures no strong correlation between the average net profit of institutions and the remuneration of identified staff could be observed.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Australian government bureaucrats have admitted to a senate committee they discussed options with cruise operator Bill Milby which could have involved him hiring foreign crew under a foreign flag. Milby, owners\u2019 representative for North Star Cruises Australia (NSCA), has alleged bureaucrats from the Department of Infrastructure and Regional Development advised him he sack his Australian crew, hire foreign staff and reflag his vessels to remain competitive under the Coalition\u2019s changes to coastal shipping. Late on Monday, Milby named Judith Zielke, executive director, surface transport policy division and Michael Sutton, general manager, maritime and shipping branch as the officers who gave that advice. The department has previously denied such advice was provided to Milby. He appeared before a senate committee reviewing the bill and restated his allegations, first contained in a submission on the effect on Australian tourism operators of the proposed changes. Immediately afterwards, Zielke and Sutton appeared in front of the committee. Under sustained questioning from Heffernan, Zielke admitted she had discussed with Milby various options open to Australian ships under the shipping bill amendment. \u201cSo [Milby] was telling the truth when he said that you\u2019d discussed with him the option of going offshore etc?\u201d asked Heffernan. \u201cYes but I don\u2019t believe I provided advice that he should take that option,\u201d said Zielke. Heffernan asked: \u201cDoes that mean no one is telling a lie?\u201d \u201cI understand Mr Milby heard the conversation and reported what he understood the conversation to cover,\u201d Zielke said. Turning to Sutton, Liberal senator Bill Heffernan, chair of the committee, said: \u201cI don\u2019t like what I just heard from the previous witness and I don\u2019t give a rats who\u2019s in government and who\u2019s not and neither does this committee. Emphatically, are you going to deny the words [Milby] just said in the previous evidence?\u201d Sutton said: \u201cWe discussed the options available to all shipping operators, one of them being to retain their current operations ... one of them is the reflagging option.\u201d If the bill is passed, workers on non-Australian flagged vessels would only have to pay Australian wages and conditions if the ships trade in Australia for more than 183 days. It would also streamline requirements to a single shipping licence for boats operating between domestic ports. The revelations appear to contradict Warren Truss, the infrastructure minister and deputy prime minister, who said in question time on Monday that the secretary of his department had assured him that the comments attributed to a department staff member were \u201cinaccurate\u201d. \u201cThe comments attributed to a senior member of the staff of the department are inaccurate and do not reflect accurately the words of the conversation entered into by the staff member concerned,\u201d said Truss. \u201cIt is also important to note that, if the advice was given, it would in fact be inaccurate, because it is not possible under the proposed legislation before the parliament for an Australian cruise ship to have foreign crew and operate on the Australian coast for 12 months of the year.\u201d Milby has said cruise operators would not be able to compete with foreign crews, which are paid as much as one third of Australian wages. He has also said his ships can only effectively operate for a six-month tourist season in northern Australia. After Milby was asked to name the bureaucrats, Labor senator Stephen Conroy suggested he write to the committee if he faced repercussions from the department. Heffernan backed Conroy and said: \u201cWe don\u2019t play games with that, we cut peoples heads off and we don\u2019t care who they are.\u201d Zielke said some companies were looking at continuing paying Australian wages and keeping the current arrangements \u201cno matter what the outcome\u201d. Earlier, Heffernan and the other senators quizzed Milby, who represents NSCA, which runs True North cruises in the Kimberly, which Heffernan noted cost $1,000 a night. Conroy asked Milby what he thought of Tony Abbott and deputy prime minister Warren Truss both suggesting his claims were not true. \u201cI do not tell lies,\u201d said Milby. \u201cI don\u2019t have an issue with the people who gave that advice because if you read the legislation and the explanatory memo, they were telling me the truth. \u201cI\u2019m not trying to pick a fight with the prime minister or the deputy PM but I don\u2019t like being told I am lying ... I take very strong offence at that.\u201d Labor\u2019s transport spokesman Anthony Albanese called on Abbott and Truss to publicly apologise to Milby for questioning his honesty last week by insisting the explosive advice was never given. \u201cIt is shameful that any government would openly canvass replacing the Australian flag with the white flag on Australian jobs,\u201d said Albanese. \u201cBut the real disgrace is that officials were simply providing an honest account of the real effect of Mr Abbott\u2019s ideologically driven reform proposals, which will destroy the Australian shipping industry. Albanese urged the government to drop its legislation, describing it as \u201cWork Choices on Water\u201d. The committee also heard representatives of the Minerals Council of Australia, the Australian Aluminium Council and Australian Institute of Petroleum Ltd speak in favour of any changes which decreased the cost of freight. Nationals senator John Williams said between 2000 and 2012 the volume of freight increased by 57% across Australia and coastal shipping\u2019s share dropped from 27% of total freight to 17%. The committee heard there were 1,177 seafarers working in Australian coastal shipping in 2012. Independent senator Jacqui Lambie asked Zielke if there had been an economic and social analysis of the outcome if those people lose their jobs as ships replace Australian crew. Zielke said it had not been done because the regulatory impact statement assumed \u201cthey get other jobs\u201d. Dale Emmerton, national manager marine and terminals of Tasmanian shipping company Searoad, said that in the worst case scenario where the bill passed, \u201cI assume SeaRoad would be forced to respond to that and seek to lower costs by employing foriegn crews.\u201d He said the government had not considered the cost of redundancies that would result of the legislation. Emmerton said SeaRoad employed between 60-70 seafarers and the cost of those redundancies were between $5m-$6m.",

      "bodyText": "Gypsy tops, skinny jeans and playsuits helped Primark shrug off concerns about a tricky summer for fashion chains to step up sales growth in the UK as it prepares to open its first US store this week. Analysts said sales at Primark\u2019s established UK stores rose by about 3% in the three months to 12 September, up on the 1% to 2% growth seen in the previous three months. \u201cAlthough the weather hasn\u2019t been great, our spring summer ranges came through in the final quarter,\u201d said John Bason, finance director or Primark\u2019s parent group, Associated British Foods. \u201cPrimark has a very strong presence in the UK but it is continuing to take market share.\u201d Bason insisted sales growth in the UK was not driven by discounting. Although Primark\u2019s profits will be down on last year, Bason said this was because of higher discounting last autumn and the cool spring. He added that profit margins were only down over the summer in comparison with last year\u2019s hot season, which meant Primark was able to employ exceptionally low levels of discounting. Despite strong trading at Primark, shares in ABF, which also owns food brands including Kingsmill and produces sugar in the EU and China, dipped 2% on Monday to \u00a330 as it confirmed in a trading update that profits for the year would be hit by falling European sugar prices and currency issues. Bason said sugar prices in the EU had stabilised and it expected to see some recovery in the year ahead. But some analysts said they would also be downgrading their expectations for next year\u2019s profits by as much as 3% because of currency problems, which could hit profit margins by \u00a3100m. That\u2019s because, for example, the relative strength of the dollar, which Primark uses to pay suppliers in Asia, versus the pound will hit margins on autumn/winter clothing. ABF said the strength of the pound and the weakness of the euro as well as some Asian currencies would also mean a \u00a330m hit to profits translated into sterling in the year to 12 September and more than that next year. Primark\u2019s sales rose 13% for the full year as it opened 9% more space including new outlets in France, Germany and the Netherlands. This year, the group will open 1.5m sq ft of new space compared with just under 1m sq ft last year. Nearly a third of that new space will be in the US where Primark plans seven stores in the next year. The first will open in Boston\u2019s Downtown Crossing on Thursday followed by the King of Prussia mall in Philadelphia in November. Bason said Primark felt well-prepared for Thursday: \u201cWe have got a good location and a great building but the proof of the pudding will be in the eating. It will be good to see how the US consumer reacts.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The turbulence buffeting global stock markets eased on Monday after positive data from China boosted confidence in the world second biggest economy. China\u2019s power usage, rail freight and property market have all shown improvement since August, indicating that the economy is stabilising, the country\u2019s top economic planning agency said on Monday. The effects of supportive policies, including interest rate cuts, property market stimulus, local government debt swaps, will feed into the economy over the next few months and help underpin growth, the national development and reform commission (NDRC) said on its website. Investors were also hopeful that stock market purchases by government-backed agencies had helped to put a floor under prices. China\u2019s main stock market index, the Shanghai Composite, was in positive territory on Monday despite fears of more selling after trading resumed after a four-day break. The Hang Seng in Hong Kong was up 0.22%, the Nikkei in Japan was also up 0.44% and Korea\u2019s Kospi index was up slightly. A poor outlook for commodity prices and the downgrading of the mining company Rio Tinto sent Australian shares sharply lower but the improved picture from China dragged the S&amp;P/ASX200 upwards to 5,015 points, down only 0.25%. Chris Weston of IG Markets in Melbourne said it was not clear whether the Chinese market had reached a low or not but comments over the weekend by central bank governor Zhou Xiaochuan that the selloff was close to end had helped reassure traders. \u201cOne day doesn\u2019t make a bull market. However, when you hear that power usage, train freight and property markets are showing signs of improvement, domestic traders listen,\u201d he said. A flurry of recent soft indicators \u2013 and a collapse in China\u2019s stock markets \u2013 had heightened fears of a hard landing for the world\u2019s second-biggest economy and sent global financial markets into a tailspin. But the NDRC said: \u201cThe power usage, rail freight, as well as real estate prices and turnover have all improved into August, indicating the economy is stabilising amid fluctuations. \u201cThe economy is expected to maintain steady growth and we are able to achieve annual economic growth target.\u201d The NDRC cited data from the state grid as saying that China\u2019s total power consumption in August rose 2.47% on the year \u2013 the fastest growth so far this year and steady growth was likely to continue in September. The average daily rail freight volume rose 1.6% in August from July, the NDRC said China\u2019s exports are likely to swing into positive growth in August from a 8.3 percent drop in July, the agency said without giving specifics. The customs office is due to release August trade figures on Tuesday. Analysts polled by Reuters expected exports to drop 6.0 percent in August compared with a year earlier. China\u2019s economy, which grew 7% in the first half compared with a year earlier, is headed for its slowest economic expansion in 25 years in 2015. The recent downbeat data, however, has raised the risk the government could miss the full-year growth target. The national bureau of statistics said on Monday that it had revised China\u2019s growth rate for 2014 to 7.3% from the previously released figure of 7.4%.",

      "bodyText": "The UK must tackle its gender pay gap and improve access to education if it is to reduce inequality, according to a new report from the World Economic Forum (WEF) on how governments can foster inclusive growth. The Forum, the body behind the high-powered annual Davos summit, has produced 15 measures of how well countries foster equality as they grow their economies. Its findings on the UK highlight bright spots in business ownership and \u201cprogressive income taxes\u201d. But the country is found wanting in various aspects of education, healthcare and the labour market. \u201cEfforts are required to improve access to education as well as its quality, which would be important for tackling the youth unemployment problem and the low levels of social mobility in the country,\u201d says the Inclusive Growth and Development report. \u201cEquality of health outcomes could be improved, given the significant gaps in adjusted life expectancy. Greater equity in the labour market through stronger participation of women and reduction in the gender pay gap would also foster more inclusive growth,\u201d it adds. Highlighting the relatively high proportion of working parents\u2019 pay going on childcare, the WEF also recommends better access to affordable childcare. The study comes against the backdrop of repeated warnings from policymakers and economists that the fruits of economic expansion must be more evenly shared and that the gap between rich and poor could actually serve to curb growth. The Forum describes its two-year study into the performance of 112 economies as a bid to broaden that debate about inequality beyond merely observing symptoms to instead finding specific ways to change policies and institutions in order to improve living standards. Its benchmarks for countries range from trade union membership to property taxes. \u201cThe report aims to make discussions about inequality less about aspiration and more about concrete action,\u201d says Rick Samans, a member of the WEF board and a former economic adviser to Bill Clinton. The analysis concludes that there is no single example of best practice for tackling inequality, with all countries lacking in some area. But among the 30 advanced economies studied, some stand out as performing better than others overall, notably Nordic countries, Switzerland, Australia and the Netherlands, says Samans, one of the report\u2019s co-authors. The study deliberately avoids an overall league table of equality but instead ranks countries relative to their peers on seven different \u201cpillars\u201d and 15 \u201csub-pillars\u201d. \u201cThere\u2019s been a grand debate over the fact we need a better growth model ... in effect what we are suggesting here is that our mental model of how we generate growth has to use a wider lens,\u201d says Samans. The study ranks the UK in 20th place out of 30 advanced economies for education and skills, in part because of a low score for enrolment in vocational courses. Finland is in first place in the education category followed by the Netherlands and Switzerland. For \u201cemployment and labour compensation\u201d, the UK is also fairly low in the rankings in 18th place, while Norway is top, followed by Denmark. Among the report\u2019s broad conclusions, the authors argue \u201cit is possible to be pro-inclusiveness and pro-growth at the same time.\u201d They also conclude that using the tax system to curb inequality can be helpful \u2013 but so can other policies. \u201cMany economies with high levels of tax and redistribution are highly competitive. However, use of policy space in other areas could reduce the need for these levers,\u201d says the report. The analysis found that fostering social inclusion is not solely a luxury of high-income countries. \u201cIn many sub-pillars \u2013 such as business and political ethics, financial system inclusion, and educational quality and equity \u2013 some developing countries do better than others with much higher incomes.\u201d",
