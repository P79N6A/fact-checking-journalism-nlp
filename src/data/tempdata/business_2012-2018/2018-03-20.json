      "bodyText": "The UK is well on the way to a new era of subsidy-free renewable energy projects that will largely kill off prospects for new gas power stations, according to industry analysts. The falling cost of wind and solar projects combined with advances in battery storage technology will unlock about \u00a320bn of investment in the UK between now and 2030, Aurora Energy Research said. Onshore wind and solar will both be viable without subsidies by 2025 in the UK, it added. The prediction comes as the Swedish energy firm Vattenfall announced that it had won a Dutch government tender to develop a windfarm which will become the world\u2019s first without subsidies when built off the Netherlands coast in 2022. \u201cThe [subsidy-free] future is within reach,\u201d Magnus Hall, Vattenfall\u2019s chief executive, told an industry audience in Oxford. But the switch to a post-subsidy world would still require some financial aid during the transition period, Hall said, to ensure that risk was fairly shared between energy firms and governments. Hall urged ministers to consider reversing the UK\u2019s ban on subsidies for onshore windfarms, saying developers of these projects should be allowed to compete in auctions for subsidies. His call was echoed by two of the UK\u2019s big six energy firms, SSE and ScottishPower. Alistair Phillips-Davies, chief executive of SSE, said onshore windfarms should be given a chance where communities support them. \u201cI\u2019d like to see onshore wind coming back in the UK,\u201d he said. Keith Anderson, chief corporate office at Scottish Power, told the Guardian: \u201cLet\u2019s use it, let\u2019s deploy it. There are still areas absolutely where we could build onshore windfarms, areas where the local community are acceptive of windfarms.\u201d Wind power is expected to account for half of the 18GW of subsidy-free renewables to be built in the UK between now and 2030, according to a new Aurora Energy Research report. The other half will be from solar power, which had largely stalled after subsidy cuts in 2015 but received a boost when the UK\u2019s first subsidy-free solar farm opened last year. Having so much green energy generation will squeeze out the opportunity for the likes of Germany\u2019s RWE to build large gas power stations in the UK. The government has already downgraded the amount of new gas power capacity it expects to be added by 2030 from 22GW to 7GW, but Aurora said that would shrink to just 1GW if subsidy-free renewables took off as anticipated. Mateusz Wronski, an analyst at Aurora, said: \u201cThe subsidy-free revolution is here and it\u2019s big.\u201d Prices in the capacity market, the government\u2019s scheme for guaranteeing power supplies during winter, have repeatedly been too low to encourage new large gas power plants to be built. The energy minister, Claire Perry, announced on Tuesday that the government would be launching a formal review of the capacity market later this year. One consideration will be whether to open up the scheme to renewable energy projects, a step that would further hammer gas. Perry said the cold snap at the start of March, which saw gas demand jump 40% above normal levels, had shown the UK energy system was robust but there are \u201clessons to be learned\u201d.",

      "bodyText": "Time for a quick recap Britain\u2019s cost-of-living crisis has eased a little, after inflation fell back from its recent highs. The consumer prices index fell to 2.7% in February, down from 3% in January, and closer to wage growth. The Office for National Statistics reported that food and fuel inflation slowed, pulling down the benchmark cost of living. But, prices are still rising ahead of earnings - although tomorrow\u2019s labour market statistics may show the gap narrowing. The impact of the pound\u2019s fall after the EU referendum is starting to fade, after driving import prices sharply higher in 2017. Economists are split over whether the Bank of England will raise interest rates in May, as it tries to get inflation back down to 2% without driving up unemployment. Andrew Sentance, senior economic adviser at PwC, has warned that inflation could get an Easter bump, which would hurt households. In the markets, European stock markets are clawing back some ground after Monday\u2019s selloff. But Facebook is being shunned again; its shares down another 3% as politicians and regulators probe how users\u2019 personal data has been used. Despite Facebook\u2019s deepening problems, the US stock market is recovering from Monday\u2019s losses. The Dow Jones industrial average, which shed 335 points yesterday, is up 180 today. The tech-focused Nasdaq is flattish, with software firm Adobe up 2.8% and chipmaker NVIDIA up 1.1%. Facebook, though, is still down 3%. Back on inflation, our economics editor Larry Elliott has warned that the Bank of England could raise interest rates in May - if wages rise over the next couple of months. He writes: Earnings growth has been creeping up and before too long earnings will be increasing more quickly than prices. The sharper than expected fall in inflation means the return to rising real incomes will occur sooner and that will mean stronger growth and \u2013 from the MPC\u2019s perspective \u2013 the threat of higher wage inflation. While there has been little in recent economic data to justify a May increase in rates, earnings data will be crucial. If the annual increase edges closer to 3%, a spring rise will be a real possibility. No sign of a bounceback for Facebook yet: Over in New York, shares in Facebook have fallen by another 3% at the start of trading. That\u2019s on top of yesterday\u2019s 6.7% rout, and knocks another $15bn off its market capitalisation. The selloff comes as the data scandal that hit the company last weekend deepens, with several new developments today: A former Facebook executive has told the Guardian that numerous companies harvested the personal data of its users America\u2019s Federal Trade Commission is reportedly probing whether Facebook violated the terms of a 2011 consent decree over its use of personal data A parliamentary committee has asked Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg to answer questions European stock markets have recovered a little ground this morning, after yesterday\u2019s selloff. In London the FTSE 100 has gained 22 points, having slumped to a 15-month low on Monday. However, worries over global trade spats, the Facebook data crisis and uncertainty over the pace of US interest rate rises are all keeping traders edgy. Elsewhere in the markets, legendary motor racing star-turned-airline manager Niki Lauda has landed a deal with Ryanair. The Irish budget airline has agreed to buy a 25% stake in Laudamotion - the Vienna-based operator which was created out of Laudi\u2019s previous airline, Niki (formerly part of Air Berlin, which went bust last year). Ryanair intends to boost its state to 75% as soon as EU regulators have given their approval. It will lend Laudamotion six planes, which will boost its fleet to 21 -- helping it to challenge rival Lufthansa. Jane Foley, head of foreign exchange strategy at Rabobank, believes the Bank of England\u2019s monetary policy committee will raise interest rates at least once this year. And despite today\u2019s inflation figures, she believes they will hike Bank Rate from 0.5% to 0.75% in May. \u201cOur expectation is of no change to rates at this week\u2019s BoE meeting] but of a rise at the May meeting. In our view, though, the market is still focusing too much on the committee\u2019s voting patterns. It is possible for every member to hold steady this time while also planning to vote for a hike in May. \u201cThe markets are better served by reading the Bank\u2019s minutes closely and observing Mark Carney\u2019s comments. It was clear at Davos, for example, that he was readying the markets for a potential rate increase during the first half of the year. \u201cIn terms of a November hike, there remain two core issues at play. The first is Brexit. If the process runs smoothly, the environment will be much more conducive to a rate rise. Secondly, the Bank will monitor UK wage growth closely. If this increases, pushing up inflation, it will be a lot easier to justify a rate hike. \u201cThese are significant factors, though, and so it is possible to envisage a rate rise in May but none later in the year if Brexit negotiations hit a snag and wages are flat.\u201d The pound has dipped slightly, following the news that Britain\u2019s consumer prices index has dropped to a seven-month low. Traders are calculating that the inflation slowdown makes a UK interest rate rise a little less likely in the next few months. But sterling is only down 0.1% against the US dollar today, to just over $1.40 (this tweet from Bloomberg makes it look more dramatic though!) The muted reaction suggests the City believes a May rate hike is still possible. Obviously the Bank of England will be pleased to see inflation falling towards its target of 2%. But if wages do pick up, policymakers might conclude that labour market slack has been eroded, so the economy can handle higher borrowing costs. Thursday\u2019s meeting is an opportunity for the BoE to drop some hints... Households won\u2019t be popping champagne bottles open when wages finally start rising faster than inflation. Economist Rupert Seggins has shown how workers\u2019 earnings power has been badly eroded since the financial crisis, meaning people are poorer in real terms: In other news, the threat of a global trade war has hit investor confidence in Germany: House price inflation also fell last month, but is still rising faster than wages. The average house price rose by 4.9% in the 12 months to January, down from 5% a month earlier. Prices rose slowest in the North East (0.7%) and London (2.1%), but jumped fastest in the East Midlands (7.3). It\u2019s possible that wages will catch up with inflation this month, predicts Stephen Clarke, senior economic analyst at the Resolution Foundation. \u201cImport-driven inflation is clearly slowing. Food and beverage prices are rising at a slower rate than last month and further falls are likely. We can also see a slowdown in transport inflation, contributing just 0.35 ppts to annual inflation down from 0.8ppts a year ago, and the price of utilities is rising at a slower rate than before. Both are underpinned by a fall in the price of energy from its New Year highs. \u201cThe sharp fall in inflation means we could be seeing an earlier end to the pay squeeze than previously expected, perhaps as early as this month\u201d We get the latest UK earnings figures tomorrow, in the unemployment data for November-January. Economists predict that wages rose by 2.6% per year in that quarter, which would almost eliminate the gap. Mel Stride, financial secretary to the Treasury, insists that the government is helping families cope with inflation. He says: \u201cWe know families feel the cost of living at the end of every working week. From next month a typical taxpayer will pay 1,000 less income tax than in 2010. \u201cAnd we are increasing the National Living Wage, which is already helping the lowest earners see their pay rise by almost 7% above inflation. This is part of our plan to build an economy that works for everyone.\u201d Stride also suggests that real wages should start rising again soon, as inflation is expected to keep dropping: Unions aren\u2019t impressed, though. TUC general secretary Frances O\u2019Grady warns that workers desperately need a proper pay rise after years of struggles: She says: \u201cBritain\u2019s living standards crisis is far from over. Today\u2019s fall in prices may ease the pressure a bit. But working people will still be worse off at the end of this parliament than before the crash. \u201cThe government must up its game. Millions of workers haven\u2019t had a proper pay rise in years. \u201cUnless ministers invest in the infrastructure and public services needed for better-paid jobs, the UK will remain at the bottom of the league for real wage growth.\u201d It\u2019s now 14 months since the pound hit a 31-year low against the US dollar at $1.20, driving import prices higher. Sterling has since recovered to around $1,40. Phil Gooding, head of CPI at the Office for National Statistics, believes the impact of the pound\u2019s slide is now fading: \u201cA small fall in petrol prices alongside food prices rising more slowly than last year helped pull down inflation, as many of the early 2017 price increases due to the previous depreciation of the pound have started to work through the system. \u201cHotel prices also fell and the cost of ferry tickets rose more slowly than last year, when prices were collected on Valentine\u2019s Day when many people could have been taking mini-breaks.\u201d The battle against inflation isn\u2019t over, warns Andrew Sentance, senior economic adviser at PwC. He predicts that consumer prices could push higher this month, as retailers and transport firms prepare for Easter: \u201cIt is not a surprise to see UK inflations tarting to fall back - from 3% in January to 2.7% in February. Forecasters were expecting price increases to ease back this year. But the rate of reduction is likely to remain slow and volatile. The fact that Easter is early this year could push inflation back up again in March. Sentance (a former Bank of England policymaker) also argues that UK interest rates could soon rise - even though inflationary pressures are easing. The UK recovery is now nearly nine years old, and yet our official interest rate is exactly where it was nine years ago. A further interest rate rise would be justified this Spring - which would show that the UK is following the lead of the US Federal Reserve in embarking on a policy of gradual and careful interest rate rises.\u201d This slowdown in inflation should bring some relief to poorer families, says Richard Lim of Retail Economics: \u201cKey areas driving the decline included transport and food which comprise a large chunk of expenditure, especially for the least affluent households. \u201cWhile real earnings remain in negative territory, the financial pinch will continue to ease and we expect growth to resurface by mid-2018.\u201d Jeremy Cook, chief economist at WorldFirst, predicts that UK pay rises could overtake inflation soon: \u201cFollowing the decision by the ONS to exclude pork pies and nightclub bottled lagers from the inflation basket, we will soon get to a point wherein the declines the pound suffered following the EU referendum go a similar way. CPI at 2.7% is the lowest since July of last year and while wages are hardly setting the world alight, we could be within a few months of real wages turning positive for the first time since the beginning of last year.\u201d British inflation seems to be falling back from its recent peak, says Suren Thiru of the British Chambers of Commerce: Economist Simon French of Panmure Gordon agrees that import price inflation is cooling. The BBC\u2019s Kamal Ahmed is optimistic that real wages will start rising soon. More detail: Petrol prices fell by 0.2 pence per litre between January and February, to 120.8 pence per litre in February. Food and non-alcoholic beverages prices rose by 0.1% between January and February this year compared with a rise of 0.8% a year ago. This drop in inflation suggests that the impact of the Brexit vote is finally fading. Transport and food has the biggest downward impact on inflation, according to the Office for National Statistics. It says: The largest downward contributions to the change in the rate came from transport and food prices, which rose by less than a year ago. Falling prices for accommodation services also had a downward effect. Rising prices for footwear produced the largest, partially offsetting, upward contribution. In recent months, import costs had been pushed by drop in sterling after the EU referendum in June 2016. That impact may now be easing. Breaking! UK inflation has fallen to its lowest since last July. The consumer prices index has fallen to 2.7% in February, from 3% in January, taking some pressure off hard-pressed households. It suggests that the squeeze in earnings is coming to an end, as wages rose by 2.8% per year in December (although by 2.5% in the October-December quarter). More to follow! Real wages in the UK have been falling since last spring, so the end of the cost of living squeeze can\u2019t come soon enough. New data from Barclaycard shows that 39% of people feel poorer than a year ago, due to rising inflation. Food and fuel prices are a key factor. Here\u2019s some details: two-thirds (67 per cent) say it is because their weekly shop seems more expensive than it used to be 41 per cent say filling up the car seems more expensive than it used to A fifth (21 per cent) say the cost of a night out or meal in a restaurant seems more expensive than it used to One in five (20 per cent) say that the cost of travelling on public transport has gone up Economist Sam Tombs predicts that today\u2019s inflation data will cut the chances that the Bank of England raises interest rates this spring. Just in: Europe\u2019s trade commissioner, Cecilia Malmstr\u00f6m, is jetting to America to insist that the EU is excluded from the new tariffs on steel and aluminium imports. Malmstr\u00f6m, who has already threatened retaliatory action on American products, will meet with commerce secretary Wilbur Ross. However, US officials have already warned that president Trump will make the final decision, with a rather broad-brush approach: Economist Rupert Seggins is tweeting some handy charts about inflation: Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Britain\u2019s inflation is in the spotlight today, and for the first time in months we might get some good news. Economists predict that the consumer prices index fell in February, from January\u2019s 3% to around 2.8% last month. If so, that would ease some of the pressure suffered by households since the pound slumped after the Brexit vote. The data is released at 9.30am - here\u2019s the situation last month: A fall in inflation would offer hopes that the cost of living squeeze might be ending. Wages rose by 2.5% per year in the last quarter, and by 2.8% in December alone. If that trend continues, it\u2019s possible that real wages might actually turn positive soon. Weaker inflation also takes some pressure off the Bank of England to raise interest rates, so today\u2019s report could move sterling. Konstantinos Anthis, head of research at ADS Securities, says: The British pound will be front and centre this morning in light of the release of the UK inflation report. The Consumer Price Index is the number one concern for the Bank of England as the rallying inflation has forced the British central bank to grow more hawkish and signal three rate hikes over the next three years. Today\u2019s report will be important in assessing when the first hike for this year will come. The Bank of England will set interest rates on Thursday (we\u2019re not expecting a hike, though). The ONS will also release its latest UK house price data (for January). Also coming up today.... The technology sector is reeling after Facebook was engulfed in the Cambridge Analytica data scandal. Last night, around $36bn was wiped off Facebook\u2019s value, knocking $5.5bn off Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s personal wealth, as politicians demanded to know how the personal details of 50m Facebook users were harvested. As public anger mounts, Zuckerberg has been keeping a remarkably low profile. Parliament, though, wants answers. Conservative MP Damian Collins, chair of the digital, culture, media and sport select committee declared: \u201cIt\u2019s time for Mark Zuckerberg to stop hiding behind his Facebook page.\u201d Jasper Lawler of CMC Markets says investors have serious concerns: This is not the first time that Facebook have been caught being lax over their controls; both users and regulators are going to want this to be the last or at least see the firm go to extraordinary lengths to prevent incidences like this happening again. The next few weeks will be crucial as to how Facebook responds to the allegation. With Uber suspending its driverless-car testing after one of its vehicles hit and killed a woman in Arizona, big tech is under more scrutiny than ever. City traders will also be watching for the latest economic confidence figures from Germany, and consumer confidence across the eurozone. And in parliament, MPs will be quizzing top officials from Office of Budget Responsibility over last week\u2019s spring statement. including chairman Robert Chote. The agenda: 9.30am GMT: UK consumer price inflation data for February released 9.30am GMT: UK house price data for January 10am GMT: ZEW index of German investor confidence 10am GMT: OBR officials questioned by the Treasury committee 3pm GMT: Eurozone consumer confidence figures",

      "bodyText": "Inflation is coming down more quickly than the Bank of England expected as the impact of the post-EU referendum fall in the value of sterling washes out of the system. That was the good news from official data showing that the government\u2019s preferred measure of the annual increase in the cost of living dropped from 3% in January to 2.7% in February. The bad news for homeowners worried about having to pay more to service their mortgages is that the easing of inflationary pressure may not influence the Bank\u2019s monetary policy committee\u2019s decision all that much. The Bank still wants to raise rates and could do so as soon as May. Threadneedle Street always thought the Brexit-influenced spike in inflation was likely to prove temporary. Sterling fell on the foreign exchanges after the Brexit vote in June 2016 and over the next year dearer imports led to the CPI measure of inflation rising from 0.5% to 2.6%. In the second half of 2017, inflation briefly topped 3%. But the annual inflation rate assesses what has been happening to prices over the latest 12-month period and as a new month comes in an old month drops out. The months that are now dropping out \u2013 in early 2017 \u2013 were when the effects of a weaker pound were most marked. Of more concern to the Bank is the state of the labour market. It believes an unemployment rate of 4.4% \u2013 only marginally above its lowest since the mid-1970s \u2013 is starting to put upward pressure on wages. Earnings growth has been creeping up and before too long earnings will be increasing more quickly than prices. The sharper than expected fall in inflation means the return to rising real incomes will occur sooner and that will mean stronger growth and \u2013 from the MPC\u2019s perspective \u2013 the threat of higher wage inflation. While there has been little in recent economic data to justify a May increase in rates, earnings data will be crucial. If the annual increase edges closer to 3%, a spring rise will be a real possibility.",

In the second half of 2017, inflation briefly topped 3%.</p> \n<p>But the annual inflation rate assesses what has been happening to prices over the latest 12-month period and as a new month comes in an old month drops out.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Inflation fell further than expected last month, as the impact of the Brexit vote on the price of petrol and food began to fade, easing the pressure on squeezed British households. The consumer price index (CPI) fell to 2.7% in February, down from 3% in January, according to the Office for National Statistics. Economists had expected a CPI of 2.8%. The new reading puts the barometer for the cost of living in Britain at its lowest level since July last year. Phil Gooding from the ONS said a small fall in petrol prices alongside a slower rise in food prices than last year helped to pull down inflation: \u201cMany of the early 2017 price increases due to the previous depreciation of the pound have started to work through the system.\u201d The pound plunged immediately after the leave vote, driving-up the cost of importing fuel and food to Britain and putting intense pressure on household finances. Consumer spending has fallen as a consequence, while average wage growth has failed to beat inflation since the middle of last year. . The faster than expected decline in the rate of inflation will please the UK chancellor, Philip Hammond, as it brings closer the point at which real wage growth should return for British workers. The ONS will deliver an update on workers\u2019 pay and the country\u2019s latest employment figures on Wednesday. The ONS pointed to falling hotel prices and the cost of buying ferry tickets rising more slowly than a year ago. The price of seasonal produce such as fresh vegetables also rose by much less than a year ago, when flooding and storms in the Mediterranean led to a poor harvest. Although wage growth is unlikely to rise above inflation just yet, the chancellor told MPs at the spring statement last week that he expected inflation would fall back to the government\u2019s target rate of 2% and that pay would rise at a faster rate within the next 12 months. The financial secretary to the Treasury, Mel Stride, said the government was cutting taxes and raising the minimum wage for the lowest earners. \u201cThis is part of our plan to build an economy that works for everyone.\u201d Despite the promise of rising wages, some economists expect average earnings will remain below their pre-financial crisis peak until at least the middle of the next decade, making the post-crash era one of the worst periods for pay growth since the Napoleonic wars. Labour said the latest figures showed workers were still struggling with real earnings lower than when the Tories first came to power in 2010. Peter Dowd, shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, said the spring statement was a \u201cmissed opportunity that exposed Philip Hammond\u2019s complacency, as it contained no new measures to deal with this rising burden faced by many working families\u201d. However, the bigger-than-expected fall in price growth could undermine the Bank of England\u2019s arguments for raising interest rates from as early as May. Mark Carney, the Bank\u2019s governor, has suggested rising global oil prices and an upswing in the world economy could offset the fading impact of the Brexit vote, which could force Threadneedle Street to act. The Bank\u2019s monetary policy committee, which could provide a hint for a May rate hike at its next meeting on Thursday, will also be watching for greater evidence of wage growth to support its case for raising the cost of borrowing. Economists expect pay to rise this year amid the lowest levels of unemployment since the mid 1970s, which should help to increase their bargaining power to demand higher wages. James Smith, an economist at ING Bank, said: \u201cOn the face of it, [the latest inflation reading] takes some of the pressure off the Bank of England to hike rates again in the near-term. However, policymakers are increasingly focusing on wage growth, which has been showing signs of life recently.\u201d",
