    "webTitle": "Eurozone crisis: Merkel tells Athens and Paris to stick to spending limits", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Europe's 30-month effort to save the euro by slashing spending and debt levels risks turning into a crisis of political legitimacy after EU leaders' strategies collided spectacularly with the wishes of voters in Greece and France. The impasse was most graphically demonstrated when Germany's chancellor, Angela Merkel, insisted Athens must comply with the stringent terms of its \u20ac130bn (\u00a3100bn) bailout even though more than 60% of the Greek electorate had voted for parties rejecting those terms. Following a French election campaign in which she strongly backed the loser, Nicolas Sarkozy, and snubbed the president-elect, Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, Merkel stressed her opposition to Hollande's central campaign pledge: reopening the euro's new rulebook, or fiscal pact. \"That's just not on,\" she told a Berlin press conference called to address the huge shift from right to left in France. The first attempt to cobble together a new Greek government collapsed quickly when Antonis Samaras, the centre-right leader, called off negotiations. Greece appears to be on the brink of ungovernability as a result of a messy election triggered by the euro crisis. The stock market suffered its worse fall since 2008, losing as much as 8% of its value before closing 6.7% down. The country's banking index was 13% lower. Market analysts shortened the odds against the country's chances of surviving in the single currency. \"The irresistible force of German austerity has clashed with the immovable object of Greek popular resistance,\" said Tristan Cooper, sovereign debt analyst at Fidelity Worldwide Investment. \"The eurozone's weakest link just got weaker. Although it should be no surprise that Greeks are spurning the bitter medicine, the violence of the rejection is a shock. A Greek eurozone exit is now firmly on the cards.\" But Klaus Regling, the German head of the eurozone's temporary bailout fund, warned that a return to the drachma would \"be a catastrophe for Greece\". In an election that saw the most spectacular collapse of big established parties in modern European democracy, the centre-right New Democracy and the centre-left Pasok mustered just over 30% of the vote between them, compared with almost 80% three years ago. Samaras, the New Democracy leader, said he had \"returned the mandate\", abandoning the attempt to construct a parliamentary majority. \"We did whatever was possible,\" he said. The big winner, Syriza, a coalition of leftist radicals that came second, squarely blamed Merkel for the mess. \"European leaders and especially Merkel have to understand that austerity policies have suffered defeat,\" said its young leader, Alexis Tsipras. After two years of prescribing austerity as the cure for the debt disease and establishing the legal instruments to entrench it, EU leaders have now switched to talking of growth strategies. They speak of the merits of growth, but are split on how to achieve it. Both centrist leaders in Athens, Antonis Samaras of New Democracy and Evangelos Venizelos of Pasok, called for the bailout terms to be renegotiated, putting the commission, the International Monetary Fund, and the European Central Bank on the spot. \"We've said over and over that Greece should stay in the euro. But everyone has to carry their responsibilities. Solidarity is a two-way street,\" said Amadeu Altafaj, spokesman for Olli Rehn, the euro commissioner. \"Timely implementation of the programme is of the essence.\" That appears a tall order, though, with Greece apparently condemned to weeks or months of instability and the possibility of having to stage yet another election. Merkel has her own electoral problems. After losing a regional state election on Sunday and facing a sterner test next weekend in the key state of North-Rhine Westfalia, she stuck to her hard line on fiscal rigouron Monday. But she was also generous towards Hollande, saying she would welcome him to Berlin \"with open arms\". Hollande, who has never met Merkel, has said he will go to Berlin the day after he is sworn in, scheduled for next Tuesday. With European politics flirting with meltdown as incumbent leaders are felled, the renewed air of emergency is generating heated language from senior figures, mainly directed at Merkel. On Monday the former president of Latvia, Vaira Vike-Freiberga, argued that the EU was becoming both dominated and neglected by Germany. \"Is the Europe that is emerging from the euro crisis a German one? During the euro crisis, power in the EU seems to have shifted towards one national capital in particular, Berlin,\" she wrote in Warsaw's Gazeta Wyborcza, together with Portugal's former European commissioner Antonio Vitorino. \"Germany, it seems, is becoming a 'geo-economic power' driven by the needs of its export sector. By using economic means to pursue its foreign-policy ends, Germany is gradually turning its back on its European partners.\" The anti-German sentiment, which has Berlin worried, is echoed in a cri de coeur from Greece's outgoing development minister and former European Commissioner, Anna Diamantopoulou, to Jacques Delors and Romano Prodi, two former commission heads, couched as an \"SOS\" to save Europe. Her letter, leaked to the Guardian, argues passionately that the austerity gripping Europe has reduced the union to quasi-wartime conditions. \"It is like a war when a country loses 20% of its GDP in 18 months. It is like a war when we have the reappearance of rations in European capitals. It is like a war when millions of young people, the best and the brightest, leave their countries behind,\" she wrote. \"Greece, Italy, Spain, Portugal, Ireland and even France are in the midst of a forest fire which is spreading alarmingly fast. The belief that such a fire can be stopped at national borders is misjudged. The European Council has been shrunk by the authority of its financial powerhouse, Germany.\"",

    "webTitle": "Wonga launches business loans service", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The high-cost lender Wonga is launching a business loans service, promising to make funds available within 15 minutes of an application. Wonga was reluctant to quote a typical annual percentage rate, or APR, for loans, saying the measure was inappropriate as they could be taken out for as little as a week. The firm has been heavily criticised for lending to individuals at an APR of 4,214%, but claims business loans will be at rates starting at 17% APR. Loans of \u00a33,000 to \u00a310,000 will be available for terms of between one and 52 weeks. The cost, including a variable application fee and interest, starts at 0.3% a week and the loans must be repaid in weekly instalments. Wonga is entering the business loan market at a time when firms are struggling to raise funding. Research in November by the Federation of Small Businesses showed that 57% of firms suffered late payment by clients but between 2007 and 2010 there was a 24% fall in successful loan applications. More than half of small firms that applied for an overdraft and 43% applying for a loan for the first time last year were rejected. The shadow business secretary, Chuka Umunna, criticised the government for failing to get banks to lend more to small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). \"That SMEs are being driven into the hands of Wonga is a damning indictment of the government's failure to get finance to successful SMEs,\" he said. Anil Stocker, founder of the online financing firm MarketInvoice, expressed dismay at Wonga's entry into the market. \"We were shocked when figures from the Small Business Finance Monitor appeared suggesting as many as 26% of businesses were funding their working-capital needs from credit cards. Turning to Wonga-style, extremely expensive loans would be even more irresponsible,\" he said. In contrast, Funding Circle provides monthly repayment loans ranging from \u00a35,000 to \u00a3250,000 \"in a matter of days, not months\" and charges from 6.4% annually. The loans, which are funded directly by investors rather than through a bank, are repayable over one, three or five years. Royal Bank of Scotland said its average rate was 2.9% last year and it approved 90% of SME loans. \"We aim to approve loans as quickly as possible, and this could be as soon as the same day if we have the necessary supporting information,\" said a spokeswoman. Wonga said its short-term loans were different from those provided by banks, and were expected to sit alongside traditional bank overdrafts, bank loans and invoice discounting products, providing alternative or additional funding. Russell Gould, head of Wonga for business, said: \"The product is targeted at businesses which have cash coming in every week, rather than two or three times a year.\" Wonga's service will initially be available to limited liability companies and limited liability partnerships that have been established for three years or more and have sales in excess of \u00a320,000 a month, and Wonga said it expected to broaden the application criteria and the loan parameters over time. Errol Damelin, Wonga's founder and chief executive, said the company was trying to fill a gap in the funding market. \"Young, entrepreneurial companies represent our best hope of a recovery, yet many are struggling because they can't get quick access to the credit that they need to cope with everyday challenges, such as late payment by partners or customers. \"Others can use funds for great opportunities like getting a discount by paying cash, or buying in bulk, and then repaying early when the goods are sold,\" he said. Wonga said a clear cost of repayment would be calculated for approved applicants before they committed. In one example it provided, a firm is lent \u00a37,500 for 16 weeks, paying \u00a3360 in interest, equivalent to 0.3% a week, and an application fee of \u00a375, or 1%. The weekly repayments are \u00a3495.94, with a total repayable of \u00a37,935. A company that is deemed more risky will pay more. If it borrows \u00a36,000 for 12 weeks, with interest at 0.8% a week and a \u00a3120 application fee, the weekly repayment is \u00a3558 and the total repayable is \u00a36,696, it said.",

Russell Gould, head of Wonga for business, said: \"The product is targeted at businesses which have cash coming in every week, rather than two or three times a year.\"</p> <p>Wonga's service will initially be available to limited liability companies and limited liability partnerships that have been established for three years or more and have sales in excess of \u00a320,000 a month, and Wonga said it expected to broaden the application criteria and the loan parameters over time.</p> <p>Errol Damelin, Wonga's founder and chief executive, said the company was trying to fill a gap in the funding market. \"Young, entrepreneurial companies represent our best hope of a recovery, yet many are struggling because they can't get quick access to the credit that they need to cope with everyday challenges, such as late payment by partners or customers.</p> <p>\"Others can use funds for great opportunities like getting a discount by paying cash, or buying in bulk, and then repaying early when the goods are sold,\" he said.</p> <p>Wonga said a clear cost of repayment would be calculated for approved applicants before they committed. In one example it provided, a firm is lent \u00a37,500 for 16 weeks, paying \u00a3360 in interest, equivalent to 0.3% a week, and an application fee of \u00a375, or 1%. The weekly repayments are \u00a3495.94, with a total repayable of \u00a37,935.</p> <p>A company that is deemed more risky will pay more. If it borrows \u00a36,000 for 12 weeks, with interest at 0.8% a week and a \u00a3120 application fee, the weekly repayment is \u00a3558 and the total repayable is \u00a36,696, it said.</p>",

Last November Angel Gurria, general-secretary of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, the body whose job is to oversee the crackdown, told the G20 in Cannes: \"The era of bank secrecy is over.\" Acknowledging work remained to be done in some areas, he nevertheless insisted: \"It is now no longer possible to hide assets or income without risking detection.\"</p> <p>Presented with Johannesen and Zucman's findings last week, Pascal Saint-Amans, the OECD's head of tax, said: \"It's an interesting survey, but perhaps it is published a bit early. Let's see what the impact is in a couple of years.\"</p> <p>However, tax campaigners claim the latest study shows getting offshore centres to sign bilateral co-operation treaties is an ineffective means of tackling the problem. Weakly worded treaties, they argue, allow signatories to request financial details only where they can already demonstrate suspect evasion activity. Reformers have called for more robust transparency treaties to weed out tax evaders.</p> <p>Adding to the challenge facing tax authorities is the widespread use of corporate structures spanning multiple havens. Johannesen and Zucman's study found that some $550bn \u2013 about a quarter of all deposits in tax havens \u2013 was owned by individuals or companies in other havens. The British Virgin Islands and Panama are popular jurisdictions for such holding companies.</p> <p>Money flowing to opaque offshore financial centres has in recent years been the subject of intense political scrutiny as many of the world's largest economies \u2013 not least the US and Britain \u2013 have been straining to raise sufficient taxes to pay for public services and to service rising debts without choking off economic growth.</p> <p>The G20 crackdown has pressured many offshore financial centres to sign co-operation treaties. Jersey and Guernsey have signed 18 and 19 such treaties respectively. According to Johannesen and Zucman, BIS data suggests that these bilateral treaties typically lead to a 3.8% fall in the deposits held on behalf of individuals or companies from the treaty partner.</p> <p>Bank deposits in Jersey have dropped by more than a half, a fall of $110bn over four years; deposits in Guernsey have declined by 15%. By contrast, Johannesen and Zucman said, Cyprus has signed only two co-operation treaties meeting OECD criteria and saw deposit levels rise by 60%.</p> <p>\"The deposit gains and losses correlate strongly with the number of treaties signed by each haven,\" the academics found. \"The least compliant havens have attracted new clients, while the most compliant have lost some, leaving roughly unchanged the total amount of wealth managed in tax havens.\"</p> <p>However, they also noted that those withdrawing deposits around the time of co-operation treaties \u2013 possible tax evaders \u2013 were frequently shifting their wealth to other, similarly secretive, offshore centres where no such equivalent treaty existed.</p>",

Despite unprecedented action from political leaders, and a blizzard of bilateral co-operation treaties entered into by offshore centres, deposit data from the Bank of International Settlements (BIS) shows bank accounts in tax havens still held $2.7tn (\u00a31.7tn) last year \u2013 about the same amount as in 2007. Niels Johannesen and Gabriel Zucman, academics who were granted access to a rarely seen breakdown of BIS data, concluded: \"So far, the G20 tax haven crackdown has \u2026 largely failed \u2026 Treaties have led to a modest relocation of bank deposits between tax havens but have not triggered significant flows of funds out of tax havens.\" Their findings are in sharp contrast to the official verdict on the G20 initiative in London in 2009. Last November Angel Gurria, general-secretary of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, the body whose job is to oversee the crackdown, told the G20 in Cannes: \"The era of bank secrecy is over.\" Acknowledging work remained to be done in some areas, he nevertheless insisted: \"It is now no longer possible to hide assets or income without risking detection.\" Presented with Johannesen and Zucman's findings last week, Pascal Saint-Amans, the OECD's head of tax, said: \"It's an interesting survey, but perhaps it is published a bit early. Let's see what the impact is in a couple of years.\" However, tax campaigners claim the latest study shows getting offshore centres to sign bilateral co-operation treaties is an ineffective means of tackling the problem. Weakly worded treaties, they argue, allow signatories to request financial details only where they can already demonstrate suspect evasion activity. Reformers have called for more robust transparency treaties to weed out tax evaders. Adding to the challenge facing tax authorities is the widespread use of corporate structures spanning multiple havens. Johannesen and Zucman's study found that some $550bn \u2013 about a quarter of all deposits in tax havens \u2013 was owned by individuals or companies in other havens. The British Virgin Islands and Panama are popular jurisdictions for such holding companies. Money flowing to opaque offshore financial centres has in recent years been the subject of intense political scrutiny as many of the world's largest economies \u2013 not least the US and Britain \u2013 have been straining to raise sufficient taxes to pay for public services and to service rising debts without choking off economic growth. The G20 crackdown has pressured many offshore financial centres to sign co-operation treaties. Jersey and Guernsey have signed 18 and 19 such treaties respectively. According to Johannesen and Zucman, BIS data suggests that these bilateral treaties typically lead to a 3.8% fall in the deposits held on behalf of individuals or companies from the treaty partner. Bank deposits in Jersey have dropped by more than a half, a fall of $110bn over four years; deposits in Guernsey have declined by 15%. By contrast, Johannesen and Zucman said, Cyprus has signed only two co-operation treaties meeting OECD criteria and saw deposit levels rise by 60%. \"The deposit gains and losses correlate strongly with the number of treaties signed by each haven,\" the academics found. \"The least compliant havens have attracted new clients, while the most compliant have lost some, leaving roughly unchanged the total amount of wealth managed in tax havens.\" However, they also noted that those withdrawing deposits around the time of co-operation treaties \u2013 possible tax evaders \u2013 were frequently shifting their wealth to other, similarly secretive, offshore centres where no such equivalent treaty existed.",

      "bodyText": "The biggest question mark over Facebook as an investment \u2013 at least at a price valuing the company at $77bn to $96bn \u2013 was raised by Sir Martin Sorrell, chief executive of the advertising giant WPP, who warned: \"You interrupt social conversations at your peril.\" It's a critical point. Facebook is undoubtedly a social and conversational phenomenon \u2013 900 million monthly users, 526 million daily users, 3.2bn likes and comments a day in the first quarter of this year \u2013 but, as the IPO roadshow begins, how hard can this population be milked for advertising revenues before users decide corporate messages are a turnoff? There's no easy answer. The letter from founder Mark Zuckerberg to potential investors in the flotation prospectus describes a happy place where \"as people share more, they have access to more opinions from the people they trust about the products and services they use\". That sounds harmless enough, but the proposition being sold to advertisers carries a harder edge: \"Advertisers can specify that we show their ads to a subset of our users based on demographic factors and specific interests that they have chosen to share with us on Facebook or by using the Like button around the web.\" In other words, the information users provide to Facebook will be dissected for the benefit of advertisers. Most users will be prepared to accept this arrangement up to a point, since Facebook costs nothing to use and most people understand there's no such thing as an entirely free lunch. Some users may even welcome receiving targeted advertising, but common sense suggests goodwill towards an advertising-heavy Facebook will not be boundless. The line between popular social service and vulgar commercial medium could turn out to be thin. Don't forget these are still early days: Facebook is only seven years old. That should also be a reminder that tastes and technology change quickly in the digital age. Facebook already finds itself working overtime to make its service more friendly for smartphones. And Google, a larger online monster, is trying to grab a slice of the action in social networking. Whizzkid teenage programmers who dream of being the next Zuckerberg will have their own visions of alternative networks. In the end, one has to look at the numbers to weigh the risks versus potential rewards. Operating profits of $1.7bn were generated on revenues of $3.7bn last year. The implied profit margin is spectacular, but to justify a valuation of about $90bn you probably have to believe that top-line profits (ie, before taxes) can double, double again in short order and then keep on rising. That would be going some. Already there are signs that growth rates could be erratic. Revenues and profits were both lower in the first three months of this year than in the final three months of 2011. Advertisers' desire to spend heavily in the runup to Christmas was the main (plausible) explanation, but it could be that Facebook is already close to satisfying demand in established markets such as North America. Consider, too, the reason why Facebook is floating. It is not because the company needs new capital; it's generating plenty. Instead, as Zuckerberg puts it: \"We're going public for our employees and our investors. We made a commitment to them when gave them equity that we'd work hard to make it worth a lot and make it liquid, and this IPO is fulfilling our commitment.\" Full marks for honesty, but outsiders should pause for thought before enriching the insiders. Will the act of flotation dilute Facebook's entrepreneurial character as programmers contemplate the worth of shares that can be turned into cash?
