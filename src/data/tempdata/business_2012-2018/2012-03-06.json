      "body": "<p><strong> </strong></p> <p>Britain's biggest property manager Peverel Group has been rescued from administration by two private equity companies in a \u00a362m deal that saves 4,200 jobs and severs Peverel's ties with the Vincent Tchenguiz property empire. It ends 12 months of uncertainty for thousands of tenants in retirement homes and residential blocks managed by Peverel.</p> <p>Chamonix Private Equity and Electra Partners have bought <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/2011/mar/19/peverel-tchenguiz-property\" title=\"\">Peverel, whose holding companies collapsed into administration a year ago</a> after property tycoon Tchenguiz ran up debts of \u00a3125m. All 4,200 employees will stay on, after Peverel traded profitably during its year in administration with Zolfo Cooper.</p> <p>Peverel manages 59,000 retirement flats in 1,300 developments, including many McCarthy &amp; Stone retirement homes, as well as 132,000 leasehold apartments in residential blocks. Tenants have accused the company of charging excessive fees and giving a poor service.</p> <p>Chamonix and Electra have appointed Janet Entwistle, previously the managing director of BT Fleet, as chief executive of Peverel and Paul Lester, the former chief executive of VT Group, as chairman. Entwistle said her background working in service businesses would help. \"I've swapped vehicles for properties,\" she said.</p> <p>She admitted that there were serious issues that she would need to address. Last year a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/2011/feb/12/peverel-property-management-tenant-rebellion\" title=\"\">Guardian Money investigation highlighted a catalogue of accusations</a> \u2013 denied by Peverel \u2013 regarding rising service charges, maintenance failures, broken promises, excessive insurance costs and high exit fees from retirement homes. \"There are clearly a lot of concerns that people have and we will talk to them; we want to have a reputation for having excellent customer service,\" said Entwistle. \"There clearly are some industry-wide issues that are of concern, and potentially some structural issues in the sector.\"</p> <p>Crucially, she said, Peverel's debt has been slashed from \u00a3125m to just \u00a325m. The debt was owed to Bank of America Merrill Lynch, which gets about \u00a360m net sale proceeds. The new debt financing of \u00a325m is being provided by Royal Bank of Scotland. Peverel had an \"inappropriate capital structure \u2013 that debt burden led to it being in administration,\" said Entwistle.</p> <p>Tchenguiz bought Peverel in 2007 with financial backing from Merrill Lynch, now part of Bank of America. Peverel's collapse came just days after he was arrested as part of a Serious Fraud Office investigation into the failure of Iceland's Kaupthing bank.

      "bodyText": "Britain's biggest property manager Peverel Group has been rescued from administration by two private equity companies in a \u00a362m deal that saves 4,200 jobs and severs Peverel's ties with the Vincent Tchenguiz property empire. It ends 12 months of uncertainty for thousands of tenants in retirement homes and residential blocks managed by Peverel. Chamonix Private Equity and Electra Partners have bought Peverel, whose holding companies collapsed into administration a year ago after property tycoon Tchenguiz ran up debts of \u00a3125m. All 4,200 employees will stay on, after Peverel traded profitably during its year in administration with Zolfo Cooper. Peverel manages 59,000 retirement flats in 1,300 developments, including many McCarthy &amp; Stone retirement homes, as well as 132,000 leasehold apartments in residential blocks. Tenants have accused the company of charging excessive fees and giving a poor service. Chamonix and Electra have appointed Janet Entwistle, previously the managing director of BT Fleet, as chief executive of Peverel and Paul Lester, the former chief executive of VT Group, as chairman. Entwistle said her background working in service businesses would help. \"I've swapped vehicles for properties,\" she said. She admitted that there were serious issues that she would need to address. Last year a Guardian Money investigation highlighted a catalogue of accusations \u2013 denied by Peverel \u2013 regarding rising service charges, maintenance failures, broken promises, excessive insurance costs and high exit fees from retirement homes. \"There are clearly a lot of concerns that people have and we will talk to them; we want to have a reputation for having excellent customer service,\" said Entwistle. \"There clearly are some industry-wide issues that are of concern, and potentially some structural issues in the sector.\" Crucially, she said, Peverel's debt has been slashed from \u00a3125m to just \u00a325m. The debt was owed to Bank of America Merrill Lynch, which gets about \u00a360m net sale proceeds. The new debt financing of \u00a325m is being provided by Royal Bank of Scotland. Peverel had an \"inappropriate capital structure \u2013 that debt burden led to it being in administration,\" said Entwistle. Tchenguiz bought Peverel in 2007 with financial backing from Merrill Lynch, now part of Bank of America. Peverel's collapse came just days after he was arrested as part of a Serious Fraud Office investigation into the failure of Iceland's Kaupthing bank. The tycoon denied wrongdoing and the SFO apologised to Tchenguiz over the way it handled the investigation, admitting to \"very regrettable errors\". He has started a multimillion-pound damages claim against the SFO. A three-day judicicial review hearing is due to start on 22 May. The tycoon blamed Peverel's collapse on Bank of America Merrill Lynch's \"sudden\" decision after his arrest to demand repayment of the \u00a3125m loan plus \u00a311m interest. Chamonix, an investment firm founded in 2006, had been working on the rescue deal for a year and brought in Electra, which is investing \u00a333m of equity in Peverel. Andrew Hartley, one of Chamonix's three partners, said the two firms would invest in improving IT and services, and expanding Peverel's telecare and telehealth arms. Careline, Peverel's telecare subsidiary, provides social alarm call monitoring through alarm systems wired up to people's homes or by wearing a pendant which activates if they suffer a fall.

UBS slashed its earnings forecasts by 6% to 22% between 2012 and 2015, reflecting a cut in its forecast gold output since it believes output from the Amursk site is unlikely before 2013. UBS said:</p> <blockquote> We view Polymetal as a high-quality name with an attractive 2010-15 estimated output compound annual growth rate of 11%, though we think this growth is largely priced in. Without catalysts such as a strong gold/silver price or expansion in reserves base, the stock is unlikely to outperform the sector in the short term. <br> </blockquote> <p>Mining shares were generally weaker in the wake of China cutting its growth forecasts on Monday. <strong>Fresnillo</strong> bucked the trend for much of the day after a 63% rise in full year profits, but finally caved in to close down 2p at \u00a318.30.</p> <p>Overall, growing concerns about Greece ahead of this week's deadline for agreement with its private bondholders, as well as poor European surveys and China's downgrade on Monday, left the <strong>FTSE 100 </strong>109.02 points lower at 5765.80. This left the leading index at its lowest level since 31 January. Germany and French markets were even worst hit, each down more than 3%.

      "bodyText": "As the FTSE 100 recorded its biggest one day fall since 14 December on renewed fears about a Greek default and a global economic slowdown, the leading loser was Russian gold miner Polymetal. The company's shares slumped 64.5p to 951.5p after analysts at UBS moved from buy to neutral and cut their price target from \u00a314 to \u00a311. UBS slashed its earnings forecasts by 6% to 22% between 2012 and 2015, reflecting a cut in its forecast gold output since it believes output from the Amursk site is unlikely before 2013. UBS said: We view Polymetal as a high-quality name with an attractive 2010-15 estimated output compound annual growth rate of 11%, though we think this growth is largely priced in. Without catalysts such as a strong gold/silver price or expansion in reserves base, the stock is unlikely to outperform the sector in the short term. Mining shares were generally weaker in the wake of China cutting its growth forecasts on Monday. Fresnillo bucked the trend for much of the day after a 63% rise in full year profits, but finally caved in to close down 2p at \u00a318.30. Overall, growing concerns about Greece ahead of this week's deadline for agreement with its private bondholders, as well as poor European surveys and China's downgrade on Monday, left the FTSE 100 109.02 points lower at 5765.80. This left the leading index at its lowest level since 31 January. Germany and French markets were even worst hit, each down more than 3%. Josh Raymond at City Index said: March not always a great month for the FTSE. The last 11 years has seen March be a bearish month six times. When it's bearish, the average loss is 2.4%. There were only two risers in the leading index.

France remains in fifth place behind Germany, Japan, China and the US. The per capita income of Brazilians remains less than a third of that enjoyed in the UK at $11,000 (\u00a37,000) per head, but the situation is improving all the time while western economies largely stagnate.

And it's not about to hit the buffers any time soon. Population: Partly explains the above. As well as being the world's sixth largest economy, Brazil is also the world's sixth most populous country. It has around 200 million people and is (another plus) overwhelmingly young: some 62% of Brazilians are under 29 years of age. The country also has the the largest number of people of Japanese descent outside Japan. Although that's probably not relevant. Football: Now we're getting to it.

The latest figures suggest the UK economy grew by a lousy 0.9% for the full year, having actually gone into reverse by 0.2% at the end of the year. The gloomier forecasts for this year predict a further 1% shrinkage. Go Blighty! Population: Well, we're trying. Britain's population is growing at its fastest rate in almost half a century, but it's still barely a third the size of Brazil's. According to the Office for National Statistics, 62.3 million people were living in Britain in 2010, around 0.8% more than the previous year.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The UK's leading dry cleaner has provided further evidence of squeezed disposable incomes and changing times on the high street, reporting falling sales and \"tough\" trading. The company behind the Johnson Cleaners chain and the predominantly London-based upmarket Jeeves of Belgravia stores said its dry-cleaning revenues were down 1.8% at \u00a377.3m last year, with operating profits flat at \u00a32m. Highlighting a tough economic backdrop, Johnson Service Group cited falls in business in the aftermath of \"negative newsflow\" during 2011. \"High-street trading remained tough in 2011, as economic conditions put severe pressure on disposable incomes, which consequently impacted upon the number of visitors to the high street and ultimately on the quality of businesses continuing to operate,\" the company said in its full-year results. As the makeup of high streets changes and fewer people shop there, the company is looking to more convenient, car-friendly locations for its dry cleaners such as petrol stations and big supermarkets. Meanwhile workers squeezed by a combination of near-stagnant wages and high inflation appear to be cutting back on dry-cleaning spending, for example by waiting longer before getting suits laundered. Against that backdrop, Johnson said it had slowed down its store refurbishment programme and closed some stores altogether \"as we continue to actively withdraw from poorer locations and focus our attention on more convenient sites\". In contrast, Johnson's luxury London business echoes other evidence of a growing north-south economic divide. Its Jeeves of Belgravia business enjoyed a \"year of high activity\", opening new stores in St Paul's last year and Notting Hill this year. It is also tapping into another bracket of society seemingly untouched by the economic downturn, with a new branch in the Premier League footballer-dominated area of Alderley Edge, Cheshire. Shares in Johnson Service, which also hires out work uniforms and linen to the hospitality industry, ticked higher in early trading after the overall group reported a rise in profits and raised its dividend. Adjusted profit before tax rose 3.4% to \u00a315m while the final 2011 dividend was increased a fifth to 0.67p, making 1p for the full year. The chairman, John Talbot, said: \"I am pleased with these results given the very difficult market conditions.\" But he added that market conditions were not expected to improve in 2012.",

Its Jeeves of Belgravia business enjoyed a \"year of high activity\", opening new stores in St Paul's last year and Notting Hill this year. It is also tapping into another bracket of society seemingly untouched by the economic downturn, with a new branch in the Premier League footballer-dominated area of Alderley Edge, Cheshire.</p> <p>Shares in Johnson Service, which also hires out work uniforms and linen to the hospitality industry, ticked higher in early trading after the overall group reported a rise in profits and raised its dividend.</p> <p>Adjusted profit before tax rose 3.4% to \u00a315m while the final 2011 dividend was increased a fifth to 0.67p, making 1p for the full year.</p> <p>The chairman, John Talbot, said: \"I am pleased with these results given the very difficult market conditions.\" But he added that market conditions were not expected to improve in 2012.</p>",

      "bodyText": "General Motors has failed to guarantee that the Ellesmere Port plant will stay open beyond 2014 as the business secretary, Vince Cable, admitted that the future of the factory and 2,800 jobs was a \"commercial decision\" for the car maker. GM's vice-chairman, Steve Girsky, said the world's largest automotive group would uphold a labour agreement that spares its European plants from closure before 2014, but would not be drawn on the future of Ellesmere Port \u2013 one of the factories under threat from a review of its European business. Asked to comment on the facility's long-term prospects, he said: \"Ellesmere Port has been a good plant for us in the past. They produce good product \u2026 We produce vehicles in a lot of different parts of the world. We understand we have too much capacity. We have to understand the best ways of producing product for our customers.\" Girsky was similarly non-committal at last week's New York summit with Cable, where he was joined by GM's chief executive, Dan Akerson. Cable urged GM to keep Ellesmere Port open at the meeting, one of several that senior government figures have held with the business this year. Girsky said: \"We chatted about the economic situation in Europe, we chatted about the UK, the competitiveness of the UK industry \u2026 it was very constructive.\" Asked if Cable sought assurances that Ellesmere Port would not be shut, Girsky said: \"That was his pitch.\" Repeating a mantra throughout the press briefing at GM's Opel stand at Geneva, Girsky declined to comment on specific sites and said GM looked at its manufacturing operations on a \"global basis\". Adding that GM would stick to a labour deal that limits factory closures before 2014, Girsky indicated nonetheless that there would be job losses from its European business. \"We know in the future that there may not be the same amount of people here as there are today. It is important that we create an appropriate safety net for these people \u2026 We have to make sure everybody understands the environment that we are dealing with.\" Echoing comments from the other mass-market producers in Europe, from Peugeot to Fiat and Renault, Girsky said car makers had to adapt to a \"new reality\" for a European market that would sell 12m cars this year compared with more than 14m before the credit crunch. \"We need to develop a new plan, which is being developed as we speak, for the new economic reality in Europe,\" he said. Girsky spoke as Cable attended the motor show to mark Nissan's announcement that 400 jobs would be created at its Sunderland plant by the manufacture of a new compact car, the Invitation. However, Ellesmere Port dominated the agenda as Cable indicated that the matter was now in GM's hands. Asked if GM would keep the plant open, Cable said: \"There is no value in my guessing. It is not my decision. The UK has a very, very good case and we have made a strong pitch to them.\" Cable said the government was not offering financial support to keep Ellesmere Port open and that GM had to \"make a commercial decision\". Asked about the possibility of financial support from the taxpayer, in the wake of the scrappage scheme that took the UK industry off life support in 2009, he said: \"The discussion is not taking that form. We have made a very good case to them. GM is not looking for money. The decision \u2026 will be made on commercial grounds.\" GM produces around 1.4m vehicles per year under the Opel and Vauxhall brands, the latter built at Ellesmere Port and a van plant in Luton. GM believes it is 400,000 units over capacity, which is the equivalent of two factories' worth of output \u2013 putting Ellesmere Port and Bochum in Germany in the firing line. Cable added that, GM aside, the UK car industry was entering 2012 off the back of a strong year, which included jobs and investment announcements by Jaguar Land Rover, Toyota and BMW \u2013 all of whom have stands at the glitzy Geneva show. \"You can go down the list,\" said Cable. Pointing to the Nissan job news, which was supported by \u00a39m from the government's regional growth fund, Cable said: \"You have got the sense that the automotive industry in the UK is a success story and this reinforces the confidence of the companies here.\"",

      "bodyText": "European car manufacturers are suffering from an unsustainable production glut, the boss of Vauxhall Motors has warned at the start of the 2012 Geneva Motor Show. Duncan Aldred spoke as executives at Vauxhall's parent, General Motors, mulled the closure of the Ellesmere Port factory with the loss of up to 2,800 jobs. Speaking in Geneva, Aldred said business plans drawn up shortly before the credit crunch were based on the expectation of selling 20m cars a year in Europe alone by 2014. This year, analysts expect 12m cars to be sold in western Europe. \"There is too much capacity. The industry cannot sustain forever the level of capacity it has got.\" He added: \"It does not create a good business model.\" GM's European operations, where the US group makes the Opel and Vauxhall brands, lost $747m (\u00a3471m) last year \u2013 a performance described as \"simply unacceptable\" by GM. Warning of another difficult year for European mass-volume car makers, Aldred added that sales had collapsed in some parts of southern Europe. Aldred declined to comment on the future of Ellesmere Port, which is believed to be on the critical list alongside GM's Opel plant in Bochum, Germany. However, Aldred paid tribute to GM's UK operations, pointing to the amount of executive talent they have produced over the years. \"The [GM] operation is filled with a lot of UK guys \u2026 We are a great exporter of both ideas and talent.\" Aldred, appointed chairman of Vauxhall in January, added that the pound's competitiveness against the euro gave the UK an ongoing advantage in manufacturing.

The business secretary, Vince Cable, faces further questions about Ellesmere Port's future this morning when he attends the Nissan press conference in Geneva. Nissan will announce the creation of 400 new jobs at its Sunderland plant, the largest in the UK, as well as up to 1,600 more in the supply chain when it confirms that a new compact car is to be built in the north-east. Separately, the French car maker Peugeot Citro\u00ebn has announced it will hold a \u20ac1bn (\u00a3832m) rights issue to fund its alliance with GM. \"This will allow us to accelerate our international expansion and our move into higher-end models faster than we would have been able to do on our own,\" said Jean-Baptiste de Chatillon, the chief financial officer of PSA Peugeot.",

Until last week, economic indicators revealed a more positive mood and many economists predicted the UK would narrowly escape a double-dip recession. The latest surveys of business health appear to show that trend has reversed. Osborne is expected to tell parliament later this month that the choppy and unpredictable nature of the recovery continues to restrict his room for manoeuvre. He is expected to reject calls for his budget on 21 March to provide a spending boost in response to the weakening economic data.

More than 70 business leaders signed an open letter to chancellor George Osborne and transport secretary Justine Greening, published at the weekend in the Sunday Telegraph, demanding an aviation strategy for growth that \"considers all options\" \u2013 a thinly veiled demand to back Heathrow, for which a third runway was explicitly ruled out again in the autumn statement BAA on Monday reiterated its threat to seek a judicial review if Heathrow is pre-emptively removed from consideration before any consultations on expanding airport capacity.
