    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Pressure on Greece's recession-stricken economy has intensified after international debt inspectors admitted an additional \u20ac15bn (\u00a312.5bn) would be needed to fill a newly discovered black hole in the country's finances. On a day when Ireland's government reduced its growth forecast and Madrid told Spanish banks to raise an extra \u20ac50bn to cover toxic assets, Brussels officials said European countries and state-owned banks would be asked for contributions to help Athens out of its fiscal troubles. The fresh evidence of Greece's desperate financial plight came as it continued to discuss the terms of a deal with private sector creditors aimed at writing down debts by \u20ac100bn, and was an admission that the \"haircut\" being taken by banks, hedge funds and insurance companies would not be enough on its own to remove the risk of a default. International Monetary Fund officials said that time was running out to finalise the negotiations in time to trigger payment of the next tranche of its \u20ac130bn bailout from the European commission, the European Union and the IMF. The so-called troika has recognised in the past few days that Greece faces an impossible task in reducing debt when the economy is in such deep recession, and now accepts that the country's sovereign creditors will have to supplement the debt relief being provided by the private sector. Spending cuts, tax increases and the general uncertainty of the crisis have already pushed Greece into a slump, which in turn has eliminated many of the gains from the austerity measures. Although China's premier, Wen Jiabao, raised hopes after talks with the German chancellor Angela Merkel that the world's fastest-growing emerging economy would consider boosting its contribution to Europe's bailout fund, there were fresh signs of strain in those countries most affected by the sovereign debt crisis. Spain's finance minister, Luis de Guindos, ushered in a fresh round of consolidation when he told banks they had to make provision for bad loans and write downs in the country's troubled property sector. With Spain falling into the second part of a double-dip recession and unemployment at 23%, de Guindos's new rules exposed the still dire state of the property market. Officials claimed it was the most ambitious attempt to cleanse banks' balance sheets in Europe. \"Spain's banking system will emerge from this process stronger, with fewer but more solid banks,\" the economy ministry said. Banks have absorbed large amounts of toxic assets as building developers default on loans in a country with a glut of 500,000 unsold new homes. They have already made provision for a third of the \u20ac176bn of \"troubled\" assets on their books, according to Spain's central bank. Under the new rules total provisions against building lots, many of which are illiquid, will reach 80%. Those against ongoing building developments will hit 65%, while provisions against completed houses will reach 35%. The measures show how developers, rather than mortgage-holders, became the biggest danger to Spain's banking system after politically controlled savings banks lent freely to them during a dizzying building boom that halted in 2008. Many of those banks have already disappeared after a round of mergers that began in 2009. The fresh mergers will reduce the total even further, with all eyes now on Bankia, a troubled group formed from the merger of seven savings banks. The country's bank restructuring fund will receive a \u20ac15bn top-up, though this will not add to the deficit. Banking reform was one of the major planks of a programme promised by conservative People's party prime minister Mariano Rajoy, who won November elections. Meanwhile, Ireland's central bank slashed its growth forecast for 2012 from 1.8% to just 0.5%, blaming a slowdown in consumer spending and a tougher outlook for exports due to Europe's debt crisis. Taoiseach Enda Kenny refused to accept the government's more optimistic budget forecasts were out of line with those from the central bank and claimed the real priority was creating jobs. \"The government's growth figures are median figures and we are prepared to stand by those,\" said Kenny. Market attention on Friday will focus on the US where the latest official unemployment data is expected to show further slight improvement in the job market. While the unemployment rate for January is likely to stay at 8.5%, the world's largest economy is expected to have added 150,000 jobs. That is slightly below growth of 200,000 in December, however, with economists expecting seasonal layoffs of couriers after Christmas to knock job creation. Data on Thursday reinforced a growing view the US labour market is slowly improving, with new claims for unemployment benefits falling more than expected last week. US Federal Reserve chairman Ben Bernanke sought to reassure markets that there had been signs of modest improvement in the labour market, but conceded the pace of recovery was slow. Bernanke told Congress there were signs uncertainty dogging the US economy was letting up, but that the eurozone crisis still threatened the country's recovery.",

As part of the restructuring, it also plans to create a \"virtual\" neuroscience unit out of two small research teams based in Boston in the US and Cambridge in the UK. The cuts, to be made over the next three years, come on top of 21,460 jobs cut since 2007 as part of a global reorganisation of the group, including big reductions in its US sales force. AstraZeneca employs 61,000 people worldwide, with 8,000 on the payroll in the UK. The latest cuts, which will cost $2.1bn (\u00a31.4bn) to implement, are expected to save $1.6bn a year by the end of 2014. The news came as Smith &amp; Nephew, the artificial hip and knee maker, announced it was shedding 550 more administrative jobs. It plans to cut 7% of its 11,000 employees worldwide over the next three years, including 220 jobs that have already gone. It is unclear how many of its 1,400 UK staff will be affected. About 250 to 300 of the 3,000 R&amp;D staff at AstraZeneca's Alderley Park labs in Cheshire will be made redundant, the company said, as it merges its cardiovascular and gastrointestinal research teams. Unions said there would also be back-office cuts at other UK sites. Allan Black of the GMB union warned that axing R&amp;D jobs would damage the economy. \"These cutting-edge R&amp;D jobs are both well paid and essential for a thriving UK economy,\" he said. The Unite union added: \"This is a blow to Britain's research and development base and Unite will be doing everything possible to minimise compulsory redundancies at Alderley Park.\" AstraZeneca, which is Britain's second-biggest drugmaker, and closed a research centre at Charnwood near Loughborough at the end of last year, does not plan to shut any more sites in the UK. It is laying off \"several hundred\" neuroscientists and shutting its neuroscience research sites in S\u00f6dert\u00e4lje in Sweden and Montreal in Canada. With up to 1,250 job losses, Sweden is bearing the brunt of the 2,200 R&amp;D job cuts worldwide. AstraZeneca is also shedding 3,750 sales and administrative staff, and 1,350 factory and back-office workers. In a new attempt to \"crack neuroscience\" \u2013 its last major product in this field was the 1997 antipsychotic drug Seroquel \u2013 AstraZeneca will now have a small team of 40-50 scientists working on cures for diseases like Alzheimer's as part of a \"virtual\" neuroscience unit. The team will be based in Boston, Massachusetts and Cambridge in the UK and will be working with academics (for instance, Sweden's Karolinska Institute) and biotech firms. AstraZeneca's R&amp;D chief, Martin Mackay, said: \"This is our way of saying: We need to access the best science. Some other groups have gone down the virtual route, but this is unprecedented in scale.\" He added that the new neuroscience unit would not be replicated in other areas as AstraZeneca's own scientists were already doing a good job in cancer, cardiovascular and infectious diseases research. The group's profits before tax dropped 10% to $2.05bn between October and December, although over the year as a whole profits rose 13% to $12.4bn. Annual revenues fell 2% to $33bn, with nearly $2bn lost to competition from generic drugs and a further $1bn to government-enforced price cuts. Noting that two-thirds of the growth in the last five years had come from emerging markets like India and China, chief executive David Brennan said: \"We see growth opportunities in emerging markets, but the industry is facing some tough challenges. There will be winners and losers. The decline in R&amp;D productivity is the single most important challenge.\" The company faces the loss of patent protection on many of its top-selling drugs over the next five years, including Seroquel and the ulcer treatment Nexium, and is struggling to replace them. It is focusing on just seven drugs in late-stage development. AstraZeneca suffered a double blow to its new drug pipeline in December when it scrapped an ovarian cancer drug and took a big writedown on an experimental antidepressant. The company is continuing its share buyback programme, with the pledge to return another $4.5bn to shareholders this year, more than the City had expected. \"Although the buyback programme is a positive, earnings per share guidance relies heavily on cost savings and the revenue outlook is weak,\" said analysts at Deutsche Bank. A year ago AstraZeneca's US rival Pfizer announced it would shut down its plant in Sandwich, Kentwith the loss of 2,400 jobs, leaving an area of deprivation on the Kent coast with few remaining private sector jobs.

The first effort in 1998 was scuppered amid a clash of executive egos. Both sets of shareholders were so angry they insisted the couple should patch up their differences. Even then it took 22 months, and a tweak in the merger terms in favour of SmithKline, to get the deal done. In theory, combining Glencore and Xstrata into one \u00a350bn giant is simpler. Glencore owns 34% of Xstrata, the latter being spun out of the former a decade ago. And, far from squabbling over who should sit in the chief executive's chair, a decision seems to have been made. Glencore's Ivan Glasenberg has been chomping at the bit to do this deal for years and is so keen that he's happy to be deputy to Xstrata's Mick Davis. That would set up the strange dynamic of Davis being boss over his largest shareholder (since Glasenberg's personal stake is worth about \u00a34bn) but, hey, everybody would be able to smile in harmony on day one. That leaves the financial terms. But they may prove harder to crack since there's no such thing as a merger of equals, whatever the investment bankers and spinners say. Deals are always constructed as company A making an offer for company B. In this case Glencore would offer to buy Xstrata, and it's nonsense to suppose ownership of the combined pie can be determined solely by yesterday's share prices. The old principle remains sound: takeovers require a price premium to reflect loss of control. As Simon Toyne of broker Redburn puts it: \"Xstrata shareholders without a Glencore shareholding will logically demand a significant premium to be absorbed into a Glencore/Xstata combination \u2013 they could have owned Glencore shares if they had wanted exposure to Glencore.\" It falls to Xstrata's independent directors \u2013 led by chairman Sir John Bond, the ex-HSBC chair \u2013 not to roll over too easily. Glasenberg says \"we've always had the belief these two companies should be together\". The correct response by Bond is: \"If you offer sufficiently attractive terms, they can be; but don't take us for granted.\" Xstrata shareholders have two reasons to be wary. First, Glasenberg is attempting this deal only eight months after floating Glencore. One purpose of the listing was to allow the market to put a price on his acquisition currency, Glencore shares. But is eight months long enough to make a proper judgment? Glencore is a strange beast \u2013 part trader, part logistics operation, part miner \u2013 that may yet have mysteries to reveal. Xstata's near-time future, on the other hand, looks clearer: it's got lots of new mines about to open. Second, Xstrata's shareholders have to weigh the merit of mixing their pure mining company with Glencore's trading activities. The combination, it is said, would yield juicy savings \u2013 anything from $500m upwards, depending on whose projections you prefer. But how solid are they really? On paper, Glencore's trading and marketing folk could achieve higher profit margins if they could get their hands on all of Xstrata's output, rather than just some of it. But that sounds a roundabout way of making the customers pay more; in practice, the customers will try to bite back. Indeed, the world of commodities is slowly edging towards greater transparency in pricing via the use of more spot markets. Sceptics of the Glencore model argue that the glory days of \"supernormal\" profits from trading are over. That's why, they say, Glasenberg is in such a rush to acquire Xstata's mines \u2013 it's a way to de-risk Glencore and his personal fortune. Correct or not, it's an argument Bond could usefully deploy during the hard bargaining over price. It's still odds-on that the deal will happen at the first time of asking, since miners love to be big and Glencore's 34% stake makes it impossible for Bond to whip up an auction for Xstrata. But don't rule out a lengthy dance with several stumbles, as with Glaxo and SmithKline. After all, Xstrata's independent directors can be sure on one point: if Glasenberg doesn't bag his prey this time, he'll be back.",

    "webTitle": "Shell profits up 54% to \u00a32m an hour", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Shell has been accused of \"moral bankruptcy\" by unions after unveiling a 54% rise in full-year profits less than a month after shutting its final salary pension scheme to new employees in Britain. The oil company reported global annual earnings of $28.6bn (\u00a318bn) \u2013 more than \u00a32m an hour \u2013 while paying out $10.5bn to shareholders during 2011 and promising to raise dividend levels further in the coming months. Peter Voser, Shell's chief executive, said \"there is more [good profit] to come\" as he outlined a new programme of increased global investment as well as cuts that he said would provide even better returns for investors. \"We have worked hard to generate a strong pipeline of investment opportunities for Shell \u2026 All of this is supported by efficiency gains from our continuous improvement programmes,\" Voser said. But Europe's largest oil group was attacked for displaying \"predatory capitalism\" by Len McCluskey, leader of the Unite union. \"Shell reminds us of the moral bankruptcy of the corporate elite. The company is needlessly closing its final salary scheme while posting colossal profits,\" he said. \"Rather than provide security to its future staff and still make a profit, it has chosen greed. Shell is not alone: Unilever is needlessly slashing its employees' pension benefits when there is no financial reason for doing so.\" Shell, which has also upset staff by unveiling plans to shut its major research and development centre at Stanlow in Cheshire after disposing of its refinery there, said it was surprised by the attack. A spokesman pointed out that most government and private pension schemes paid in Britain were supported by Shell, which provides 12% of all dividends from the FTSE 100 index of leading firms. The Anglo-Dutch group is riding high on the back of surging oil prices \u2013 which were more than $30 per barrel higher last year than in 2010 \u2013 and booming demand for gas, but says it is making most of its money outside Britain and makes barely 1p per litre out of petrol sales. Voser pointed out that two thirds of the UK pump price went straight to the government as tax. He blamed near record prices for forecourt diesel on global crude market conditions and said Shell's UK retail operations continued to come under \"very heavy competitive pressures\". Shell would continue to invest in the North Sea in oil projects such as those it has west of Shetland, but said there was a need for the right \"tax structures to keep the oil and gas industry alive here\". The company was doing \"our bit for balancing the books\" of the Treasury through paying a heavy tax burden, it said, while denying that its recent sale of the Stanlow refinery to an Indian group had any impact on the wider refining and distribution problems that have recently hit the south-east of England. Shares in Shell rose 11% last year while arch-rivals such as BP saw no growth at all but on Thursday the Anglo-Dutch group's stock market valuation fell slightly as the City was disappointed by the financial performance in the last quarter of the year. Shell reported three-monthly earnings of $6.5bn, which was up on the same period last year but down quite heavily on the third quarter. Total oil and gas production in the fourth quarter was lower, at 3.3m barrels of oil equivalent per day compared with 3.49m barrels a year ago. Shell said it would increase annual production to 3.7m barrels by 2014, helped by a $100bn investment plan which started in 2010. The company said it would put much of its drilling efforts into the US and it now claims to have become the biggest driller \u2013 but not producer \u2013 in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico where BP used to reign supreme. Since the government moratorium on drilling in the Gulf, imposed following BP's Deepwater Horizon spill, was lifted, Shell has obtained permission to drill five wells during 2012. The company said it was treading carefully, meanwhile, in the Middle East in the wake of the Arab spring, but hopes to reveal soon how its exploration programme has been going in Saudi Arabia and when it plans to get back to similar work in Libya. Shale hopes Shell is hoping to turn the \"shale gas revolution\" sweeping north America into an export earner but also expects to see the controversial new energy source taking off in Europe once an \"emotional\" debate dies down. The Anglo Dutch oil company is looking at possible plans to ship surplus quantities of the fuel, as liquefied natural gas or \"gas-to-liquid\" processed fuel, from the US. Natural gas prices in north America have fallen to a 10-year low due to the discovery that gas can be extracted from shale rock using a technique known as hydraulic fracturing or \"fracking\". It uses an assortment of chemicals to release gas with tiny explosions and has upset environmentalists and some politicians. Peter Voser, chief executive of Shell, said $6bn would be spent worldwide on different kinds of shale gas operation, half of this in the US. The heavily populated nature of Europe versus the US made it more difficult to \"frack\" this side of the Atlantic, Voser conceded, but he said governments should \"not take fast and emotional decisions\" to restrict shale extraction. Shell expects Poland and even Germany to proceed with shale gas exploitation but it is also looking at operations in Ukraine and China.",

      "body": "<p>Shell has been accused of \"moral bankruptcy\" by unions after unveiling a 54% rise in full-year profits less than a month after shutting its final salary pension scheme to new employees in Britain.</p> <p>The oil company reported global annual earnings of $28.6bn (\u00a318bn) \u2013 more than \u00a32m an hour \u2013 while paying out $10.5bn to shareholders during 2011 and promising to raise dividend levels further in the coming months.</p> <p>Peter Voser, Shell's chief executive, said \"there is more [good profit] to come\" as he outlined a new programme of increased global investment as well as cuts that he said would provide even better returns for investors.</p> <p>\"We have worked hard to generate a strong pipeline of investment opportunities for Shell \u2026 All of this is supported by efficiency gains from our continuous improvement programmes,\" Voser said.</p> <p>But Europe's largest oil group was attacked for displaying \"predatory capitalism\" by Len McCluskey, leader of the Unite union. \"Shell reminds us of the moral bankruptcy of the corporate elite. The company is needlessly closing its final salary scheme while posting colossal profits,\" he said. \"Rather than provide security to its future staff and still make a profit, it has chosen greed. Shell is not alone: Unilever is needlessly slashing its employees' pension benefits when there is no financial reason for doing so.\"</p> <p>Shell, which has also upset staff by unveiling plans to shut its major research and development centre at Stanlow in Cheshire after disposing of its refinery there, said it was surprised by the attack.</p> <p>A spokesman pointed out that most government and private pension schemes paid in Britain were supported by Shell, which provides 12% of all dividends from the FTSE 100 index of leading firms.</p> <p>The Anglo-Dutch group is riding high on the back of surging oil prices \u2013 which were more than $30 per barrel higher last year than in 2010 \u2013 and booming demand for gas, but says it is making most of its money outside Britain and makes barely 1p per litre out of petrol sales.</p> <p>Voser pointed out that two thirds of the UK pump price went straight to the government as tax. He blamed near record prices for forecourt diesel on global crude market conditions and said Shell's UK retail operations continued to come under \"very heavy competitive pressures\".</p> <p>Shell would continue to invest in the North Sea in oil projects such as those it has west of Shetland, but said there was a need for the right \"tax structures to keep the oil and gas industry alive here\".</p> <p>The company was doing \"our bit for balancing the books\" of the Treasury through paying a heavy tax burden, it said, while denying that its recent sale of the Stanlow refinery to an Indian group had any impact on the wider refining and distribution problems that have recently hit the south-east of England.</p> <p>Shares in Shell rose 11% last year while arch-rivals such as BP saw no growth at all but on Thursday the Anglo-Dutch group's stock market valuation fell slightly as the City was disappointed by the financial performance in the last quarter of the year.</p> <p>Shell reported three-monthly earnings of $6.5bn, which was up on the same period last year but down quite heavily on the third quarter.</p> <p>Total oil and gas production in the fourth quarter was lower, at 3.3m barrels of oil equivalent per day compared with 3.49m barrels a year ago. Shell said it would increase annual production to 3.7m barrels by 2014, helped by a $100bn investment plan which started in 2010.</p> <p>The company said it would put much of its drilling efforts into the US and it now claims to have become the biggest driller \u2013 but not producer \u2013 in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico where BP used to reign supreme. Since the government moratorium on drilling in the Gulf, imposed following BP's Deepwater Horizon spill, was lifted, Shell has obtained permission to drill five wells during 2012.</p> <p>The company said it was treading carefully, meanwhile, in the Middle East in the wake of the Arab spring, but hopes to reveal soon how its exploration programme has been going in Saudi Arabia and when it plans to get back to similar work in Libya.</p> <h2>Shale hopes</h2> <p>Shell is hoping to turn the \"shale gas revolution\" sweeping north America into an export earner but also expects to see the controversial new energy source taking off in Europe once an \"emotional\" debate dies down.</p> <p>The Anglo Dutch oil company is looking at possible plans to ship surplus quantities of the fuel, as liquefied natural gas or \"gas-to-liquid\" processed fuel, from the US.</p> <p>Natural gas prices in north America have fallen to a 10-year low due to the discovery that gas can be extracted from shale rock using a technique known as hydraulic fracturing or \"fracking\". It uses an assortment of chemicals to release gas with tiny explosions and has upset environmentalists and some politicians.</p> <p>Peter Voser, chief executive of Shell, said $6bn would be spent worldwide on different kinds of shale gas operation, half of this in the US. The heavily populated nature of Europe versus the US made it more difficult to \"frack\" this side of the Atlantic, Voser conceded, but he said governments should \"not take fast and emotional decisions\" to restrict shale extraction. Shell expects Poland and even Germany to proceed with shale gas exploitation but it is also looking at operations in Ukraine and China.</p>",

As housing and civil engineering companies reported falling business in January, the construction sector only just managed to keep growing, according to a survey. The headline activity reading dropped to 51.4 from 53.2 in December in the Markit/CIPS UK construction PMI survey. That was above the 50-mark that separates growth from contraction for the 13th straight month. But it undershot economists' forecasts for 52.6 and was the weakest for four months. Survey compilers Markit said the slowdown in growth was led by weaker new order growth, with companies reporting reductions in clients' budgets. Still, construction companies were generally more optimistic about activity picking up in the year ahead. The survey's confidence reading was the highest since May 2011 as companies cited help from improving economic conditions and new marketing initiatives. \"This suggests that growth may pick up again in the sector in coming months and, on top of the surprisingly strong start to 2012 reported by the sister survey of manufacturing, will raise hopes that a slide back into recession may yet be avoided,\" said Sarah Bingham, economist at Markit. The manufacturing sector enjoyed its strongest production growth for almost a year in January, according to the PMI survey for the sector published earlier this week. That gave a boost to government and business hopes that recession can still be averted despite a slight downturn in overall growth at the end of 2011. But fears remain that unemployment has much further to rise as many businesses hold off hiring new workers amid many uncertainties. In construction, the only sub-sector to post growth last month was commercial construction and Markit said that was not enough to create jobs in the wider sector.",

      "bodyText": "Commodities trader Glencore and miner Xstrata are in active talks about merging to create a \u00a350bn global mining group. News of the talks, which could lead to a deal being formally announced as early as next week, sent shares in Xstrata rocketing almost 10% to close at \u00a312.30 and Glencore shares were up almost 7% to 461.70p. New UK \"put up or shut up\" takeover rules mean that Glencore, the world's biggest commodities trader, now has until 1 March to make a formal offer. Xstrata informed the market on Thursday morning that Glencore had approached it over a \"merger of equals\". However both companies cautioned that \"there can be no certainty that any offer will be made\". Ivan Glasenberg, Glencore's chief executive, has been pushing for the deal for years, and Glencore has already built up a 34% stake in Xstrata. Glasenberg, a former coal trader who led the company to a \u00a338bn flotation in London in May, said in August that he was \"aggressively\" seeking mergers and acquisitions as the market value of rivals slide.

A source close to the deal said it was expected that Davis will become chief executive of the combined group if the deal goes ahead. It was suggested that Davis would be better placed because the combined company would primarily remain a miner rather than a trader. Glasenberg is expected to become deputy chief executive. The merger of the two companies, which occupy headquarters just two miles apart in Switzerland \u2013 where they are based for tax reasons \u2013 would create the world's fifth-biggest listed mining group. The deal comes a decade after Glencore was instrumental in helping Xstrata list on the London stock market when it sold the Swiss miner its coal assets. Glencore was founded by Marc Rich, a commodities trader best known for being charged by US authorities with selling oil to Iran during the 1979-81 hostage crisis. The motivation for the initial public offering, which transformed Glasenberg and four other partners into billionaires and created hundreds of millionaires, was widely seen as a way to obtain a fair market valuation of the company to allow the Xstrata deal to go ahead. \"These two companies were expected to merge and this is obviously a little bit faster than we had anticipated, but it makes sense given how the companies have performed and the current market positions,\" said Collins Stewart analyst Tim Dudley. \"Glencore being such a dominant trader and marketer of commodities, and Xstrata being such as strong operator of difficult assets, I think it creates enormous value,\" Prasad Patkar of Platypus Asset Management in Sydney, told Bloomberg. \"On one end you have great mining expertise, on the other you've got great marketing expertise.
