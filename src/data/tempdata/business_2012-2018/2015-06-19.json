      "bodyText": "On that note it\u2019s time to close up for the evening, and indeed the week. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back next week (unless anything dramatic happens later.) Meanwhile according to Reuters, index compiler MSCI says it is monitoring investors\u2019 access to Greek equity markets. Any restrictions may lead it to change Greece\u2019s to a standalone market from emerging market. MSCI said: Some measures available to Greek authorities to manage the economic situation, e.g., imposition of capital controls, could have a significant impact on the replicability and investability of the MSCI Greece Index and consequently the MSCI Emerging Markets Index. Any move would come after a public consultation. Some evidence is emerging that big banks are becoming even more cautious in their dealings with Greece, writes Jill Treanor. Morgan Stanley is said to be telling clients that while it is happy to take their orders to buy and sell stocks on the Athens stock market it is less willing to take any risks associated with settling the transactions. Barclays is also rumoured to be adding in an extra layer of approvals from its risk management department before dealing in Athens. Neither bank would comment. Over In Athens opposition MPs say prime minister Alexis Tsipras now faces the toughest of choices - either he bites the bullet and accepts implementing \u20ac5bn worth of austerity measures or he allows Greece to go bankrupt at the end of the month. Helena Smith reports: Ahead of a weekend of what is bound to be feverish negotiation within his party\u2019s own ranks, the Greek prime minister will soon have to make the most difficult of decisions. \u201cThere is no good scenario,\u201d Anna Asimakopoulou, a shadow finance minister with the opposition New Democracy party told me this afternoon. \u201cThere is a bad scenario and a worst-case scenario. Either Tsipras agrees to take austerity measures worth \u20ac5bn, because that is what the Europeans are asking, or he takes Greece out of the eurozone And the problem is this. He doesn\u2019t have a mandate for either.\u201d The rhetoric has got so heated in the week since talks between Athens and international creditors broke down that many fear the radical left leader will have no choice but to chose the latter. More from EC president Donald Tusk: More concern from the US over the Greek crisis, as reported by Reuters: The possibility that Greece\u2019s mounting debt woes could disrupt world financial markets and impact the U.S. economy has been a big topic of discussion at the Federal Reserve, a top Fed official said on Friday. Though the baseline forecast is that even a Greek exit from the euro zone would not have a large spillover effect on the U.S. economy, there are concerns about the \u201ctail risk,\u201d San Francisco Fed President John Williams said. After another testing week for the eurozone - and further crisis talks between Greece and its partners on Monday - global markets turned in a mixed performance. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished up 2.57 points or 0.04% at 6710.45 Germany\u2019s Dax dropped 0.54% at 11,040.10 France\u2019s Cac closed up 0.25% at 4815.37 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB added 1.07% to 22,699.37 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended up 0.67% at 10,944.3 The Athens market added 0.57% to 687.33 On Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 52 points or 0.29% higher. The Kremlin said there was no discussion of financial aid for Athens at today\u2019s meeting between Russian president Vladimir Putin and Greek prime minister Alexis Tsipras, according to Reuters: Asked whether financial assistance had been discussed at the meeting on the sidelines of the St Petersburg International Economic Forum, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said: \u201cNo, no, no.\u201d An early schedule for Monday\u2019s EU summit: From 18.00 (central European time)- Arrival of the Heads of state or government of the Euro area (not in protocol order) 19.00 - Working dinner At the end of the meeting - Press conference by the President of the European Council and the President of the European Commission Another \u20ac1.2bn has been withdrawn from Greek banks today, according to Reuters. That brings the total outflow for the week to \u20ac4.2bn amid growing concerns about the lack of a deal between Greece and its creditors. One banker told Reuters: Today was a more difficult day compared to yesterday. Monday will likely be tough as well. Monday of course sees a summit of EU leaders, and another meeting of the European Central Bank after it raised the emergency liquidity ceiling for Greek banks today - for the second time this week. And more from eurozone member Slovakia on Greece. Earlier prime minister Robert Fico said his government was ready for Greece to leave the eurozone, although he would rather it didn\u2019t happen. Now Slovakia\u2019s finance minister Peter Ka\u017eim\u00edr has used his Twitter account to chip in , warning Greece to accept reality: More demonstrations have been called ahead of Monday\u2019s key summit: Monday\u2019s emergency summit of EU leaders was convened yesterday by President of the European Council Donald Tusk, and in a new video he repeated the warning that time is running out for a deal and said the time for games was over. He said the situation was getting critical, with four months of negotiations not leading to the necessary compromise. Thursday\u2019s Eurogroup meeting did not manage to break the deadlock and - in a possible dig at noted game theory adherent and Greek finance minister Yanis Varoufakis - he said: The game of chicken needs to end and so does the blame game. This is not a game and there is no time for any games. He said the purpose of Monday\u2019s summit was to make sure we all understand each other\u2019s positions and the consequences of our decisions. We need to get rid of the illusion there will be a magic solution at the leaders level. The summit will not be a final step. There will be long detailed technical negotiations. That remains the job of finance ministers. And in a warning to the Greeks he added: We are close to the point where the Greek government will have to chose between accepting what I believe is a good offer of continuing support, or head towards default. At the end of the day it can only be a Greek decision and a Greek responsibility. This would appear to be an obvious move, but still.. Time for a quick recap. The European Central Bank has agreed to a request from Greece for extra emergency liquidity to allow its banking sector to keep running as worried savers continue to withdraw cash. The decision means Greek banks should not run out of funds in the next few days, despite the threat that the country could fail to reach a bailout agreement and potentially exit the euro. It appears that the ECB has only given Greek banks enough extra funds to last until Monday night, when EU leaders will hold a summit to discuss the crisis. Athens made the request after eurozone finance ministers again failed to get close to a deal at talks on Thursday. That triggered renewed fears of a bank run in Greece. But the streets have been calm today, with depositors telling us that they aren\u2019t prepared to be frightened into emptying their accounts. Banking insiders have also said that withdrawals have been manageable. Greek prime minister Alexis Tsipras has predicted that Monday night\u2019s summit will yield a deal, adding: \u201cAll those who are betting on crisis and terror scenarios will be proven wrong.\u201d And he remained defiant, telling an audience in St Petersburg that Europe should return to its core values of solidarity and social justice. EU finance ministers have sounded generally downbeat today, as they reconvened in Luxembourg [photos here]. George Osborne, Britain\u2019s chancellor of the Exchequer, urged Greece\u2019s government to reach a deal now, before it is too late. We have entered the eleventh hour of this Greek crisis and we urge the Greek government to do a deal before it is too late. We hope for the best, but we now must be prepared for the worst. And Germany\u2019s Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble says he\u2019s not sure anything \u201csensational\u201d will be achieved on Monday night. German finance minister Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble isn\u2019t hopeful of a major breakthrough this weekend. Speaking after the European finance ministers meeting ended, a gloomy-sounding Sch\u00e4uble said: \u201cWe have to wait and see what and whether something happens in Greece by Monday....But I\u2019m not sure I\u2019ll be able to announce anything sensational or new.\u201d Extending more emergency liquidity funds to Greece is only a temporary measure, warns EC vice-president Valdis Dombrovskis. Speaking in Luxumbourg, Dombrovskis said: It is very clear that to regain financial stability a clear agreement is needed on the programme, and a credible strategy needs to be presented by the Greek authorities showing how they will regain financial stability and economic growth. Banking insiders have told the Guardian that the decision to hold an EU summit on Monday night calmed nerves on the streets today, helping preventing a bank run. One banker explained: \u201cWe\u2019re not observing panic because Monday\u2019s EU summit has been taken as a rather positive sign that we are moving towards a solution Whatever that solution will be, whether long, short, comprehensive or not is another thing. But this is what the [Greek] government has wanted for some time and if it tackles the debt, which no one has wanted to battle, all the better.\u201d In the absence of a formal announcement from the European Central Bank, there are conflicting reports on how much extra help Greek banks have just been given. CNBC believes the ECB has raised the emergency liquidity limit by \u20ac3.3bn, pretty much what we think Athens asked for: But the Financial Times\u2019s eurozone economy correspondent, Claire Jones, reckons Greece only got enough to last until Monday night. She writes: Policy makers on the governing council granted a smaller rise than the \u20ac3bn increase in emergency liquidity assistance (ELA) requested by the Bank of Greece, the country\u2019s central bank. The rise is meant to cover Greek banks for today and until close of business on Monday. The European Central Bank is going to reassess Greece\u2019s emergency funding programme again on Monday, says Reuters. That means Monday will be a very crucial day indeed, give eurozone finance ministers and EU leaders will both be holding crunch meetings to discuss Greece. Greece\u2019s prime minister, Alexis Tsipras, has just launched an attack on Europe\u2019s fixation on austerity, in a speech in St Petersburg. Just as the ECB decision was emerging, the Greek leader used his trip to Russia to call for more solidarity and social justice, shortly after a speech by Vladimir Putin. Tsipras said: As all of you are aware, we are at the moment at the centre of a storm of a whirlpool, but we live near the sea so we\u2019re not scared of the sea. We are ready to go to new seas to reach new safe ports. That sounds rather like a reference to a warmer relationship with Russia, at a time when Moscow is facing tougher sanctions over Ukraine. Tsipras continued: The problem we are facing is deeply rooted in the process I have described. The EU should pursue its own path. The EU should go back to its initial principals of solidarity and social justice. Ensuring strict economic measures will lead us nowhere. The so-called problem of Greece is the problem of the whole European Union. The sight of Tsipras pressing the flesh in Russia at this vital time may not please EU leaders (although, as a German spokesman pointed out, the Greek leader can go where he likes). They may be more disappointed that he didn\u2019t give any sign of embracing the structural reforms demanded by creditors. My colleague Mark Rice-Oxley watched the speech and tweeted the key points: The ECB\u2019s decision is reassuring news for anyone heading to Greece in the days ahead, as it cuts the risk of an immediate banking crisis. Tourists are already being advised to carry more paper money than normal. Just in case. My colleague Miles Brignall explains: Andrew Brown, from Post Office Travel Money said: \u201cLooking back to the last time that things reached a head in Greece in 2013, the short term impact was a lack of availability of cash at ATMs and a reluctance by shops and restaurants to accept credit or debit cards. \u201cWith that in mind, we are advising customers travelling to Greece in the coming weeks to be prepared and ensure that they budget carefully, taking enough cash in euros to see them through their holiday.\u201d Journalists in Athens have also heard that Greek banks are getting extra emergency liquidity, to cover the deposits they have been losing. Bloomberg confirms that the ECB has accepted Athens\u2019 request for more emergency liquidity. But again, they don\u2019t know if Greece got the full \u20ac3.5bn it asked for.... Reuters has just snapped that the ECB has raised the emergency funding cap for Greeks banks, quoting a banking source. But they don\u2019t say how much by..... Greek savers haven\u2019t suddenly become nervous, of course -- deposits have been falling since December (when the previous government called snap elections): Analysts at Capital Economics explain that Greece really, really needs extra liquidity from the ECB. An estimated \u20ac3bn has been taken out of the banking sector this week, including around \u20ac1bn yesterday.... Newsflash: The European Central Bank has reportedly ended its call on whether to grant Greece extra emergency liquidity to help its banks stay afloat...... That\u2019s via Bloomberg. The president of Cyprus Nikos Anastasiades has intervened on Greece\u2019s behalf, calling the German chancellor Angela Merkel. Our Athens correspondent Helena Smith says: Sources in Nicosia, the Cypriot capital, say president Anastasiades called the German leader, with whom he gets on well, at the request of the Greek president Prokopis Pavlopoulos. The phone call - details of which have filtered through this morning - was marked by a surprising appeal Angela Merkel is reported to have made almost right off the bat. \u201cTell Tsipras to stop insulting me and members of my government. I also have voters I have to convince, it\u2019s not just Mr Tsipras [who has them],\u201d the chancellor was quoted as saying, by a number of Greek media. Cyprus, which suffered the euro zone\u2019s first bail-in after its banking system collapsed back in 2013 - partly because of its exposure to Greece - has been keen to keep a distance from Athens. After faithfully implementing reforms the island nation is beginning to see the first signs of economic recovery. \u201cGiven that perceptions are everything they really want to keep a distance,\u201d an EU diplomat based in Nicosia told me. \u201cThey want to ensure that Cyprus is different, that there\u2019ll be no contagion [in the event of Greece exiting the euro zone] and so have been walking a very fine line between having a natural bond with Greece and keeping on board with the rest of the euro zone.\u201d Here\u2019s the latest Greek odds from UK bookmaker Paddy Power: 4/5: Greece to adopt an official currency other than the Euro by the end of 2017 6/5: European Commission to confirm that Greece has \u2018defaulted\u2019 on debt in 2015 9/4: Greece to hold another general election in 2015 2/1: Greece to exit the Eurozone this year Update: Reader Oli Hawkins flags up that you get better odds on Grexit elsewhere.... Here\u2019s how Greek papers are covering the crisis: Awkward... While we await the ECB\u2019s decision, here are some photos from inside today\u2019s meeting of European finance ministers: Angela Merkel\u2019s spokesman, Steffen Seibert, has said there is still time for a deal between Greece and its creditors. \u201cIt\u2019s not too late for this and of course we hope that such an agreement is possible.\u201d A German finance ministry spokeswoman has denied that EU leaders could decide to impose capital controls on Greece at Monday night\u2019s emergency summit. Capital controls are a decision for an individual country, she explained. The European Central Bank is about to begin deliberating whether to agree to Greece\u2019s request for more emergency assistance to keep the Greek banking sector running. It\u2019s official... eurozone finance ministers will meet again on Monday, at 3pm CET. That will allow them to prepare the ground before eurozone leaders meet on Monday night to discuss the Greek crisis. So, if Greece does come up with new proposals, as it was urged last night, they could be examined then. Greece\u2019s central bank has issued a statement this morning, in which it declares that the banking system remains stable. This meeting appears to have been aimed at mending fences between Stournaras and the leftist-led government, says our correspondent Helena Smith Earlier this week, the governing Syriza party accused Stournaras, a former finance minister in the previous pro-bailout conservative led government, of fear-mongering after warning in his annual report that failure to find a deal would push Greece into uncontrollable economic collapse. Over in Athens our correspondent Helena Smith has been speaking with bankers who say while the Bank of Greece has indeed requested a cash injection from the ECB today, bank officials are far from panicked - at this point. She writes: Bankers this morning are, if anything, in sanguine mood. The outflows Greek banks have seen in recent days have been limited to cash withdrawals mostly of small amounts. Transfers of large sums abroad have apparently not be seen. \u201cThose who had money to take out have taken it out,\u201d said one official speaking on condition of anonymity. \u201cWhat we have been seeing is cash outflows by depositors with small portfolios withdrawing amounts of between five and 10,000 euro. That has depleted reserves and meant bank buffers have to be reinforced,\u201d he told me this morning. \u201cIf there is any panic it is illusory. We haven\u2019t seen it.\u201d A lot of savers, he added, had elected not to break long-term deposit accounts. Echoing government insiders, finance sources rubbished suggestions of an imminent close-down of Greek lenders. Reports that banks might close on Monday \u201csimply didn\u2019t add up,\u201d said another banker. \u201cIt just doesn\u2019t make sense that when they have proclaimed an emergency EU summit to try and end this highly volatile situation banks don\u2019t open. I really don\u2019t think that is going to happen.\u201d Russia is ready to look at financial aid for Greece, according to its deputy prime minister today. Arkady Dvorkovich, Russia\u2019 s deputy prime minister, told an audience of Russian business leaders today that Russia was ready to consider financial help - contradicting statements from the finance ministry only yesterday that the Kremlin couldn\u2019t afford to help. Dvorkovich said: \u201cWe support any decision [to resolve the Greek debt crisis] that will be proposed by Greece and our European partners. The first priority for us our investment projects and trade with Greece. If financial support is required we will look at this question.\u201d \u201cThe priority for us is a stable Europe and a stable Greece. We will support all possible means to resolve the Greek debt crisis.\u201d He said that many countries, Greece included, wanted to lift European sanctions against Russia as soon as possible. \u201cThese countries think about business, about the private economy and not about politics. We think that this is a constructive approach.\u201d He said the Russian government would definitely be consulting more with countries that support lifting sanctions, than those that do \u201cnot want to continue economic dialogue\u201d. However on Thursday Russia\u2019s deputy finance minister Sergei Storchak said that Greece had not applied for financial aid and that Russia did not have budgetary resources to help. Greek officials, including prime minister Alexis Tsipras, are on a visit to Russia today. Earlier, they signed a \u2018joint memorandum\u2019 to extend the planned Turkish Stream gas pipeline to Europe, with Russian state development bank VEB providing funding. There\u2019s not too much love for Greece from fellow eurozone member Slovakia today. Prime minister Robert Fico told a press conference in Bratislava that his government are ready for Greece to leave the eurozone, although he\u2019s rather it didn\u2019t happen. As Fico put it: \u201cWe wish for Greece to remain in the euro zone but not at any cost\u201d. \u201cSlovakia is prepared mentally and technically for the crisis scenario of Greece exiting the euro zone. We will insist on Greece doing its homework,\u201d French president Francois Hollande sounds a little more supportive, telling another press conference today that: \u201cIt is very important that talks continue and this discussion reaches a compromise solution and that compromise solution must be according to European rules.\u201d My colleague Jon Henley is in the Greek capital today. He reports that Athenians are nervous, but not hysterical about the threat of a bank run. Jon writes: It was not what anyone would call a panic: the banks were all open, the cashpoints were dispensing notes, the cafes were busy, the sesame-seed bagel stands doing a brisk morning trade. But as rumours swirled of multi-billion euro cash injections and possible bank closures by Monday, a steady stream of people \u2013 though never enough to call queue \u2013 were withdrawing money from the National Bank branch on Athens\u2019 central Syntagma Square. \u201cYes, I\u2019m worried,\u201d said Dimitris, who works for an insurance company and, given that he had just taken out \u20ac1,000 in 50-euro notes, was understandably reluctant to supply a surname. \u201cI\u201dm worried because this is now starting to get really very uncertain indeed. The government is not telling us what it will do, how it intends to solve this thing. I am making sure I have enough for the first part of next week. Just in case.\u201d With the headline in Friday\u2019s Kathimerini newspaper warning that the Bank of Greece had asked the European Central Bank for \u20ac3.5bn of emergency funding to shore up some \u20ac3.2bn of deposits that have haemmorhaged from Greece\u2019s largest since Monday, some customers were holding back out of principle. \u201cI don\u2019t feel 100% secure, that\u2019s certainly true,\u201d said Giota Georgiades, who works for a timber and paper import agency. \u201cBut I don\u2019t want to take all I have out of the bank. If everyone did that, the whole banking system would collapse.\u201d Like almost everyone at the cashpoint, Georgiades \u2013 who had withdrawn just \u20ac30, \u201cenough for today and maybe tomorrow\u201d \u2013 said she was confident a way out would be found from her country\u2019s face-off with its creditors: its eurozone partners, the European Central Bank and the International Monetary Fund. Jon\u2019s full report will be online shortly... Greeks friends on Twitter are keeping their spirits up: Greek government bond yields are dropping this morning, suggesting that traders are slightly less worried about a default. The yield on two-year Greek debt has dropped to 28.6%, from 30.4% last night. Yields show the rate of return on a bond, and rise when the price falls (and vice versa). So a dip in yields is a sign of higher confidence. HOWEVER. Greek yields do remain extremely high -- Athens certainly couldn\u2019t issue any new debt at such high interest rates. I\u2019m not seeing or hearing any signs of panic at Greek banks today, despite Kathimerini\u2019s report that \u20ac1.2bn was taken out yesterday. One bank official has told Reuters: \u201cThere are no lines or panic, it has been a quiet and gradual phase of withdrawals. \u201cThey are due to worries whether a deal will be clinched with the country\u2019s lenders.\u201d Reassuring news from the Athens stock market. The main ATG index has risen a little in early trading, up nearly 0.5%. Shares in the major banks are up around 2%. That suggests investors are holding their nerve, and believe savers are doing the same.... UK chancellor George Osborne has urged Athens to reach a deal with its lenders. Arriving at today\u2019s meeting of finance ministers, he says: We have entered the eleventh hour of this Greek crisis and we urge the Greek government to do a deal before it is too late. We hope for the best, but we now must be prepared for the worst. Britain has \u201ctaken measures\u201d to increase economic security to handle risks from abroad, he adds. A reporter asks Osborne what \u201cthe worst\u201d is, but I don\u2019t think he replies before vanishing into today\u2019s meeting. There is a total absence of panic in the European stock markets in early trading: The Athens market opens in a few minutes.... EU finance ministers are arriving back in Luxembourg -- and sounding downbeat about Greece. Greece\u2019s prime minister has welcomed the decision to call an emergency summit on Monday night. In a statement, Alexis Tsipras declared that Greece will reach a solution that will allow it to stay in the euro area and return to growth: \u201c\u03a4he (euro zone) leaders summit on Monday is a positive development on the road toward a deal. \u201cAll those who are betting on crisis and terror scenarios will be proven wrong. There will be a solution based on respecting EU rules and democracy which would allow Greece to return to growth in the euro\u201d These charts show how Greek deposit levels have fallen steadily this year, prompting the ECB to steadily provide more and more emergency liquidity. Greek newspaper Kathimerini reports that the Bank of Greece has asked the ECB for another \u20ac3.5bn of emergency funding, to handle the deposit flight. It also says that \u20ac1.2bn was taken out of banks on Thursday, on top of the \u20ac2bn between Monday and Wednesday. More here: Bank of Greece asks ECB for extra cash flow via ELA Today\u2019s ECB session comes just two days after it extended another \u20ac1.1bn of emergency liquidity to the Greek banking sector. But the fear is that funds are leaving banks faster than the ECB can put them in. Especially after ECB executive Beno\u00eet C\u0153ur\u00e9 told yesterday\u2019s meeting that he didn\u2019t know if Greek banks would be able to open on Monday. The AFP newswire has more details of the European Central Bank\u2019s emergency meeting: The European Central Bank\u2019s decision-making governing council will hold an emergency session Friday to discuss a request from the Bank of Greece for an increase in liquidity to Greek banks, sources familiar with the matter told AFP. The council will hold a teleconference at around midday (1000 GMT) to discuss a possible increase in the Emergency Liquidity Assistance facility, as deposit withdrawals from Greek banks have accelerated in recent days, sources said, speaking on condition of anonymity. An ECB spokesman declined to comment. Good morning. More than five years after it began, Greece\u2019s debt crisis is rattling towards a climax after finance ministers failed to make any progress towards a deal last night. And with deposits leaving its banks at a faster rate this week, Europe could be facing a full-blown banking crisis: As we covered in yesterday\u2019s liveblog, EU leaders will take on the responsibility for tackling the crisis, when they hold an emergency summit on Monday evening. That was triggered by growing fears over Greece\u2019s banking sector, we understand, after over \u20ac2bn was taken out between Monday and Wednesday: And the sight of pro-EU demonstrators protesting against the government\u2019s stance last night has shown we are entering a new phase in this long crisis. So what happens today? The European Central Bank will hold an emergency meeting to discuss whether to extend more emergency liquidity to Greece\u2019s banks, to allow them to keep running as savers withdraw their That meeting is scheduled for 11am BST, or 1pm Greek time, according to Bloomberg TV. There could be more action in Luxembourg today, where European finance ministers will be holding further meetings. Not about Greece, though, but I think we can guess what they\u2019ll be chatting about over the orange juice and croissants. The press pack are poised for action: Greece\u2019s prime minister Alexis Tsipras is (I think) still in Russia. He was due to meet with President Vladimir Putin at some point. But the big question is how the Greek people, battered by years of deadlock, austerity and division, respond to the latest developments which are dominating the front pages.... We\u2019ll be tracking all the main events through the day...",

      "bodyText": "The news that Gap is to shut 175 of its 675 North American stores, as well as a number of European branches, underlines just how much the fashion industry has changed since the US chain\u2019s 1990s heyday. When Alanis Morissette was on the radio and Friends was on TV, Gap\u2019s chinos and khaki combats were an essential part of a fashionable wardrobe. \u201cGap provided customers with a uniform, which worked so well for Generation X,\u201d says Bernadette Kissane, apparel and footwear analyst at Euromonitor International. \u201cGap innovated constantly \u2013 with product and also with marketing, being the first fashion company to run TV advertisements. The Gap uniform became so trendy that celebrities wore it, too.\u201d The high street was very different then. In Britain, Topshop and H&amp;M had yet to be rejuvenated. Zara and Primark were not churning out copies of trends, while the Japanese high-performance wear of Uniqlo and sexy Californian spandex of American Apparel had yet to become ubiquitous. The Scandi minimalism of Cos was but a twinkle in H&amp;M\u2019s eye. Over the past 10 years, those brands have parked their tanks on Gap\u2019s lawn, and the US chain has failed to meaningfully defend itself. While the emerging brands have been clear about their unique selling points, Gap\u2019s identity has become muddied. \u201cThe key problem is that they have not innovated with product,\u201d says Kissane. \u201cIt also feels as though neither they or their consumer know exactly who they are targeting.\u201d Gap was founded in San Francisco in 1969, the brainchild of husband-and-wife team Donald and Doris Fisher, to sell Levi jeans and LPs. It was an immediate success, expanded rapidly across the US and started selling own-brand clothing in the 1970s. But it was under chief executive Millard \u201cMickey\u201d Drexler in the 1990s that the Gap really took off. Sweatshirts with the Gap logo became ubiquitous, the brand went on TV and Gap\u2019s American casual became a trademark look. The shares hit $52. Towards the end of the decade, however, the retailer ran out of steam. In 2002 Drexler was fired and the shares dipped to just $8. He went on to run J Crew, and has turned it into an upmarket US brand with a loyal following and celebrity fans including Michelle Obama and Jake Gyllenhaal. In the post-Drexler era at Gap, however, senior executives have come and gone. The latest chief executive, Art Peck, took over last autumn, and he has work to do: a trading update released last month shows the Gap brand\u2019s sales over the first quarter were down 10% on last year\u2019s levels. In April they were down 15% on 2014. In May they were down 6%. Banana Republic \u2013 also owned by Gap, has similar problems. The shares are standing at $38 \u2013 well short of their peak in 2000. In 2012 Gap sought to address its problems by hiring creative director Rebekah Bay \u2013 the driving force behind Cos. But the quiet, nuanced designs that had worked for the sophisticated customers at Cos did not translate worldwide. In January this year, Bay left and Gap scrapped the creative director position entirely, replacing it with a far more corporate-sounding role \u2013 executive vice-president, Gap product design and development. For David Watts, a fashion industry adviser, this was a huge mistake. \u201cHaving a strong creative vision is absolutely crucial. It feels like Gap could not find the right person so instead they did away with the role; that suggests a problem with the management more than the brand.\u201d Watts believes that as Gap became a mega-brand its bureaucratic processes have become slow and complex, and those issues have trickled right down to the shop floor. \u201cI recently went to Gap for the first time in a long time,\u201d he says, \u201cand it was the most depressing retail experience I\u2019ve had in a very long time. The lighting, the fixtures, the scratched floorboards \u2013 everything was dull. There was nothing I was inspired to pick up.\u201d Certainly, the subdued Gap shopping experience feels nothing like stepping into Topshop or Urban Outfitters \u2013 where music pumps and lights are bright. Yet it is millennials, or Generation Y (those born between the 1980s and the 2000s), that most analysts believe Gap needs to attract. \u201cThat\u2019s where most of the disposable money and the customer base and the interest in fashion is right now,\u201d says Kissane. \u201cBut millennials\u2019 concept of value is very different to Generation X. They expect trends far more quickly and cheaply than Gap has been delivering them.\u201d Oddly enough, many of the ideas that made Gap so popular 20 years ago \u2013 understatement, androgyny, clothes as uniform \u2013 are bang on trend right now, seen at designers ranging from Alexander Wang to Celine. The street style version of this trend has been described as normcore \u2013 wearing anti-trend, anti-label clothes of the type favoured by unlikely style inspirations such as Larry David and Jerry Seinfeld, in an ironic way. Gap dipped a toe in the normcore waters late last year with its Dress Normal campaign, featuring celebrities including Anjelica Houston and Mad Men\u2019s Elisabeth Moss. Normcore clothes are styled with irony \u2013 oversized shirts; wilfully nerdy trousers cut off awkwardly at the ankle. Gap\u2019s watered down version was just, well, normal, and came a good nine months after the idea of normcore had captured the internet\u2019s imagination. In the digital age, nine months is an incredibly long time. Being fleet of foot is a significant challenge for a giant like Gap. The company has pledged that its streamlined operation will be a lot faster to react to trends. While the store closures are terrible news for thousands of employees, Kissane believes they will help bring the chain into line with the demands of the modern age: \u201cIn 2014, internet sales made up 13% of global apparel retailing; in 2009 that was just 5%, so that is growing really rapidly,\u201d she says. Now what Gap needs is excellent product and a brand message so loud and clear it can be heard clearly worldwide. As others have pointed out this week Gap\u2019s problem is that it has become the very thing millennials detest: \u201cbasic\u201d \u2013 the internet generation\u2019s favourite insult right now, meaning boring, clich\u00e9d, blah. It\u2019s a word even most of those born before 1980 are now familiar with, since Kate Moss hurled the diss at the pilot on her easyJet flight. While the Croydon supermodel may be be generation X to her core, she has at least mastered the essentials of generation Y\u2019s lingo. If Gap really is to put millennials at the heart of its business plan, the least it needs to do is follow suit. This article was amended on 22 June 2015. It originally quoted the apparel analyst Bernadette Kissane as saying internet sales made up 13% of Gap\u2019s sales in 2014, compared with 5% in 2009. Kissane was referring to the figures for global apparel retailing, not Gap sales. This has been corrected.",

Yet it is millennials, or Generation Y (those born between the 1980s and the 2000s), that most analysts believe Gap needs to attract. \u201cThat\u2019s where most of the disposable money and the customer base and the interest in fashion is right now,\u201d says Kissane. \u201cBut millennials\u2019 concept of value is very different to Generation X. They expect trends far more quickly and cheaply than Gap has been delivering them.\u201d</p> <p>Oddly enough, many of the ideas that made Gap so popular 20 years ago \u2013 understatement, androgyny, clothes as uniform \u2013 are bang on trend right now, seen at designers ranging from Alexander Wang to Celine. </p> <p>The street style version of this trend has been described as normcore \u2013 wearing anti-trend, anti-label clothes of the type favoured by unlikely style inspirations such as Larry David and Jerry Seinfeld, in an ironic way. </p> <p></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/fashion/fashion-blog/2014/feb/27/normcore-the-next-big-fashion-movement\">Normcore: the next big fashion movement?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Gap dipped a toe in the normcore waters late last year with its Dress Normal campaign, featuring celebrities including Anjelica Houston and Mad Men\u2019s Elisabeth Moss. Normcore clothes are styled with irony \u2013 oversized shirts; wilfully nerdy trousers cut off awkwardly at the ankle. Gap\u2019s watered down version was just, well, normal, and came a good nine months after the idea of normcore had <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/fashion/fashion-blog/2014/feb/27/normcore-the-next-big-fashion-movement\">captured the internet\u2019s imagination</a>. In the digital age, nine months is an incredibly long time. </p> <p>Being fleet of foot is a significant challenge for a giant like Gap. The company has pledged that its streamlined operation will be a lot faster to react to trends. While the store closures are terrible news for thousands of employees, Kissane believes they will help bring the chain into line with the demands of the modern age: \u201cIn 2014, internet sales made up 13% of global apparel retailing; in 2009 that was just 5%, so that is growing really rapidly,\u201d she says. Now what Gap needs is excellent product and a brand message so loud and clear it can be heard clearly worldwide.</p> <p>As <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/jun/15/gap-closing-175-stores-normcore\">others have pointed out this week</a> Gap\u2019s problem is that it has become the very thing millennials detest: <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2015/jun/08/kate-moss-called-pilot-basic-bitch-witness\">\u201cbasic\u201d</a> \u2013 the internet generation\u2019s favourite insult right now, meaning boring, clich\u00e9d, blah. It\u2019s a word even most of those born before 1980 are now familiar with, since Kate Moss hurled the diss at the pilot on her easyJet flight. </p> <p>While the Croydon supermodel may be be generation X to her core, she has at least mastered the essentials of generation Y\u2019s lingo. If Gap really is to put millennials at the heart of its business plan, the least it needs to do is follow suit.</p> <ul> <li>This article was amended on 22 June 2015. It originally quoted the apparel analyst Bernadette Kissane as saying internet sales made up 13% of Gap\u2019s sales in 2014, compared with 5% in 2009. Kissane was referring to the figures for global apparel retailing, not Gap sales. This has been corrected.<br></li> </ul>",

The Wall Street bank is replacing US rival JP Morgan in advising UK Financial Investments, the body which looks after the taxpayer stakes in the bailed-out banks.

Goldman is also thought to be among the bidders for a portfolio of mortgages that Northern Rock is now selling off to help repay its loan to the taxpayer. Goldman\u2019s appointment follows the announcement by George Osborne that he is to begin selling off the government\u2019s 79% stake in RBS, seven years after the bailout, even though the shares are worth less than the taxpayer paid for them at the time. The stake was valued at \u00a345bn seven years ago but is now worth \u00a332bn, according to analysis by bankers at Rothschild for the chancellor. Selling off the entire RBS stake is expected to take years, Osborne has said, but could include an offering to retail investors. In the runup to the general election in May, the Conservatives pledged to carve out a parcel of the remaining stake in Lloyds to sell to the public at a discount. RBS is said to be appointing Bank of America Merrill Lynch as a new corporate broker, a key role for firms in the City as they help facilitate discussions with shareholders.

Customers of RBS, NatWest and Ulster were affected. An RBS spokesperson said on Friday: \u201cWe can confirm that the issues customers were experiencing in relation to delayed credits and debits have now been resolved and accounts have been updated.\u201d \u201cWe are extremely sorry for the inconvenience and distress that this has caused our customers.

We will continue our work to make sure that no customer will be left out of pocket as a result of this issue.\u201d MP Andrew Tyrie, the chair of the Treasury select committee, is writing to the RBS chief executive, Ross McEwan, for reassurance that such incidents cannot keep happening. The bank had originally warned it might take until Saturday for the situation to be resolved, and during a presentation to analysts and investors on Thursday had admitted it could not rule out other IT failures taking place again. Simon McNamara, RBS\u2019s chief administrative officer, said: \u201cI\u2019d love to say we will never have a technical failing again.

The Financial Conduct Authority said it had been working with RBS to check how the bank had handled this week\u2019s problem, but added it was too early to say whether there would be an investigation. McNamara said RBS had learned lessons from the previous IT meltdown and applied them to resolve the latest one, which was caused by the bank being unable to process a file of payments. RBS was unable to say how much the problem had cost following its promise to ensure no customers had been left out of pocket, although it was another dent to its reputation. The bank has been fined for rigging Libor and foreign exchange markets and is braced for a multibillion pound settlement because of the way it sold mortgage bonds before the finanical crisis.

The bank has been fined for rigging Libor and foreign exchange markets and is braced for a multibillion pound settlement because of the way it sold mortgage bonds before the finanical crisis.</p> <p>In an effort to bolster its reputation, a branch of NatWest is Huddersfield is throwing open its doors to a BBC documentary.

      "bodyText": "You, dear reader, are a prolific and casual user of offshore tax havens. I\u2019m assuming you don\u2019t live in a cave or in a remote hunting community. Even if you did, though, you\u2019re probably a dabbler: you have little choice. Many people, and perhaps you\u2019re one of them, share a queasy feeling that something has gone badly wrong with the world economy \u2013 but can\u2019t quite put their finger on what the source of the trouble is. Once you understand the nature of offshore tax havens, you should feel closer to pinning down the answers. Before I explain what they are, and why powerful governments don\u2019t just close them down, I want you to take part in a short challenge. See if you can dodge all my bear traps, and declare yourself untainted by tax havens. If you succeed, you win my Hermit of the Year prize. Do you celebrate Christmas? If you do (or even if you do not), did you buy any gifts on Amazon last December? If so, then your goods were quite likely to have been routed through a byzantine world hosted \u2013 only on paper, you understand \u2013 by the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg, where Amazon has located its European headquarters, slashing its tax bills around the world. In 2011, Amazon revealed that the US Internal Revenue Service was chasing it for $1.5bn in back taxes. More recently, Amazon has said it will stop routing its UK sales through Luxembourg. Perhaps you shun Amazon. You buy only local products: good for you. But did you search for any gifts online? Did a company called Google play any role in this? In 2011, Google shuffled four-fifths of its profits through a subsidiary in the tax haven of Bermuda, cutting its worldwide tax rate in half and its tax rate in some countries to nearly zero. Google boss Eric Schmidt said in 2012 he was \u201cvery proud of the structure that we set up\u2026 it\u2019s called capitalism\u201d. You\u2019ve never used Google? OK, let\u2019s say you did all your shopping in the real world: traipsing around your local stores, picking up homemade wooden artefacts that you could weigh in your hands. Wonderful. You\u2019re nearly there. But not quite. Did you listen to any music on those days? Let\u2019s hope iTunes wasn\u2019t part of that picture. The tech giant Apple achieved what Senator Carl Levin called, in 2013, the \u201choly grail\u201d of tax avoidance, setting up offshore corporations legally incorporated in Ireland and the US \u2013 but for tax purposes, not resident anywhere. Apple shifted $74bn into one of these subsidiaries between 2009 and 2012, paying 2% in tax on it. Let\u2019s cut this challenge short. Did you at any point consume the services of any of these: AIG, Aviva, Barclays, Black &amp; Decker, British American Tobacco, Burberry, Citigroup, Deutsche Bank, Facebook, FedEx, GlaxoSmithKline, Ikea, HSBC, JP Morgan, Microsoft, Pepsi, Skype, Starbucks, Vodafone or Walt Disney? This is just my quirky personal selection from a list of more than 350 multinationals whose convoluted tax schemes were revealed last November by a whistleblower, working for one accountancy firm, PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC), in one European tax haven, Luxembourg. The revelation provoked a scandal that has become known as Luxleaks, involving tens of thousands of documents, a whole menagerie of Luxembourg-based tax schemes. What happened, as a result? Three people are currently being pursued by the courts, accused of violating trade secrecy: the main whistleblower, a diffident and bespectacled 28-year-old Frenchman named Antoine Deltour; a second, anonymous whistleblower; and a French journalist, Edouard Perrin (who first helped publicise the leaked data and is being pursued as an accomplice). It should be noted that everything these companies are doing is legal: it\u2019s what we call tax avoidance or planning \u2013 not evasion. But the point I want to make is that tax havens are everywhere. It\u2019s like The Matrix. I can\u2019t stress strongly enough how everywhereish they are. And, until recently, who even noticed? Tax havens\u2019 defenders say they smooth the flow of capital around the world, removing roadblocks and red tape. But what are those roadblocks? Taxes, regulation and democratic laws. Havens are places where you can put your wealth in order to escape the rules at home. Those rules might be around tax, or criminal laws, or rules about transparency and disclosure, or financial regulations. (It\u2019s not always about the tax.) You don\u2019t have to put your wealth itself in the tax haven. It is the legal structure that owns the wealth \u2013 the shell company, the trust, or whatever \u2013 that usually matters. The asset itself \u2013 the thing you own \u2013 can be anything, anywhere. It could be a painting or a Learjet or a Swiss bank account, or a luxury home in Mayfair that the owner \u2013 let\u2019s say a Ukrainian oligarch \u2013 is currently using for the benefit of his daughter. Instead of owning the house directly, the oligarch owns the house via an intermediate structure in a tax haven. The land registry records won\u2019t list the oligarch\u2019s name, but the name of some anonymous offshore shell company. And when you go to find out who owns that company, you\u2019ll come up against a brick wall. This can all take a bit of getting used to, even for people with wealth. When Hurricane Ivan headed towards the Cayman Islands in 2004, it sent a stream of light aircraft racing to Miami. They contained computer hard disks, relating to a large slice of the world\u2019s Cayman-held wealth. (Banking assets in Cayman account for nearly a 15th of the world\u2019s $30tn in banking assets.) When the storm passed, they flew them all back again. There are many tricks used to shift money offshore, and a pinstriped army of accountants and lawyers to help people do it. The commonest technique is one called transfer pricing, employed by pretty much every multinational. This is how it works. Let\u2019s say a corporation picks and packs a container-load of bananas in Ecuador, and it costs the company $1,000. It sells them to a French supermarket for $3,000. Which country gets to tax the $2,000 profit \u2013 France, Ecuador? The answer is, \u201cWhere the multinational\u2019s accountants decide.\u201d The multinational sets up three companies, all of which it owns: EcuadorCo, HavenCo (in a zero-tax haven) and FranceCo. EcuadorCo sells the container to HavenCo for $1,000, and HavenCo sells it on to FranceCo for $3,000. That\u2019s basically it. (The bananas themselves don\u2019t go anywhere near the tax haven: this is all just paper-shuffling in New York or London.) If you blinked, you may have missed what happened here. It cost EcuadorCo $1,000 to pick and pack the container, and they sold it on for $1,000. So EcuadorCo records zero profits, meaning no taxes. Likewise, FranceCo buys it for $3,000 and sells it to the supermarket for $3,000. Again, no profits, and no taxes. HavenCo is the key to the puzzle. It bought the container for $1,000 and sold it for $3,000 \u2013 a $2,000 profit. But it is based in a haven, so it pays no tax. In short, all the profits have been stripped out of France and Ecuador, and shovelled into the haven. Hey presto! In the real world, things are more complicated. Countries put in place defences against this kind of nonsense, but the lawyers find ways to get around them, in a constant game of cat and mouse. These games transfer wealth from taxpayers towards corporate shareholders. This isn\u2019t about creating wealth, but about one group of people extracting wealth from another group. These transactions boost inequality, every time. They also help multinationals outcompete their smaller and more local competitors. Tax havens aren\u2019t the only reason your local bookstore has gone out of business \u2013 but they are a big part of it. (Note, too, that these are not \u201cleftist\u201d concerns. Tax havens are tilting the playing field for business: people across the political spectrum should oppose this. To be anti-tax haven is, in a very profound sense, to be pro-business.) And let\u2019s not forget all the criminality that tax haven secrecy facilitates. When multinationals use these platforms, they provide these places with immense political cover. Again, this should worry people on both the left and the right. It is, really, a fight between a globetrotting elite, in one corner, versus ordinary people in rich and poor countries \u2013 who all have a shared interest in tackling these problems. Nothing illegal has necessarily happened here; to focus only on who broke the law and who didn\u2019t is to miss the big picture \u2013 which is, who got the cream and who didn\u2019t. Around a decade ago, I was writing a book about six countries along a stretch of west Africa\u2019s oil-soaked coast, running from Angola up to Nigeria. Despite hundreds of billions of dollars in oil revenues, their people didn\u2019t seem to be better off. In the case of Angola, then just starting to recover from an oil- and diamond-fuelled war, it was surely worse off than if no natural resources had been discovered. I wrote an article about corruption in west Africa\u2019s oil-producing states, and a few days later got a letter from David Spencer, a US attorney who had worked with a big global bank in Latin America. He invited me to visit him in New York. Several months later we met and, before we had finished our starters, Spencer was getting worked up about matters that were not at all on my agenda: accounting rules, US tax exemptions, transfer pricing \u2013 and some curious legal arrangements in Delaware, a small US state roughly halfway between New York and Washington. What on earth did any of this have to do with Nigeria? Realisation began to dawn: Spencer was telling me that the US was itself a giant tax haven, and that this was intensely relevant for west Africa. He explained why. During the Vietnam war, the US was spending more money overseas than it was earning there, and dollars were flowing out. To finance its growing deficit, the US wanted to lure foreign dollars back home. It did this by turning itself into a haven: creating tax benefits for foreigners. The idea was to start hoovering up capital flight and dirty money from around the world; looted west African oil money would do nicely. So the US has been fighting hard against foreign tax havens, to crack down on its own tax cheats. At the same time the US is a big part of the world\u2019s problem, with Wall Street banks profiting from American willingness to help foreign tax cheats. Britain\u2019s own array of satellite havens \u2013 the Cayman Islands, British Virgin Islands, Bermuda, Jersey, all of which sport the Queen on their banknotes \u2013 are part of the same problem. From my meeting with Spencer, I took away two big thoughts. First, that tax havens weren\u2019t where I thought they were. The US, a tax haven? In those days, nobody was pointing that out. Second, this was no exotic criminal sideshow to the global economy, as I had assumed \u2013 it was a much bigger phenomenon than I had ever imagined. This was interesting. I was hooked.

Still in the sector Ocado has added 2.2p to 386p despite a sell note from Deutsche Bank: Ocado is due to report first half results on 30 June. Since signing its first joint venture with Morrisons two years ago, the focus of Ocado\u2019s next potential licensing deal has narrowed in on the US grocery market and given management\u2019s target to sign its first \u201cOcado Smart Platform\u201d client in 2015, confirmation of being on or off track in this regard, is likely to be as big a share price driver as the results themselves. In terms of the results, we expect Ocado\u2019s UK retail business to come under increasing gross margin pressure as the Big 4 continue to invest in prices and find it difficult to place a higher value on the licensing business, when the profitability of the underlying retail business remains unproven.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "George Osborne is on track to cut the annual budget deficit by more than previously forecast after a block on spending and a jump in tax receipts in May. The Office for National Statistics said government borrowing last month dropped to \u00a310.1bn, the lowest since 2007, from \u00a312.3bn in May last year \u2013 an 18% fall. The total stock of debt, excluding public sector banks, was \u00a31.5tn or 80.8% of GDP, an increase of \u00a383.2bn compared with May 2014. Income tax and VAT receipts increased by more than 5% while government spending rose by just 0.1%. The government\u2019s already diminished investment budget was reduced by 8.7% to \u00a3200m, the ONS said. The fall in the monthly budget deficit means the government could beat the prediction of a 14% drop in the annual deficit in this financial year made by the Office for Budget Responsibility. However, the chancellor is expected to press ahead with steep cuts to welfare budgets and Whitehall in his budget on 8 July. A Treasury spokesman said: \u201cWe have more than halved the deficit, but at just under 5% it is still one of the highest in the developed world. We\u2019ve learnt that there is no shortcut to fixing the public finances. \u201cSo that is why we will bring forward a strong new fiscal framework at the budget to entrench a permanent commitment to run a budget surplus in normal times, and the budget responsibility it represents,\u201d he said. Alan Clarke, UK economist at Scotia Bank, said that any plaudits for the chancellor should be muted by figures that were largely based on forecasts rater than actual cash in and out of the government\u2019s ledger book. He said: \u201cClearly things could prove to have been front-loaded and the good performance could taper off. But the message is \u201cso far so good\u201d. He added: \u201cIf we can\u2019t generate good public finance numbers now when we have robust growth and falling unemployment, when can we?\u201d Howard Archer, chief economist at IHS Global Insight said that nevertheless, the figures were a boost for the chancelor ahead of the budget. He said: \u201cThe public finances saw further appreciable year-on-year improvement in May, thereby extending the positive start to fiscal year 2015/16. In fact, at \u00a310.1bn the May shortfall was the smallest for the month since 2007. \u201cMay\u2019s improvement meant that public sector net borrowing excluding banks amounted to \u00a316.4bn in the first two months of fiscal year 2015/16, which was down 23.6% from \u00a321.4 billion in April/May 2014,\u201d he said. Paul Hollingsworth, UK economist at Capital Economics, also said it was encouraging that total current receipts were 4.1% higher than last year, above the 3.2% rise the OBR expects for the fiscal year as a whole. \u201cNonetheless, with a long way to go in order to restore the public finances to better health, a major re-intensification of the fiscal squeeze is looming,\u201d he said.",

      "body": "<p>George Osborne is on track to cut the annual budget deficit by more than previously forecast after a block on spending and a jump in tax receipts in May.</p> <p>The Office for National Statistics said government borrowing last month dropped to \u00a310.1bn, the lowest since 2007, from \u00a312.3bn in May last year \u2013 an 18% fall. The total stock of debt, excluding public sector banks, was \u00a31.5tn or 80.8% of GDP, an increase of \u00a383.2bn compared with May 2014.<br></p> <p>Income tax and VAT receipts increased by more than 5% while government spending rose by just 0.1%. The government\u2019s already diminished investment budget was reduced by 8.7% to \u00a3200m, the ONS said.</p> <p>The fall in the monthly budget deficit means the government could beat the prediction of a 14% drop in the annual deficit in this financial year made by the Office for Budget Responsibility.<br></p> <p>However, the chancellor is expected to press ahead with steep cuts to welfare budgets and Whitehall in his budget on 8 July.</p> <p>A Treasury spokesman said: \u201cWe have more than halved the deficit, but at just under 5% it is still one of the highest in the developed world. We\u2019ve learnt that there is no shortcut to fixing the public finances. </p> <p>\u201cSo that is why we will bring forward a strong new fiscal framework at the budget to entrench a permanent commitment to run a budget surplus in normal times, and the budget responsibility it represents,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Alan Clarke, UK economist at Scotia Bank, said that any plaudits for the chancellor should be muted by figures that were largely based on forecasts rater than actual cash in and out of the government\u2019s ledger book.</p> <p>He said: \u201cClearly things could prove to have been front-loaded and the good performance could taper off. But the message is \u201cso far so good\u201d. </p> <p>He added: \u201cIf we can\u2019t generate good public finance numbers now when we have robust growth and falling unemployment, when can we?\u201d</p> <p> Howard Archer, chief economist at IHS Global Insight said that nevertheless, the figures were a boost for the chancelor ahead of the budget.<br></p> <p>He said: \u201cThe public finances saw further appreciable year-on-year improvement in May, thereby extending the positive start to fiscal year 2015/16. In fact, at \u00a310.1bn the May shortfall was the smallest for the month since 2007.</p> <p>\u201cMay\u2019s improvement meant that public sector net borrowing excluding banks amounted to \u00a316.4bn in the first two months of fiscal year 2015/16, which was down 23.6% from \u00a321.4 billion in April/May 2014,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Paul Hollingsworth, UK economist at Capital Economics, also said it was encouraging that total current receipts were 4.1% higher than last year, above the 3.2% rise the OBR expects for the fiscal year as a whole. </p> <p>\u201cNonetheless, with a long way to go in order to restore the public finances to better health, a major re-intensification of the fiscal squeeze is looming,\u201d he said.</p>",
