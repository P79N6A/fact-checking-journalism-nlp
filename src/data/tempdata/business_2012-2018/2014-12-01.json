      "bodyText": "The price of peace at BG Group is \u00a31.4m. That\u2019s the difference between the face value of incoming chief executive Helge Lund\u2019s original golden hello (\u00a312m) and the rejigged version (\u00a310.6m). The latter comes with tougher performance conditions so if, like BG, you prefer to talk about the \u201cexpected value\u201d of awards, the key numbers are \u00a310m and \u00a34.6m. Either way, the new deal falls within BG\u2019s agreed policy for new hires so there is no need for shareholders to vote at a general meeting. The quarrel with investors has been defused. The obvious question, though, is why BG chairman Andrew Gould and his boardroom colleagues ever thought plan A was a good idea or would survive shareholder scrutiny. It was obvious that a rebellion was on the cards. BG\u2019s board was ignoring a binding three-year pay policy that had been agreed with shareholders as recently as May. Its grounds for doing so were weak. Gould\u2019s argument was that Lund was an exceptional hire who would not come for anything less than \u00a312m as a signing-on carrot. That plea has now been exploded by Lund\u2019s willingness to accept a smaller sum. It rather looks as if Gould did not negotiate hard enough at the outset. Indeed, many will wonder why Lund was offered a golden hello of any size, even one that falls within agreed policy. Even by the yardstick of FTSE 100 chief executives running oil and gas giants, he has the chance to become extremely rich via the conventional elements of his pay package. He will get a \u00a31.5m salary; \u00a3450,000 a year for five years instead of a pension; an annual cash bonus of up to \u00a33m; and up to \u00a39m a year in long-term share awards. That lot adds up to a maximum \u00a314m a year if Lund hits his targets. If he does so, the value of his share-based awards would improve with BG\u2019s share price. So, at the maximum, he might clear \u00a380m for half a decade\u2019s work. That is not a pauper\u2019s rate. The only welcome development in this affair is that boards everywhere now know that a binding pay policy is indeed binding. Most, though, had surely understood the point already. Gould has now appointed one chief executive (Chris Finlayson) who was ditched after 15 months and created an unnecessary row over the pay arrangements for a second. It\u2019s not an impressive record. Normal form after a mishandled pay row dictates that the head of the remuneration committee should provide cover for boardroom colleagues by leaving quietly after a decent interval. Tough luck, Sir John Hood. JLIF\u2019s cheeky pitch In the world of construction and public-private assets such as hospitals, the polite fiction has always been that a \u201cdirectors\u2019 valuation\u201d of an infrastructure portfolio should be on the low side. The directors would argue this shows admirable conservatism on their part. A cynic would say the board wants a pat on the back every time it achieves the relatively simple task of selling an asset for more than book value. Either way, a \u00a31bn offer for a portfolio valued by the directors at \u00a31bn ought to be a non-starter. You can\u2019t blame John Laing Infrastructure Fund (JLIF) for making such a cheeky pitch to Balfour Beatty. It costs nothing to send a letter. And, after a string of profit warnings from the construction division, there is a slight chance that Balfour\u2019s shareholders might be sufficiently desperate to grab anything that looks like hard value for their collection of PFI assets. Yet JLIF\u2019s offer deserves a straightforward rejection. The price is too low. Balfour would be silly to sell before conducting an auction. And new chief executive, Leo Quinn, due to arrive at the start of January, deserves a say. Quinn, incidentally, should ask current employer Qinetiq for early release from his contract. JLIF, one suspects, may see advantage in putting its real offer on the table soon. It would be useful if Quinn were in position before then. Less than stressed The Co-op Bank doesn\u2019t seem to be too stressed about the idea that it will fail the stress tests the Bank of England is currently conducting on major UK lenders. Failure to meet desired capital ratios would \u201ccome as no surprise\u201d, it says. It sounds as if Niall Booker, chief executive, is expecting to receive a get-out card from Threadneedle Street in the form of more time to generate capital. Perhaps he will. But it would very odd if the Bank\u2019s Prudential Regulation Authority concludes that a fail carries no consequences. If the regulator thinks improvements at the Co-op Bank mean the lender is now capable of raising more capital from its shareholders why wouldn\u2019t it order it to act? Isn\u2019t that the point of stress tests?",

      "bodyText": "The loss-making Co-operative Bank is likely to fail the Bank of England\u2019s annual assessment of its financial strength, its chief executive has revealed. Niall Booker, who joined last year when the bank was on the brink of collapse, said it would \u201ccome as no surprise\u201d that it would struggle to pass Threadneedle Street\u2019s stress tests of leading banks and building societies. The results of the tests are scheduled for publication on 16 December but Booker was forced to clarify the position of the bank following a report in the Times. The Co-op, which has had to raise \u00a31.9bn of capital in the last 18 months, is thought to be hoping to avoid raising more as the Bank of England has already approved a five-year plan put together by Booker to reverse its fortunes. The high street lender reported a loss of \u00a31.3bn for 2013 and a loss of \u00a376m for the first six months of 2014 as it battled to keep customers in the face of series of scandals which forced the wider Co-operative Group of supermarkets and funeral homes to cede its overall control of the bank to hedge funds and other bondholders. The mutual\u2019s shareholding has fallen to 20%. The discovery of a capital shortfall last year was shortly followed by revelations about the bank\u2019s former chairman Paul Flowers who has since admitted drugs offences. An investigation is underway by the City regulator into the situation. Booker \u2013 who was paid \u00a31.7m in 2013 \u2013 has warned the bank will not make a profit until at least 2016 as he cuts staff and closes branches to save costs. In August, the bank made a little noticed disclosure in its interim results that when it subjected itself to its own stress test involving a once-in-25-years financial meltdown it fell below the minimum capital requirement set out by the regulator. Booker said: \u201cGiven the disclosures to the market in August, it will come as no surprise if the bank does not meet the desired capital ratios in the stress tests due to be announced in December.

Crombie, the 209-year-old company that clothed Cary Grant and John F Kennedy, will pay a six-figure sum to designer David Mason to use both the Tommy Nutter and the Nutters of Savile Row brands. Tommy Nutter took the fusty world of Savile Row into the pop era when he opened his first shop in 1969, creating a mannish suit for Bianca Jagger, putting Twiggy in a red velvet jacket and dressing three of the Beatles on the Abbey Road cover \u2013 only George Harrison preferred jeans. Aristocrats and pop stars flocked to Nutters on Savile Row in search of big lapels, nipped in waists and bold checks that would define the 1970s. The Tommy Nutter brand passed to Crombie following Nutter\u2019s death in 1992 at the age of 49. But, a legal battle erupted in 2010 when Crombie, which is owned by Conservative party vice chairman Alan Lewis, wanted to sell the brand to China\u2019s Fung family, which has been buying up the classic names of British bespoke tailoring. In 2013, the High Court ruled that Crombie\u2019s \u201cminimal\u201d use of the brand amounted to \u201cnon-use\u201d and awarded the rights to Nutters of Savile Row owner Mason. A hearing at the court of appeal set for Tuesday was averted at the 11th hour when the parties announced they had agreed that Crombie would have full ownership of both brands, in a deal that trademark experts believe to be worth hundreds of thousands of pounds. Mason will concentrate on his other brands, including Anthony Sinclair, Sean Connery\u2019s tailor during his stint as 007. This piece was edited on 4 December 2014 to correct some errors regarding the chain of ownership of the Tommy Nutter brand.",

In 2013, the High Court ruled that Crombie\u2019s \u201cminimal\u201d use of the brand amounted to \u201cnon-use\u201d and awarded the rights to Nutters of Savile Row owner Mason. </p> <p>A hearing at the court of appeal set for Tuesday was averted at the 11th hour when the parties announced they had agreed that Crombie would have full ownership of both brands, in a deal that trademark experts believe to be worth hundreds of thousands of pounds. Mason will concentrate on his other brands, including Anthony Sinclair, Sean Connery\u2019s tailor during his stint as 007.<br></p> <ul> <li>This piece was edited on 4 December 2014 to correct some errors regarding the chain of ownership of the Tommy Nutter brand. </li> </ul>",

      "bodyText": "And that\u2019s a good enough point to stop for the evening. The ruble appears to have stabilised at around 52 to the dollar, a slide of over 3% today. It was down 6.5% one stage, on track for its biggest one-day loss since the crisis of 1998. The intervention by the Bank of Russia appears to have calmed the situation, as do the comments from the central bank\u2019s deputy governor (details). The currency has still shed over 35% this year. The oil price is clinging on to its earlier gains, having hit five-year lows earlier. But shares in oil producers and exploration firms have fallen sharply again; the FTSE 100 ended down 66 points, its biggest fall in six weeks. Nick Fletcher\u2019s market report has the details: FTSE 100 suffers biggest daily fall since mid-October Scroll back through the blog for details of this morning\u2019s rather mixed economic data (factories in the US, UK and Spain did OK; those in the eurozone and China did not) I\u2019ll update the blog again remotely if anything serious happens. Otherwise, thanks, and goodnight. GW As so often in life, The Simpsons got there first.... The fluctuations in the oil price will have meant big profits, or losses, for speculators, and longer-term investors alike. The oil price lives to fight another day, it seems, now up over 2% after earlier tumbling by over 3%: Ksenia Yudaeva, the Russian central bank\u2019s deputy chairwoman, told Russian newswires today that Russian households should not panic over the ruble\u2019s slide. She said the recent hike in interest rates, to a chunky 9.5%, should encourage them not to convert savings into euros or dollars. She said: \u201cIt\u2019s necessary to explain to people that the yield they get on their deposits at the moment will guarantee a high degree of safety for their savings with regards to inflation. They should think twice before rushing out, losing the yield on their deposits, taking on currency risks and losing money on their currency conversions.\u201d (via the FT) French bank BNP Paribas has just lowered its forecasts for the the oil price over the next year, by up to $25 per barrel at one point That implies significant changes to inflation, consumer spending, and income for oil producers. Analysts at JP Morgan have added up all today\u2019s manufacturing PMI surveys from America, China, the Eurozone, the UK and beyond, and concluded that growth was the weakest since September 2013. Canada, the US, the UK and Japan all reported above-average growth, while China and the eurozone lagged. The ruble has been falling steadily since the the Ukraine crisis intensified over four months ago, when a Malaysian Airlines plane was shot down with the loss of 298 lives: The ruble is also clambering back off the mat, after its earlier pounding. Russia\u2019s currency is still down over 3% today, to around 51.8 to the dollar, having been down around 7% (!) earlier. That apparent intervention by the Central Bank of Russia appears to have stabilised the situation, at least for now... It\u2019s a topsy-turvy day \u2013 the oil price is now UP today, with both Brent crude and New York crude up over 1% now (to $67 and $71 per barrel respectively). It\u2019s a tentative bounce back, driven (I think) by the US dollar dropping in the foreign exchange markets. A weaker dollar generally pushes up the price of commodities priced in greenbacks, and also explains why gold has rallied today. Oil traders had hoped that the oil price would find a floor today, having dropped like a stone since Opec declined to cut production levels last Thursday. But the volatility is bad news for the ruble, as the Wall Street Journal explains: The slide in oil is \u201creinforcing the loss of investor confidence in the ruble,\u201d which has also been beset by concerns over Western sanctions against Russia and the conflict in Ukraine, said Lee Hardman, a currency strategist at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ. Back to Russia, and the ruble continues to be buffeted around. Fears of a deep recession, and the rout in the oil price this week, have sent the ruble down 5% today (see earlier summary for details). It\u2019s hovering around 52 rubles to the $1, having earlier been on track for its biggest one-day decline since 1998. AP reports that Ksenia Yudayeva, deputy chairman of the Russian Central Bank, told Russian news agencies on Monday there is enough currency liquidity in the market. Yudayeva added that the Central Bank has prepared new economic forecasts based on a price of $60 per barrel. They might be unpleasant reading, given Russia\u2019s oil industry needs a price around $100 to break even. Here comes the second measure of US manufacturing, from the Institute of Supply Management... And it confirms that the sector slowed a little in November, but still grew fairly strongly. The ISM\u2019s US factory PMI dipped to 58.7, from 59 last month -- which is a little better than expected. But the survey also shows that the prices paid by manufacturers fell last month, which is curious (suggesting firms were able to haggle hard in a low-flation environment) Back in Europe, the European Central Bank\u2019s new Asset-Backed Securities scheme has got off to a slow start. The ECB just announced that it bought less than \u20ac400m of ABSs last week; the latest stage in its attempt to fight off stagnation, or worse. Analysts aren\u2019t impressed with this meagre expansion of the ECB balance sheet: Markit reports that US factory output grew at its slowest rate since January, but still comfortably outpaced Europe Their US manufacturing PMI came in at 54.8, down on October\u2019s 55.9. Although that\u2019s the lowest reading since the start of the year, it still shows steady growth. It\u2019s also much better than the 50.1 recorded by the eurozone this morning, which is basically stagnation. We find out in 10 minutes whether the rival survey, by the ISM, agrees.... Gold keeps climbing.... it just touched $1,192 per ounce, up 2.2% today. Over in New York, shares have dipped in early trading as Wall Street traders get to work. The Dow Jones industrial average is down 54 points, or 0.3%. Weak manufacturing data this morning from China (details here) and Europe (and here) are weighing on the US market, as is news that retail spending over the Black Friday long weekend was down this year. In other commodities news, the gold price has been volatile today after Swiss voters rejected the proposals that its central banks should hold 20% of its total assets in bullion. The spot price of gold fell sharply in early trading, hitting a three week low below $1,143 per ounce. But it then recovered, hitting $1.182 per ounce this afternoon, up around $15/oz. c The bosses\u2019 protest in Paris comes as the French government prepares to unveil new legislation designed to stimulate growth and activity, later this month. Unions and left-leaning politicians fear that workers\u2019 rights and protections will be eroded. Over in Paris, hundreds of French bosses have held a protest to urge the goverment to cut tax and reduce red tape. Small business owners marched through the French capital. They carried banners with slogans such as \u201cTaxes, levies, charges: enough is enough\u201d, or calling for the end of the 35-hour maximum working week. It was organised by the CGPME union, which represents small and medium-sized business owners. It claims that excessive regulations and charges are holding them back. Some even carried locks and chains to symbolise their plight. Police put the turnout at 2,200, about half that estimated by CGPME. Interesting... the oil price has now clawed back this morning\u2019s selloff, which saw it hit fresh five-year lows. The price of US crude oil is now back at at $66.34/barrel, and Brent crude at around $70. Still sharply lower than a week ago, but broadly unchanged today. The bounce-back came after the cabinet of Saudi Arabia (the most powerful member of Opec) said the oil cartel had shown \u201ccohesion, unity and foresight\u201d by leaving production levels unchanged at their meeting last week. The Saudi cabinet also called for co-operation against \u201cmarket speculators\u201d, suggesting it thinks the selloff hasn\u2019t been driven purely by fundamentals. Larry Elliott, our economics editor, reckons the Russian central bank had to wade into the markets to prop up the ruble this lunchtime: A ruble in freefall does pose a threat to financial stability in two big ways. Firstly, it increases the foreign currency value of Russia\u2019s foreign liabilities, currently worth around $200bn (\u00a3127bn). Secondly, a continued fall in the exchange rate will encourage Russian citizens to convert rubles into dollars and euros, thus increasing the risk of bank runs. Russia\u2019s banks are in better shape than they were in 1998 and the government has the financial firepower to help them out should they get into trouble. But a plunging oil price and a plunging ruble still make the banks vulnerable. Hence the need to intervene. Here\u2019s Larry\u2019s analysis on the ruble\u2019s slide: Why the collapse in the Russian ruble matters to the global economy And here\u2019s the chart of the ruble vs the US dollar, showing how it spiked to record lows of 54 rubles/$1 (the high point on the graph) before dropping back: There\u2019s a strong correlation between the slump in the oil price in recent months and the weakness of the ruble. But the ruble has actually fallen more than you\u2019d expect, if you compare the current situation to the height of the financial crisis: Ashraf Laidi, Chief Global Strategist at cityindex.co.uk, explains (and provides a handy chart): Since making its most recent peak in June at $115.71 per barrel, Brent crude is down 39%, during which the ruble fell 37%. Interestingly, the ruble\u2019s decline matches that of the 2008-2009 when oil price crashed more than 75%. For the ruble to fall by the same magnitude on the back of an oil decline that\u2019s half that of 2008/9 highlights the sobering fact that there\u2019s more to ruble\u2019s woes than just falling oil. So what\u2019s changed? The Ukraine crisis is one obvious factor; sanctions imposed by the West could run for several years, and are already hitting trade and growth. Also, Russia\u2019s fiscal position has deteriorated over recent years. Back in 2006, it needed an oil price of around $21/barrel to break even -- not the $100/barrel today. Update: the ruble is clawing its way back from the brink, from 54 rubles to $1 to \u201cjust\u201d 52. Traders suspect the Central Bank of Russia has waded into the markets. Analysts at Citi say: \u201cIt looks like the Russian central bank could be the behind it.\u201d Time for a recap after a morning of generally downbeat economic news (with some highlights): The oil price has hit its lowest level since October 2009 this morning, amid fears that the global economy is slowing Opec\u2019s decision not to cut supplies continued to reverberate through the markets, too, sending Brent crude down over $3 per barrel to a five-year low of $67.53. It\u2019s recovered a little since, to $69.60, but remains weak: Energy Aspects\u2019 chief oil analyst Amrita Sen says the oil market \u201cis still very much in panic mode\u201d: \u201cOnce we get over the panic, Brent prices will probably stabilise at around $65-80 a barrel in the short term.\u201d Russia\u2019s ruble is in freefall today, down over 7% at record lows at around 53.7 rubles to the $1 (at pixel time). It\u2019s being dragged down by the oil price, and predictions of a sharp recession next year: Moscow-based investment bank Sberbank CIB said in a morning note: \u201cIn the short term, the Russian market is a victim of OPEC\u2019s apparent decision to reduce the volume of high-cost production through lower prices,\u201d \u201cThe market and the ruble will not stabilize until oil does.\u201d The falling oil price also hit European stock markets; the FTSE 100 is down 60 points, led by energy producers and miners. Wouter Sturkenboom, senior investment strategist at Russell Investments, explains (via Reuters) \u201cThere\u2019s downward pressure on many commodities. That is a function of disappointing global growth and especially the slowdown in China,\u201d That is negative for equities.\u201d The latest manufacturing surveys have shown that many factories struggled to grow last month. China\u2019s factory growth slowed to an eight month low, with firms reporting that growth in output and new orders both fell. The eurozone\u2019s manufacturing sector posted virtual stagnation, with activity falling in Germany, France and Italy. The UK did better, though - with manufacturing growth touching a four-month high. New exports orders are down again, though, showing weaker demand in emerging markets and Europe. Japan has been downgraded by Moody\u2019s, on fears about its ability to hits its fiscal and growth targets. In the City, shares in Vodafone have dropped on reports that it might tie up with America\u2019s Liberty Global: OIl exploration firm BG Group has bowed to criticism and cut the \u2018golden hello\u2019 being granted to its incoming CEO. Helge Lund will no longer be able to earn up to \u00a325m, but might scoop \u00a318m.... BG Group cuts Helge Lund\u2019s \u2018golden hello\u2019 after shareholder pressure The ruble\u2019s selloff continues... This chart provides a little perspective on this morning\u2019s rise in unsecured consumer borrowing: The slump in the oil price has piled more pain on Russia, sending the ruble into freefall today. The ruble has tumbled by 4.5% against the US dollar today, to 52.5 rubles to the $1. The fall in the oil price to below &amp;70/barrel is likely to drive Russia into recession next year. It needs an oil price around $100/barrel to break even. As this chart shows, the ruble has shed over 35% of its value this year. That makes it the second worst performing currency this year after the Ukranian hryvnia -- which has been routed since the military conflict in Eastern Ukraine triggered a deep and ongoing slump. Britons piled more debt onto their credit cards in October. Data from the Bank of England showed that net unsecured consumer credit rose to \u00a31.087 billion in October from \u00a3942 million in September. That may alarm the Bank; policymakers have warned that people have been dipping into their savings to fund spending, while they wait for real wages to rise. The robust UK factory data has given the pound a lift. Sterling has gained over half a cent against the US dollar, to $1.571. The euro is a little higher too, up 0.2% against the dollar, despite factory activity slowing to near-stagnation. Nicholas Ebisch, currency analyst for Caxton FX, suggests traders are relieved that the situation isn\u2019t even worse. Here\u2019s his take: \u201cSterling has rallied this morning after a positive Manufacturing PMI figure. With the pound steady so far on the day, this latest data has helped bolster the currency against the dollar and many other currencies to start the week off. However, the Euro has had an overall strong morning as well with Final Manufacturing PMI for the Eurozone showing only very slight growth at 50.1, but Spanish Manufacturing beating expectations at 54.7. A reading over 50.0 indicates that there is growth in the sector, and right now the Eurozone needs all the positive signs of growth that it can get.\u201d Today\u2019s forecast-beating UK manufacturing PMI survey shows that British factories are upbeat despite the troubles in Europe, says Rob Wood of Berenberg: UK manufacturing is resisting the weakness in the Eurozone on the back of strong domestic momentum this side of the Channel. New export orders fell again, especially from the EU, Russia and emerging markets, but domestic spending kept the show on the road. The slowdown in the UK housing sector continues, with the number of new mortgages approved by lenders hitting a 16-month low. A total of 59,426 new loans for house purchases were signed off in October, down from 61,234 in September. It indicates that tighter mortgage rules continue to take the heat out of the market. Markit economist Rob Dobson blames the weak euro, and the general economic slowdown, for the drop in new exports from UK factories last month: Slower global economic growth is hitting sales to emerging markets, while a strong sterling-euro exchange rate is also stifling trade with the eurozone nations. Britain\u2019s factory sector has outpaced the eurozone. Output, new orders and employment levels all grew last month, thanks to \u201csolid domestic\u201d demand, according to data just released by Markit. The UK manufacturing PMI (based on data from factory purchasing managers) rose to a four-month high of 53.5 in November, up from 53.3 in October. That indicates that growth was a little more rapid last month, despite concerns that the UK economy is slowing down. However, new export order growth \u201cremained weak\u201d during November, falling for the third month running. Markit says: Exporters faced a combination of subdued global market conditions and a relatively strong sterling-euro exchange rate. David Noble, CEO at the Chartered Institute of Procurement &amp; Supply, agrees that UK factories relied on domestic demand last month. Noble added: This domestic uplift has been the counterbalance to disappointing export opportunities with the strength of sterling and lack of activity from emerging markets having an impact. Europe\u2019s economy woes deepened last month, as growth in its manufacturing sector ground to a near-standstill. That\u2019s the message from this morning\u2019s purchasing managers surveys, which show that storm clouds continued to gather over the eurozone economy in November. Markit\u2019s eurozone factory PMI fell to just 50.1 last month - a fraction above stagnation. It is based on interviews with thousands of firms at eight eurozone countries; five nations reported contractions in November, the highest proportion since July 2013. Companies reported that new orders fell last month, while output grew at a slower rate again and manufacturing employment was broadly flat. The slowdown was driven by contractions in Europe\u2019s three largest economies -- Germany, France and Italy. That wiped out Spain\u2019s decent performance (see earlier post) Chris Williamson, Markit\u2019s chief economist, says \u201cthe situation in euro area manufacturing is worse than previously thought\u201d (Markit\u2019s \u2018flash\u2019 PMI report, two weeks ago, was less worrying). Not only is the performance of the sector the worst seen since mid-2013, there is a risk that renewed rot is spreading across the region from the core. The sector has more or less stagnated since August, but we are now seeing, for the first time in nearly one-and-a-half years, the three largest economies all suffering manufacturing downturns. \u201cGermany\u2019s export engine has stalled, causing the steepest deterioration of new orders in the country since December 2012, and new business is also falling in both France and Italy, boding ill for production in coming months. Spain, Ireland and the Netherlands all outperformed the rest of Europe, Williamson added, but can they avoid being dragged back? Ouch! Germany\u2019s factory sector suffered a small contraction last month, showing that Europe\u2019s largest economy struggled in November. The German factory PMI fell to just 49.5, as firms reported the sharpest drop in new orders in almost two years. This is the first time in 17 months that the German manufacturing PMI has come in below 50 points, showing a fall in activity. France\u2019s manufacturing base also contracted last month. The French factory PMI hit 48.4, largely unchanged from October\u2019s 48.5 (but not as bad as the flash estimate released two weeks ago) Italy\u2019s factory sector continued to shrink last month, according to data firm Markit. The Italian manufacturing PMI came in at 49.0 for November, weaker than expected (anything below 50 indicates a contraction). Just in: Moody\u2019s has downgraded Japan\u2019s credit rating, from AA3 (the fourth-highest rating) to A1 (five-highest). Moody\u2019s blamed \u2018heightened uncertainty\u2019 over Japan\u2019s ability to hit its deficit reduction goals, and to achieve the growth targets set by the government. It says: The first driver for the downgrade of the Japan government\u2019s debt rating to A1 is the rising uncertainty over whether the government\u2019s medium-term deficit reduction goal is achievable, and whether policy makers can overcome the tensions inherent in promoting growth while simultaneously stabilizing and reversing the rising debt trajectory..... The second driver for the downgrade is the rising uncertainty over the government\u2019s ability to enhance medium term growth through structural economic reform -- the third \u2018arrow\u2019 of Abenomics -- success in which will be crucial to achieve fiscal consolidation. While some indicators suggest a pick-up in economic activity over the past year, potential economic growth remains low..... The full statement is here. The yen wobbled on the news, hitting a new seven year low of \u00a5119.15 against the US dollar. But the downgrade isn\u2019t likely to have any immediate impact on Japan. Its borrowing costs are currently at record lows, despite its huge national debt (over 200% of GDP). Australia\u2019s stock market has also been hit hard by the oil price slide. Fears that the global is slowing down helped to wipe $30bn off the main Australian index today. That takes the total losses since Friday to $53bn, on an index heavy with mining and energy firms. The benchmark S&amp;P/ASX 200 Index shed almost 2% today. with the energy sector diving by over 6%. The Sydney Morning Herald has more details: Local shares are now trading down 2.7 per cent for the year-to-date, while the dollar is trading around levels not seen since July 2010 as a slide in global oil prices puts pressure on the local market. At its bi-annual meeting last week, the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) elected to maintain production levels despite a slide in energy prices over recent months as the growth in global supply has outstripped the growth in demand. \u201cThrough OPEC the Saudis have declared an oil price war on the US and Australia is getting caught in the crossfire,\u201d Fiducian Group investment manager Conrad Burge said. Shares in oil companies are being hit hard in London this morning, as Brent crude hits a five-year low below $68 per barrel this morning. The FTSE 100 has fallen by 60 points, or almost 1%, at the start of trading. Energy and commodity firms are leading the fallers; exploration firms Tullow Oil and Weir Group are the worst hit. Good news from Spain, its manufacturing sector expanded at the fastest rate since June 2007. The Spanish factory PMI rose to 54.7 last month, beating expectations of 52.1. Markit, which conducted the survey, says: Output and new orders each rose at rates not seen since prior to the economic crisis, while employment also increased at a faster pace Firms also reported a widespread drop in raw material costs, with cotton, dairy products and petrol reportedly down in price. That won\u2019t ease fears that the euro area could slide into deflation. The sharp fall in the oil price is excellent news for consumers and firms with large transport costs. Analyst Steve Baines flags up that drivers have already felt some benefit: Analyst Ian Williams of Peel Hunt says the prospect of cheaper oil is dominating the markets today. The immediate focus will remain on cheaper oil; good news for consumers and for those companies benefiting from reduced input cost pressures, less so for central bankers wrestling with disinflationary concerns. The oil price has hit its lowest levels since October 2009 as the steep selloff than began last week continues. The news that China\u2019s manufacturing growth had hit an eight-month low helped to drive the price of a barrel of Brent crude down to just $67.76 this morning. That\u2019s a fall of 3.4%, or $2.40, since Friday night. Brent has tumbled by 14% since Opec decided not to cut this production levels last week: New York crude also slid to a new five-year low this morning, hitting $63.95 per barrel. The scale of the selloff has stunned many in the markets: As Phillip Futures analysts said in a research note: \u201cJust when the market was thinking that a 4-year low for crude oil was bad enough, we have hit a 5-year low after the OPEC meeting,\u201d Another worrying sign - Indonesia\u2019s factory PMI fell to its lowest level since the survey began 44 months ago. Asian factories suffered a drop in growth last month, in the latest sign that the global economy faltered in November. China\u2019s factories grew at their slowest pace in eight months, according to Beijing\u2019s survey of the sector. Firms reported a weakening in output, and in new orders. The official Chinese Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) fell to 50.3 last month from 50.8 recorded in October, showing slowing growth in the country\u2019s factories and workshops. It helps explains why the Chinese central bank cut interest rates unexpectedly last month. HSBC\u2019s rival measure, which is more focused on small firms, fell to exactly 50.0 - the cut off point between expansion and contraction. HSBC found that manufacturing production levels fell last month, for the first time in six months. New exports grew at the slowest rate since June, as demand from overseas waned... and input prices fell, as deflationary pressures grew. HSBC\u2019s chief economist for China, Hongbin Qu, says the data shows China\u2019s economy weakening. Domestic demand expanded at a sluggish pace while new export order growth eased to a five-month low. Disinflationary pressures remain strong while the labour market weakened further. European stock markets are expected to fall this morning, as growth fears and the falling oil price hit stocks: Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Today, we\u2019ll be covering the latest health check of global manufacturing, which will probably show that Europe\u2019s factories struggled last month. Markit\u2019s surveys of factory output are expected to show another contraction in France and Italy, and weaker growth in other parts of the eurozone. The UK manufacturing PMI is also released, at 9.30am, giving a picture of the British economy ahead of Wednesday\u2019s Autumn Statement. Fears over global growth are already weighing on the markets, pushing the oil price down again this morning (more in a moment). Gold is under pressure too, after Switzerland voted not to force its central bank to told 20% of its assets in gold. The retail sector may be worried, after data last night showed that Americans spent 11% less over the Black Friday period than a year ago. Oh, and speaking of seasonal (or do I mean spurious?) slogans, its Cyber Monday. Cyber Monday to kick off December retail spree",

The Russian central bank was reported to be active in the currency markets on Monday as it sought to arrest what was looking like the biggest one-day fall in the rouble since the debt default of 1998. It\u2019s easy to see why Moscow backtracked. The rouble was down by more than 6% against the dollar in early trading and is vying with the Ukrainian hryvnia as the world\u2019s worst-performing currency of 2014. The word \u201cfreefall\u201d is much overused in financial markets. Not this time. More than two-thirds of Russia\u2019s exports are from the energy sector, and the cost of crude has dropped by 40% since the summer. The sell-off has accelerated since Opec decided against production curbs at last week\u2019s meeting. Downward pressure on the rouble intensified amid market speculation that there would be no intervention. There were reasons for adopting a hands-off approach. Chucking a chunk of Russia\u2019s sizeable reserves at a rapidly falling rouble could be an expensive and ultimately pointless exercise. Intervention is normally more effective when it is going with the grain of market sentiment, and the rouble is currently toxic. What\u2019s more, a weaker currency should help to support growth and take some of the pressure off the budget by boosting the rouble value of Russia\u2019s oil reserves. So why did Moscow blink, given that the central bank\u2019s official line has been that it would only step in to defend the rouble if there was a threat to financial stability? That, though, is precisely the point. A rouble in freefall does pose a threat to financial stability in two big ways. First, it increases the foreign currency value of Russia\u2019s foreign liabilities, worth about $200bn (\u00a3127bn). Second, a continued fall in the exchange rate will encourage Russian citizens to convert roubles into dollars and euros, thus increasing the risk of bank runs. Russia\u2019s banks are in better shape than they were in 1998 and the government has the financial firepower to help them out should they get into trouble. But a plunging oil price and a plunging rouble still make the banks vulnerable. Hence the need to intervene.",

Balfours\u2019 own conservative directors value was \u00a31,051m at the interims, although there will have been some changes since then including the closure of the Greater Gabbard OFTO |(\u00a315m of equity), the unwinding of the discount and disposals (we assume gains of \u00a333m in the second half or proceeds of \u00a366m assuming two time book). In our mind, even if all of the assets were sold for this low number, the PPP business would still have a material value, note the \u00a3170m of equity expected to be invested over the next two years and the likelihood of investments beyond that.</p> <p>While the Laing offer looks low, it does highlight the significant value of the business. Balfour Beatty\u2019s market cap is \u00a31.3bn; there is at least \u00a31.0bn of PPP assets, we estimate \u00a30.3bn of residual PPP value, we estimate \u00a3490m of value on Support Services and \u00a370m of pro forma average cash (\u00a3220m of year end cash). This indicates a negative value of \u00a30.6bn for the rest of the business, which is too low, given that most of Construction is performing satisfactorily and the losses can be discontinued (albeit with significant write-offs in January).</p> </blockquote> <p>Oriel issued a downbeat note of JLIF on the news:<br></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Whilst at this stage there is a lack of information on the proposal, we do think it is likely that in addition to JLIF there are likely to be a number of parties interested in these PFI assets. A large queue of potential buyers could well form, with the danger being that the \u2018winning bidder\u2019 is likely to end-up paying a relatively high price for the assets. A \u00a31bn equity issue would double JLIF\u2019s size from its current market cap of \u00a31bn and some investors are likely to welcome the increased stockmarket liquidity associated with an enlarged JLIF. The market currently seems to have an insatiable appetite for listed infrastructure, with this demonstrated by the mid-teen premia that many of the funds are currently trading on. However, we do think there is likely to be some short-term indigestion if the market has to absorb \u00a31bn of equity from JLIF. We re-iterate our reduce recommendation with a fair value of 113p and we think it likely that the whole listed infrastructure fund sector may see some price weakness in the short-term given the size of this potential equity issuance.</p> </blockquote> <p>Meanwhile Canaccord Genuity said:<br></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It initially looked unclear as to whether or not this included the US portfolio or just the UK - as this makes a huge difference. The sensitivities are that if it is just UK, we value the UK current assets at \u00a3877m plus a value for the UK pipeline of \u00a355m, which makes \u00a3932m; so if it is just UK it is a fair price and could be looked at. If it includes the US, which having spoken to Laing\u2019s PR company Finsbury it appears to do, it is a poor price and should be dismissed in our view, as we value the combined UK/US business at \u00a31.3bn in our sum of the parts.</p> </blockquote> <p>Overall the<strong> FTSE 100</strong> has fallen 58.55 points to 6662.07, hit by the continuing decline in the oil price with Brent crude down another 1.77% to $68.91 a barrel.</p> <p>Gold has dropped nearly $2 to \u00a311.65 an ounce after Switzerland voted in a referendum not to increase its reserves of the precious metal.</p> <p>And disappointing Chinese manufacturing data for November revived worries about the state of the country\u2019s economy, hitting the mining sector.</p> <p>So among the fallers are <strong>Tullow Oil</strong>, down 28.3p at 397.7p and not helped by Citigroup cutting its target price from 935p to 567p with a neutral rating.</p> <p>Among the mining companies, <strong>BHP Billiton</strong> is down 53.5p at 1463.5p and <strong>Anglo American</strong> is 35.5p lower at \u00a312.86. <strong>Randgold Resources </strong>has fallen 115p to \u00a341.38.</p> <p>But British Airways owner <strong>International Airlines Group</strong> is up 9.3p at 466.8p on the prospect of lower fuel costs.</p> <p><strong>Aberdeen Asset Managment</strong> has added after slightly better than expected full year profits of \u00a3490m, up 2%, and said it had seen signs of revival in emerging markets.

Balfours\u2019 own conservative directors value was \u00a31,051m at the interims, although there will have been some changes since then including the closure of the Greater Gabbard OFTO |(\u00a315m of equity), the unwinding of the discount and disposals (we assume gains of \u00a333m in the second half or proceeds of \u00a366m assuming two time book). In our mind, even if all of the assets were sold for this low number, the PPP business would still have a material value, note the \u00a3170m of equity expected to be invested over the next two years and the likelihood of investments beyond that. While the Laing offer looks low, it does highlight the significant value of the business. Balfour Beatty\u2019s market cap is \u00a31.3bn; there is at least \u00a31.0bn of PPP assets, we estimate \u00a30.3bn of residual PPP value, we estimate \u00a3490m of value on Support Services and \u00a370m of pro forma average cash (\u00a3220m of year end cash). This indicates a negative value of \u00a30.6bn for the rest of the business, which is too low, given that most of Construction is performing satisfactorily and the losses can be discontinued (albeit with significant write-offs in January). Oriel issued a downbeat note of JLIF on the news: Whilst at this stage there is a lack of information on the proposal, we do think it is likely that in addition to JLIF there are likely to be a number of parties interested in these PFI assets. A large queue of potential buyers could well form, with the danger being that the \u2018winning bidder\u2019 is likely to end-up paying a relatively high price for the assets. A \u00a31bn equity issue would double JLIF\u2019s size from its current market cap of \u00a31bn and some investors are likely to welcome the increased stockmarket liquidity associated with an enlarged JLIF. The market currently seems to have an insatiable appetite for listed infrastructure, with this demonstrated by the mid-teen premia that many of the funds are currently trading on. However, we do think there is likely to be some short-term indigestion if the market has to absorb \u00a31bn of equity from JLIF. We re-iterate our reduce recommendation with a fair value of 113p and we think it likely that the whole listed infrastructure fund sector may see some price weakness in the short-term given the size of this potential equity issuance. Meanwhile Canaccord Genuity said: It initially looked unclear as to whether or not this included the US portfolio or just the UK - as this makes a huge difference. The sensitivities are that if it is just UK, we value the UK current assets at \u00a3877m plus a value for the UK pipeline of \u00a355m, which makes \u00a3932m; so if it is just UK it is a fair price and could be looked at. If it includes the US, which having spoken to Laing\u2019s PR company Finsbury it appears to do, it is a poor price and should be dismissed in our view, as we value the combined UK/US business at \u00a31.3bn in our sum of the parts. Overall the FTSE 100 has fallen 58.55 points to 6662.07, hit by the continuing decline in the oil price with Brent crude down another 1.77% to $68.91 a barrel. Gold has dropped nearly $2 to \u00a311.65 an ounce after Switzerland voted in a referendum not to increase its reserves of the precious metal. And disappointing Chinese manufacturing data for November revived worries about the state of the country\u2019s economy, hitting the mining sector. So among the fallers are Tullow Oil, down 28.3p at 397.7p and not helped by Citigroup cutting its target price from 935p to 567p with a neutral rating. Among the mining companies, BHP Billiton is down 53.5p at 1463.5p and Anglo American is 35.5p lower at \u00a312.86. Randgold Resources has fallen 115p to \u00a341.38. But British Airways owner International Airlines Group is up 9.3p at 466.8p on the prospect of lower fuel costs. Aberdeen Asset Managment has added after slightly better than expected full year profits of \u00a3490m, up 2%, and said it had seen signs of revival in emerging markets. Weakness there had contributed to \u00a320bn of net outflows, but the company said it had recently seen some of the concerns abate and outflows from Asian and emerging market funds had abated. Peel Hunt issued a buy note, saying: While today\u2019s results were largely as expected, operating cash generation remains strong, underpinning expectations of good dividend growth in the coming years.",

The Rev Graham Hunter of St John\u2019s Church, Hoxton, which is an active member institution of Citizens UK, is to dress as a lead character from Charles Dickens\u2019 A Christmas Carol and quiz Primark\u2019s parent company on whether it is willing to offer staff fair pay at Friday\u2019s annual shareholder meeting as part of a campaign to persuade more retailers to pay the living wage. The \u201cstop scrooging\u201d campaign, also backed by ShareAction, has calculated that employees should be paid at least \u00a39.15 an hour in London and \u00a37.85 outside London in order to afford life\u2019s essentials such as food and housing. Hunter said: \u201cChristmas is about care, compassion and giving. I hope that by asking Primark to pay their staff a living wage the retailer will realise the benefits they can gain both reputationally, but also the increased loyalty, motivation and productivity their staff will give back to them once they feel they are valued by their employer. \u201cPaying the living wage is the right moral decision to make and a savvy business choice.\u201d Sainsbury\u2019s, Argos, M&amp;S, Debenhams, Sports Direct, Next, Carphone Warehouse, John Lewis, Tesco, Morrisons, and B&amp;Q will also be targeted. Activists will attend Debenhams\u2019 annual shareholder meeting next week while a \u201cpunk magician\u201d named \u201cG\u201d will lead activists in replacing pricing labels on shelves with spoof labels which call on stores and shoppers to support the living wage for shop staff. Campaigners will also tweet retailers asking them to pay staff the living wage using the hashtag #stopscrooging. Eighteen of Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 companies are now accredited living wage employers, including big names such as Barclays, Pearson, and Legal &amp; General. However, none of the UK\u2019s large listed retailers pay the living wage, with shop assistants and bar staff among the most likely to live \u201chand to mouth\u201d, according to independent research by Cambridge Policy Consultants. Rhys Moore, director of the Living Wage Foundation, says: \u201cLow pay costs the taxpayer money \u2013 firms that pay the minimum wage are seeing their workers\u2019 pay topped up through the benefits system.\u201d Research, conducted by Markit for KPMG, shows 43% of part-time workers earn less than the living wage, compared with 13% of full-time employees. \u2022 This article was amended on 2 December 2014.

The \u201cstop scrooging\u201d campaign, also backed by ShareAction, has calculated that employees should be paid at least \u00a39.15 an hour in London and \u00a37.85 outside London in order to afford life\u2019s essentials such as food and housing.</p> <p>Hunter said: \u201cChristmas is about care, compassion and giving. I hope that by asking Primark to pay their staff a living wage the retailer will realise the benefits they can gain both reputationally, but also the increased loyalty, motivation and productivity their staff will give back to them once they feel they are valued by their employer.</p> <p>\u201cPaying the living wage is the right moral decision to make and a savvy business choice.\u201d</p> <p>Sainsbury\u2019s, Argos, M&amp;S, Debenhams, Sports Direct, Next, Carphone Warehouse, John Lewis, Tesco, Morrisons, and B&amp;Q will also be targeted.
