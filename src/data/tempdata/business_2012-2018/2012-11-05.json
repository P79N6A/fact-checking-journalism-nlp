It was rank dishonesty. There were separate acts of individual moments of betrayal.\"</p> <p>Levene \u2013 known as \"Beano\" because of his love of the comic book \u2013 once had an estimated wealth of \u00a315m to \u00a320m and was a former vice-chairman of Leyton Orient Football Club. Barry Hearn, the club's chairman, once described him as a \"nice family man [with] three lovely kids\".</p> <p>But Levene was also a compulsive gambler who loved a spread bet before his empire collapsed in bankruptcy. Levene told investors he had bought shares on their behalf but instead spent the money on buying property in the UK and Israel, expensive guns, flash cars, private schools for his children and flying friends to parties in St Tropez. He once spent nearly \u00a3600,000 on a family celebration and his parties attracted luminaries such as Simon Cowell and Sir Philip Green, the retail tycoon who owns Topshop.</p> <p>Once one of the best-connected figures in the City, Levene also counted Jeremy Isaacs, Lehman Brothers' former London boss, as his friend.</p> <p>To keep up the illusion Levene provided investors with false \"profits\", conning them into believing he was a successful trader. The profits were in fact funds from new investors \u2013 a classic Ponzi scheme, such as the one run by the American fraudster Bernard Madoff, where money is taken from one client to give to another.</p> <p>The son of an electrician, Levene quit school at 15 without qualifications and joined the London Stock Exchange as a trader in the runup to the big bang deregulation of the City in 1984. He described himself as having 25 years' experience in the equity and derivative markets, having worked at the stockbroker Phillips &amp; Drew, the moneybroker Tullett &amp; Tokyo and Trio Equity Derivatives, where he was managing director. He also worked as an executive director at the hedge fund Integrated Asset Mangement.</p> <p>His sales pitch was that he could get access to share offerings in companies that were unattainable for ordinary investors. Between 1 January 2005 and 31 October 2009 he pocketed more than \u00a3250m from investors, according to the Serious Fraud Office (SFO).</p> <p>The fraud came to an end in 2009 when several investors sued him in the civil courts to recover their money. Gloag and Souter, for example, handed Levene \u00a35m each to invest in fundraisings by the mining firm Xstrata and HSBC bank.</p> <p>When they made \u00a33.8m each they instructed him to sell, but said they never received the capital back or the profit they were due. Their litigation marked the beginning of the end for Levene. The Essex businessmen Victor Lupson and John Bennett made a claim for \u00a338m. Levene was also chased by spread betting firms.</p> <p>Levene also admitted one charge of false accounting and one of obtaining a money transfer by deception.</p> <p>He was declared bankrupt in the high court on 7 October 2009 and the SFO started a criminal investigation the same month. The SFO said he used the money to fund his lavish lifestyle. More than \u00a318m was spent on property, luxury holidays and other lifestyle expenses.</p> <p>Jonathan Midgley, lawyer for the SFO, said: \"This was a complex and extensive fraud where Nicholas Levene used investors' monies to finance a lavish personal lifestyle.\"</p> <p>Confiscation proceedings have been fixed for 25 March at Southwark crown court. Separately, a Deloitte partner, Louise Brittain, who was appointed trustee in Levene's bankruptcy in 2009, has still not finished collecting all his assets.</p> <p>She said they could be worth tens or hundreds of millions of pounds. His villa in Israel and chauffeur-driven Bentley have already been sold and the bulk of the remaining assets are property and bank accounts, both in the UK and abroad.</p> <p>It is one of the toughest sentences ever issued for financial fraud. Abbas Gokal was jailed for 14 years for his role in the Bank of Credit &amp; Commerce International fraud in 1997 and later got a further three years' imprisonment for failing to comply with his confiscation order.</p>",

But Levene was also a compulsive gambler who loved a spread bet before his empire collapsed in bankruptcy. Levene told investors he had bought shares on their behalf but instead spent the money on buying property in the UK and Israel, expensive guns, flash cars, private schools for his children and flying friends to parties in St Tropez. He once spent nearly \u00a3600,000 on a family celebration and his parties attracted luminaries such as Simon Cowell and Sir Philip Green, the retail tycoon who owns Topshop. Once one of the best-connected figures in the City, Levene also counted Jeremy Isaacs, Lehman Brothers' former London boss, as his friend. To keep up the illusion Levene provided investors with false \"profits\", conning them into believing he was a successful trader. The profits were in fact funds from new investors \u2013 a classic Ponzi scheme, such as the one run by the American fraudster Bernard Madoff, where money is taken from one client to give to another. The son of an electrician, Levene quit school at 15 without qualifications and joined the London Stock Exchange as a trader in the runup to the big bang deregulation of the City in 1984. He described himself as having 25 years' experience in the equity and derivative markets, having worked at the stockbroker Phillips &amp; Drew, the moneybroker Tullett &amp; Tokyo and Trio Equity Derivatives, where he was managing director. He also worked as an executive director at the hedge fund Integrated Asset Mangement. His sales pitch was that he could get access to share offerings in companies that were unattainable for ordinary investors. Between 1 January 2005 and 31 October 2009 he pocketed more than \u00a3250m from investors, according to the Serious Fraud Office (SFO). The fraud came to an end in 2009 when several investors sued him in the civil courts to recover their money. Gloag and Souter, for example, handed Levene \u00a35m each to invest in fundraisings by the mining firm Xstrata and HSBC bank. When they made \u00a33.8m each they instructed him to sell, but said they never received the capital back or the profit they were due. Their litigation marked the beginning of the end for Levene. The Essex businessmen Victor Lupson and John Bennett made a claim for \u00a338m. Levene was also chased by spread betting firms. Levene also admitted one charge of false accounting and one of obtaining a money transfer by deception. He was declared bankrupt in the high court on 7 October 2009 and the SFO started a criminal investigation the same month. The SFO said he used the money to fund his lavish lifestyle. More than \u00a318m was spent on property, luxury holidays and other lifestyle expenses. Jonathan Midgley, lawyer for the SFO, said: \"This was a complex and extensive fraud where Nicholas Levene used investors' monies to finance a lavish personal lifestyle.\" Confiscation proceedings have been fixed for 25 March at Southwark crown court. Separately, a Deloitte partner, Louise Brittain, who was appointed trustee in Levene's bankruptcy in 2009, has still not finished collecting all his assets. She said they could be worth tens or hundreds of millions of pounds. His villa in Israel and chauffeur-driven Bentley have already been sold and the bulk of the remaining assets are property and bank accounts, both in the UK and abroad. It is one of the toughest sentences ever issued for financial fraud. Abbas Gokal was jailed for 14 years for his role in the Bank of Credit &amp; Commerce International fraud in 1997 and later got a further three years' imprisonment for failing to comply with his confiscation order.",

      "bodyText": "An escalating row between solar panel makers stepped up a gear on Monday when China complained to the World Trade Organisation that Italy and Greece had unfairly favoured domestic suppliers. China, the world's largest solar panel maker, accused the European Union of breaching world trade rules only days after saying it would consider blocking imports of solar technology from Europe. It said the crux of its complaint centred on offers by Rome and Athens of higher electricity prices to solar power producers that use mainly locally sourced components. Concerns that the financial crisis would bring simmering protectionist disputes to the surface proved misplaced until this year. During 2012 the WTO received 25 complaints compared to eight in 2011. Analysts blame the downturn in global growth this year for sparking a series of disputes that range from the US and Mexico complaining about Argentinian import restrictions on meat and fruit to objections from Brazil over South African anti-dumping duties on Brazilian frozen meat. The biggest disputes involve the four major trading blocs \u2013 the US, China, Japan and the EU. Solar panels have become a flashpoint after Chinese panel makers maintained production despite a sharp slowdown in demand. Washington has come under intense pressure to raise tariffs on Chinese goods after firms objected to panels being dumped in the US market. Congress recently sanctioned sweeping restrictions on goods it says are dumped by China under rules allowing \"the application of countervailing measures to non-market economy countries\". China has responded with a series of complaints to the WTO, one of which appears to be the same complaint that the EU and Japan have brought against Canada for protecting its solar panel industry. \"The Chinese government has the right and the responsibility to fight for a fair international trade environment for China's solar industry,\" Chinese Ministry of Commerce spokesman Shen Danyang said in a statement. Shen said all countries should strengthen industry cooperation and reject short-term \"protectionist\" measures. By lodging its complaint, China triggers the formal process for a WTO dispute and, if talks with the EU fail to resolve the issue, after 60 days it could ask the global trade body to adjudicate. While Germany has built a strong domestic solar industry, much of it in the former communist region around Leipzig, Italy and Greece have struggled against local corruption and a reluctance among investors to build solar farms to replicate the same manufacturing base. However, the EU is the world's largest market for solar products and is a particular target for Chinese manufacturers. Tensions rose earlier this year after Chinese firms dropped their prices 30% after a long period of over-supply. EU countries accused the Chinese authorities of dumping artificially low cost panels that undermined domestic businesses. About 60% of China's exports of solar panels and components went to the EU in 2011, generating \u20ac21bn (\u00a317bn) and accounting for 7% of all Chinese exports to the region, according to Bloomberg. A group of 25 European companies, led by Germany's SolarWorld, filed a complaint with the European Commission in September, claiming Chinese rivals were unfairly benefiting from illegal subsidies. \u2022 This article was amended on 6 November 2012.

      "bodyText": "It's easy to see why many Greek MPs are reluctant to vote for the latest austerity measures demanded by the European Union, International Monetary Fund and the European Central Bank. The economy is still shrinking after a five-year slump, so the idea of further slashing demand hardly appeals. Yet without the austerity Greece will not get the next tranche of its bailout, leaving the government unable to pay its bills. The words rock and hard place spring to mind. Despite mounting public unrest, Greece is trying to make itself more competitive by cutting pay, pensions and welfare benefits. This process, internal devaluation, is the only logical policy for countries that reject the traditional remedies: making the currency cheaper or defaulting on its debts. This was Argentina's approach just over a decade ago, when it found pegging the peso to the US dollar a crippling burden. South America's second-biggest economy enjoyed several years of strong growth after it ended dollar convertibility and defaulted on its debts. Most of the country's creditors agreed to take a substantial haircut but a hardcore group held out for claims to be paid in full. Last week, their case was upheld in a New York court. Even if Argentina has to pay the vulture funds in full \u2013 and it is currently expressing defiance \u2013 Buenos Aires might still argue that devaluation and default in 2002 was better than the alternative. Greece may eventually come to the same conclusion but Argentina's experience shows that for Athens it is a question of choosing the least bad option. There are no unambiguously good ones.",

      "body": "<p>It's easy to see why many Greek MPs are reluctant to vote for the latest austerity measures demanded by the European Union, International Monetary Fund and the European Central Bank. The economy is still shrinking after a five-year slump, so the idea of further slashing demand hardly appeals. Yet without the austerity Greece will not get the next tranche of its bailout, leaving the government unable to pay its bills. The words rock and hard place spring to mind.</p> <p>Despite mounting public unrest, Greece is trying to make itself more competitive by cutting pay, pensions and welfare benefits. This process, internal devaluation, is the only logical policy for countries that reject the traditional remedies: making the currency cheaper or defaulting on its debts.</p> <p>This was Argentina's approach just over a decade ago, when it found pegging the peso to the US dollar a crippling burden. South America's second-biggest economy enjoyed several years of strong growth after it ended dollar convertibility and defaulted on its debts. Most of the country's creditors agreed to take a substantial haircut but a hardcore group held out for claims to be paid in full. Last week, their case was upheld in a New York court.</p> <p>Even if Argentina has to pay the vulture funds in full \u2013 and it is currently expressing defiance \u2013 Buenos Aires might still argue that devaluation and default in 2002 was better than the alternative. Greece may eventually come to the same conclusion but Argentina's experience shows that for Athens it is a question of choosing the least bad option. There are no unambiguously good ones.</p>",

Chief executive Stuart Gulliver has warned that the eventual fines could be \"higher, perhaps significantly higher.\" A serious hit is coming. There are good reasons for Gulliver to be fearful. First, he can't be confident that HSBC's pleas of contrition will yield any benefit. As he says, the various US authorities have \"substantial discretion in deciding exactly how to resolve this matter\". What's more, the bank could face corporate criminal charges. Second, Standard Chartered forked out $340m for offences, relating to the reporting of Iran-related transactions, that look puny compared to what went on at HSBC. The Standard settlement was widely regarded as a shake-down led by a new-ish New York regulator trying to make a name for itself. But if $340m is the going rate for minor infringements in the US, what's the score for an HSBC-style real deal? Five times as much, which is roughly where the provisions stand now? Ten times? More? When a final tally is established we may reflect on what a soft ride the officer class at HSBC has received for this disgraceful chapter in the bank's history. Remember the seriousness of the allegation: a Senate committee said HSBC \"exposed the US financial system to a wide array of money laundering, drug trafficking, and terrorist financing risks due to poor anti-money laundering controls\". And remember that the period in question is more than half a decade \u2013 from 2004 to 2010. Some individuals have left the bank as a result, says Gulliver, but he won't say how many. Some bonuses have been clawed back but, again, he won't provide details. Such shyness hardly meets the test of accountability that shareholders, who ultimately pay these fines, would expect. For example, has Lord Green \u2013 chief executive from 2003 to 2006, then executive chairman to 2010 and now a government trade minister \u2013 been caught by the claw-back principle? Or is this a case of a bank admitting that mistakes were made but simultaneously maintaining that nobody in the boardroom could have been expected to do anything differently? Gulliver's efforts to improve HSBC's culture appear sincere and forceful. But they would be improved by a fuller account of how the Mexican operation, in particular, fell so short of acceptable standards. Negotiations with US authorities currently make that demand difficult to meet. But when a settlement is finally reached, the bank should tell all.

      "bodyText": "Time for a closing summary of events in the eurozone crisis. \u2022 Greece's \u20ac13.5bn austerity package has finally reached parliament. The programme has been signed by all government ministers, which means it can be considered by parliamentary committees on Tuesday and then put to a full vote on Wednesday (see 5.07pm) Democratic Left, the junior partner in the coalition, tells us it will abstain on the vote and predicts a narrow win for Antonis Samaras's government (see 4.35pm) \u2022 The vote has been overshadowed by a report that eurozone leaders may not take a decision on Greece's next aid injection at their next meeting. One official told Reuters that there was no guarantee of a decision on 12 November (see 4.07pm) \u2022 Strikes have already been underway in Greece, ahead of a two-day general strike which begins on Tuesday. Transport links were disrupted in Athens (see 11.41am), while taxi drivers demonstrated in Thessaloniki (see 3.35pm) and journalists held their own rally (see 1.05pm). Power workers are due to start their own industrial action this evening. \u2022 Jitters over the US election and the Greek vote have hit the City. The euro fell to $1.277 against the US dollar, while the major European indices all closed in the red. In another worrying sign, German 2-year bond yields turned negative (see 8.07am) \u2022 UK service sector raised fears that Britain's economic recovery was stumbling. Growth hit its lowest level since December 2010, worse than expected (see 9.43am). Separate data for the US was also weaker than predicted (see 3.20pm) \u2022 The French government has been presented with a report arguing for a wide-ranging shake-up to help businesses compete. Businessman Louis Gallois said the country needs a competitive shock (see 2.07pm). \u2022 The Netherlands has a new coalition government after government ministers were sworn in. Twice! (see 1.37pm) We'll be back tomorrow - to cover the political discussions in the Athens parliament, day one of the Greek general strike, and other events in the crisis. Until then, thanks, and goodnight! Over in Spain, the government has just announced that it will extend its regional liquidity fund (used to finance its struggling regions) until 2013. Reuters has the quote. No further details were immediately available... ...however latest bailout requests had meant that almost all the \u20ac17bn on offer had been taken up. The Greek austerity package has finally reached the Athens parliament. Greek finance minister Yannis Stournaras presented the programme in the last few minutes, having obtained signatures from all government ministers (following Antonis Roupakiotis's will-he won't he? tango). So, the game is afoot! Nothing else is expected to happen today, though. Instead, the programme (known technically as the 3rd memorandum), will be discussed by parliamentary committees on Tuesday. On Wednesday, the whole chamber should discuss the plan \u2013 culminating in a nail-biting vote late on Wednesday night. And more in from Greece where our correspondent Helena Smith can confirm that the ruling coalition's smallest partner, the Democratic Left party (Dimar), will not be voting for the austerity bill, but nor will they rebel and attempt to vote it down Instead, they will sit on the sidelines when it comes to a vote on Wednesday. Helena writes: Amid all the ambivalence ahead of the vote, of one thing we can be sure: the Democratic Left is not going to renege on its promise to stick to its guns, says Dimitris Hadzisokratis who is in charge of the party's economic policy. \"We will give our full support to the fiscal adjustment programme and back the [2013] budget when it is put to parliament for vote on Sunday but we will abstain from voting in favour of the austerity programme because we disagree fully with the labour reforms that are also included in the package,\" he told me. \"Other than that, there is no reason not to support the government,\" he said rejecting rumours that the Democratic Left was considering pulling out of the coalition. \"My own personal feeling is that social reaction will not correspond to the weight of the measures and will be much less than anticipated because people can see there is no alternative.\" However, the veteran leftist acknowledged that the double vote was likely to be close and described his optimism as \"restrained.\" \"I think the measures will pass but no one can be certain,\" he said. Meanwhile, says Helena, while the new austerity programme is to be presented to parliament today no one quite knows when it will happen. \"The Greek finance minister Yiannis Stournaras is expected to present the bill on behalf of several ministries, today, but when exactly is anyone's guess,\" said one well-informed insider. \"Not even the parliament seems to know although officials there are saying it will have to happen before 11:30 this evening because after that the parliament will close.\" Speaking of the G20 finance minister's meeting in Mexico, a draft communique from the summit warned that global growth was still weak due to problems in the US, Europe, Japan..... Here's a couple of highlights: Global Outlook Global growth remains modest and downside risks are still elevated, including due to possible delays in the complex implementation of recent policy announcements in Europe, a potential sharp fiscal tightening in the United States, securing funding for this year's budget in Japan, weaker growth in some emerging markets. Public deficits We will ensure our public finances are on a sustainable path, in line with the medium-term Toronto commitments in the case of advanced economies. We will ensure the pace of fiscal consolidation is appropriate to support growth. Here's some alarming news -- an unnamed EU official has told Reuters that eurozone finance ministers are unlikely to take a final decision on Greece's next aid tranche when they meet on 12 November. The official, who was speaking in Mexico City where G20 finance ministers are holding a meeting, said eurozone members were still trying to guarantee Greece's 'debt sustainability'. In addition, a number of countries may need parliamentary approval (especially if Greece is to be granted more time to hit its targets). The news that the 12 November meeting probably won't deliver a decision is alarming, as Greece risks running out of money on 16 November when \u20ac4bn of bonds mature. However, this official reckons Greece can hang on a bit longer. Here's the story: \"The November 12 meeting will not be the final stage. We're not so much under the gun as it may seem,\" the official said, adding that Greece could meet its financial obligations without further financial assistance until the end of November or even early December. \"A deal is still likely in November, but not necessarily on November 12,\" the official also said. \"There will be no deal until there is a deal on all the different strings of the package. We will not disburse the next tranche until all details are in place\". Back in Greece, taxi drivers have been holding a demonstration in the city of Thessaloniki today. Here's a couple of pictures from the scene; As I mentioned at 1.03pm, Greek journalists have also been demonstrating in Athens. With the general strike beginning tomorrow, the tension is already rising... More gloomy economic data - this time from America. The ISM non-manufacturing index (which measures output across the US service sector) fell to 54.2 in October, down from 55.1 in September, and lower than economists expected. That still shows growth, but will bolster fears that the US economy could finish the year with a whimper rather than a bang. And with Britain's service sector also performing weakly in October (see 9.35am), the omens are not great. Standard &amp; Poor's has released a text explaining why it has downgraded Argentina's credit rating by one notch to B-, with a negative outlook. The move, which came last week, follows a crucial court ruling for Argentina over its treatment of its distressed bonds following its default a decade ago. A New York court ruled 10 days ago that Argentina cannot simply ignore the claims of investors who own those bonds and who have refused to restructure the debts (and take a large loss). S&amp;P said that the court's ruling means \"increased debt management risks\", which is a polite way of saying there's more danger of another default. S&amp;P added: In addition, we consider that recent negative events highlight the increasing challenges the government of Argentina will likely continue to face to define its economic policy management and financial program over the near term. These events include the payment in local currency of a province liability denominated in U.S. dollars issued under Argentinean law and the blocking of a navy ship in Ghana by litigants from the 2001 sovereign default. Although we don't expect the Appeal Court rule in New York to have an immediate impact on debt service because the procedure for implementing the equal treatment provision has not yet been defined, it will make it more difficult for Argentina to normalize its relationship with private, bilateral, and multilateral lenders. Argentina has been battling so-called vulture funds for years, and consistently argues that it has no obligation to repay speculators who snapped up its debt at a fraction of its face value after it defaulted. But the country's ongoing legal battles show that defaulting on debt is not a pain-free option for governments. The Economist has a good piece on the Argentinian situation. Here's a flavour: Ever since wars to collect unpaid debts went out of fashion, governments have been kept in check only by their need to borrow again in future. Such impunity is now under threat. More here: Hold-outs upheld. UPDATE: Just to clarify, the S&amp;P downgrade didn't come today, but the text explaining the move was released this afternoon. Trading has begun on Wall Street, and like Europe the mood is cautious.... Dow Jones Industrial Average: down 31 points at 13061, -0.24% FTSE 100: down 23 points at 5845, - 0.4% French CAC: down 29 points at 3462, - 0.86% German DAX: down 34 points at 7329, - 0.5% The US elections are the main factor encouraging traders to sit tight. Not just the race for the White House - congressional elections will determine how America approaches the looming fiscal cliff (the tax rises and spending cuts that land in January): Stephen Lewis of Monument Securities writes: Once the elections are past (assuming a clear-cut decision on who should occupy the White House), market attention is likely to switch to issues surrounding the fiscal cliff..... The outcome of the congressional elections may well be more significant than the presidential vote in determining what action, if any, is taken to turn the cliff into a gently-descending ramp. Antonis Roupakiotis's decision to sign the Greek austerity bill (see last post) means that it can now proceed to parliament. It's still not clear how Roupakiotis's Democratic Left party will vote this week, especially as the austerity package and the 2013 budget will be voted on separately. Its leader, Fotis Kouvelis, had said that his party would support the budget but not the austerity programme. However, the party's top brass are still considering the issue... Greek justice minister Antonis Roupakiotis appears to have bowed to pressure from his leader and signed the austerity package that reaches parliament later today. Here's the story on Lefimerida (and here's a Google translation into English). As mentioned at 12.51pm, there was speculation that Roupakiotis might refuse to sign the bill (which would be a resigning matter for a government minister). Louis Gallois, the former boss of EADS, has urged France's government to introduce a \"competitiveness shock\" to kick-start growth in the French economy. Gallois made the comments as he officially handed over his report into the French economy (see10.16am for the background). The experienced businessman argued that Fran\u00e7ois Hollande must shake-up labour relations and cut red tape to get French businesses moving again. Here's the key quote: I am proposing 22 principal measures ... to stop the slide, stop the stagnation, support investment...This is what I call, in my words, the competitiveness shock, which is really a confidence shock. Those measures include a hefty cut in the social security payments which employers pay for each worker - saving firms around \u20ac20bn. One man's red tape is another man's hard-won right and protections, so we now wait to see how Hollande responds to Gallois's report (which he commissioned himself). In the Netherlands, Mark Rutte's new government has been officially sworn in this morning, amid a row over the administration' new austerity programme. Queen Beatrix of the Netherlands swore in a new centrist Dutch government under Prime Minister Mark Rutte, after he reached a deal last with the Labour party. Here's a couple of photos from the inauguration ceremony in The Hague: Associated Press reported that the inauguration ceremony lasted less than three minutes and was broadcast live on Dutch television and online for the first time. Laudably brevity - except apparently the swearing-in had to be carried out twice because it happened too early for national broadcaster NOS (where there was presumably plenty of swearing too). Rutte begins his second stint as prime minister facing a dispute with members of his own party over a plan to link health care premiums to people's income -- meaning higher payments for the rich. That's not gone down well with his right-wingers. AP reports: Conservatives say the idea is fundamentally against their principles. Rutte has responded by saying that projections circulating in Dutch media of how much people will have to pay are wildly inaccurate. Halbe Zijlstra, leader of Rutte's party in the Dutch parliament attempted to ease the concerns Monday morning. \"There are calculations and stories flying around about people's spending power dropping by 23-30 percent. I can say that is definitely not going to happen,\" he told NOS radio. The health care changes are part of a \u20ac16bn austerity package. The euro has continued to lose ground against the US dollar today, and is currently trading around $1.277 - close to a two-month low. Financial markets are also in the red today, and little changed from this morning's lows. The US election, and the vote in Greece this week, are putting traders in a nervous mood. As Arne Lohmann Rasmussen, head of currency research at Danske Bank, Copenhagen, told Reuters: With the euro there is concern about what's going on in Greece, that they might not might not get the austerity vote through, and with the dollar the fiscal cliff is really getting some attention before the elections. Greek journalists protesting against changes to their social security fund have now reached the Athens parliament. Here's a pic (via the indispensable Theodora Oikonomides): There are reports from Athens today that the country's justice minister, Antonis Roupakiotis, may have to resign because he refuses to support the austerity package. That's via Yannis Koutsomitis: Roupakiotis is one of Democratic Left's cabinet representatives -- the left-wing party that has already said it cannot support the labour reforms within the \u20ac13.5bn package of measures. Roupakiotis himself only just returned to work after brain surgery on a blood clot. More photos from Greece -- showing how the streets of Athens are festooned with posters advertising Tuesday and Wednesday's general strike, while security preparations are underway at Syntagma Square. These photos from Athens show that transport links are already being disrupted by strike action, even though though the 48-hour walkout officially starts at midnight tonight (see 8.33am for more details): Over to Greece where our correspondent Helena Smith describes a mood of heightened political tensions ahead of this week\u2019s crucial vote. Helena writes: The count-down to the vote was never going to be easy but now that the deeply controversial \u20ac13.5bn package is about to go to parliament the gloves are off. On the one hand there are unionists pledging to plunge the crisis-plagued country into the \u201cmother of all strikes\u201d when employees and civil servants walk off the job tomorrow. On the other, politicians who are vowing to step up the anti-bailout fight. After four months of trying to tone down its anti-EU rhetoric, the main opposition far-left SYRIZA party appears to have thrown moderation to the winds, radically stepping up its opposition to policies it says will only make the plight of recession-hit Greece worse. Once again, militants appear to be getting the upper hand with the leftist bloc saying sacrifices for European Union membership \u201cmust have their limits.\u201d Senior cadres this morning were openly talking of \u201cclashing head on\u201d with the government with many describing Greece as leading the \u201canti-austerity\u201d battle in Europe. \u201cThe party tried to be open but Alexis Tsipras [Syriza's leader] has been browbeaten,\u201d the prominent political commentator Pandelis Kapsis told me. \u201cIt is now adopting a very hard line to hide its internal differences and that is very worrying,\u201d Kapsis, like many analysts, says if the package is passed with anything above 154 votes \u201cit will be great.\u201d \u201cI was much more worried two days ago but it now seems that [the socialist Pasok leader] Evangelos Venizelos has managed to minimize his losses and there will only be six or seven defections,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Democratic Left (Dimar) party is also saying it will stay in the government which has removed another fear.\u201d Helena adds: But even if prime minister Antonis Samaras\u2019 fragile coalition manages to muster the required majority, there are few who believe that its viability is assured. Infighting has been so bitter of late that insiders say it will need a dramatic turn-around in relations between the three governing parties for the alliance not to collapse. A small slice of credit rating news -- Turkey is officially Investment Grade, with Fitch just announcing that it has raised the country's rating by one notch to BBB-. Fitch said that Turkey's public finances are in better shape, and that the country is now \"more resilient\" to external shocks (click here for the statement). The news that Turkey's debt is no longer classed as 'junk' will be warmly welcomed by the Ankora government (which has been pushing to join the EU for many years). It also brought a bit of joviality so an otherwise subdued City: And if it survives that, there's always Christmas... Germany's intelligence agency is concerned that nefarious money launderers and Russian oligarchs will benefit if the International Monetary Fund bails Cyprus out. So reports German news magazine Der Spiegel, which says the German BND intelligence service believes there is $26bn of Russian money deposed in Cypriot banks. Much of it has a grubby tinge, it claims: In a confidential report, the BND said Russians have deposited $26 billion (\u20ac20.25 billion) in Cyprus banks, an amount greater than the island's annual gross domestic product. These deposits will be guaranteed if European bailout money is paid to shore up the island's banks. The BND also accused Cyprus of still providing opportunities for money laundering. Here's the full story: Aid to Cyprus Could Benefit Russian Oligarchs Cyprus's bailout has been delayed because its left-wing president, Dimitris Christofias, has refused to accept tough labour market reforms in return for IMF help. Ironic that Russia's new elite must wait for a communist president... Over in France, an official report will argue today that the government should slash taxes and reverse labour reforms to make the French economy more competitive. Louis Gallois, the former boss of EADS, was asked to investigate the failings of France's economy. His conclusions will be published this evening, but the early leaks show that Gallois will recommend 'shock therapy' to stimulate growth. That will include \u20ac30bn of cuts to payroll taxes over the next two years, which would be paid for through cuts in government spending and higher taxes on consumer spending. The French government is due to give its response on Tuesday. Reuters predicts that president Francois Hollande will reject any dramatic changes to tax and spending, despite concerns that France is stagnating: President Francois Hollande's aides say shifting more of the tax burden onto households is out of the question at a time when the country is grappling with its toughest austerity budget in years in order to meet deficit-cutting goals. This suggests Gallois's work will end up mouldering in a dusty bureau in the \u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace. As AFP puts it: The so-called Gallois report...is the latest in a list of reports commissioned by successive governments on what is wrong with the French economy and the urgent reforms needed. Typically, they point the way to deep structural reforms which run counter to French habits: they tend to be short-lived time bombs which are then locked away where they cannot upset the voters. This graph shows how output from the UK's service sector bounced back in mid-2009 and remained above the 50-point mark (which separates expansion from contraction) even when Britain was in recession. Andrew Harker of Markit said today's data (see 9.35am) was a blow to those hoping for \"strong and speedy economic recovery\": Although there are signs of improvements, panellists still referred to the fragility of both demand and confidence among clients. Competitive pressures were also highlighted, both by respondents and by the slight nature of output price inflation. The expectation among firms is for activity to improve over the coming year, but the road to full economic recovery still looks to be a long one. The picture is rather brighter in Ireland, though -- its service sector grew at its fastest rate in five years last month. Just in: the UK's service sector grew at its slowest level since December 2010 last month. The monthly service sector PMI came in at 50.6, according to Markit. That's a weaker figure than economists had expected, and follows disappointing manufacturing data last week. Britain may be out of recession, but this latest data shows that it could be a tough autumn. Reaction to follow Europe's stock markets have fallen this morning (like the euro), with traders hunkering down ahead of the US presidential election and the Greek budget vote. FTSE 100: down 41 points at 5827, - 0.7% German DAX: down 39 pints at 7324, - 0.5% French CAC: down 27 points at 3465, - 0.79% Spanish IBEX: down 98 points at 7869, - 1.2% Italian FTSE MIB: down 165 points at 15604, -1.05% Mike van Dulken, head of research at Accendo Markets, says it's a \"Risk-Off' morning, as investors wait to see whether Barack Obama or Mitt Romney triumph tomorrow night. He adds: Back in Europe, concerns still burn fiercely regarding Greece and Spain, and Merkel suggests that while we are on the right path, the crisis could still last another 5yrs. Nice! That's a reference to comments made by Angela Merkel over the weekend. The German chancellor told an event in Sternberg, Germany, that: We need a long breath of five years and more....We need rigor to convince the world it\u2019s worth investing in Europe. A bit more growth might also help convince 'the world' about Europe's prospects... Bruegel, the European think tank, has analysed Tim Geithner's telephone records, and shown that the US treasury secretary has been on the phone to the International Monetary Fund and the European Central Bank a lot. As this graph shows, Geithner phoned the IMF and the ECB far more frequently than any European politician between January 2010 and June this year. Bruegel's Jean Pisani-Ferry argues that the data shows that the ECB president has become \"Mr Euro\" in the eyes of the US Treasury: This finding is especially striking, as the ECB\u2019s institutional interlocutor is the Fed, not the US Treasury. The data also showed that Geithner spoke to the German, French or UK finance ministers regularly, but hardly ever called heads of the EC or the Eurogroup. Evidence that national governments still wield the real power in Europe. HSBC, Europe's largest bank, has warned this morning that there is an 'increased' risk of a country leaving the eurozone, and admitted that it cannot accurately assess how this would play out. The warning came in an interim management statement released this morning, in a section called \"Redenomination risk\". It reads: As a result of the continuing distressed conditions experienced by the peripheral eurozone countries, there is an increased possibility of a member state exiting from the eurozone. There is currently no established legal framework within the European is not possible to accurately predict the course of events and legal consequences that would ensue. Our current view is that there would be a greater impact on HSBC from a euro exit of Greece, Italy or Spain than from Ireland, Portugal or Cyprus, where our exposures are substantially lower. The full statement is online (pdf). Some Greek workers will go on strike today, ahead of the two-day walkout called for Tuesday and Wednesday. Power workers are due to begin rolling strikes this evening, with the union of Public Power Corporation employees denouncing the austerity package as a 'coup de grace' to people who are already below the poverty line. The union is also urging workers to take part in Tuesday and Wednesday's strike. The industrial action could potentially lead to power blackouts, as it will be much harder for any network damage to be repaired. Some Greek journalists are also striking today, in protest at plans to merge their social security fund with a national scheme. UPDATE: There are also some strikes on Athens metro lines today. Living In Greece's full list of strike action has more (as ever!). Greek government insiders say they are confident of winning parliamentary approval for the austerity package this week, but admit it will be close. With Democratic Left (one of the two junior coalition partners) refusing to back the programme, that leaves Samaras's New Democracy party and the socialist Pasok group. Greek newspaper Kathimerini says Pasok and ND believe that between 153 and 157 deputies will back the plan. With 300 MPs in the chamber, that shows the vote could be tight. Another sign of nerves this morning -- investors have been racing to put their money into German two-year government bonds, a classic 'safe-haven'. That has driven up the value of the bonds, and pushed down the yield (the measure of the interest paid on the bonds) into negative territory. German two-year bonds are now yielding just -0.01%, as this Bloomberg graph shows: A negative yield means that buyers are effectively paying for the privilege of holding the bonds. The euro is falling in early trading today, as traders fret that Greece's parliament may not approve the austerity package. The euro just hit a one-month low of 79.935p against sterling, meaning one pound is now worth \u20ac1.251. It has also lost value against the US dollar, dropping through the $1.28 mark -- that's also a one-month low. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the eurozone crisis - and other key events in the world economy. It's the start of a crucial week for Greece, where Antonis Samaras's government is presenting its new austerity package to parliament later today. This will kick-start several days of debate in among Athens MPs, culminating in a vote later this week* that will help determine whether Greece receives its next chunk of aid. The passage of the austerity package will be marked by passionate demonstrations on the streets of Athens, with a large two-day strike beginning tomorrow. * As thing stand, MPs are expected to hold their first vote on the austerity bill on Wednesday, with a final vote penciled in for Sunday. But timings may change... Prime minister Antonis Samaras attempted to rally public support behind the unpopular programme yesterday, telling his party that Greece's future depended on it remaining in the eurozone. Samaras warned members of his New Democracy party: We must save the country from catastrophe ... if we fail to stay in the euro nothing will make sense. The Greek PM also pledged that talk of Greece leaving the euro would \"end irreversibly\" once the package was approved by parliament: As soon as the new measures are passed and we get the critical aid tranche, liquidity will start again to feed businesses and households, uncertainty will end, sentiment will change and the fear of a return to the drachma will disappear. Analysts reckon that Samaras will win, narrowly. However last week's defection by a coalition MP highlighted just how unpopular the package is...and other lawmakers may also rebel in the days ahead. As usual, we'll be tracking the latest developments in Athens today, along with other important developments in the crisis.",

      "bodyText": "Britain's services sector almost ground to a standstill last month, dampening hopes that the economy is on the road to recovery. The Markit/CIPS Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) for the dominant services sector dropped to 50.6 last month from 52.2 in September, only just above the 50 mark that separates growth from contraction. It is the slowest pace of growth in almost two years and way below analyst expectations of a much smaller decline to 52. The UK economy grew by 1% in the third quarter, pulling the UK out of the longest double-dip recession since the second world war. But economists warned that the figures were helped by a boost from the Olympics and a rebound from lost output as a result of the jubilee weekend. Andrew Harker, economist at Markit, said: \"The latest UK services PMI data provide a warning to those who saw the strong growth in GDP during the third quarter as symbolising the start of a strong and speedy economic recovery. Although there are signs of improvements, [companies surveyed] still referred to the fragility of both demand and confidence among clients. The expectation among firms is for activity to improve over the coming year, but the road to full economic recovery still looks to be a long one.\" Some economists said the release pointed towards the UK economy shrinking again in the fourth quarter, raising the prospect of a triple-dip recession. Rob Wood at Berenberg Bank said: \"With manufacturing output suffering from weak exports and domestic demand and the service sector flirting with contraction, a fall in GDP in the fourth quarter now looks most likely.\" The data will reignite the debate over whether the Bank of England will expand the quantitative easing programme this week. Howard Archer of IHS Global Insight said: \"While we just about still lean towards the view that the Bank of England will hold off from more QE for now and monitor how the economy is developing and what impact the Funding for Lending Scheme is having, it is looking an extremely tight call.\" While new orders in the services sector did grow in October \u2013 largely due to overseas demand \u2013 they did so at a slower pace than in September and companies said incoming new business did not make up for the completion of existing projects. For the second month running, service companies cut jobs in October. Archer said: \"A second successive, albeit modest, drop in services employment in October is a warning sign that there is no guarantee that the recent remarkable resilience of the labour market can be sustained.\" Companies reported rising costs but were reluctant to pass them on to customers as a result of strong competition.

      "bodyText": "In the wake of the failed \u00a325bn merger with the Franco-German owner of Airbus, EADS, BAE Systems and its investors are looking beyond the western world. The UK's largest defence contractor sees the Middle East as an important growth market, building on the substantial position it has established on the back of the controversial al-Yamamah arms deal. That contract with the Saudi Arabian government brought BAE more than \u00a340bn of revenue, as well as a Serious Fraud Office investigation that ended abruptly under government orders in 2006.

      "bodyText": "One of BP's longest-running energy concessions is threatening to become a high-profile victim of tensions between the United Arab Emirates and Britain over criticism of the Middle East state's crackdown on Islamist extremist groups. BP was first given a stake in a vast onshore oil field in Abu Dhabi back in 1939, but the concession comes up for renewal in 2014 and BP has been excluded from the bidding list. The UAE is one of the top five oil exporters in the world and Abu Dhabi is the headquarters for BP's entire exploration and production operation across the Middle East \u2013 the birth place a century ago of the business as the Anglo-Persian Oil Company. BP said \"discussions are still continuing\" with the UAE authorities but its exclusion from the bid is a major blow. The company is already in the middle of a row with Azerbaijan over falling output there, and has been hit by a series of serious problems in recent years, most notably the Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico. The oil major is privately said to be still hopeful the British government can sweet-talk the UAE into changing its mind at a time when its chief rivals, Royal Dutch Shell, ExxonMobil and others have been accepted as prequalified to bid. UAE officials have also accepted privately that BP's failure to make the list of bidders is a problem associated with the UK government rather than the company. Oil analysts in London, who preferred not to be named, said it was generally accepted that BP was the victim of a wider political row. The UAE has indicated that it is still to make a final decision on the issue, giving it leverage to encourage the UK government to dissuade political commentators in Britain from giving what it perceives as support to Islamist groups such as al-Islah. According to Human Rights Watch, the group \u2013 whose name translates as Reform and Social Guidance \u2013 is a \"non-violent political assocation advocating greater adherence to Islamic precepts\". BP holds a 9.5% holding in the 1.4m barrels-a-day concession alongside four western oil majors and the local state-owned group Abu Dhabi National Oil Company. The loss of its interests would deprive the company of 125,000 barrels a day, which is around 3.5% of its total global production. This is a significant amount given that BP is struggling to keep its volumes from falling, especially at a time when it is in the middle of selling its 50% stake in TNK-BP, its highly productive Russian operation. The financial loss from Abu Dhabi, however, would be less pronounced as the company is only paid around $1 for each barrel produced under the terms of the concession, which is structured as a \"contractor fee\". Abu Dhabi is one of the few Gulf states that allow western companies to explore for oil, and BP's exit would be a blow to the company's image as a blue-chip operator in demand all over the world. BP does not have any business in other major Middle East producers such as Saudi Arabia, but it does have oil interests in Iraq. It also has gas production in Oman and is developing gas fields in Sharjah.",
