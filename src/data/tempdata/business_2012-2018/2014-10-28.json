As an indication of this trend, John Lewis\u2019s sales over the last couple of years have seen a substantial increase from web purchases.</p> <p>These changes to the career path of the average white collar worker demand that staff have more skills, whether it is in marketing or finance and accounting, or the confidence and ability to provide advice to customers.</p> <p>Alan Milburn, the social mobility adviser to the government, wrote a report tackling this very problem. As a dying act of the last Labour government, it failed to gain much notice. But it highlighted the need for a more professional workforce.</p> <p>His <a href=\"http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/+/http:/www.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/ media/227102/fair-access.pdf\" title=\"\">report is worth revisiting</a> for its holistic vision of an education and careers structure that attempts to cope with job losses at companies like Lloyds. If banking is going to become a utility function, then it puts even more pressure on policymakers to train people for what Britain is good at: knowledge jobs.</p> <p>Milburn identified legal services as one of many ripe for expansion, not just for the Oxbridge high-flyer, but the clever A-level student. Some firms have heeded his advice, but not many. The laissez-faire attitude of the current government means we won\u2019t bridge the gap from one industrial revolution to another without unnecessary pain.</p> <h2>Pension gamble<br></h2> <p>George Osborne\u2019s big idea for 2014, and for the Conservative party to keep its hands on power, is pension reform. In his March budget he set savers free to blow their retirement pots on whatever they like. Millions of people were judged to have thrown their hats in the air, such was the excitement at this new freedom. Thatcherite thinktanks hailed it as the recognition of a human right.</p> <p>Of course it was no such thing, especially when much of everyone\u2019s pension savings are funded by the taxpayer through tax relief. It is a sad fact that higher rate taxpayers benefit the most, with 40% of their savings attributed to the taxpayer\u2019s generosity.</p> <p>Then there is the possibility that savers fall on hard times after a binge and ask taxpayers for a second handout.</p> <p>Osborne studiously ignored <a href=\"http://www.challenger.com.au/funds/TechnicalUpdates/ CRIR_How_much_super_do_Aussies_have_Apr12.pdf\" title=\"\">studies in Australia</a> that show only half of retirees maintain their savings while the other half cash in their pensions to pay credit card debts, if not to fund a cruise and a sports car. A survey for financial adviser Hargreaves Lansdown shows Britain is likely to follow the same path. More than one in 10 respondents, equivalent to 200,000 retirees, said they would grab all of their private savings the moment they retire.</p> <p>It might make a big payday for whoever is the next chancellor. Withdrawing a lump sum in one year that was saved in a private or occupational scheme over a lifetime could push many savers into the higher tax band. Hargreaves Lansdown estimates they\u2019ll pay \u00a31.6bn in tax following the chancellor\u2019s move, compared with the Treasury\u2019s estimate of \u00a3350m. But it will be tax receipts from desperate or foolish people and cause huge pain for future generations.</p> <h2>House price reality<br></h2> <p>The crazy days of June and July have passed and a calmer housing market prevails. In particular, London house price inflation has come off the boil and the Land Registry figures for September verify the trend. So for the time being, the rise of the \u00a31m home has eased. It cannot last. London is gaining around 100,000 inhabitants a year. The UK population is also swelling. Britain is now home to 64.1 million people, five million higher than in 2001. With this level of pressure on housing, price inflation has only paused before taking off again.</p>",

But it highlighted the need for a more professional workforce. His report is worth revisiting for its holistic vision of an education and careers structure that attempts to cope with job losses at companies like Lloyds. If banking is going to become a utility function, then it puts even more pressure on policymakers to train people for what Britain is good at: knowledge jobs. Milburn identified legal services as one of many ripe for expansion, not just for the Oxbridge high-flyer, but the clever A-level student. Some firms have heeded his advice, but not many. The laissez-faire attitude of the current government means we won\u2019t bridge the gap from one industrial revolution to another without unnecessary pain. Pension gamble George Osborne\u2019s big idea for 2014, and for the Conservative party to keep its hands on power, is pension reform. In his March budget he set savers free to blow their retirement pots on whatever they like. Millions of people were judged to have thrown their hats in the air, such was the excitement at this new freedom. Thatcherite thinktanks hailed it as the recognition of a human right. Of course it was no such thing, especially when much of everyone\u2019s pension savings are funded by the taxpayer through tax relief. It is a sad fact that higher rate taxpayers benefit the most, with 40% of their savings attributed to the taxpayer\u2019s generosity. Then there is the possibility that savers fall on hard times after a binge and ask taxpayers for a second handout. Osborne studiously ignored studies in Australia that show only half of retirees maintain their savings while the other half cash in their pensions to pay credit card debts, if not to fund a cruise and a sports car. A survey for financial adviser Hargreaves Lansdown shows Britain is likely to follow the same path. More than one in 10 respondents, equivalent to 200,000 retirees, said they would grab all of their private savings the moment they retire. It might make a big payday for whoever is the next chancellor. Withdrawing a lump sum in one year that was saved in a private or occupational scheme over a lifetime could push many savers into the higher tax band. Hargreaves Lansdown estimates they\u2019ll pay \u00a31.6bn in tax following the chancellor\u2019s move, compared with the Treasury\u2019s estimate of \u00a3350m. But it will be tax receipts from desperate or foolish people and cause huge pain for future generations. House price reality The crazy days of June and July have passed and a calmer housing market prevails. In particular, London house price inflation has come off the boil and the Land Registry figures for September verify the trend. So for the time being, the rise of the \u00a31m home has eased. It cannot last. London is gaining around 100,000 inhabitants a year. The UK population is also swelling. Britain is now home to 64.1 million people, five million higher than in 2001. With this level of pressure on housing, price inflation has only paused before taking off again.",

That\u2019s all from the business live today. Thank you for following. David Cameron has been urged to take a stand against modern-day slavery and the abuse of migrant workers in Qatar. As David Cameron prepares to meet the Emir of Qatar, the Trade Union Congress said the prime minister should use his influence to seek to end the abuse of migrant workers in the Gulf state. In an open letter to 10 Downing Street, the TUC called on Cameron to press the Emir of Qatar to take action against slavery and abuse of construction workers. Conditions for foreign workers in Qatar, including those building the infrastructure needed for the 2022 World Cup, continue to be of grave concern. Figures confirmed by Qatar show that 964 workers from India and Nepal alone died between 2012 and 2013, a rate of 40 every month, with unsafe working and living conditions equally to blame. Many other workers are left for months without pay. These workers are completely trapped by the sponsorship system known as kafala which gives employers complete power to grant or deny workers the right to leave Qatar. The TUC wants to see an end to the kafala system, freedom for workers to join unions, and guarantees that the government will only use ethical recruitment companies. TUC General Secretary Frances O\u2019Grady said: Silence from David Cameron will be taken as support for what is effectively slavery in Qatar. Britain must be part of the international campaign to ensure that Qatar improves living and working conditions for migrant workers. Is it time to say goodbye to US financial stimulus? The US Federal Reserve\u2019s interest-rate setting committee begins a two-day meeting, expected to conclude tomorrow with an announcement ending its asset-buying programme. The Fed has purchased $1.6 trillion in Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities since September 2012, which has helped keep US interest rates down, allowing the economy to recover. When Fed policymakers hinted they might end financial stimulus in 2013, investors threw taper tantrums, selling off equities and dumping foreign currencies. Now the mood has changed. The consensus among market watchers is that the Fed will announce an end to its asset-buying programme, quantitative easing, when its meeting wraps up on Wednesday. The central bank is also expected to issue guidance on the timing of interest-rate rises. All this comes just ahead of an update on third-quarter US economic growth on Friday, which is expected to show growth of 3.1%. Economists are split on exactly when the Fed will wind up its bond-buying programme, according to a Wall Street Journal poll. About two-fifths of economists\u201439%\u2014expect the Fed\u2019s bond purchases to end entirely in the third quarter of 2014. About one-third\u201434%\u2014expect the central bank to halt the program in the fourth quarter, and 19% expect the end to come in early 2015. Economists are equally divided on when the Fed will begin raising rates. Some Fed officials are reported to want to stand by an earlier pledge not to raise rates until mid 2015. Others may are said to want to drop any reference to time, because they think it depends on the economic data. Whatever they decide the consequences are likely to reverberate in markets around the world. Nicholas Ebisch, currency analyst at Caxton FX, expects \u201cprofound effects\u201d on currency and stock markets in the US and around the world. The dollar is stable at the moment and has maintained a strong position since its steady appreciation in the second half of the year, but any sign of prolonging the QE programme, or extending low interest rates for longer should damage the greenback.

Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena, founded in 1472, has been in the spotlight after failing European banking stress tests. Regulators said it needed to raise \u20ac2.1 bn ($2.7 billion) to meet capital thresholds - a key benchmark of the bank\u2019s financial health. According to Reuters, Italy\u2019s Treasury may extend repayment deadlines on hundreds of millions of euros in state aid to help troubled lender. Officials, who declined to be cited by name, said Monte dei Paschi Chairman Alessandro Profumo and Chief Executive Fabrizio Viola had held meetings in the Economy Ministry on Monday to seek options for the bank, after it failed European Central Bank stress tests. It could be helped via Monti bonds, which are named after former prime minister Mario Monti, rather than the bank. The person close to the situation gave no details of the talks but said nothing had been ruled out, including options connected with repayment of 750 million euros of state aid, offered in the form of \u201cMonti Bonds\u201d in 2013 to prop up the bank after a previous crisis. Asked whether a delay in the repayment schedule or converting the loan into share capital in the bank was being looked at, the person said: \u201cAll options are under consideration. The bank is working on it. The system is solid. No comment was available from Monte dei Paschi. Shares in the bank are now up 2.23%, after yesterday\u2019s dramatic losses when the bank saw a quarter of its value wiped out. Over on the Guardian\u2019s data blog, new figures reveal how Spain\u2019s years of recession have damaged the country. Child poverty, already above the EU average, has risen, meaning that more than 2.7m Spanish children - one in three - lived in poverty or were at the risk of social exclusion in 2013. School drop-out rates are now by far the highest in the EU, with 23.6% leaving education early. That, plus more data and graphics here Are France and Italy off the hook? Both countries may have averted a fight with the European Commission over their budget deficits. Under eurozone rules, countries must have their budgets vetted in Brussels to check whether they meet basic rules of the currency, for instance a budget deficit of no more than 3% of GDP by 2015. The 2015 budget plans of France and Italy were both falling short. But following pressure from the Commission, France has now promised extra spending cuts worth \u20ac3.6-\u20ac3.7bn (\u00a32.8-2.9bn). French finance minister Michel Sapin wrote to the Commission on Monday, spelling out \u201cadditional measures\u201d, including more ambition on cutting its structural deficit target. Italy has also made a last-minute promise of extra cuts worth \u20ac4.5bn (\u00a33.5bn). A European Commission spokesman today welcomed the \u201cuseful, constructive contributions on budget talks from Italy and France\u201d. Via Reuters But analysts have said the changes do not add up to much. Aurel BGC brokers economist Jean-Louis Mourier on France. These are cosmetic changes aimed at responding to the Commission\u2019s demands with as little as possible. We might have 4.1% of (headline) deficit instead of 4.3% but we won\u2019t be at 3% . The Chinese authorities are clamping down on officials playing the ancient game of mahjong, as part of continuing anti-corruption drive that has hit the sales of luxury goods firms. The People\u2019s Daily, a mouthpiece for the Communist party regime, accused officials for playing the game when they should be working. The phenomenon of Communist officials going to rural retreats to have fun, play mahjong and poker... must resolutely stop. The article called for an equally \u201cresolute\u201d end to government staff \u201cspending public money to visit historical sites in the name of \u2018study\u2019, and then simply going to any old fun place.\u201d AFP explains what the crackdown is about: The commentary was the latest in a series of state-issued broadsides against official extravagance, as China\u2019s President Xi Jinping attempts to improve the Communist party\u2019s image in response to widespread anger over endemic corruption. The campaign has led to an unprecedented investigation into retired security czar Zhou Yongkang, though the vast majority of officials punished since Xi came to power have been from the government\u2019s lowest levels. The campaign against graft has been blamed for falling sales of luxury items, and hit business at expensive hotels and restaurants, according to reports. European markets are up, with Italy and Germany\u2019s benchmark index leading the way. Germany\u2019s DAX +1.39% at 9026 points France\u2019s CAC40 +0.26% at 4107 points Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB +1.66%% at 19.345 points UK FTSE100 +0.44% at 6388 points The markets have reversed yesterday\u2019s decline, mostly thanks to healthy corporate earnings lifting shares. The risk of deflation in Sweden has not disappeared, despite today\u2019s unprecedented decision to move to zero interest rates. Jessica Hines at Capital Economics warns that Sweden may have to resort to stiffer measures, such as currency intervention to avoid deepening deflation and a Japan-style lost decade. The Riksbank had little choice but to cut today. It has been roundly criticised for not responding quickly enough to the low level of inflation and a failure to act would have undermined its credibility further. Moreover, it would also have put upward pressure on the krona, which the Riksbank would not have wanted given that exporters are still struggling. With the policy rate at zero, the Riksbank will need to start thinking about what action it might taken if inflation continues to be weaker than it has forecast. The Bank of England is concerned that climate change could damage the earnings and solvency of the UK insurance industry. The FT reports that the bank\u2019s Prudential Regulation Authority, has written to insurance companies asking them whether they have considered climate change could affect their investment portfolios. Here is a flavour: Scientists have been warning for years that greenhouse gas emissions from burning fossil fuels are driving warmer global temperatures and could increase the frequency of devastating natural disasters such as Typhoon Haiyan, which killed thousands of people when it ploughed into the Philippines last year. But the Bank of England appears to be one of the first central banks to address potential climate risks for insurers. The insurance industry is doubly exposed to such threats. First, it faces rising payouts to policy holders battered by natural catastrophes that have caused average global insured losses of $56bn a year over the past decade, according to Munich Re . However, it also invests in assets that could be affected by such disasters, such as properties, and fossil fuel companies facing tougher government rules on greenhouse gas pollution, like those the US launched this year to reduce power plant emissions. According to the paper, the bank also confirmed reports that governor Mark Carney told a World Bank seminar in October there was analysis showing most fossil fuel reserves are \u201cunburnable\u201d if the world is to avoid risky climate change. Nice chart from Jamie McGeever at Reuters on why Sweden has embarked on zero interests. Spare capacity in the electricity grid system has fallen, but the National Grid has said there is no risk of blackouts. As my colleague Sean Farrell reports: In its winter outlook, the operator of pipes and pylons said that electricity margins \u2013 the difference between peak demand and available supply \u2013 had fallen to 4.1% from 5% at peak periods last year because of planned generator closures, breakdowns and delays to new plants. Gas supplies remain strong after last year\u2019s mild winter, with gas capacity higher than the maximum expected demand, National Grid said. National Grid: no risk of winter blackouts Energy Minister Matt Hancock has been touring the studios with the same message. There will be secure energy supplies this winter. There will be no power cuts to householders. Of course, there may be bad weather and we have taken measures to ensure that the distribution networks are stronger than they were last winter... He also said security of supply was more important than tackling climate change or cutting costs for consumers. My view is that those three things aren\u2019t equal - cost, climate change and energy security. For me, energy security comes first because if you don\u2019t have secure supplies then the other two become completely second order. Hancock quotes via PA Ouch. Shares in the Asia-focused bank Standard Chartered have slumped to a 5-year low, after the bank reported falling profits. Standard Chartered\u2019s London-listed shares are down more than 9% to 993 pence this morning. The bank surged ahead over the last decade thanks to high grow in China, India and South Korea, but now faces falling profits as a result of weakness in those economies. The bank also said it has rising compliance costs, in the wake of a failure of its money-laundering controls that led to a $300m fine. Peter Thal Larsen of Reuters Breaking Views, says weaker [Asian] economies, rising expenses and bigger bad debts are all to blame. Even with extra cost-cutting, it\u2019s too early to say when StanChart\u2019s fortunes will improve. Until the bottom line stabilises, investors will remains wary . Sweden\u2019s central bank explains that it cut interest rates to zero because inflation is too low. The bank has a target of 2% inflation The Swedish economy is relatively strong and economic activity is continuing to improve. But inflation is too low. The Executive Board of the Riksbank has therefore decided that monetary policy needs to be even more expansionary for inflation to rise towards the target of 2 per cent. Despite the fact that both GDP and employment have increased at a relatively good rate over the last 12 months, inflation has continued to be lower than expected. The broad downturn in inflation and the repeated downward revisions to the inflation forecast imply that underlying inflationary pressures are very low and lower than previously assessed. This, taken together with lower inflation and a weaker development of economic activity abroad, means that it is expected to take longer for inflation to reach 2 per cent. Market watchers have taken note. Sweden\u2019s central bank has taken markets by surprise by slashing interest rates to zero, sending the Swedish krona to a four-year low against the dollar. The Riksbank had been forecast to cut rates to 0.1% from 0.25%, but went the whole way and reduced them to nothing to help avoid the risk of deflation. Asia-focused bank Standard Chartered has reported a 16% slide in profits, as the bank struggles to respond to slowing growth across the region and increased compliance costs. Standard Chartered reported \u00a31.5bn profits for its third quarter, down from \u00a31.83bn the previous year. The lender has also been hit by losses in South Korea, where it has been reorganising its business since 2011. Peter Sands, Standard Chartered chief executive, said the bank was taking action to get back to profitable growth. Whilst trading conditions remained subdued, we did see a modest return to year on year income growth during the quarter. We are executing our refreshed strategy, including reprioritising investments, exiting non-core businesses, de-risking certain portfolios and reallocating capital. To create more capacity for investment in the many opportunities in our markets, we are taking further action on costs, targeting more than US$400 million in productivity improvements for 2015. Lloyds Banking Group- eight things we have learned from the results The UK\u2019s third-largest energy company BG Group reported a lower-than-expected fall in profits, hit by falling oil prices and falling production from its Egyptian refineries. From Reuters BG\u2019s total operating profit came to $1.3 billion in the third quarter, undershooting a company-provided consensus of $1.4 billion, as its Egyptian output halved compared with the previous year to 55,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (boepd) due to its depleting reservoir. In the third quarter BG sold its oil at an average of $104 per barrel, down from $112 the previous year, while its average UK gas price fell 17 percent to 37 pence per therm. The oil and gas producer has however started to reap benefits of costly projects in Brazil and Australia. BG\u2019s third-quarter revenue rose 4 percent to $4.6 billion as oil output from Brazil rose to more than 100,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. It is also on track to deliver its first liquefied natural gas (LNG) cargo from the Queensland Curtis LNG project by the end of the year. BG also announced that they had appointed Helge Lund as chief executive. He replaces Chris Finlayson, who left earlier this year to join InterOil. Lloyds shares are down 1.15% to 74.7 pence this morning. The FTSE100 as a whole has nudged up 0.6% to 6401 points. BP has been hit by a steep drop in revenues from its Russian partner Rosneft. The oil company reported that underlying net income from Rosneft for its third quarter was $110m, against $808 m last year. The sharp drop off has been blamed on the depreciation of the rouble against the dollar and lower oil prices. BP profits were in line with expectations at around $3bn, although lower than last year\u2019s $3.7bn. The oil major upped its dividend by 10 cents a share, a 5.3% increase on last year. Bob Dudley, BP chief executive, said BP\u2019s operational momentum was delivering results. Growing underlying production of oil and gas and a good downstream performance generated strong cash flow in the third quarter, despite lower oil prices. This keeps us well on track to hit our targets for 2014. BP said western sanctions on Russia had had \u201cno material impact\u201d on its business. During the quarter BP also hit a significant milestone, when compensation for the Deepwater Horizon spill reached $20bn. BP\u2019s total bill for the disaster is $43bn. More reaction on Lloyds From Which\u2019s executive director Lloyds bank will lose around 150 branches, although the company says that most customers will still have a bank within five miles. This brings an end to Lloyds\u2019 pledge to be the last bank in town. We are committed to maintaining or growing our share of branches and will optimise our network by consolidating mainly urban branches in overlapping locations. We anticipate this will lead to a net reduction of about 150 branches. Over 90 per cent of Lloyds and Bank of Scotland customers will continue to have a useable branch within five miles of their home, while the Halifax branch network will be maintained. Here are some of the other headlines from the Lloyds announcement this morning, courtesy of Reuters. Lloyds finance director expects bank to pass PRA stress tests Lloyds finance director hopeful of paying 2014 dividend Lloyds anticipates closing fewer branches than competitors Lloyds says increased PPI provision due to increase in \u201creactive\u201d complaints Here is how the Unite union has reacted to Lloyds job cuts - via the Guardian\u2019s City editor. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and the business world. Lloyds Bank have announced they are cutting 9,000 jobs \u2013 in addition to the 45,000 that have gone since the 2008 bailout and rescue of HBOS. The bailed out lender, which is 24%-owned by the taxpayer, also revealed that it was putting aside a further \u00a3900m for to compensate customers for misselling PPI insurance policies, bringing the total bill to \u00a311bn. Here is how Lloyds announced the job losses: Within the organisation, we will rebalance roles to reflect the evolving nature of the business and ensure we have the people and capabilities required for the transition to a more digitised, IT enabled business. We anticipate a reduction of approximately 9,000 full time roles across the business while building new capability in digital and IT. Later this morning Lloyds boss Ant\u00f3nio Horta-Os\u00f3rio will explain all, in a presentation to the City that will also set out a new three-year plan for technological change. The banking industry faces more change in the next 10 years than it has seen in the last 200, according to Lord Blackwell, the chair Lloyds Bank. From Lloyds statement: Our plan outlines how we intend to deliver value and high quality experiences for customers alongside superior and sustainable financial performance within a prudent risk and conduct framework. We remain committed to Helping Britain Prosper*, supporting the UK economy and the communities in which we operate. *Lloyds\u2019 capitalisation We will also be delving into results from BP and BG, as well as looking ahead to the Federal Reserve\u2019s monthly meeting starting later today.

      "bodyText": "The UK economy continues to recover, albeit at a slower pace, the latest official figures show. But how well does this reflect how people are feeling? GDP measurements only provide part of the picture and so the Office for National Statistics will soon reveal details of a new set of supplementary indicators on economic well-being. It follows a pledge by the prime minister, David Cameron, in 2010 to make the UK one of the first countries to officially monitor happiness. The inaugural release including how households are doing, how well-off people feel and other insights into well-being will be published just in time for Christmas on 23 December. Bhutan is the real trailblazer in this area. The tiny nation to the east of the Himalayas has long been renowned for its focus not on GDP \u2013 gross domestic product \u2013 but GNH (gross national happiness). In other words, what matters to Bhutan more than upping production and improving productivity is whether its citizens are happy. It\u2019s a measure the remote south Asian nation has been using since the early 1970s, well before the rest of the world began to realise that wealthier does not necessarily translate into happier. The ONS says its new regular well-being release will help businesses, households and policymakers in the UK make better-informed decisions by providing a whole \u201cdashboard\u201d of indicators on the state of the economy. Confirming the new measure recently, ONS chief economic adviser Joe Grice said: While it\u2019s right that GDP plays a central role in monetary and fiscal policy, it has long been recognised as presenting an incomplete picture of how our society is doing. The UK will be one of the first countries to bring together official statistics on other measures that will tell us, for example, how households are doing, including how well off people are feeling. In the meantime, we consider what various indicators can already tell us about economic well-being in the UK. 1. Overall well-being is relatively high The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) has been working on ways of measuring economic and more general well-being with it\u2019s How\u2019s Life project, or Better Life Initiative, that analyses indicators including income, jobs, housing, health, work-life balance and education. Its latest snapshot of the UK summed up how the country fares well relative to other nations in the largely rich OECD group. Summarising the UK\u2019s position, the OECD says: Compared with other OECD countries, Brazil and the Russian Federation, the United Kingdom performs well in many of the 11 dimensions ... that the OECD considers as essential to a good life. The United Kingdom ranks above the average of the 36 countries in the dimensions of personal security, environmental quality, civic engagement, social connections, health status, income and wealth, jobs and earnings, housing, and subjective well-being, but below average in education and skills, and work-life balance. 2. GDP per head is below its pre-crisis peak While GDP is now above its pre-crisis peak, the UK\u2019s population has grown faster than the economy. So measured per person, GDP this year will probably be around 1% below of its pre-crisis level, economists say. This line charting quarterly GDP per head clearly shows the lost ground left to make up. 3. Household incomes have been falling GDP measures the production in a country and therefore also the income generated from that production. But there is a growing awareness that household incomes are just as important, if not more so, to gauge economic well-being. The ONS highlights the significance of median real household income, the income that the middle household receives if all households are ranked from highest to lowest (or the reverse) in terms of the income they receive. Using a median, rather than a simple average, gives a better picture of how available resources are distributed across people and households. As this chart shows, median real household income held up during the first phase of the recession but it declined as GDP itself began a slow recovery, as shown on the second chart. 4. Britain\u2019s stock of wealth has stagnated GDP measures the flows of output or income but not the UK\u2019s corresponding stock of wealth and net assets. As the ONS points out, that means it is possible for a nation to be increasing its output and consumption while running down its assets, but this output and consumption would not be sustainable. Or the reverse might be the case and GDP would then underestimate the true position in regard to sustainable future consumption and thus well-being. So it is important to look at the wealth held in a country. This ONS chart of UK physical and financial capital shows this measure of wealth rising fairly steadily in real terms in the years to 2007, then falling against the backdrop of financial crisis and recession. It recovered somewhat but by 2012 had not returned to growth. 5. Household wealth has fared better Household wealth measures help to show how much money people have available to spend, before considering changes in incomes, and so offer another insight into well-being. This chart from the ONS shows that there was an increase in household wealth from 1997 to 2007, driven mainly by rising house prices. The onset of the recession in 2008 recorded a drop in net worth of households but in 2012 it recovered. 6. Making ends meet is tough for one in five A theme of the crisis and recovery has been the financial pain felt by many households from falling real wages (pay after inflation) and government cuts. The UK is by no means alone in feeling the effects of austerity and this chart ranks it relative to other European countries. A fifth of households in the UK in 2012 reported great difficulty or difficulty in making ends meet, lower than the estimated EU\u201328 average of 27.7%, the ONS said in a European comparisons of well-being report in June. 7. Pay has plunged and the prospects for rises are shaky Pay rises have failed to match inflation and so wages have been falling in real terms for years. Despite the recovery and rising employment, many people are worse off. This first chart shows how inflation has outpaced wages. The second shows how median pay appears to have become de-coupled from productivity growth, a trend highlighted by labour market expert Professor Paul Gregg at the University of Bath. This begs the question: If productivity recovers will wages for the typical worker really follow? 8. Job quality varies but is better than European average Work is where many people spend a large part of their time and so, says the OECD, gauging working environments is key to measuring well-being. The thinktank looks at control over decisions, support from managers, earnings, job security and other factors. Its How\u2019s Life report on the UK noted that in 2010, 18% of British workers reported being in a poor working environment, a share slightly below the average in European countries. This chart shows how low job quality damages the physical and mental health of workers. So how are we feeling? The UK fares better than many other developed countries when it comes to economic and other measures of well-being. But there are plenty of reasons why many households are still finding things tough six years after the crisis kicked off. Real wages are falling, household incomes have dipped and GDP per person is still some way off its pre-downturn peak. Expect the official happiness report in December to paint a mixed picture.",

The tiny nation to the east of the Himalayas has long been renowned for its focus not on GDP \u2013 gross domestic product \u2013 but GNH (<strong>gross national happiness)</strong>. In other words, <strong>what matters to Bhutan more than upping production and improving productivity is whether its citizens are happy</strong>. It\u2019s a measure the remote south Asian nation has been <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/dec/01/bhutan-wealth-happiness-counts\">using since the early 1970s</a>, well before the rest of the world began to realise that wealthier does not necessarily translate into happier.</p> <p>The ONS says its new regular well-being release will help businesses, households and policymakers in the UK make better-informed decisions by providing a whole <strong>\u201cdashboard\u201d of indicators on the state of the economy</strong>.<br></p> <p>Confirming the new measure recently, <strong>ONS chief economic adviser Joe Grice </strong>said:<br></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>While it\u2019s right that GDP plays a central role in monetary and fiscal policy, it has long been recognised as presenting an incomplete picture of how our society is doing. The UK will be one of the first countries to bring together official statistics on other measures that will tell us, for example, how households are doing, including how well off people are feeling.<br></p> </blockquote> <p>In the meantime, we consider <strong>what various indicators can already tell us about economic well-being in the UK</strong>.</p> <h2>1. Overall well-being is relatively high<br></h2> <p>The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) has been working on ways of measuring economic and more general well-being with it\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.oecd.org/statistics/how-s-life-23089679.htm\">How\u2019s Life project</a>, or Better Life Initiative, that analyses indicators including income, jobs, housing, health, work-life balance and education. Its latest <a href=\"http://www.oecd.org/statistics/BLI%202014%20UK%20country%20report.pdf\">snapshot of the UK</a> summed up how the country <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/nov/05/uk-scores-highly-quality-of-life-oecd\">fares well relative to other nations</a> in the largely rich OECD group. <br></p> <p>Summarising the UK\u2019s position, the OECD says:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Compared with other OECD countries, Brazil and the Russian Federation, the United Kingdom performs well in many of the 11 dimensions ... that the OECD considers as essential to a good life. The United Kingdom <strong>ranks above the average</strong> of the 36 countries in the dimensions of <strong>personal security, environmental quality, civic engagement, social connections, health status, income and wealth, jobs and earnings, housing, and subjective well-being</strong>, but <strong>below average in education and skills, and work-life balance</strong>. <br><br></p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"How the UK ranks on well-being among OECD countries.\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://static.guim.co.uk/ni/1414490345194/UK_Wellbeing_Ranking.svg&quot;style=&quot;width:100%;&quot;&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> <figcaption>How the UK ranks on well-being among OECD countries, using Germany for comparison.</figcaption> </figure>  <h2>2. GDP per head is below its pre-crisis peak<br></h2> <p>While GDP is now above its pre-crisis peak, the UK\u2019s population has grown faster than the economy. So measured per person, <strong>GDP this year will probably be around 1% below of its pre-crisis level</strong>, economists say. <br></p> <p>This line charting quarterly GDP per head clearly shows the lost ground left to make up.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"GDP per head in the UK\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://static.guim.co.uk/ni/1414436057580/Economics_GDP_2810.svg&quot;style=&quot;width:100%;&quot;&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> <figcaption>GDP per head in the UK.</figcaption> </figure>  <h2>3. Household incomes have been falling<br></h2> <p>GDP measures the production in a country and therefore also the income generated from that production. But there is a growing awareness that household incomes are just as important, if not more so, to gauge economic well-being. </p> <p>The ONS highlights the significance of <a href=\"http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/wellbeing/measuring-national-well-being/economic-well-being/measuring-national-well-being---economic-well-being.html#tab-B--Emphasising-the-Household-Dimension\">median real household income</a>, the income that the middle household receives if all households are ranked from highest to lowest (or the reverse) in terms of the income they receive. Using a median, rather than a simple average, gives a better <a href=\"http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/household-income/middle-income-households/1977---2011-12/sty-middle-income-households.html\">picture of how available resources are distributed across people and households</a>. </p> <p>As this chart shows, <strong>median real household income held up during the first phase of the recession </strong>but it<strong> declined as GDP itself began a slow recovery</strong>, as shown on the second chart. <br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Household incomes and GDP in the UK\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://static.guim.co.uk/ni/1414438229567/Economics_Household_2810.svg&quot;style=&quot;width:100%;&quot;&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> <figcaption>Household incomes and GDP in the UK</figcaption> </figure>  <h2>4. Britain\u2019s stock of wealth has stagnated<br></h2> <p>GDP measures the flows of output or income but not the UK\u2019s corresponding stock of wealth and net assets. As the <a href=\"http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/wellbeing/measuring-national-well-being/economic-well-being/measuring-national-well-being---economic-well-being.html#tab-A--General-Issues\">ONS points out</a>, that means it is possible for a nation to be increasing its output and consumption while running down its assets, but this output and consumption would not be sustainable. Or the reverse might be the case and GDP would then underestimate the true position in regard to sustainable future consumption and thus well-being. So it is important to look at the wealth held in a country.<br></p> <p>This ONS chart of UK physical and financial capital shows this measure of <strong>wealth rising fairly steadily in real terms in the years to 2007, then falling against the backdrop of financial crisis and recession</strong>. It recovered somewhat but by 2012 had <strong>not returned to growth</strong>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3df7a215bc39d40cf916ec5ae04f376237b7e5f3\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/10/27/1414427341342/0095a0c5-65ac-49a5-ad21-54b44c2cf38c-460x341.png\" alt=\"Net financial and produced assets (2010 prices), 1997 - 2012\" width=\"460\" height=\"341\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Net financial and produced assets (2010 prices), 1997 - 2012</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: ONS</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>5. Household wealth has fared better<br></h2> <p>Household wealth measures help to show how much money people have available to spend, before considering changes in incomes, and so offer another insight into well-being. <br>  This <a href=\"http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/wellbeing/measuring-national-well-being/economic-well-being/measuring-national-well-being---economic-well-being.html#tab-B--Emphasising-the-Household-Dimension\">chart from the ONS</a> shows that <strong>there was an increase in household wealth from 1997 to 2007, driven mainly by rising house prices</strong>. The onset of the <strong>recession in 2008 recorded a drop in net worth of households but in 2012 it recovered</strong>. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7589303ae85b0ecc826f12c5feb99f9adf5a2b57\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/10/27/1414428208553/d58652f2-224e-4511-a344-d1f427cdb639-460x390.png\" alt=\"Real household wealth (2010 prices), 1997 - 2012\" width=\"460\" height=\"390\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Real household wealth (2010 prices), 1997 - 2012</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: ONS</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>6. Making ends meet is tough for one in five<br></h2> <p>A theme of the crisis and recovery has been the financial pain felt by many households from falling real wages (pay after inflation) and government cuts. The UK is by no means alone in feeling the effects of austerity and this chart ranks it relative to other European countries.</p> <p><strong>A fifth of households in the UK in 2012 reported great difficulty or difficulty in making ends meet</strong>, lower than the estimated EU\u201328 average of 27.7%, the ONS said in a <a href=\"http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/wellbeing/measuring-national-well-being/european-comparisons--2014/index.html\">European comparisons of well-being report</a> in June.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8dcb65655409de23e9cf5f9516b98c783a20d925\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/10/27/1414431340796/b7d8d913-9a42-4e43-817d-a9b7a413619d-460x150.png\" alt=\"Economic well-being: How the UK ranks within the EU\" width=\"460\" height=\"150\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Economic well-being: How the UK ranks within the EU</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: ONS</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>7. Pay has plunged and the prospects for rises are shaky <br></h2> <p>Pay rises have failed to match inflation and so<strong> wages have been falling in real terms for years</strong>. Despite the recovery and rising employment, many people are worse off. </p> <p>This <a href=\"http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/lms/labour-market-statistics/october-2014/statistical-bulletin.html#tab-6--Average-Weekly-Earnings\">first chart</a> shows how <strong>inflation has outpaced wages</strong>. The second shows how <strong><a href=\"http://www.bath.ac.uk/ipr/our-publications/policy-briefs/wage-recovery.html\">median pay appears to have become de-coupled from productivity growth</a></strong>, a trend highlighted by labour market expert Professor Paul Gregg at the University of Bath. This begs the question: <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/oct/26/lowest-paid-rise-productivity-puzzle-low-wage-growth-uk\">If productivity recovers will wages for the typical worker really follow</a>?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e5d26e2153008e22283d2cc0fd53cbe5163534fc\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/10/27/1414432388457/99560112-6380-494d-8b50-25c77939e7ce-460x258.png\" alt=\"Average earnings and consumer prices annual growth rates\" width=\"460\" height=\"258\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Average earnings and consumer prices annual growth rates</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: ONS</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1b00a5e6efab5e71778674deaf2f85e391c3d6a5\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/10/27/1414432548974/2ca3f99a-3cfb-4733-90d0-6a9126dc3c14-460x369.png\" alt=\"De-coupling of wages from productivity\" width=\"460\" height=\"369\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">De-coupling of wages from productivity</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Paul Gregg, Institute for Policy Research, University of Bath from various sources as listed above</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>8. Job quality varies but is better than European average<br></h2> <p>Work is where many people spend a large part of their time and so, says the OECD, gauging working environments is key to measuring well-being. The thinktank looks at control over decisions, support from managers, earnings, job security and other factors. <br></p> <p>Its <a href=\"http://www.oecd.org/statistics/BLI%202014%20UK%20country%20report.pdf\">How\u2019s Life report on the UK </a>noted that in 2010, <strong>18% of British workers reported being in a poor working environment</strong>, a share slightly below the average in European countries.

But there are plenty of reasons why many households are still finding things tough six years after the crisis kicked off. Real wages are falling, household incomes have dipped and GDP per person is still some way off its pre-downturn peak. Expect the official happiness report in December to paint a mixed picture.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Unions reacted with anger on Tuesday after Lloyds Banking Group revealed plans to axe 9,000 jobs and close 200 branches as it \u201cdigitises\u201d its business. The 24%-taxpayer owned bank announced its latest round of job cuts \u2013 which come on top of 45,000 posts already lost since the rescue of HBOS in 2008 \u2013 as it stunned the City by taking a further \u00a3900m provision for misselling payment protection insurance. The latest money set aside takes its total bill so far to more than \u00a311bn and the bank admitted it could take a further \u00a3600m charge in the fourth quarter if complaints remain at their current level. Outlining a new three-year strategy for the bank, chief executive Ant\u00f3nio Horta-Os\u00f3rio said: \u201cThis is a highly competitive market and customers\u2019 behaviour is changing. Increasingly our customers want to access our services in many different ways, via branches, via digital or via mobile.\u201d \u201cRegrettably\u201d, he said, this would require 9,000 job cuts from the 85,000-strong workforce as the business was \u201cdigitised\u201d and also involve revoking its three-year commitment not to shut branches where it was the \u201clast bank in town\u201d. The move is intended to save \u00a31bn by 2017, the period over which the job cuts are expected to take place. Business secretary Vince Cable is to urge banks to come up with a new commitment to avoid towns losing their last branch \u2013 a pledge that 81%-taxpayer-owned bank Royal Bank of Scotland broke in April. \u201cI am suggesting that banks and the post office work more closely together to ensure a long term solution to financial access can be found using existing networks, in a sustainable way,\u201d Cable said. Lord Blackwell, the Lloyds chairman, said the digital transformation came against a backdrop of \u201ca pace of change across the UK financial services sector that is unprecedented, with more fundamental change happening over the next 10 years than has happened over the last 200 years\u201d. But officials at Unite responded angrily. \u201cThe wallets of top executives at Lloyds should not be getting fat by forcing low-paid workers on to the dole. If there are compulsory redundancies or customer service suffers then executive pay should be cut,\u201d said Unite national officer Rob MacGregor, who said the union would be pressing for no compulsory redundancies. The bank said 1,000 redundancies out of 15,000 in the last three years had been compulsory. Ged Nichols, general secretary of the Accord union, said: \u201cThe union is concerned that customer service standards and employee morale will suffer if all operations are not properly resourced. In particular, staff in smaller branches are concerned about the possible security implications of any further reductions in staff numbers.\u201d The 200 branch closures \u2013 6% of its network \u2013 will largely affect its Lloyds and Bank of Scotland fascias and not Halifax branches. More Halifax branches could open and the bank said 50 more could be opened in total, meaning 150 from the group would be shut at the end of the three years. Jobs will not just be lost from branches. The new hit for PPI mis-selling kept Lloyds\u2019 profits flat at \u00a31.6bn for the first nine months of the year despite a 59% fall in the charge for bad debts, which have been one of the biggest impediments to profits since the bailout. The City is awaiting news of the bank\u2019s ability to start paying dividends for the first time since the 2008 crisis. There have been concerns over Lloyds\u2019 ability to resume payments to shareholders, particularly as it emerged as the weakest of the UK banks in the latest stress tests on the banking industry announced on Sunday. George Culmer, the finance director, said the bank still hoped to be able to pay a dividend for the financial year 2014 after discussions with the Bank of England. Threadneedle Street will publish the outcome of its own stress tests on 16 December and Culmer indicated that he expected Lloyds to pass. Even so, the bank\u2019s shares fell 2.4% to 73.5p, just below the 73.6p average price at which taxpayers ploughed \u00a320bn into the bank in 2008. The government has reduced its stake in Lloyds from 43% but has signalled that no more shares will be sold before the election in May. Horta-Os\u00f3rio, whose bonus is linked to the share price, said the bank had become \u201ca safe, highly efficient, UK-focused retail and commercial bank\u201d. He took the helm in March 2011 after being hired from the UK arm of Santander and said he intended to stay to see through his new three-year plan. \u201cI\u2019m already thinking about the next strategy after that,\u201d he said.",

The bank said 1,000 redundancies out of 15,000 in the last three years had been compulsory.</p> <p>Ged Nichols, general secretary of the Accord union, said: \u201cThe union is concerned that customer service standards and employee morale will suffer if all operations are not properly resourced. In particular, staff in smaller branches are concerned about the possible security implications of any further reductions in staff numbers.\u201d</p> <p>The 200 branch closures \u2013 6% of its network \u2013 will largely affect its Lloyds and Bank of Scotland fascias and not Halifax branches. More Halifax branches could open and the bank said 50 more could be opened in total, meaning 150 from the group would be shut at the end of the three years. Jobs will not just be lost from branches.</p> <p>The new hit for PPI mis-selling kept Lloyds\u2019 profits flat at \u00a31.6bn for the first nine months of the year despite a 59% fall in the charge for bad debts, which have been one of the biggest impediments to profits since the bailout.</p> <p>The City is awaiting news of the bank\u2019s ability to start paying dividends for the first time since the 2008 crisis. There have been concerns over Lloyds\u2019 ability to resume payments to shareholders, particularly as it emerged as<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/oct/26/bank-health-check-lloyds-bank-job-losses\"> the weakest of the UK banks in the latest stress tests on the banking industry announced on Sunday</a>.</p> <p>George Culmer, the finance director, said the bank still hoped to be able to pay a dividend for the financial year 2014 after discussions with the Bank of England. Threadneedle Street will publish the outcome of its own stress tests on 16 December and Culmer indicated that he expected Lloyds to pass.</p> <p>Even so, the bank\u2019s shares fell 2.4% to 73.5p, just below the 73.6p average price at which taxpayers ploughed \u00a320bn into the bank in 2008. The government has reduced its stake in Lloyds from 43% but has signalled that no more shares will be sold before the election in May.</p> <p>Horta-Os\u00f3rio, whose bonus is linked to the share price, said the bank had become \u201ca safe, highly efficient, UK-focused retail and commercial bank\u201d.</p> <p>He took the helm in March 2011 <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2010/nov/03/santander-uk-chief-joins-lloyds-on-50m-pound-pay-packet\">after being hired from the UK arm of Santander</a> and said he intended to stay to see through his new three-year plan. \u201cI\u2019m already thinking about the next strategy after that,\u201d he said.</p>",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The Bank of England has warned of \u201cdeep-rooted problems\u201d in the City that are undermining public trust in the financial system, as it launched a sweeping review intended to wipe out market manipulation. In her first speech as deputy governor of the Bank of England, Nemat \u201cMinouche\u201d Shafik said the behaviour of traders in foreign exchange, currencies and bonds markets pointed to a pattern of behaviour that goes beyond a few rogue players. Saying she had found the behaviour of Libor riggers outrageous, Shafik said that the ongoing fines for misconduct were \u201clike salt rubbed into the wounds to public confidence in financial markets\u201d. About \u00a34bn of fines have already been levied for manipulation of key benchmark rates such as Libor and the City is braced for fines for rigging the currency markets to be announced next month. \u201cPublic outrage is based on the fact that rewards in finance are disproportionate and the system is rigged. When people read of malpractice in financial markets, of trading profits being claimed through manipulation, collusion or dishonesty, they naturally wonder if they are one of the people who have been wronged,\u201d said Shafik. She was speaking at the London School of Economics as she launched a much-anticipated consultation into the markets for fixed income, foreign exchange and commodities, which are collectively known as FICC and generated $117bn (\u00a372bn) of revenues for the big investment banks in 2013. These are global markets and any cleanup efforts would need international cooperation. George Osborne commissioned the review in his Mansion House speech in June and it is due to report next June, after the general election. \u201cThe integrity of the City matters to the economy of Britain. Markets here set the interest rates for people\u2019s mortgages, the exchange rates for our exports and holidays, and the commodity prices for the goods we buy,\u201d the chancellor said on Monday. Shafik said these markets affected everyone\u2019s lives. They are huge, she said, describing how the global stock of bonds was worth about $100tn (\u00a362tn) in 2013 \u2013 bigger than world GDP. \u201cThe initial argument that it is just the case of a \u2018few bad apples\u2019 is not longer credible. Instead it seems that there were deep-rooted problems in the nature of the FICC markets that resulted in practices that would be unacceptable elsewhere,\u201d said Shafik. She said that changes already in train should help to address behaviour. She added: \u201cBut we need to make sure that taken together they add up to a comprehensive solution to fix the barrel and to get rid of the bad apples.\u201d The consultation paper could signal a sweeping review of the way the markets operate, from looking at competition between the big players to the way trades are handled by market makers and to the penalties that could be faced. It also left open the door for an industry-brokered solution to the problem rather than more regulation imposed from the outside. \u201cThe review ... wants to consider whether more needs to be done to monitor for \u2013 and where it is found punish \u2013 misconduct,\u201d she said. Libor rigging has already become a criminal offence and the chancellor said last month that seven other offences, including manipulating gold and currency markets, would become criminal offences by the end of the year. The review being led by Shafik asks whether there need to be stronger whistleblowing arrangements, tougher electronic surveillance and punishing of staff through penalties that could be made public. She said that the ease with which traders change jobs demonstrated that they felt \u201cgreater loyalty to their desks or peers in the market than to their firm\u201d. \u201cIt is clear that in the runup to the financial crisis some firms active in FICC markets allowed the culture on their trading floors to get out of control, combining weak controls with incentives focused heavily on short-term revenue performance,\u201d she said. The review raises the prospect of forcing firms to check references of new hires for five years and requiring hedge funds, fund managers and stockbrokers to behave like banks and claw back bonuses when things go wrong. There is also the possibility that firms facing conduct issues might be forced to hold more capital or have business withheld from them by other players. Her remarks are the latest warning to the industry by a deputy governor of the Bank, after Sir Jon Cunliffesaid last week that bankers, particularly those who worked in FICC, should brace for a pay cut.",
