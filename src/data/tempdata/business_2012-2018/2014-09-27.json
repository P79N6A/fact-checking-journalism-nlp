      "bodyText": "'Tesco is like a wounded animal: we never know what it is going to do next,\" is how one battered food supplier describes its relationship with the UK's biggest retailer. The company dreads hearing from the supermarket, as its emails and letters usually contain bad tidings: invoices showing de facto deductions, demands for cash or years-old supposedly unpaid bills unearthed by its auditing teams. Like houses, with supermarkets it's all about location, location, location. Each year food and drinks companies pay billions of pounds to secure the most prominent shelf space and promotions for their products. It's the oil that greases the wheels of the \u00a3175bn UK grocery market and \u2013 until last week \u2013 it pretty much went on under the radar. But on Monday, Tesco's new boss Dave Lewis was forced to tell the City that its profits for the first six months of the year would be some \u00a3250m lower than the \u00a31.1bn previously indicated. The hole was blamed on \"accelerated recognition of commercial income\" \u2013 industry jargon that describes the various payments it receives for promotions, but also the substantial bonuses or \"rebates\" they collect when jointly agreed sales targets are hit. The shortfall points to executives having been too optimistic in their estimate of the amount of revenue actually earned during this period while being less enthusiastic about taking some other running costs into account. While these opaque payment structures are said to suit multinational suppliers such as Nestl\u00e9 and Procter &amp; Gamble, which need to be able to justify price differences between their major customers, the labyrinthine regime often leaves smaller suppliers feeling short-changed. \"Retailers have different approaches [to commercial income] but Tesco has lost its moral compass,\" continues the supplier. \"Across the industry you pretty much get what you pay for. Tesco is different. If there is a \u00a350,000 fee for running a promotion it is automatically deducted: and if you don't get your money's worth the chances of getting your money back is basically zero.\" A recent survey of the experiences of more than 500 suppliers in their dealings with all the big supermarkets reveals a depressing shopping list of methods being used to wring extra money out of them at a time when they are under pressure from fast-growing discounters Aldi and Lidl. The list includes disputing or delaying payment of invoices for more than 120 days; cutting a product's price and then demanding compensation to maintain the profit margin; and demanding upfront payments in exchange for hitting sales targets that do not materialise. \"The worst thing is creating new high charges and then emailing our account manager and taking the money without prior agreement from our account,\" reveals one anonymous supplier in a survey commissioned by industry watchdog the Groceries Code Adjudicator. \"I believe this is being used to fill gaps in their sales performance.\" Lewis, acting on a whistleblower's tip-off, has launched a investigation into what he says is a \"serious issue\". The company has drafted in a team of external accountants and lawyers to comb through the books. In the meantime, four senior executives \u2013 including Chris Bush, who runs the domestic supermarket chain \u2013 have been suspended. That Lewis is not entirely happy with Tesco's \"Every Little Helps\" slogan \u2013 which seems to apply to suppliers as well as customers \u2013 was apparent in the email he sent to staff on Friday, informing them \"a change in our culture as well as our processes\" was required. \"We want to work in a business which is open, transparent, fair and honest,\" he wrote. \"We all expect Tesco to act with integrity and transparency at all times.\" How Tesco manages its dealings with suppliers should come as no real surprise to Lewis, given he has spent much of the last three decades at Unilever, purveyor of toiletries-aisle staples such as Dove shampoo and Lynx deodorant. At the half-year stage, Tesco's finance team has to guesstimate how much money it has earned from suppliers, sums complicated by rebates linked to full-year sales. The question everyone is asking is whether top managers deliberately banked supplier payments ahead of time to flatter the company's financial position in the six months to 23 August. The way Tesco bills suppliers means there is \"quite a lot of leeway\" to move money around, says another industry source. \"There is a clear date on the invoice but the period it covers is really unclear.\" The alternative scenario is that a lack of leadership both at a board level and in the finance team \u2013 the resignation of Laurie McIlwee left it without a full-time finance chief for much of the period \u2013 meant Tesco had lost its grip on its finances, leading to accounting errors. Shareholders have started to jab their fingers at chairman Sir Richard Broadbent, who allowed the board to be purged of experienced executives during Philip Clarke's reign as chief executive. \"The chairman has been the leader of this organisation that seems to have failed at every turn,\" was the assessment of David Herro, chief executive of US fund manager Harris Associates, which is a major Tesco shareholder. A large Tesco supplier, who knows the suspended executives well, says the company's approach to commercial income had not appear to have become more aggressive in recent months. \"I don't think anything had materially changed,\" he says. \"What's strange about the period under scrutiny is they reported a massive profit warning and I know the trading team were encouraged to clear the decks to give the new chief executive some headroom, so they were being prudent and conservative in their guidance. \"I suspect there has been a monumental failure of governance,\" he concludes.",

      "bodyText": "As this page never tires of pointing out, just over a year before Justin King retired as Sainsbury's boss, he was pledging himself to the grocer for the \"long term\" \u2013 before U-turning more sharply than a supermarket trolley. \"I don't believe today, or six months' time when I depart, will represent the top for Sainsbury's,\" he smoothed as he announced his abdication. \"It will go on to further heights.\" By an astonishing coincidence, 36 unbroken quarters of growth then came to a crashing halt just as King was handing over to old pal Mike Coupe. Things have since got worse. \"After sustainably outperforming the market and the big four peer group through the recession, Sainsbury has witnessed a material reverse in absolute and relative trading momentum in 2014,\" observes Shore Capital's Darren Shirley. \"We find the change in fortune to be perplexing and worrying for Sainsbury's investors, with the group losing market share in recent months, judging by Kantar data.\" All of which will be discussed this week at the grocer's trading statement, when investors will want to know if Coupe has made mistakes, or if his friend omitted to mention a few points as he rushed out the door. Still, as last week showed, King would not be the first great leader to forget to deliver a crucial economic message \u2013 now known as doing an Ed Miliband. Saga switch sticks in memory Very few companies have such an impact on their customers that they are seen as a representation of a certain group of society. But the Saga Generation \u2013 a phrase used by hacks as a synonym for the over-50s \u2013 is one such example, seeing as it is derived from the company that specialises in selling holidays and insurance products to older people. The company is now listed on the stock exchange, having floated in May at 185p a share, and we get to hear about how it has been getting on this week when it releases maiden interim results. Already, the shares have seen better days, having slipped 6% \u2013 suggesting a slight annoyance from the listing has yet to fade from the memory. At the time, Saga irritated investors by arranging to be listed as a general retailer, rather than plump for the harder fight of being categorised as an insurer \u2013 a sector which accounts for the vast majority of the company's profits but where the investment comparisons are tougher. The City is still irked by this move, which it sees as little more than an expedient identity switch. A Saga regeneration, more like. Houses with contradictory views If you thought the debate about UK house prices just drones on at bourgeois supper parties in pockets of London, then think again. The argument is also conducted in a slightly less intoxicated setting each month by housing economists. Last week we were told how (a) house price growth has stalled for the first time in more than 18 months as increasing numbers of would-be buyers worry about a property price bubble and a looming rise in interest rates (Hometrack); and (b) annual house price growth accelerated to 8.4% in England and Wales in August \u2013 the highest rate of increase for nearly seven years (Land Registry). These reports do measure slightly different things, of course, which is very handy as everyone can find the answer they are looking for. So, there is either a \"chill in the air\" (Richard O'Donnell of Hometrack) or the market has moved \"from wobble to warp drive\" (James Hall from London estate agent Fishneedwater). Don't warm to either interpretation? No matter. Nationwide will announce its own monthly house price survey this week, which just goes to show: there is always another unique opportunity to buy an argument about the UK property market \u2013 as an estate agent might put it.",
