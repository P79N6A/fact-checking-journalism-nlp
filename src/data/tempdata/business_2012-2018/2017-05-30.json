      "bodyText": "Malcolm Turnbull will use a speech to an economic thinktank on Wednesday to argue that increasing the top personal tax rate to 49.5% is a penalty on success and to insist that his government\u2019s budget stuck to Liberal values. The prime minister will use a speech to the Committee for the Economic Development of Australia on Wednesday morning to argue that governments cannot \u201creduce inequality of opportunity by putting up barriers that stop people getting ahead\u201d. Turnbull will blast Labor policies, which include increasing the Medicare levy for workers in the top two tax brackets, and keeping the current 2% deficit levy on earnings above $180,000 \u2013 which would put the top tax rate at 49.5%. He will say the last time the top tax rate plus the Medicare levy was higher than Labor\u2019s current proposal was back in 1988-89, when it was 50.25%. Turnbull will argue that a tax rate at that level undermines \u201caspiration and fairness, while worsening incentives and economic efficiency\u201d. \u201cReturning to that bygone era would send a very poor signal to all Australian workers: don\u2019t bother trying to earn just over two times average full-time weekly earnings,\u201d Turnbull will say. \u201cBecause once you do, half of every additional bit of effort; half of every extra hour you work; half of every new idea you generate \u2013 indeed, half of your extra perseverance, determination and enterprise \u2013 belongs to the government.\u201d In a speech designed to contrast his government\u2019s aspirational philosophy with Labor\u2019s current inclination toward redistribution, the prime minister will argue that if Australians recognise the principle that we are all born equal \u201cthen surely it follows that everyone deserves an equal chance of improving their stocks in life\u201d. \u201cOne of the marks of an advanced society and a developed, well-functioning economy, is that each generation strives to improve on the last, and has a good chance of doing so. \u201cLiberals not only believe in this ideal, we believe that it is the government\u2019s duty to help enable it. \u201cYou cannot reduce inequality of opportunity by putting up barriers that stop people getting ahead. Rather, these barriers entrench the wealth or poverty that people are born into. \u201cWhat more hopeless, defeatist principle could there be than the one that tells people they cannot aspire to outdo their parents? And what is more natural, more human, than do all we can as parents to ensure that they can?\u201d With opinion polls suggesting that the Turnbull government has not achieved a political dividend from a budget that attempted to reset the national debate, and shift the Coalition back towards the political centre, the prime minister will also use his speech to defend the direction of his government\u2019s economic statement. The high-taxing, high-spending May budget was characterised by many commentators as \u201cLabor-lite\u201d. Turnbull will acknowledge that Liberals prefer lower taxes \u201cbut we dislike unsustainable deficits and mounting debt even more\u201d. He will say the government embarked on budget repair \u201cwhile sticking to our values\u201d. \u201cAll of our new spending decisions were paid for by reducing spending elsewhere in the budget.\u201d With pitched political battles still in progress over key budget initiatives, Turnbull will argue that his government is funding schools, Medicare and the national disability insurance scheme in a sustainable manner. \u201cLabor floats grand schemes, Liberals fund vital services.\u201d \u201cThis is the great modern test of political character, and it is one that Labor has failed,\u201d Turnbull will say. \u201cOnly Liberal governments are able to deliver the services and quality of life that Australians have come to expect, and we won\u2019t make future generations pay for it.\u201d",

    "webTitle": "Passengers still without bags after British Airways IT meltdown", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "British Airways is still struggling to return baggage to passengers as it attempts to salvage its battered reputation and investigate the cause of a computer system outage that left 75,000 people stranded at the weekend. Cancelled holidays and chaotic scenes at Heathrow and Gatwick airports over the bank holiday weekend have been followed by reports of passengers\u2019 baggage being forwarded to destinations abroad while its owners were unable to travel. The airline said it hoped most of a backlog of tens of thousands of bags would be delivered by the end of Wednesday. It also pledged to compensate all passengers, with the bill expected to reach more than \u00a3100m. About \u00a3500m was wiped off the market value of BA\u2019s owner, IAG, in early trading in London on Tuesday, although shares later recovered to 1.4% \u2013 cutting the value of the airline group by \u00a3170m. BA said it was still investigating a power issue that it says caused the check-in and operating systems to crash, and left the airline struggling to locate and contact even its own staff. A spokeswoman for the airline insisted that the failure was \u201ccategorically nothing to do\u201d with outsourcing. However, the initial explanation for the computer chaos provided by BA\u2019s chief executive, Alex Cruz, provoked further confusion. Cruz had blamed a power surge for knocking out the system but IT specialists queried whether a power surge could cause such failure, while local electricity providers said they had no evidence that a surge had taken place. SSE said its network was operating as normal in the Harmondsworth area \u2013 the location of BA\u2019s headquarters \u2013 on Saturday morning. James Wilman, chief executive of the data centre consultancy Future-tech, said: \u201cIt\u2019s either bad design or there\u2019s more to the story than just a power surge. You have something specifically that you build in to a data centre called surge protection, which is there to protect against exactly this [sort of] incident.\u201d BA insisted that the computer system outages that grounded hundreds of flights were not linked to ferocious cost-cutting and the outsourcing of work to contractors in its IT department. About 200 IT staff at BA are being made redundant. But Mick Rix of the GMB union said a contractor was likely to be responsible: \u201cTheir procurement department is looking into it \u2013 which suggests they know exactly what the cause was and who is to blame.\u201d It emerged that Theresa May, as home secretary, was warned on several occasions last year of potential risks linked to outsourcing operations to India. The GMB union wrote to May on four occasions to highlight a potential security risk, warning that potentially sensitive data could be handled offshore and that low-paid IT workers from Tata Consulting Services were being brought in on temporary work visas to replace BA staff. Asked about the airport chaos at an election campaign press conference in Wolverhampton, May said: \u201cThe IT crisis that hit British Airways is predominantly a matter for British Airways.\u201d She added: \u201cIt\u2019s up to them to sort their IT out and to ensure that they are able to provide the services that people expect them to provide as British Airways.\u201d The global head of IT for IAG, Bill Francis, has been attempting to find savings of about \u20ac90m (\u00a378m) per year from outsourcing. Francis, with no previous IT experience, was previously in charge of introducing new contracts and working practices to cabin crew at BA during the bitter industrial dispute of 2010-11. IAG\u2019s chief executive, Willie Walsh, has so far made no public comments on the incident. BA said its systems were now fully restored and that it was back to running a full flight schedule on Tuesday. The airline said it would meet reasonable compensation claims, and that passengers who had booked their own travel would be considered on a case-by-case basis. Customers said they had been told tens of thousands of bags were being kept in warehouses at Heathrow. Ola Holmstrom, 44, from London, whose family bank holiday break to see relatives in Sweden was aborted, said he had still not been reunited with his luggage, which had been sent to Stockholm. It included prescription medicine and his wife\u2019s glasses. Holmstrom had returned to Heathrow twice after being unable to contact BA online or by phone. He said he was a frequent flyer, adding: \u201cWe\u2019ve chosen to be loyal to BA, but you question your loyalty at times like these.\u201d Competitors have already profited from the incident, with Ryanair reporting a surge in last-minute bookings. The airline said it had reviewed its own systems after this weekend, but had never had a major outage. It added that it had backup systems in three different locations around Europe and undertook regular disaster recovery testing. Contrasting the airline\u2019s operation to BA\u2019s outsourced IT, Ryanair\u2019s chief commercial officer, David O\u2019Brien, said: \u201cAll of our investment in IT is in-house, in Europe \u2013 Dublin, Madrid and Rostov \u2013 proximate to our business, and expensive. We invest our money where it needs to be.\u201d",

Haji-Ioannou said he had signed up to the Giving Pledge, an organisation founded by Gates and fellow billionaire Warren Buffett, which asks the world\u2019s wealthiest people to give away the majority of their money. The Cypriot-born magnate, who has stamped his orange-hued \u201ceasy\u201d brand on everything from aeroplanes to cut-price convenience stores, was estimated to be worth \u00a31.95bn in the latest Sunday Times rich list. He is expected to give away about \u00a31bn of that, some of it in cash during his lifetime and the remainder by selling assets through the terms of his will. Haji-Ioannou joins a host of billionaires who have made the pledge, whose British contingent includes the Virgin Group founder, Sir Richard Branson, Ann Gloag, the transport group Stagecoach\u2019s co-founder, and Lord Sainsbury, whose family started the supermarket chain. In a letter accompanying his pledge, Haji-Ioannou said: \u201cAllow me to start by saying that I am not sure I am a worthy member of this group of extraordinary individuals. I consider that I have been lucky in life at least twice,\u201d he said. \u201cI inherited some wealth from my father, a self-made Greek-Cypriot shipping magnate, and then I was lucky enough to have been at the right place at the right time to start a business that did much better than I ever could have hoped.\u201d Haji-Ioannou was 28 years old when he founded easyJet in 1995, leasing two Boeing 737-200 aircraft in a bid to create a low-cost rival to traditional flag-carrier airlines such as British Airways. The business has since grown to become the second-largest carrier in Europe behind Ryanair in passenger numbers. He is no longer involved in the day-to-day running of the business, but a large portion of his wealth is made up of a 34% stake in easyJet that he shares with family members, which is worth about \u00a31.9bn. Haji-Ioannou said the no-frills airline was \u201cnothing special\u201d in comparison with the business empires of some of the Giving Pledge\u2019s other members, who include the Facebook co-founder Mark Zuckerberg and Elon Musk, the futurist and chief executive of electric car firm Tesla. Haji-Ioannou, who turned 50 this year, said he would channel his wealth through his philanthropic foundation, which funds projects in places where he has lived and worked. These include scholarships to the London School of Economics and City University and annual donations to the Red Cross and World Wildlife Fund. Other charitable projects include food donations in Greece and projects to reconcile differences between Greek-Cypriots and Turkish-Cypriots in the country of his birth. He also funds unspecified projects in the tax haven of Monaco, where he lives. \u201cI guess my belief is that nobody has a monopoly on good charitable ideas and the problems in our world will never all go away,\u201d he said. \u201cSo we have to keep helping, within our means, forever.\u201d He added that he had been \u201cinspired\u201d by a phone call from Gates, the world\u2019s richest man with an estimated fortune of $88.5bn (\u00a369bn). While Haji-Ioannou became one of Britain\u2019s wealthiest people thanks to easyJet, some of his other \u201ceasy\u201d ventures have proved more difficult. While easyCar and easyHotel are still going, he enjoyed less success applying the brand to other ventures such as easyCinema, easy4Men, easyMoney, easyInternetCafe, easyMusic, easyPizza and easyCruise. Last year, he applied the name to easyFoodstore, a budget convenience store on London\u2019s busy North Circular road, where everything was initially priced at 25p.",

      "bodyText": "Brussels is preparing to crack down on accountants and lawyers running tax-avoidance schemes in response to the Panama Papers scandal that showed how the rich and powerful hide their money. Jean-Claude Juncker, the European commission president, told MEPs on Tuesday that he would table a draft law before the end of June that aims to shed light on experts who help clients exploit tax laws and shift money to offshore tax havens. Lawyers, accountants and other financial experts who devise complex tax avoidance schemes were a \u201creal problem\u201d, Juncker said, adding: \u201cYou can\u2019t simply hide behind lawyers\u2019 confidentiality. We are working on that. There is progress being made.\u201d The draft proposal would have to be approved by EU members and is not expected to come into force until January 2019 \u2013 weeks before the UK quits the bloc. \u201cThe trust of our citizens has been seriously shaken by the revelations and there is a lot of indignation levelled at the corporate tax system, which is seen as unfair and insufficient,\u201d Juncker told MEPs. More than halfway through his five-year term as commission chief, Juncker is seen as the poacher-turned-gamekeeper of tax avoidance. Days after taking up his EU post in November 2014, he was hit by revelations that Luxembourg \u2013 the country he ran for nearly 20 years \u2013 had been allowing tax avoidance schemes on a massive scale. Juncker served as Luxembourg\u2019s prime minister and finance minister from 1995 until 2013, a period when the country helped water down EU efforts to tackle banking secrecy, according to documents from the time. During Tuesday\u2019s 90-minute meeting with MEPs, he was asked to explain his role in weakening EU tax laws agreed in long-ago ministerial meetings. But even his sternest critics believe Juncker has changed. \u201cYou have turned from Saul to Paul on the road to Damascus,\u201d said Sven Giegold, a German Green MEP. \u201cBut citizens want to have a clear statement of responsibility about what you did in the past. That is what is damaging your credibility and I think that it is a shame because you are making very positive progress.\u201d Juncker batted away suggestions he had something to apologise for. He said: \u201cI was a minister at the time, I wasn\u2019t responsible for financial and business issues, so I never discussed fiscal measures with a company. It is a clear principle in Luxembourg.\u201d He also rejected suggestions of a Damascene conversion, although he acknowledged the system had been unfair. \u201cI believed in tax competition, which is a principle of the [EU] treaty and I still believe in tax competition, but I am focusing my attention now more on fair tax competition,\u201d he said. \u201cIt has to be fair and it was not always fair.\u201d Juncker, who once joked that bank robbers could make the best police officers, has presided over a multi-pronged attack on tax avoidance since arriving in Brussels. Large multinational companies will have to disclose more information about taxes and profits, although precise details are still being hammered out. The commission has investigated state-supported tax avoidance, looking into low taxes paid by McDonald\u2019s in Luxembourg and Apple in Ireland. At the end of the year, the EU will publish a blacklist of tax havens in an attempt to name and shame countries to fall into line with international tax standards. The British government has not spelled out which EU tax laws it will keep, if any, after Brexit but has floated the idea of abandoning a European-style social model. Under the coalition government, the UK signed up to several international initiatives against tax avoidance. Officials in Brussels argue the EU regime is more rigorous because it relies less on voluntary standards.",

    "webTitle": "British Airways should come clean about computer chaos", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "British Airways, with the insouciance the airline so frequently displays, is still to say precisely why its systems failed so catastrophically at the weekend. So let us offer a few pointers. On 18 July last year, delays of up to four hours greeted BA passengers at Heathrow and Gatwick. What caused the chaos? \u201cA short-lived problem with our check-in system,\u201d said BA. Three months later, on 6 September, lengthy queues built up again with passengers given boarding passes and even luggage labels written out by hand. The second check-in failure in the space of 12 weeks was blamed on \u201coperational reasons\u201d, with pilots reportedly telling weary passengers it was a \u201ccomputer glitch\u201d. So when Heathrow Terminal 5 descended into mayhem over the weekend, BA boss Alex Cruz could not have been unaware of the airline\u2019s earlier IT problems. Yet he saw no reason to resign, instead offering \u201cprofuse\u201d apologies. In a carefully scripted official BA video message amid multiple flight cancellations, Cruz blamed \u201cpower supply issues\u201d as the \u201croot cause\u201d of the problem. In other interviews he talked of a problematic \u201cpower surge\u201d. This immediately provoked widespread guffaws from IT experts, for whom uninterruptible power supplies, back-up centres and \u201cmirror\u201d sites are the bread-and-butter basics of any major IT project. The power companies added to the puzzle, pointing out that electricity supply in the Harmondsworth area where BA\u2019s head office is sited had been running perfectly normally. The lack of clarity over the IT failure will come as no surprise to many customers of Vueling, the Spanish airline that is a subsidiary of BA\u2019s parent company, IAG, and where Cruz was in charge before shifting to BA. In early July last year, thousands of customers endured four days of chaos at Barcelona-El Prat as Vueling cancelled scores of flights. This episode was also characterised by a near information blackout by the airline, prompting the Catalan authorities to drag in the company\u2019s president to obtain some sort of explanation. The House of Commons transport select committee should follow their lead. The ambiguity around the weekend\u2019s IT meltdown extends to compensation. In his video message, Cruz told travellers they would be offered full refunds. But he made no mention of EU 261, the rule that gives passengers monetary compensation of up to \u20ac600 for delays over three hours, or cancellations. It remains unclear how much passengers will be compensated for consequential losses \u2013 such as taking it upon themselves to book an alternative flight, usually at great cost, to reach their destination. The rules are unclear here; an airline \u201cmay\u201d have to pay up, but will treat it case by case. The experience of many passengers who have written to the Guardian\u2019s consumer champion\u2019s column tell us claims are often protracted and frequently unsuccessful. Too often promises made by staff on the ground (\u201cjust book yourself on to another flight and we\u2019ll pay\u201d) are later rejected by management. Our consumer champs say that if airline counter staff make you a promise, video it on your phone \u2013 it may be your only chance of enforcing a claim. Many expected BA\u2019s main punishment to come from the stock market. But as the London market reopened after the bank holiday, IAG\u2019s shares hit mild turbulence, rather than nose-diving. By the end of the day they were down just 8.5p to 605p and were not even among the worst 10 FTSE-100 performers of the day. The IT meltdown has barely dented the airline group\u2019s stellar market performance over the past year. IAG\u2019s shares are up 60% since last summer and they are trading at four times their 2012 level. Most estimates put BA\u2019s likely compensation bill at about \u00a3100m. That\u2019s little more than 0.5% of revenues. The stock market is evidently betting that the skies will clear again for the airline. But given the scenes of chaos at the weekend \u2013 where one passenger described Heathrow as \u201cthe angriest place I\u2019ve been\u201d, the market\u2019s optimism may be misplaced. Meanwhile serendipity treated us to Ryanair\u2019s results on the very day BA was mopping up its shattered schedules. Michael O\u2019Leary yet again cut prices, cut costs and raised profits. In 2013 he changed Ryanair\u2019s famously abrasive customer service culture. And he never outsourced the company\u2019s IT. BA needs customers to think flying the flag still offers something special. But the bank holiday weekend\u2019s flights chaos suggests that currently IAG boss Willie Walsh could learn a lot from his deadly Irish rival.",

      "body": "<p>British Airways, with the insouciance the airline so frequently displays, is still to say precisely why its systems failed so catastrophically at the weekend. So let us offer a few pointers. </p> <p>On 18 July last year, delays of up to four hours greeted BA passengers at Heathrow and Gatwick. What caused the chaos? <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-36825601\">\u201cA short-lived problem with our check-in system,\u201d </a>said BA. Three months later, on 6 September, lengthy queues built up again with passengers given boarding passes and even luggage labels written out by hand. The second check-in failure in the space of 12 weeks was blamed on \u201coperational reasons\u201d, with pilots reportedly telling weary passengers it was a \u201ccomputer glitch\u201d.</p> <p>So when Heathrow Terminal 5 descended into mayhem over the weekend, BA boss Alex Cruz could not have been unaware of the airline\u2019s earlier IT problems. Yet he saw no reason to resign, instead offering \u201cprofuse\u201d apologies. In a carefully scripted official BA video message amid multiple flight cancellations, Cruz blamed \u201cpower supply issues\u201d as the \u201croot cause\u201d of the problem. In other interviews he talked of a problematic \u201cpower surge\u201d. This immediately provoked widespread guffaws from IT experts, for whom uninterruptible power supplies, back-up centres and \u201cmirror\u201d sites are the bread-and-butter basics of any major IT project. The power companies added to the puzzle, pointing out that electricity supply in the Harmondsworth area where BA\u2019s head office is sited had been running perfectly normally.</p> <p>The lack of clarity over the IT failure will come as no surprise to many customers of Vueling, the Spanish airline that is a subsidiary of BA\u2019s parent company, IAG, and where Cruz was in charge before shifting to BA. In early July last year, thousands of customers endured <a href=\"http://elpais.com/elpais/2016/07/04/inenglish/1467622396_910185.html\">four days of chaos at Barcelona-El Prat</a> as Vueling cancelled scores of flights. This episode was also characterised by a near information blackout by the airline, prompting the Catalan authorities to drag in the company\u2019s president to obtain some sort of explanation. The House of Commons transport select committee should follow their lead. </p> <p>The ambiguity around the weekend\u2019s IT meltdown extends to compensation. In his video message, Cruz told travellers they would be offered full refunds. But he made no mention of<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/may/28/british-airways-stranded-heathrow-gatwick-compensation\"> EU 261</a>, the rule that gives passengers monetary compensation of up to \u20ac600 for delays over three hours, or cancellations.</p> <p>It remains unclear how much passengers will be compensated for consequential losses \u2013 such as taking it upon themselves to book an alternative flight, usually at great cost, to reach their destination. The rules are unclear here; an airline \u201cmay\u201d have to pay up, but will treat it case by case.</p> <p> The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/series/bachelor-and-brignall-consumer-champions+business/britishairways\">experience of many passengers</a> who have written to the Guardian\u2019s consumer champion\u2019s column tell us claims are often protracted and frequently unsuccessful. Too often promises made by staff on the ground (\u201cjust book yourself on to another flight and we\u2019ll pay\u201d) are later rejected by management. Our consumer champs say that if airline counter staff make you a promise, video it on your phone \u2013 it may be your only chance of enforcing a claim. <br></p> <p>Many expected BA\u2019s main punishment to come from the stock market. But as the London market reopened after the bank holiday, IAG\u2019s shares hit mild turbulence, rather than nose-diving. By the end of the day they were down just 8.5p to 605p and were not even among the worst 10 FTSE-100 performers of the day. The IT meltdown has barely dented the airline group\u2019s stellar market performance over the past year. IAG\u2019s shares are up 60% since last summer and they are trading at four times their 2012 level. </p> <p>Most estimates put BA\u2019s likely compensation bill at about \u00a3100m. That\u2019s little more than 0.5% of revenues. The stock market is evidently betting that the skies will clear again for the airline. But given the scenes of chaos at the weekend \u2013 where one passenger described Heathrow as \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/may/29/ba-computer-meltdown-heathrow-was-the-angriest-place-ive-ever-been\">the angriest place I\u2019ve been\u201d,</a> the market\u2019s optimism may be misplaced.</p> <p>Meanwhile serendipity treated us to Ryanair\u2019s results on the very day BA was mopping up its shattered schedules. Michael O\u2019Leary yet again cut prices, cut costs and raised profits. In 2013 he changed Ryanair\u2019s famously abrasive customer service culture. And he never outsourced the company\u2019s IT. </p> <p>BA needs customers to think flying the flag still offers something special. But the bank holiday weekend\u2019s flights chaos suggests that currently IAG boss Willie Walsh could learn a lot from his deadly Irish rival. </p>",

      "bodyText": "Experts have questioned British Airways\u2019 claim that this weekend\u2019s catastrophic IT failure was down to a \u201cpower surge\u201d, as the company\u2019s chief executive has claimed. \u00c1lex Cruz, BA\u2019s chairman and chief executive, said on Monday that the surge was \u201cso strong that it rendered the back-up system ineffective\u201d. But multiple data centre designers have told the Guardian that a power surge should not be able to bring down a data centre, let alone a data centre and its back-up. \u201cIt\u2019s either bad design or there\u2019s more to the story than just a power surge,\u201d said James Wilman, chief executive of the data centre consultancy Future-tech. \u201cYou have something specifically that you build in to a data centre called surge protection, which is there to protect against exactly this incident. You also have an uninterruptible power supply, a UPS, and part of its job is to condition the power\u201d \u2013 ie smooth out the peaks and flows in current. \u201cBetween those and a quality earthing system, you should be protected from power surges,\u201d Wilman said. Andy Hirst, specialist projects director at the data centre builder Sudlows, said it was shocking just how many data centres lacked the resilience to deal with common problems. \u201cA number of failures could have resulted in the downtime. Some organisations invest millions in IT equipment but seem to overlook the infrastructure required to ensure the IT equipment is kept running with no power outages.\u201d According to a report in the Times, SSE and UK Power Networks, the two electricity companies that provide energy to the area in which BA has its data centre, denied there had been a power surge. The real problem, said Matthew Bloch, managing director of Bytemark Hosting, was not what happened when the power went off but what happened when it was turned back on. He asked: \u201cWhen was the last time somebody test-rebooted a crucial database? Or executed a procedure like restoring a server? Was there pressure to say it\u2019ll only take an hour when it\u2019ll really take a day?\u201d Barry Elliott, director of Capitoline consultants, said power surges were easy to protect against but still a regular problem. \u201cWe have had 12 years\u2019 experience in designing and auditing data centres and we\u2019ve seen that after catastrophic IT problems, power problems are the second most common cause of data centre outages.\u201d The airline industry is notorious for running outdated infrastructure long after standards have improved. In December, for instance, it was revealed that passenger booking systems used by multiple airlines were easy prey for hackers. Wilman said the sort of outdated infrastructure that could lead to a data centre being brought down by a power surge was unlikely to be limited to the travel industry. \u201cIf you saw the amount of old infrastructure that this country is hanging off of, you wouldn\u2019t sleep at night,\u201d he said. \u201cWe were leading the communications curve back 20 years ago, and the problem is that that now means that much of our infrastructure is hanging off a 25-year-old backbone. Some data centres are reaching the end of their life. And how do you refurbish that when you can\u2019t turn it off?\u201d",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Europe\u2019s stock markets have closed for the night, with the main indices losing ground. The FTSE 100 and German DAX both fell by around 0.25%, while France\u2019s CAC shed 0.5%. Worries over Greece\u2019s bailout haven\u2019t faded, despite Alexis Tsipras hitting the phones in an attempt to reach a political solution with Angela Merkel and Emmanuel Macron. Bild\u2019s report that Greece might simply decline its next bailout loan, triggering a new debt repayment crisis this summer, has alarmed some traders - even though it has been robustly denied by Athens today. It\u2019s a reminder that Greece\u2019s debt crisis hasn\u2019t gone away, with no sign of a serious debt relief deal. Predictions of an early general election in Italy has also given investors some concerns. Jasper Lawler of London Capital Group explains: Talk that Italy will spice up Europe\u2019s political landscape again with its own snap election is unsettling the idea that Europe is now free of populist risk in 2017. Former Italian Prime Minister Renzi has suggested Italy could hold simultaneous elections with Germany in September. Not to be left out, Greece may opt out of its next bailout if debt relief deal isn\u2019t struck, adding to the potential for market disruption. European assets need the three pillars of stronger economic data, higher political risk in the US and reduced political risk in Europe to outperform. Italy and Greece could are holding the sledgehammer that could knock down one of those three pillars. On Wall Street, the Dow Jones is down 0.2% following the drop in US consumer confidence this month. But Amazon\u2019s burst over the $1,000/share mark has pushed the Nasdaq a little higher. Chris Beauchamp of IG says the tech stock boom has further to run. Momentum traders clearly still think that the likes of Facebook and Amazon can go higher, however, with the Nasdaq 100 having gained almost a fifth so far this year. Amazon has surpassed the $1000 mark this afternoon, an event that would mark the top in the market perfectly, but one that probably won\u2019t. There seems to be no shortage of investors willing to jump on board this bandwagon. After an early wobble, the pound is higher tonight after a new poll gave Theresa May a 12-point lead ahead of next week\u2019s election. Traders are also digesting an interesting research note from JP Morgan, which suggests that a hung parliament could actually be good for sterling. Strategist Paul Meggyesi argued that a centre-left coalition could be welcomed by the City, if it would aim for a softer Brexit. As he put it: In the post-referendum world, all political developments need to be viewed through a Brexit prism and an argument can be made that a hung parliament which delivered or held out the prospect of a softer-Brexit coalition of the left-of-centre parties (Labour/Lib Dems/SNP) might actually be sterling positive.\u201d And on that note, it\u2019s time to wrap up. Thanks for reading and commenting. GW Here\u2019s some reaction to the US consumer confidence report, from Patrick Chovanec, chief Strategist at Silvercrest Asset Management. Just in: US consumer confidence has fallen, raising concerns that the Trump Bump may be fading. The monthly measure of consumer morale, from the Confidence Board, fell to 117.9 from 120.3 in April. The survey found that consumers are less optimistic about future economic prospects, but also a little happier about the current conditions. Analysts at Danske Bank say it\u2019s a sign that confidence may have peaked: But....Michael Pearce of Capital Economics says it\u2019s \u201cnothing to be worried about\u201d. He points out that consumer confidence is still high by historical standards, suggesting the economy is in decent health. The index is still consistent on past form with consumption growth rising to over 4% annualised in the second quarter. Meanwhile, the current conditions index edged up in May, and is close to a 16-year high. The details of the survey highlight that labour market conditions remain exceptionally tight. The balance of consumers reporting that jobs are easy to find remains high, and is consistent with the unemployment rate falling below 4% in the months ahead. Meanwhile, the net balance expecting their incomes to rise points to wage growth accelerating to around 3% annualised by the end of the year. Amazon has just smashed another stock market landmark, as its surging rally continues. Shares in the e-commerce, web streaming and cloud computing giant have just hit $1,000 for the first time ever. Astonishingly, Amazon\u2019s shares have gained around 33% since the start of 2017 -- helping to drive the Nasdaq to a series of record highs. Shares have dipped on Wall Street at the start of trading, as the New York stock market follows Europe\u2019s lead. Energy companies are under some pressure, after Goldman cut its oil price forecasts. It now expects Brent crude to average $55.39 per barrel this year, down from a previous estimate of $56.76/barrel. The Greek prime minister\u2019s office is reporting that Alexis Tsipras has hit the phones in calls aimed squarely at putting across Greece\u2019s desire for some sort of debt agreement at the next euro group meeting on June 15. The prime minister Alexis Tsipras spoke yesterday with the German chancellor Angela Merkel and the French president Emmanuel Macron, and just a little while earlier he had a telephone discussion with European Council president Donald Tusk. A statement released from Tsipras\u2019s office says: The prime minister conveyed the position of the Greek side of the need for a clear solution to the issue of Greek debt and everyone agreed they would continue to work ahead of the euro group on 15 June.\u201d When the going has got tough, Tsipras has often tried in the past to bypass creditor institutions by seeking a political solution at prime ministerial level ..... Newsflash: US house prices are rising at their fastest pace in almost three years. Prices across 20 key US cities jumped by 5.9% year-on-year in March, with low supply helping to keep prices buoyant. That\u2019s according to the S&amp;P/ Case-Shiller index, which also found that overall prices rose by 5.8%. Associated Press adds: Home values are increasing at more than double the pace of average hourly earnings, making it more difficult for many people to afford to buy a home. A steady job market has bulked up demand among many would-be buyers, but there are fewer properties on the market. Sales listings have plummeted 9 percent over the past year to 1.93 million, according to the National Association of Realtors. Back in Athens, a government official has told my colleague Helena Smith that Greece \u201cis not threatening anyone\u201d over its bailout deadlock. He reiterated Euclid Tsakalotos\u2019s comments this morning, saying: \u201cThere is no risk of default and please don\u2019t make it seem as if there is one. \u201cEveryone is talking about Greece and so we felt that it was necessary to talk ourselves,\u201d the official added, referring to the Greek finance minister\u2019s decision to speak directly to foreign correspondents on Monday. Tsakalotos also told the Guardian on the sidelines of Monday\u2019s hastily arranged press conference that \u201cwe want to tell our side of the story.\u201d Asked if Greece could possibly reject the \u20ac7bn bailout loans due to be released, Tsakalotos insisted that \u201cno-one\u201d expected the disbursement to be a problem. \u201cIt is already on a path ... it is already moving.\u201d But the Oxford educated economist had also said he did not want \u201cto go into the tactics\u201d Greece\u2019s leftist led government might pursue..... We have good news for German shoppers -- inflation in the eurozone\u2019s largest economy has hit a five month low. Germany\u2019s Consumer Price Index rose by just 1.4% in May, sharply down from 2.0% in April. That\u2019s a bigger fall than expected, and means the cost of living is rising by less than the European Central Bank\u2019s target of just below 2%. This takes some of the pressure off the ECB to start unwinding its stimulus programme, says ING\u2019s Carsten Brzeski. The FT\u2019s Mehreen Khan points out that German\u2019s economy is enjoying a purple patch, with unemployment low and inflation so modest. Greece\u2019s finance minister has hit back at claims that Athens might waive its next bailout payment, a move which would trigger a new summer debt crisis. Euclid Tsakalotos told Reuters that Bild, the German tabloid, had misinterpreted his call on Monday for Greece\u2019s creditors to reach a deal next month or risk a new economic crisis. Tsakalotos insisted that Athens is not considering waiving the \u20ac7bn loan which is due....over once all sides are happy about Greece\u2019s economic reforms, and have agreed a debt relief strategy. But Tsakalotos also stuck to his guns on debt relief, saying his government can\u2019t support a deal that doesn\u2019t tackle this issue. He said: \u201cBild has distorted what I said yesterday. \u201cWhat I did say is that the disbursement (of bailout money) was not an issue, because all sides agreed that we have kept to our commitment. But the Greek government feels that a disbursement without clarity on debt is not enough to turn the Greek economy around.\u201d In the roundabout world of Greek bailouts, Athens needs to persuade its creditors to hand over this \u20ac7bn aid tranche in June, so that it can hand it straight back to its lenders in July when various bonds mature. So if it were to \u2018waive\u2019 this loan, it would find itself in a very sticky situation this summer.... The threat of a \u201ccoalition of chaos\u201d has been a major factor in Theresa May\u2019s election campaign, as she urges voters to trust her to negotiate Brexit. But JP Morgan have argued that a centre-left alliance could actually be positive for the pound, if it steered Britain towards a softer exit from the EU. In a new research note, strategist Paul Meggyesi estimates that there is an 86% chance of a Tory majority, despite the \u201calmost continuous decline\u201d in the party\u2019s lead over Labour since the election was called. Meggyesi also believes that sterling wouldn\u2019t necessarily crash if May suffered a shock rejection at the ballot box. Instead, the pound could actually rally if Jeremy Corbyn, Tim Farron and Nicola Sturgeon hammered out a coalition. Meggyesi says: A hung parliament would in more normal circumstances be viewed as quite negative for the British pound [GBP] \u2013 that was very much the experience of the 2015 election when GBP was braced for one of a myriad of potential coalition permutations only for GBP to jump by 3% once David Cameron secured an improbable narrow majority. But in the post-referendum world, all political developments need to be viewed through a Brexit prism and an argument can be made that a hung parliament which delivered or held out the prospect of a softer-Brexit coalition of the left-of-centre parties (Labour/Lib Dems/SNP) might actually be GBP positive. FX investors might not exactly embrace various aspects of the Labour party\u2019s domestic policy agenda (the renationalisation of certain sectors, a large fiscal expansion), but they could potentially live with these as the price of a less disruptive Brexit under a government that was more willing to preserve the status quo on free movement of labour and trade (the Lib Dems have also committed to holding a second referendum on the final terms of a Brexit deal) Eurozone economic confidence remains close to its highest level since the financial crisis, new figures show, despite a dip this month. The European Commission\u2019s eurozone economic sentiment index fell to 109.2 in May, down from 109.7 in April, dragged down by a drop in service sector confidence Economists had expected it to rise to a new 10-year high of 110. But more encouragingly, confidence within the manufacturing industry rose, from 2.6 to 2.8. Investors are blaming Mario Draghi, head of the European Central Bank, for the euro\u2019s weakness this morning. Draghi\u2019s dovish appearance before the European Parliament yesterday are dragging on the single currency, despite the better economic news from France today. Paresh Davdra, CEO of RationalFX, cites Draghi\u2019s reluctance to unwind the ECB\u2019s stimulus programme: The euro has seen a difficult start to the week as it was hurt by fears over Greek debt, the prospect of an early Italian election and comments from ECB President Mario Draghi suggesting continued monetary support for the Eurozone. It is Draghi\u2019s comments in particular that have led the currency to slip, as increasing signs of economic recovery including positive data releases have led to analysts hoping that the ECB\u2019s dovish policies may be narrowed down. After Macron helped the shared currency to rally, investors would have been hoping for the euro\u2019s good fortunes to continue. Just as it is with the pound, political uncertainty has made the euro volatile, and analysts will be hoping that more stability lies ahead for the euro as events continue to develop.\u201d Sweden\u2019s economy had a disappointing start to this year, new GDP figures show. The Swedish economy grew by 0.4% in January-March, down from 0.7% in Q4 2016, and only half as fast as expected. More here. Here\u2019s some reaction to this morning\u2019s upbeat French economic data: New inflation figures how that consumer prices across Germany rose at a slower rate this month: We get the overall German inflation report at 1pm BST. And a low reading will strengthen the European Central Bank\u2019s determination not to end its monetary stimulus programme too soon. European stock markets have fallen in early trading, putting them on track for their fourth day of losses. Worries over Greece\u2019s bailout, a possible early Italian general election, and Mario Draghi\u2019s cautious comments about the eurozone recovery are all weighing on shares. Britain\u2019s FTSE has lost 0.5%, partly thanks to IAG\u2019s 4% slide. Mining stocks and banks are also losing ground: Connor Campbell of SpreadEx says: The FTSE was one of the worst performers after the bell, plunging more than half a percent to lurk just above 7500. A 1% drop from copper \u2013 the metal is now at its worst price in a week and a half \u2013 weighed on the index\u2019s mining stocks, while the ongoing British Airway\u2019s chaos is hurting its parent IAG, which fell 3.5% as the session got underway. The UK banks were also all in the red, taking their cue from their Italian counterparts, which plunged on early election fears. This morning\u2019s selloff has wiped around \u00a3500m off IAG\u2019s market capitalisation. Shares in British Airways\u2019 parent company have slumped to the bottom of the London stock market this morning, after a long weekend of disruption. International Airlines Group\u2019s shares fell by 4% at the start of trading, as investors try to calculate the cost of the IT problems that disrupted hundred of flights. BA cancelled all its flights from Heathrow and Gatwick (London\u2019s two largest airports) on Saturday, and there were further delays on Sunday as the airline battled to recover the situation. Experts reckon the compensation bill could hit \u00a3100m, but the long-term impact of the crisis is hard to assess. BA blamed a power supply outage, and denied that a cyberattack was to blame. But unions pointed out that BA has made hundreds of IT staff redundant recently. Kathleen Brooks, research director at City Index, believes BA\u2019s reputation could be significantly damaged by the crisis: Even if you give BA the benefit of the doubt it still looks bad, if their systems are not strong enough to withstand a power surge, then this sort of thing could happen again, which could add downward pressure to the IAG stock price. Although cost cutting has been good for the share price in the last year, it will come back to bite IAG if it stops them from doing what they are supposed to do: fly passengers to their destinations. Greece\u2019s government has scrambled to deny Bilt\u2019s report that it might default on its next debt repayment in July. Reuters has the details: A Greek government spokesman denied a German newspaper report on Tuesday that it was considering opting out of a loan repayment in July if lenders could not agree on debt relief. \u201cIt is not true,\u201d government spokesman Dimitris Tzanakopoulos told Reuters. \u201cThere will be a solution on June 15.\u201d Newsflash: France\u2019s economy is growing faster than first estimated. Statistics body INSEE has reported that French GDP expanded by 0.4% in January-March, up from the 0.3% first estimated. That means France grew twice as fast as the UK in the first three months of this year. And in another boost for new president Emmanuel Macron, French consumer confidence is now rising at its fastest rate in a decade. INSEE\u2019s index of consumer morale has jumped to 102 in May, up from 100 in April, wth households saying they\u2019re more optimistic about the economic situation. Growing concerns over Greece\u2019s bailout programme are weighing on the euro this morning. The European single currency has shed almost 0.5% to $1.113, on concerns that Athens and its creditors may not reach an agreement over its bailout programme in time. Overnight, finance minister Euclid Tsakalotos warned that Greece\u2019s delicate recovery would be derailed if eurozone finance ministers didn\u2019t agree to release its next loan in June. Tsakalotos told journalists in Athens that Greece deserves to be given the debt relief promised by its lenders, if it stuck to its austerity programme. He said it is now vital that a real is reached on June 15, adding: \u201cWe can\u2019t accept a deal which is not what was on the table. What was on the table was if Greece carried out its reform package then creditors would ensure that there would be a clear runway through clarity for debt.\u201d Greece had hoped to receive its latest bailout payment this month, but eurozone ministers couldn\u2019t reach an agreement with the International Monetary Fund. Athens faces \u20ac7bn of debt repayments this summer, so there is concern that the eurozone debt crisis could flare up again soon. Germany\u2019s Bilt newspaper is claiming this morning that it might \u2018skip\u2019 its next bailout payment, if a deal on debt relief hasn\u2019t been reached. That\u2019s added to the anxiety this morning: The euro is also suffering from worries over Italy, where former prime minister Matteo Renzi is pushing for early elections - perhaps in September. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. The pound is dipping in early trading today as anxiety over next month\u2019s general election continues to build. Sterling is down 0.2% this morning at $1.281, after a new opinion poll showed that the Conservatives have a lead of just six percentage points over Labour. After a similarly tight YouGov poll last week, City investors are less confident Last night, prime minister Theresa May and Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn both faced off against veteran political journalist Jeremy Paxman. Both sides are (predictably) claiming victory, after a robust (but not desperately enlightening) encounter that saw Corbyn deny being a dictator, and May accused of being \u201ca blowhard who collapses at the first sign of gunfire\u201d. The London stock market is expected to drop a little when trading resumes after the Bank Holiday weekend, having hit a record high on Friday night. We also get a raft of new eurozone economic data this morning, that may show if the European recovery is on track. Here\u2019s the agenda: 7.45am: The second estimate of French GDP for Q1 2017 is released. 10am: Eurozone economic confidence figures for May are published; economists expect another strong reading 1pm: German inflation figures for May are published, and may show that the CPI rate fell to 1.6%, from 2% in April 2pm: The S&amp;P/Case Shiller index of US house prices is released 3pm: US consumer confidence figures for May",

      "bodyText": "Rising prices on the back of the Brexit vote and the trend towards more insecure work will rob British workers of any growth in real wages this year, with repercussions for the wider economy, a new report has warned. With just over a week to go until a snap general election largely focused on looming Brexit negotiations, economists at the ratings agency Standard &amp; Poor\u2019s are the latest to highlight the blow to living standards from last year\u2019s vote to leave the EU. The referendum result did not deliver the drastic hit to economic growth that some had predicted but it did send the pound sharply lower. That has made imports to the UK more expensive, helping to push inflation up to its highest level in more than three years. On the latest official figures, inflation had overtaken meagre wage growth, leaving workers worse off in real terms. S&amp;P expects that trend to continue this year and it says the next government will have to boost spending on infrastructure to improve the UK\u2019s sluggish productivity and turn the tide on household incomes. Boris Glass, one of the report\u2019s authors, said that after the UK\u2019s GDP growth slowed markedly to 0.2% in the opening quarter of 2017, from 0.7% at the end of last year, the pattern was likely to continue as stresses on household finances weighed on consumer spending. \u201cThe resulting weakening of household purchasing power will likely translate into weaker consumer spending, which is a key factor behind the slow GDP growth we anticipate for the rest of this year, after the economy expanded by only 0.2% in the first quarter,\u201d he said. He said real wage growth should turn positive again next year, partly because employers will have adjusted pay for higher inflation by then. \u201cBut several factors are likely to keep constraining pay growth in our view,\u201d he added. The recent return to falling real wages compounds the pain for British workers who suffered years of declining living standards in the wake of the financial crisis. Glass described the result as \u201cmore than a decade of lost earnings growth in absolute levels\u201d. While the biggest factor behind the latest rise in inflation was the Brexit vote, there were other reasons for weak wage growth, the S&amp;P report said. One explanation was the UK\u2019s poor record on productivity, a measure of economic efficiency or what is produced for every hour worked. The UK has lagged behind its peers in terms of productivity growth and what little improvement there has been has not been fully passed on to workers in higher wages, S&amp;P said. \u201cReal wages have so far failed to catch up even with very weak productivity\u2026 What\u2019s more, with productivity growth remaining so sluggish, there is not much for real wages to catch up to. Real pay growth will likely remain muted until productivity numbers rebound,\u201d said Glass. \u201cAt least some of the productivity loss could be reversed by boosting investment spending, including on infrastructure. Unfortunately, this is unlikely to occur to the extent necessary in the near to medium term.\u201d He also warned that the overdue catch-up of real wages with productivity could be further delayed as a result of more muted growth prospects due to Brexit. But poor productivity growth was only part of the problem, Glass added. Real wages were currently still well below the norm, even at such low productivity levels. Another key factor in weak wage growth was the quality of employment, the S&amp;P report said, noting official figures showing that in the fourth quarter of last year, around 900,000 jobs were based on zero-hour contracts. \u201cThese types of jobs, often in consumer-facing services where relatively low skill levels are required, made up almost one-quarter of all employment created since 2010 when the recovery started, and this seems to be part of a broader trend,\u201d it added. \u201cJobs created since the global financial crisis have tended to be in occupations with relatively low productivity and less secure, including low paid self-employment and part-time employment.\u201d",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Adani has agreed to a new royalties deal with the Queensland government, weeks after an earlier proposal was junked amid internal uproar that it gave the Carmichael coal project too much taxpayer support. On Friday, ministers attended a snap cabinet meeting and agreed a royalties \u201choliday\u201d for Adani\u2019s $16bn project, Australia\u2019s biggest proposed coal mine, would be wound back. On Tuesday evening, Adani announced it had agreed to a deal, which \u201cmet its expectations and requirements\u201d. \u201cThe royalties arrangement means the project is back on track to generate 10,000 direct and indirect jobs in regional Queensland,\u201d the company said in a statement. Adani on Tuesday said the mine in its first phase would involve production of 25m tonnes of thermal coal a year, and a 388km rail line to haul it to the company-owned Abbot Point port. The mine would then ramp up to 60m tonnes a year, making it one of the biggest in the world. Environmental campaigners and scientists are concerned about the impact of carbon emissions from its coal, which will be equivalent to some of the world\u2019s biggest carbon-polluting countries. The port, near Bowen in north Queensland, and near the Great Barrier Reef marine park, would be expanded from a capacity of 50m tonnes a year to 120m tonnes a year in the mine\u2019s later phase, Adani said. It said the board of its Indian parent company would make a \u201cfinal investment decision\u201d at its next meeting, understood to be within weeks. That would be the trigger for what the company has flagged would be $100m to $400m of preliminary works. But the deadline for financial close, the securing of bank backing to build the mine and rail to haul coal to the coast, is early 2018. It\u2019s understood Adani would need to pay at least $5m a year for the first five years of production under the new deal, with interest charged on anything owed to the state above that. The previous proposal involved payments of $2m a year, and reportedly could see the state belatedly seeking to claw back up to $320m forgone in the early years. Adani\u2019s billionaire chairman, Gautam Adani, personally thanked the Queensland premier, Annastacia Palaszczuk, \u201cand the elected members of the state for their continued support to make this happen\u201d. \u201cI also wish to thank the prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, and opposition leader, Bill Shorten, for their support for the changes to the native title bill,\u201d Adani said. The company said Shorten has assured it of Labor support for the native title changes to stop a legal precedent that would have killed off its crucial land access deal with mine site traditional owners. That deal remains the subject of legal challenges by an anti-Adani faction of the Wangan and Jagalingou owners, which are set to run until at least October. The Palaszczuk government announced on Saturday it would not act as \u201cmiddle man\u201d for a $900m Northern Australia Infrastructure Facility loan to Adani, its cabinet ruling this was in line with an election promise not to give taxpayer support to the miner. On Monday, Barnaby Joyce condemned the refusal, telling the ABC there was a \u201cbig, big issue there\u201d with state Labor.",

      "bodyText": "The market value of the British Airways owner, IAG, has fallen by \u00a3170m after computer system outages grounded hundreds of flights over the weekend. IAG shares fell more than 4% to 588p in early trading in London on Tuesday after the flight cancellations left 75,000 passengers stranded over the bank holiday weekend and disrupted travel plans for many more. Later in the day they recovered some of the losses, closing down 1.4% \u2013 cutting the value of the airline group by \u00a3170m. BA cancelled all departing flights at London\u2019s Heathrow and Gatwick airports on Saturday when check-in and operating systems crashed. The breakdown left the airline struggling even to locate and contact its staff. There were chaotic scenes at the airport. Passengers slept on yoga mats on terminal floors on Saturday night, and flights on Sunday and Monday were also affected. BA said its systems had now been restored and it was back to running a full flight schedule on Tuesday. An investigation is to follow, although the airline said its immediate priority was to ensure remaining passengers who had not been rebooked and still wished to travel could do so. BA is facing a compensation bill that could top \u00a3150m, according to some estimates. According to reports, some passengers had to spend up to \u00a3800 for spare seats in premium economy cabins to reach their destinations, while customers who travelled with other airlines incurred extra costs of up to \u00a31,600. The airline said it had advised passengers to let BA rebook their seats, and about 50,000 people had been rebooked by BA on to more than 30 different airlines. Asked whether passengers who had booked their own travel would be reimbursed in full, the BA spokeswoman said the airline would look at this case by case. A significant number of customers who did fly from the UK still did not have their luggage, BA admitted, but it said it was working hard to resolve this. A spokeswoman said couriers would return the bags to passengers but added that it would \u201ctake some days to get every bag back to every customer\u201d. Customers said they had been told tens of thousands of bags were being kept in warehouses at Heathrow. Ola Holmstrom, 44, from London, whose family bank holiday break to see relatives in Sweden was aborted, said he had still not been reunited with luggage that included prescription medicine and his wife\u2019s glasses. Holmstrom had returned to Heathrow twice after being unable to contact BA online or by phone. He said he was a frequent flyer, adding: \u201cWe\u2019ve chosen to be loyal to BA but you question your loyalty at times like these.\u201d BA said it would also reimburse phone charges, after it came under fire for pointing some affected customers to premium phone lines costing up to 62p a minute from some mobiles. The airline said it had a freephone number \u2013 0800 727 800 \u2013 for people affected by the IT failure. And a spokeswoman said customers could add phone charges to any claims they submitted for consideration. Hannah Maundrell, the editor-in-chief of money.co.uk, said: \u201cIf you\u2019ve paid out for seats in premium economy cabins or chosen to fly with a different airline, you\u2019re still entitled to a full refund of your original ticket, plus compensation under EU legislation. BA may not cover your alternative travel costs in full, but this will be decided on a case-by-case basis so it\u2019s worth asking. \u201cIf you\u2019ve been advised by BA to book flights with another airline and claim back the costs from them, make sure you keep a record of who you spoke to, as well as copies of receipts and flight passes.\u201d Under European regulations, passengers can get up to \u20ac600 per person in compensation for cancelled flights. They can also claim for food, phone calls and accommodation. Maundrell advised passengers to contact BA directly (claims companies will deduct a percentage of each claim) and to go to the Civil Aviation Authority if their claim was rejected. BA\u2019s chief executive, Alex Cruz, who has faced calls to resign, apologised to customers and promised a full investigation into the IT disaster. He said there was no evidence there had been a cyber-attack. Cruz gave his first interviews on the failure on Monday, telling Sky News: \u201cOn Saturday morning at around 9.30am there was indeed a power surge that had a catastrophic effect over some communications hardware which eventually affected all the messaging across our systems.\u201d The explanation provoked further confusion, however, with IT specialists querying whether a power surge could cause such failure and electricity providers saying they had no evidence of such a surge. SSE said its network was operating as normal in the Harmondsworth area on Saturday morning. A BA spokesperson said on Tuesday there was a \u201cpower supply issue\u201d but that there still needed to be a full investigation. Cruz, who founded the budget carrier Clickair and ran the Spanish airline Vueling before moving to BA last year, said the outsourcing of jobs was not to blame for the \u201ccatastrophic\u201d IT failure, after the GMB union suggested the mass travel disruption could have been prevented if the airline had not cut \u201chundreds of dedicated and loyal\u201d IT staff and contracted the work to India in 2016. In a statement, BA said: \u201cWe are extremely sorry for the frustration and inconvenience customers experienced over the bank holiday weekend and thank them for their patience and understanding. We are continuing to work to get delayed bags to customers as quickly as possible and information on how to track a bag can be found on ba.com.\u201d Competitors have already profited from the incident, with Ryanair reporting a surge in last-minute bookings. The airline said it had reviewed its own systems after this weekend, but had never had a major outage, with backup systems in three different locations around Europe and regular disaster recovery testing. Contrasting the airline\u2019s operation to BA\u2019s outsourced IT, Ryanair\u2019s chief financial officer, David O\u2019Brien, said: \u201cAll of our investment in IT is in-house, in Europe \u2013 Dublin, Madrid and Rostoff \u2013 proximate to our business, and expensive. We invest our money where it needs to be.\u201d IAG\u2019s chief executive, Willie Walsh, has yet to make a public statement on the incident. An IAG spokeswoman said the group never commented on movements in the share price. George Salmon, an equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: \u201cWhile the costs of passenger compensation and refunds could well run into the tens of millions, the whole sorry episode has undeniably put a dent in BA\u2019s reputation for delivering a premium service, and the worry for shareholders is that this unquantifiable impact could have longer-term consequences.\u201d",

    "webTitle": "BT considering closing defined-benefit pensions scheme for existing staff", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "BT is considering closing its defined-benefit pension scheme, the latest former state-owned business to close \u2013 or move to close \u2013 so-called \u201cgold-plated\u201d retirement plans for existing employees. It comes as the telecoms group prepares to enter negotiations with pension trustees about the future funding of the scheme from next month. It follows a similar, but more advanced, proposal by the recently privatised Royal Mail Group, where plans to shut its defined-benefit pension scheme to existing workers next year has resulted in threats of strike action. A BT spokesman said it would be inappropriate to comment on the details of its forthcoming pension review, but added: \u201cWe are starting discussions with the trustee of the BT pension scheme about the triennial valuation. \u201cWe don\u2019t expect this process to be completed until the first half of 2018 at the very earliest.\u201d If BT opts to close the scheme to current workers in favour of a cheaper arrangement it is likely to prove highly controversial, as such a move would dramatically reducethe total renumeration packages that employees have signed up to. The Communications Workers Union, which represents Royal Mail as well as BT employees, has already threatened to hold a ballot for industrial action among members at the postal service. A defined-benefit pension is typically considered the most sought-after retirement plan available to employees, and pays an annual income based on a calculation based on years of service and either a career average or final salary. Businesses have increasingly argued such \u201cgold-plated\u201d schemes are unaffordable. BT\u2019s \u00a350bn pensions scheme was found to have aa deficit of about \u00a37bn at the last formal review in 2014. However, very low interest rates and an ageing membership means that deficit may have risen to as much as \u00a314bn. Companies first attempted to cut the costs of providing defined-benefit schemes by closing the plans to new members \u2013 with BTdoing so in 2001. More recently, companies have begun to try to limit the benefits payable to those already enrolled in the schemes and are still accruing benefits as current employees. These cuts can be achieved by closing the fund to contributions, essentially freezing the final salaries of middle to junior staff who may have been expecting their retirement income to be calculated on a more senior position. Apart from Royal Mail and BT, other large companies such as the Post Office and Marks &amp; Spencer have also announced they would close their defined benefits schemes for future accruals. If BT decides to impose a cap on benefits for existing members, it would affect about 33,000 employees paying into the scheme out of a total of about 300,00 members. In its latest annual annual report, published last week, the telecoms group told shareholders: \u201cWe have a large funding obligation to our defined benefit (DB) pension schemes. The largest of these, the BT pension scheme (BTPS), represents over 97% of our pension obligations. The BTPS faces similar risks to other UK DB schemes: things like future low investment returns, high inflation, longer life expectancy and regulatory changes may all mean the BTPS becomes more of a financial burden.\u201d The report continued: \u201cIf there\u2019s an increase in the pension deficit at the next valuation date, we may have to increase deficit payments into the scheme. Higher deficit payments could mean less money available to invest, pay out as dividends or repay debt as it matures, which could in turn affect our share price and credit rating. \u201cWe\u2019re considering a number of options for funding the deficit after the next valuation, as of 30 June 2017. These options include considering whether there are alternative approaches to only making cash payments, including arrangements that would give the BTPS a prior claim over certain BT assets.\u201d",

The Communications Workers Union, which represents Royal Mail as well as BT employees, has already threatened to hold a ballot for industrial action among members at the postal service. </p> <p>A defined-benefit pension is typically considered the most sought-after retirement plan available to employees, and pays an annual income based on a calculation based on years of service and either a career average or final salary.</p> <p>Businesses have increasingly argued such \u201cgold-plated\u201d schemes are unaffordable. BT\u2019s \u00a350bn pensions scheme was found to have aa deficit of about \u00a37bn at the last formal review in 2014. However, very low interest rates and an ageing membership means that deficit may have risen to as much as \u00a314bn.</p> <p>Companies first attempted to cut the costs of providing defined-benefit schemes by closing the plans to new members \u2013 with BTdoing so in 2001.</p> <p>More recently, companies have begun to try to limit the benefits payable to those already enrolled in the schemes and are still accruing benefits as current employees. These cuts can be achieved by closing the fund to contributions, essentially freezing the final salaries of middle to junior staff who may have been expecting their retirement income to be calculated on a more senior position.</p> <p>Apart from Royal Mail and BT, other large companies such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/blog/2016/aug/13/scandal-closure-company-pension-schemes\">the Post Office and Marks &amp; Spencer have also announced they would close their defined benefits schemes</a> for future accruals.</p> <p>If BT decides to impose a cap on benefits for existing members, it would affect about 33,000 employees paying into the scheme out of a total of about 300,00 members.</p> <p>In its latest annual annual report, published last week, the telecoms group told shareholders: \u201cWe have a large funding obligation to our defined benefit (DB) pension schemes. The largest of these, the BT pension scheme (BTPS), represents over 97% of our pension obligations. The BTPS faces similar risks to other UK DB schemes: things like future low investment returns, high inflation, longer life expectancy and regulatory changes may all mean the BTPS becomes more of a financial burden.\u201d<br></p> <p>The report continued: \u201cIf there\u2019s an increase in the pension deficit at the next valuation date, we may have to increase deficit payments into the scheme. Higher deficit payments could mean less money available to invest, pay out as dividends or repay debt as it matures, which could in turn affect our share price and credit rating.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re considering a number of options for funding the deficit after the next valuation, as of 30 June 2017. These options include considering whether there are alternative approaches to only making cash payments, including arrangements that would give the BTPS a prior claim over certain BT assets.\u201d</p>",
