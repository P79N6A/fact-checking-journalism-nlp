      "bodyText": "Breaking! The Dow Jones industrial average has ended its eight-day long run of losses, and avoided its worst losing streak in almost 40 years. The benchmark index has closed up around 0.75%, as Wall Street regained its poise after some nervous sessions. Traders cited the surge in consumer confidence to a 16-year high today, and hopes that Donald Trump will manage to get his tax reforms (tax cuts, more likely) through Congress. Tom Porcelli of RBC Capital Markets says: One of the most fundamental drivers of the backdrop is employment. What we just got from the Conference Board\u2019s consumer confidence report should embolden those that believe continued labor market tightening (and accelerating wage growth) is in the offing. Financial stocks, and consumer goods makers, led the rally. The top performer on the Dow was Apple, which closed at a new alltime high of $143.92 per share. And on that note, we\u2019re wrapping up. Goodnight and thanks for reading and commenting. GW With just 10 minutes to go, the Dow Jones industrial average is on track to break its losing streak. The Dow\u2019s currently up 160 points, or almost 0.8%, at 20,712 points. Surely nothing can shake the rally?.... Art Hogan, chief market strategist at Wunderlich Equity Capital Markets in New York, believes improved economic data (such as today\u2019s consumer confidence figures) are helping share prices today. He says (via Reuters): This market is driven by two things - the hope of policy agenda getting put into place and improving fundamentals. Here\u2019s our news story about Britain\u2019s newest coin, and the challenges we faced when trying to use it... Wall Street might avoid racking up its worst run of losses since 1978. The main indices are all in green right now, meaning the Dow Jones Industrial Average is on track to avoid its ninth fall in a row. Investors are cheered by the news that US consumer confidence has hit a 16-year high today. However, they\u2019re also still pondering Donald Trump\u2019s ability to get his legislative agenda through Congress.... Back in South Africa, the rand remains under pressure as investors continue to fret that finance minister Pravin Gordhan could be replaced soon. There\u2019s no official word about Gordhan\u2019s position, since he was told to cut short his trip to meet European and US investors and return home this morning. And this lack of clarity means the rand is down 1.65% today at 12.95 to the US dollar. A weaker pound ahead of the triggering of Article 50 on Wednesday boosted the FTSE 100, which is packed with overseas earners who benefit from any slip in sterling. Positive results from building materials group Wolseley also helped matters, as did an early rise on Wall Street after eight days of decline. Meanwhile European markets were also recovering, while oil prices moved higher after problems with supplies in Libya. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished up 0.68% or 49.92 points at 7343.42 Germany\u2019s Dax rose 1.28% to 12,149.42 France\u2019s Cac closed 0.57% higher at 5046.20 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB climbed 1.02% to 20,330.42 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended up 0.84% at 10,389.0 In Greece, the Athens market added 2.78% to 664.52 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 90 points or 0.44%. The pound has slipped back further following McCafferty\u2019s comments, and is now down 0.46% at $1.2497. Investec\u2019s chief economist says: There may also be some effect from the vote in the Scottish Parliament to call for a second independence referendum. Ian McCafferty, a member of the Bank of England\u2019s monetary policy committee, is on radio station LBC\u2019s phone in at the moment. My colleague Katie Allen is following the broadcast: A cry of excitement went up at Chapel market as a new pound coin was used to pay for eight tangerines. But John, who has run the neighbouring picture framing stall for more than twenty years, said he was disappointed by its appearance. \u201cIt looks like a token, not a proper coin. it seems unfair to me that businesses such as Arcade owners etc are having to pay for the costs of converting machines. That should be a cost that the Government covers.\u201d In Islington the vast majority of parking meters have been converted to payment by mobile phone only. HSBC at Baker Street was one of several bank branches we popped into to question availability, and where staff said they did not expect to receive the new coin until Friday at the earliest. Even cabbies are up in arms over the changes. Black cab driver Ivan Sobell from Barnet, North London, accepted a new one one as payment, only to find out that it is slightly too big to fit into his coin tube, where he stashes up to fifteen coins at a time. \u201cI\u2019ll have to invest in a smartie tube\u201d, he joked, saying it was the first - and likely to be the last - he had received in a fare today. Coin-operated launderettes - a dying species these days - are also likely to disappoint users holding only the new coins. At the Barbican launderette, a bank of giant washer dryers still take only the old coins, for 19 minutes drying time. Back with our test drive of the new pound coin: At Chapel market in Islington, north London, a busy shopping centre where major supermarkets fringe an old-fashioned fruit and vegetable market, no shoppers had yet seen the new coin and there was no information from retailers informing them of it. A hundred-odd trolleys linked together and locked outside the large Sainsbury\u2019s had \u2018dual slots\u2019 designed to accommodate the old pound coin and the one euro coin. The new twelve-sided coin fits into the slot that accommodates the euro so there has been no need to upgrade the trolleys. Thanks to the helpful member of Sainsbury\u2019s staff who came outside to show me and explain to other shoppers. The same dual slot is also in use in frozen food store Iceland. Waitrose\u2019s trolleys had no locks at all, and the nearby Marks &amp; Spencer had only plastic trolley-style baskets with extendable handles, which are not lockable. But at the nearby Tesco Metro on Islington Green, the trolleys in use had old-style locks which take only the old-style pound and not the new one. Shoppers said they would have to remember to always have an old coin in a handy place. Tesco has promised that it will unlock all trolleys that are not compatible with the new coin, but this store has obviously slipped through the net. Capital Economics suggests that the triggering of Article 50 - finally - could actually give some support to the pound. Economist Jonathan Loynes said: While the triggering of Article 50 is a major step along the road to Brexit, it will hardly come as a shock. Any suggestions that the UK might not actually leave the EU disappeared months ago. And the 52% of referendum voters who wanted Brexit will presumably be pleased to see the process finally commence. Indeed, it\u2019s perhaps more likely that the formal commencement of Brexit will give the pound another boost. If the UK government\u2019s letter announcing Article 50 contains conciliatory language, and this is echoed in the response from the EU, then hard Brexit worries could certainly dissipate somewhat further. If an easing of Brexit worries does raise the pound further, this will no doubt be seen by many as a positive development. But it wouldn\u2019t be unambiguously good news. After all, sterling\u2019s post-referendum depreciation has boosted exporters\u2019 order books and helped to facilitate some long-desired rebalancing of the economy. And, if sustained, a stronger pound could prove an awkward obstacle to the process of normalising UK monetary policy which some MPC members are keen to commence in order to ease the distortions caused by very low interest rates and provide new ammunition with which to respond to the next economic downturn. For now, none of this will trouble the MPC too much. After all, the pound could soon start to drop back against the US dollar at least if, as we expect, market expectations for US interest rates start to rise again. And even if it doesn\u2019t, the MPC will instinctively prefer a strongish exchange rate to a weakish one. But a further significant rise in the pound could certainly present the Committee with some difficult choices. With Article 50 to be triggered on Wednesday, the pound is suffering some pre-Brexit jitters. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said: The pound [fell] by 0.3% against both the dollar and the euro after having been in the green before the bell rang on Wall Street. This in turn freed up the FTSE, which rose by 20 points to re-cross the 7300 mark it had been struggling with at lunchtime. It is going to be interesting to see how sterling behaves on Wednesday; Article 50 isn\u2019t like a Fed meeting, where a surprise could be sprung. It is almost just a formality, if, admittedly, one that carries a rather nasty reminder about the years of volatility and insecurity investors can expect as the Brexit negotiations officially get underway. US consumers seem to be taking things in their stride, with the latest confidence figures hitting their highest level since December 2000. The conference board consumer confidence index jumped from 116.1 in February to 125.6, with board director Lynn Franco saying: Consumers\u2019 assessment of current business and labour market conditions improved considerably. Consumers also expressed much greater optimism regarding the short-term outlook for business, jobs and personal income prospects. Thus, consumers feel current economic conditions have improved over the recent period, and their renewed optimism suggests the possibility of some upside to the prospects for economic growth in the coming months. Dennis de Jong, managing director at UFX.com, said: The incredible hike in consumer confidence will be a huge boost to US business, with the figures jumping to an unexpected 16-year high. Over in the US, and it looks like being touch and go whether the Dow Jones racks up its longest losing streak for nearly 40 years. After an opening fall, the Dow is now up 25 points although there is a long way yet to go. After the Trump rally following the US election result in November and the expectation that the new president would boost the economy with tax reforms and infrastructure spending the doubts have set in. The failure of Trump\u2019s healthcare bill has investors wondering whether he will be able to pass any of his other proposals and the uncertainty is taking the shine off the market, as well as weakening the dollar. But last night\u2019s recovery from its worst levels seems to be giving the US market some support at the moment. The new \u00a31 coin has passed its last test...it works in the luggage trolleys outside Kings Cross station. The parking meters in Lincoln\u2019s Inn Fields near the High Court in London also don\u2019t take the new pound coin. But there\u2019s better news at Holborn underground station; the new coin works in the ticket machines, so we\u2019ve topped up an Oyster card. Car drivers who try to park in Liverpool today will struggle to use the new \u00a31, judging by this photo: All you need to know about Britain\u2019s new \u00a31 coin, in just one minute: Eva Karras-Balint, receptionist at the London School of Economics\u2019 Old Building, likes the look of the new pound coin. She tells us: \u201cIt\u2019s gorgeous. It\u2019s definitely an improvement. It looks a bit like the \u00a32 coin and I like the way it looks.\u201d However, things take a disappointing turn when we try to spend our \u00a31 on a well-earned hot chocolate. The new quid does not work in a hot drinks vending machine at the London School of Economics. It falls straight through. Chris Whittall of the Wall Street Journal reckons the Dow could rack up its longest losing run in almost 40 years today, if it closes in the red again. Wall Street is expected to open cautiously in around 50 hour\u2019s time, as investors continue to digest Donald Trump\u2019s failure on healthcare reform. After eight falls in a row, the Dow is tipped to shed a few more points at the open. Fawad Razaqzada, market analyst at Forex.com, says traders are still edgy. Today, US index futures are currently pointing to a slightly weaker open, with European markets struggling to hold onto their earlier gains. So, there seems to be some stability in the markets at the time of this writing. But the lack of any major news or other fundamental events, there\u2019s little or no reason for the on-going \u2018risk-off\u2019 mood to turn decisively positive. Thus, equities could fall back later on today or this week, even if technically the markets look more stable. Put another way, safe haven assets like gold and Japanese yen may remain underpinned. More \u00a31 teething problems... You won\u2019t be able to make a phone call from a phone booth with the new pound coin - it came straight back out. Slightly embarrassingly, the new \u00a31 won\u2019t work on machines at the nearest pub to the Royal Mint\u2019s factory in Llantrisant, near Cardiff. According to Wales News, workers won\u2019t be able to use the 12-sided coin in the pool table of The Three Saints, or the children\u2019s toy machine either! Wales News reports: More than 300 million of the shiny new coins made at the Royal Mint at it\u2019s high-security Welsh base were released today. But many vending machines have not been adapted in time - including the Three Saints less than 200 yards from the entrance to the Mint. The fruit machine was altered just in time but the pool table and the children\u2019s toy vending machine is still old-school coins. Hotel worker Jade Davies said: \u201cSome workers came in last week to work on the fruit machine. They came in especially to alter it so it\u2019s ready for the new \u00a31 coin. \u201cBut the kid\u2019s toy machine won\u2019t accept the new coins just yet.\u201d South Eastern trains is rather belatedly going to put up signs on cash ticket machines this afternoon to alert customers to the introduction of the new coin. Cashiers in the ticket office in London Bridge had not seen any of the new coins yet (at least until The Guardian turned up with a handful). A customer in her 60s was intrigued and came over to look at the new coin. Pointing to her grey hair, she said: \u201cI\u2019m old enough to remember the old threepenny bit. it looks a bit like that.\u201d We\u2019ve tracked down Britain\u2019s shiny new \u00a31 coin, but found a few problems when we actually tried to spend one of them.... Julia Kollewe explains: We just tried to buy a \u00a33 ticket to London Bridge from Charing Cross but the new pound coin got stuck in the ticket machine (at least we got it back). Disappointing! But fortunately this tale has a happy ending... When we tried a different ticket machine we managed to buy the ticket with three brand new coins. Hooray! It\u2019s not looking very good for South Africa\u2019s finance minister.... South Africa\u2019s finance minister has landed back in the country, having been hauled back from his investor roadtrip by prime minister Zuma. Pravin Gordhan didn\u2019t sound too rattled when he met with reporters, saying; The president is my boss so if he asks us to come back, we come back. \u201cThere are many in government who want to do the right thing and make sure we keep our economy on track and keep our development moving in the right direction.\u201d The rand is still under pressure, though, thanks to those rumours that Gordhan could be sacked today. It\u2019s currently down 1.5% at 12.935 to the US dollar. It\u2019s an exciting day for numismatic lovers, as Britain\u2019s new \u00a31 coin goes into circulation. Billed as the \u201cmost secure\u201d coin of its type in the world, it is thinner, lighter and slightly bigger than the old quid. It also has 12 sides -- which is likely to cause problems with any vending machines that haven\u2019t been updated. The new \u00a31 coins also have a snazzy feature - a hologram-like image that changes from a \u201c\u00a3\u201d symbol to the number \u201c1\u201d when viewed from different angle. However..The newly minted \u00a31 coins are hard to get. My colleague Julia Kollewe reports that: Only certain bank branches had received them by this morning. At Santander in Triton Square, London, only customers of the bank can withdraw the new coins from their account, up to \u00a320. So if you find one today, at least you can watch it here: The problems that have dogged Sports Direct\u2019s warehouse in Derbyshire have not been fully addressed, MPs have heard this morning. Steve Turner, assistant general secretary of the Unite union, told the Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy committee that Mike Ashley\u2019s retail group have tackled some issues..but many others remain resolved. Turner explains to the committee that: 1) Sports Direct had refused to employ all its agency staff who make up the bulk of its workforce, as the union has pushed for. It is currently moving 10 workers per month onto its books, which means it would take 27 years to complete the job. 2) Those agency staff are still on contracts that only guarantee 366 hours per year, so a full-time worker will have used them up by the end of February. 3) There has been no progress on agreeing collective bargaining for workers at the Shirebrook site. More positively, Turner confirmed that the notorious \u2018six strikes and you\u2019re out\u2019 policy enforced by employment agencies has been axed, and Sports Direct has taken its own staff off zero hour\u2019s contracts. Where an issue has been in the public gaze, they\u2019ve taken action, Turner concluded. But where it\u2019s not, or where they\u2019ve said it\u2019s not their responsibility, they\u2019ve not taken action. You can watch the hearing here. Despite Wolseley\u2019s rally, the Footsie has now dipped into the red. Chris Beauchamp of IG reckons that traders are getting a touch of Brexit nerves, with Theresa May planning to trigger Article 50 on Wednesday. Beauchamp says: The recovery in US markets last night and a relatively positive session in Asia is not translating into gains for the FTSE 100 this morning, and the nearness of the Article 50 activation is undoubtedly contributing to the air of nervousness. A lack of newsflow continues to bedevil this market, but the rebound off the lows for Wall Street indicates that there is still plenty of buying pressure out there. Other European markets are still up though: Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 is being supported by Wolseley, the plumping and building chain. Its shares have jumped by over 6% today to a five-year high, after it cheered the City by posting a 25% rise in profits. The recovery was driven by Wolseley\u2019s business in North America, called Ferguson, which made up for tougher trading conditions in the UK and the Nordic regions. The firm also announced that it plans to rename itself Ferguson - good news for any of us who struggle to either spell or pronounce Wolseley (I normally plump for \u201cWool-zee\u201d). Asian markets have posted solid gains today as investors moved on from worrying about Donald Trump\u2019s healthcare setback. The Australian index jumped by 1.5%, Japan\u2019s Nikkei rose by 1.1%, and there were gains in Hong Kong too. Traders weren\u2019t too disconcerted by the US Dow racking up its eighth daily fall on Monday. Although that\u2019s the worst run since 2011, it\u2019s worth noting that the actual decline is quite modest - at just 1.7%. Hardly a Trump Slump (yet, anyway). Marc Ostwald of ADM Investor Services says: The \u2018Trump slump\u2019 narrative is an ugly piece of hyperbole. As but one example, the seven consecutive day fall in the Dow Industrials in the week to Friday amounted to a cumulative -1.69%, which is the third smallest 7-day setback in the history of the index. The head of Germany\u2019s Chambers of Commerce has claimed this morning that Brexit will have serious impact on trade with the UK. Eric Schweitzer warned that four in 10 German companies expect business with Britain to weaken, adding: \u201cWe should expect further declines in trade in the coming months.\u201d Of course, it all depends what kind of deal the UK and the rest of Europe can agree. London mayor Sadiq Khan has just called for an agreement that offers \u201ccontinued fortune and prosperity\u201d to both sides. More here: Kit Juckes of Societe Generale explains why shares are recovering from Monday\u2019s wobble: Bond and FX market participants\u2019 reaction to the failure of the healthcare bill has been to re-price Treasuries and the Dollar under the assumption that President Trump has lost a little of his shine. Equity market participants have taken a look at the lower yields and weaker dollar and decided that since absurdly low rates are the elixir that the equity bull market lives on, they might as well \u2018buy the dip\u2019 yet again. Meanwhile in the UK, supermarket chain Tesco will pay a \u00a3129m fine after coming to a settlement with the Serious Fraud Office over its 2014 accounting scandal. Tesco will also pay \u00a385m of compensation to investors who bought shares and bonds in summer 2014, shortly before the false accounting came to light. More here: Separately, two top Tesco shareholders have gone public with their concerns over its proposed takeover of wholesale food producer Booker. They fear that Tesco is paying too much, and might derail its own turnaround plan/. Shares in Booker are down 2% this morning. European stock markets have shaken off Monday\u2019s gloom, and opened higher this morning. Germany\u2019s DAX is the best performer, up around 0.5%, while Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 has gained a more more modest 0.15%. And the Stoxx 600 index, which tracks major companies across the region, is up 0.3%. The markets are calmer today, as investors ponder if Donald Trump can push through tax reforms, infrastructure spending and deregulate the US economy. FXTM chief market Strategist Hussein Sayed explains: The success of execution on any of these legislations is probably lower now than it was just last week, but investors are still giving President Trump the benefit of the doubt. However, if they see that these plans will face the same destiny as the Health Care Act, markets will soon turn to aggressive selling as the expected companies\u2019 earnings growth and pace of economic recovery are not enough to support currently overstretched valuations. According to Bloomberg\u2019s Sam Mkokeli, South African president Jacob Zuma told communist parties leaders that he\u2019s planning to sack finance minister Pravin Gordhan. He adds: Speculation that Gordhan is on the verge of being fired has swirled for months, as he clashed with Zuma over the management of state companies and the national tax agency. While Gordhan has led efforts to keep spending in check and fend off a junk credit rating, Zuma wants to embark on \u201cradical economic transformation\u201d that he says will tackle racial inequality and widespread poverty. The rand has now lost almost 5% of its value since yesterday lunchtime, when news broke that finance minister Gordhan had been summoned home; South Africa\u2019s currency is suffering heavy losses in early trading, on rumours that the country\u2019s finance minister is about be sacked. The rand tumbled by almost 2.2% at the open, to just 13.01 rand to the US dollar. As this video clip of the US dollar-rand exchange rate shows, it was a very sharp move indeed. South African government bonds also came under pressure, sending the yield (or interest rate) on the debt sharply higher. The selloff came after finances chief Pravin Gordhan was dramatically summoned back to South Africa, from a trip to meet investors in the UK and America. This has sparked speculation that prime minister Jacob Zuma might be planning a cabinet reshuffle. The two men have been locked in something of a power struggle recently, with Gordhan resisting pressure from Zuma to raise government spending and borrowing. They have also clashed over an influential business family, the Guptas, who are friendly with Zuma - and accused of wielding undue political influence. Bloomberg reported earlier today that Gordhan\u2019s job might be on the line. That helped to send the rand sliding, as the finance minister is popular with City investors. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. What goes down must come up again. So we\u2019re expecting Europe\u2019s financial markets to open higher today today, and claw back some of Monday\u2019s losses. Last night, America\u2019s Dow Jones Industrial Average racked up its longest losing streak since 2011, after the Republican Party was forced to pull its proposed replacement for Obamacare. The theory in the City today is that following his failure to get healthcare reform through Congress last week, Donald Trump will be determined to achieve some tax reforms. As Michael Hewson of CMC Markets explains: President Trump may have to modify his style somewhat, and add a few chapters to his book \u201cThe Art of the Deal\u201d and work on the art of the schmooze. His belligerent style may work well on the campaign trail but on Capitol Hill it doesn\u2019t work well at all. For all his optimism that he can park his health care reforms and come back to them later, while moving on to tax reform, and or infrastructure spending, there is rising scepticism amongst investors that he will fare much better on this score either, however some in the market do appear to want to give him the benefit of the doubt for now. However.... the president doesn\u2019t appear to be in the mood for schmoozing. Instead, he took to Twitter last night to blame his own side for the healthcare debacle: Also coming up today.... There may be drama in South Africa, after the country\u2019s finance minister was recalled from an investor roadshow yesterday; something that has worried investors. MPs on the Business committee are holding an inquiry into the Future of Work today. They\u2019ll hear from, among others, Transline - the employment agency which suppliers workers to Sports Direct, and which was axed by Amazon two weeks ago. On the corporate front, building materials group Wolseley, betting chain Ladbrokes Coral, drinks maker AG Barr and top-hat-and-tails renters Moss Bros are all reporting results. We\u2019ll be tracking all the main events through the day....",

Economist Jonathan Loynes said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>While the triggering of Article 50 is a major step along the road to Brexit, it will hardly come as a shock. Any suggestions that the UK might not actually leave the EU disappeared months ago. And the 52% of referendum voters who wanted Brexit will presumably be pleased to see the process finally commence.</p> <p>Indeed, it\u2019s perhaps more likely that the formal commencement of Brexit will give the pound another boost. If the UK government\u2019s letter announcing Article 50 contains conciliatory language, and this is echoed in the response from the EU, then hard Brexit worries could certainly dissipate somewhat further.</p> <p>If an easing of Brexit worries does raise the pound further, this will no doubt be seen by many as a positive development. But it wouldn\u2019t be unambiguously good news. After all, sterling\u2019s post-referendum depreciation has boosted exporters\u2019 order books and helped to facilitate some long-desired rebalancing of the economy.</p> <p>And, if sustained, a stronger pound could prove an awkward obstacle to the process of normalising UK monetary policy which some MPC members are keen to commence in order to ease the distortions caused by very low interest rates and provide new ammunition with which to respond to the next economic downturn.</p> <p>For now, none of this will trouble the MPC too much. After all, the pound could soon start to drop back against the US dollar at least if, as we expect, market expectations for US interest rates start to rise again. And even if it doesn\u2019t, the MPC will instinctively prefer a strongish exchange rate to a weakish one. But a further significant rise in the pound could certainly present the Committee with some difficult choices. </p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-58da7636e4b01ea2330bce59\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-03-28T14:43:38.329Z\">3.43pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>With Article 50 to be triggered on Wednesday, the pound is suffering some pre-Brexit jitters.

      "bodyText": "The Productivity Commission is proposing a major shakeup to Australia\u2019s $2tn superannuation industry that would introduce competition for employees\u2019 default superannuation funds \u2013 including those covered by enterprise bargaining agreements. The commission\u2019s draft report into the competitiveness and efficiency of Australia\u2019s superannuation system proposes four models which seek to increase competition, end workers having multiple accounts, and also reduce fees. Such a move will be highly political given it could reduce the power of the union-backed industry funds despite the commission\u2019s own research finding that such funds generally perform better than retail funds. The review into the superannuation system came out of the Murray inquiry into Australia\u2019s financial system and seeks to improve the competitiveness and efficiency of the system with a view to lowering fees. Crucially, however, the current stage of the review does not form a view on whether alternative models are better or worse than the current default arrangements, nor on the merits of the current default arrangements. The shift to a competitive process is a political one. The union-backed industry super funds are those that largely benefit from the current process which allows the default superannuation fund to be specified as part of an enterprise bargaining agreement. The commission notes that while, since 2005 workers have been able to have a choice of super funds, approximately 20% of workers covered by enterprise bargaining agreements do not have this choice. The commission also noted that around two-thirds of workers stick with the default super fund, and only around 5% switch afterwards. The commission argues that \u201cif the system is going to rely on defaults, it needs to guide members to products that at a minimum seek to maximise long-term net returns\u201d. For the commission, the path to this maximum return is through competition, and it proposes two stages. The first involves shifting from the current situation where there is a default superannuation fund for each worker when they change jobs to a \u201cfirst-timer\u201d model, where people have a default provider only when they first enter the workforce. Such workers would then \u201cretain that account (including through a change in employer) unless they actively switch\u201d. The commission estimates there are about 400,000 new workers entering the superannuation system each year worth about $800m in annual contributions \u2013 the current total default super market is worth $480bn. Such a shift would be a significant change given many people\u2019s first-time entry into the workforce is in casual or part-time employment in an industry which they do not end up staying in for most of their working life. Karen Chester, the deputy chair of the Productivity Commission, argues the process involves people\u2019s superannuation in the \u201caccumulation stage\u201d at which point they only need a \u201cpretty vanilla product\u201d. She says what such workers need is not \u201cbells and whistles\u201d \u2013 which bring with them higher fees \u2013 but \u201clow-cost, top performers\u201d with a \u201cbalanced investment strategy\u201d. Chester argues people do generally get more engaged with their super funds as they get older, but the commission\u2019s focus was on what\u2019s needed for the default member who is likely to remain disengaged. The major benefit of this move would be to reduce the number of workers who hold multiple super accounts due to having had multiple jobs \u2013 a key issue given the era of the job-for-life is long gone. Chester notes the average young worker today will have 17 different jobs during their working life, with workers under the age of 25 turning over jobs every one-and-a-half years \u2013 a situation greatly different to that which was in place when the superannuation system began 25 years ago. The report cites the Murray inquiry, which estimates that moving from an average of two-and-a-half accounts to a single account over a person\u2019s working life could increase superannuation balances by about $25,000. The commission also estimates that moving to a first-timer default model would reduce total administrative fees and insurance premiums by the order of $150m for every 500,000 to 600,000 of default accounts permanently removed from the system. The second stage of the proposed change is to implement one of four different \u201callocation models\u201d for default superannuation funds. The first is an employee choice model which would see employees choose from a list of four to 10 of the best-performing super funds (chosen by an independent government body). The shortlist would be accompanied by simple information on key features of each product in a consistent and comparable format. Employees would still be able to chose from funds not on the list, but the commission argues this process would reward the best-performing funds, force other funds to improve their performance, lower their fees to get on the list (which would be reviewed every four years), and would also encourage poor-performing funds to leave the market. The commission argues this \u201cwould make it easier and simpler for employees to choose a good product that meets their needs \u2013 especially for those who have limited financial knowledge\u201d. The second method is a similar process but one where the employer chooses funds for their employees from two lists \u2013 a mandatory light filter that ensures funds meet \u201cmandatory minimum standards\u201d that would be higher than the current standards for MySuper products; and a \u201cheavier filter\u201d which applies stricter criteria and employs higher performance benchmark hurdles. The third model is for multi-criteria tender process, similar to that proposed by the Grattan Institute. Under this system the government would require funds to compete for default fund status by making proposals against multiple assessment criteria including past performance on net returns, member satisfaction, investment strategy, fee levels and transparency and innovation in unspecified areas. Such a method is similar to that used by New Zealand to select its default superannuation providers. The final model is perhaps the most contentious as it would involve a fee-based auction process. Such a process is used in Chile, and the commission is somewhat ambivalent about the experience there. It notes that \u201cChile\u2019s experience with a fee-based auction suggests that these incentives might be limited in their effect\u201d, but it argues that because of the relatively large number of superannuation funds in Australia compared with the quite highly consolidated Chilean market, the benefits should be greater here. The commission will hold public hearings in May and finalise its report in August this year. The models will be highly political given the use of industry superannuation funds within enterprise bargaining agreements \u2013 and the desire of retail super funds to get access to that segment of the market. The report argues it is not just an issue of industry versus retail funds. It noted there was \u201cnear-universal agreement\u201d among all funds \u2013 both industry and retail against both the tender and auction models. Rather archly, the report suggested that \u201cgiven the massive flows of mandated contributions at stake\u201d, funds of all types were protecting their own interests. Industry super funds have also repeatedly noted that, under the current system, those workers in such funds have done much better than those in retail funds: Data from the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (Apra) shows that over the past 13 years, only once have retail funds delivered a higher average annual rate of return than industry super funds: The commission itself notes that the top quarter of MySuper products \u201cis dominated by industry funds\u201d. But it also found that the worst-performing quarter of funds \u201cis populated by a roughly even number of industry, retail and corporate funds\u201d. As one of the key aims of the model is to remove the lower-performing funds, however, the commission doesn\u2019t take into account whether industry is better performing than retail (or vice versa). It is mostly concerned that under the current system, workers have little knowledge of which are the better-performing funds, and that they are just as likely to be in a poor-performing fund as a well-performing one. Thus even though Apra also finds that in 2015-16 the bottom 25% of industry funds performed better than the bottom 25% of retail funds, the key for the commission is for workers to choose from the best performers: Moreover, retail funds account for a much larger slice of fees paid compared with the amount of funds they hold. The commission\u2019s proposal would see default funds being low-fee, no-frills options: Excluding self-managed funds, retail funds account for 38% of funds held in the superannuation market, but for 57% of all fees paid by superannuation members. The commission\u2019s report will inevitably be seen as a retail versus industry fight, and a political one at that. But given the on-average better performance of industry funds, it would seem to be a fight that industry funds should be up for. And given one of the biggest gripes about superannuation is the complexity \u2013 and workers having multiple accounts that are easily forgotten \u2013 the moves proposed by the commission could be quite popular.",

      "bodyText": "A financial crisis at a major nuclear energy business is threatening to deal a blow to the UK\u2019s atomic energy programme. Toshiba\u2019s US nuclear subsidiary Westinghouse Electric is believed to be on the brink of filing in the US for bankruptcy protection from creditors. A UK expert said the collapse would leave a considerable hole in Britain\u2019s new nuclear ambitions as Toshiba is a key player behind plans for a new power station at Moorside in Cumbria. Westinghouse is a behemoth in the world of nuclear vendors, with its technology in about half the world\u2019s reactors. But it is facing a writedown of billions of dollars over its acquisition of a nuclear construction and services business. In 2015 Toshiba bought CB&amp;I Stone &amp; Webster, the company managing the construction of new reactors Plant Vogtle in Georgia and Virgil C Summer in South Carolina, both of which are over budget and behind schedule. Westinghouse filing for Chapter 11 protection would potentially limit future losses for its owner Toshiba. The move will also trigger complex negotiations between the Japanese conglomerate, its American unit and creditors, and could embroil the US and Japanese governments, given the scale of the collapse and US government loan guarantees for new reactors. The US utilities that operate the two nuclear plants are among Westinghouse\u2019s biggest creditors, owed for work that has yet to be completed and potential penalties, sources have said. The bankruptcy filing will allow Westinghouse to renegotiate or break the construction contracts, although the utilities that own the projects would likely seek damages. Credit rating agency Moody\u2019s said it welcomed the prospect of bankruptcy because it could limit Toshiba\u2019s liabilities. Anti-nuclear campaigners said the episode showed the world should build renewable energy rather than new nuclear. Doug Parr, policy director at Greenpeace UK, said: \u201cThe world is watching the meltdown of a major corporation and questioning the cost of new nuclear. Declaring bankruptcy in the USA might shield Toshiba from Westinghouse\u2019s debt, but as Toshiba\u2019s share price ricochets and its multibillion-dollar losses escalate, the beleaguered nuclear industry is being shaken to the core again.\u201d Dr Paul Dorfman, a nuclear expert at UCL in London, told the Guardian: \u201cToshiba has fallen on its sword and this has significant consequences for the UK\u2019s plans for new nuclear. Kepco of South Korea may come and buy into NuGen [the consortium behind the UK\u2019s Moorside plant]. But you can\u2019t necessarily sell off the bad bits of a nuclear corporation and keep the good bits.\u201d Kecpo last week ruled out buying Westinghouse but said it was in talks to take a stake in NuGen. However, Dorfman said: \u201cWhile Kepco may wish to buy into NuGen they may find it both legally and financially problematic.\u201d He added that any unravelling of Nugen as a result of Westinghouse filing for bankruptcy would \u201cleave a considerable hole in UK nuclear plans\u201d. The AP1000 reactor design of the two US plants is the same as the three planned for the Moorside power station. Within days the UK nuclear regulator is expected to approve a \u201cgeneric design assessment\u201d for the AP1000, the end of a four-year approval process. This year Toshiba has twice delayed publishing its financial results for the third quarter of 2016, which will reveal the scale of the impairment it faces with regards to CB&amp;I Stone &amp; Webster. In January, chief executive Satoshi Tsunakawa said that while Toshiba would continue to maintain and operate its existing nuclear plants: \u201cIt is unlikely that we will carry out construction work for future nuclear power plant projects, in order to eliminate risk.\u201d But NuGen has said that while Toshiba may not build Moorside, the Japanese corporation was still committed to developing the Moorside power station. The possibility of a Westinghouse bankruptcy also raises questions over its impact on the Springfields nuclear fuel plant in Lancashire. The company owns the site on a 150-year lease from the UK government\u2019s Nuclear Decommissioning Authority. In the US, the reactors that Westinghouse is building are due to be completed within the next three years.",

      "bodyText": "For Tesco, a \u00a3235m bill to settle investigations by the Serious Fraud Office and Financial Conduct Authority counts as a tidy piece of business. The sum will wipe out almost 20% of operating profits last year, but the company\u2019s negotiating power was approximately zero after it had confessed to a \u00a3326m overstatement of profits in 2014. Assuming the deferred prosecution agreement between the SFO and Tesco Stores Ltd is approved by a judge next month, an ugly chapter for the company will close. Tesco may even be delighted that the FCA has designed a redress scheme for disgruntled investors who bought Tesco shares and bonds in the few weeks before the overstatement was corrected. An orderly process to award compensation, even one that could cost Tesco \u00a385m, sounds less messy than several rounds of legal argy-bargy. But, as one headache clears for chief executive Dave Lewis, another arrives. Two of Tesco biggest shareholders \u2013 Schroders and Artisan Partners \u2013 think the proposed \u00a33.7bn takeover of food wholesaler Booker is a stinker. They own 9% of shares between them and have called for others to join the rebellion. A public display of dissatisfaction at a large FTSE 100 company is unusual but welcome. Fund managers who do their own homework, challenge management and shout if they are unhappy should be applauded. A robust debate is much better than a quiet sale of the shares. Richard Cousins, the Tesco non-executive who resigned in protest at the Booker proposal, also deserves another honourable mention: he was paid to be independent in his views and he was. At the moment, Lewis and Tesco may feel the Competition &amp; Markets Authority, and not a pair of revolting shareholders, is the bigger obstacle to getting the Booker deal done. Let\u2019s see if life works that way in practice. One of the complaints from Schroders and Artisan is that Booker would be a big distraction from the day job of improving returns from the core UK supermarkets. For Tesco to defeat that argument, its trading will have to be near-perfect during the CMA investigation, which could take six months. Anything less than perfection will invite the charge that minds are already drifting. Booker, too, will have to sail on merrily because the takeover price isn\u2019t obviously cheap, as Schroders and Artisan point out. Tesco would be paying 23 times earnings for a company that has been radically improved over the past half-decade but may have reached top speed. Yes, \u00a3200m of annual savings are up for grabs, the companies estimate, but 23 times earnings is still an almighty rating for a food distribution business. Lewis\u2019 pitch, in essence, is \u201ctrust me, I know what I\u2019m doing\u201d. Few would doubt his regime has restored Tesco\u2019s competitiveness, but it hasn\u2019t yet delivered for shareholders. The share price is still below 200p, as it was in 2014, and the restoration of a dividend \u2013 due this year \u2013 is merely happening on time, rather than ahead of schedule. It wouldn\u2019t take much for the Schroders/Artisan arguments to gain ground. If only 9% of the troops are restless, the board can probably afford to ignore them. Yet colossal majorities are the norm in agreed takeover deals: at 20% resistance, Tesco and Lewis would be in trouble. This scrap has a long way to run. Weighing up the odds for Ladbrokes Coral \u201cThe year ended with a sharp reminder that nervous times are never far away,\u201d said Jim Mullen, chief executive of newly merged Ladbrokes Coral. Apparently, it was only a home defeat for Newcastle United to Sheffield Wednesday on Boxing Day that saved the bookies from a \u201cblack swan\u201d event on accumulators and multiple bets. But Mullen could equally have been referring to the government\u2019s review of fixed odds betting terminals (FOBTs), announced at the end of October. Quite how much is at stake for Lad Coral was underlined in the maiden set of combined figures: net revenue from machines was \u00a3802m in 2016, or 56% of the total from 3,500 shops. Not all that revenue would disappear if the government reduced maximum stakes from \u00a3100 to \u00a32, but City estimates of the financial damage (for the bookies, not the mugs playing electronic roulette, obviously) range from bad to calamitous. Lad Coral could be looking at a \u00a3100m hit to top-line profits. If one can ignore that risk, the company\u2019s early form is promising. Mullen reckons he can find another \u00a335m of merger savings, on top of the original \u00a365m. Operating profits rose 22% to \u00a3264m last year, even if the bottom-line figure was a huge loss after one-offs and impairment charges. Take your pick: for ex-Ladbrokes investors, prospects look brighter than they have for years. Alternatively, the government could crush the optimism at a stroke. Still, those odds beat roulette.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "BrewDog threatened legal action to prevent a bar from using the term \u201cpunk\u201d in its name, it has emerged, a day after the brewer blamed \u201ctrigger-happy\u201d lawyers for a similar dispute that sparked a social media backlash. The brewer, which has been a vocal critic of the behaviour of large corporations, raised an objection to plans by music promoter Tony Green to open a bar in Leeds called Draft Punk. Green, who says the name was a tongue-in-cheek reference to French dance music act Daft Punk, said the \u201cintimidating\u201d threat contravened the punk movement spirit that BrewDog claims to espouse. \u201cThey can\u2019t own punk, that\u2019s the whole point,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s inherited, it\u2019s British culture.\u201d In the letter, seen by the Guardian, BrewDog warned that it had a \u201cwell-established beer under the name of punk\u201d, a reference to its Punk IPA beer, which it has been brewing since 2007. The brewer also raised money under its \u201cEquity for Punks\u201d scheme. Although BrewDog owns the \u201cpunk\u201d trademark in relation to beer only, rather than pubs or bars, it said the fact that the bar planned to serve beer meant its trademark rights would be infringed. Law firm Lawrie IP, representing BrewDog, wrote: \u201cOur client is very concerned that provision of food and drink services under the mark Draft Punk would give rise to a likelihood of confusion in the marketplace, including a likelihood of association with our client\u2019s earlier mark Punk.\u201d The letter, sent in December last year, also said the bar would \u201ctake unfair advantage of, or be detrimental to\u201d BrewDog\u2019s own punk-related products and demanded the bar withdraw its application to use the title Draft Punk. The dispute emerged just a day after BrewDog blamed \u201ctrigger-happy\u201d lawyers for sending legal threats to a brother-and-sister duo who wanted to open a pub called the Lone Wolf. BrewDog forced the pub pair to change the venue\u2019s name \u2013 to the Wolf \u2013 but founder and chief executive James Watt has since backed down after a social media backlash that saw the company labelled \u201cjust another multinational corporate machine\u201d. However, the pub\u2019s owners have decided to stick with the site\u2019s new name, despite BrewDog\u2019s retreat. Green, who eventually abandoned his plan to open a bar, said he was disappointed by the company\u2019s attitude and had been unable to fight back due to a lack of funds. \u201cWhen we got the letter from them we were a bit gutted. We can see why they sent it but we replied and said it was nothing to do with their beer,\u201d he said. He and his business partner had spent about \u00a34,000 on PR advice and making drafts of a logo, he said. \u201cWe asked how they were going to compensate us and they just said we had to cease and desist or they\u2019d take us to court. After all of it, I just thought whatever, we can think of another name. But how dare you own that word, you can\u2019t have it. You\u2019ll get no sob story from us but they were just nasty and heavy-handed from start to finish.\u201d BrewDog did not return requests for comment.",

The brewer also raised money under its \u201cEquity for Punks\u201d scheme.</p> <p>Although BrewDog owns the \u201cpunk\u201d trademark in relation to beer only, rather than pubs or bars, it said the fact that the bar planned to serve beer meant its trademark rights would be infringed.</p> <p>Law firm Lawrie IP, representing BrewDog, wrote: \u201cOur client is very concerned that provision of food and drink services under the mark Draft Punk would give rise to a likelihood of confusion in the marketplace, including a likelihood of association with our client\u2019s earlier mark Punk.\u201d</p> <p>The letter, sent in December last year, also said the bar would \u201ctake unfair advantage of, or be detrimental to\u201d BrewDog\u2019s own punk-related products and demanded the bar withdraw its application to use the title Draft Punk.</p> <p>The dispute emerged just a day after BrewDog blamed \u201ctrigger-happy\u201d lawyers for sending legal threats to a brother-and-sister duo who wanted to open a pub called the Lone Wolf. BrewDog forced the pub pair to change the venue\u2019s name \u2013 to the Wolf \u2013 but founder and chief executive James Watt has since backed down after a social media backlash that saw the company <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/mar/26/brewdog-lone-wolf-birmingham-pub-change-name\">labelled \u201cjust another multinational corporate machine\u201d</a>. However, the pub\u2019s owners have decided to stick with the site\u2019s new name, despite BrewDog\u2019s retreat.</p> <p>Green, who eventually abandoned his plan to open a bar, said he was disappointed by the company\u2019s attitude and had been unable to fight back due to a lack of funds.</p> <p>\u201cWhen we got the letter from them we were a bit gutted. We can see why they sent it but we replied and said it was nothing to do with their beer,\u201d he said.</p> <p>He and his business partner had spent about \u00a34,000 on PR advice and making drafts of a logo, he said.</p> <p>\u201cWe asked how they were going to compensate us and they just said we had to cease and desist or they\u2019d take us to court. After all of it, I just thought whatever, we can think of another name. But how dare you own that word, you can\u2019t have it. You\u2019ll get no sob story from us but they were just nasty and heavy-handed from start to finish.\u201d</p> <p>BrewDog did not return requests for comment.</p>",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Scores of Sports Direct workers who were found to have been paid less than the minimum wage are yet to receive the back pay owed for their shifts. Steve Turner, the assistant general secretary of the Unite union, told MPs on the business, energy and industrial strategy (BEIS) select committee on Tuesday that Transline, one of the employment agencies exposed during an undercover Guardian investigation, had refused to honour part of the deal. The agency was part of an agreement last August to award workers about \u00a31m in back pay after it was revealed that Sports Direct workers were being paid less than the legal minimum. The payments were to be backdated to May 2012 and could be worth up to \u00a31,000 for some workers, union officials estimated at the time, although they expressed concern that Transline would refuse to refund unpaid wages from before it took over contracts from a rival agency, Blue Arrow, in 2014. Turner told MPs: \u201cTransline have refused to pay the back payment for the non-payment of national minimum wage for the period of employment that employees had before Transline took over the contract. So they are refusing to honour the transfer of undertakings regulations [commonly referred to as Tupe]. \u201cThis is a huge issue. This is hundreds and hundreds of pounds for thousands of workers, where Best Connection, the other agency, has honoured the agreement and paid in full. Sports Direct has paid in full. But one agency, Transline, has decided it\u2019s not going to do that.\u201d A Transline spokesperson said: \u201cAll back payments have been made to Transline employees over the period in question [2014-2016]. For those employees that worked for Blue Arrow and then transferred to Transline, we have been working with HM Revenue &amp; Customs and are awaiting their guidance on how Tupe applies to the period that those employees worked for Blue Arrow. We will act according to their feedback as soon as this is received.\u201d Blue Arrow declined to comment. The hearings were part of the BEIS committee inquiry into the future world of work, with two sessions on Tuesday specifically looking at temporary employment agencies and their workers. While the committee heard evidence of how agencies can benefit workers and employees, particularly at times of high demand, such as Christmas, there were witnesses from within the employment agency industry who voiced damning criticisms of the sector. David Camp, the chief executive of the Association of Labour Providers, said some operatives were \u201ccriminal\u201d or \u201cdodgy\u201d. \u201cWe rank agencies into four categories. Criminal: those who pay significantly below the minimum wage and there are many indicators of forced labour in the way they operate. Dodgy: those who seek to minimise their costs at all levels by underpaying holiday, not paying SSP [statutory sick pay], opt[ing] out of personal accident insurance schemes and so on,\u201d he said. \u201cCompliant: those businesses that seek to comply with the law. And leading: those that comply with the law, have respect for their workers and aim to introduce good practice throughout.\u201d Camp declined to expand on how much of the industry fell into each category. However, written evidence sent to the inquiry by one agency chief executive suggested poor practices are common. A submission by Adrian Gregory, the director of London-based recruitment agency Extraman and a campaigner against abuses within the industry, said: \u201cHaving spent 30 years in the business, I would \u2026 suggest that my particular part of the recruitment industry, that dealing with unskilled industrial staff, currently operates with little regard for the law and none whatever for any ethical considerations. \u201cA pernicious cocktail of inadequate, impractical and muddled legislation combined with a complete disregard for the rights and welfare of the very people, the temporary staff, who earn agencies their money has led to mass exploitation coupled with huge tax avoidance.\u201d The committee also heard how Transline supplies workers to retailers including Argos and Asos, both of which have been criticised over their alleged working practices. Transline wrote to the BEIS committee last September saying it had undertaken a full review to make sure its \u201coperations are fully compliant\u201d.",

      "bodyText": "Redrow has walked away from buying Bovis Homes after deciding not to increase its takeover approach, clearing the field for rival housebuilder Galliford Try. Bovis, which is under pressure following severe criticism over the quality of its homes, a shock profit warning and the departure of its chief executive, confirmed on 12 March that it had received takeover approaches from Redrow and Galliford. The company said at the time that its board had decided to reject both offers because \u201cneither reflected the underlying value of the Bovis business\u201d. Talks with Redrow, which proposed a cash and share deal, were terminated, while discussions with Galliford, which proposed an all-share merger at 886p a share, carried on. Bovis\u2019s share price has struggled since the Brexit vote last June. Other housebuilders have recovered more quickly. Its shares fell 1.6% to 859p in early trading on Tuesday after Redrow put out a statement saying: \u201cFollowing additional analysis, the board of Redrow has determined that it is not in its shareholders\u2019 best interests to increase its proposal to Bovis above the level that was rejected by the board of Bovis. Given this, Redrow confirms that it does not intend to make an offer for Bovis.\u201d Galliford has argued that its housebuilding division, Linden Homes, would complement Bovis and give the combined company a strong presence in the south of England. Galliford also has a regeneration arm and a construction business that installed the retractable roof over Centre Court at Wimbledon. Bovis has had a difficult few months and will spend \u00a37m on repairing poorly built homes, after angry customers set up a Facebook group and accused the company of pressuring them to move in to unfinished homes so it could hit sales targets. The interim chief executive Earl Sibley, who took the helm after David Ritchie left in January, has put the brakes on the company\u2019s production rates.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Tesco is to pay out \u00a3235m to settle investigations by the Serious Fraud Office and Financial Conduct Authority into the 2014 accounting scandal that rocked Britain\u2019s biggest retailer. It will pay a fine of \u00a3129m as part of a deferred prosecution agreement (DPA) with the SFO, although this deal requires court approval. The DPA relates to Tesco subsidiary Tesco Stores Ltd. The supermarket group has separately agreed with the FCA to pay about \u00a385m in compensation to investors affected by a trading statement on 29 August 2014 that overstated profits. Tesco will also pay legal costs associated with the agreements and said the total exceptional charge was expected to be \u00a3235m. Dave Lewis, the chief executive of Tesco, said the settlement allowed the company to move on. \u201cI want to apologise to all those affected. What happened is a huge source of regret to us all at Tesco, but we are a different business now,\u201d he said. He admitted the Tesco brand had been damaged by the disclosure of the accounting scandal, but said the company was \u201ccommitted to doing everything we can to continue to restore trust in our business and brand\u201d. Lewis said it had been a very difficult period for Tesco, but he was \u201cproud that we faced into it. We have undertaken a comprehensive programme of change.\u201d A small team at Tesco has been dedicated to working on resolving the accounting issue and cooperating with the investigations. Lewis took charge of Tesco in September 2014. The proposed DPA relates to false accounting at Tesco Stores Limited, a subsidiary of the retailer, between February and September 2014. The settlements relate to Tesco admitting in 2014 that it had overstated profits by \u00a3326m. This overstatement was linked to how it booked payments from suppliers. The agreements between Tesco, the SFO and FCA are not an admittance by the company that it or any of its employees committed a criminal offence. The FCA has stated in a ruling that it is not suggesting the Tesco board of directors knew, or could reasonably be expected to have known, that the information in the company\u2019s trading statement in August 2014 was false or misleading. The compensation agreement with the FCA involves paying out to investors who bought shares or bonds between 29 August and 19 September 2014. Each purchaser of shares during this period will receive 24.5p a share plus interest at 1.25% a year for institutional investors, or 4% a year for retail investors. Auditor KPMG has been appointed to administer the compensation scheme with oversight from the FCA, which has not imposed a penalty on Tesco. The company said it had fully cooperated with the SFO and FCA investigations and undertaken an \u201cextensive programme of change\u201d that involved overhauling leadership, structures, financial controls, partnerships with suppliers, and the way the business buys and sells. DPAs, which were introduced in the UK in February 2014, allow a company to suspend a prosecution in return for meeting specified conditions, such as paying a fine and demonstrating that its culture has changed. The agreements, which have been used in the US for years, require judicial approval. Tesco\u2019s case is scheduled to be heard on 10 April. The DPA with Tesco follows a settlement with Rolls-Royce in January that saw the aerospace and defence company agree to pay \u00a3671m over allegations that it bribed middlemen around the world between 1989 and 2013. In a statement, the SFO confirmed the agreement with Tesco, but said it would make no further comment until the court hearing. Bruno Monteyne, an analyst at Bernstein, said: \u201cTesco has now settled three out of the four challenges [relating to the scandal] \u2013 US investors, the SFO and the FCA. \u201cThat leaves one more issue from the past to be dealt with: possible lawsuits by European-based investors. There is no progress on that. There are occasional reports about groups of investors filing a claim, but clearly not enough in their cases to make any real progress. \u201cThe short period of time covered by both the SFO ruling and the FCA ruling seems to imply very limited opportunity for these cases to extract large compensation.\u201d Laith Khalaf, a senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: \u201cThis kind of accounting error is exceptionally rare in the UK stock market. Nonetheless, shareholders in all companies will be heartened to learn that in instances where false information is provided to the market, the regulator will see to it that investors are duly compensated.\u201d Tesco\u2019s \u00a385m payout to investors About 10,000 investors in Tesco will share \u00a385m in compensation agreed with the financial markets watchdog. It is the first time the FCA has used its powers to require a listed company to pay compensation for market abuse after the supermarket admitted issuing a misleading statement of its affairs in 2014. The majority of those being offered compensation are individual retail investors, some of whom hold just a handful of shares. To qualify, investors must have bought Tesco shares or bonds between 29 August 2014 and 19 September 2014. In order to receive compensation shareholders must also be a \u201cnet investor\u201d having bought more shares than they sold during that period. They must have also suffered a financial loss. Any loss automatically offset by a hedging agreement, for example, would not qualify. Each qualifying shareholder will receive 24.5p per share while compensation for bondholders varies depending on the investment they made. Interest on compensation will also be paid at a rate of 4% from 19 September until 120 days after the scheme commences later this year for individual investors. Institutional investors will get a rate of 1.25%. The scheme will be operated by accountancy firm KPMG which expects to complete preparations to begin operation by the end of August.",
