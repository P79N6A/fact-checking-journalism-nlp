      "bodyText": "Fresh evidence of the impact of the post-Brexit depreciation in the value of the pound will be revealed on Tuesday with the release of the latest set of official inflation figures. City analysts believe there will have been a pause in June in the steady increase in the cost of living to 2.9% in the 12 months since the EU referendum, but most believe the respite will prove temporary. And with annual earnings growth at 2%, the release of the latest inflation data from the Office for National Statistics is likely to prompt renewed speculation about a slowdown in consumer demand caused by prices rising faster than wages. Inflation was running at 0.6% when the UK voted to leave the EU in June 2016 but it has risen subsequently as a result of higher oil prices and dearer imports caused by the 12% decline in the value of the pound over the past 12 months. That has taken the annual inflation rate to its highest level in four years and close to the level where Mark Carney, the governor of the Bank of England, would be forced to write a letter to the chancellor, Philip Hammond, explaining why Threadneedle Street had failed to keep the annual increase in the cost of living to within one percentage point of the government\u2019s 2% target. Consumer spending helped keep the economy expanding strongly in the six months after the Brexit vote, but the growth rate slipped to 0.2% in the first three months of 2017. Samuel Tombs, a UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said inflation was likely to peak at 3.2% later in the year even though the July figure would show no change. Tombs said the recent fall in global oil prices would help motorists by reducing the cost of motoring, while smaller increases in air fares, and toys and games in June 2017 than in the same month a year earlier would also dampen inflationary pressure. \u201cFood inflation, however, is continuing to grind higher in response to sterling\u2019s collapse,\u201d Tombs said. Victoria Clarke, UK analyst at Investec, said the impact of air fares was likely to shave 0.1 points off the annual inflation rate to 2.8%, but said this did not mark a turning point. \u201cWe actually see inflation climbing a touch further to 3% later this summer and holding around that level until year end.\u201d But Ruth Gregory, UK economist at Capital Economics, said the squeeze on consumers would be nowhere near as pronounced or as prolonged as it was after sterling\u2019s last major depreciation in 2008. \u201cWith the effects of the lower pound appearing to be fading at the start of the production line, CPI inflation looks to have almost peaked already and we think that it will gradually start to head down towards the 2% target from next year,\u201d she said. \u201cMeanwhile, there are reasons to think that nominal wage growth should start to pick up in the quarters ahead, as higher inflation makes it more difficult for employers to award lower wage rises, a gradual pick-up in productivity growth improves firms\u2019 ability to grant larger pay increases and the past tightening in the labour market leads to at least some strengthening in pay growth.\u201d",

The high street chain is recalling three colours \u2013 black, blue and khaki \u2013 from its men\u2019s Cedar Wood State flip-flop range and offering customers a full refund. A statement on the company\u2019s website said: \u201cIt has come to our attention that the footwear product detailed above does not meet the Primark usual high standards for chemical compliance. \u201cWe have found levels of a restricted substance in the product in excess of the 1.0 mg/kg requirement.\u201d A Primark spokesman told the Guardian the chemical in question was chrysene, which is a regulated chemical commonly used in dark coloured dyes. Chrysene has been found to have a carcinogenic risk to humans and can cause cancer, reports Science Direct. However, a Primark spokesman said: \u201cAt the levels found in the flip-flop, we believe the health and safety risk to customers is minimal.\u201d The shoes were taken off the shelves on 2 June after being on sale since January. The problem was discovered by Primark when it followed up an inquiry by a third party, it has been reported. The company has suspended any outstanding orders from the factory which makes the flip-flops and an investigation has been launched. The spokesman said: \u201cWe take the safety of our customers, and the quality of our products, very seriously, which is why we have chosen to recall three men\u2019s flip-flops from our Cedar Wood State range. \u201cAll new orders with this factory have been suspended while we carry out a thorough investigation. A full refund is being offered to all customers.\u201d It is the third product recall Primark has issued this year. Earlier this year, Primark had to recall pairs of children\u2019s leggings emblazoned with cats after it was discovered that small pink bows on the knees posed a potential choking hazard. In February, the company pulled a range of The Walking Dead T-shirts from its stores after complaints of racism from customers. The serial numbers of affected flip-flops are: Black 02387/01, 02, 03.

      "bodyText": "I welcome your editorial and related coverage (Stop the spread of the tobacco companies\u2019 poison, 13 July). Tobacco smoking is still the largest single preventable cause of ill-health and death. In the UK the reduction in smoking is one of the great public health success stories. However, it is important that this achievement is not reversed. E-cigarettes should be monitored closely. Tobacco companies have tremendous financial and political power and, despite the overwhelming medical evidence against cigarettes, they are still able to sell their products. Moreover, certain markets are expanding. Two of the world\u2019s largest tobacco companies are based in the UK. Both continue to perform strongly and are confident about their future performances, especially as markets are growing in lower income countries where there is tremendous potential for profit. Many of the current strategies used by tobacco companies are not new. More than 30 years ago, Peter Taylor published a seminal book which provided a comprehensive insight into the world of public health politics. The Smoke Ring discusses the ring of political and economic interests surrounding the tobacco industry. Dr Michael Craig Watson University of Nottingham \u2022 We are concerned, if not surprised, to read the Guardian\u2019s expos\u00e9 of big tobacco\u2019s use of trade measures to threaten African countries into watering down their efforts to promote public health (Report, 12 July). A major problem with trade and investment agreements is their chilling effect on public interest legislation: countries that lack the time or resources to defend themselves against a trade dispute hold back from introducing new measures that are good for the public but threaten corporate profits and could provoke a trade challenge. This is particularly problematic where corporations are able to use the investor-state dispute settlement mechanism to sue governments in private tribunals where corporate lawyers act as judges. For example, after Philip Morris challenged Uruguay and Australia for introducing graphic warnings on cigarette packaging and plain packaging respectively, Costa Rica, Paraguay and New Zealand delayed introducing similar measures. Philip Morris lost that case, but big tobacco is still attempting to bully (particularly low and middle income) countries that attempt to put the health of their citizens before shareholder profit. This has to be stopped. Countries must be free to pursue independent development and public health strategies. That means having the space to regulate and tax in the public interest without the threat of litigation. We would like to see trade agreements that encourage governments to promote public health objectives, rather than acting as a brake on progress. This requires a fundamental shift in the way that we approach trade deals in the future. Matthew Bramall Health Poverty Action Paul Keenlyside Trade Justice Movement David McCoy Professor of Global Public Health, Queen Mary University London Dr Penelope Milsom Medact Deowan Mohee African Tobacco Control Alliance Alvin Mosioma Tax Justice Network \u2013 Africa Mary Assunta South East Asia Tobacco Control Alliance Deborah Arnott ASH (UK) Laurent Huber Action on Smoking and Health (US) Chiara Bodini and David Sanders People\u2019s Health Movement Andreas Wulf Medico International Jean Blaylock Global Justice Now Mark Dearn War on Want Tabitha Ha STOPAIDS Thanguy Nzue Obame People\u2019s Health Movement Gabon \u2022 That big tobacco hinders the adoption of anti-smoking legislation is no surprise. Your leader correctly identifies the best route to behavioural change \u2013 shareholder pressure \u2013 but does not highlight the key channel to achieve this. Big tobacco needs to diversify. This is where shareholder pressure should be applied: to encourage manufacturers and associated leaf merchants to invest in non-harmful products and speed up the process of product diversification. In addition, governments in the south and their development partners should work with manufacturers and merchants to reduce big tobacco\u2019s own addiction to the evil weed. Dr Martin Prowse Lund University, Sweden \u2022 It is a proud claim we make in this country that 0.7% of our GDP is committed to international development. But efforts to reduce poverty and ill health in developing countries are seriously undermined by the activities of companies such as British American Tobacco. The tobacco industry has an unrivalled record for dishonesty in trying to prevent its customers becoming aware that there is a 50% chance that they will die from smoking-related causes. It has been a long battle in this country to establish strong measures of tobacco control which have significantly reduced the prevalence of smoking. In response, the tobacco companies are seeking to get many more people in the developing world addicted to their products. They use the same bogus arguments that have been defeated in the UK to prevent attempts by governments in those countries to prevent this happening. They behave in this way because they make great profits. The world would be a much better place if such dangerous products were banned. But if this cannot be done by international agreement, then we must at least ensure that we tax them in such a way as to deter such behaviour. The funds raised could also help poorer countries in their fight to establish similar measures of tobacco control to those that are working in the UK. Chris Rennard Liberal Democrat, House of Lords \u2022 It is deeply unethical that BAT has taken African countries to court to dilute their efforts to protect their populations\u2019 health from tobacco. These countries are still fighting infectious diseases and face a double burden of poor health as a result of non-communicable diseases, with very limited budgets to deal with these. According to the international covenant on economic, social and cultural rights in the context of business activities (June 2017), these countries are obliged to protect their public\u2019s health, and this includes regulating to restrict marketing and advertising of harmful products such as tobacco. BAT is headquartered in the UK, so the UK is required to take the necessary steps to prevent human rights violations abroad and it is \u201ccontradictory to remain passive where the conduct of an entity may lead to foreseeable harm\u201d. Moreover, \u201cextraterritorial obligation to protect requires the UK to take steps to prevent and redress infringements of rights that occur outside their territories due to the activities of business entities over which they can exercise control.\u201d If the UK does not fulfil its extraterritorial responsibility to protect future smokers in Africa, it is possible that it could be liable for damages when many develop cancer, heart disease and strokes. It is incoherent to give British aid for healthcare to these countries while at the same time a UK company is promoting harmful products that diminish people\u2019s right to health. On a related subject, British MP pension fund, the Parliamentary Contributory Pension Fund (PCPF), invests in BAT and some UK local authority pensions invest large sums in the tobacco industry which many already consider unethical even before the article in the Guardian. Dr Bernadette O\u2019Hare University of Malawi and University of St Andrews \u2022 Smoking remains a major public health concern, a major contributor to overall mortality and morbidity, to air and water pollution and to physical, economic, social and psychological trauma. However, I must take issue with your allusion to the size of the distance from the developed to the developing world. The Grenfell tragedy has shone a light on the ills of western societies where people are denied their fundamental rights to safe, clean and adequate housing; where hundreds of thousands are languishing in cramped and dangerous buildings; where homelessness, labour exploitation, knife crimes, racial and religious intolerance and joblessness are increasingly becoming hallmarks of society \u2013 and where cover up and deceit are becoming the norm rather than the exception. To be fair, many developing countries have already recovered from the ills that still plague the developed world. Take a look in the mirror.

Your leader correctly identifies the best route to behavioural change \u2013 shareholder pressure \u2013 but does not highlight the key channel to achieve this. Big tobacco needs to diversify. This&#xa0;is where shareholder pressure should be applied: to encourage manufacturers and associated leaf merchants to invest in non-harmful products and speed up the process of product diversification. In&#xa0;addition, governments in the south and their development partners should work with manufacturers and merchants to reduce big tobacco\u2019s own addiction to the evil weed.<br><strong>Dr Martin Prowse</strong><br><em>Lund University, Sweden</em></p> <p>\u2022 It is a proud claim we make in this country that 0.7% of our GDP is committed to international development. But&#xa0;efforts to reduce poverty and ill health in developing countries are seriously undermined by the activities of companies such as British American Tobacco.</p> <p>The tobacco industry has an unrivalled record for dishonesty in trying to prevent its customers becoming aware that there is a 50% chance that they will die from smoking-related causes. It has been a long battle in this country to establish strong measures of tobacco control which have significantly reduced the prevalence of smoking.</p> <p>In response, the tobacco companies are seeking to get many more people in the developing world addicted to their products. They use the same bogus arguments that have been defeated in the UK to prevent attempts by governments in those countries to prevent this happening. They behave in this way because they make great profits.</p> <p>The world would be a much better place if such dangerous products were banned. But if this cannot be done by international agreement, then we must at least ensure that we tax them in such a way as to deter such behaviour. The funds raised could also help poorer countries in their fight to establish similar measures of tobacco control to those that are working in the UK.<br><strong>Chris Rennard</strong><br><em>Liberal Democrat, House of Lords</em></p> <p>\u2022 It is deeply unethical that BAT has taken African countries to court to dilute their efforts to protect their populations\u2019 health from tobacco. These&#xa0;countries are still fighting infectious diseases and face a double burden of poor health as a result of non-communicable diseases, with very limited budgets to deal with&#xa0;these.</p> <p>According to the international covenant on economic, social and cultural rights in the context of business activities (June 2017), these countries are obliged to protect their public\u2019s health, and this includes regulating to restrict marketing and advertising of harmful products such as tobacco.</p> <p>BAT is headquartered in the UK, so the UK is required to take the necessary steps to prevent human rights violations abroad and it is \u201ccontradictory to remain passive where the&#xa0;conduct of an entity may lead to foreseeable harm\u201d.</p> <p>Moreover, \u201cextraterritorial obligation to protect requires the UK to take steps to prevent and redress infringements of rights that occur outside their territories due to the activities of business entities over which they can exercise control.\u201d</p> <p>If the UK does not fulfil its extraterritorial responsibility to protect future smokers in Africa, it is possible that it could be liable for damages when many develop cancer, heart disease and strokes. It is incoherent to give British aid for healthcare to these countries while at the same time a UK company is promoting harmful products that diminish people\u2019s right to health.</p> <p>On a related subject, British MP pension fund, the Parliamentary Contributory Pension Fund (PCPF), invests in BAT and some UK local authority pensions invest large sums in the tobacco industry which many already consider unethical even before the article in the Guardian.<br><strong>Dr Bernadette O\u2019Hare</strong><br><em>University of Malawi and University of&#xa0;St&#xa0;Andrews</em></p> <p>\u2022 Smoking remains a major public health concern, a major contributor to overall mortality and morbidity, to air and water pollution and to physical, economic, social and psychological trauma. However, I must take issue with&#xa0;your allusion to the size of the distance from the developed to the developing world.</p> <p>The Grenfell tragedy has shone a light on the ills of western societies where people are denied their fundamental rights to safe, clean and adequate housing; where hundreds of thousands are languishing in cramped and dangerous buildings; where homelessness, labour exploitation, knife crimes, racial and religious intolerance and joblessness are increasingly becoming hallmarks of society \u2013 and where cover up and deceit are becoming the norm rather than the&#xa0;exception.</p> <p>To be fair, many developing countries have already recovered from the ills that still plague the developed world.

      "bodyText": "Stronger than expected economic growth from China set a positive note initially for investors. But there was still some caution ahead of a busy week for US company results, while weak US manufacturing figures added to the expectation that the Federal Reserve would hold back on further rate rises. So in all it was a mixed performance. Most European markets dipped back, but the Chinese data helped lift commodity prices and in turn mining shares, which pushed the FTSE 100 higher. David Madden, market analyst at CMC Markets UK, said: European equity markets are mixed today, but London\u2019s large exposure to commodity related companies has given it the edge over its eurozone counterparts. The better-than-expected growth numbers from China boosted the share price of Rio Tinto, Glencore, Anglo American and BHP Billiton. The second-largest economy in the world is easily on target to achieve its 2017 growth target of 6.5%, as it grew by 6.9% in the first quarter and second quarter. Meanwhile the MSCI World Index has reached a new record, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average has shrugged off early losses to edge higher, after hitting another intra day peak on Friday. The final scores in Europe showed: The FTSE 100 finished 25.74 points or 0.35% higher at 7404.13 Germany\u2019s Dax dipped 0.35% to 12,587.16 France\u2019s Cac closed 0.1% lower at 5230.17 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB fell 0.03% to 21,484.84 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended down 0.04% to 10,651.2 In Greece, the Athens market added 0.19% to 858.08 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up around 15 points or 0.07%. On that note, it\u2019s time to close for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. It\u2019s probably no surprise that US markets are drifting a little, since it\u2019s the start of a busy week for company results. The economic reform plans of French president Emmanuel Macron have received a positive reception from the International Monetary Fund. In its latest statement after a staff visit to the county the IMF said: The government\u2019s ambitious reform program could go a long way in addressing France\u2019s longstanding economic challenges\u2014persistent fiscal imbalances, high unemployment, and weak external competitiveness. The emphasis on reducing public spending, to allow gradual fiscal consolidation and tax relief, is appropriate. To make the strategy credible, deep reforms are needed at all levels of government, with major spending efforts from the start. The labor market strategy is broad and ambitious\u2014it would enhance enterprise-level flexibility, reform unemployment insurance, and improve professional training and apprenticeship systems. It should be complemented by continued wage moderation. The planned corporate, capital, and labor tax reforms should boost investment and job growth. To maximize the impact, the package should include measures to reduce the corporate tax debt bias, remove inefficient exemptions, address disincentives to company growth, and streamline the taxation of long-term savings. The full report is here. Gold is moving higher, with the dollar weakening as the idea of another rate rise from the US Federal Reserve continues to fade. It has added $6 an ounce to $1234, while silver is also higher, up from $15.99 to $16.17. Meanwhile with the New York manufacturing data the latest to hit the dollar, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is now in negative territory. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said: Following a far worse than forecast Empire State manufacturing index reading, falling from 19.8 to 9.8 month-on-month, there wasn\u2019t much reason for the Dow Jones to build on its recent highs this Monday...In general the week is a bit light on Grade A data from the US, meaning the Dow\u2019s movements may end up being dictated by its reporting companies rather than any rate hike chatter. In the Eurozone the DAX and CAC spent the day flitting from red to green and back again...The FTSE remained far and away Monday\u2019s best performer, even if it fell from its midday peak. The UK index is up 50 points, and is just about keeping its head above 7400, thanks to the dual boosts of some China-inspired gains in the commodity sector and a Brexit-dragged showing from sterling, which is down between 0.1-0.2% against the dollar and the euro. The pound is set to jump back into the spotlight tomorrow morning with the release of the latest inflation reading. Analysts are expecting the figure to remain unchanged at a still eye-watering 2.9%, though it\u2019s worth noting that the number has outperformed forecasts for the last 4 months in a row. After facing the public in Birmingham last year to try and explain its role and its actions to boost the economy, the Bank of England is venturing out again, this time to Liverpool. On 16 November, governor Mark Carney and his team will be holding the latest Future Forum, including discussing how the Bank has been trying to make its work more accessible. The Bank said: We\u2019ll be talking about economics and the economy and explaining to people how the financial world affects their lives. We\u2019ll also be discussing what the Bank can do to raise public understanding of its role in the economy...This year, more than ever, the emphasis is on communications \u2013 that is, the exchange of ideas. We want to have a real two-way conversation with the wider public, hearing from those whose lives are influenced by the Bank\u2019s policies, listening, just as much as speaking. Last year there was certainly an exchange of ideas, given the meeting followed the Bank\u2019s decision to cut interest rates in the immediate aftermath of the Brexit vote. Carney found himself on the defensive after Theresa May suggested at the Tory party conference that it was only the rich that benefitted from low interest rates and the Bank\u2019s money printing policy. Carney said he was not going to \u201ctake instruction on our policies from the political side.\u201d The full story is here: The MSCI world index may have hit a new high but elsewhere the picture is not quite as clear cut. On Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average - which touched a new peak during Friday\u2019s session - is virtually flat, up just 2 points ahead of a a big weak for US earnings. The S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq Composite were also marginally higher. Elsewhere the FTSE 100 is currently up 28 points or 0.39% while Germany\u2019s Dax and France\u2019s Cac are both slightly down on the day. Over in the US, and there have been some poor manufacturing figures from New York. The Empire State manufacturing index dropped from 19.8 to 9.8 in July, missing expectations of a smaller decline to 15. The news saw the dollar slip slightly, with the data adding to the idea that the US Federal Reserve may hold fire on further interest rate rises. Last week Fed chair Janet Yellen gave what was interpreted as a fairly dovish testimony to the Senate. Ahead of the Empire figures, Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK, said: An unexpectedly cautious testimony from Fed chief Janet Yellen to US lawmakers, as well as some disappointing economic data on the part of the US consumer and some more weak inflation data appears to raising doubts about the pace of future US rate rises. Back with the Chinese growth figures and the financial oversight news. Sean Yokota, head of Asia strategy at Nordic bank SEB, said: China\u2019s second quarter 2017 GDP remained elevated at 6.9% year-on-year and beat the market\u2019s expectations of 6.8%. June monthly indicators, such as industrial production and retails sales, are also showing strength. Monetary tightening has helped slow the domestic economy but the upside in Q2 2017 GDP came from stronger external demand. Due to stronger than expected growth in the first half of this year, we have revised up our 2017 GDP forecast to 6.8% from 6.7%. We still expect a mild slowdown in H2 2017. Over the weekend President Xi of China announced the creation of a super regulator called the Financial Stability and Development Committee (FSDC). This move clearly shows that the government and President Xi see the increasing risk from financial market instability as a priority. The contagion risk bleeding from financial market risk to political risk has grown to a point where President Xi needs to monitor this at the State Council level. Another implication is that financial market development will slow as when authorities are focused on risk, the market becomes more conservative and liberalisation slows. The other news out of China today is that Winnie the Pooh has seemingly fallen foul of the country\u2019s internet censors. The much-loved, tubby bear can no longer be discussed on Chinese social media sites, apparently as part of a new crackdown by Beijing. But it\u2019s not all bad for Pooh; he has been given a prime position on the front page of the Financial Times, which says: Posts including the Chinese name of the fictional bear were censored on Sina Weibo, ChinaTwitter-like platform, over the weekend, while a collection of animated gifs featuring the bear were removed from social messaging app WeChat. While no official explanation was given, observers suggested the crackdown was related to previous comparisons of President Xi Jinping with the portly bear created by the English author AA Milne that went viral. Apart from China\u2019s growth figures, economists are also digesting the conclusions of a conference on regulation held by Chinese officials last weekend. There\u2019s much interest in president Xi\u2019s decision to create a cabinet-level committee to coordinate financial oversight. That could be a sign that Beijing is more concerned about problems brewing in the country\u2019s financial system. The official statement issued after the conference said that the \u201ceternal theme\u201d was to prevent systemic risk building up in the Chinese economy. Premier Li Keqiang called for financial oversight to be \u201cprofessional, consolidated and penetrating\u201d, and there was also a warning that failing to spot problems Strong words were also heard on greater accountability for regulators, with the statement saying it would be a \u201cdereliction of duty\u201d if regulators fail to spot risks and tackle them in time... Capital Economics says these pledges are more important than the actual growth figures..... This also explains why the Chinese stock market fell today, while other market rallied. A clampdown on risky lending, or financial bubbles, would surely feed through to asset prices... Several economists are predicting that China\u2019s growth rate will ease, sooner or later. Zhou Hao, an economist with Commerzbank, says (via the WSJ): \u201cThough the Chinese economy was holding up better than expected in the first half of the year, a slowdown is kind of inevitable.\u201d And Robin Bew of the Economist Intelligence Unit reckons Chinese growth will hold up for a few months more. Guardian Business has launched a daily email. Besides the key news headlines that you\u2019d expect, there\u2019s an at-a-glance agenda of the day\u2019s main events, insightful opinion pieces and a quality feature to sink your teeth into each day. For your morning shot of financial news, sign up here: If China\u2019s GDP does hold up, then it could post its first year of faster growth since 2010. Dan Wang, China analyst at the Economist Intelligence Unit, believes today\u2019s growth figures bode well for the next six months.... China\u2019s economy will hold up for the second half of the year, given sustained state-led investment and robust household spending. The monetary policy will remain neutral--cracking down shadow banking while increasing lending through formal banking channel. Given the high base in 2017, however, to sustain high growth for 2018 will be tough. The pound has fallen back from last week\u2019s 10-month high this morning, as City traders fret about Brexit. David Davis, Britain\u2019s secretary of state for exiting the European Union, is back in Brussels for fresh talks with EU officials (although only one side had their paperwork on display.....) The weekend\u2019s newspapers brought a blizzard of negative stories about cabinet members, particularly Philip Hammond. The chancellor was roasted for telling colleagues that public sector workers were overpaid, and \u2018joking\u2019 that even a woman could drive a train (unless she was too busy starring in Dr Who or running the country, I guess). Transport secretary Chris Grayling has now denied that the cabinet is riven with infighting, but this didn\u2019t stop the pound losing 0.2% to $1.307. Foreign secretary Boris Johnson\u2019s claim last week that the EU could \u2018whistle\u2019 for an exit payment from Britain has also worried the City. Joshua Mahony of IG says: UK-EU Brexit discussions continue apace today, with the relationship seemingly souring amid critical comments from Boris Johnson and a drive from France towards a hard Brexit. There is now a clear need to get a transitional deal into place, with the negotiations looking ever more unlikely to conclude satisfactorily within the two-year deadline. It\u2019s official! Inflation across the eurozone eased a little last month. The eurozone\u2019s consumer prices index rose by 1.3% in June, says Eurostat, matching last month\u2019s \u2018flash\u2019 estimate. That\u2019s down on 1.4% in May, and further away from the European Central Bank\u2019s target of just below 2%. As this tweet shows, prices are rising rather faster in the UK, where CPI hit 2.9% in May. June\u2019s UK inflation data is out tomorrow, and will probably show that the cost of living squeeze continues.... China\u2019s growth figures are often treated with some scepticism. Analysts often question whether the data can really be trusted, given the temptation to massage bad date and the sheer challenge of measuring economic output over such a huge economy. And China certainly has an impressive track record of hitting Beijing\u2019s official growth targets..... But having said that, today\u2019s GDP report is being taken quite seriously, thanks to the flurry of decent retail sales, investment and factory production data. Marc Ostwald of ADM Investor Services has all the details: It was the monthly data which impressed, with Retail Sales at 11.0% y/y posting its strongest growth since December 2015, and all the more robust given that this is a value not a volume measure, and CPI inflation has been very subdued in recent months. Industrial Production \u2018smashed\u2019 forecasts at 7.6% vs. expectations of an unchanged 6.5% y/y, with the breakdown highlighting strength in \u2018new economy\u2019 (Telecoms/Computing 13.1% y/y vs prior 10.3%), Pharmaceuticals (13.6% vs./ 10.75) and the volatile / seasonal Food sector 11.0% vs. 7.6%), while resource processing sectors\u2019 output remains subdued, which can only be considered to be healthy. Taking all of this in conjunction with the solid 7.2% y/y in the Private sector investment component of Fixed Asset Investment (8.6% vs. expected 8.5%), there is goodly volume of evidence that China\u2019s economy is indeed rebalancing away from being investment led to consumption led, paced both by domestic and external demand, given the 3.6% contribution from Net Exports to 2017 H1 GDP. UK construction companies are rubbing their hands with glee this morning after winning contracts for Britain\u2019s new HS2 high-speed rail line. The government has awarded \u00a36.6bn of work to construct the section between London and Birmingham. Successful bidders include Carillion\u2019s joint venture with French construction company Eiffage and UK firm Kier. Carillion desperately needs some good news, after shocking the City a week ago with a whopping profits warning and huge writedowns on certain contracts. Shares in ITV have jumped to the top of the FTSE 100 leaderboard, after the broadcaster snaffled Carolyn McCall from easyJet to be its next CEO. ITV announced McCall\u2019s appointment this morning, two days after we reported she was the \u2018preferred candidate\u2019 for the role. My colleague Mark Sweney has the details: McCall, a former chief executive of the Guardian Media Group, will join ITV on 8 January, replacing Adam Crozier, who left the company at the end of June. ITV chairman Sir Peter Bazalgette, the former chairman and creative chief of Big Brother maker Endemol, had been keen to replace him with a successor with serious experience at a publicly-listed company. McCall has been appointed from a final shortlist of three which included Paul Geddes, the Direct Line chief and Channel 4 board member, and the Dixons Carphone boss, Sebastian James. Bazalgette says: \u201cIn a very impressive field of high-calibre candidates, Carolyn stood out for her track record in media, experience of an international operation, clear strategic acumen and strong record of delivering value to shareholders. I\u2019m delighted we\u2019ll be working together at ITV.\u201d More here: European stock markets have opened higher, thanks to China\u2019s growth figures. Mining shares are rallying in London, on the prospect of greater demand for copper, nickel, iron ore and coal. And that has pushed the FTSE 100 up by 28 points, or 0.4%, to 7407. The French, German and Spanish markets are also rising, helping to keep global share prices at today\u2019s all-time peak. Connor Campbell of City firm SpreadEX says Europe\u2019s traders have begun the week in a good mood, boosted by the wave of data from China. Overnight there was a quartet of important Chinese figures, led by a better than expected 6.9% GDP reading. That was joined by a far stronger than forecast industrial production number, an 11% increase in retail sales year-on-year and solid fixed asset investment figure. China takes in a lot of raw materials, to drive its factories and underpin its infrastructure spending. So it\u2019s not surprising to see commodity prices on the rise, following the Chinese GDP report. In London, Copper has hit its highest level since March, gaining 0.8% to $5,970.5 per tonne. Meanwhile in China, the cosy of steel in China has risen to a new three and a half-year high. Craig James, chief economist at Commonwealth Securities in Sydney, says China\u2019s latest growth figures may indicate that the world economy is holding up. He says (via Reuters): \u201c(The new data) is encouraging for global growth as well because China is the second largest economy on the planet.\u201d \u201cBased on this data, there is no need for easing and no need really for tightening either because inflationary pressures are very much contained. So I think the People\u2019s Bank of China just continues to be watchful.\u201d Bill Adams, senior international economist at PNC Bank, believes the figures bode well for growth across developing economies. He writes: As China goes, so go emerging markets. Its solid growth reinforces recoveries for commodity exporters and keeps 2017\u2019s pick-up in global growth on track,\u201d But Elsa Lignos, global head of FX strategy at Royal Bank of Canada, points out that the growth was probably driven by borrowing. She writes: China Q2 GDP was firmer than expected (6.9%y/y, cons 6.8%, prior 6.9%), driven by a sizeable pick-up in industrial production. Sentiment was dampened by the Stats Bureau\u2019s acknowledgement that H1 economic growth was \u201chard won\u201d. Our Asia strategist calls that an understatement to be sure; GDP growth was clearly buffered by significant credit expansion to ensure headline growth remained at or above target. Most recognise the dangerous imbalances/can-kicking involved in China\u2019s growth strategy. The news that China\u2019s GDP beat expectations drove shares up across Asia, although ironically Chinese investors didn\u2019t share the enthusiasm. The Hong Kong Hang Seng rose by 0.3%, while Korea\u2019s Kospi and India\u2019s Sensex gained almost 0.4%. That helped to drive global markets to a new all-time high: Mike van Dulken of Accendo Markets says \u201cbetter-than-expected China GDP data\u201d boosted confidence. This after six years of slowing, suggesting successful management of stimulus. However, the party didn\u2019t reach China itself, where the Shanghai Shenzhen CSI 300 Index dropped by almost 1%. The selloff was sparked by traders rushing to sell shares after the People\u2019s Bank of China injected fresh liquidity into the system. That caused some alarm on the trading floors, as Marketwatch explains: \u201cIt\u2019s reverse psychology,\u201d said Hao Hong, managing director and head of research at BOCOM International. \u201cIf everything is fine, you don\u2019t have to inject liquidity. But if they\u2019re injecting liquidity, something must be wrong.\u201d Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. China has got the new week off to a good start, by releasing growth figures that beat City expectations. The Chinese economy grew at an annual pace of 6.9% in the last quarter, according to official government figures, matching China\u2019s growth in January-March. That beat analyst forecasts of 6.8%, and is ahead of Beijing\u2019s target of growing GDP by 6.5% this year. This should calm concerns that China\u2019s economy is heading for a hard landing, as its leaders try to shift away from manufacturing and towards a service-based economy. The National Bureau of Statistics said the figures showed China\u2019s economy had become \u201cmore stable, co-ordinated and sustainable\u201d. But the agency also struck a cautious notes, saying that : Overall, the economy continued to show steady progress in the first half...but international instability and uncertainties are still relatively large, and the domestic long-term buildup of structural imbalances remain. The NBS also warned that China\u2019s economy also faces \u201cmany unstable and uncertain factors abroad\u201d; perhaps a nod to president Trump\u2019s protectionist rhetoric, or perhaps Britain\u2019s exit from the EU.... Separate government figures also suggested that the Chinese economy seems to be holding up, despite persistent worries over the country\u2019s growing debts. They showed that: China\u2019s factory output grew 7.6% in June from a year earlier, the fastest pace in three months, Fixed-asset investment expanded by 8.6% percent in the first six months of 2017 both beating forecasts. Retail sales rose 11.0% in June from a year earlier, the fastest pace since December 2015 I\u2019ll pull some reaction together now.... Also coming up today: The final estimate of inflation across the euro area is released this morning. It\u2019s likely to confirm that the eurozone inflation rate dropped to 1.3% in June, taking some pressure off the European Central Bank to start tapering its stimulus programme. In the US, we also get a new healthcheck on New York\u2019s manufacturing sector. 10am BST: Eurozone Consumer Price Index for June 1.30pm BST: The US Empire Manufacturing (JUL)",

But there was still some caution ahead of a busy week for US company results, while weak US manufacturing figures added to the expectation that the Federal Reserve would hold back on further rate rises.</p> <p>So in all it was a mixed performance. Most European markets dipped back, but the Chinese data helped lift commodity prices and in turn mining shares, which pushed the FTSE 100 higher. David Madden, market analyst at CMC Markets UK, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>European equity markets are mixed today, but London\u2019s large exposure to commodity related companies has given it the edge over its eurozone counterparts. The better-than-expected growth numbers from China boosted the share price of Rio Tinto, Glencore, Anglo American and BHP Billiton. The second-largest economy in the world is easily on target to achieve its 2017 growth target of 6.5%, as it grew by 6.9% in the first quarter and second quarter.</p> </blockquote> <p>Meanwhile the MSCI World Index has reached a new record, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average has shrugged off early losses to edge higher, after hitting another intra day peak on Friday.

The UK index is up 50 points, and is just about keeping its head above 7400, thanks to the dual boosts of some China-inspired gains in the commodity sector and a Brexit-dragged showing from sterling, which is down between 0.1-0.2% against the dollar and the euro.</p> <p>The pound is set to jump back into the spotlight tomorrow morning with the release of the latest inflation reading.

June monthly indicators, such as industrial production and retails sales, are also showing strength. Monetary tightening has helped slow the domestic economy but the upside in Q2 2017 GDP came from stronger external demand. Due to stronger than expected growth in the first half of this year, we have revised up our 2017 GDP forecast to 6.8% from 6.7%. We still expect a mild slowdown in H2 2017.</p> <p>Over the weekend President Xi of China announced the creation of a super regulator called the Financial Stability and Development Committee (FSDC). This move clearly shows that the government and President Xi see the increasing risk from financial market instability as a priority. The contagion risk bleeding from financial market risk to political risk has grown to a point where President Xi needs to monitor this at the State Council level. Another implication is that financial market development will slow as when authorities are focused on risk, the market becomes more conservative and liberalisation slows.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-596c9e65e4b08eb8aa039ba3\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-07-17T12:43:11.832Z\">1.43pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>The other news out of China today is that Winnie the Pooh has seemingly fallen foul of the country\u2019s internet censors.</strong></p> <p>The much-loved, tubby bear can no longer be discussed on Chinese social media sites, apparently as part of a new crackdown by Beijing.</p> <p>But it\u2019s not all bad for Pooh; he has been given a prime position on the front page of the Financial Times, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/cf7fd22e-69d5-11e7-bfeb-33fe0c5b7eaa\">which says</a>:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Posts including the Chinese name of the fictional bear were censored on Sina Weibo, ChinaTwitter-like platform, over the weekend, while a collection of animated gifs featuring the bear were removed from social messaging app WeChat.</p> <p>While no official explanation was given, observers suggested the crackdown was related to previous comparisons of President Xi Jinping with the portly bear created by the English author AA Milne that went viral.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/TonyTassell/status/886830050573787140\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Winnie the Pooh makes the front page of the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/FT\">@FT</a> (and Xi) <a href=\"https://t.co/OZ1JUUveyz\">pic.twitter.com/OZ1JUUveyz</a></p>&mdash; Tony Tassell (@TonyTassell) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/TonyTassell/status/886830050573787140\">July 17, 2017</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-596ca4b7e4b08eb8aa039bcc\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-07-17T12:40:36.654Z\">1.40pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Apart from China\u2019s growth figures, economists are also digesting the conclusions of a conference on regulation held by Chinese officials last weekend.</strong></p> <p>There\u2019s much interest in president Xi\u2019s decision to create a cabinet-level committee to coordinate financial oversight.

This should calm concerns that China\u2019s economy is heading for a hard landing, as its leaders try to shift away from manufacturing and towards a service-based economy. </p> <p>The National Bureau of Statistics said the figures showed China\u2019s economy had become \u201cmore stable, co-ordinated and sustainable\u201d.</p> <p>But the agency also struck a cautious notes, saying that :</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Overall, the economy continued to show steady progress in the first half...but international instability and uncertainties are still relatively large, and the domestic long-term buildup of structural imbalances remain.</p> </blockquote> <p>The NBS also warned that China\u2019s economy also faces \u201cmany unstable and uncertain factors abroad\u201d; perhaps a nod to president Trump\u2019s protectionist rhetoric, or perhaps Britain\u2019s exit from the EU....</p> <p>Separate government figures also suggested that the Chinese economy seems to be holding up, despite persistent worries over the country\u2019s growing debts.</p> <p>They showed that:</p> <ul> <li><strong>China\u2019s factory output</strong> grew 7.6% in June from a year earlier, the fastest pace in three months,<strong><br></strong></li> <li><strong>Fixed-asset investment</strong> expanded by 8.6% percent in the first six months of 2017 both beating forecasts.<br></li> <li><strong>Retail sales</strong> rose 11.0% in June from a year earlier, the fastest pace since December 2015<br></li> </ul> <p><em>I\u2019ll pull some reaction together now....</em></p> <h2>Also coming up today:</h2> <p>The final estimate of inflation across the euro area is released this morning. It\u2019s likely to confirm that the eurozone inflation rate dropped to 1.3% in June, taking some pressure off the European Central Bank to start tapering its stimulus programme.</p> <p>In the US, we also get a new healthcheck on New York\u2019s manufacturing sector.</p> <ul> <li>10am BST: Eurozone Consumer Price Index for June<br></li> <li>1.30pm BST: The US Empire Manufacturing (JUL)<br></li> </ul> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2017-07-17T07:09:28.874Z\">at 8.09am BST</time></p>  </div>",

    "webTitle": "HS2 contracts worth \u00a36.6bn awarded by UK government", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The government has awarded \u00a36.6bn in contracts to build the new high-speed HS2 railway between London and Birmingham, to companies including crisis-ridden construction firm Carillion. Construction work is due to begin next year on new stations, tunnels, embankments and viaducts on the London to Birmingham line, which forms the first phase of the controversial HS2 project. The civil engineering alone is expected to create 16,000 jobs. The TUC welcomed the contract awards as a \u201cshot in the arm for Brexit Britain\u201d. The union\u2019s deputy general secretary, Paul Nowak, said: \u201cIt will provide thousands of decent jobs, billions in investment, and help close the north-south divide. HS2 is a real opportunity for British steel to shine. The next phase of HS2 should bring jobs and investment to the parts of Britain that need them most.\u201d The TUC has signed a framework agreement to guarantee high employment standards and to \u201cmaximise the potential benefits of HS2 to the UK supply chain\u201d. Chris Grayling, the transport secretary, also published a bill to prioritise phase 2a of HS2, which involves speeding up construction work between Birmingham and Crewe, and confirmed the precise route for phase2b, which will run north via Manchester and Leeds. In the wake of fresh claims that the HS2 scheme could be beset by escalating costs, Grayling told the BBC that HS2 would be \u201con time, on budget\u201d and insisted the government had \u201ca clear idea of what it will cost\u201d. Opponents have warned that the government is underestimating the costs, and that construction has already been delayed. The overall budget was revised up to \u00a355.7bn, but estimates drawn up on behalf of Lord Berkeley, chairman of the Rail Freight Group, suggested it could be as high as \u00a3111bn. Grayling dismissed the figure as \u201cnonsense\u201d. Asked about the decision to spend on infrastructure while there is a 1% cap on public sector pay, Grayling said: \u201cThat\u2019s a very different issue because we are talking about capital investment over the next 15 years. We are not talking about current spending that the chancellor will decide on come the budget.\u201d Carillion\u2019s joint venture with French construction company Eiffage and UK firm Kier has won two contracts worth \u00a31.4bn to design and build the North Portal Chiltern tunnels to Brackley and the Brackley to Long Itchington Wood Green tunnel South Portal. The troubled construction company\u2019s share price crashed 70% last week after it issued a profit warning and announced the departure of its chief executive. However, Carillion shares were up more than 19% on Monday after the HS2 contract win. The firm announced it had appointed accountancy firm EY to support a strategic review of the business. City analysts said the win was \u201cencouraging\u201d for Carillion\u2019s shareholders, but remained sceptical about the firm\u2019s outlook. Neil Wilson of ETX capital said: \u201cWhether it can deliver these contracts is another matter. It could make it a slightly more attractive prospect to rescue if it comes to that.\u201d Balfour Beatty\u2019s joint venture with French firm Vinci has won two contracts worth \u00a32.5bn. They will design and build the Long Itchington Wood Green tunnel to the Delta Junction/Birmingham Spur and the section from the Delta Junction to the west coast main line near Lichfield in Staffordshire. Vinci has been involved in the high-speed Tours-Bordeaux rail project in France. The Balfour Beatty chief executive, Leo Quinn, described HS2 as a \u201cgenerational engineering project\u201d. A joint venture between Sweden-based Skanska, Austria\u2019s Strabag and UK firm Costain, which has worked on Crossrail and the Channel tunnel, won contracts worth nearly \u00a32bn. Other companies to have won HS2 work are French construction group Bouygues and UK firms Sir Robert McAlpine and VolkerFitzpatrick. Their venture was awarded a \u00a3965m contract. The RMT union demanded the government ensure proper employment on all the contracts, noting that several of the firms had been involved in the blacklisting scandal settled last year. Aslef\u2019s Mick Whelan called for a government pledge not to sell off HS2, after Britain\u2019s only current high-speed track, HS1, was sold on last week by pension funds who were awarded the concession. Whelan said HS2 was being paid for by the taxpayer and should \u201cnot be asset stripped by any government for the benefit of privateers\u201d. The first trains are due to run between London and Birmingham in 2026, with the full Y-shaped network expected to be in operation by 2033.

      "bodyText": "Although he is a keen sportsman, Bank of England governor Mark Carney may be wise to take some time this weekend to brush up on the classics in advance of the unveiling of the new \u00a310 note in Winchester cathedral on Tuesday. Jane Austen will be the face of the new polymer banknote, and we are told that the governor and other speakers will take questions on the author of Pride and Prejudice at the event, which also marks the 200th anniversary of the writer\u2019s death. The Bank will be hoping the launch of the new note, in circulation from September, will mark a hat-trick of relatively storm-free currency introductions following the new \u00a31 coin and \u00a35 note, although the presence in the notes of tallow, a byproduct of beef or mutton fat, may reignite pressure from vegans and animal rights activists \u2013 pressure the bank has previously refused to bow to. When Carney joined the Bank as governor in 2013, much was made of his bumper pay package. After a generous housing allowance and pension contributions were added to the base salary, the total came close to \u00a31m, putting him well ahead of his predecessor Mervyn King. By Austen\u2019s standards, this must make him a very contented banker. \u201cA large income is the best recipe for happiness I ever heard of,\u201d the author wrote in Mansfield Park. Reports of Sports Direct\u2019s health may make Ashley sick Another week, another Sports Direct story. Details of Mike Ashley\u2019s unusual business practices came to light in the high court recently, most memorably about how he considers himself a \u201cpower drinker\u201d who once vomited into the fireplace of a pub at the end of a particularly robust drinking game. Last week, it emerged the retailer had bought a near 26% stake in struggling video-games retailer Game Digital to add to a string of high-street investments, which include Debenhams and French Connection. On Thursday, the company\u2019s full-year results will reveal its financial health. Last December, the company warned it expected trading conditions to remain challenging as it reported a 57% drop in profits for the first half of the year. The sports retailer, which suffered following a scandal surrounding working practices at its stores, blamed a political, union and media-led campaign for damage to its reputation, while Ashley admitted that it had been a tough period for the performance of the company. In March, it emerged it faces a rise in the cost of supplying goods to European stores after a contract that shielded it from a weakening euro ended. Ashley may need a pint by the end of the week. Breaking the inflation barrier Will inflation reach or break the 3% barrier this week? It rose to a four-year high in May as the pound\u2019s post-Brexit fall in value worked its way through the economy. Economists\u2019 expectations were confounded when it jumped to 2.9%. Now, with figures for June due this week, observers will be looking to see whether it hits or tops 3% \u2013 seen as an unlikely prospect not so long ago. The EU referendum prompted a sharp drop in the value of the pound, pushing up the cost of imported goods \u2013 electronics, clothes and food among others. This is now trickling down into the shopping baskets of the average household. In May 2016, a month before the vote, inflation stood at just 0.3%. After hedges against currency ran out earlier this year, the costs of household goods started to rise. Last month\u2019s sharp rise took commentators by surprise, with many expecting it to stay at April\u2019s 2.7%. The Office for National Statistics said higher food and electricity prices had contributed to the rise, as had higher oil prices. Whether or not the 3% barrier is reached or broken this week, there appears to be an expectation that it will get there eventually. A Bloomberg survey of economists last month said the rate would peak at 3% by the last three months of the year.",

    "webTitle": "Carolyn McCall to become ITV chief executive", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "ITV has confirmed the appointment of Carolyn McCall as its first female chief executive. McCall joins ITV from easyJet, where she has been chief executive for seven years. She was previously chief executive of the Guardian Media Group (GMG), publisher of the Guardian and Observer. She will join the broadcaster on 8 January, replacing Adam Crozier, who left the company at the end of June. The ITV chairman, Sir Peter Bazalgette, the former chairman and creative chief of Big Brother-maker Endemol, had been keen to replace him with a successor with serious experience at a publicly listed company. McCall has been appointed from a final shortlist of three that included Paul Geddes, the Direct Line chief and Channel 4 board member, and the Dixons Carphone boss, Sebastian James. McCall was chosen as preferred candidate at the end of last month. ITV said her total remuneration would be \u201cbroadly the same\u201d as Crozier, who earned about \u00a327m over his seven years in charge. This is slightly less than the \u00a330m McCall earned from starting at easyJet in 2010 to the end of the airline\u2019s financial year in September. The broadcaster is paying McCall a base salary of \u00a3900,000, \u00a341,000 less than Crozier, and her pension allowance has been reduced to 15% of her salary compared with her predecessor\u2019s 25%. However, under the performance share plan McCall will be eligible for 265% of salary, while Crozier was awarded 225%. The existing annual bonus of up to 180% of salary remains the same. The remuneration structure is in line with a change voted through at ITV\u2019s annual meeting in May to put more emphasis on the longer-term performance of the business through a five-year share award scheme. McCall has negotiated a slightly sweeter deal than the one she had at easyJet. Her base pay is almost \u00a3200,000 higher, her pension allowance is double and the performance share plan award is better. Only her annual bonus maximum, at 200% of salary at easyJet, is slightly lower in her new role. ITV, with a \u00a37bn market capitalisation, is about 25% bigger than easyJet. The broadcaster is giving McCall an award worth less than \u00a32.5m to cover the cost of unvested bonus and long-term incentive share plan awards she had to forfeit leaving easJet. McCall said she already missed easyJet \u2013 which suffered a share price slump and sharp fall in profits last year, its first decline in six years, and is due to open a European HQ to operate EU flights post-Brexit \u2013 but said the ITV opportunity \u201cfelt like the right one to take\u201d. \u201cThis was a really difficult decision for me to make,\u201d she told easyJet investors in a stock market statement. \u201cAfter seven years, the opportunity from ITV felt like the right one to take. It is a fantastic company in a dynamic and stimulating sector. EasyJet is a structural winner in a brilliant position, and I look forward to being a loyal customer in the years to come.\u201d McCall, 55, was appointed a dame for services to the aviation industry last year. ITV\u2019s share price received a 2% bump in early trading on Monday as investors took a shine to McCall\u2019s transition from airlines to airwaves. \u201cWe view this appointment as positive,\u201d said Tamsin Garrity, an equity analyst at Jefferies. \u201cMcCall has an understanding of the commercial side of the business, which complements a creative chairman at ITV, and has weathered some tougher times at easyJet while trebling the share price.\u201d McCall, who was brought up in India and Singapore, joins as ITV faces headwinds from a slump in the TV ad market and the stalling of ITV Studios, which makes shows including Coronation Street, Come Dine With Me, Victoria and Poldark. McCall joined GMG in 1986 and rose through the commercial ranks to become chief executive of the newspaper business, Guardian News &amp; Media, in 2000 and of the parent company in 2006. \u201cThis provides solid media experience in the world of advertising, which remains the majority of ITV\u2019s revenue,\u201d said Garrity. During her GMG tenure McCall was responsible for overseeing the move of the Guardian from a broadsheet format to the Berliner, and was responsible for the sale of its regional newspaper arm, which included the Manchester Evening News. McCall was also active in the sale of a stake in Trader Media Group, parent of AutoTrader, to Apax for \u00a3675m, and acquiring Emap\u2019s business-to-business magazine and events arm, which included the Cannes Lions advertising festival, alongside Apax for \u00a31bn. She is also a non-executive director at Burberry, where last week a third of shareholders failed to back the luxury brand\u2019s remuneration report in a protest over high pay. She has previously held non-executive director roles at Lloyds TSB, Tesco and New Look. \u201cIn a very impressive field of high-calibre candidates, Carolyn stood out for her track record in media, experience of an international operation, clear strategic acumen and strong record of delivering value to shareholders,\u201d said Bazalgette. \u201cI\u2019m delighted we\u2019ll be working together at ITV.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Lloyd\u2019s of London has warned that a serious cyber-attack could cost the global economy more than $120bn (\u00a392bn) \u2013 as much as catastrophic natural disasters such as Hurricanes Katrina and Sandy. Published two months after a ransomware cyber-attack that hobbled NHS hospitals and hit nearly 100 countries, a 56-page report from the world\u2019s oldest insurance market says the threat posed by such global attacks has spiralled and poses a huge risk to business and governments over the next decade. The most likely scenario is a malicious hack that takes down a cloud service provider with estimated losses of $53bn, according to Lloyd\u2019s. This is the average estimate, but because of the uncertainty around calculating cyber losses it estimates the figure could be as high as $121bn or as low as $15bn. At the upper end, the cost would outstrip the damage wreaked by Hurricane Katrina in 2005, estimated at $108bn (including $80bn of insured losses). Hurricane Sandy in 2012 is estimated to have caused economic losses of $50bn-$70bn. Inga Beale, chief executive of Lloyd\u2019s, said: \u201cThis report gives a real sense of the scale of damage a cyber-attack could cause the global economy. Just like some of the worst natural catastrophes, cyber events can cause a severe impact on businesses and economies, trigger multiple claims and dramatically increase insurers\u2019 claims costs. \u201cUnderwriters need to consider cyber cover in this way and ensure that premium calculations keep pace with the cyber-threat reality,\u201d she said. The second-most likely threat stems from attacks on computer operating systems run by a large number of businesses around the world, which could cause losses of up to $28.7bn (the \u201cmass software vulnerability scenario\u201d). The majority of these losses are not insured, leaving governments and businesses vulnerable if cyber-attacks happen. The uninsured gap could be as high as $45bn for the cloud services scenario, and $26bn for the mass vulnerability scenario. Trevor Maynard, Lloyd\u2019s head of innovation and co-author of the report with the cybersecurity firm Cyence, said the global cyberattack in May \u201cshowed us that these sorts of attacks are absolutely possible\u201d. Financial services is most at risk, followed by software and technology, hospitality, retail and healthcare. Cyber cover is a relatively new type of insurance that has emerged in the last few years \u2013 Lloyds\u2019s accounts for about a quarter of global premiums \u2013 and harder to model and understand than natural catastrophe cover. Where people are involved, risk changes quite rapidly, Maynard said, from cyber-attacks to terrorism and political risk. However, climate change remains the biggest challenge in the long run. \u201cFrom year to year, risk varies relatively little but climate change in the end will be far larger as a risk,\u201d he said. \u201cIt affects the global economic structure, food, water. [It\u2019s like] trying to turn a supertanker around \u2013 we can\u2019t start in 30 years when things are going bad, we have to start now.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Investors are enjoying a stellar 2017, with rising share prices being supplemented by record-breaking dividend payments, new research shows. Shareholders in companies listed on London\u2019s main market received \u00a333.3bn in payments during the second quarter of this year, up 14.5% year on year, according to the latest analysis by Capita, a services company. The growth, which has come on top of rising share indices during 2017, is attributed to high special dividends and large gains because of movements in foreign exchange rates. After stripping out one off payments via special dividends, underlying receipts to shareholders rose by 12.6%. Justin Cooper, a spokesman for Capita Asset Services, said: \u201cShareholders can be thankful they had punchy special dividends and the weak pound in their corner, but improving profits have also played their part. Exchange rate gains have come not only for big multinationals declaring dividends in foreign currencies, but also for others with overseas operations, or export sales, supercharging their profits and so their dividends. \u201cThe relative strength of the UK consumer, until recently at least, and surging economic growth abroad has supported stronger dividend growth than we have seen in some time. Even though the second half is going to be much quieter, investors can look forward to dividends hitting a new record this year\u201d. Dividends are received by owners of shares in companies. The payments by publicly listed companies are crucial to major investors such as pension funds, which need continuous streams of income, as well as rising share prices, in order to fund retirement schemes. However, there is a constant tension within businesses to ensure they balance the amounts they pay out to shareholders in the short term, with money invested in their companies in order to grow them over a longer period and produce consistent returns. Capita said that special payouts of \u00a34.6bn were the second-highest on record for any quarter, owing mainly to a \u00a33.2bn payment from National Grid on the sale of its 61% stake in its UK gas distribution business. Meanwhile, Lloyds Banking Group, paid \u00a3357m as a special dividend, on top of a \u00a31.2bn regular dividend. Dividend growth was also strong in the resurgent mining industry, where every company raised payouts and Glencore and Rio Tinto made particularly large payouts for the sector. In the consumer goods and housebuilder groups, every company also increased its payout, the study said. The Capita research examines dividends paid out on the ordinary shares of companies listed on the UK main market, the London stock exchange\u2019s listing of its most established companies. The research excludes investment companies such as listed investment trusts whose dividends rely on income from equities and bonds.",
