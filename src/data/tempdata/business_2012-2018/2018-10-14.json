Cui Tiankai was asked on Fox News Sunday if he thought the president is guided by moderates or hardliners. \u201cYou tell me,\u201d he replied. \u201cHonestly, I\u2019ve been talking to ambassadors of other countries in Washington DC and this is also part of their problem.\u201d Diplomats, Cui said, \u201cdon\u2019t know who is the final decision-maker. Of course, presumably, the president will take the final decision. But who is playing what role? Sometimes it could be very confusing.\u201d Cui could have sought the advice of another guest on the same show, Trump\u2019s chief economic adviser, Larry Kudlow, a former free trader who now follows the official line. Asked if the US and China were on the brink of a \u201ccold war\u201d, Kudlow told Fox he had been \u201cvery involved in the trade talks with China\u201d. He could have spoken for Cui too when he added: \u201cThose talks have been unsatisfactory.\u201d Confrontation with Beijing has long been central to Trump\u2019s worldview, particularly since Steve Bannon, a fierce China hawk, advised on White House policy. Bannon is gone from Trump\u2019s orbit but another key aide, director of the Office of Trade and Manufacturing Policy Peter Navarro, is a tariffs hardliner and ultra-loyalist who seems to have the president\u2019s ear. Speaking to Bloomberg in March, he said: \u201cMy function really as an economist is to try to provide the underlying analytics that confirm [Trump\u2019s] intuition. And his intuition is always right in these matters.\u201d In a column published by Fox this week, Navarro linked policies meant to protect US businesses to the emergence of China as a major military threat. The US trade representative, meanwhile, is Robert Lighthizer. Politico said this month he was implementing \u201ca clear but ultra high-risk battle plan to smash China\u201d.",

      "bodyText": "Scientists have turned coffee waste into electricity for the first time, in research that could help farmers and curb pollution in the developing world. The coffee industry generates a huge amount of liquid waste during the process of turning the raw material of the tree \u2013 the coffee cherries \u2013 into the 9.5m tons of coffee the world produces each year. Wastewater is generated by farms during the washing of coffee seeds, or beans, and during the water-intensive process of making instant coffee. But now a UK-funded programme, working with Colombian researchers, has proven that it can not only remove the contaminants from the water but make electricity in the process. A team led by the University of Surrey developed a fuel cell that uses microbes instead of chemicals like a fuel cell in a hydrogen car, which eat the waste matter and generate a small amount of energy. Dr Claudio Avignone Rossa, a systems microbiologist at the university, said: \u201cYou\u2019re not going to light up London with these things, but you\u2019re going to put a light where there was none. \u201cThe farmer will be getting a little bit of energy coming from the waste they are throwing away. So the environment will be cleaner. The finances of the farm will be improved.\u201d While coffee waste has been used as biofuel before, and compacted to be sold as \u201cbiologs\u201d to be burned, the project is believed to be the first to produce electricity from such waste. Claire Perry, energy minister, hailed the work as an example of the UK\u2019s expertise in the green economy. \u201cYour morning latte could start its life on a remote Colombian coffee farm and now, thanks to UK-government funded research, those farms now have grounds to double up as producers of both coffee beans and electricity,\u201d she said. The microbes that convert the coffee waste were of the sort that occur in sludge from wastewater treatment plants, but Avignone Rossa said they could also be found on Colombian farms. \u201cSupply is not a problem,\u201d he added. The microbial fuel cells made by the researchers are roughly the size of a fizzy drink can. While the lab versions were made of Perspex and stainless steel and cost \u00a3300-\u00a3500, the team also produced ones for less than \u00a32 using materials like ceramics and disposable plastic boxes. Avignone Rossa said he was waiting on responses from funding agencies for money to build a prototype in the field in Colombia.",

      "bodyText": "The British economy is heading for its worst year in almost a decade amid the growing risks from no-deal Brexit, according to a leading economic forecaster. After official figures revealed zero growth in GDP in August, the EY Item Club said the economy would struggle to recover in the final months of the year owing to the increasing likelihood of Britain crashing out of the EU in less than six months\u2019 time. The group of economists, which is the only non-government forecasting organisation to use the Treasury modelling of the economy, said it had downgraded its growth forecast for this year and next as a consequence. It forecast growth of 1.3% for the whole of 2018, down from a previous estimate of 1.4%. This would be the worst annual period for growth since the financial crisis. It also downgraded the outlook for the second quarter running. EY Item Club forecast a modest recovery next year if there was a smooth Brexit deal, with growth of 1.5%, down from its previous estimate of 1.6%. Economists have said failure to reach such a deal could significantly harm the UK economy, with the International Monetary Fund warning of \u201cdire consequences\u201d for growth. The government\u2019s economic forecaster, the Office for Budget Responsibility, last week raised the prospect of a no-deal scenario triggering border delays, companies and consumers stockpiling food and other supplies, and aircraft being unable to fly in and out of Britain. The Item Club said Brexit uncertainties were influencing business investment decisions, but added that efforts to find alternative suppliers in the UK rather than the EU may lead to an increase in spending. It also said weaker growth in the eurozone had sapped appetite for exports, as the world economy digests the impact of US import tariffs that have already begun to drag on economic activity. Inflation is forecast to fall from about 2.7% to 2.3% by the end of the year, above the Bank of England\u2019s target rate. Consumer spending growth is estimated to remain limited as a consequence, as UK households remain under pressure from weak wage growth and relatively high levels of inflation. Howard Archer, the chief economic adviser to the Item Club, said: \u201cHeightened uncertainties in the run-up to and the aftermath of the UK\u2019s exit could fuel business and consumer caution. This is a significant factor leading us to trim our GDP forecasts for 2018 and 2019. \u201cShould the UK leave the EU in March 2019 without any deal, the near-term growth outlook could be significantly weaker.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Luke Johnson, the serial entrepreneur behind Patisserie Valerie, described the cake chain\u2019s near-collapse as a nightmare, as he said the company had run up nearly \u00a310m in secret overdrafts. Patisserie Valerie\u2019s finance director was arrested last week, after the company stunned the stock market by revealing it had found \u201csignificant, and potentially fraudulent, accounting irregularities\u201d, reported to be more than \u00a320m. Speaking after he agreed to lend \u00a320m of his own money to keep the business afloat, Johnson said he had experienced the \u201cmost harrowing week of my life\u201d, which felt like a \u201cnightmare that I\u2019d wake up from\u201d. \u201cThere were 2,800 jobs at stake, there was 12 years of effort that I and colleagues had put into the business and the board were determined not to allow the business to go into administration,\u201d he told the Sunday Times. Johnson has paused his weekly column with the newspaper, which also reported details of secret overdrafts that directors said they discovered only this week. The existence of two facilities worth \u00a39.7m, with HSBC and Barclays, came as a shock to Patisserie Valerie\u2019s directors and its auditors, Grant Thornton, according to Johnson. The restaurant magnate, who made his name with the \u00a38m purchase and rapid expansion of Pizza Express, has secured a rescue package designed to save Patisserie Valerie, which warned last week it would go under without a significant injection of capital. Under the terms of the deal, Johnson, the company\u2019s largest investor with a 37% stake, will lend it \u00a310m, plus a further short-term \u00a310m bridging loan.

      "bodyText": "It was not only bankers, and central bankers, who got off lightly in the crisis of a decade ago. The group that most successfully stayed out of the spotlight was the auditing profession. Vast financial institutions fell over in a heap, sometimes only months after their books had been signed off as healthy, yet the auditing industry was never seriously held to account. Even when inquiries happened, their findings were mostly banal, and they took years to arrive. The mood now seems to be turning. Sir John Kingman, a former Treasury official who is now chairman of Legal &amp; General, is already conducting a review for government to determine whether the audit watchdog, the Financial Reporting Council, is fit for the future. A heavier battalion arrived this week in the form of the Competition and Markets Authority, which launched a inquiry into concerns that the audit market is not working well for the economy or investors. Encouragingly, the CMA says it will move quickly: provisional findings are promised by Christmas. One trigger was the collapse of Carillion in January this year, which touched a nerve in the way bank failures never did. And a succession of scandals with auditing failures at their heart have played a role. BHS, over which PwC copped a \u00a36.5m fine from the FRC, was a prime example. Further questions will be raised after the crisis that has engulfed Patisserie Valerie \u2013 audited by Grant Thornton \u2013 last week. The CMA is a competition watchdog, and competition is definitely the place to start. Four firms \u2013 PwC, Deloitte, EY and KPMG \u2013 enjoy a dominance that would be tolerated in few other sectors. They audit 99 of the 100 biggest quoted companies and have a combined market share of 98% of FTSE 350 firms \u2013 a reasonable definition of a oligopoly. This concentration isn\u2019t new, which is why in 2013 the CMA\u2019s predecessor, the Competition Commission, ordered companies to put their audit engagements out to tender every 10 years. But the reform has proved useless in generating competition from new quarters. The auditing merry-go-round turns at greater speed but the big four are still the only players aboard. Grant Thornton, the fifth-biggest firm, has now given up pitching for audit contracts from FTSE 350 companies because of the expense of coming second. There is no painless way to smash this dominance, but caps on market share would be an obvious solution. The drawback could be higher prices for audit contracts, but responsible shareholders might be happy to pay more, since the deep suspicion is that dominance has bred complacency among the big four. Life just seems too comfortable for them. That the quality of audit work has fallen is almost beyond dispute. In June, the FRC said standards had slipped at all four of the major outfits. It highlighted \u201ca failure to challenge management and show appropriate scepticism\u201d. Carillion\u2019s auditor, KPMG, was put in the regulatory equivalent of special measures after being singled out as showing \u201can unacceptable deterioration\u201d in the quality of its work. Against such a backdrop, the CMA must be prepared to be bold. It should ignore the squeals from the big four that separating auditing from non-auditing work would be too complex. If the watchdog judges that separation would raise standards, it should make it happen: difficult tasks can be worthwhile. And the CMA should definitely pursue the idea that incentives are misaligned because it\u2019s the boards of companies, rather than their investors, that pick the auditor. Handing powers of appointment to owners, to the people who most want to see sceptical auditors, would be an interesting innovation. Andrew Tyrie, the CMA\u2019s new chairman, picked over the bones of the banking catastrophe when he was an MP and chair of the Treasury select committee. He was commendably withering about some of the failures he uncovered and unafraid to challenge vested interests. More of that, please. EU should not push Salvini to the limit Enter the Forum in Rome and you step back in time. And, like so many politicians, Matteo Salvini wants to time-travel back to an age when European economies grew quickly and the people got richer every year. This week Salvini, the far-right deputy leader of Italy\u2019s ruling coalition, will preside over a rule-busting budget that seems innocuous at first glance \u2013 it only proposes a 2% deficit in the coming year \u2013 but nonetheless breaks the European Union\u2019s deficit rules. Brussels will examine the details of the budget over the following two weeks and probably ask for revisions. At this point, unless someone has succeeded in bringing down the political temperature, Salvini and prime minister Giuseppe Conte will probably declare war on Brussels and dare Eurocrats to stop them. Salvini\u2019s economic problem is that the budget is a cobbled-together wish list masquerading as a coherent boost to productivity, GDP growth and household incomes. It is a long time since Italy\u2019s economy grew at a pace that brought down its debt-to-GDP level; at 131%, it ranks as the worst EU nation bar Greece. Extra spending has the potential to kickstart the economy, as Salvini expects, but Italians have a habit of mistrusting politicians and their promises. When extra cash comes their way, they save it rather than spend. More immediately, the ratings agencies are waiting in the wings to downgrade Rome\u2019s debt mountain and make it more costly to service. A downgrade could come only weeks after the EU says no. Still there is pressure on both sides. Brussels has taken a hard line so far. That looks like inflaming the situation just when tense Brexit negotiations are at their zenith, which seems unwise. Yes, Salvini\u2019s government is distasteful: but it is a duly elected administration and should be listened to. Cost-cutting could spell disaster for energy firms The millions of people who have seen their energy bills raised repeatedly in the past two years will take some comfort in the news that profits at the big six energy firms dropped by 10% over the last year. But while that is a big fall for a single year, these companies still made \u00a3900m profit from supplying people with the essentials of electricity and gas. And though the average profit margin, of 4.2%, is down slightly, the reality is that the profitability of the big six has stayed broadly stable over the past seven years, ranging between 2.8% and 4.5%. To focus on the average would also be to miss the fact that some companies, such as British Gas, are making a stonking margin of 8%. It\u2019s worth remembering that these profits flow from a business model which relies on exploiting the inertia of people who fail to shop around, who are usually society\u2019s poorest, oldest and least-educated. While switching figures are at record highs, there is still a huge rump of people who do not move. A third of customers cannot recall ever switching, Ofgem found last week. While the government\u2019s price cap will not fix the energy market, and is far from perfect, there is little doubt that it will cut the big six\u2019s profits. All of the large players\u2019 default tariffs come in above the \u00a31,136 cap, based on an annual dual-fuel bill with typical consumption. With few options available, most of the companies will probably try to cut their costs to preserve profit margins, which could potentially knock their customer service. But that approach could spell disaster in the longer run. With customer service a priority for consumers, and the firms already losing thousands of customers, the big six can ill afford an exodus sparked by threadbare call centres.",

      "bodyText": "The safest course of action after a humiliating defeat at the hands of your own shareholders is to duck below the parapet and get on with your day job. Unfortunately for Unilever, maker of household staples from Dove soap to Hellmann\u2019s mayonnaise, keeping a low profile isn\u2019t going to be an option for at least another week. Chief executive Paul Polman scrapped plans last month to simplify the company\u2019s Anglo-Dutch legal structure and transplant headquarters from London to Rotterdam, a move that would have seen its shares depart the FTSE 100. City shareholders, many of whom would have been forced to remove Unilever and its steady returns from their portfolios as a result, opposed the plan and were not shy about saying so. Polman duly caved, in but the highly public contretemps with investors left some observers questioning his future in the post he has occupied for nearly a decade. Now might be the time to keep quiet and concentrate on performance but instead Unilever will find itself back in the public eye, giving evidence alongside Royal Mail at a select committee session on executive pay on Tuesday then, two days later, presenting interim results. The first of these could prove a bruising encounter for Unilever, given the predisposition among MPs to use select committees to indulge in gleeful grandstanding. The company recently tweaked its pay structure, swapping it for one that would allow it to pay bigger bonuses and award chunkier pay rises. This change was approved against stiff opposition last May, and Polman \u2013 who could pocket nearly \u00a313m under the new scheme \u2013 could do without it being dredged up by headline-hungry politicians. He\u2019s probably looking to Thursday for a chance to silence his critics \u2013 or at least muffle them temporarily \u2013 with a strong set of numbers, even if they\u2019re only for the third quarter. Last time out, quarterly sales growth of 1.9% disappointed investors, and the company that makes Marmite was left promising jam tomorrow, in the form of price rises mitigating increased commodity costs. Analysts at Hargreaves Lansdown are hopeful that Unilever will show something positive to offset what they call the \u201crecent drama\u201d. \u201cProgress in the group\u2019s emerging markets has been a bit sluggish of late, but overall sales growth for the full year is still expected to come in between 3% and 5%,\u201d said equity analyst Nicholas Hyett. \u201cImprovements to operating margins are also due. Next week\u2019s statement will hopefully show Unilever on the right track to hit those targets.\u201d Anything less will add to the worries keeping Polman up at night. In practice, neither the select committee session nor the third-quarter numbers are big enough affairs to further loosen the Dutchman\u2019s grip on the chief executive\u2019s chair. But his position has come under greater scrutiny than ever since the company rebuffed a $143bn bid from Kraft Heinz in February last year. It was a huge bid to spurn, and the decision forced Unilever to make overtures to investors, showing them that it was not resting on its laurels. The result was a flurry of moves to unlock greater value, most notably the sale of its spreads business \u2013 including Flora and I Can\u2019t Believe It\u2019s Not Butter \u2013 to KKR for \u00a36bn at the end of last year. The company has also cut costs to boost margins, bought back shares and increased dividends. All well and good, but disgruntlement over pay and the failure of Polman\u2019s Rotterdam gambit have detracted from these efforts. What Unilever needs now is a period out of the spotlight, allowing Polman and co to lick their wounds. Negative publicity has a way of gathering a momentum all of its own.",

      "bodyText": "Is it safe to order online at the \u201cnew\u201d House of Fraser, now owned by Sports Direct? One customer who bought \u00a3380 of goods has found himself in a similar ordeal to the thousands of unhappy customers who lost out when the \u201cold\u201d company went into administration. Harps Singh, from Birmingham, paid \u00a3380 for three pairs of designer jeans in late September, just days after the store relaunched its website. They arrived as expected, but as they were not suitable he decided to return them. He presumed his parcel would be accepted back and his \u00a3380 refunded. But he has been told by Royal Mail that it is among the thousands of other parcels stacked up in a Wellingborough warehouse full of goods returned by customers of the \u201cold\u201d House of Fraser, which the company is refusing to refund. His repeated requests that his refund be processed have drawn no response. He has been told he can\u2019t return the items to a store, as staff have been told not to process web-order refunds. Singh must have been one of the first people to use the relaunched website, which was offline for about a month after Sports Direct\u2019s Mike Ashley\u2019s controversial buyout. At the time, Ashley pledged the store would become \u201cthe Harrods of the high street\u201d. Singh says: \u201cI\u2019d always been a happy House of Fraser customer, and fortunately wasn\u2019t one of those caught up in the collapse. I was happy to pay the new delivery charges because it meant I didn\u2019t have to go shopping, but now I discover my returned items can\u2019t be found among a sea of parcels. \u201cNo one can tell me what\u2019s going on \u2013 it\u2019s ridiculous. I certainly won\u2019t be ordering again any time soon, and others who were thinking of doing the same need to be aware of what\u2019s going on there.\u201d The original department store\u2019s \u00a31bn collapse left thousands of consumers out of pocket. Many had placed orders for items that were not delivered, and unwittingly became creditors of the old company. The Observer understands that there may be better news for the 25,000 holders of the original House of Fraser gift cards. After the takeover, House of Fraser asked card holders to send in their cards, promising a replacement. Some of these have also been returned unopened, and most customers assumed they had lost their money \u2013 in some cases as much as \u00a3750. This week, it emerged that some customers have received letters telling them they will be issued with replacement e-vouchers that will be valid until 31 January 2019. Further gift cards can be sent back until Wednesday 31 October, it states. The company has, typically, made no formal statement. Signs in stores state that the company is only accepting Post Office, One4all gift cards and House of Fraser reward vouchers. Furious customers have taken to social media to vent their frustration at the lack of information. Several longstanding clients have had enough and promised they will never shop in the chain again. The company had originally promised to refund customers who had online orders cancelled and then reneged on that offer. Last week, the firm\u2019s former directors and senior managers were sacked. Yvonne Fovargue MP, who chairs the all-party parliamentary group on consumer protection, says the debacle has demonstrated the need for a consumer ombudsman with \u201creal teeth\u201d. She adds: \u201cMike Ashley made a number of promises to customers when he bought the business last month, and these should be honoured. He certainly has a legal duty to fulfil, or at least refund, orders placed since he took over. His silence here is unacceptable.\u201d When contacted by the Observer, House of Fraser told us: \u201cOur website is now functioning normally and we are not aware of any significant backlog of returns relating to orders made after 10 August. If customers experience any isolated issues, we recommend they contact customer services in the normal way.\u201d Paying again for a paid-for item A House of Fraser customer who paid the last instalment on a \u00a31,280 sofa on the day the company collapsed \u2013 and was told he\u2019d lost his money \u2013 has described his shock at being called last week by the store and asked if he wanted to buy the sofa they\u2019d refused to supply for a discounted \u00a3750. James Mohan was told he would have to join the long queue of creditors with only the slimmest chance of seeing any of his money again. When his wife gave birth to their first child there was no sofa to sit on and no money to buy another. \u201cThe salesman told me they had called other customers and the majority of people do actually repurchase an item they have already paid for,\u201d he says. \u201cIt seems a despicable way to do business.\u201d Mohan was lucky in that he had paid the final \u00a36 instalment with his Asda credit card. This enabled him to claim the \u00a31,280 back from the card provider \u2013 Creation Financial Services \u2013 using section 75 of the Consumer Credit Act. House of Fraser denied it had been calling customers in this way and said the call must have come from a supplier \u201cwho was tying to be helpful\u201d. Anna Tims",
