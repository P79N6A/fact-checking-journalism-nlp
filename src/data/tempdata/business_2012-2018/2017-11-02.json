      "bodyText": "The controversy over workers being being pushed into \u201cdubious\u201d self-employment has been reignited, with a parliamentary committee accusing a leisure group of \u201cegregious\u201d use of such contracts. The move comes as the ride-hailing firm Uber awaits a decision on its appeal against a landmark employment tribunal judgment last year, which ruled that the company\u2019s drivers are not self-employed and should be paid the national living wage. Apart from having no entitlement to minimum levels of pay, self-employed workers do not receive other employment benefits, such as paid holidays. The Uber case has been pounced on by critics, who argue that companies are increasingly exploiting such loopholes, particularly in the so-called gig economy. On Thursday, parliament\u2019s work and pensions committee said it had written to The Gym Group, an operator of 89 \u201clow-cost\u201d UK gyms, questioning why its contracts classify its personal trainers as self-employed when it places restrictions on what they can charge clients and when they can take holidays. Frank Field MP, the committee chair, said: \u201cThis contract from Gym Group is the latest in a long line of examples highlighting dubious self-employed workforce models and it is one of the most egregious examples I\u2019ve seen to date. It is packed full of clauses that clearly suggest Gym Group\u2019s \u2018freelance independent personal trainers\u2019 are nothing of the sort, but are in fact workers entitled to the rights and protections that come with that status. \u201cI look forward to receiving Gym Group\u2019s explanation of this state of affairs. But even more importantly, this contract, and the other examples we\u2019ve received, demonstrate that the current system for protecting and enforcing workers\u2019 rights is failing.\u201d The Gym Group said: \u201cWe take the feedback of our self-employed personal trainers who we partner with extremely seriously and we will be happy to cooperate and respond in full to the issues raised by the requested deadline of 10 November. Beyond that we have no further comment at this stage.\u201d Also on Thursday, the union Unite served a claim against ADR Network Limited, a temporary employment agency that supplies drivers in the logistics sector, and its holding company PPF Limited, on behalf of Gary Sharrock, a self-employed driver engaged by the firms. The union argues Sharrock had to set up his own company to be awarded work by the firm, despite his job being the same as those employed as workers by the company. Howard Beckett, Unite assistant general secretary for legal services, said the agency is using \u201cbogus self-employment to avoid the basic right to holiday pay\u201d, and accused ADR of \u201ca brazen attempt\u201d to circumvent the Agency Worker Regulations, which require agencies to pay temporary workers the same rates as a business\u2019s employed workforce. ADR Network and PPF said they believed the claim is \u201cwithout merit\u201d and that they would be \u201cvigorously\u201d defending it.",

      "bodyText": "Millions of homeowners face higher mortgage payments after the Bank of England said it could no longer tolerate the inflation level and announced the first increase in interest rates in more than 10 years. Despite weak growth and mounting uncertainty over the terms of Britain\u2019s exit from the EU, Threadneedle Street increased interest rates to 0.5% from 0.25% on Thursday, reversing emergency action taken immediately after the Brexit vote. The move will add \u00a322 a month to the costs of servicing the average variable rate mortgage, although the recent popularity of fixed-rate home loans means it will initially affect only 43% of home buyers. Mark Carney, the Bank\u2019s governor, said it was time \u201cto ease our foot off the accelerator\u201d but sought to reassure consumers and businesses that the first increase in rates since July 2007 was not the start of a sustained upward trend. He said: \u201cTo be clear, even after today\u2019s rate increase, monetary policy will provide significant support to jobs and activity. And the monetary policy committee continues to expect that any future increases in interest rates would be at a gradual pace and to a limited extent.\u201d As things stand, Threadneedle Street is expecting two further quarter-point increases in interest rates by the turn of the decade, which would leave them at 1%. The Bank said that the financial crisis and deep recession of a decade ago had permanently damaged the economy\u2019s growth potential. Brexit had further reduced the \u201cspeed limit\u201d at which the UK could operate without generating higher inflation, Carney said. Still, the rate decision sparked sharp questions over the ability of consumers to repay loans amid rising use of personal borrowing and credit cards to offset higher prices. Households are, in total, expected to face about \u00a31.8bn in additional interest payments on variable rate mortgages in the first year alone, according to analysis by the accountancy firm Moore Stephens. The firm also estimates that households will pay as much as \u00a3465m in additional costs on credit cards, overdrafts, personal loans and car finance. The Bank faced criticism for the timing of its decision due to weak readings on the economy and a lack of clarity from the Brexit talks. The TUC\u2019s general secretary, Frances O\u2019Grady, said: \u201cThis is the last thing hard-pressed families need. With living standards falling, the economy needs boosting not reining in.\u201d David Blanchflower, a former member of the MPC, criticised the rate rise and said it would be reversed. \u201cThis is guessonomics. There is nothing in the data to sustain this rise,\u201d he said. Despite the prospect of higher costs for borrowers, the interest rate rise will prove a boon for savers if banks match Threadneedle Street\u2019s increase with a jump in the interest paid on deposits. Theresa May\u2019s spokesman said the government expected to see higher rates passed on to savers. Some banks have already said they will increase rates on their savings as well as put up the repayments demanded from borrowers, including Royal Bank of Scotland and TSB. The move by Threadneedle Street comes amid a squeeze on households\u2019 living standards from rising prices, outstripping the growth in earnings, following the devaluation of the pound since the EU referendum. It hopes that will offset the increase in borrowing costs. Carney said \u201cthe worst of the real income squeeze is ending\u201d, adding that higher interest rates were \u201cpart of ensuring that it does not come back\u201d. About a third of households have a mortgage on a home, according to the Bank. In aggregate, mortgage debt represents about three-quarters of the overall stock of household debt. Fixed-rate mortgages by value have also risen significantly in recent years, to about 60% of the stock of mortgages, which the central bank said meant that the impact of the rate hike would only feed through to households gradually. Vince Cable, the Liberal Democrat leader, said higher rates presented \u201ca serious problem as many individuals, families and companies rely increasingly on borrowing to get by\u201d. There have been some signs of consumers using savings or borrowing money from banks or on credit cards to keep up with day-to-day spending in recent months. However, high-street sales are falling at their fastest rate since the height of the recession as consumers tighten their belts. Pushing up the cost of servicing debts, \u201cwill kick one of the few parts of the economy that was working\u201d, Cable added.",

    "webTitle": "Trump names Jay Powell to replace Janet Yellen as Fed chief", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Donald Trump named Jerome \u201cJay\u201d Powell as the new head of the Federal Reserve, the world\u2019s most powerful central banker, on Thursday. \u201cHe\u2019s strong, he\u2019s committed, he\u2019s smart,\u201d Trump said, introducing his appointment in a short address outside the White House. Powell praised his predecessors, Janet Yellen and Ben Bernanke. He thanked the president for the \u201cextraordinary opportunity\u201d and said he was \u201ccommitted to making the best decisions based on the best available evidence in the longstanding tradition of monetary independence\u201d. Trump\u2019s pick differs little from the current chair, Yellen, in his economic views. He is, however, less qualified, male and, in line with Trump\u2019s penchant for appointing members of the 1%, far, far richer. Powell, a current member of the Federal Reserve board, had been widely tipped as Trump\u2019s choice but the president teased the appointment as if announcing a new reality TV show. \u201cPeople are anxiously awaiting my decision about who the next head of the Fed will be,\u201d Trump said on an Instagram video last week. \u201cI have somebody very specific in mind. I think everybody will be very impressed.\u201d Trump even took an informal poll of Republican senators asking them to raise a hand for Powell or for John Taylor, another candidate and a Stanford economist who has been highly critical of the Fed\u2019s low interest rate policy. (\u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s a very good way to pick a Fed chair, so I declined to participate,\u201d Senator Bob Corker of Tennessee, a frequent Trump critic, told the New York Times.) At the same time Trump built tension by hinting that Yellen could stay on. \u201cI think she\u2019s terrific. We had a great talk,\u201d Trump told Fox Business last week. \u201cIn one way I have to say, you like to make your own mark, which is maybe one of things that she\u2019s got a little bit against her.\u201d If confirmed Powell will succeed Yellen in February, when her four-year term as Fed chief expires. While the decision goes against precedent \u2013 since the second world war, every Fed chair who completed a first term has been nominated for a second \u2013 Powell is not a change candidate. An Obama appointee, whom the former president called \u201ctremendously qualified\u201d, Powell has consistently voted with Yellen to keep rates low and only raise them cautiously. But in some ways Powell is an unusual pick. A lawyer by training, he graduated from Georgetown and was editor-in-chief of the Georgetown Law Journal, and would be the first Fed chairman in three decades without a PhD in economics. Yellen has a PhD in economics from Yale and taught at Harvard and the LSE before serving as chair of Bill Clinton\u2019s council of economics. From there, she went on to head the San Francisco Fed before Obama appointed her as the first woman to head the central bank. Before joining the Fed board, Powell made a fortune working as an investment banker for the Carlyle Group and is the richest member of the Fed\u2019s board with a fortune estimated between $21.3m and $72.2m, according to disclosure forms, making him the richest member of the Fed\u2019s board. Powell and Yellen might have very different backgrounds but they have been in broad agreement on economic policy. Both consistently voted to keep interest rates low and to raise them only gradually as the economy escaped the clutches of the great recession. Powell has voted in favor of every Fed policy decision since his appointment in 2012. Regulation may be one area where Powell will differ from Yellen. True to his Republican roots, Powell has intimated he would like to loosen the government\u2019s grip on the financial sector.

(\u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s a very good way to pick a Fed chair, so I declined to participate,\u201d Senator Bob Corker of Tennessee, a frequent Trump critic, told <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/27/us/politics/trump-fed-chairman.html?_r=0\">the New York Times</a>.)</p> <p>At the same time Trump built tension by hinting that Yellen could stay on. \u201cI think she\u2019s terrific. We had a great talk,\u201d Trump told Fox Business last week. \u201cIn one way I have to say, you like to make your own mark, which is maybe one of things that she\u2019s got a little bit against her.\u201d</p> <p>If confirmed Powell will succeed Yellen in February, when her four-year term as Fed chief expires.</p> <p>While the decision goes against precedent \u2013 since the second world war, every Fed chair who completed a first term has been nominated for a second \u2013 Powell is not a change candidate. An Obama appointee, whom the former president called \u201ctremendously qualified\u201d, Powell has consistently voted with Yellen to keep rates low and only raise them cautiously.</p> <p>But in some ways Powell is an unusual pick. A lawyer by training, he graduated from Georgetown and was editor-in-chief of the Georgetown Law Journal, and would be the first Fed chairman in three decades without a PhD in economics.</p> <p>Yellen has a PhD in economics from Yale and taught at Harvard and the LSE before serving as chair of Bill Clinton\u2019s council of economics. From there, she went on to head the San Francisco Fed before Obama appointed her as the first woman to head the central bank.</p> <p>Before joining the Fed board, Powell made a fortune working as an investment banker for the Carlyle Group and is the richest member of the Fed\u2019s board with a fortune estimated between $21.3m and $72.2m, according to disclosure forms, making him the richest member of the Fed\u2019s board.</p> <p>Powell and Yellen might have very different backgrounds but they have been in broad agreement on economic policy. Both consistently voted to keep interest rates low and to raise them only gradually as the economy escaped the clutches of the great recession. Powell has voted in favor of every Fed policy decision since his appointment in 2012.</p> <p>Regulation may be one area where Powell will differ from Yellen. True to his Republican roots, Powell has intimated he would like to loosen the government\u2019s grip on the financial sector.</p> <p>In June, Powell told the Senate he was cautiously looking at how regulators could streamline the Volcker rule, regulations brought in after the financial crisis to prevent making overly risky bets like the ones that caused the crisis.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t think what we\u2019re talking about here amounts to broad deregulation,\u201d Powell said. \u201cI think it amounts to making regulation more efficient, protecting the important gains we\u2019ve made [since the financial crisis].

      "bodyText": "Ferrari is on course to rake in a record \u20ac1bn (\u00a3766m) profit this year as the world\u2019s wealthy buy more supercars than ever before. Sergio Marchionne, the company\u2019s chief executive, said on Thursday that Ferrari\u2019s adjusted profits for the first nine months of 2017 were up 24% and that the firm was on track to meet its target of \u20ac1bn annual profit two years ahead of target. Ferrari, which this week revealed a new racetrack-only FXX K Evo hypercar, has sold 6,381 cars so far this year, a 5% increase on the same period in 2016. The company\u2019s strong performance follows that of other luxury car brands as demand for the most expensive limited edition models increases. Worldwide sales of Bentleys, Ferraris, Lamborghinis, McLarens and Rolls-Royces have collectively increased by 51% over the past five years, according to research by Bloomberg Intelligence. The five brands sold 30,000 cars between them last year. There are now 36,220 supercars registered on UK roads, a 40% increase since 2013, according to analysis of Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA) data by the car website Motorway.co.uk. The increase in high-end car sales comes as the overall UK car market is on course for the first annual decline since 2011. New car registrations dropped by 9.3% in September, the first time crucial new numberplate sales had dropped in six years. The Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders blamed declining consumer confidence over Brexit for the decline. Alex Buttle, director of Motorway.co.uk, said: \u201cWhile many of these cars head overseas, our research shows that lots are being bought by wealthy UK customers, so don\u2019t be surprised to see more Bentleys, Aston Martins and Ferraris parked up on double-yellow [lines] in years to come.\u201d HR Owen, the British luxury car dealership, reported a 78% increase in pre-tax profits this week to \u00a32.9m on sales up 20% to \u00a3428m in the year to April 2017. The dealer, the world\u2019s largest retailer of Rolls-Royce, Bentley and Bugatti brands, sold 1,306 new prestige cars, a 33% increase on the previous year. Secondhand car sales also increased from 1,764 to 1,849. The growing appetite among wealthy people for luxury cars comes as research shows that the super-rich hold the greatest concentration of wealth since the US \u201cgilded age\u201d at the turn of the 20th century, when families such as the Carnegies, Rockefellers and Vanderbilts controlled vast fortunes. Billionaires increased their combined global wealth by almost a fifth last year to a record $6tn (\u00a34.5tn), according to the UBS/PwC Billionaires report. Ferrari has set out out plans to introduce more limited edition models this year to celebrate its 70th anniversary. The company\u2019s shares have more than doubled since it floated on the stock market two years ago. Almost 80% of Rolls-Royce cars are now customised to buyers demands, which adds an average of 20% to the sale price.",

      "bodyText": "You wait 10 years for a rise in interest rates and, when the moment finally arrives, the timing feels completely arbitrary. An easier moment to make the move would have been the start of this year. The August 2016 cut from 0.5% to 0.25% was presented as an emergency measure to prevent a post-referendum recession. When the downturn didn\u2019t arrive \u2013 GDP growth in the final quarter of 2016 was a strong 0.7% \u2013 it would have been logical to revert to 0.5%. The Bank of England could have declared a minor victory and said it would remain vigilant on all fronts, looking for both inflationary breezes and Brexit headwinds. Instead, Mark Carney &amp; Co delayed and then, sometime in the summer, decided the ground had to be prepared for a return to 0.5%. By September, the hints had become heavy as inflation edged towards 3%. Pleasingly for the Bank, the pound strengthened in anticipation of interest-rate action. Now we\u2019re in November and the medium-term outlook has shifted again. The Brexit effects that didn\u2019t appear a year ago are now apparent. Business investment is sluggish and consumer confidence is low. Meanwhile, the summer\u2019s inflation worries look less serious. The year-on-year effects of a lower pound are being diluted with time. There is little evidence that workers are securing higher wages while their bosses are transfixed by the Brexit drama and the question of when, or even if, a transitional deal with the EU will be secured. Yet the Bank has pushed the button anyway. The UK is thus in the very odd position of cutting rates a year ago to deal with a Brexit whack that didn\u2019t happen, but now raising rates when the Brexit risks to the economy feel more real and immediate. Confused? The market is. The pound is now lower against the dollar than it was in September. Several explanations are possible, including the shambolic state of the government. But the most credible is that investors think the Bank talked itself into a corner and has now made the wrong move. BT investors are worried about the future \u201cOur progressive dividend policy remains unchanged,\u201d proclaimed the BT chief executive, Gavin Patterson, several times on Thursday, skipping over the fact that he radically revised his definition of progress as recently as May. BT used to shoot for rises of 10% or more a year. Now any increase, or even a flat dividend, will do. Still, an unchanged policy must mean the commitment is clear and solid, right? Unfortunately not, as a still-falling share price indicates. On the clarity front, City analysts leaped on a nuance in BT\u2019s wording \u2013 and were right to do so. \u201cOur first priority for the allocation of free cashflow is value-enhancing reinvestment in our business,\u201d said BT. That sounds sensibly bland but it means post-investment cash is merely \u201cavailable to support\u201d other priorities, like dividends and the pension fund, where the deficit was \u00a37.7bn at the last count. Therein lies the worry about solidity. Two big pressures on BT\u2019s cash flows, currently worth \u00a32.8bn or so a year, are obvious. First, Ofcom is pushing for the Openreach subsidiary to direct more investment at superfast fibre that actually goes to premises, as opposed to stopping at the end of road and using copper wires for the last leg. The regulator\u2019s idea of how costs should be shared around the industry may not match BT\u2019s. Second, many of BT\u2019s cash-generating engines are misfiring. The global services division, which supplies IT and telephony services to multinationals, suffered a 10% drop in revenues in the second quarter and its top-line profits were 39% weaker. Meanwhile, the expensively assembled TV business added only 7,000 new customers and the next football rights auction may feature pitch-invaders such as Amazon. The only true bright point within an overall 1.5% fall in group revenues was the mobile business, EE. Two years ago, BT\u2019s revenues were growing at 2% and the alleged fraud in Italy, which knocked a hole in last year\u2019s figures, hadn\u2019t yet happened. The share price in those days was 480p. Now it is 254p, which is a mighty come-down. A dividend yield of 6% sends a straightforward signal: investors fear a dividend cut coming. The concern is not about this year but next, which is when the size of the competing claims from pensions, fibre and sports rights will be clearer. On the current evidence, investors are right to worry. Patterson\u2019s \u201cprogressive\u201d dividend describes an ambition. He has yet to set out a detailed plan of how it can be achieved.",

Pleasingly for the Bank, the pound strengthened in anticipation of interest-rate action.</p> \n<p>Now we\u2019re in November and the medium-term outlook has shifted again. The Brexit effects that didn\u2019t appear a year ago are now apparent. Business investment is sluggish and consumer confidence is low. Meanwhile, the summer\u2019s inflation worries look less serious. The year-on-year effects of a lower pound are being diluted with time. There is little evidence that workers are securing higher wages while their bosses are transfixed by the Brexit drama and the question of when, or even if, a transitional deal with the EU will be secured.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"5cabd7be-b5eb-47dd-abff-1cb3bed9e36e\" data-atom-type=\"qanda\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Qanda\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Lenders have already bumped up the cost of fixed rate mortgages ahead of the Bank of England\u2019s decision to raise base rate from 0.25% to 0.5%, and mortgage borrowers on tracker and variable rates will see their monthly payments become more expensive in the coming days.&nbsp;\u200b</p>\n    <p>Savers will gain as banks and building societies improve the rates available on deposit and Isa accounts, although increases are unlikely to come for several weeks.</p>\n    <p>How much consumers and businesses cut back on spending and investment in the face of higher rates will depend on signals from the Bank about the trend for future increases.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Yet the Bank has pushed the button anyway. The UK is thus in the very odd position of cutting rates a year ago to deal with a Brexit whack that didn\u2019t happen, but now raising rates when the Brexit risks to the economy feel more real and immediate.</p> \n<p>Confused? The market is. The pound is now lower against the dollar than it was in September. Several explanations are possible, including the shambolic state of the government. But the most credible is that investors think the Bank talked itself into a corner and has now made the wrong move.</p> \n<h2>BT investors are worried about the future</h2> \n<p>\u201cOur progressive dividend policy remains unchanged,\u201d proclaimed the BT chief executive, Gavin Patterson, several times on Thursday, skipping over the fact that he radically revised his definition of progress as recently as May. BT used to shoot for rises of 10% or more a year. Now any increase, or even a flat dividend, will do.</p> \n<p>Still, an unchanged policy must mean the commitment is clear and solid, right? Unfortunately not, as a still-falling share price indicates.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/oct/26/bt-to-slash-landline-charges-for-1m-customers\">BT to slash landline charges for 1 million customers</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>On the clarity front, City analysts leaped on a nuance in BT\u2019s wording \u2013 and were right to do so. \u201cOur first priority for the allocation of free cashflow is value-enhancing reinvestment in our business,\u201d said BT. That sounds sensibly bland but it means post-investment cash is merely \u201cavailable to support\u201d other priorities, like dividends and the pension fund, where the deficit was \u00a37.7bn at the last count.</p> \n<p>Therein lies the worry about solidity. Two big pressures on BT\u2019s cash flows, currently worth \u00a32.8bn or so a year, are obvious. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jul/26/bt-avoids-openreach-breakup-ofcom-orders-more-investment\">First, Ofcom is pushing for the Openreach subsidiary to direct more investment at superfast fibre that actually goes to premises, as opposed to stopping at the end of road and using copper wires for the last leg</a>. The regulator\u2019s idea of how costs should be shared around the industry may not match BT\u2019s.</p> \n<p>Second, many of BT\u2019s cash-generating engines are misfiring. The global services division, which supplies IT and telephony services to multinationals, suffered a 10% drop in revenues in the second quarter and its top-line profits were 39% weaker. Meanwhile, the expensively assembled TV business added only 7,000 new customers and the next football rights auction may feature pitch-invaders such as Amazon. The only true bright point within an overall 1.5% fall in group revenues was the mobile business, EE.</p> \n<p>Two years ago, BT\u2019s revenues were growing at 2% and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/jan/24/bt-loses-7bn-in-value-as-italian-accounting-scandal-deepens\">the alleged fraud in Italy</a>, which knocked a hole in last year\u2019s figures, hadn\u2019t yet happened. The share price in those days was 480p. Now it is 254p, which is a mighty come-down. A dividend yield of 6% sends a straightforward signal: investors fear a dividend cut coming. The concern is not about this year but next, which is when the size of the competing claims from pensions, fibre and sports rights will be clearer.</p> \n<p>On the current evidence, investors are right to worry. Patterson\u2019s \u201cprogressive\u201d dividend describes an ambition. He has yet to set out a detailed plan of how it can be achieved.</p> \n<p></p> \n<p></p> \n<p> </p>",

The case at Southwark crown court relates to an alleged hole in Tesco\u2019s accounts revealed in September 2014 when the company told the stock market it had overestimated profits by about \u00a3250m. Dave Lewis was pulled out of a meeting on 19 September 2014 and asked to go straight to the office of Adrian Morris, Tesco\u2019s top lawyer, where he was handed the so-called \u201clegacy paper\u201d which had been prepared by Amit Soni, an employee in Tesco\u2019s finance department, and another member of his team. \u201cI read it quickly and then very carefully a second time,\u201d said Lewis of the secret report. \u201cI had never experienced anything like this before and having read the paper I felt it had to be taken very seriously.\u201d Carl Rogberg, the former finance director of Tesco UK, John Scouler, the former commercial director for food, and Christopher Bush, the former managing director of Tesco UK, have all been charged with one count of fraud by abuse of position and one count of false accounting. The three deny any wrongdoing and have pleaded not guilty. Last month Soni told the court that in 2014 Tesco staff were under pressure to hit \u201cinsurmountable\u201d financial targets. The accountant had become increasingly concerned about the use of a process called \u201cpull forward\u201d \u2013 in which income from suppliers that should have been recognised in future years was recorded early to help the company hit targets. Prosecutor Sasha Wass QC asked Lewis what his immediate reaction had been to the report, to which he replied: \u201cOne of surprise and one of shock really.\u201d \u201cWhat was new was the proposition here that \u00a3246m of income had been included in the first half of the year that on that basis of this paper was deemed to be questionable,\u201d he continued. \u201cYou don\u2019t need to be a lawyer or an accountant to know that the accusation in here of not recognising income and costs in the right period is a significant problem.\u201d The prosecution has described the report reaching Lewis as being \u201clike a hand grenade had been thrown into the company\u201d and he described the frenetic weekend of activity that followed which included two board meetings on the Sunday. Lewis said he called Sir Richard Broadbent immediately and that the company\u2019s then chairman agreed to fly home from his holiday in Italy. The company also called in a team of forensic accountants and lawyers to scrutinise its books so as to assess the report\u2019s veracity. On the Monday the company told the stock exchange of the hole in its profits \u2013 a revelation that would wipe more than \u00a32bn off the company\u2019s value in a single day and plunge the company into the worst crisis in its near 100-year history.

      "bodyText": "The Bank of England\u2019s 0.25% rate rise sent the pound tumbling on foreign exchanges as gloomy forecasts for growth appeared to rule out the prospect of steep increases in the cost of credit before 2020. Sterling dropped more than 1% to $1.30 and the euro climbed by a cent to nearly \u20ac1.12 in response to a signal of a more limited increase in interest rates over the next two years than Threadneedle Street indicated in the summer. Traders sent the FTSE 100 to within a point of its previous record closing high in anticipation of the largest firms list on the stock market reaping the benefits of the lower pound. The market hit 7,555, up almost 1%. \u201cThe FTSE 100 was helped by the plunge in the pound\u201d, said David Madden, a market analyst at CMC Markets. Among FTSE-listed companies that earn much of their income in euros and dollars, miners BHP Billiton, Rio Tinto, Antofagasta rose between 2.4% and 2.7%. Bank officials said they had pressed ahead with the first increase in interest rates for a decade in an attempt to protect British households from inflation that has risen since the Brexit vote. The move was widely expected after a series of speeches in recent months by members of the Bank\u2019s interest rate setting committee in favour of an increase despite a slump in GDP growth and the likelihood that inflation would fall next year without a rate rise. The Bank\u2019s governor, Mark Carney, said inflation was likely to remain close to its 2% target as even modest wage rises forced up prices in the shops. He said the Brexit talks were likely to be the biggest factor for the next move on rates, either up or down. \u201cWe\u2019re going to be in exceptional circumstances for a period of time, certainly until there\u2019s clear resolution of the future relationship [with the EU], and even then, maybe longer than that,\u201d he said. He said the novelty of a first rate hike in 10 years created some uncertainty about its impact on the economy, though there was no reason to expect this to be larger than on previous occasions. The Bank\u2019s central forecast in its November inflation report signalled two more 0.25% percentage point rises in the next two years, capping the base rate at 1% by 2020. Two members of the nine-strong monetary policy committee voted to keep rates at 0.25% - Sir John Cunliffe and Sir Dave Ramsden. They said: \u201cThere was insufficient evidence so far that domestic costs, in particular wage growth, would pick up in line with the inflation report\u2019s central projection\u201d. Alan Clarke, an economist at Scotia Bank, said: \u201cThese comments confirm to us that wage data will be absolutely crucial in the early months of 2018 in dictating how soon the next rate hike can be expected to arrive.\u201d Amit Kara, the head of UK macroeconomic forecasting at the National Institute for Economics &amp; Social Research, said the economy had recovered strongly in the wake of the Brexit vote and justified interest rates reaching 2% by the middle of 2021. He said the low pound would continue to encourage a surge in exports and, with it, an increase in high-priced raw materials, forcing the Bank into a more severe clampdown on inflation. The rise comes after the consumer price index (CPI) measure of inflation hit 3% in September and is expected to rise further, driven by the pound\u2019s fall since the EU referendum. The Bank is mandated to target CPI at 2% to prevent the economy from overheating. Further rises in rates are expected to support the value of the pound, but it also raises borrowing costs for consumers and businesses through increased payments on mortgages and loans. That could curtail consumer spending and make it harder for businesses to borrow to invest, which in turn could clip the rate of economic growth just as Britain requires a shot in the arm during the Brexit process. The MPC noted that business investment was being affected by uncertainties over the country\u2019s withdrawal from the EU. The Bank predicated its forecasts on a smooth adjustment to a new trading relationship, meaning that a hard, disruptive Brexit could throw its plans off course. Threadneedle Street had been warned against increasing interest rates as storm clouds gathered because of rising inflation, weak wage growth and uncertainty over Brexit. High street sales are falling at their fastest rate since the height of the recession as households put the brakes on spending in response to higher prices and sluggish earnings growth. Despite historically weak levels of business investment, the Bank said further growth should come as firms benefit from the weakness in sterling and the global economy picks up pace, providing potential export opportunities for British firms. A higher contribution to GDP growth from exporters could help to offset weaker consumer spending. Fears that Brexit could derail the economy remain a major concern. The Bank found \u201cuncertainties associated with Brexit were weighing on domestic activity, which had slowed even as global growth had risen significantly\u201d. The vote to leave the EU constrained the speed at which the UK could grow before prices began to spiral, according to the Bank, which said that the growth potential of the economy had been clipped below the levels it was able to achieve in previous years. The UK recorded a growth rate of 0.4% in the three months to September, much lower than the US and eurozone during the same period.",

      "bodyText": "The slump in the pound as the Bank of England hinted any further rate rises were not imminent helped push the FTSE 100 just shy of a new record close. Sterling continues to suffer, after Mark Carney insisted that future rate rises would be gradual and limited. It\u2019s currently down 1.8 cents, or 1.3%, against the US dollar at $1.3067 - a very sharp move (especially as interest rates have gone up!) Elsewhere the picture was more mixed, with markets undermined by a rising euro. In the US, Wall Street awaited news of the next Federal Reserve chair and the non-farm payroll numbers on Friday. The closing scores in Europe showed: The FTSE 100 finished up 67.36 points or 0.9% at 7555.32, less than a point below the all time closing high set in mid-October Germany\u2019s Dax dipped 0.18% to 13,440.93 France\u2019s Cac closed 0.07% lower at 5510.50 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB added 0.24% to 23,046.05 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended down 0.47% at 10,457.8 In Greece, the Athens market lost 0.6% to 762.49 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 23 points or 0.1%. On that note, it\u2019s time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. Today\u2019s market reaction to the Bank of England\u2019s rate decision shows how difficult it is to judge how events will be received, says Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown: The market has delivered yet another salutary lesson on why not to invest on the basis of macro-economic events like an interest rate rise. Even if you guess the right outcome, predicting the effect on asset prices is a different ball game. In theory an interest rate rise should be positive for the pound and the banking sector, and negative for gilts and the FTSE 100. Today the pound fell, as did Lloyds and RBS shares, while gilts and the broader Footsie rallied, turning the investment textbook on its head. This is largely because markets wanted more than a rate rise from the Bank of England today, and were pricing in a more hawkish stance on the future path of monetary policy. As things now stand, it looks like we\u2019re only going to get two rate rises in the next three years. Markets therefore have had to retrace their steps and pare back some of the price movements we have seen in misplaced anticipation of a more hawkish Bank of England. Looking forward rates can be expected to rise slowly and gradually, unless there is a very negative, or indeed a very positive, Brexit surprise. That will be supportive of equity markets and continue to offer little protection to cash savers from the ravages of inflation. In other words, not that much has changed. The Economist Intelligence Unit also expects the next UK rate rise to be delayed: The UK interest rate rise should not have a huge impact on the economy, and there is not likely to be another increase in the next year, says ratings agency Fitch: The Bank of England\u2019s (BoE) decision to increase UK interest rates by 25 bp partly unwinds the monetary stimulus it provided last summer, and is unlikely to have a large economic impact. The BoE looks set to tighten policy slowly, but the first UK rate hike in over decade highlights how shrinking output gaps and tighter labour markets are pushing central banks towards interest rate normalisation... Fitch has for some time been expecting the post-referendum interest rate cut to be reversed, although in our most recent Global Economic Outlook (September 2017), we expected this to happen in early 2018. The MPC summary said that all members agreed that future increases \u201cwould be expected to be at a gradual pace and to a limited extent,\u201d and that monetary policy \u201ccontinues to provide significant support to jobs and activity.\u201d We think another increase is unlikely in the next 12 months, given the impact of Brexit uncertainty on the outlook for investment. Today\u2019s decision does not alter our UK growth forecasts , which see a net trade boost partially offsetting slower domestic demand this year, enabling real GDP to rise by 1.5%, before slowing to 1.3% next year. But it remains to be seen how firms and households adjust to a shift in the monetary policy stance after such a long period without a rate rise. The full Fitch statement is here.

You can sign up here. The FTSE 100 has closed, and it didn\u2019t quite make a new record. The index is up 0.9% at 7555.32, less than a point below its all time closing high set on 12 October. The fall in sterling of course has provided the support for the index, with the pound down 1.4% against the dollar and 1.7% against the euro. The pound has been falling on the basis that the Bank of England\u2019s rate rise is a dovish one, and further increases are not likely in the near term. But Capital Economics believes the markets may be underestimating the situation: We continue to think that the markets are underestimating how quickly rates will rise in the UK, though, as the economy weathers the uncertainty over Brexit well. Only one further 25bp increase is discounted in the overnight indexed swap (OIS) market between now and the end of 2018, whereas we anticipate that there will be three \u2013 taking Bank Rate to 1.25%. Admittedly, investors might be anticipating rather more tightening next year than is implied by OIS rates. This is because the future overnight rates implied by these financial market instruments include term premiums, which may be negative. But there is probably still a substantial difference between investors\u2019 and our own expectations for Bank Rate. For this reason we think that UK monetary policy will provide some renewed support to sterling before long. The continuing fall in the pound has re-energised the FTSE 100, which is packed full of overseas earners who should benefit from a weaker sterling. The leading index is now up 0.8% at 7553, and while that is well below the intra-day peak of 7598, it is not far off the record close of 7556. And there is only another half an hour or so of trading to go. It\u2019s not getting any better for the pound. It is now at a three and a half week low against the dollar, and on track for its biggest one day fall against the euro in 13 months. Back with the UK rate rise, and Amit Kara, head of UK macroeconomic forecasting at thinktank the National Institute of Economic and Social Research, said : The MPC voted 7-2 for a 25 basis points increase in Bank Rate, thereby reversing one of the three stimulus measures injected by the Bank last August in response to the EU referendum result. The economy has performed better than the Bank\u2019s post-Referendum forecast with economic growth stronger and unemployment lower. Inflation however, has exceeded the target and is now set to rise above 3 per cent in October. Although better-than-expected, economic growth overall is subdued compared with history. The MPC has also signalled a gentle rate hiking path that is similar to our forecast published yesterday. We expect the policy rate to rise by 25 basis points every six months until the Bank Rate reaches 2 per cent in 2021. US markets have made a cautious opening, as investors digest a summary of the Republican\u2019s proposed tax reforms, which include slashing corporate tax rates. More details are due shortly. There is little else on the economic agenda, although the President\u2019s choice for the next Federal Reserve chair is due to be announced later. Craig Erlam, senior market analyst at Oanda, said: The BoE\u2019s job may be done for the day but the fun may be just beginning for markets, with details of Trump\u2019s tax reforms and the new Fed Chair announcement still to come. Jerome Powell is expected to be announced as Janet Yellen\u2019s successor late on in the session which will leave another seat available on the Board of Governors for Trump to fill. Certain candidates may have missed out on the position of Chair but with other important roles to be filled, there\u2019s potential for them to join Powell at the top. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up just 0.05% while the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite have both slipped 0.2%. Here\u2019s an interesting stat from M&amp;G investment director Ritu Vohora looking at how savings and investments have performed since the last rate hike: Our calculations show that \u00a31,000 saved into a regular savings account in July 2007, the last time we had an interest rate hike, would be worth just \u00a3789 today in real terms, while the same sum invested in the FTSE All Share could have grown to \u00a31,297 after accounting for inflation. Some banks have already begun announcing their own rises following the Bank of England\u2019s base rate increase from 0.25% to 0.5%. Yorkshire Building Society says standard variable rate mortgages will rise by 0.25% to 4.99% but its Accord mortage rates fall from 5.34% to 4.99%. Savers get the full rate with 0.25% added to all variable rate accounts. Mike Regnier, chief executive at Yorkshire Building Society, said: \u201cIt has been a tough few years for savers, so we\u2019re delighted to be able to pass on the full bank rate increase.\u201d TSB says it will raise rates by the full amount on its variable rate savings, mortgage and base rate linked credit card accounts, putting customers back into the position they were at in August 2016 before the Bank cut rates by 0.25%. The changes will come into effect on 30 November 2017 for credit card customers, and the next day for mortgage and savings accounts. But Britain\u2019s largest mortgage lender Lloyds Banking Group said it would review the position but would make no immediate change except on products which track the base rate. It said: \u201cThe Bank of England base rate is only one of the many factors that influence the cost of lending.\u201d HSBC will raise tracker mortgages on Friday in line with the base rate increase, and says it will review other rates \u201cin the light of this [base rate] decision.\u201d A statement from HSBC said: \u201cAs tracker mortgages are directly linked to the base rate, these will go up in line with base rate as of tomorrow. \u201cOn average, those with an HSBC tracker mortgage with \u00a3100,000 balance would see a monthly increase of \u00a312 per month and an increase of \u00a324 for those with a \u00a3200,000 outstanding balance.\u201d On savings accounts, HSBC said: \u201cWhile our savings rates are not directly linked to the Bank of England base rate, we will be reviewing these in light of this decision and other factors, and will make our customers aware of changes in savings rates at the earliest opportunity.\u201d Barclays also said it was reviewing the situation. Meanwhile Nationwide Building Society had already said it would increase savings rates by 0.25% for all members who received a reduction of 0.25% after the rate cut in August 2016. It had said its mortgage rates would also increase in line with the base rate rise. Here\u2019s an analysis of the rate rise by our economics editor Larry Elliott: It\u2019s been a long, long time coming. The last time the Bank of England raised interest rates in July 2007, Sir Mervyn King was in charge at Threadneedle Street, Barack Obama had only recently said he would run to be US president and Gordon Brown had finally replaced Tony Blair as prime minister. Official borrowing costs are now back to where they were between early 2009 and August 2016, when there was an emergency cut in rates following the Brexit vote. The recession the Bank feared did not materialise and so \u2013 with inflation above its 2% target and the unemployment rate at its lowest in more than four decades \u2013 there has been a modest tightening of policy. The Bank was keen to point out that it was still providing help to an economy that has weakened noticeably since the turn of the year, just not quite as much stimulus as hitherto. That\u2019s clearly correct: with the cost of living rising at 3% annually and bank rate at 0.5%, real (inflation-adjusted) interest rates are still negative. Even so, the monetary policy committee\u2019s decision to raise rates now is not entirely convincing. His full piece is here: Sterling is still on the slide despite the UK rate rise, following the Bank\u2019s comments that any further increases will be gradual and limited. Against the dollar, the pound is down 0.97% at $1.3116, while against the euro it is 1.45% lower at \u20ac1.1233. The sterling index in on track for its biggest one day fall in almost five months, according to Reuters, down 1.3%. And while the fall in the pound is supporting the FTSE 100 - chock full as it is of overseas earners who benefit from weak sterling - the leading index is off its best levels. With the Bank warning about the economy amid Brexit uncertainty, the index is up 0.3% at 7510 having earlier climbed as high as 7552. Right, a recap is in order. Britain\u2019s central bank has pulled the trigger on its first interest rate rise since the financial crisis began, but also hinted that future increases will be modest. The Bank of England has raised Bank Rate from 0.25% to 0.5%, a move that was generally expected following recent hints. The rate rise is designed to pull inflation down, protecting households from the rising cost of living. It means floating-rate mortgages and saving rates should both rise. But two deputy governors refused to support the move, arguing in vain that wage growth isn\u2019t strong enough. The moves has already been criticised by the TUC, which says: \u201cToday\u2019s hike is a hammer blow for those in problem debt, whose repayments will now rise. \u201cThe Bank of England has made the wrong call \u2013 but the government must not hide behind it. Surprisingly, the pound has fallen sharply since the announcement. That\u2019s because the Bank now sounds more cautious about the path of interest rate rises. The rate rise was accompanied by a stern warning from the BoE that the Brexit vote is now having a \u2018noticeable\u2019 impact on the UK economy. It is pushing inflation up and weighing on business investment. Bank of England governor Mark Carney defended the move at a press conference in London, saying that it was time to \u2018take the foot off the accelerator\u2019. Today\u2019s hike takes borrowing costs back to their level between 2009 and 2016. Carney was pretty clear that interest rates will remain at lowish levels for a while: \u201cTo be clear, even after today\u2019s rate increase, monetary policy will provide significant support to jobs and activity. \u201cAnd the MPC continues to expect that any future increases in interest rates would be at a gradual pace and to a limited extent.\u201d Carney told reporters that UK households are well-placed to handle a rate increase, as: \u201cFully 60% of mortgages are now at fixed interest rates. Even with this Bank Rate increase, many households will re-finance onto lower interest rates than they are currently paying by around 30 basis points for those moving from an expiring two-year fixed rate deal to around two percentage points for someone refinancing an expiring five-year fixed rates deal. But Mihir Kapadia of Sun Global Investments, fears trouble ahead: It will mean an increased squeeze on consumers with loans and mortgages, thus nipping their spending and in turn affect the economy. It may well turn out to be a vicious loop, especially as Brexit woes continue to weigh down on the UK\u2019s economy Mark Carney also offered the hope that real wages, which are currently shrinking, will rise in 2018. Today\u2019s rate hike is an attempt to pin inflation down, so that people have more spending power. Carney also refused to respond to criticism from Tory MP Jacob Rees-Mogg, who claimed the governor was an enemy of Brexit. Carney insisted that the Bank\u2019s goal is simply to get inflation down towards the 2% target, while keeping unemployment low. Q: There are forecasts that the City could lost 75,000 jobs though Brexit - so could the banking sector force the Bank of England to rethink its plans if they trigger their own Brexit contingency plans? Carney sounds relaxed about this possibility. For one thing, the BoE is concerned about the whole economy, not just the City. Secondly, that 75,000 figure is plausible, but in the fullness of time -- if there isn\u2019t an agreement with the EU over financial services after Brexit. And that\u2019s the end of the press conference! Q: How bad would Brexit have to get before the Bank revises its forecasts downwards? Mark Carney says that UK businesses are, in general, expecting a transition deal to be agreed between Britain and Brussels. So what matters is what businesses expect, not whether there is a little more or less progress each month. Once we know what the deal is, or if there isn\u2019t one, the Bank will reassess the situation, he explains. Q: Ten years after the financial crisis, are we reaching a point where the downside of loose monetary policy (low interest rates and QE) are outweighing the benefits? No, Carney replies. He argues that the benefits are still worth it -- and any negative consequences (such as income and wealth inequality) can be tackled through other measures. Q: Is today\u2019s interest rise partly due to concerns over the pound? Are you trying to prop up sterling to prevent it weakening too much as other central banks change monetary policy? No, says Carney firmly. More from Carney on Brexit: Q: How can we boost the UK\u2019s productive capacity? Have you any advice for other policymakers? Carney bats this question straight over to deputy Ben Broadbent -- perhaps the governor doesn\u2019t want to stir up a row with the government! Broadbent says it\u2019s very hard to diagnose and cure the UK\u2019s problems in realtime, pointing out that economist still argue about why Britain had a decade of lost productivity in the 1860s Q: Is the MPC fundamentally split over the path of monetary policy [after today\u2019s 7-2 split], or will you move as one in future? Impossible to say, Carney replies. The Monetary Policy Committee have a range of views, and the public the media will hear from them in the coming weeks. Q: The Bank\u2019s estimate of the supply capacity in the UK economy is much lower than independent forecasters. So what do you say to people like Boris Johnson, who say you\u2019re a pessimist, or Jacob Rees-Mogg who calls you an enemy of Brexit? Let\u2019s not personalise this, Carney shoots back, saying he\u2019ll ignore the last part of the question. The message to the people of the United Kingdom is that the Bank of England is doing its job..... to bring inflation sustainably back to target while supporting jobs and activity. Q: Are you comfortable with the market forecasts for two more rate hikes during the next three years? Carney says that on a \u2018broad-brush\u2019 basis, it gets the Bank roughly where it wants to be on inflation and growth. That\u2019s a yes, then. Q: Today\u2019s inflation report doesn\u2019t suggest that the economy has improved, compared to August\u2019s report. So why raise rates right now, rather than waiting to see how the economy performs in the next few months? Carney says that \u2018unit labour costs\u2019 have risen (even if wages haven\u2019t), showing that firms are facing higher costs for employing people. On a broader level, there is a limit to how long the Bank of England can tolerate inflation being over its target. We have stretched our targets, and waited a long time, before deciding to tighten policy a little today. Carney adds that the Bank wants people to trust them to keep inflation under control, and maintain the stability of the financial system, as the UK goes into Brexit. Q: How high will interest rates rise before the Bank of England starts to unwind its bond-buying stimulus scheme? Carney declines to give a target, but says the BoE\u2019s plan is to use interest rate changes as their primary tool before turning to QE. Deputy governor Ben Broadbent suggests that we\u2019re all getting too excited about today\u2019s rate rise. Before the crisis, interest rates would move every four months he says. Q: The last time the Bank of England raised rates (in 2007), it was forced to cut a few months later. So if the same thing happens again, will it be a nimble response or can we say you\u2019ve made a mistake? Carney leans towards the \u2018nimble response\u2019 option (of course!). He then explains that Britain faces uncertain time, due to the EU referendum vote. The Bank is already balancing the trade-off between inflation and job losses. Future policy changes (interest rate rises, or falls) will primarily be determined by how the Brexit negotiations play out. Q: Many people will be surprised to hear you say that real wages will start rising soon. Why do you think that? The UK inflation rate (currently 3%) should start falling in 2018, Carney replies. That means the cost of living will take a smaller bite out of wages. And on the earnings side, the Bank believes that pay rises (currently 2.1%) will pick up in 2018, as productivity picks up. So there should be a \u2018gradual\u2019 pick up in real wages. But don\u2019t get excited -- wage growth is still expected to be below historical averages in a couple of years time. Q: Today\u2019s rate rise follows several interest rate rises in America, with more expected. In Europe, the ECB will slow its stimulus programme in January.... So...are global central banks now moving together to withdraw the stimulus pumped into the world economy since the crisis? Mark Carney says the global economy is doing very well -- if it were a 12-cylinder engine it would be firing on 11 of them. So yes, the stance of monetary policy is changing in the face of a synchronised pick-up in global growth. But Britain is lagging behind in this growth revival, he adds. Carney says that the Brexit vote has exacerbated Britain\u2019s long-standing productivity problems, by deterring businesses from making new investments. This is affecting the amount of spare capacity in the UK economy (a key factor on how fast the Bank will raise interest rates). Carney drops a hint that the Bank will rethink its forecasts if Britain agrees a deal with Brussels: Q: Should banks pass this rate rise onto savers? We do expect it to be passed on, Carney replies, pointing out that banks passed on last August\u2019s rate cut. Here\u2019s a video clip of Mark Carney speaking at today\u2019s press conference: Q: Is today\u2019s hike the start of a rate rise cycle? Mark Carney says the Bank\u2019s forecasts are based on two more rate rises over the forecast horizon (the next three years). We need those rate rises to get inflation back to target, and prevent the economy running \u2018too hot\u2019, he adds. Deputy governor Sir Dave Ramsden is alongside Mark Carney - but he refuses to say why he voted AGAINST today\u2019s interest rate hike. Governor Carney is now taking questions. Q: Why have you raised interest rates today, and pushed up the cost of living for millions of people? Carney repeats his line about taking the Bank\u2019s foot off the accelerator. He argues that UK growth isn\u2019t subdued (although slower than historic norms) pointing out that employment is at record highs. Carney also argues that raising rates will bring inflation down, and help protect consumers from falling real wages. Onto Brexit, and Carney says Britain\u2019s exit from the EU is the biggest factor determining the country\u2019s long-term economic prospects. He says the Brexit vote has already pushed up prices and weighed on growth. Mark Carney insists that UK households are \u201cwell positioned\u201d for today\u2019s interest rate rise. Most mortgages are on fixed-rates, he continues. And many people who refinance their mortgages soon will probably move to cheaper rates than before. Even after today\u2019s rise, monetary policy is still very loose, Carney continues, and will continue to support the economy and keep unemployment low. Mark Carney begins his press conference by confirming that Bank Rate has been raised by 0.25% to 0.5%. He says that with prices rising, and spare capacity falling, inflation is \u201cunlikely to return to the 2% target\u201d without an increase in interest rates. But these are not normal times, he continues. Brexit will redefine the UK\u2019s relationship with Europe, and will have consequences on the movement of goods, services, people and capital, as well as the real incomes of households, he continues. So, with domestic inflationary pressures building, Carney says: The time has come to ease our foot off the accelerator. Over at the Bank of England, Mark Carney is facing Britain\u2019s economics journalists to explain today\u2019s interest rate rise. You can watch it live here. Future interest rate rises will depend heavily on Britain\u2019s exit from the EU, says Trevor Greetham, Head of Multi Asset at Royal London Asset Management: We expect the Bank of England to wait and see before making further changes. As the Bank made clear in their statement, Brexit is still the elephant in the room and there are considerable risks to the economic outlook and to sterling, which sold off in the aftermath of the announcement. \u201cNearly eighteen months on from the referendum, all options remain plausible. It\u2019s hard to imagine a continued tightening of monetary policy in a disruptive no deal outcome, and in this scenario sterling could easily fall another 10 to 15%. On the other hand, if permanent single market membership becomes likely, or if we see a reversal of the decision to leave the EU, the Bank of England would be comfortable raising rates further. In this case, sterling would probably rise 10 to 15%. Don\u2019t expect much improvement in \u201ccrap\u201d savings rates after today\u2019s rate hike, says moneysavingexpert.com\u2019s Martin Lewis. \u201cLow interest rates have been a plague for many with savings, especially those who retired and expected to live off the interest. So rate rises are generally good news for them \u2013 indeed we\u2019ve already seen rates crawl up in expectation. The top easy access deal is now 1.3%, compared to just 1% a few months ago. This means I doubt we\u2019ll see the top best-buys rise by the full 0.25% over the next few weeks. With a little bit of crystal ball gazing I\u2019d say we\u2019ll see them max out at 1.4% to 1.5%. \u201cYet many people have money in savings accounts already paying pitiful, spitworth rates like 0.1%, and they are unlikely to rise. Those in a middling account paying about 0.5% may see an increase over the next few weeks. But if you\u2019re earning less than 1%, it\u2019s a crap account anyway so you should ditch and switch.\u201d Millions of Britain\u2019s homeowners and credit card holders have never experienced an interest rate rise before. So today\u2019s rise could be a nasty shock. Yael Selfin, chief economist at KPMG UK, explains: Long suffering savers will rejoice in today\u2019s news of a first rise in UK interest rates in over a decade, but banks and insurers should also beware of the potential impact on their liabilities as their customers feel the strain. Consumers are already under pressure from falling real wages and the rise in consumer debt. So even a mild and gradual course of rate rises is likely to make a bigger impact this time. \u201cA decade of no rate rises has made many households complacent about the prospects of higher interest rates when considering their finance Today\u2019s interest rate hike might be the last one for a while, says Jeremy Cook, chief Economist at WorldFirst. \u201cThe all-important guidance for the future is that this may be the only rate rise for a while. For the Bank to drop the line that \u2018rates may need to rise more than the market expects\u2019 is not a supportive move for future rate rise expectations. TUC General Secretary Frances O\u2019Grady says the Bank of England has blundered by raising interest rates today. \u201cThis is the last thing hard-pressed families need. With living standards falling, the economy needs boosting not reining in. \u201cToday\u2019s hike is a hammer blow for those in problem debt, whose repayments will now rise. \u201cThe Bank of England has made the wrong call \u2013 but the government must not hide behind it. \u201cWorking people are paying the price for ministers\u2019 failure to get wages rising. And for their failure to invest in jobs and services when interest rates were so low.\u201d Another important point -- the Bank of England has dropped its warning that interest rates might rise faster than the City expected over the next few years. That reference was included in the minutes of September\u2019s meeting, when the Bank said: If the economy were to follow a path broadly consistent with the August Inflation Report central projection, then monetary policy could need to be tightened by a somewhat greater extent over the forecast than the path implied by the yield curve underlying the August Report. This hint that City traders were behind the curve has been dropped from today\u2019s minutes. That helps explain why the pound has fallen so sharply since noon. The Bank of England has also warned that Britain\u2019s decision to leave the European Union is having a \u201cnoticeable impact on the economic outlook\u201d. It says: The overshoot of inflation throughout the forecast predominantly reflects the effects on import prices of the referendum-related fall in sterling. Uncertainties associated with Brexit are weighing on domestic activity, which has slowed even as global growth has risen significantly. And Brexit-related constraints on investment and labour supply appear to be reinforcing the marked slowdown that has been increasingly evident in recent years in the rate at which the economy can grow without generating inflationary pressures. But despite these concerns, it has taken the plunge and raise Bank Rate to 0.5%. Right, this is important. The Bank of England says it only expects interest rates to rise gradually over the next three years. The minutes of today\u2019s meetings make it clear that the MPC is moving cautiously, with its first interest rate rise since Gordon Brown was prime minister. The Bank says: \u201cThe MPC now judges it appropriate to tighten modestly the stance of monetary policy in order to return inflation sustainably to target. All members agree that any future increases in Bank Rate will be at a gradual pace and to a limited extent,\u201d That has had an immediate impact on sterling -- the pound has now fallen by one cent against the US dollar, to $1.314. It\u2019s official: Today\u2019s decision wasn\u2019t unanimous. Two deputy governors, Sir Jon Cunliffe and Sir Dave Ramsden. both voted to leave borrowing costs unchanged. But they were outvoted by the rest of the MPC. BREAKING: The Bank of England has voted to raise UK interest rates, for the first time in over a decade. Interest rates are going up to 0.5%, from 0.25%. That means the Bank has reversed the rate cut of August 2016, when it eased monetary policy to help Britain\u2019s economy through the aftermath of the Brexit vote. More to follow! Stand by your desks, folks, the Bank of England decision is just 60 seconds away.... The Bank of England tweets.....a link to Mark Carney\u2019s press conference at 12.30pm :) Tension is mounting in the City (and the newsroom!) as the clock ticks towards noon. Will they? Won\u2019t they? Paul Mumford of Cavendish Asset Management says the Bank of England faced a tricky decision this month: \u201cWe\u2019ve known for some time that the zero rate era can\u2019t go on forever. But with continued high levels of debt in the economy and business lending remaining anaemic compared to historic levels, there is a real question mark over how appropriate a rise would be \u2013 and that\u2019s not to mention the uncertainties around Brexit. Rises can harm the economy by killing off consumer spending, so it looks as if the Bank of England has found itself between a rock and a hard place on this one. Guardian Business has launched a daily email. Besides the key news headlines that you\u2019d expect, there\u2019s an at-a-glance agenda of the day\u2019s main events, insightful opinion pieces and a quality feature to sink your teeth into each day. For your morning shot of financial news, sign up here: Less than 20 minutes to go! And sterling is falling as the City prepares for the Bank of England\u2019s rate decision. The pound has lost half a cent against the US dollar to $1.319, as jitteriness builds. Economist Danny Blanchflower was on the MPC the last time it raised interest rates, in July 2007. Blanchflower voted against (it was a 6-3 split),and he\u2019s also vote against a rate rise today if he got the chance. Speaking on Bloomberg TV, Blanchflower says the 2007 hike was a mistake, as the UK went into recession in 2008. He argues that the economic data doesn\u2019t justify a hike today, as Britain\u2019s growth is \u201chorrible\u201d compared to other countries, real wages are falling, and inflation should drop next year as the one-off impact of the weak pound fades away. Here\u2019s a list of the eight men and one (!) woman who set UK monetary policy, and decide whether interest rates go up today. Two of them, Michael Saunders and Ian McCafferty, voted for an interest rise in September but were outvoted. Of the rest, Sir Jon Cunliffe and Sir Dave Ramsden have both sounded quite cautious in recent days. Governor Mark Carney has been more hawkish, suggesting \u201csome withdrawal of monetary stimulus\u201d will be appropriate soon. His other deputy, Ben Broadbent, has been flying under the radar and not giving any hints (Pythagoras would approve, eh?) External member Gertjan Vlieghe suggested recently that he could be minded to raise rates soon, while Silvana Tenreyro has said her decision will be determined by the economic data. Andy Haldane, the Bank\u2019s chief economist, is the wild card in the pack. He had been one of the most dovish members of the MPC, but in September he argued that a rate rise would be \u2018good news\u2019, and a sign that the economy was healthy. Betting firm smarkets tells me there\u2019s an implied probability of 87% that UK interest rates will rise from 0.25% to 0.50% today. So, the markets could be rather lively if the Bank of England surprises us at noon... In classical economics, a central bank would raise interest rates when it worried that the economy was rattling along too quickly, pushing inflation too high. But that\u2019s not the case this time. So some economist are worried that the Bank of England might hike interest rates because it is pessimistic, not optimistic, about the UK\u2019s prospects. In this scenario, the Bank concludes that Britain has suffered a permanent shock from the 2008 financial crisis; productivity will not recover, so there\u2019s less spare capacity in the economy. Thus, it would be risky to leave borrowing costs so low. Duncan Weldon, head of research at the Resolution Group has written about this for Prospect. Here\u2019s a flavour: In the MPC\u2019s view, spare economic capacity has been eroded and inflationary pressures will start to build at a lower rate of growth than in the past. In effect it used to think the UK economy was capable of motoring along at 70 miles per hour before the vehicle began to shake and the ride became uncomfortable. They now think that persistent engine troubles have lowered that speed limit to around 50 miles per hour and so, despite the fact that we used to drive much faster, they are moving to put their foot on the brake already. After a decade of record low interest rates, British savers should welcome a hike today. But they shouldn\u2019t celebrate too loudly -- a quarter-point rise in borrowing costs won\u2019t make them much richer. Richard Theo, CEO of online investment firm Wealthify, explains: Today\u2019s long-awaited rate rise may seem like welcome news for UK savers, but it will be a double-edged sword for many Brits, giving slightly better cash savings returns with one hand, then taking them away in the form of higher debt repayments, with the other. Savers should check their sums before celebrating. Assuming all the benefits of the rate rise are passed on to the consumer, which is by no means a given, a 0.25% increase will give a saver with a \u00a320k pot just \u00a350 extra per year in returns. With 90 minutes to go, here are some reminders of how the world was different back in July 2007, the last time UK interest rates rose. Any homeowner on a variable-rate mortgage will take an immediate hit in the pocket if the Bank of England raises interest rates today. But that\u2019s only around one in ten households in the UK, compared to around 20% a decade ago. That\u2019s partly because more people have fixed mortgages today. It also reflects the generational divide - older people have paid off their mortgages and own outright, while many young adults haven\u2019t been able to get onto the housing ladder at all. Torsten Bell, director of the Resolution Foundation, has written a blogpost about this, explaining how the short-term impact of a rate rise is limited. Here\u2019s a flavour (more here): The combination of these three trends \u2013 falling home ownership, growing outright ownership, and the shift towards fixed rate mortgages \u2013 means that only around 11 per cent of families have variable rate mortgages in Britain today. And they have smaller mortgage balances than those that have fixed \u2013 an average of \u00a370,000 compared to \u00a396,000. To estimate the overnight mortgage impact of a rate rise, we can look at what happens if we add 0.25 percentage points to the interest rates paid by the 11 per cent of families with non-fixed rate mortgages. The result is an average increase in repayments of families of \u00a36.40 a month (or 1.3 per cent of their existing repayments). Spreading the cost across all mortgage holders, the average repayment increase is just \u00a32.50 a month. Eventually, a rate rise will feed through to more borrowers as fixed-rate mortgage deals are renewed. But still, raising interest rates from 0.25% to 0.5% certainly isn\u2019t a repeat of Black Wednesday in 1992, when rates were hiked from 10% to 15% (and back again, after Britain crashed out of the exchange-rate mechanism). Newsflash: Britain\u2019s building sector returned to growth last month. That\u2019s according to data firm Markit, whose Construction PMI has risen to 50.8, up from 48.1 in September. Any reading over 50 shows a rise in activity, so this is good news. But there\u2019s bad news too.... confidence among British construction firms has hit its lowest level since December 2012. A group of demonstrators have gathered outside the Bank of England. They\u2019re from Positive Money, a group pushing for \u2018QE for People\u2019 -- the idea that Britain creates new money to spend on green infrastructure, education or other social benefits. Fran Boait, Executive Director of Positive Money, warns that an interest rate hike today could be very damaging: \u201cA decision today to raise rates at a time when real wages are falling risks shortening the fuse on Britain\u2019s ticking household debt time bomb. The Bank of England needs new policy tools which can deliver a sustainable boost to incomes, such as QE for People.\u201d Currently, the Bank\u2019s QE (quantitative easing) programme has only bought government and corporate bonds, which has driven up their price and also fuelled the stock market rally. Central banks claim that their QE programmes have propped up the economy and kept unemployment low, but critics argue that they also increased wealth inequality...and even created the economic conditions that led to the Brexit vote and Donald Trump\u2019s presidency. Communication is one of the most important implements in a central banker\u2019s toolbox, as he or she can move the markets with words as well as actions. But Professor Costas Milas and Dr Mike Ellington of Liverpool University reckons the Bank of England should have listened to Pythagoras, and not dropped so many hints about raising interest rates. They write: Greek philosopher and mathematician Pythagoras of Samos famously said that \u201cSilence is better than unmeaning words\u201d. This is something that the Bank of England\u2019s Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) members have arguably neglected: they have repeatedly signalled a rise in their rock-bottom policy rate only to fail to delivery such a rise.... Prof Milas also agues that the Bank should NOT raise interest rates today, because it will create pressure to keep hiking until inflation has come down. Fresh academic research has found that in the presence of rising economic uncertainty, monetary policy tightening becomes less effective. The reason is that elevated uncertainty motivates agents to postpone decisions until more precise information becomes available, and this cautiousness makes them less responsive to changes in the economic environment, including the interest rate. The implication for the UK, where Brexit related economic uncertainty is indeed on the rise, is that an interest rate hike of 25 basis points on Thursday will have a much smaller impact on inflation and GDP growth than conventional wisdom suggests. This poses a challenging dilemma for MPC members. Do they hike in order to remain credible, or do they continue to \u2018wait and see\u2019? If the MPC vote to hike, subsequent hikes will be necessary in order to meet the inflation target over the medium term. This comes at the expense of depressing GDP growth further. Our view is to abstain until the uncertainty cloud of Brexit negotiations starts to clear. The MPC members should take Pythagoras\u2019 advice and only signal with intent. Bloomberg\u2019s Peter Hoskins points out that UK borrowing costs have been at historically low levels for the last decade - even lower than in the Great Depression and the second world war. City investors and traders will be desperate for clues from the Bank of England about how interest rate could move over the coming years. That\u2019s because the long-term path of rates is more important than a mere 0.25% move. So, the Bank could cushion a rate hike by sounding dovish about its future intentions. David McNamara of stockbrokers Davy explains: With a rate hike all but a done deal today, attention will focus on the guidance for the coming year, with markets pricing in one further hike by the end of 2018. Nonetheless, with the economy slowing and Brexit looming, today\u2019s hike might yet prove a \u201cone and done\u201d event. Today is a historic day for the Bank of England whether it raises interest rates or not, says Lee Wild, Head of Equity Strategy at Interactive Investor. A hike will be the first in a decade; another month of stalemate will damage the credibility of both the central bank and Mark Carney as governor. An overshoot on inflation is almost entirely down to the weak pound, but unemployment at a 42-year low and a slew of improving data reflect an economy more than capable of coping in a higher interest rate world. But Wild also warns that the Bank must avoid damaging consumer confidence, which already looks fragile: The timing isn\u2019t great for families struggling with the lag in wages growth to inflation, and who are now beginning to plan their Christmas budgets. Brexit is already causing many to rethink their spending, so rate-setters must tread carefully to avoid a policy mistake further down the line. The financial markets reckon there\u2019s a 90% chance that UK interest rates are raised at noon today. That\u2019s thanks to the various hints dropped by members of the Monetary Policy Committee recently, as Labour MP Alison McGovern tweets: It also means there will be wild scenes in the City if the Bank surprises us all with another \u2018no change\u2019 decision. The pound is bobbing nervously around the $1.326 mark this morning, as City traders brace for today\u2019s interest rate decision. Sterling is likely to move sharply at noon. It\u2019ll surely fall if Carney and colleagues leave rates unchanged, but could rally if the Bank hikes and hints at further rate rises down the line. Incidentally, the pound is still worth around 10% less than before the EU referendum, when it was worth $1.48. Good morning. A lot has changed since 5th July 2007. Back then, Gordon Brown had just become prime minister, the financial crisis hadn\u2019t yet struck, and the Bank of England was sufficiently worried about inflation to raise interest rates, to 5.75% - a six-year high. No-one knew then that the Bank wouldn\u2019t be raising interest rates again for a decade. So there\u2019s genuine excitement in the City of London this morning, as the BoE prepares to reveal whether it has taken the plunge and hiked borrowing costs at this month\u2019s meeting. Bloomberg surveyed 60 economists, and found that 52 expect the Bank to raise rates by a quarter of one percent, to 0.5%. That\u2019s because the BoE has dropped a series of hints in recent weeks that a rise is likely \u201cin the coming months\u201d. Today\u2019s meeting would be a obvious opportunity. A rise today would reverse the stimulus that was pumped into the economy in August 2016, to help it cope with the Brexit shock. And with inflation over target, at 3%, there is an argument that borrowing costs should be tightened. But...some City experts fear that the Bank could make a serious mistake if it raises borrowing costs too soon. The UK economy looks quite fragile, with growth lagging behind the eurozone this year. Consumer spending is slowing, and business confidence is being hurt by the uncertainty over Britain\u2019s exit from the EU. A premature rate hike risks damaging the economy, as well as driving up mortgage costs and hurting those relying on credit to make ends meet. So the nine members of the Monetary Policy Committee may have felt a little nervous as they weighed up the evidence this month. Each member gets a vote - so it could be a close split, or a decisive 9-0 walkover. It\u2019s also a massive test for governor Mark Carney, who hinted in September that a rate rise was close. He could firmly cement his reputation as an \u2018unreliable boyfriend\u2019 if the Bank doesn\u2019t actually deliver today. Carney will face the press shortly after the decision is announced at noon, so we\u2019ll hear what he has to say about the state of the UK economy, and Brexit of course. The agenda 9am: Eurozone manufacturing PMI for October. This will show how Europe\u2019s factories fared last month. 9.30am: UK construction PMI for October is released. Economists fear that it will show the sector shrank for the second month running Noon: Bank of England\u2019s interest rate decision!! Noon: Bank of England\u2019s new quarterly inflation report released. This will include new growth and inflation forecasts 12.30pm: Mark Carney holds a press conference to explain today\u2019s decision.",

Even if you guess the right outcome, predicting the effect on asset prices is a different ball game.</p> <p>In theory an interest rate rise should be positive for the pound and the banking sector, and negative for gilts and the FTSE 100. Today the pound fell, as did Lloyds and RBS shares, while gilts and the broader Footsie rallied, turning the investment textbook on its head.</p> <p>This is largely because markets wanted more than a rate rise from the Bank of England today, and were pricing in a more hawkish stance on the future path of monetary policy. As things now stand, it looks like we\u2019re only going to get two rate rises in the next three years.</p> <p>Markets therefore have had to retrace their steps and pare back some of the price movements we have seen in misplaced anticipation of a more hawkish Bank of England.</p> <p>Looking forward rates can be expected to rise slowly and gradually, unless there is a very negative, or indeed a very positive, Brexit surprise. That will be supportive of equity markets and continue to offer little protection to cash savers from the ravages of inflation.

The BoE looks set to tighten policy slowly, but the first UK rate hike in over decade highlights how shrinking output gaps and tighter labour markets are pushing central banks towards interest rate normalisation...</p> <p>Fitch has for some time been expecting the post-referendum interest rate cut to be reversed, although in our most recent Global Economic Outlook (September 2017), we expected this to happen in early 2018. The MPC summary said that all members agreed that future increases \u201cwould be expected to be at a gradual pace and to a limited extent,\u201d and that monetary policy \u201ccontinues to provide significant support to jobs and activity.\u201d</p> <p>We think another increase is unlikely in the next 12 months, given the impact of Brexit uncertainty on the outlook for investment. Today\u2019s decision does not alter our UK growth forecasts , which see a net trade boost partially offsetting slower domestic demand this year, enabling real GDP to rise by 1.5%, before slowing to 1.3% next year. But it remains to be seen how firms and households adjust to a shift in the monetary policy stance after such a long period without a rate rise.</p> </blockquote> <p><a href=\"https://www.fitchratings.com/site/pr/10010001\">The full Fitch statement is here.</a></p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2017-11-02T17:16:05.463Z\">at 5.16pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-59fb4ff969a70e05d9e48e04\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-11-02T17:05:29.826Z\">5.05pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Sign up for our daily email</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Every weekday morning, Business Today will deliver the biggest stories, smartest analysis and hottest topics, direct to your inbox.</strong></p> <p>Besides the key news headlines that you\u2019d expect, there\u2019ll be an at-a-glance agenda of the day\u2019s main events, insightful opinion pieces and a quality feature to sink your teeth into each day. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/info/2017/may/16/guardian-business-today-sign-up-financial-news-email\">You can sign up here.</a></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/info/2017/may/16/guardian-business-today-sign-up-financial-news-email\">Business Today: sign up for a morning shot of financial news</a> </p> </aside> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-59fb49d069a70e05d9e48dad\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-11-02T16:39:04.749Z\">4.39pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">FTSE closes just shy of new peak</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The FTSE 100 has closed, and it didn\u2019t quite make a new record.</p> <p>The index is up 0.9% at 7555.32, less than a point below its all time closing high set on 12 October.</p> <p>The fall in sterling of course has provided the support for the index, with the pound down 1.4% against the dollar and 1.7% against the euro.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-59fb473c57bca206682cca34\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-11-02T16:28:20.767Z\">4.28pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The pound has been falling on the basis that the Bank of England\u2019s rate rise is a dovish one, and further increases are not likely in the near term.</p> <p>But Capital Economics believes the markets may be underestimating the situation:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We continue to think that the markets are underestimating how quickly rates will rise in the UK, though, as the economy weathers the uncertainty over Brexit well.

The reason is that elevated uncertainty motivates agents to postpone decisions until more precise information becomes available, and this cautiousness makes them less responsive to changes in the economic environment, including the interest rate. The implication for the UK, where Brexit related economic uncertainty is indeed on the rise, is that an interest rate hike of 25 basis points on Thursday will have a much <em>smaller</em> impact on inflation and GDP growth than conventional wisdom suggests.</p> <p>This poses a challenging dilemma for MPC members. Do they hike in order to remain credible, or do they continue to \u2018wait and see\u2019? If the MPC vote to hike, subsequent hikes will be necessary in order to meet the inflation target over the medium term. This comes at the expense of depressing GDP growth further. Our view is to abstain until the uncertainty cloud of Brexit negotiations starts to clear. The MPC members should take Pythagoras\u2019 advice and only signal with intent.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2017-11-02T09:37:45.227Z\">at 9.37am GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-59fadf87a2f1ae05ff6eb6d5\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-11-02T09:05:51.866Z\">9.05am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Bloomberg\u2019s Peter Hoskins points out that UK borrowing costs have been at historically low levels for the last decade - even lower than in the Great Depression and the second world war.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/PeterHoskinsTV/status/925997242892333056\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">As <a href=\"https://twitter.com/bankofengland?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@bankofengland</a> is expected to raise rates for the first time in more than a decade, this chart shows just what unusual times we live in. <a href=\"https://t.co/7XQEuZO3Uw\">pic.twitter.com/7XQEuZO3Uw</a></p>&mdash; Peter Hoskins (@PeterHoskinsTV) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/PeterHoskinsTV/status/925997242892333056?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">November 2, 2017</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-59faddcaa2f1ae05ff6eb6c7\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-11-02T09:04:05.197Z\">9.04am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>City investors and traders will be desperate for clues from the Bank of England about how interest rate could move over the coming years.</strong></p> <p>That\u2019s because the long-term path of rates is more important than a mere 0.25% move.</p> <p>So, the Bank could cushion a rate hike by sounding dovish about its future intentions.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:david.mcnamara@davy.ie\">David McNamara</a> of stockbrokers Davy explains:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>With a rate hike all but a done deal today, attention will focus on the guidance for the coming year, with markets pricing in one further hike by the end of 2018.</p> <p>Nonetheless, with the economy slowing and Brexit looming, today\u2019s hike might yet prove a \u201cone and done\u201d event.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-59fad7a0a2f1ae05ff6eb697\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-11-02T08:48:18.899Z\">8.48am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Today is a historic day for the Bank of England whether it raises interest rates or not, says Lee Wild, Head of Equity Strategy at Interactive Investor.</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>A hike will be the first in a decade; another month of stalemate will damage the credibility of both the central bank and Mark Carney as governor.</p> <p>An overshoot on inflation is almost entirely down to the weak pound, but unemployment at a 42-year low and a slew of improving data reflect an economy more than capable of coping in a higher interest rate world.</p> </blockquote> <p>But Wild also warns that the Bank must avoid damaging consumer confidence, which already looks fragile:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The timing isn\u2019t great for families struggling with the lag in wages growth to inflation, and who are now beginning to plan their Christmas budgets.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "London house price growth is forecast to lag well behind other regions over the next five years, reversing a trend stretching back decades, according to a new report. Savills, the upmarket estate agent, is predicting that average house prices in the capital will fall 1.5% this year and 2% in 2018, and be flat in 2019, before returning to growth. Overall, property values in London will rise 7.1% between 2018 and 2022, far below every other region and sharply down from the 56% growth seen in the capital over the last five years. Across the UK as a whole, Savills expects house price growth to halve to 14% over the next five years, from the 28% growth recorded since 2012. This reverses the trend stretching back at least to the 1980s for house prices in London to grow at a faster rate than the rest of the UK. The average house price in the capital was \u00a3484,000 in August 2017, according to the latest Office for National Statistics figures, compared with a UK average of \u00a3226,000. Savills\u2019 forecast for the next five years says house prices in London would rise well below inflation, which is forecast to rise by 9.5% over the period, leading to a fall in real property values. Nationally, Savills said the housing market had proved stronger than expected this year, with average prices likely to rise 2% rather than stagnating, as the estate agent forecast a year ago. Lucian Cook, Savills head of residential research, said: \u201cUncertainty over what Brexit means for the UK economy and how it will impact household finances will increasingly act as a drag on house prices. \u201cThere is capacity for growth once we have greater clarity, but this will be constrained by rate rises and the corresponding ability to get mortgage debt, particularly in London and other higher-value locations.\u201d He added that the Bank of England\u2019s interest rate rise on Thursday was more \u201csymbolic than substantive\u201d and that the pace at which it ratchets up borrowing costs in coming years would be more important. The Bank said rates would rise \u201cat a gradual pace and to a limited extent\u201d. Savills assumes the Bank\u2019s base rate will rise to 2.25% by 2022, which would lead to average mortgage rates doubling to 4%. The north-west of England is set to experience the fastest price growth in the UK over the next five years: a surge of 18.1%, followed by increases of 17.6% in the north-east and Yorkshire and Humberside region, with 17% growth in Scotland. Savills forecast that rents are set to grow faster than house prices in London for the first time since 2011. They are forecast to rise 17% over the next five years, despite a 3% fall this year. Low mortgage rates, solid job growth and the lack of homes on the market have to some extent countered the squeeze on household incomes from rising inflation and stagnating wages, the Nationwide building society reported this week. However, as uncertainty caused by the Brexit vote continues to deter many buyers, Savills expects price growth to slow to 1% next year before picking up again. In London, the average house costs nearly 13 times the average person\u2019s annual earnings. Beyond the home counties, affordability is far less stretched, with house prices rising more in line with incomes. In the north-west, the average house price is 5.6 times average earnings. The average deposit paid by first-time buyers in the north-west is \u00a319,000, just over half their annual income; while in London it is \u00a399,753, or 149% of average income.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "It\u2019s been a long, long time coming. The last time the Bank of England raised interest rates in July 2007, Sir Mervyn King was in charge at Threadneedle Street, Barack Obama had only recently said he would run to be US president and Gordon Brown had finally replaced Tony Blair as prime minister. Official borrowing costs are now back to where they were between early 2009 and August 2016, when there was an emergency cut in rates following the Brexit vote. The recession the Bank feared did not materialise and so \u2013 with inflation above its 2% target and the unemployment rate at its lowest in more than four decades \u2013 there has been a modest tightening of policy. The Bank was keen to point out that it was still providing help to an economy that has weakened noticeably since the turn of the year, just not quite as much stimulus as hitherto. That\u2019s clearly correct: with the cost of living rising at 3% annually and bank rate at 0.5%, real (inflation-adjusted) interest rates are still negative. Even so, the monetary policy committee\u2019s decision to raise rates now is not entirely convincing. Sure, inflation stands at 3%, but that is due to two one-off factors \u2013 the fall in sterling following the EU referendum and rising oil prices. In the past, the Bank has \u201clooked through\u201d temporary increases in inflation and could have done so again. Nor has there been any real evidence thus far of falling unemployment leading to higher wage growth. The Bank believes that pay will soon rise because there are few spare workers around, but it has been whistling this tune ever since Mark Carney became governor four-and-a-half years ago. Indeed, the two dissenting voices on the MPC \u2013 Jon Cunliffe and Dave Ramsden \u2013 said unemployment could carry on falling from its current rate of 4.3% without wage growth responding. The Bank\u2019s decision was based on four key judgments: that continued strong growth in the global economy helps the UK; that the economy rebalances towards investment and exports; that diminished slack in the labour market and poor productivity performance mean that even a modest increase in demand will lead to rising inflation; and that domestic inflationary pressures will start to build even as the impact of higher import prices fades. There was, though, an added consideration \u2013 namely that a no-change decision would have been seen by the financial markets as the Bank bottling it. For the past couple of months, it has primed the City for a rate rise and there would have been repercussions had the bank rate been left at 0.25%. In particular, there would have been a danger of a fresh fall in the pound, which would have given another upward twist to import prices, leading to an even-more pronounced squeeze on living standards. As the Bank knows full well, this was not an ideal time to be raising rates, even though it believes they would need to go to 2% before households with mortgages would really start to feel the pain. The minutes of the MPC meeting note that Brexit uncertainty is weighing on the economy and recent reports from the high street suggest a grim Christmas is in store for retailers. So, having boxed itself into a corner, the Bank has sought to reassure the public that it is expecting only two more quarter-point increases in the next two years and will assess the impact of the first rate rise in more than a decade before moving again. This \u2013 although it sounds like a contradiction in terms \u2013 was a dovish rate rise.",

The last time the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/bankofenglandgovernor\">Bank of England </a>raised interest rates in July 2007, Sir Mervyn King was in charge at Threadneedle Street, Barack Obama had only recently said he would run to be US president and Gordon Brown had finally replaced Tony Blair as prime minister.<br></p> \n<p>Official borrowing costs are now back to where they were between early 2009 and August 2016, when there was an emergency cut in rates following the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/eu-referendum\">Brexit </a>vote. The recession the Bank feared did not materialise and so \u2013 with inflation above its 2% target and the unemployment rate at its lowest in more than four decades \u2013 there has been a modest tightening of policy.</p> \n<p>The Bank was keen to point out that it was still providing help to an economy that has weakened noticeably since the turn of the year, just not quite as much stimulus as hitherto. That\u2019s clearly correct: with the cost of living rising at 3% annually and bank rate at 0.5%, real (inflation-adjusted) interest rates are still negative.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"5cabd7be-b5eb-47dd-abff-1cb3bed9e36e\" data-atom-type=\"qanda\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Qanda\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Lenders have already bumped up the cost of fixed rate mortgages ahead of the Bank of England\u2019s decision to raise base rate from 0.25% to 0.5%, and mortgage borrowers on tracker and variable rates will see their monthly payments become more expensive in the coming days.&nbsp;\u200b</p>\n    <p>Savers will gain as banks and building societies improve the rates available on deposit and Isa accounts, although increases are unlikely to come for several weeks.</p>\n    <p>How much consumers and businesses cut back on spending and investment in the face of higher rates will depend on signals from the Bank about the trend for future increases.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Even so, the monetary policy committee\u2019s decision to raise rates now is not entirely convincing. Sure, inflation stands at 3%, but that is due to two one-off factors \u2013 the fall in sterling following the EU referendum and rising oil prices. In the past, the Bank has \u201clooked through\u201d temporary increases in inflation and could have done so again.</p> \n<p>Nor has there been any real evidence thus far of falling unemployment leading to higher wage growth. The Bank believes that pay will soon rise because there are few spare workers around, but it has been whistling this tune ever since Mark Carney became governor four-and-a-half years ago.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/nov/02/bank-of-england-raises-uk-interest-rates-brexit-inflation\">Bank of England raises UK interest rates for first time in more than a decade</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Indeed, the two dissenting voices on the MPC \u2013 Jon Cunliffe and Dave Ramsden \u2013 said unemployment could carry on falling from its current rate of 4.3% without wage growth responding.</p> \n<p>The Bank\u2019s decision was based on four key judgments: that continued strong growth in the global economy helps the UK; that the economy rebalances towards investment and exports; that diminished slack in the labour market and poor productivity performance mean that even a modest increase in demand will lead to rising inflation; and that domestic inflationary pressures will start to build even as the impact of higher import prices fades.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/info/2017/may/16/guardian-business-today-sign-up-financial-news-email\">Business Today: sign up for a morning shot of financial news</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>There was, though, an added consideration \u2013 namely that a no-change decision would have been seen by the financial markets as the Bank bottling it.

      "bodyText": "The 0.25% rise in Bank of England base rate to 0.5% may be small, but it marks the first rise in borrowing costs for a decade. Many mortgages will rise in cost, but savers will be looking forwards to better returns. How much will my mortgage go up? By about \u00a322 a month, if you are the average homebuyer with the typical mortgage in Britain of \u00a3175,000. The 500,000 borrowers on one of the most popular deals, Nationwide\u2019s base mortgage rate tracker, will see their interest rise from 2.25% to 2.5%, taking the monthly bill from \u00a3763 to \u00a3785 on a \u00a3175,000 loan. I have fixed my mortgage so I presume this means nothing to me? Yes and no. Currently 57% of homeowners are on fixed-rate deals, so their monthly payments will remain the same, irrespective of today\u2019s rise. But many are on relatively short two-year fixes, and when they come to an end, the next deal is likely to be more expensive. Some borrowers could be in for a \u201cpayment shock\u201d if they fail to remortgage and find themselves on their lender\u2019s standard variable rate. Santander, for example, is likely to raise its SVR from 4.49% to 4.74%. Separate analysis by the Resolution Foundation shows that in reality only 11% of UK households are immediately affected by the rate rise, compared to 19% a decade ago \u2013 because home ownership has declined, and so many of those with mortgages are now on fixed rates. Will interest rates continue to go up? The consensus in the City is that there will be at least another 0.25% rate rise next year, and possibly a second. That will take Bank of England base rate to 1%. In the longer term there is talk of the Bank of England \u201cnormalising\u201d rates after the most abnormal decade in its history. But few mainstream economists expect the \u201cnew normal\u201d to be much above 3%. If rates continue marching up, what will happen to my repayments then? Two quarter-point rate rises will add \u00a367 a month take the cost of a \u00a3175,000 mortgage \u2013 bad, but probably not catastrophic for most households. But if base rate hits 3%, that cost goes up by a far more painful \u00a3260 a month for the average borrower. After the 2007/08 crash, the Financial Conduct Authority enforced strict affordability rules to ensure that borrowers could withstand rate rises. Thursday\u2019s rate rise will be the first test of how those rules are working. Will it hit house prices? Any rate rise knocks confidence in the property market, although no one can know by how much. This week Nationwide reported house prices crept up by 0.4% in October \u2013 even though most buyers would have known a rate rise was in the offing. Ashley Osborne, head of UK residential at Colliers International said: \u201cWe\u2019re not expecting any significant impact on property prices. For months now buyers have been pricing in an expectation that rates will rise, and people are fixing their mortgages for longer than in the past.\u201d I have a buy-to-let mortgage. What will happen to them? Base rate rises have a magnified effect upon landlords, who almost certainly have an interest-only mortgage, unlike conventional buyers who are forced to have repayment mortgages. A 0.25% rise in a \u00a3200,000 interest-only buy-to-let deal results in a \u00a340 extra monthly cost compared with \u00a325 on a repayment mortgage. Will savings rates finally begin to improve? While banks always raise mortgage rates immediately, rises in savings rates tend to come later. But some lenders have already said they will pass on the 0.25% rise to savers. In Nationwide\u2019s case, it said the \u201cmajority\u201d of savers will see improvements. Newcastle building society added it will pass on the rate rise in full to all its savers. But bear in mind that banks are generally not chasing after savers\u2019 cash (they are still benefiting from government and Bank of England schemes to fund them) which means that most savers will continue to struggle to earn any more than 1% interest on a standard bank Isa.

      "bodyText": "The Bank of England is on track to raise interest rates for the first time in more than a decade on Thursday after data from manufacturers strengthened the case for an increase. The industrial sector is reporting that it remains in rude health as companies benefited from strong sales in the UK last month and new export business driven by the weak pound. Combined with high inflation and record low unemployment, the figures pointed to the Bank raising the cost of borrowing from 0.25% to 0.5%. \u201cThe continued robust health of manufacturing and rising price pressures will help cement expectations of the Bank of England hiking interest rates for the first time in a decade,\u201d said Rob Dobson, a director at IHS Markit, which compiled the manufacturing data. Factory output and new orders rose at \u201crobust rates\u201d last month, IHS Markit said on Wednesday. The sector has expanded for most of the year, according to the firm\u2019s monthly survey, in response to the fall in the value of the pound, which has boosted trade, especially with booming markets in the European Union. Forecasts that the global economy, which has expanded strongly this year, will continue to grow in 2018 have also provided factory owners with the security they need to expand production. Against this backdrop, the Bank\u2019s interest rate-setting committee is expected to raise its base rate in a bid to to calm inflation, which reached 3% in September. If it increases borrowing costs, the monetary policy committee is also expected to cite the lowest level of unemployment for 40 years, the continuing strength of the manufacturing and services sectors, which between them account for more than 90% of economic activity, and the need to curb a surge in consumer borrowing. Strong performances from the manufacturing and services industries also indicate that the UK can withstand an increase in rates without derailing the economy. However, there were signs of pressure in the retail sector \u2013 a key area of the economy \u2013 on Wednesday after Next reported a fall in high street sales in October. Next\u2019s figures came days after business group the CBI warned that high street sales are falling at their fastest rate since the height of the recession in 2009. The warnings point to soft consumer confidence and difficult trading conditions in the run-up to the crucial Christmas selling period. Some analysts said October\u2019s broader rise in factory output, which pushed the IHS Markit/CIPS survey to 56.3 from 56 the previous month \u2013 with any reading above 50 indicating growth \u2013 was based on a boost to domestic orders that was likely to prove short-lived. Nonetheless, Britain\u2019s biggest building society paved the way for across-the-board increases in mortgage costs this week by outlining how it would react to a rate rise. Nationwide announced that a 0.25% interest rate rise would be passed on in full to its 600,000-plus variable-rate home loan customers. That would add \u00a322 a month to the monthly mortgage bill for someone with a \u00a3175,000 mortgage, or \u00a351 a month for a customer with a \u00a3400,000 home loan, assuming they are on Nationwide\u2019s \u201cbase mortgage rate\u201d and have a 25-year term. There are as many as 5 million people on variable-rate mortgages in the UK. Deutsche Bank has predicted that the UK economy will slump next year from 1.6% GDP growth in 2017 to 1% in 2018, \u201cdue to weak household income and slowing jobs and house price growth\u201d. And the situation could worsen if households come to see Brexit as a permanent shock, forcing them to act as they did following the 2008 crash by increasing savings and cutting back hard on discretionary spending, the bank said.",

Combined with high inflation and record low unemployment, the figures pointed to the Bank raising the cost of borrowing from 0.25% to 0.5%. </p> <p>\u201cThe continued robust health of manufacturing and rising price pressures will help cement expectations of the Bank of England hiking interest rates for the first time in a decade,\u201d said Rob Dobson, a director at IHS Markit, which compiled the manufacturing data. </p> <p>Factory output and new orders rose at \u201crobust rates\u201d last month, IHS Markit said on Wednesday. The sector has expanded for most of the year, according to the firm\u2019s monthly survey, in response to the fall in the value of the pound, which has boosted trade, especially with booming markets in the European Union.</p> <p>Forecasts that the global economy, which has expanded strongly this year, will continue to grow in 2018 have also provided factory owners with the security they need to expand production.</p> <p>Against this backdrop, the Bank\u2019s interest rate-setting committee is expected to raise its base rate in a bid to to calm inflation, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/oct/17/uk-inflation-at-five-year-high-of-3-to-boost-state-pension\">which reached 3% in September</a>. If it increases borrowing costs, the monetary policy committee is also expected to cite the lowest level of unemployment for 40 years, the continuing strength of the manufacturing and services sectors, which between them account for more than 90% of economic activity, and the need to curb a surge in consumer borrowing. Strong performances from the manufacturing and services industries also indicate that the UK can withstand an increase in rates without derailing the economy.</p> <p>However, there were signs of pressure in the retail sector \u2013 a key area of the economy \u2013 on Wednesday after Next reported a fall in high street sales in October. Next\u2019s figures came days after business group the CBI warned that high street sales are falling <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/oct/26/alarm-sounds-over-state-of-uk-high-street-as-sales-crash\">at their fastest rate since the height of the recession in 2009</a>. The warnings point to soft consumer confidence and difficult trading conditions in the run-up to the crucial Christmas selling period.</p> <p>Some analysts said October\u2019s broader rise in factory output, which pushed the IHS Markit/CIPS survey to 56.3 from 56 the previous month \u2013 with any reading above 50 indicating growth \u2013 was based on a boost to domestic orders that was likely to prove short-lived.</p> <p>Nonetheless, Britain\u2019s biggest building society paved the way for across-the-board increases in mortgage costs this week by outlining how it would react to a rate rise. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/nationwide\">Nationwide</a> announced that a 0.25% interest rate rise <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/culture\">would be passed on in full to its 600,000-plus variable-rate home loan customers</a>.</p> <p>That would add \u00a322 a month to the monthly mortgage bill for someone with a \u00a3175,000 mortgage, or \u00a351 a month for a customer with a \u00a3400,000 home loan, assuming they are on Nationwide\u2019s \u201cbase mortgage rate\u201d and have a 25-year term. There are <a href=\"https://www.cml.org.uk/news/news-and-views/are-mortgage-borrowers-prepared-for-rising-interest-rates/\">as many as 5 million people on variable-rate mortgages</a> in the UK. </p> <p>Deutsche Bank has predicted that the UK economy will slump next year from 1.6% GDP growth in 2017 to 1% in 2018, \u201cdue to weak household income and slowing jobs and house price growth\u201d. And the situation could worsen if households come to see Brexit as a permanent shock, forcing them to act as they did following the 2008 crash by increasing savings and cutting back hard on discretionary spending, the bank said.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Adani\u2019s proposed Carmichael coalmine may end up being bankrolled by the Chinese-state-owned enterprise China Machinery Engineering Corporation (CMEC), according to public statements. The statements raise questions about the role of any potential Australian government loan through the Northern Australian Infrastructure Facility (Naif) or Efic, since it could, in effect, be subsidising a Chinese government enterprise and potentially come with requirements for supporting employment in China rather than Australia. In a press release from January 2017, CMEC announced its president, Zhang Chun, had met with a delegation from Adani, as well as David Overall, the CEO of the Australian mining construction company Downer EDI. Downer EDI told the ASX it received letters informing it of Adani\u2019s intent to contract the company for the construction of the mine and associated infrastructure but that no binding contract had been entered into. Following the meeting, the press release said CEMC \u201choped to cooperate with Adani and Downer to take part in financing, construction and operation of relevant coalmines and railway projects\u201d. Tim Buckley from the pro-renewables Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis said since that time negotiations had progressed and \u201cCMEC is still negotiating to be potentially involved as a contractor and financier for the proposed Carmichael rail project\u201d. Buckley said once CEMC was involved, it could get the project access to additional financing from the state-owned China Construction Bank and Export-Import Bank of China. The possibility was highlighted in October when Jeyakumar Janakaraj, the chief executive officer of Adani Australia, told Reuters the company was in talks to secure loans from export credit agencies. Last week it was revealed that Australian federal ministers had written a formal letter to China\u2019s government to confirm that the controversial coal project had passed all necessary environmental approvals. Frances Adamson, the secretary of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, told a Senate estimates hearing last week that Adani may have requested the letter to help it secure funding from the Chinese. \u201cMy interpretation of what would have happened is the Adani company will have themselves been assessing how they can fund the project [and] in the course of that assessment they\u2019ve looked at a range of different sources and I think what they did was request a statement of fact, if you like, from the Australian government which the Australian government, given its support for the project, ministers were happy to provide,\u201d she told the Senate estimates hearing. The attorney general, George Brandis, said the government wrote the letter, signed by the minister for trade, Steve Ciobo, \u201cto dispel the misinformation campaign of those from the radical left\u201d. \u201cThe Australian government continues to welcome foreign investment that is in our national interest, including the Adani investment in the Carmichael mine project,\u201d Brandis said. Buckley said if the Australian government subsidised the coalmine by providing a loan for the construction of its rail link, it could effectively be subsidising the Chinese government. The role of Naif is to \u201cde-risk\u201d ventures so that private sector investors can fund projects \u2013 in this case the de-risking would be for the benefit of the Chinese government. Additionally, if the Chinese Export Credit Agency or China Construction Bank were to be involved, Buckley said the loans would almost certainly come with requirements for jobs to be generated in China, since the main role of those organisations was to create economic benefit for the home country. \u201cA Chinese SOE investment would secure Chinese jobs for equipment and manufacturing in China and service supply in Australia,\u201d he said. \u201cThis further weakens the justification that the Australian political support for the Carmichael coal and rail projects is based on the local Queensland jobs Adani have claimed it will create.\u201d",
