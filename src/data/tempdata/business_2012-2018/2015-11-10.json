      "bodyText": "US authorities have charged four men with orchestrating \u201cthe largest theft of customer data from a US financial institution in history\u201d in indictments unsealed on Tuesday. The \u201cmassive computer hacking crimes\u201d affected 100 million people and targeted employees, databases and customers of JP Morgan Chase, Dow Jones and Fidelity Investments. Fidelity has said that no customer information or related systems were breached. Twelve victims spanning the globe are identified by pseudonym (\u201cVictim-1, Victim-9\u201d) in the indictment. The accused are Israelis Gery Shalon, the self-described founder of the group, and Ziv Orenstein, along with Americans Joshua Aaron, who is still at large, and Anthony Murgio. Manhattan US attorney Preet Bharara said the three were responsible for \u201cone of the largest cyber hacking schemes ever uncovered\u201d. He said their hacking was \u201cbreathtaking\u201d in size and scope. Shalon, who allegedly called his stock-inflation scheme \u201ca small step towards a large empire\u201d, ran what officials describe as \u201ca sprawling cybercriminal enterprise\u201d with \u201chundreds of employees, co-conspirators and infrastructure in over a dozen countries\u201d. Shalon is said to have described the plot himself to an unnamed co-conspirator: \u201cWe buy [stocks] very cheap, perform machinations, then play with them.\u201d But, wondered the anonymous confederate, is playing the market really that popular in the US? \u201cIt\u2019s like drinking freaking vodka in Russia,\u201d Shalon answered. The vast organization sold counterfeit pharmaceuticals, malware, and ran an elaborate and technical con to bypass checks on illicit debit and credit card transactions in order to shield their customers from the law, disguising criminals giving and receiving payments as wedding dress and pet supply stores. The globetrotting conspiracy hacked servers in Egypt, the Czech Republic, South Africa and Brazil, among other countries, in one instance exploiting the notorious Heartbleed bug. The unnamed team-mate then installed malware on the servers, providing the group with \u201cpersistent access\u201d to the victim companies\u2019 networks, allowing them to steal data as they wanted it, sometimes over months. Then, with personal information harvested from those networks \u2013 and with access to the emails of \u201ctop managers\u201d at financial institutions \u2013 the group began emailing people it believed could be fooled into investing in stocks the organization would artificially inflate. It also began targeting companies to \u201cpump and dump\u201d. The group convinced some private companies to offer their shares publicly. To avoid arousing suspicion, Shalon would engage in \u201creverse mergers\u201d with internationally traded shell corporations he controlled and operated. Then the group would carefully shore up the prices of the stocks by buying them on successive days. Shalon and his group would send phony \u201ctips\u201d on the rising share price via email spam sent to millions of people, and cash out when the price was high enough, causing the stocks of the companies they had tricked into going public to crater. The group earned millions of dollars this way. They also marketed their illegal online casinos with the same multimillion-account email spam lists. \u201cThrough the casino companies, Shalon, Orenstein and their co-conspirators generated hundreds of millions of dollars in unlawful income, at a minimum,\u201d wrote Bharara in the indictment, \u201cearning up to millions of dollars of profits each month.\u201d Shalon and his partners also orchestrated attacks against fellow online casinos, stealing customer information executives emails and even crippling competitors with distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks. According to the US Department of Justice, the hack is now connected to the shutdown of bitcoin exchange Coin.mx in July \u2013 just one of multiple money-laundering businesses run by the organization. Andy Yen, formerly of Swiss research center Cern and now of encrypted email company ProtonMail, said his own company had experienced an especially strong DDoS attack and that it was important not to keep hackers out of the network, but to safeguard the networks from within. \u201cHistorically, companies have put their security focus on reinforcing the \u2018wall\u2019 which keep attackers out, but with attackers growing more and more sophisticated, it is no longer a question of if you will be breached, but when you will be breached,\u201d Yen said. \u201cThis is why we need increasing adoption of the end-to-end encryption paradigm, where data is encrypted and secured client side. This ensures that even in the event of a breach of a central server, sensitive client data can be kept safe.\u201d Michael Kaiser, head of the National Cyber Security Alliance, said he expected crimes like this to become more common. \u201cI don\u2019t think this is an anomaly at all,\u201d Kaiser said. \u201cI think the cybercrime ecosystem is highly sophisticated. It\u2019s also specialized. There are some folks who are good at gathering the data, others are good at monetizing it. This is not just about stealing some credit cards and cloning them and using them a few times before they get canceled. This had many technical aspects. It involved casinos and stock trading.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Asda, owned by US chain Walmart, claims the non-existent credit for importing Black Friday shopping mayhem to the UK. Now it wishes to slay the monster it created and is scaling back the annual sales promotion. As is the way with retailers, Asda\u2019s chief executive, Andy Clarke, claims to be responding to what customers want. It would be more honest to say the supermarket cannot risk a repeat of last year\u2019s shambles, which led senior police officers to condemn shoppers for their idiotic behaviour and retail executives for their lack of planning. Black Friday has always seemed pointless from a retailer\u2019s point of view. Any fool can flog flatscreen TVs for little or no profit. But why bother? There is no evidence that hosting a glorified car boot sale turns opportunistic customers into loyalists. Non-participants, and those disinclined to throw a punch to secure an espresso machine, are annoyed by the return to full pricing. Collapsing websites add to the general air of aggravation. Clarke, in an heroic attempt not to admit to a U-turn, said: \u201cWhen it comes to putting customers first, Asda has always led the way, which is why we\u2019re just as confident in our decision to step away from Black Friday as we were in introducing it to the UK.\u201d Translation: we shot ourselves in the foot. Nasdaq listing offers shot in the arm for Chi-Med The Alternative Investment Market (Aim) has spawned so many upsets and scandals over the years that it is only proper to note a tale of genuine success. Hutchison China MediTech arrived in London in 2006 at 275p in 2006, dipped as low as 40p in the market turmoil of 2008-09, and currently trades at almost \u00a327 per share. Valued at \u00a31.5bn, it is the third largest company by capitalisation on the Aim market. Never heard of it? Chi-Med started life as Hong Kong billionaire Li Ka-shing\u2019s attempt to build a Chinese pharmaceutical company capable of developing drugs to western standards. It sounded a long-shot because the gulf in pharmaceutical culture, tradition and practice seemed enormous; no Chinese citizen had won a Nobel prize for medicine until this year, for example. Yet Chi-Med has defied the doubters. It has attracted premier-league partners such as AstraZeneca and Eli Lilly in oncology and Nestl\u00e9 Health Science in immunology. The company has seven potential compounds with a chance of becoming the first drug developed in China to be approved in the west for decades. There are no guarantees of success, of course, but pharma specialists who follow the results from clinical trials and the arrival of milestone payments from partners see real promise. Sadly, however, Chi-Med\u2019s rise has happened under the radar. Asos, the online clothes retailer that is Aim\u2019s biggest stock, attracts constant attention and a healthy following among analysts. Chi-Med, by contrast, could almost be invisible; even one of its house brokers suspended coverage. In the circumstances, you can\u2019t blame the company for deciding that the next stage of its development is best funded out of the US. This week\u2019s shareholder meeting gave formal approval for a joint listing on Nasdaq, the world\u2019s biggest and most liquid market for biotech investment. Since the plan was announced last month Chi-Med\u2019s shares have gained 40%. In short, US markets place a higher value on innovation and have devoted specialist funds. GW Pharma was another Aim-listed pharma pioneer to take the Nasdaq road in recent years. Chi-Med\u2019s chief executive, Christian Hogg, isn\u2019t bitter about his experience in London: \u201cAim has been a very good platform for us,\u201d he says. Very generous. But, once upon a time, London had hopes of sustaining growth companies like Chi-Med until they had grown up. Instead, US dominance in funding startup pharma development is stronger than it has ever been. The City has fluffed an opportunity, and betting on Asos\u2019s next quarterly sales update won\u2019t fill the void. Exciting parting gift from National Grid chief Good news, the lights will stay on this winter, or so National Grid expects. Now here\u2019s the exciting farewell present to shareholders from the company\u2019s chief executive, Steve Holliday \u2013 the group will sell a majority stake in its UK gas transmission business, which operates 82,000 miles of pipeline and serves 10.9m customers. Pumping gas, it seems, is too dull, even for National Grid, which sees better growth opportunities elsewhere. This analysis may alarm investors who love the company precisely for its dullness and inflation-matching (or beating) dividends. But they shouldn\u2019t fret too much \u2013 it seems likely that some infrastructure fund or another will offer a pretty price above the regulatory value of \u00a38.5bn. The proceeds will be returned to shareholders, so successor John Pettigrew does not have a licence to splurge. What he does have, though, is a challenge to ensure Grid does not suffer in the next instalment of the UK\u2019s unpredictable energy policy. In theory, Grid wins if more electricity generating capacity, and thus transmission investment, is required. In practice, anything is possible these days.",

Collapsing websites add to the general air of aggravation.</p> <p>Clarke, in an heroic attempt not to admit to a U-turn, said: \u201cWhen it comes to putting customers first, Asda has always led the way, which is why we\u2019re just as confident in our decision to step away from Black Friday as we were in introducing it to the UK.\u201d </p> <p>Translation: we shot ourselves in the foot.</p> <h2>Nasdaq listing offers shot in the arm for Chi-Med</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"81a5e455b8693740a439f1518e8588f9e0f774c0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/81a5e455b8693740a439f1518e8588f9e0f774c0/0_95_3250_1950/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Chi-Med\u2019s ascent has happened under the radar.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Chi-Med\u2019s ascent has happened under the radar.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Cheskin/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The Alternative Investment Market (Aim) has spawned so many upsets and scandals over the years that it is only proper to note a tale of genuine success. Hutchison China MediTech arrived in London in 2006 at 275p in 2006, dipped as low as 40p in the market turmoil of 2008-09, and currently trades at almost \u00a327 per share. Valued at \u00a31.5bn, it is the third largest company by capitalisation on the Aim market.</p> <p>Never heard of it? Chi-Med started life as Hong Kong billionaire Li Ka-shing\u2019s attempt to build a Chinese pharmaceutical company capable of developing drugs to western standards. It sounded a long-shot because the gulf in pharmaceutical culture, tradition and practice seemed enormous; no Chinese citizen had won a Nobel prize for medicine until this year, for example.</p> <p>Yet Chi-Med has defied the doubters. It has attracted premier-league partners such as AstraZeneca and Eli Lilly in oncology and Nestl\u00e9 Health Science in immunology. The company has seven potential compounds with a chance of becoming the first drug developed in China to be approved in the west for decades. There are no guarantees of success, of course, but pharma specialists who follow the results from clinical trials and the arrival of milestone payments from partners see real promise.</p> <p>Sadly, however, Chi-Med\u2019s rise has happened under the radar. Asos, the online clothes retailer that is Aim\u2019s biggest stock, attracts constant attention and a healthy following among analysts. Chi-Med, by contrast, could almost be invisible; even one of its house brokers suspended coverage.</p> <p>In the circumstances, you can\u2019t blame the company for deciding that the next stage of its development is best funded out of the US. This week\u2019s shareholder meeting gave formal approval for a joint listing on Nasdaq, the world\u2019s biggest and most liquid market for biotech investment. Since the plan was announced last month Chi-Med\u2019s shares have gained 40%. In short, US markets place a higher value on innovation and have devoted specialist funds. GW Pharma was another Aim-listed pharma pioneer to take the Nasdaq road in recent years.</p> <p>Chi-Med\u2019s chief executive, Christian Hogg, isn\u2019t bitter about his experience in London: \u201cAim has been a very good platform for us,\u201d he says. Very generous. But, once upon a time, London had hopes of sustaining growth companies like Chi-Med until they had grown up. Instead, US dominance in funding startup pharma development is stronger than it has ever been. The City has fluffed an opportunity, and betting on Asos\u2019s next quarterly sales update won\u2019t fill the void.</p> <h2>Exciting parting gift from National Grid chief</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6e33bf9ea2d76d4541a6d22a48259e55f1b233bd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6e33bf9ea2d76d4541a6d22a48259e55f1b233bd/0_252_3500_2099/1000.jpg\" alt=\"National Grid operates 82,000 miles of pipeline and serves 10.9 million customers.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">National Grid operates 82,000 miles of pipeline and serves 10.9 million customers.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andrew Milligan/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Good news, the lights will stay on this winter, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/nov/10/national-grid-plays-down-fears-of-power-crunch-and-blackouts\">or so National Grid expects.</a> Now here\u2019s the exciting farewell present to shareholders from the company\u2019s chief executive, Steve Holliday \u2013 the group will sell a majority stake in its UK gas transmission business, which operates 82,000 miles of pipeline and serves 10.9m customers.</p> <p>Pumping gas, it seems, is too dull, even for National Grid, which sees better growth opportunities elsewhere. This analysis may alarm investors who love the company precisely for its dullness and inflation-matching (or beating) dividends. But they shouldn\u2019t fret too much \u2013 it seems likely that some infrastructure fund or another will offer a pretty price above the regulatory value of \u00a38.5bn.</p> <p>The proceeds will be returned to shareholders, so successor John Pettigrew does not have a licence to splurge. What he does have, though, is a challenge to ensure Grid does not suffer in the next instalment of the UK\u2019s unpredictable energy policy. In theory, Grid wins if more electricity generating capacity, and thus transmission investment, is required. In practice, anything is possible these days.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Between the tropics and probably as far as the 33rd parallel, the sun could soon be a major source of energy for households and businesses alike. Countries such as Mexico and Indonesia, long dependent on cheap home-produced oil and coal, are realising that a solar panel on every roof can reduce poverty by lowering energy costs as well as minimising the destabilising weather effects from higher CO2 emissions. As the International Energy Agency (IEA) says in its World Energy Outlook 2015, the tumbling cost of installing photovoltaics, as much as a commitment to limiting climate change, is persuading these populous countries to switch to renewables. It predicts a cumulative $7.4trn global investment in renewable energy by 2040. Indonesia has forged ahead by limiting investment subsidies that have underpinned coal, oil and gas production for decades. China is also beginning to make the switch to renewables while moving away from dirty, energy-intensive industries. The result, says the IEA, could limit the demand for oil and keep the price relatively low for the rest of the decade. By 2030, the share of low-carbon power generation could grow to almost 45%, putting a lid on power emissions and containing a 40% rise in energy demand. But global investment in renewable energy may not be as large as it seems. The IEA\u2019s $7.4trn figure represents only 15% of the total investment in global energy supply by 2040. So oil, coal and gas are still a major part of the energy mix 25 years from now. And predictions of a low oil price \u2013 possibly no more than $80 a barrel stretching beyond 2020 \u2013 could be upset by India. By 2040, the IEA says, the country\u2019s energy demand will almost match that of the US, even though demand per head will remain 40% below the world average. Without a push to adopt renewables, India\u2019s galloping demand for energy could send oil and gas prices spiralling up and scupper any hopes of limiting CO2 emissions. Should it invest in solar farms, India must persuade hundreds of millions of car drivers to ditch their petrol vehicles and thousands of road hauliers their diesel trucks, a stumbling block that could be beyond its democratically elected leaders.",

    "webTitle": "Fight for $15 targets politicians in bid to take minimum wage to the ballot box", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "It was still dark outside when hundreds of workers gathered in Brooklyn on Tuesday morning to once again push for a federally mandated minimum wage of $15 an hour. This time, three years after the Fight for $15 movement was born, the target audience of the workers in Brooklyn and elsewhere across the US were politicians, instead of just their employers. The workers\u2019 signs bore a plain but direct message: Vote for $15. \u201cI felt incredibly inspired to be here, in Brooklyn where it all started in November 2012,\u201d said Mary Kay Henry, president of SEIU, one of the largest labor unions in the US. According to her, the New York workers, who were part of the movement since the very beginning, are best suited to be \u201cmissionaries\u201d to tell the story of why government needs to be part of solution to raise the wage. This year, a wage board commissioned by New York governor Andrew Cuomo recommended that a minimum wage for fast food workers employed by chains with 30 or more stores nationwide be paid at least $15 an hour. And while wages for fast food workers are set to gradually increase to $15 an hour in coming years, many of New York City workers are still being left behind. \u201cWe have well over a million people who don\u2019t make $15 an hour. A million people trying to struggle to get by, and this movement shined a light on that reality and said we are not going to go on like that,\u201d New York City mayor Bill de Blasio told the crowd as sun began to rise and light rain started to fall. He added that the Fight for $15 movement \u201chad already changed this city and nation\u201d. De Blasio\u2019s remarks were echoed by former secretary of state and 2016 Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton. \u201cFast-food, home care, child care workers: Your advocacy is changing our country for the better,\u201d she tweeted, adding a #Fightfor15 hashtag. Earlier this year, she threw her support behind a bill proposed by Washington senator Patty Murray and Virginia congressman Bobby Scott to raise the federal minimum wage to $12 an hour by 2020. The fact that many US elected officials now support a $12 an hour wage is a testament to the movement, said Henry. She pointed out that politicians who previously supported a minimum wage of $9 an hour now support $12. \u201cIf we can expand our movement and take it to the ballot box, it could be the win that pushes elected officials higher,\u201d said Henry. Getting the issue to the ballot box means getting candidates to come out in support of the $15 minimum wage as well as getting minimum wage initiatives on the ballot come 8 November 2016. On Monday evening, just hours before the workers rallied at dawn, SEIU announced that it had collected enough signature to get an initiative to raise California\u2019s state minimum wage to $15 an hour on the November 2016 ballot. During the 2014 midterm election, voters in four different states voted in favor of ballot initiatives that would increase their state minimum wage. Clinton is not the only presidential candidate to speak in support of the movement. \u201cI support the #Fightfor15 and a $15 federal minimum wage. Let\u2019s get to $15 however and wherever we can!\u201d tweeted Democratic presidential candidate Martin O\u2019Malley, who has previously come out in support of $15 minimum wage. Bernie Sanders, the Vermont senator and 2016 Democratic presidential candidate who also supports raising the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour, was slated to join the picket line outside the US Capitol on Tuesday morning. \u201cUS government shouldn\u2019t be America\u2019s leading low-wage job creator,\u201d said Sanders, speaking to a crowd of contract workers who cook and clean for the US government. \u201cThe federal government should lead by example and make sure taxpayer-subsidized federal contractor like Compass Group pay a living wage of $15 and allow workers to organize without retaliation.\u201d Compass Group, a large food service contractor that provides staff at the US Capitol cafeteria, referred Guardian\u2019s request for comment to its subsidiary Restaurant Associates. Restaurant Associates on Tuesday said all of their wages are in compliance with current laws. Some officials used Tuesday as an opportunity to announce new efforts to raise local wages. Cuomo used his executive authority to increase minimum wage for state workers in New York City to $15 by 2018. In the rest of the state, state workers\u2019 minimum wage will reach $15 by 2021. Pittsburgh mayor Bill Peduto also issued an executive order raising minimum wage for all city\u2019s employees to $15 by 2021. Not only did Tuesday mark one year before the presidential election, but it was also the day of the fourth Republican presidential debate. James Powell, who works as a chef at the Senate\u2019s members-only dining room and makes $13 an hour, would like the Republican presidential candidates like Florida senator Marco Rubio address US wages. The issue has barely been mentioned in the first three Republican debates. \u201cSenator Rubio promises to create good jobs for America, but he hasn\u2019t helped the low-wage workers who serve him every day,\u201d said Powell. \u201cHe likes the fancy dishes we prepare, but he doesn\u2019t care that we can\u2019t afford to feed ourselves.\u201d Not everyone, however, is a fan of the movement. As the crowd turned and marched past the municipal buildings in Brooklyn, a young African Americans woman emerged from the train station. Noticing the crowd, she paused and watched as they marched. Moments later, she shook her head and said: \u201cIt\u2019s too early for this crap.\u201d It was just after seven in the morning, and the Fight for $15 had a whole day of events left.",

A million people trying to struggle to get by, and this movement shined a light on that reality and said we are not going to go on like that,\u201d New York City mayor Bill de Blasio told the crowd as sun began to rise and light rain started to fall.

      "bodyText": "Investors remain concerned about a global slowdown and a concurrent US interest rate rise, leaving stock markets in an uncertain mood. Moody\u2019s warning on the knock on effects of slowing growth in China set the tone, along with a weaker than expected rise in the country\u2019s inflation. With Portugal facing new political upheaval and Greece struggling to meet its creditor\u2019s demands, the eurozone crisis was also back in focus. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished down 19.88 points or 0.32% at 6275.28 Germany\u2019s Dax edged up 0.16% to 10,832.52 France\u2019s Cac closed up 0.02% at 4912.16 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB added 1.52% to 22,444.00 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended up 0.11% at 10,336.8 In Greece the Athens market fell 1.65% to 672.19 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 25 points or 0.15%. On that note, it\u2019s time to close up for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. New payments for Greece will be released as soon as households\u2019 insolvency issues are resolved; the decision is going to be taken next Monday, said Eurogroup president Dijsselbloem told MEPs. \u201cThe Greek problem will stay with us for many more years but we can cope with that\u201d, he added. A report on the meeting is here: Nonperforming loans block the payments to Greece, Dijsselbloem tells MEPs Outside Portugal\u2019s parliament, demonstrators at an anti-austerity protest by labor groups shouted \u201cVictory!\u201d as the news of the vote spread, reports AP. Here\u2019s Associated Press: Anti-austerity lawmakers have forced Portugal\u2019s new center-right government to resign by rejecting its policy proposals. The showdown comes less than two weeks after the center-right government was sworn in. The moderate Socialist Party forged an unprecedented alliance with the Communist Party and the radical Left Bloc to get a majority in the 230-seat Parliament and vote down the proposals on Tuesday. After four years in power the government lost its parliamentary majority in an October 4 general election, which saw a public backlash against austerity measures adopted following a \u20ac78bn ($84bn) bailout in 2011. Socialist leader Antonio Costa is expected to become prime minister in coming weeks, supported by the Communists and Left Bloc. The have promised to alleviate austerity, though critics fear a return to borrow-and-spend policies. Reacting to the news from Portugal, Capital Economics said: Today\u2019s vote of no confidence in the Portuguese Government seems set to usher in a renewed push against austerity and a further rise in bond yields. The one hope is that mounting public resistance to austerity will at some point lead the European authorities to allow a more growth-friendly approach. And the Portuguese government has fallen: Portugal has begin the vote of confidence in parliament: Greek government officials are expressing confidence that the thorniest of all questions dividing Athens from its creditors \u2013 the issue of home repossessions - is about to be solved. Our correspondent Helena Smith reports: Both Athens and its creditors are \u201cvery close\u201d to finding the right formula that would protect mortgage holders from losing homes and close negotiations between the two sides. That is according to senior government officials who say foreign lenders are ever closer to agreeing that the ceiling for protecting homes in the event of loan repayment failure should be nearer the \u20ac200,000 mark than the \u20ac300,000 mark at which it currently stands. \u201cThe goal is to conclude negotiations within the week,\u201d said one high level source insisting that thousands would stand to lose their primary residences if agreement wasn\u2019t reached. \u201cIn so far as the first residence is concerned [consensus] is very close to the Greek government\u2019s proposal,\u201d added the official saying both sides had begun to converge on the issue of income criteria and how that would affect foreclosures. If talks were wrapped up this week, the aid disbursement and recapitalization of banks could begin next week, insiders say. Amid a groundswell of criticism at home and abroad, Greece\u2019s leftist government is keen to put on a brave face. In that spirit, the finance minister Euclid Tsakalotos will address an audience at the LSE tonight with a talk appropriately entitled \u201cEconomic blues: the left in government times.\u201d Apparently the interest is such, there is no auditorium big enough to hold the event according to the Hellenic Observatory organising it. Back with Greece and Klaus Regling, managing director of the European Stability Mechanism bailout fund, has ruled out a haircut or debt relief for the country. In an interview here he said: A nominal haircut is certainly not on the cards and the IMF is not proposing it either. In my view, there is also no need for such measures. Let me explain why. Greece today already has benefitted significantly from loans from the ESM and the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF). We disbursed about \u20ac143 billion, which corresponds to 45% of all Greek debt. We did that on very favourable terms. These loans have an average maturity of 32 years and a very low interest rate of currently about 1% because we charge only our own low funding cost. These generous lending terms save the Greek budget huge amounts of money every year. These gains - in what economists call net present value terms - are so substantial that they are very similar to a haircut from a Greek perspective. If you add up all favourable terms made in the European official lending, the benefit is equivalent to a 50% haircut from a Greek perspective. But this is very different from a nominal haircut. Crucially, our approach neither leads to any loss for creditors nor to any direct transfer from creditors to Greece. The ESM could improve these financing conditions further provided Greece fully sticks to its reform commitments. For example, we could extend maturities or prolong the interest rate deferral. Member states will look at the reform implementation in Greece and decide whether to engage into discussions on further debt relief. We need to bear in mind that already today Greece\u2019s debt service in terms of gross domestic product is below that of other European countries and there are almost no payments to us until 2023. He also said: Trade unions protesting against the austerity measures in Portugal as the government faces a confidence vote in parliament. Over in Portugal: US markets have slipped back in early trading, as the fears of a slowdown in China and the prospect of a rate rise from the Federal Reserve in December dampen investor enthusiasm once more. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently dow 29 points or 0.17%, with Apple down around 2.5% on worries about weak demand for its iPhone 6s. Analysts at Credit Suisse reported that Apple had cut its orders for components by as much as 10%. Greece\u2019s prime minister Alexis Tsipras has told his cabinet to complete talks with the country\u2019s lenders swiftly this week to allow the release of the latest tranche of bailout money, Reuters is reporting. The two sides have been in dispute over home foreclosures and non-performing loans. Reuters says: In the first major standoff with lenders since their being re-elected to office in September, Greek officials were told by eurozone finance ministers on Monday Athens would not get any more aid until it implemented a series of reforms, foremost among them being a tighter foreclosures law on problem mortgages. Tsipras told cabinet it was a \u201cpriority\u201d to conclude negotiations this week to allow the disbursement of \u20ac2bn in aid, and another \u20ac10bn to be released towards the recapitalisation of Greece\u2019s four systemic banks. \u201cHe noted it was a priority to conclude negotiations this week, so as to facilitate approval ...for the disbursement,\u201d a statement from his office said. Discussions have stumbled on the level of protection Greek mortgage holders should have if they fail to repay their debt. A government source said that negotiations with lenders were continuing, and there appeared to be a level of convergence emerging. More on the falling euro: In Portugal, parliament is debating the government\u2019s programme ahead of a confidence vote. US import prices fell in October by more than expected, helped by the continuing weakness in the crude price and a strong dollar. They dropped 0.5% compared to expectations of a 0.1% fall and a 0.6% decline in September, itself revised down from 0.1%. However traders believe this is unlikely to prevent the Federal Reserve from raising interest rates in December, which it seems increasingly keen to do. The euro has hit a seven month-low against the US dollar, as monetary policy on either side of the Atlantic prepares to diverge. The single currency has fallen by half a cent this morning, to hit $1.0697. That\u2019s its lowest level since mid-April. The dollar is buoyant right now, after last week\u2019s strong US jobs report raised the chances that the Federal Reserve hikes interest rates in December. The euro, though, is weak as investors anticipate fresh stimulus measures from the ECB soon. The political turmoil in Lisbon isn\u2019t helping either. Richard Perry, sales trader at ETX Capital, says: The Euro remains weak as Portuguese government bond yields hit a four-month high after the Socialist party reached an agreement with the radical Left-bloc and the Greens on forming a united bloc to try and oust the recently-formed centre-right government. Few people are ever allowed deep into Britain\u2019s central bank, so my colleagues Larry Elliott and Jill Treanor had a real treat recently when they spent a week inside the Bank of England. They had remarkable access, from the governor\u2019s \u201ccavernous office\u201d to the bowels of the Bank, its vaults groaning with cash and gold. They saw how the Bank handles its responsibilities, which have swelled since the crisis, as it tries to avoid missing the next crash or fuelling another bubble. And they travel with top staff around the country as they assess the state of the economy, and weigh in on the Brexit debate. Enjoy yourselves: The wheels are in motion in Portugal, with the opposition left-wing parties preparing to vote down the centre-right government. Germany and Greece are at opposite ends of the eurozone spectrum, but they\u2019re both suffering industrial action this week. Germany\u2019s flagship airline, Lufthansa, has been forced to cancel 136 flights today as a cabin crew strike continues. Workers are protesting about Lufthansa\u2019s attempts to cut pension costs, disrupting tens of thousands of customers. And the situation is worsening, with unions expanding the walkout to cover the company\u2019s total operation from Wednesday until Friday. While in Greece, unions are preparing to hold a 24-hour strike on Thursday against the government\u2019s pensions cuts, labour market reforms and other bailout measures. Ferry workers, who downed tools (anchors?) last week have just announced they\u2019ll take part too. We can expect a protest rally in Athens too. Moody\u2019s warning of global shockwaves from China has helped to push shares lower in Europe this morning. Most of the main indices are down, as traders fret that the world economy isn\u2019t strong enough to handle a US interest rate rise next month (as looks likely). This morning\u2019s fall in Chinese inflation to 1.3% has also hit the mood in the City, says Conner Campbell of SpreadEX: Despite starting the day with some mild gains, the wind was taken out of the market\u2019s sail this morning as Moody\u2019s issued an unwelcome reminder about the big trouble in (not so little) China. Hot on the heels of the country\u2019s inflation slip came a report from the ratings agency that claimed \u2018the main risks to the economic outlook are a bigger than expected global fallout from the Chinese slowdown\u2019. Not necessarily a surprising statement, but given the fact they had already had to endure China\u2019s aforementioned crumbling CPI investors were in no mood for another dour dollop of data reaffirming that the main market-bogeyman is just as terrifying as first thought.. Over in Lisbon, Portugal\u2019s prime minister looks resigned to his fate as MPs debate his government\u2019s programme ahead of this afternoon\u2019s confidence vote. Political analysts are broadly confidence that a coalition of three left-wing parties will dethrone Passos Coelho. That alliance could be strained, though, as the Socialist Party, which came second in October\u2019s election, is more mainstream than the two smaller groups: The Greek cabinet has met this morning, to discuss their next move after failing to receive new bailout funds from their euro partners last night. Alexis Tsipras must now decide whether to agree tougher new rules on defaulting mortgages and other bad loans. Protests are expected outside the Lisbon parliament today, as the government\u2019s fate is decided: Portugal\u2019s minority centre-right government could be entering its final act, less than a fortnight after being sworn in. MPs in Lisbon are now in session, and are likely to vote down the government\u2019s programme later today. A group of left-wing parties, who hold a majority of seats between them, could then form a new government. Last night, prime minister Pedro Passos Coelho claimed that an alliance of socialist, communist and other leftist parties would be \u201cruinous for Portugal\u201d. His centre-right party won the most seats, but was short of a majority. Greek banking shares are falling heavily today, after eurozone finance ministers declined to hand over bailout funds last night. The main Athens stock index has shed 1.5%, led by financial stocks such as Eurobank which has lost almost 20%: These banks are all due to share in up to \u20ac10bn of fresh capital from Europe, but that money won\u2019t be released until Greece has satisfied the remaining \u2018milestones\u2019 set with creditors. Last night, eurozone finance ministers said Athens must complete this task by the end of the week. That means the deadlock over which homes can be repossessed, or foreclosed, from defaulting mortgage holders must be broken fast. The world\u2019s top energy forecaster has predicted that oil prices will remain below $80 per barrel until the end of this decade, partly due to China\u2019s slowing economy. In its new annual report, the International Energy Agency predicted that the current glut of oil will probably linger until 2020. That means the price of crude, currently below $50 per barrel, will only rise slowly in the IEA\u2019s \u2018central scenario\u2019. And China\u2019s slowing economy is one key factor. The IEA says: The single largest energy demand growth story of recent decades is near its end: China\u2019s coal use reaches a plateau at close to today\u2019s levels, as its economy rebalances and overall energy demand growth slows, before declining. The watchdog also flags up that the world has made progress towards cleaner fuels, and renewable sources: There are clear signs that an energy transition is underway: renewables contributed almost half of the world\u2019s new power generation capacity in 2014 and have already become the second-largest source of electricity (after coal). The IEA also acknowledges that oil demand could be even weaker than its central view, meaning prices stay even lower for longer. That would be welcomed by consumers, but risks \u201cenergy-security concerns\u201d by heightening reliance on a small number of low-cost producers. Here\u2019s the full report. Bloomberg is reporting that three lawsuits have been filed against the European Central Bank in the German constitutional courts. They apparently all involve the ECB\u2019s quantitative easing programme (under which it is buying government and corporate debt). We don\u2019t have much detail yet, I\u2019m afraid. It is presumably tied into concerns that the ECB\u2019s bond-buying programme violates the rules banning monetary financing within the eurozone. Back in June, Germany\u2019s top constitutional judges approved another ECB bond-buying programme, dubbed OMT, which lets it buy the debt of a eurozone member if it risks being locked out of the financial markets. A new Chinese inflation report has also send alarm bells ringing this morning. China\u2019s consumer prices index rose by just 1.3% annually last month, which is the lowest level since May. That\u2019s another sign that demand is weakening. Asian markets fell after the data was released: The copper price highlights why Moody\u2019s is right to be worried about China. It is hovering around a six-year low today, after trade data released on Sunday showed sharp fall in Chinese imports and exports. That\u2019s a concern, as copper is seen as a benchmark for the health of the global economy. There are some minor shockwaves in the bond markets too, as left-wing parties prepare to take power in Portugal (as explained in the intro). Portuguese 10-year bonds have hit a new four-month low this morning;, with investors worrying that a new anti-austerity government will soon be pulling the levers in Lisbon. London financial newspaper City AM is alarmed by Moody\u2019s warning: China\u2019s slowdown also means that commodity prices are unlikely to rebound, after slumping to multi-year lows in 2015. Moody\u2019s says: A large inventory build-up, a slow supply response and muted demand from China and other key importers will all weigh on prices. And that will ripple into supply chains in emerging markets, and also hurt household income growth in developing nations. But this isn\u2019t the only reason to worry about emerging markets. Political crises could erupt in Moscow or Rio.... As well as weaker commodity prices, a range of country-specific factors will contribute to lower growth in emerging markets and could lead investors to reassess growth and return prospects in some countries. For example, political uncertainty will be a negative factor in Brazil and Russia and infrastructure shortages will hamper growth in South Africa. Escalating problems in emerging markets such as China will hold back world growth over the next two years, and could even threaten the stability of the global economy. That\u2019s the crux of a new report from Moody\u2019s this morning. The rating agency has warned that global growth will remain relatively weak - seven years on from the financial crisis - hampering efforts to ease the global debt crisis. And it fears that governments lack the ammunition to fight back if (or maybe when) the global economy hits the rocks again. There may simply be little little room to manoeuvre with new fiscal or monetary stimulus, given the measures already taken since 2008 and the pressure to cut deficits. Marie Diron, senior vice-president of credit policy at Moody\u2019s, explains: \u201cMuted global economic growth will not support a significant reduction in government debt or allow central banks to raise interest rates markedly.\u201d \u201cAuthorities lack the large fiscal and conventional monetary policy buffers to protect their economies from potential shocks.\u201d Moody\u2019s forecasts that GDP growth across the G20 developed nations will average 2.8% in 2015-17. That\u2019s well short of the 3.8% average recorded in the five years before the global financial crisis. And the big threat is that China\u2019s economy weakens even faster than expected. As Moody\u2019s warns: The main risks to the economic outlook would stem from a bigger than expected global fallout from the Chinese slowdown and a larger impact from tighter external and domestic financing conditions in other emerging markets. It already expects China\u2019s GDP growth to slow to just under 7% this year, then 6.3% in 2016 and 6.1% in 2017, as Beijing tries to rebalance its economy. If that process falters, the world economy could be in for a nasty shock... Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial market, the eurozone and business. The eurozone crisis is entering another phase this week, with a stand-off between Greece and its creditors and political upheaval in Portugal. As we covered in last night\u2019s liveblog, Greece has been given one week to push through unpopular rules on non-performing loans. If it doesn\u2019t make it easier to repossess homes from mortgage-holders in default, Athens won\u2019t get \u20ac2bn in loans and \u20ac10bn to recapitalise its banks. All sides insisted last night that progress is being made, but it\u2019s an alarming early hiccup for Greece\u2019s third bailout. The Greek cabinet is due to meet in Athens shortly to discuss the situation. There will be drama in Lisbon too today, when the parliament votes on the new centre-right government\u2019s legislative programme. Socialist MPs, who won a majority of seats last month, are expected to bring the administration crashing down. That would allow them to start rolling back some of the country\u2019s tough spending cuts and tax rises. It\u2019s not exactly a repeat of Alexis Tsipras\u2019s dramatic surge to power in Greece in January, but certainly a reminder that European-imposed austerity has its limits. Something for European finance ministers to ponder, as they arrive in Brussels for an Ecofin meeting today: We\u2019ll be tracking all the main events through the day....",

In my view, there is also no need for such measures. Let me explain why. Greece today already has benefitted significantly from loans from the ESM and the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF). We disbursed about \u20ac143 billion, which corresponds to 45% of all Greek debt. We did that on very favourable terms. These loans have an average maturity of 32 years and a very low interest rate of currently about 1% because we charge only our own low funding cost.</p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p>These generous lending terms save the Greek budget huge amounts of money every year. These gains - in what economists call net present value terms - are so substantial that they are very similar to a haircut from a Greek perspective. If you add up all favourable terms made in the European official lending, the benefit is equivalent to a 50% haircut from a Greek perspective. But this is very different from a nominal haircut. Crucially, our approach neither leads to any loss for creditors nor to any direct transfer from creditors to Greece.</p> <p>The ESM could improve these financing conditions further provided Greece fully sticks to its reform commitments. For example, we could extend maturities or prolong the interest rate deferral.

      "bodyText": "EasyJet is to introduce a loyalty scheme for frequent flyers, as the pioneering low-cost airline celebrates its 20th anniversary. The carrier announced its new Flight Club scheme on Tuesday as it continued to woo the short-haul business travel market despite increasing competition from low-cost rivals. Flight Club\u2019s invitation-only membership will begin next year and offer passengers benefits including more flexible tickets, price guarantees and a dedicated customer service team. Hundreds of thousands of passengers who fly 20 or more times a year with easyJet are expected to qualify for the club, which has been trialled for 18 months on about 15,000 high-frequency travellers. The airline said 74% of its passengers in 2014 were repeat customers. EasyJet\u2019s chief executive, Carolyn McCall, said the airline had not wanted to imitate a traditional points or air miles scheme as they could \u201cfrustrate\u201d customers. \u201cI am incredibly proud that more than 50 million of our customers flying with us this year have flown with us before and chose to fly with us again,\u201d she said. McCall said it would be \u201ca loyalty scheme with a difference because it gives passengers benefits they really value and can access immediately. It is also simpler to run which means that we can continue to keep our costs low\u201d. She was speaking at an event at easyJet\u2019s Luton airport headquarters to celebrate two decades since the first orange and white plane left Luton for Glasgow on 10 November 1995. The airline\u2019s founder Sir Stelios Haji-Ioannou sat alongside McCall at the event, in a rare cordial public appearance of the airline\u2019s management and its biggest shareholder. Haji-Ioannou had promoted easyJet\u2019s first flight, on a single leased plane, by offering tickets for the price of a pair of Levi\u2019s jeans, then \u00a329.99. On Tuesday McCall said the cheapest fares on the route were \u00a327.49 while the jeans cost \u00a375. The airline flies 68 million passengers to 137 airports in 31 countries and operates 788 routes across Europe. McCall, a former chief executive of Guardian Media Group, said Haji-Ioannou had started the \u201clow-cost flying revolution\u201d and \u201cbroke the fact that flying was reserved for the elite\u201d. Tributes were paid by customers \u2013 including a video message from the British prime minister, David Cameron, who said: \u201cWhen we see that bright orange livery, it means one thing \u2013 time to get away.\u201d McCall said the airline would continue to challenge conventions, and prove that low-cost flying could deliver excellent customer service . She promised that a dedicated Gatwick terminal would improve the flying experience while keeping costs down and revamped websites and apps would simplify booking. In a pointed reference to easyJet\u2019s low-cost rival Ryanair, whose contracted pilots and working practices are being investigated in Germany, McCall said \u201csuccess and size brings responsibility as well as rewards\u201d, adding that easyJet would not \u201conly focus on profit at all cost\u201d. She said easyJet recognised unions and, while employing 10,000 people directly and engaging a further 25,000 as suppliers or contractors across Europe, \u201cwe use local employment rules and practices, unlike any other low-cost airline\u201d. EasyJet has 2,325 customers still in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt, after outbound flights were suspended by the British government amid terror fears after the Metrojet crash. McCall said the airline would be led by the government on any plans to restart flights. \u201cIf any airport needs to tighten its security, it will be government that decides,\u201d she said. McCall denied that easyJet \u201cjumped the gun\u201d in announcing that it would be operating a number of rescue flights out of Sharm el-Sheikh that were later cancelled, adding to confusion as holidaymakers tried unsuccessfully to return home. She said: \u201cWe had clearance and the next day it was rescinded.\u201d She said it was too early to say how much the crisis had cost easyJet in terms of lost bookings and looking after delayed passengers in Egypt, whose accommodation and expenses will be paid by the airline.",

She promised that a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/mar/27/easyjet-seven-year-pricing-deal-gatwick\">dedicated Gatwick terminal</a> would improve the flying experience while keeping costs down and revamped websites and apps would simplify booking. </p> <p>In a pointed reference to easyJet\u2019s low-cost rival Ryanair, whose contracted pilots and working practices are <a href=\"http://www.irishtimes.com/business/transport-and-tourism/german-inquiry-into-ryanair-pilot-work-status-extended-1.2418995\">being investigated in Germany</a>, McCall said \u201csuccess and size brings responsibility as well as rewards\u201d, adding that easyJet would not \u201conly focus on profit at all cost\u201d. </p> <p>She said easyJet recognised unions and, while employing 10,000 people directly and engaging a further 25,000 as suppliers or contractors across Europe, \u201cwe use local employment rules and practices, unlike any other low-cost airline\u201d. </p> <p>EasyJet has 2,325 customers still in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt, after outbound flights were suspended by the British government amid terror fears after the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/oct/31/russian-plane-crashes-in-sinai-egyptian-pm-says\">Metrojet crash</a>. McCall said the airline would be led by the government on any plans to restart flights. \u201cIf any airport needs to tighten its security, it will be government that decides,\u201d she said.</p> <p>McCall denied that easyJet \u201cjumped the gun\u201d in announcing that it would be operating a number of rescue flights out of Sharm el-Sheikh that were later cancelled, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/nov/06/egypt-britons-stranded-sharm-el-sheik-flights-uk\">adding to confusion</a> as holidaymakers tried unsuccessfully to return home. She said: \u201cWe had clearance and the next day it was rescinded.\u201d</p> <p>She said it was too early to say how much the crisis had cost easyJet in terms of lost bookings and <a href=\"http://www.easyjet.com/en/help/sharm-el-sheikh?link=disruptionbanner\">looking after delayed passengers in Egypt</a>, whose accommodation and expenses will be paid by the airline.</p>",

      "bodyText": "China\u2019s growing middle class has helped profits increase for British insurer Prudential, but the company\u2019s strong results were overshadowed by large withdrawals at its UK fund management arm. Prudential has for years focused on selling insurance and savings products to Asia, where sales rose by 20% in the third quarter. The insurer said Hong Kong\u2019s strong performance continued between July and September, and sales were up 73% in the first nine months of the year. More than half of sales in the territory are made to customers from mainland China. The company says its regular premium savings product remains popular with young customers in their 20s and 30s in Hong Kong, who want to save for the future in times of stock market turmoil. On the other hand, luxury goods companies such as Burberry and LVMH have been hit by a slowdown in Chinese spending. Prudential\u2019s chief executive, Mike Wells, who took over from Tidjane Thiam in June, has stuck to his predecessor\u2019s Asian strategy. \u201cYou could be excused for assuming that we might have been hit by the rollercoaster ride we\u2019ve seen in the Chinese equity markets,\u201d he said. But he added that the long-term prospects in China remained good. \u201cIn Asia, we continue to target the huge opportunity offered by the growth of the middle class \u2026 Many people have \u2013 wrongly, in my view \u2013 been looking at the Shanghai Composite Index as the barometer of the health of the Chinese economy. There are better metrics to measure the Chinese economy,\u201d Wells said. He pointed to the expansion of China\u2019s middle class. It has reached 109 million adults this year, outnumbering for the first time the US, with 92 million, according to Credit Suisse\u2019s annual wealth report last month. Despite wild swings in China\u2019s stock markets over the summer, Asia remained Prudential\u2019s main growth engine. Profit from new business rose by 24% to \u00a3976m in the first nine months of the year, with sales up 27% to just over \u00a32bn. The company\u2019s overall new business profit increased by 13% to \u00a31.76bn. Mainland China posted a 4% fall in sales in the third quarter, owing to lower demand for single-premium products amid the stock market turmoil. Regular premium sales, however, were up 23%. Over the first nine months, sales in China rose by 32%. South Korea, the Philippines and Thailand were also strong, offsetting declining sales in Indonesia and Singapore. Prudential\u2019s shares fell nearly 4% on Tuesday to \u00a315. Investors pulled nearly \u00a34bn of funds from its UK asset management arm M&amp;G amid worries about fixed income markets. This was offset partly by new investments, resulting in net fund outflows of \u00a32.7bn. Its US business, Jackson, posted a 4% decline in new business profit to \u00a3557m in the first nine months of the year. In the UK, profit rose by 16% to \u00a3231m, despite a 50% fall in individual annuity sales following pension changes, which also led to more interest in savings products.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Carlsberg has been accused of \u201cgrossly unfair\u201d treatment of its suppliers in Britain by warning it will take more than three months to pay its bills. In the latest example of a big business squeezing its supply chain, the brewer has written to suppliers to extend its payments terms to at least 93 days, in breach of European guidelines. In a letter seen by the Guardian, Carlsberg tells suppliers that it is changing payment terms to \u201cC93\u201d, which means bills will not be paid until 93 days after the end of the month in which the invoice is filed by the supplier. The Forum of Private Business, which represents small businesses in Britain, said the new terms were \u201cgrossly unfair\u201d and urged the government to take action. The FPB has entered Carlsberg, one of the biggest brewers in the world, into its Hall of Shame, which monitors supply chain abuse by big businesses. Carlsberg\u2019s letter is the latest in a string of high-profile companies found to be extending payment terms or retrospectively changing agreements. Other recent examples include drinks group Diageo, Morrisons supermarket, Cadbury\u2019s owner Mondelez, confectioner Mars, and retailers Debenhams and Halfords. The letter, dated 1 July, gave suppliers just two weeks notice of the changes to payment terms. It says: \u201cWe appreciate our business and you as a supplier to Carlsberg. \u201cCarlsberg is adopting new payment terms. The new payment terms relevant are end of month +93 days (so-called C93). \u201cYour current payment terms with us do not match the new payment terms. We kindly ask you to change the payment terms on invoices starting from 1 July 2015 to C93.\u201d The letter is signed by Bengt Erlandsson, the senior vice-president, group procurement, at Carlsberg. In correspondence between Carlsberg and the FPB, also seen by the Guardian, the company claimed it was \u201csurprising\u201d that a supplier had complained about the change of terms. Carlsberg said the changes related to \u201cstrategic suppliers\u201d that operate with the brewer across Europe and it was offering supply chain financing for those that wanted it. Despite European Union guidelines stating that should it take no more than 60 days for businesses to pay bills, Carlsberg said \u201cparties are free under English law to agree payment terms longer than 60 days\u201d. Ian Cass, managing director of the FPB, hit back at Carlsberg\u2019s response and urged the government to take action. He said: \u201cThe letter adds insult to injury. If business is to take the Small Business Commissioner seriously then they will need to respond in a manner that will make them take notice. \u201cThe company\u2019s key suppliers seem to be financial institutions and not the people who help them make and distribute their lager.\u201d Ruth Evans, chief executive of the BFBI trade body for food and drink suppliers, said: \u201cThe increasingly unsustainable payment terms being forced onto the supply chain are creating a situation beyond challenging. \u201cIt is frustrating and disappointing to know that the consumer is protected from unfair practices brought about by the manufacturer but the supplier is not. \u201cThere is a difference between accepting long payment terms and being forced into them in order to be able to tender for business. \u201cThe consequence of increasingly long payment terms - 90 days are common, if not standard in some sectors - is ignored in favour of short term gains \u2013 a short-sighted approach and as far removed from \u2018sustainable\u2019 as the offending \u2018sustainable\u2019 companies can be.\u201d A Carlsberg UK spokesman said: \u201cPayment terms for our suppliers are clear and are agreed as part of ongoing commercial conversations, with smaller suppliers often given beneficial terms.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "New Look plans to open up to 20 menswear stores next year as investment from the South African tycoon Christo Wiese helps the British fashion retailer increase the pace of expansion. The chief executive, Anders Kristiansen, said the company, bought by Wiese\u2019s Brait investment firm in May, would open the stores in major cities including London, Birmingham, Newcastle and Leeds after a successful trial this year. \u201cThe performance has surprised us. In our main stores we always struggle to deliver the same sales per square foot on menswear as on womenswear but the menswear stores have done very well ... We have built credible stores with a real masculine feel \u2013 and men have not seen something like this so are buying more than usual,\u201d he said. The push into menswear comes after a strong half year for the group. Sales at established UK stores, including the website, rose by more than 4.7% in the three months to 26 September, compared with a 4.1% rise in the previous three months. Total sales for the group, which operates 800 stores in 21 countries, rose 5.9% to \u00a3756m and underlying pretax profits rose 40.6% to \u00a339.5m. Growth was helped by a 37.9% rise in sales through New Look\u2019s website and a 47.2% rise via third-party online retailers such as Asos. In contrast with other retailers \u2013 including Marks &amp; Spencer, which blamed weak summer trading on difficult weather conditions \u2013 Kristiansen said New Look had benefited from climatic conditions. \u201cSome of our competitors have been complaining about the weather, but we don\u2019t think it was unfavourable,\u201d he said. \u201cAlthough it is warm now, in September we had an early cold spell and that helped change people\u2019s mindset to buying outerwear and knitwear.\u201d He said that did not happen last year, when retailers were forced to discount heavily to clear stock after an unseasonably warm autumn. Kristiansen said New Look had increased market share as it attempted to improve ranges and lower prices on many items. The chain\u2019s cheapest jumper, for example, is \u00a37.99 compared with \u00a39.99 before. \u201cWe continue to have a very positive outlook in the UK for the next three to five years,\u201d he said. The company is accelerating its expansion in China. It plans to open stores expected by March, taking its total to 85, compared with the 70 planned previously. \u201cWe are a little bit more aggressive than we had been as China continues to work for us,\u201d Kristiansen said. New Look\u2019s fortunes in the country contrast sharply with luxury brands such as Burberry, which has experienced a slowdown in sales as a result of restrictions on shopping in Hong Kong and a crackdown on corporate gifting.",

From Wednesday, the up-market grocer is offering a choice of 14 wines, including a Ch\u00e2teauneuf Du Pape, two Sancerres and a Chablis, under its \u201cpick your own offers\u201d scheme which gives MyWaitrose cardholders 20% off 10 items of their choice. Other Christmas favourites, including stollen, organic mince pies and Schweppes tonic will also be included among 100 seasonal products on the list of 1,000 items which shoppers can choose from over the next few months. The retailer said it would add fresh Christmas food to the scheme, including cheeses, p\u00e2t\u00e9s, hams and seafood, in early December. Waitrose launched its pick your own offers scheme for its 6 million MyWaitrose cardholders in June and since then nearly a million shoppers have signed up. Just over 80% of them regularly use their discounts. Rupert Thomas, marketing director at Waitrose, says: \u201cWe want pick your own offers to be relevant to our customers and so we\u2019re adding the things that people like to stock up on for Christmas, whether that\u2019s essentials or festive treats. \u201d However, Andy Stevens, an analyst at Verdict, said the Waitrose PYO wine discounts looked quite disappointing in comparison to the 25% off when you buy six bottles the retailer is already offering. \u201cAll the supermarkets offer 25% off six bottles of wine at this time of year, it\u2019s become as traditional as anything else at Christmas,\u201d he said. \u201cThis doesn\u2019t set Waitrose apart a huge amount.\u201d Stevens said food retailers were likely to focus on price again this year but it was becoming increasingly difficult to make dramatic moves after 18 months of price cuts. But he said the Waitrose scheme could help encourage visits from shoppers who naturally like to trade up to better quality at Christmas. The retailer said the scheme could add up to \u00a3260m a year or more in costs, although it planned to split that with suppliers who have signed up. Waitrose\u2019s move comes as Asda said it would be offering discounts on food and other items in the run-up to Christmas as it ditches the one-off discount blitz of Black Friday in favour of a series of offers. Marks &amp; Spencer boss Marc Bolland warned that he expected a \u201cspiky\u201d run up to Christmas as Black Friday, on 27 November, puts shoppers in the mood for bargains.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The Serious Fraud Office has dropped fraud charges against Japanese camera-maker Olympus and its UK subsidiary Gyrus Group relating to an accounting scandal four years ago. The move follows an appeal court ruling in February which found that companies cannot be held criminally responsible for misleading their own auditors under English law. The SFO stressed it has been unable to bring prosecutions against individuals in the Olympus case because Japan does not extradite its nationals. The Japanese group and its Gyrus unit were charged by the SFO two years ago in relation to material that had been made available to auditors in 2010 and 2011. The UK charges followed wider revelations of a $1.7bn (\u00a31.1bn) accounting scandal at the Japanese firm, which have since resulted in fines and prosecutions in Tokyo. But on Tuesday a judge at Southwark crown court formally ended proceedings against Olympus and Gyrus after the SFO said it would not offer evidence. With a prosecution of Gyrus effectively blocked, prosecutors are thought to have considered whether to press ahead with charges against parent company Olympus \u2014 something it has now decided against. The failed Olympus case is a blow for the SFO\u2019s director, David Green, who has made clear he wants to hold corporations directly to account for criminal conduct where appropriate. In an interview with the Guardian two years ago, he said: \u201cThe way companies work today, the email chain tends to get rather sparse among very senior managers \u2026 But if a [company] has gained from dishonesty, why should it be able to chuck a few mid-ranking people overboard and sail onwards?\u201d Green has done much to repair the reputation of the SFO since 2012, when he took charge of a then crisis-striken agency, reeling from a costly and error-ridden investigation into property tycoons Vincent and Robert Tchenguiz, both of whom won damages. Since his appointment, Green has secured convictions in relation to high-profile hedge fund and libor-fixing cases, and continues to pursue investigations linked to large companies including Rolls-Royce, ENRC and Barclays. However, prosecutors have also suffered a number of bruising failures. A judge heavily criticised prosecutors last year after the collapse of a bribery case against London businessman Victor Dahdaleh. The SFO was also admonished last year by a second judge over unorthodox efforts to bring a prosecution in relation to businessmen linked to a mining rights controversy in South Wales. The courts threw out the SFO\u2019s case, leaving it facing a \u00a36m bill. The Olympus scandal emerged in 2011 when its then chief executive, Michael Woodford, turned whistleblower over an alleged $1.7bn accounting fraud he said had taken place over 13 years. Woodford said he had discovered it two weeks after taking the top job, and took his findings to the SFO in London. Initially Woodford was ousted as chief executive for questioning Olympus\u2019 past acquisitions, though it later became clear these deals had been used to mask losses. After allegations of hidden losses surfaced, the company\u2019s share price fell 82% in a month. Olympus has since been fined 700m yen (\u00a33.77m) in Japan and three executives pleaded guilty in 2013 to covering up losses at the maker of endoscopes and cameras. Olympus said it had cooperated fully with SFO investigators but \u201cdid not accept that the offences with which they were charged could, as a matter of law, be made out against them\u201d.",

The SFO was also admonished last year by a second judge over unorthodox efforts to bring a prosecution in relation to businessmen linked to a mining rights controversy in South Wales. The courts threw out the SFO\u2019s case, leaving it <a href=\"http://economia.icaew.com/news/february-2015/sfo-faces-6m-legal-bill-over-celtic-energy\">facing a \u00a36m bill</a>. <br></p> <p>The Olympus scandal emerged in 2011 when its then chief executive, Michael Woodford, turned whistleblower over an alleged $1.7bn accounting fraud he said had taken place over 13 years.

      "bodyText": "The Vodafone chief has accused BT of trying to turn Britain\u2019s telecoms sector back into a monopoly by forcing broadband on to its old network and giving consumers speeds that are slower than in southern Europe. Vittorio Colao called for BT\u2019s infrastructure division, Openreach, which operates the cable network, to be spun off into a separate company so UK consumers could get access to modern, fast fibre connections. He said splitting off Openreach would stave off the biggest risk facing the industry in the UK and Europe \u2013 \u201cremonopolisation\u201d \u2013 which could turn back 30 years of increased competition and better service. BT responded that Colao\u2019s comments were \u201chighly misleading\u201d and that the UK was one of the world\u2019s most competitive telecoms markets. Colao has called for tougher regulation of BT after it buys EE from Orange and Deutsche Telekom, which will own about 12% of BT as a result. Colao said the deal would create a dominant operator in the telecoms market that increasingly sold bundled packages of broadband, phone and TV. He told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme: \u201cCompanies like BT and Deutsche Telekom \u2013 and not by coincidence Deutsche Telekom is now the largest shareholder of BT so we have a German BT or a Deutsche BT \u2013 like to use what they have, which is the copper network, modernise it, to reduce competition. Companies like us or Sky or TalkTalk are forced to use them.\u201d He said UK households used the internet a lot but they were doing so on slow lines compared with other countries. \u201cWe are talking 1m megabits per second whereas in southern Europe I\u2019m selling broadband with 100, 200, 300 megabits,\u201d he said. Colao criticised BT as he announced a return to earnings growth for Vodafone in the first half of the year and nudged up its guidance for full-year profits. Core earnings for the six months to the end of September rose 1.9% to \u00a35.8bn, he said. BT\u2019s rivals have called for Ofcom to break up BT to prevent it from controlling Britain\u2019s broadband market. The telecoms regulator is conducting a review of the telecoms industry and BT has pledged to accelerate its rollout of faster fibre connections in an attempt to avoid further criticism. Through Openreach, BT controls the last section of the phone network that goes into a customer\u2019s house. Colao said half of the lines Vodafone took from Openreach were delayed. \u201cBritish consumers experience delays, delays, delays,\u201d he said. BT said: \u201cFibre coverage stands at 90% in the UK compared with just 25% in Italy so we are amazed that Vodafone are suggesting the UK can learn from southern Europe. The UK is a broadband leader and much of that is down to the billions of pounds that BT has invested while other companies have sat on the sidelines with their hands in their pockets.\u201d",

    "sectionName": "Business", 
    "webTitle": "Asda to step away from Black Friday shopping bonanza", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Asda is drastically scaling back its participation in Black Friday after the promotional frenzy caused fights in stores last year. The supermarket chain said customers were fed up with quick sales on pricey, non-essential items such as televisions. Instead of cramming discounts into the US-inspired discount day on 27 November, Asda said it would cut prices by a total of \u00a326m on toys and gifts, food, drink and household items over several weeks in the runup to Christmas. The new tactics mark a dramatic turnaround for the Walmart-owned retailer, which was instrumental in introducing Black Friday to the UK alongside fellow US retailer Amazon. UK retailers are expected to ring up \u00a31.6bn of sales on the day this year, up 20% on last year, according to analysts at Conlumino, who predict more shoppers will participate. The event has changed the shape of Christmas sales for retailers pulling forward sales of big electrical goods and leading shoppers to expect hefty discounts at a time of year when businesses traditionally sell at full price and make a vast proportion of their profits. Now Asda\u2019s bosses say customers want a less fraught shopping experience. Its announcement confirmed the Guardian\u2019s report last week that the retailer intended mainly to bypass Black Friday this year. The chief executive, Andy Clarke, said: \u201cCustomers have told us loud and clear that they don\u2019t want to be held hostage to a day or two of sales. With an ever changing retail landscape, now more than ever we must listen carefully to exactly what our shoppers want and be primed and ready to act the minute their needs change\u201d. He insisted Asda would not lose out by cancelling Black Friday: \u201cWe\u2019re just as confident in our decision to step away from Black Friday as we were in introducing it to the UK.\u201d Analysts said Asda\u2019s decision to tone down Black Friday was likely to have been driven by financial concerns. Last year, Asda attracted negative publicity after camera crews invited to its store in Wembley, north-west London, filmed customers fighting over discounted TVs. Queues of shoppers formed outside the doors and snapped up bargains on toys and electronics but many did not stick around to buy groceries, causing food sales to plunge. The company was also forced to draft in 2,000 extra staff last year, making the business of selling big items at a loss even more expensive. \u201cIf it was driving people into stores they would do it again. Asda must have analysed the numbers and seen it didn\u2019t make any sense. It may have driven a lot of traffic on that day but they have not made any money,\u201d said Bruno Monteyne, a retail analyst at Bernstein Research. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t really boost their food retail credentials and that\u2019s where the real battle is being fought. Last year people didn\u2019t think Asda tomatoes were more juicy because they got a cheap Xbox.\u201d In August, Asda announced its worst sales performance in its 50-year history, amid ferocious competition for customers in which rival supermarkets have slashed prices and issued millions of discount vouchers. Profits have flatlined after it was forced to cut prices and improve the quality of its ranges. Many retailers are unsure how shoppers will react this year. Last year pandemonium at Tesco and Asda stores and overloaded websites on Black Friday were followed by sales slumps that forced some retailers into further discounting before Christmas. Dave Lewis, chief executive of Tesco said: \u201cEveryone would agree there is a need to take the frenzy out of it. We put our colleagues in a difficult position last year.\u201d This year Tesco is drafting extra security guards to avoid the scuffles and disruption that led to police being called to at least 16 stores last year. It will open about 250 of its largest shops at midnight on Black Friday, with a similar range of discounts on electrical, entertainment and mobile products to last year. Home Retail Group, the owner of Argos, warned recently that its profits might take a hit after it spent millions on advertising and brought in extra vans to handle deliveries on the day, but admitted it was unsure about the level of sales that might emerge. Last Friday, Argos launched the first of three discount weekends before Black Friday in an attempt to spread demand over a longer period, but the promotion was hit by website delays. Gordon McKinnon, operations director of Intu, which owns nearly 20 UK shopping centres, said many of its outlets would be opening early and closing late on Black Friday. The Trafford Centre in Manchester will stay open until 11pm; the Metro Centre in Gateshead will open at 7am. He said the company welcomed between a quarter and 30% more people on Black Friday last year than on a typical Friday and was expecting a similar uplift this year. \u201cOur expectation is that it will be a big weekend and a big Friday for sure. The genie on this is out of the bottle and it isn\u2019t going back,\u201d McKinnon said.",

      "bodyText": "Leading shares are slipping back again despite a raft of positive company news. Worries about a slowdown in China, and the knock-on effect for the rest of the global economy, have been reinforced by a new warning from ratings agency Moody\u2019s that problems in emerging markets will hold back world growth. On top of that, investors are increasingly convinced that the US Federal Reserve may raise interest rates in December despite growth fears elsewhere. And there is the added complication of Greece\u2019s latest deadline to meet reforms to release \u20ac2bn of bailout funds, and the rise of anti-austerity factions in Portugal, all of which is adding to the uncertainty. So the FTSE 100 is currently down 15.06 points at 6280.10. Supermarkets have come under pressure following a negative note from Deutsche Bank, with Morrisons down 5.5p at 158.3p, Tesco 5p lower at 173.55p and Sainsbury slipping 2p to 271.3p. Deutsche said there was little reason to expect industry margins to recover materially, although store rents should fall and price cuts will continue, in order to match the discounters. It said: The origin of this report was our ambition to answer three questions; 1) Does Tesco\u2019s scale justify its ambition to recover to an industry leading margin, and what will that industry margin be? 2) Will there be material capacity exit (i.e. store closures), and what does that mean for the sector and stocks? 3) Is price investment the right strategy or, more specifically, are lower gross margins inevitable and permanent? Operating leverage is key to answering these questions. Our conclusions suggest that there is limited upside to sector profitability and that Tesco\u2019s historical margin premium will narrow. We resume coverage of Tesco with a hold recommendation versus a buy previously (target price 210p versus 240p previously). We rate Sainsbury\u2019s hold (target price 265p versus 275p previously). We downgrade Morrisons from hold to sell (target price 155p versus 180p previously). On price it said: Aldi can likely invest another 1% to 1.5% in price and still earn a reasonable return. We\u2019d expect the \u201cBig 4\u201d (Big 3 and Asda) to match any discounter price cuts. Meanwhile Bruno Monteyne at Bernstein commented on the speech by Tesco boss Dave Lewis at the CBI conference on Monday, when he warned of a potential lethal cocktail of higher regulatory costs, including the national living wage and business rates. Monteyne said: Two main topics: Business Rates \u201cunsustainable, needs urgent reform\u201d and increased staff costs: \u201cunintended consequences of living wage have not been though through\u201d. He is calling for more \u201cconsultation, collaboration and co-operation\u201d on these measures. There are three ways of reading this speech: (1) Dave is panicking and blaming the government; (2) Dave is strong and boldly attacking the government or (3-our view) Dave is simply doing his job and using this soapbox to make the case for his industry. As far as the day\u2019s results go, Experian has jumped 71p or more than 6% to \u00a311.75 after the credit specialist reported a better than expected fall in first half profit from $534m to $458m. It also pleased investors by raising its $600m buyout programme by $200m. But it did say it had received a number of class action suits relating to a theft of T-Mobile US customer data at its server. Vodafone has climbed 9.15p to 223.6p as second quarter revenues grew by more than analysts had forecast and the company edged up its guidance for the full year, helped by signs its European markets were stabilising. National Grid is up 18.8p at 914.8p after it said it had put a majority stake in its UK gas distribution up for sale. ITV has added 2.9p to 259.7p after a positive trading update. But mining shares are under pressure again after Chinese inflation rose by less than expected and the Moody\u2019s comments, with Anglo American down 24.6p at 491.4p. Wolseley is leading the FTSE 100 fallers, 186p lower at \u00a336.19 as the building materials group reported a 1.1% fall in UK first quarter revenues and slower growth in the US.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "At dawn on Wednesday an army of 1.7 million foot soldiers and 400,000 vehicles will fan out across towns and cities in China. Its mission? To begin delivering 760m parcels expected to be ordered during a 24-hour orgy of spending that is described as the world\u2019s greatest online shopping fiesta. Singles\u2019 Day \u2013 or Double Eleven, as most Chinese call it in reference to the day on which it falls \u2013 was reputedly started on 11 November 1993 by singleton students who were seeking an excuse to buy themselves presents. Today it is a Chinese institution, creating work for hundreds of thousands of green-uniformed postal workers and vast sums of money for Alibaba, the retail giant credited with turning the day into a commercial phenomenon. When Alibaba decided to launch an annual online sale on Singles\u2019 Day 2009, just 27 merchants took part, slashing their prices for the duration of the 24-hour promotion. Since then the event\u2019s growth, like much in modern China, has been astounding and it now eclipses both the US\u2019s Black Friday and Cyber Monday. Last year 27,000 merchants took part, with Alibaba\u2019s e-commerce sites generating $9.3bn (\u00a36.1bn) in sales. This year, despite concerns over the overall health of the Chinese economy, Singles\u2019 Day is again predicted to hit new heights. Ninety per cent of respondents in a poll carried out by China\u2019s Jinan University and the Information Times newspaper said they would take part by snapping up bargains. Lu Zhenwang, an e-commerce analyst from Shanghai, said he expected a record 100 million people to take part in this year\u2019s online shopping binge, the majority aged between 20 and 40. \u201c[Shoppers come] from all parts of China: every province, every city and even every county town,\u201d he said. Oceanne Zhang, a Shanghai-based e-commerce expert from Kantar Retail, said she expected sales to surge 15% on last year. Part of the reason is that Singles\u2019 Day is now, in fact, no longer held on a single day. Some Chinese e-commerce sites have been offering heavily discounted items for a week now, on the condition that they are paid for on 11 November. Zhang said one day was insufficient time for most people to fulfil their bargain-hunting needs. \u201cIt\u2019s [only] 24 hours. You have to work for eight hours and you have to sleep for six hours. They wanted better [results] this year so they started earlier, will last longer, will have a bigger impact and, of course, will make more transactions happen,\u201d she said. Another factor driving booming sales is the rapid spread of smartphones, of which there are now more than 910m in China. That has allowed the Double Eleven buying phenomenon to spread right across the country, Zhang said. China\u2019s wealthy eastern coast and south have traditionally been the source of most online orders. \u201cBut the key change we have seen this year is that some rural areas are increasing their number of transactions very, very rapidly. Everybody is talking about rural e-commerce.\u201d Alibaba says this year\u2019s Double Eleven shopping spree is also going to be the most international yet. A record number of foreign brands \u2013 including Burberry, Estee Lauder, Nike, Topshop and Uniqlo \u2013 will take part by hawking their wares on Alibaba sites such as Tmall. \u201cEleven/Eleven is going global,\u201d Daniel Zhang, the company\u2019s chief executive, boasted in an interview with Fortune magazine. \u201cChinese consumers will be buying an unprecedented assortment of international brands and products from around the world. Chinese consumers associate quality and prestige with American and European brands, and both have very solid presence on 11/11 in response to strong consumer demand.\u201d Jack Ma, Alibaba\u2019s chairman and founder, said the event was more than \u201cjust the largest shopping day in the world\u201d. He said: \u201cThis festival is a thermometer for the Chinese economy.\u201d Christopher Balding, a professor of finance and economics at Peking University\u2019s HSBC Business School, said observers would look to Singles\u2019 Day results for clues about the state of China\u2019s overall economy. But he cautioned against reading too much into the outcome, particularly since those splashing their cash were likely to represent a younger, single, internet-savvy cross-section of Chinese society. \u201cEverybody is looking for something they can hang their hat on that this is what is going on with the Chinese economy. Whether it is awful or whether it is wonderful, I\u2019m personally a little sceptical that this would be a good benchmark for what is going on in the Chinese economy,\u201d he said. \u201cIf there is negative growth I think that would be a very concerning thing, but even then I wouldn\u2019t read too much into it.\u201d Alibaba appears to be gearing up for a bumper year. The Hangzhou-based company has built an \u201c11/11 command centre\u201d in Beijing and will throw a glitzy gala at the city\u2019s Olympic Water Cube stadium on Tuesday night to kick off proceedings. The US singer Adam Lambert and the Chinese actress Zhao Wei are among those expected to attend the festivities, which will be televised and streamed online. China\u2019s communist founder Mao Zedong might be turning in his mausoleum at the unabashed display of capitalist excess. But Double Eleven celebrations are likely to please the country\u2019s current rulers who are seeking to wean China\u2019s economy off its addiction to state investment and exports, partly by encouraging consumers to spend, spend, spend. China\u2019s latest five-year economic plan, details of which emerged this week, outlines a goal of \u201ca more sustainable and balanced way of development\u201d, with annual growth targets of at least 6.5%. Not everyone is impressed with the furore around Singles\u2019 Day. In an interview with the Qingdao Morning Post, one man lamented how in recent years his wife had frittered away 130,000 yuan (\u00a313,500) of their hard-earned savings on Double Eleven purchases \u2013 thus dashing their dreams of buying a new home. As millions of shoppers prepared to click their way to consumer happiness, the man, named only as Mr Cao, was left with nothing but bitterness and regret. \u201cOur plan didn\u2019t work out because my wife overspent online,\u201d he complained.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The chief executive of National Grid has said he was confident of getting through this winter without blackouts despite Britain\u2019s energy capacity becoming increasingly stretched. Steve Holliday, who is standing down as the pipes and pylons operator\u2019s boss next year, also announced plans to sell a majority stake in the company\u2019s gas distribution business, which is said to be worth about \u00a310bn. National Grid said last month it was more likely to draw on extra sources of power this winter to keep the country\u2019s electricity running and the chance of blackouts was at its highest for a decade. Announcing National Grid\u2019s first-half results, Holliday said: \u201cThis is a tighter winter than last winter but we have got a lot of tools in our kitbag. We are as confident as we have been in the past.\u201d National Grid has faced criticism for allowing spare capacity to fall to 1.2%, down from a peak of 16.8% in 2011-12 and the lowest since 2005-06. The fall follows closures and reduction in output at a number of power stations. The first auction to encourage new capacity to fill the shortfall took place last December. The government expected a number of new gas-fired power stations to be built but most of the new capacity was provided by existing power stations with only 5% coming from a new plant. Holliday said the government may want to offer further incentives to build power stations after next month\u2019s second auction. \u201cWe need to see how this auction goes,\u201d he said. \u201cLast year that only resulted in one new gas fired plant getting a contract. We are about to run that auction again for capacity in 2019 and we will want to reflect on that auction.\u201d National Grid\u2019s pre-tax profit for the six months to the end of September rose 21% to \u00a31.37bn. It increased the interim dividend by 0.29p to 15p. Holliday said the sale of the gas distribution business would leave National Grid with higher growth businesses to fund its dividend and investment though it will keep a \u201csensible\u201d stake, likely to be at least 20%. Potential buyers could include foreign sovereign wealth funds and other infrastructure investors attracted by steady rates of return, he said. Buyers would have to share National Grid\u2019s objectives of safety, reliability and customer service. \u201cIt\u2019s a lower growth business compared with some businesses we own but it has good returns and it generates cash. Many of these infrastructure businesses will be attracted to it,\u201d Holliday said. \u201cToday is literally the start of the process and we expect that process to take right the way through 2016.\u201d Shares in National Grid rose 2.3% to 917p and remain virtually unchanged since the start of this year. Holliday declined to say how much he expected to get for the stake but The Sunday Times has reported the business could be worth as much as \u00a310bn. Holliday will leave National Grid in July after stepping down as chief executive in March.",

The fall follows <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/jan/22/eon-close-power-stations-blackout\">closures and reduction in output</a> at a number of power stations.<br></p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/dec/19/uk-energy-auction-coal-nuclear-generation \">first auction to encourage new capacity</a> to fill the shortfall took place last December. The government expected a number of new gas-fired power stations to be built but most of the new capacity was provided by existing power stations with only 5% coming from a new plant.</p> <p>Holliday said the government may want to offer further incentives to build power stations after next month\u2019s second auction. \u201cWe need to see how this auction goes,\u201d he said. \u201cLast year that only resulted in one new gas fired plant getting a contract. We are about to run that auction again for capacity in 2019 and we will want to reflect on that auction.\u201d</p> <p>National Grid\u2019s pre-tax profit for the six months to the end of September rose 21% to \u00a31.37bn. It increased the interim dividend by 0.29p to 15p.</p> <p>Holliday said the sale of the gas distribution business would leave National Grid with higher growth businesses to fund its dividend and investment though it will keep a \u201csensible\u201d stake, likely to be at least 20%. </p> <p>Potential buyers could include foreign sovereign wealth funds and other infrastructure investors attracted by steady rates of return, he said. Buyers would have to share National Grid\u2019s objectives of safety, reliability and customer service.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a lower growth business compared with some businesses we own but it has good returns and it generates cash. Many of these infrastructure businesses will be attracted to it,\u201d Holliday said. \u201cToday is literally the start of the process and we expect that process to take right the way through 2016.\u201d</p> <p>Shares in National Grid rose 2.3% to 917p and remain virtually unchanged since the start of this year.</p> <p>Holliday declined to say how much he expected to get for the stake but The Sunday Times has reported <a href=\"http://www.thesundaytimes.co.uk/sto/business/Industry/article1629982.ece\">the business could be worth as much as \u00a310bn</a>. Holliday will leave National Grid in July after stepping down as chief executive in March.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Construction work in central London is at its highest level since the financial crisis as the technology industry drives an economic boom in the city. New office buildings in the centre of the capital are going up at a rate 18% higher than six months ago, according to a report by Deloitte Real Estate. There are now 77 office schemes under construction covering 11.1m sq ft the most since 2008. A collection of new City skyscrapers are among those keeping construction companies busy. These include 100 Bishopsgate, which will house the Royal Bank of Canada, while Principal Place is to be the new UK base for Amazon. The surge in developments will add to fears that the London economy is becoming further detached from the rest of the country, but the increase is in part because projects were scrapped or put on hold after the financial crisis owing to funding problems. Some are now being revived, such as 100 Bishopsgate, where plans have been in place for years, while the shelving of projects has also led to a shortfall of new office space in the West End and City. There has also been a 24% rise in the number of sites being demolished and prepared for construction in the last six months. Steve Johns, head of City leasing at Deloitte Real Estate, said: \u201cCranes will be dominating London\u2019s skyline for the foreseeable future as construction activity keeps pace with healthy occupier demand.\u201d Many of the new developments already have anchor tenants, although 21 of the 26 new projects started in the last six months are speculative. Johns said: \u201c4.3m sq ft of the 11.1m sq ft under construction has already been let, up 22% from our last survey. Looking ahead, developers\u2019 sentiment remains high, as 21 of the new starts totalling 2.6m sq ft are speculative developments.\u201d The rapid growth of the technology industry is fuelling developments in London. Of the leasing deals already agreed, 44% are with technology, media and telecoms companies, while just 27% are with financial services groups, the traditional occupiers of space in central London. Construction in the City has risen by a quarter in the last six months, while the West End enjoyed a 5% increase.",

    "webTitle": "American Apparel: Paula Schneider's 'wild ride' to revive the brand", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Dov Charney, the founder of American Apparel, was sacked from his role as CEO nearly a year ago, but he is still a looming presence at the fashion brand. Only last week he spent a few hours walking back and forth outside the company\u2019s Los Angeles offices alongside factory workers protesting over pay. The controversial fashion executive, who was ousted after a string of lawsuits alleging sexual misconduct, has been replaced by Paula Schneider, a former executive at the US label BCBG and the lingerie group Warnaco. She is trying to resuscitate the brand after nearly six years of falling profits. Many hoped her arrival in January would mark a turning point for the troubled company known for its hot pants, $30 (\u00a320) T-shirts and high-waist jeans. Ten months in, however, she has been forced to put American Apparel into Chapter 11 bankruptcy and seen factory workers batter a pinata effigy of her in their protest over pay. There have been dozens of legal actions, some of which stemmed from Charney\u2019s time at the helm. Over the past 18 months, the company has spent more than $40m on lawyers\u2019 fees and a nother $6m on settlements with former staff and other litigators. \u201cIt\u2019s been a wild ride,\u201d she admits, dressed head to toe in black as she works the micro-wardrobe that enables her to pack carry-on for a business trip to London and the Middle East. \u201cI didn\u2019t expect it to be so contentious. It\u2019s just a clothing company,\u201d she says. She says that certain members of the former management continue to stir up difficulties to fuel their agenda of \u201cfinding a way back into the company at all costs \u2013 at any cost\u201d. \u201cI don\u2019t think [Charney] will ever give up, but it doesn\u2019t matter as there are new owners of the company,\u201d she says. Charney, who founded the brand from his Tufts University dormitory room in 1989, lost his $8.2m stake when the company announced it was delisting last month and filed for bankruptcy with debts of more than $200m. The process, which should be completed early next year, will see bonds exchanged for equity in the company, reducing its debt to no more than $135m and cutting annual interest payments by $20m. The debt restructuring is a key part of Schneider\u2019s turnaround plan, which relies on reducing central costs while trying to reboot a brand that has become synonymous more with sleaze than sex appeal. It\u2019s a tricky game. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to build the plane while flying the plane,\u201d she said. Once one of the hottest brands on the planet, American Apparel appears to have lost its mojo. Sales dived 17% in the three months to 30 June, the last reported period. When it launched in the late 1980s, newspapers wrote approvingly about its ethical stance. All its goods were made in the US where workers were paid and treated well. More recently, however, it has made headlines over Charney\u2019s exploits, which have included turning up to work in his underpants and masturbating in front of a female journalist, and its adverts, which have frequently featured scantily clad young women in suggestive poses. Schneider says the brand will now talk more about US manufacturing and its campaigning work on immigration and gay rights. Sex will not, however, disappear. \u201cAs a woman and a feminist, I want to celebrate women and ensure whatever we are doing doesn\u2019t denigrate women, but I still think women are sexy and we are still a sexy brand,\u201d she says. Only 10% of the brand\u2019s ads, such as a \u201cback to school\u201d shot of a young girl bending over a car to show her underwear, stepped over the line, she claims, adding that such ads will not be appearing again. She says the sales problems are down to organisational and financial issues that prevented the company\u2019s newest and most exciting products from reaching stores. This season, it only had enough money to deliver 10% of its autumn/winter range and that was after using every scrap of fabric in its warehouse. \u201cOur customer wants new, and when we introduce new products into stores we win. It\u2019s less of a brand problem than an execution problem,\u201d she says. \u201cLooking forward, we have a beautiful spring range and the liquidity to put that into work. We\u2019re hoping that things will start on a better track going from spring into fall next year.\u201d Whether in forecasting and managing stock, making sure that advertised products are featured in stores or regulating sizes properly so customers know what fits, Schneider says a lot can be done to fix the basics. Perhaps her most contentious move has been her cost-cutting strategy, which has reduced overtime hours at the factory and in stores. About 135 jobs have been cut in manufacturing and at head office in the past year. She says that the company had a $14m overtime bill in 2014 and was losing money for the fifth year in a row. It has now changed staff contracts in stores and used planning tools to cut back on overtime. She insists that factory workers\u2019 average hours have dropped just one hour to 40 hours, despite all the problems at the company. \u201cWe have to manage things for the good of the whole company, for everyone\u2019s benefit. There\u2019s an overall understanding of that throughout the business,\u201d she says. Despite all the brickbats, she is motivated by keeping American Apparel\u2019s 9,000 workers in their jobs. \u201cThis leadership team is not the group who brought Amercian Apparel into bankruptcy. It is the group that is taking it out \u2026 Few brands have this cachet. American Apparel isn\u2019t going anywhere. It\u2019s going everywhere,\u201d she says.

      "bodyText": "Up the stone steps. Through the heavy doors. Into an ornate lobby to be greeted by a security man wearing a pink frock coat and a top hat. These are a visitor\u2019s first impressions of the Bank of England. The man in the fancy clothes, Reg Shaw, has worked there for 27 years. His coat is cleaned once a month. His top hat is custom-made by Patey of Mayfair, which has been making hats since 1695 \u2013 the year after the Bank of England opened its doors for the first time. All this sends a clear message: this place is old, this place is serious, this place has its own way of doing things. Like a medieval monastery, it is walled-off and self-contained. Behind this imposing facade, which occupies a three-acre site on Threadneedle Street, is one of the most powerful institutions in Britain. Upon entering, it feels a little like a mausoleum. The ceilings are high and there are mosaics on the floor. People speak quietly and walk with a measured tread. The corridors and stairwells form an intricate maze, in which staff sometimes get lost. It is not hard to see why some of the 2,200 people who work here fondly refer to it as Hogwarts. Take one of the lifts below ground and the atmosphere is different, more like a nuclear bunker: the endless identical corridors, thick security doors, and the rumbling of passing tube trains make it faintly claustrophobic. This is where the gold is kept \u2013 all 400,000 bars of it, each weighing 13kg and worth \u00a3300,000 apiece. (The Bank is careful about who it lets down to the vaults, so it has its own full-time locksmith, known affectionately as Bob the Lock.) In the wake of the worst financial and economic crisis to befall the UK in a century, the Bank of England has acquired more power than it has ever had in its 321-year history. Before 2008, it was responsible for setting interest rates, keeping gold in its vaults, and deciding what our physical currency looked like. However, in the past seven years, it has undergone a radical transformation. These days, it can affect the terms on which a household can obtain a mortgage, it is responsible for overseeing individual insurance companies and ensuring that the big banks do not go bust again. These new responsibilities were granted by the chancellor, George Osborne, who, in July 2013, appointed a new governor, Mark Carney, to sweep the City clean. The Treasury had to pay around \u00a3900,000 a year to woo Carney away from the Bank of Canada to take up the most powerful non-elected job that the UK has to offer. The chancellor\u2019s remit for Carney was simple: make sure there is not a repetition of the near-meltdown of 2008 and address the public perception that the financial sector has become a cesspit of venality and corruption. It is a big task for the Bank, which is now heavily exposed should things go wrong. It could make a hash of setting interest rates. It could let another bubble inflate in the housing market. It could miss the next crisis in the financial markets by looking in the wrong place for the source of the problem. There are already some warning signs. The Bank has been havering over the timing of its first interest-rate rise in eight years, the Swiss bank UBS has described the London housing market as an accident waiting to happen, and the Bank itself has acknowledged that half the business that goes on in the City is opaque and needs closer monitoring. While the Bank had long been known for its secrecy, Carney\u2019s tenure has been marked by a more open approach. In the past two and a half years, there have been more on-the-record interviews with the governor than there were with his two predecessors, Eddie George and Mervyn King, in two decades. Carney is keen to show that the modern Bank of England is more than a bunch of economists sitting above a bullion vault. The Bank has even given the public a say in the choice of which visual artist should be the face on the new \u00a320 note, to enter circulation in 2020. Back in 2013, it responded to a public campaign to put Jane Austen on the next \u00a310 note. This time it has run a formal consultation, during which 29,701 nominations were made for 590 eligible artists. The fact that the Bank is now more powerful has not gone unnoticed or uncriticised. It too has been caught up in the scandals that have ripped apart the City\u2019s reputation \u2013 the rigging of the currency markets and interest rates \u2013 and it too needs to win the trust of the public. With the scars of one crisis still livid and the outlines of the next dimly visible, the Bank is keen to explain what it does and why it does it. Its reputation \u2013 and the fate of the British economy \u2013 is on the line if things go wrong. * * * There is a paradox about the way the Bank of England acquired its new responsibilities. It was the result of two colossal failures, both of which the Bank was heavily involved in. Each time, it avoided most of the blame. And each time, when politicians looked for ways to repair the damage, they decided to hand more power to Threadneedle Street. The first occasion, 16 September 1992, became known as Black Wednesday. Two years earlier, Britain had joined the European exchange rate mechanism (ERM) \u2013 the forerunner to European monetary union \u2013 in the hope that pegging the pound to the German mark would be a way to keep inflation low. But in the weeks prior to Black Wednesday, pressure had been mounting on the pound. On 16 September, the crisis came to a head when the Bank was forced into emergency action to defend sterling against speculative attack. The Bank sold Britain\u2019s foreign exchange reserves to protect sterling, but was cleaned out in a morning of frenetic trading. As a result, the UK was forced to leave the ERM because the cost of defending sterling would have deepened an already painful recession. Black Wednesday was a humiliation for the Bank of England. It left the Treasury and the Bank with no option but to build an entirely new framework for controlling inflation. They did so by setting an official inflation target, through monthly meetings between the chancellor of the exchequer and the governor of the Bank of England to discuss interest rates, and in the publication of a quarterly assessment of the state of the economy, from the Bank. Until 1997, the chancellor still had the final say when it came to deciding the cost of borrowing, but in one of its first moves after sweeping to victory in the May election, Tony Blair\u2019s Labour government handed operational independence to the Bank of England\u2019s newly created monetary policy committee (MPC). The idea was that the politicians would set a target for inflation, and the technocrats at the Bank would move interest rates up and down to hit it. The MPC has nine members, five work for the Bank full-time \u2013 including the governor himself \u2013 and four are independent, appointed by the chancellor. Along with granting the Bank the right to set interest rates, the new Labour government made another momentous decision. It stripped the Bank of its prized powers of banking supervision, which were handed to the new Financial Services Authority. For a time, this seemed relatively unimportant, since the first decade after independence was marked by steady growth, low inflation and an absence of nasty financial shocks. Mervyn King, governor from 2003 to 2013, called it the \u201cNice\u201d decade \u2013 a period of non-inflationary continual expansion. The first signs that the Nice decade was at an end came in the summer of 2007, when the City and Wall Street began to realise that all was not well with the US housing market. But it took another year for the crisis to develop into the near-meltdown of the global financial system that led to the Bank of England getting back the banking supervision powers it had lost in 1997 \u2013 plus some extra responsibilities. The turning point was the collapse of the American investment bank Lehman Brothers on 15 September 2008. Although Lehman was small by Wall Street standards, its bankruptcy led to immediate panic, as investors fretted about which bank would be next to fail. In the UK, the two most vulnerable institutions were seen as Royal Bank of Scotland and HBOS. Less than a month after the failure of Lehman, the Treasury stepped in with \u00a365bn to bail them both out. The affair highlighted weaknesses in the British regulatory system, which was seen in retrospect as too fragile and too fragmented. Reports into the debacle questioned whether the Bank could have acted more efficiently. However, Ben Broadbent, the Bank\u2019s deputy governor for monetary policy, who was working for Goldman Sachs at the time of the crisis, says the Bank was operating \u201con the hoof\u201d and did the best it could. After becoming chancellor in 2010, George Osborne concluded that reform was needed. First, he set up a new body inside the Bank of England: the financial policy committee (FPC), which would monitor developments in banks, hedge funds, and markets. The new FPC has powers to intervene directly in the mortgage market in order to prevent bubbles from developing. Second, Osborne scrapped the Financial Services Authority that had been given responsibility for policing the City. He created the Financial Conduct Authority, which is not part of the Bank of England, to regulate the way financial firms and their employees behave. At the same time, he reversed Labour\u2019s decision to take banking regulation away from Threadneedle Street and set up the Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA), which was charged with making sure that banks are financially sound and competently run. The PRA has the power to hold bankers to account in a way that they have not been before. It can interview board directors of banks and insurance companies in a more forensic fashion than in the past and can even force companies to change their business plans if it considers them too reckless. The broad message of Osborne\u2019s reforms was clear: be careful, the Bank of England is watching you \u2013 the days of light-touch regulation are over. * * * The Bank knows it is under scrutiny as never before. In June, Carney used his annual address at the Mansion House to announce the Bank\u2019s first \u201copen forum\u201d, which will take place tomorrow. The idea behind the forum is to bring together experts and the public to discuss the future of financial markets. Carney has lined up some high-profile guests, including George Osborne and Mario Draghi, president of the European Central Bank. Half the 400 places have been allocated to the public through an open ballot, although attendees will get no closer to the Bank than Guildhall, a medieval building 400m down the road, where the all-day sessions will take place. Within the walls of the Bank itself, it will be business as usual. Among its many roles, the Bank is a cash depository. Below ground, chief cashier Victoria Cleland oversees dozens of strong rooms with crates full of notes stashed for emergencies, such as a run on the banks. The crates are kept in wire cages stacked from floor to ceiling in long aisles. Also kept in the vaults are 40 supersized notes, known as titans, each worth \u00a3100m, which exist to underwrite the value of notes issued by the Banks of Northern Ireland and Scotland. Visitors to Cleland\u2019s underground hideout are stripped of their wallets before they enter, and in these hallways, the sour smell of printer\u2019s ink on paper is unmistakable and strong. Above ground, there is a bank within the Bank. Some 4,500 current and former staff have accounts at the Bank of England, which come with the distinctive sort code 10 00 00. (However, a consultation is now under way to examine cost and practicality, which could herald the end of the accounts.) The bank within the Bank is also a place where the public can exchange old notes that are out of circulation for new ones. Sarah de Bunsen, head of the public cash desk, says that once someone came in with a wheelie suitcase packed with \u00a3400,000 of notes that were no longer legal tender, and wanted the cash back. \u201cWe weren\u2019t geared up for an exchange of that size,\u201d says de Bunsen. \u201cWe had to go the vaults and get it. It took three days to do two counts.\u201d Mutilated notes \u2013 brought in or posted \u2013 are sent off to the Bank\u2019s Leeds office for security checks. \u201cYou would be amazed at what people do with their notes,\u201d de Bunsen says. \u201cThey bury them in the garden. They keep them in the microwave, they put them in the loft and forget about them.\u201d This is one of the reasons why her colleague, Cleland is pushing to replace the paper bank note with a smoother, cleaner polymer variety, which will be more resilient and harder to fake. This is all part of Cleland\u2019s job, which, in her words, exists \u201cto maintain public confidence in the physical currency, to make sure we have enough notes of the right denomination of the right quality, to give the public confidence they are genuine and not counterfeit\u201d. When Cleland gives talks in schools, children call her \u201cthe money lady\u201d because it is her signature that appears on banknotes. For the past few years, though, the really serious money that the Bank of England has dealt with has not been the stuff stashed below ground, but that which it has created itself through its quantitative easing programme. The cash vaults contain hundreds of millions of pounds and the gold is valued at around \u00a3120bn, but that is almost nothing compared to \u00a3375bn the Bank pumped into the economy to prevent the most serious recession in 100 years turning into a second Great Depression. The banking, payments and financial resilience division helped make this quantitative easing programme become a reality. Headed by Andrew Hauser from a modern office overlooking the old banking hall, the department oversees the electronic system that makes payments for home-buyers, banks and governments. In just three days the entire value of the UK\u2019s GDP moves around the financial system. \u201cThis is the engine room of the decisions that are made everywhere else,\u201d says Hauser. At the centre of the Bank\u2019s daily operations, of course, is Mark Carney himself. Most days, Carney holds a morning meeting with his four deputies to discuss what has been going right and, more importantly, what has the potential to go wrong. They assemble at 8.30am in his cavernous office, a routine Carney established when he became governor. Last month, sitting at the neat, uncluttered table where he holds his meetings, Carney admitted that being new to the Bank is to his advantage. \u201cThings had been difficult during the crisis, the Bank had responded well, given its limited powers and handcuffs and shackles. As I showed up [the Bank] got new powers, a new organisation, doubled in size and tripled in powers. There was a natural management challenge of how do we make it work. I benefited from the ignorance.\u201d One of Carney\u2019s aims has been to make the place less stuffy and hierarchical. Authors of papers, even junior officials, are now encouraged to attend the meetings where their ideas are discussed, rather than having them presented by their superiors. Staff admit that this \u201cauthor in the room\u201d concept is slowly gaining acceptance. Other small changes include an instruction that staff are allowed to call Carney by his first name. In the past, the preferred form of address was \u201cMr Governor\u201d. But Carney\u2019s informality should not be overestimated: like his predecessors, he is not a man to suffer fools gladly. He has an easy charm, but his tongue can have a sharp edge. He wasted no time in creating his own team at the top of the Bank, bringing in Charlotte Hogg from the private sector in the newly created role of chief operating officer and moving staff to new roles. Andrew Haldane, one of the Bank\u2019s high-fliers, became chief economist, a position he has used to express views that do not always accord with the governor\u2019s. Carney guards his private life as carefully as the Bank guards its gold. He will happily talk about the Bank\u2019s guidance on interest rates or whether high-street banks are too big to fail \u2013 often in long, complicated sentences \u2013 but can be terse when asked about himself. When pushed, he will talk about his support for Everton (he has cousins in Liverpool), how he likes the Great British Bake Off (he wanted Tamal to win), how he likes indie music (as a Canadian, he is partial to Arcade Fire), and how he sometimes runs into work from his north London home. The governor completed the London marathon this year in a little more than three and a half hours \u2013 about the time it took the speculators to take the Bank to the cleaners on Black Wednesday. * * * There are four main criticisms of the Bank: that it is old fashioned and stuffy, that it loses all its best people to the City, that too much power is vested in the office of the governor, and that it is delving into political matters that threaten its independence. Charlotte Hogg\u2019s appointment as chief operating officer was designed to address the first point. A bigger bank with more powers cannot be left to run itself, so she has been hired as full-time manager. Carney wants Threadneedle Street to operate as a single institution rather than divisions that never speak to each other, and it is Hogg\u2019s task to implement this \u201cOne Bank\u201d vision. She is also keen to promote diversity: the preponderance of white men walking the corridors of power has not been good for the Bank\u2019s image. In addition to appointing women, such as Cleland and deputy governor for financial markets Minouche Shafik, to the top jobs, the Bank now offers university scholarships and placements to people of African-Caribbean backgrounds. The Bank has also signed up to OUTstanding, the professional network for LGBT executives. Employees are members of Unite and the Bank pays the London living wage to all its staff, including contract cleaners and caterers. Staff say it has a family feel. Security guard Reg Shaw\u2019s daughter works on the reception desk. Javi Onder, an 18-year-old school-leaver with a role in IT, is in her first few months at the Bank where her mother, in the markets and payments division, has worked for 20 years. Given the enormous salaries on offer elsewhere in the City, the Bank is naturally concerned about the second charge \u2013 that it loses too much of its top talent, but Gareth Ramsay, head of the monetary analysis division, says the idea of a brain drain to the City is not correct. He sees the first five years as a key cut-off point for the postgraduate economists the Bank hires. \u201cAfter about five years they are properly trained, they know about how to do analysis quickly. At that point there is a career choice and investment banks start to try and cherry pick them,\u201d Ramsay says. However, Hogg points out that the attrition rate is low \u2013 annual staff turnover is 8.3%. The third criticism \u2013 that the role of governor has grown too powerful \u2013 was brought up at a recent meeting of the Treasury select committee, the powerful body of MPs that holds the Bank to account. At the meeting, Steve Baker, Conservative MP for High Wycombe, focused on the power vested in the governor. Baker noted that in committee meetings, Carney tended to dominate the conversation, at the expense of the independent members of the MPC. \u201cAre you satisfied,\u201d Baker asked Carney, \u201cthat you receive adequate, robust challenge so that we can feel confident that the whole institutions [the key committees that Carney chairs] are not exclusively dependent on your own thought?\u201d In response, Carney cited Bank Underground \u2013 a blog where Bank of England staff can air their views in public \u2013 as one of the ways free thought is encouraged. If MPs directed questions at the governor rather than his colleagues, he said, that was their problem not his. The explanation failed to convince the chair of the committee, Conservative MP Andrew Tyrie. \u201cThe risk in any institution with a powerful figure chairing all the Bank\u2019s key policy committees is that you end up with groupthink. Groupthink is a considerable risk in any organisation at the best of times. I can\u2019t think of a financial crisis that has not had groupthink as a major contributory cause,\u201d says Tyrie. It\u2019s a point that hits home. In the run-up to the financial crisis, the Bank was so concerned with keeping inflation low that it failed to spot the bubble in the housing market. Nor is this simply a reputational issue. The Serious Fraud Office is looking into the way the Bank provided emergency funding for the markets during the crisis in 2007 and 2008. Having granted the Bank independence in 1997, Labour is now reconsidering its powers. Jeremy Corbyn, the party\u2019s leader, has tasked former MPC member, David \u201cDanny\u201d Blanchflower to look at whether inflation should be the sole focus of interest-rate decisions. Blanchflower, who is not one of Carney\u2019s biggest fans, believes that the Bank should be like the US Federal Reserve and add growth and employment to its remit. This leads to the fourth area of concern: that the extra responsibilities could become too much of a burden. David Marsh, who runs the independent thinktank, the Official Monetary and Financial Institutions Forum, talks about the \u201cmyth\u201d of central bank independence. The more powers the bank receives, the more likely it is to upset politicians, who will then be tempted to take the powers back again. Tyrie makes a similar point: \u201cHaving been given all these powers, the Bank is now grasping that if it strays too far from what might be acceptable to the government, it could be uncomfortable. The government is discovering that this very high level of Bank independence means it can\u2019t always get done some of the things it feels are essential.\u201d Hanging on the wall of the office of Ramsay \u2013 the official responsible for helping the MPC decide whether to raise interest rates \u2013 is the cartoon, drawn in 1797 by Gillray, that gave the Bank its nickname. The image depicts the Old Lady of Threadneedle Street being ravished by William Pitt the Younger. Gillray\u2019s message was that the Bank \u2013 then a private company \u2013 was turned into a political institution by providing the money to allow the government of the day to fight another war with France. Ramsay explains why he sits beneath it: \u201cThat challenge of keeping our independence and keeping our neutrality, but maintaining accountability that goes with that, runs through everything here.\u201d * * * Over the past 40 years, there has, on average, been a recession or crisis once every seven or eight years. It has been six years since the British economy was last in recession, so one is due around now. Concerns have been raised about the overheated London housing market. There have been warnings from the Bank for International Settlements, the body that represents central banks, that global debt levels are getting too high. Another concern is that, under pressure from the City, the government is watering down some of the new rules intended to constrain banking excess. So Carney, his governors and top officials, have been travelling the length of the country to show their faces outside the City of London, and listening to ideas. Members of the MPC go on regular regional visits to take the temperature of the economy. In mid-October, Carney\u2019s deputy, Ben Broadbent, who is responsible for monetary policy, went by train to Ipswich to meet one of the Bank\u2019s 12 agents, who provide economic intelligence. Phil Eckersley, the local agent, had arranged a meeting with three executives from the estate agency Fenn Wright at the Ipswich and Suffolk private members club. Broadbent wanted to know what was happening locally to commercial property (not much) and buy-to-let (growing strongly). He asked whether people were ready for interest rates to rise, although he was at pains to say that they are not about to. The Bank has kept interest rates at 0.5% since March 2009, lower than they have been in its history. If it raises rates too sharply, the MPC could push the economy into deflation. If it waits too long, inflation will pick up. Broadbent started his life in the Treasury in the late 1980s and on the train journey to Suffolk he recounted his debut in the annual cricket match between the Treasury and the Bank of England. \u201cFirst ball was a bouncer aimed at my head from Haldane A.\u201d Andrew Haldane is the one member of the Bank\u2019s MPC who thinks the next move in interest rates might be down rather than up. In the same week that Broadbent was testing the mood in East Anglia, Andrew Bailey, the deputy governor responsible for regulating the banks, went to the Mansion House to address the annual City Banquet, a black-tie gathering of the financial industry\u2019s senior figures. After guests were summoned to dinner by the banging of a gong and the slow handclap that traditionally greets the top table at these formal dinners, Bailey took his seat beside John McFarlane, the chairman of Barclays. A former chief cashier of the Bank \u2013 the vaults are stacked with notes bearing his signature \u2013 Bailey is head of the Prudential Regulation Authority, the body at the forefront of the attempts to prevent another taxpayer bailout of the financial system. The banks are pushing back against new rules. Next month, after conducting what have now become annual health checks on the biggest lenders, the PRA will decide whether the banking system is strong enough to withstand a global financial crisis. The onus is on the Bank to make the system safe. That evening, in his speech, Bailey wanted to make clear that the new rules being put in place to try to prevent another crisis are not being watered down. The speech was finely tuned for those assembled on the long, white-clothed tables. It covered the ways senior executives will be held to account, the amount of capital banks must hold, and it addressed a lingering worry about new rules coming into force in 2019 that require banks to protect their high-street customers from troublesome investment banks. \u201cIf you think we have watered down the regime, please let me know,\u201d Bailey said. Carney is aware there will be no hiding place if things go wrong. \u201cWe are much more fit for purpose than we used to be,\u201d he says. \u201cWe can\u2019t have the defence that we didn\u2019t have enough powers or that we weren\u2019t responsible for this issue, which was the case in 2008.\u201d The broader powers mean that Carney is also straying into new areas for a governor of the Bank of England. His views on global warming have enraged critics who feel he is overstepping the bounds of his mandate. (In September, he warned insurers in a speech at Lloyd\u2019s of London that \u201cthe challenges currently posed by climate change pale in significance compared with what might come\u201d.) More recently, Carney\u2019s views on the EU have also whipped his opponents into a frenzy. In late October, Carney returned to Oxford, where he obtained his doctorate in economics, to deliver his first major speech about how EU membership affects the Bank of England. As he walked on stage at the Sheldonian theatre \u2013 which was completed in 1669, 25 years before the Bank was founded \u2013 Carney was greeted with thunderous applause. The audience comprised a mixture of students, suited alumni and lecturers wearing jeans. His delivery was fluent, and the event was streamed live on the Bank\u2019s website. Carney said membership of the EU had been good for Britain, but that it had left the UK more exposed to the recent debt crisis in the eurozone. In future, EU rules would have to be flexible enough to cope with countries, such as Britain, that were not part of the single currency. While Carney was still on his feet, the speech was already making headlines along the lines of \u201cCarney says EU is good for Britain\u201d. Deep underground in Threadneedle Street\u2019s briefing room, Sir Jon Cunliffe, another deputy, had spent 90 minutes before the governor started speaking, explaining the Bank\u2019s position to economic journalists. In response, Conservative chancellors past and present leapt up to have their say. Nigel Lawson, who ran the Treasury in the 1980s, said on the BBC: \u201cI can\u2019t think of any previous governor who would wade in a political way on an issue such as this.\u201d George Osborne, whose views on this subject chime with those of the governor, told the House of Commons Treasury committee that Carney\u2019s speech was a \u201cwelcome addition to the debate\u201d. At the Sheldonian, Carney had been careful to argue that whether Britain is in the EU or not has implications for interest rates and for the safety of the country\u2019s banks, for which the Bank is responsible. He spelt out that he was not making a comprehensive assessment of the pros and cons of the United Kingdom being in Europe \u2013 but he knew the backlash was coming. His mission is summed up by a Latin inscription at the entrance to the Bank\u2019s parlours: \u201cSic vos non vobis\u201d (Thus we labour for others not ourselves). His critics would say that another piece of Latin would be appropriate in view of the Bank\u2019s new powers: Quis custodiet ipsos custodes \u2013 Who guards the guards themselves? \u2022 Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, or sign up to the long read weekly email here.",

These are a visitor\u2019s first impressions of the Bank of England. The man in the fancy clothes, Reg Shaw, has worked there for 27 years. His coat is cleaned once a month. His top hat is custom-made by Patey of Mayfair, which has been making hats since 1695 \u2013 the year after the Bank of England opened its doors for the first time. All this sends a clear message: this place is old, this place is serious, this place has its own way of doing things. Like a medieval monastery, it is walled-off and self-contained. Behind this imposing facade, which occupies a three-acre site on Threadneedle Street, is one of the most powerful institutions in Britain.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2015/nov/23/economy-bankofenglandgovernor\">Inside the Bank of England - Podcast</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Upon entering, it feels a little like a mausoleum. The ceilings are high and there are mosaics on the floor. People speak quietly and walk with a measured tread. The corridors and stairwells form an intricate maze, in which staff sometimes get lost. It is not hard to see why some of the 2,200 people who work here fondly refer to it as Hogwarts.</p> <p>Take one of the lifts below ground and the atmosphere is different, more like a nuclear bunker: the endless identical corridors, thick security doors, and the rumbling of passing tube trains make it faintly claustrophobic. This is where the gold is kept \u2013 all 400,000 bars of it, each weighing 13kg and worth \u00a3300,000 apiece. (The Bank is careful about who it lets down to the vaults, so it has its own full-time locksmith, known affectionately as Bob the Lock.)</p> <p>In the wake of the worst financial and economic crisis to befall the UK in a century, the Bank of England has acquired more power than it has ever had in its 321-year history. Before 2008, it was responsible for setting interest rates, keeping gold in its vaults, and deciding what our physical currency looked like. However, in the past seven years, it has undergone a radical transformation. These days, it can affect the terms on which a household can obtain a mortgage, it is responsible for overseeing individual insurance companies and ensuring that the big banks do not go bust again.</p> <p>These new responsibilities were granted by the chancellor, George Osborne, who, in July 2013, appointed a new governor, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/nov/29/mark-carney-bank-of-england-interview\">Mark Carney</a>, to sweep the City clean. The Treasury had to pay around \u00a3900,000 a year to woo Carney away from the Bank of Canada to take up the most powerful non-elected job that the UK has to offer. The chancellor\u2019s remit for Carney was simple: make sure there is not a repetition of the near-meltdown of 2008 and address the public perception that the financial sector has become a cesspit of venality and corruption.</p> <p>It is a big task for the Bank, which is now heavily exposed should things go wrong. It could make a hash of setting interest rates. It could let another bubble inflate in the housing market. It could miss the next crisis in the financial markets by looking in the wrong place for the source of the problem.</p> <p>There are already some warning signs. The Bank has been havering over the timing of its first interest-rate rise in eight years, the Swiss bank UBS has described the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/2015/oct/29/london-house-prices-most-overvalued-world-ubs\">London housing market</a> as an accident waiting to happen, and the Bank itself has acknowledged that half the business that goes on in the City is opaque and needs closer monitoring.</p> <p>While the Bank had long been known for its secrecy, Carney\u2019s tenure has been marked by a more open approach. In the past two and a half years, there have been more on-the-record interviews with the governor than there were with his two predecessors, Eddie George and Mervyn King, in two decades. Carney is keen to show that the modern Bank of England is more than a bunch of economists sitting above a bullion vault. The Bank has even given the public a say in the choice of which visual artist should be the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/may/19/visual-artist-to-grace-new-20-note-experts-suggest-blake-or-turner\">face on the new \u00a320 note</a>, to enter circulation in 2020. Back in 2013, it responded to a public campaign to put Jane Austen on the next \u00a310 note. This time it has run a formal consultation, during which 29,701 nominations were made for 590 eligible artists.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The new governor is keen to show that the modern Bank is more than a bunch of economists sitting above a bullion vault</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The fact that the Bank is now more powerful has not gone unnoticed or uncriticised. It too has been caught up in the scandals that have ripped apart the City\u2019s reputation \u2013 the rigging of the currency markets and interest rates \u2013 and it too needs to win the trust of the public. With the scars of one crisis still livid and the outlines of the next dimly visible, the Bank is keen to explain what it does and why it does it. Its reputation \u2013 and the fate of the British economy \u2013 is on the line if things go wrong.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p><strong>There is a paradox about the way</strong> the Bank of England acquired its new responsibilities. It was the result of two colossal failures, both of which the Bank was heavily involved in. Each time, it avoided most of the blame. And each time, when politicians looked for ways to repair the damage, they decided to hand more power to Threadneedle Street.</p> <p>The first occasion, 16 September 1992, became known as <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/sep/13/black-wednesday-20-years-pound-erm\">Black Wednesday</a>. Two years earlier, Britain had joined the European exchange rate mechanism (ERM) \u2013 the forerunner to European monetary union \u2013 in the hope that pegging the pound to the German mark would be a way to keep inflation low. But in the weeks prior to Black Wednesday, pressure had been mounting on the pound. On 16 September, the crisis came to a head when the Bank was forced into emergency action to defend sterling against speculative attack. The Bank sold Britain\u2019s foreign exchange reserves to protect sterling, but was cleaned out in a morning of frenetic trading. As a result, the UK was forced to leave the ERM because the cost of defending sterling would have deepened an already painful recession.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"b70d4bd3f11abb544756171e4db7aad8275978e0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b70d4bd3f11abb544756171e4db7aad8275978e0/0_0_5760_3840/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Bank of England is wall-off and self-contained from the surrounding City of London.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Bank of England is wall-off and self-contained from the surrounding City of London.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Levene for the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Black Wednesday was a humiliation for the Bank of England. It left the Treasury and the Bank with no option but to build an entirely new framework for controlling inflation. They did so by setting an official inflation target, through monthly meetings between the chancellor of the exchequer and the governor of the Bank of England to discuss interest rates, and in the publication of a quarterly assessment of the state of the economy, from the Bank.</p> <p>Until 1997, the chancellor still had the final say when it came to deciding the cost of borrowing, but in one of its first moves after sweeping to victory in the May election, Tony Blair\u2019s Labour government <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/1997/may/07/economy.uk\">handed operational independence to the Bank of England\u2019s newly created monetary policy committee</a> (MPC). The idea was that the politicians would set a target for inflation, and the technocrats at the Bank would move interest rates up and down to hit it. The MPC has nine members, five work for the Bank full-time \u2013 including the governor himself \u2013 and four are independent, appointed by the chancellor.</p> <p>Along with granting the Bank the right to set interest rates, the new Labour government made another momentous decision. It stripped the Bank of its prized powers of banking supervision, which were handed to the new <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/financial-services-authority-fsa\">Financial Services Authority</a>. For a time, this seemed relatively unimportant, since the first decade after independence was marked by steady growth, low inflation and an absence of nasty financial shocks. Mervyn King, governor from 2003 to 2013, called it the \u201cNice\u201d decade \u2013 a period of non-inflationary continual expansion.</p> <p>The first signs that the Nice decade was at an end came in the summer of 2007, when the City and Wall Street began to realise that all was not well with the US housing market. But it took another year for the crisis to develop into the near-meltdown of the global financial system that led to the Bank of England getting back the banking supervision powers it had lost in 1997 \u2013 plus some extra responsibilities.</p> <p>The turning point was the collapse of the American investment bank <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/sep/15/lehmanbrothers.creditcrunch\">Lehman Brothers</a> on 15 September 2008. Although Lehman was small by Wall Street standards, its bankruptcy led to immediate panic, as investors fretted about which bank would be next to fail. In the UK, the two most vulnerable institutions were seen as Royal Bank of Scotland and HBOS. Less than a month after the failure of Lehman, the Treasury stepped in with \u00a365bn to bail them both out.</p> <p>The affair highlighted weaknesses in the British regulatory system, which was seen in retrospect as too fragile and too fragmented. Reports into the debacle questioned whether the Bank could have acted more efficiently. However, Ben Broadbent, the Bank\u2019s deputy governor for monetary policy, who was working for Goldman Sachs at the time of the crisis, says the Bank was operating \u201con the hoof\u201d and did the best it could.</p> <p>After becoming chancellor in 2010, George Osborne concluded that reform was needed. First, he set up a new body inside the Bank of England: the financial policy committee (FPC), which would monitor developments in banks, hedge funds, and markets. The new FPC has powers to intervene directly in the mortgage market in order to prevent bubbles from developing.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"9764ff0ac6442ae4d2f396abfb70e5e55cca83ca\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9764ff0ac6442ae4d2f396abfb70e5e55cca83ca/0_0_5760_3840/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The keys in the office of the Bank\u2019s own locksmith, who is known as Bob the Lock.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The keys in the office of the Bank\u2019s own locksmith, who is known as Bob the Lock.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Levene for the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Second, Osborne scrapped the Financial Services Authority that had been given responsibility for policing the City. He created the Financial Conduct Authority, which is not part of the Bank of England, to regulate the way financial firms and their employees behave. At the same time, he reversed Labour\u2019s decision to take banking regulation away from Threadneedle Street and set up the Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA), which was charged with making sure that banks are financially sound and competently run. The PRA has the power to hold bankers to account in a way that they have not been before. It can interview board directors of banks and insurance companies in a more forensic fashion than in the past and can even force companies to change their business plans if it considers them too reckless.</p> <p>The broad message of Osborne\u2019s reforms was clear: be careful, the Bank of England is watching you \u2013 the days of light-touch regulation are over.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p><strong>The Bank knows it is under scrutiny</strong> as never before. In June, Carney used his annual address at the Mansion House to announce the Bank\u2019s first \u201copen forum\u201d, which will take place tomorrow. The idea behind the forum is to bring together experts and the public to discuss the future of financial markets. Carney has lined up some high-profile guests, including George Osborne and<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/mario-draghi\"> Mario Draghi</a>, president of the European Central Bank.</p> <p>Half the 400 places have been allocated to the public through an open ballot, although attendees will get no closer to the Bank than Guildhall, a medieval building 400m down the road, where the all-day sessions will take place. Within the walls of the Bank itself, it will be business as usual.</p> <p>Among its many roles, the Bank is a cash depository. Below ground, chief cashier <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/2012/apr/13/working-life-head-of-notes-bank-of-england\">Victoria Cleland</a> oversees dozens of strong rooms with crates full of notes stashed for emergencies, such as a run on the banks. The crates are kept in wire cages stacked from floor to ceiling in long aisles. Also kept in the vaults are 40 supersized notes, known as titans, each worth \u00a3100m, which exist to underwrite the value of notes issued by the Banks of Northern Ireland and Scotland. Visitors to Cleland\u2019s underground hideout are stripped of their wallets before they enter, and in these hallways, the sour smell of printer\u2019s ink on paper is unmistakable and strong.</p> <p>Above ground, there is a bank within the Bank. Some 4,500 current and former staff have accounts at the Bank of England, which come with the distinctive sort code 10 00 00. (However, a consultation is now under way to examine cost and practicality, which could herald the end of the accounts.) The bank within the Bank is also a place where the public can exchange old notes that are out of circulation for new ones. Sarah de Bunsen, head of the public cash desk, says that once someone came in with a wheelie suitcase packed with \u00a3400,000 of notes that were no longer legal tender, and wanted the cash back. \u201cWe weren\u2019t geared up for an exchange of that size,\u201d says de Bunsen. \u201cWe had to go the vaults and get it. It took three days to do two counts.\u201d</p> <p>Mutilated notes \u2013 brought in or posted \u2013 are sent off to the Bank\u2019s Leeds office for security checks. \u201cYou would be amazed at what people do with their notes,\u201d de Bunsen says. \u201cThey bury them in the garden. They keep them in the microwave, they put them in the loft and forget about them.\u201d This is one of the reasons why her colleague, Cleland is pushing to replace the paper bank note with a smoother, cleaner polymer variety, which will be more resilient and harder to fake.</p> <p>This is all part of Cleland\u2019s job, which, in her words, exists \u201cto maintain public confidence in the physical currency, to make sure we have enough notes of the right denomination of the right quality, to give the public confidence they are genuine and not counterfeit\u201d. When Cleland gives talks in schools, children call her \u201cthe money lady\u201d because it is her signature that appears on banknotes.</p> <p>For the past few years, though, the really serious money that the Bank of England has dealt with has not been the stuff stashed below ground, but that which it has created itself through its <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/jan/22/what-is-quantitative-easing\">quantitative easing</a> programme. The cash vaults contain hundreds of millions of pounds and the gold is valued at around \u00a3120bn, but that is almost nothing compared to \u00a3375bn the Bank pumped into the economy to prevent the most serious recession in 100 years turning into a second Great Depression.<strong> </strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"a8d8560929327852fef5730e2298ae1b9a9f654a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a8d8560929327852fef5730e2298ae1b9a9f654a/0_0_5624_3813/1000.jpg\" alt=\"People speak quietly and walk with a measured tread around the Bank.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"678\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">People speak quietly and walk with a measured tread around the Bank.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Levene for the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The banking, payments and financial resilience division helped make this quantitative easing programme become a reality. Headed by Andrew Hauser from a modern office overlooking the old banking hall, the department oversees the electronic system that makes payments for home-buyers, banks and governments.<strong> </strong> In just three days the entire value of the UK\u2019s GDP moves around the financial system. \u201cThis is the engine room of the decisions that are made everywhere else,\u201d says Hauser.</p> <p>At the centre of the Bank\u2019s daily operations, of course, is Mark Carney himself. Most days, Carney holds a morning meeting with his four deputies to discuss what has been going right and, more importantly, what has the potential to go wrong. They assemble at 8.30am in his cavernous office, a routine Carney established when he became governor.</p> <p>Last month, sitting at the neat, uncluttered table where he holds his meetings, Carney admitted<strong> </strong>that being new to the Bank is to his advantage. \u201cThings had been difficult during the crisis, the Bank had responded well, given its limited powers and handcuffs and shackles. As I showed up [the Bank] got new powers, a new organisation, doubled in size and tripled in powers. There was a natural management challenge of how do we make it work. I benefited from the ignorance.\u201d</p> <p>One of Carney\u2019s aims has been to make the place less stuffy and hierarchical. Authors of papers, even junior officials, are now encouraged to attend the meetings where their ideas are discussed, rather than having them presented by their superiors. Staff admit that this \u201cauthor in the room\u201d concept is slowly gaining acceptance. Other small changes include an instruction that staff are allowed to call Carney by his first name. In the past, the preferred form of address was \u201cMr Governor\u201d.</p> <p>But Carney\u2019s informality should not be overestimated: like his predecessors, he is not a man to suffer fools gladly. He has an easy charm, but his tongue can have a sharp edge. He wasted no time in creating his own team at the top of the Bank, bringing in Charlotte Hogg from the private sector in the newly created role of chief operating officer and moving staff to new roles. Andrew Haldane, one of the Bank\u2019s high-fliers, became chief economist, a position he has used to express views that do not always accord with the governor\u2019s.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"b6d46f5007d05716e1f8d27b4a4458860d881d8f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b6d46f5007d05716e1f8d27b4a4458860d881d8f/832_49_2343_2464/951.jpg\" alt=\"Mark Carney, the governor of the Bank of England, poses with his medal after running the London Marathon\" width=\"951\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mark Carney, the governor of the Bank of England, poses with his medal after running the London Marathon</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Suzanne Plunkett/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Carney guards his private life as carefully as the Bank guards its gold. He will happily talk about the Bank\u2019s guidance on interest rates or whether high-street banks are too big to fail \u2013 often in long, complicated sentences \u2013 but can be terse when asked about himself. When pushed, he will talk about his support for Everton (he has cousins in Liverpool), how he likes the Great British Bake Off (he wanted Tamal to win), how he likes indie music (as a Canadian, he is partial to Arcade Fire), and how he sometimes runs into work from his north London home. The governor completed the London marathon this year in a little more than three and a half hours \u2013 about the time it took the speculators to take the Bank to the cleaners on Black Wednesday.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p><strong>There are four main criticisms of the Bank:</strong> that it is old fashioned and stuffy, that it loses all its best people to the City, that too much power is vested in the office of the governor, and that it is delving into political matters that threaten its independence.</p> <p>Charlotte Hogg\u2019s appointment as chief operating officer was designed to address the first point. A bigger bank with more powers cannot be left to run itself, so she has been hired as full-time manager. Carney wants Threadneedle Street to operate as a single institution rather than divisions that never speak to each other, and it is Hogg\u2019s task to implement this \u201cOne Bank\u201d vision. She is also keen to promote diversity: the preponderance of white men walking the corridors of power has not been good for the Bank\u2019s image. In addition to appointing women, such as Cleland and deputy governor for financial markets Minouche Shafik, to the top jobs, the Bank now offers university scholarships and placements to people of African-Caribbean backgrounds. The Bank has also signed up to <a href=\"https://www.out-standing.org/\">OUTstanding</a>, the professional network for LGBT executives.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"a00d52ed9d4d82e98dbc1a4f0c7b8324b4ca54cb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a00d52ed9d4d82e98dbc1a4f0c7b8324b4ca54cb/0_60_4799_2880/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Charlotte Hogg is the Bank\u2019s chief operating officer.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Charlotte Hogg is the Bank\u2019s chief operating officer.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Levene for the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Employees are members of Unite and the Bank pays the London living wage to all its staff, including contract cleaners and caterers. Staff say it has a family feel. Security guard Reg Shaw\u2019s daughter works on the reception desk. Javi Onder, an 18-year-old school-leaver with a role in IT, is in her first few months at the Bank where her mother, in the markets and payments division, has worked for 20 years.</p> <p>Given the enormous salaries on offer elsewhere in the City, the Bank is naturally concerned about the second charge \u2013 that it loses too much of its top talent, but Gareth Ramsay, head of the monetary analysis division, says the idea of a brain drain to the City is not correct. He sees the first five years as a key cut-off point for the postgraduate economists the Bank hires. \u201cAfter about five years they are properly trained, they know about how to do analysis quickly. At that point there is a career choice and investment banks start to try and cherry pick them,\u201d Ramsay says. However, Hogg points out that the attrition rate is low \u2013 annual staff turnover is 8.3%.</p> <p>The third criticism \u2013 that the role of governor has grown too powerful \u2013 was brought up at a recent meeting of the Treasury select committee, the powerful body of MPs that holds the Bank to account. At the meeting, Steve Baker, Conservative MP for High Wycombe, focused on the power vested in the governor. Baker noted that in committee meetings, Carney tended to dominate the conversation, at the expense of the independent members of the MPC. \u201cAre you satisfied,\u201d Baker asked Carney, \u201cthat you receive adequate, robust challenge so that we can feel confident that the whole institutions [the key committees that Carney chairs] are not exclusively dependent on your own thought?\u201d</p> <p>In response, Carney cited <a href=\"http://bankunderground.co.uk/\">Bank Underground</a> \u2013 a blog where Bank of England staff can air their views in public \u2013 as one of the ways free thought is encouraged. If MPs directed questions at the governor rather than his colleagues, he said, that was their problem not his.</p> <p>The explanation failed to convince the chair of the committee, Conservative MP Andrew Tyrie. \u201cThe risk in any institution with a powerful figure chairing all the Bank\u2019s key policy committees is that you end up with groupthink. Groupthink is a considerable risk in any organisation at the best of times. I can\u2019t think of a financial crisis that has not had groupthink as a major contributory cause,\u201d says Tyrie.</p> <p>It\u2019s a point that hits home. In the run-up to the financial crisis, the Bank was so concerned with keeping inflation low that it failed to spot the bubble in the housing market. Nor is this simply a reputational issue. The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/mar/04/sfo-launches-investigation-into-bank-of-england-liqudity-auctions\">Serious Fraud Office is looking into</a> the way the Bank provided emergency funding for the markets during the crisis in 2007 and 2008.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The Bank failed to spot the bubble in the housing market or do enough to rein in the excesses of the City</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Having granted the Bank independence in 1997, Labour is now reconsidering its powers. Jeremy Corbyn, the party\u2019s leader, has tasked former MPC member, David \u201cDanny\u201d Blanchflower to look at whether inflation should be the sole focus of interest-rate decisions. Blanchflower, who is not one of Carney\u2019s biggest fans, believes that the Bank should be like the US Federal Reserve and add growth and employment to its remit.</p> <p>This leads to the fourth area of concern: that the extra responsibilities could become too much of a burden. David Marsh, who runs the independent thinktank, the <a href=\"http://www.omfif.org/\">Official Monetary and Financial Institutions Forum</a>, talks about the \u201cmyth\u201d of central bank independence. The more powers the bank receives, the more likely it is to upset politicians, who will then be tempted to take the powers back again.</p> <p>Tyrie makes a similar point: \u201cHaving been given all these powers, the Bank is now grasping that if it strays too far from what might be acceptable to the government, it could be uncomfortable. The government is discovering that this very high level of Bank independence means it can\u2019t always get done some of the things it feels are essential.\u201d</p> <p>Hanging on the wall of the office of Ramsay \u2013 the official responsible for helping the MPC decide whether to raise interest rates \u2013 is the cartoon, drawn in 1797 by Gillray, that gave the Bank its nickname. The image depicts the Old Lady of Threadneedle Street being ravished by William Pitt the Younger. Gillray\u2019s message was that the Bank \u2013 then a private company \u2013 was turned into a political institution by providing the money to allow the government of the day to fight another war with France. Ramsay explains why he sits beneath it: \u201cThat challenge of keeping our independence and keeping our neutrality, but maintaining accountability that goes with that, runs through everything here.\u201d</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p><strong>Over the past 40 years,</strong> there has, on average, been a recession or crisis once every seven or eight years. It has been six years since the British economy was last in recession, so one is due around now. Concerns have been raised about the overheated London housing market. There have been warnings from the Bank for International Settlements, the body that represents central banks, that global debt levels are getting too high. Another concern is that, under pressure from the City, the government is watering down some of the new rules intended to constrain banking excess. So Carney, his governors and top officials, have been travelling the length of the country to show their faces outside the City of London, and listening to ideas.</p> <p>Members of the MPC go on regular regional visits to take the temperature of the economy. In mid-October, Carney\u2019s deputy, Ben Broadbent, who is responsible for monetary policy, went by train to Ipswich to meet one of the Bank\u2019s 12 agents, who provide economic intelligence. Phil Eckersley, the local agent, had arranged a meeting with three executives from the estate agency Fenn Wright at the Ipswich and Suffolk private members club. Broadbent wanted to know what was happening locally to commercial property (not much) and buy-to-let (growing strongly). He asked whether people were ready for interest rates to rise, although he was at pains to say that they are not about to. The Bank has kept interest rates at 0.5% since March 2009, lower than they have been in its history. If it raises rates too sharply, the MPC could push the economy into deflation. If it waits too long, inflation will pick up.</p> <p>Broadbent started his life in the Treasury in the late 1980s and on the train journey to Suffolk he recounted his debut in the annual cricket match between the Treasury and the Bank of England. \u201cFirst ball was a bouncer aimed at my head from Haldane A.\u201d Andrew Haldane is the one member of the Bank\u2019s MPC who thinks the next move in interest rates might be down rather than up.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"f69153df7e99c99304be2beaba25427dcd162a94\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f69153df7e99c99304be2beaba25427dcd162a94/0_0_5760_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Victoria Cleland, the chief cashier, in one of the many Bank of England vaults.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Victoria Cleland, the chief cashier, in one of the many Bank of England vaults. Each crate of cash holds about \u00a34m.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Levene for the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In the same week that Broadbent was testing the mood in East Anglia, Andrew Bailey, the deputy governor responsible for regulating the banks, went to the Mansion House to address the annual City Banquet, a black-tie gathering of the financial industry\u2019s senior figures. After guests were summoned to dinner by the banging of a gong and the slow handclap that traditionally greets the top table at these formal dinners, Bailey took his seat beside John McFarlane, the chairman of Barclays.</p> <p>A former chief cashier of the Bank \u2013 the vaults are stacked with notes bearing his signature \u2013 Bailey is head of the Prudential Regulation Authority, the body at the forefront of the attempts to prevent another taxpayer bailout of the financial system. The banks are pushing back against new rules. Next month, after conducting what have now become annual health checks on the biggest lenders, the PRA will decide whether the banking system is strong enough to withstand a global financial crisis. The onus is on the Bank to make the system safe.</p> <p>That evening, in his speech, Bailey wanted to make clear that the new rules being put in place to try to prevent another crisis are not being watered down. The speech was finely tuned for those assembled on the long, white-clothed tables. It covered the ways senior executives will be held to account, the amount of capital banks must hold, and it addressed a lingering worry about new rules coming into force in 2019 that require banks to protect their high-street customers from troublesome investment banks. \u201cIf you think we have watered down the regime, please let me know,\u201d Bailey said.</p> <p>Carney is aware there will be no hiding place if things go wrong. \u201cWe are much more fit for purpose than we used to be,\u201d he says. \u201cWe can\u2019t have the defence that we didn\u2019t have enough powers or that we weren\u2019t responsible for this issue, which was the case in 2008.\u201d</p> <p>The broader powers mean that Carney is also straying into new areas for a governor of the Bank of England. His views on global warming have enraged critics who feel he is overstepping the bounds of his mandate. (In September, he warned insurers in a speech at Lloyd\u2019s of London that \u201cthe challenges currently posed by climate change pale in significance compared with what might come\u201d.) More recently, Carney\u2019s views on the EU have also whipped his opponents into a frenzy.</p> <p>In late October, Carney returned to Oxford, where he obtained his doctorate in economics, to deliver his first major speech about how EU membership affects the Bank of England. As he walked on stage at the Sheldonian theatre \u2013 which was completed in 1669, 25 years before the Bank was founded \u2013 Carney was greeted with thunderous applause. The audience comprised a mixture of students, suited alumni and lecturers wearing jeans. His delivery was fluent, and the event was streamed live on the Bank\u2019s website. Carney said membership of the EU had been good for Britain, but that it had left the UK more exposed to the recent debt crisis in the eurozone. In future, EU rules would have to be flexible enough to cope with countries, such as Britain, that were not part of the single currency.</p> <p>While Carney was still on his feet, the speech was already making headlines along the lines of \u201cCarney says EU is good for Britain\u201d. Deep underground in Threadneedle Street\u2019s briefing room, Sir Jon Cunliffe, another deputy, had spent 90 minutes before the governor started speaking, explaining the Bank\u2019s position to economic journalists.</p> <p>In response, Conservative chancellors past and present leapt up to have their say. Nigel Lawson, who ran the Treasury in the 1980s, said on the BBC: \u201cI can\u2019t think of any previous governor who would wade in a political way on an issue such as this.\u201d George Osborne, whose views on this subject chime with those of the governor, told the House of Commons Treasury committee that Carney\u2019s speech was a \u201cwelcome addition to the debate\u201d.</p> <p>At the Sheldonian, Carney had been careful to argue that whether Britain is in the EU or not has implications for interest rates and for the safety of the country\u2019s banks, for which the Bank is responsible. He spelt out that he was not making a comprehensive assessment of the pros and cons of the United Kingdom being in Europe \u2013 but he knew the backlash was coming. His mission is summed up by a Latin inscription at the entrance to the Bank\u2019s parlours: \u201c<em>Sic vos non vobis</em>\u201d (Thus we labour for others not ourselves). His critics would say that another piece of Latin would be appropriate in view of the Bank\u2019s new powers: <em>Quis custodiet ipsos custodes</em> \u2013 Who guards the guards themselves?</p> <p>\u2022 Follow the Long Read on Twitter at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/@gdnlongread\">@gdnlongread</a>, or sign up to the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/news/2015/jul/20/sign-up-to-the-long-read-email\">long read weekly email</a> here.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Stock markets in Asia Pacific have continued to slide as the spectre of higher borrowing costs in the United States and further signs of weakness in China prompted investors to trim their exposure to riskier assets. The recent rally that followed the market selloff in July and August has petered out as poor Chinese inflation figures on Tuesday pointed to persistent weak demand in the world\u2019s second biggest economy. Consumer prices in China rose just 1.3% in the year to October, data released by the National Bureau of Statistics showed \u2013 the lowest since May and down sharply from 1.6% in September. It was also well below market expectations of 1.5%. The broad MSCI index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan fell on Tuesday, with stocks down in Shanghai by 0.42% and South Korea\u2019s Kospi dropping 1.5%. In Australia the ASX/S&amp;P200 was having another tough day and was down more than 1% at 2.30pm as investors dumped financial stocks. Shares rallied later in the afternoon to close at 5,099 points, a fall of 0.4%. In Japan, the Nikkei fell 0.6% from Monday\u2019s 10-week high in early trading before moving into positive territory later in the day. \u201cAfter share prices recovered quite a lot (last month), their rally is coming to a halt for now as markets are trying to price in a Fed rate hike in December,\u201d said Takeru Ogihara, chief strategist at Mizuho Trust Securities in Tokyo. The OECD said in a report that global trade flows have fallen dangerously close to levels usually associated with a global recession, although steps taken by China and others should ensure a pick-up in 2016. On the other hand, surprisingly strong US jobs data released on Friday has dramatically changed investors\u2019 perception on the Federal Reserve\u2019s monetary policy track, with markets pricing in more than a 70% chance of a rate hike next month. The stronger US dollar piled more pressure on commodity prices on Tuesday. Copper fell to a six-week low of $4,940 per tonne, hit also by concerns about demand from China. Brent crude traded at $47.32 a barrel, having slipped more than 7% from last week\u2019s high. The slump in prices is contributing to China\u2019s deflationary pressure and comes amid growing doubts in global markets about China\u2019s commitment to see through comprehensive financial reforms and prepare the country consumer-led economic growth. However, on Tuesday the country\u2019s central bank chief mapped out a series of reforms over the next five years to help the yuan become an international currency by 2020. The policy changes would include improving central bank communications and guiding market expectations to enhance monetary policy, Zhou Xiaochuan wrote on the Caixin magazine\u2019s website. Beijing would also strengthen supervision of its financial system to prevent \u201csystemic risk\u201d.",

      "bodyText": "When the text of the Trans-Pacific Partnership was finally released last Friday morning, many supporters and detractors went straight to one of its most controversial provisions: so-called investor state dispute settlement (ISDS). This provision, opposed by Labor and the Greens in Australia, gives foreign investors the power to sue the Australian government for introducing legislation that harms their investment. Andrew Robb, the Australian trade minister, was quick to defend the agreement from its detractors. He lauded Australia\u2019s efforts to secure significant exemptions, which he said would make it impossible for foreign corporations to sue the Australian government for enacting environmental policy. \u201cIt\u2019s a trade agreement which looks at issues relating to trade that can affect public policy in the environmental area \u2026 It does provide safeguards, the best safeguards that have ever been provided in any agreement in this regard.\u201d Robb said critics were just the usual suspects \u201cjumping at shadows\u201d, \u201cpeddling lines they\u2019ve been peddling for years without having a decent look at what\u2019s been negotiated\u201d. But George Kahale III is not one of the usual suspects. As chairman of the world\u2019s leading legal arbitration firm \u2013 Curtis, Mallet-Prevost, Colt &amp; Mosle LLP \u2013 his core business is to defend governments being sued by foreign investors under ISDS. Some of his clients are included in the TPP, and he says the trade minister\u2019s critics are right: \u201cThere are significant improvements in this treaty, but they do not immunise Australia from any of these claims. If the trade minister is saying, \u2018We\u2019re not at risk for regulating environmental matters\u2019, then the trade minister is wrong.\u201d Speaking via Skype from his office in New York, Kahale thumbs through the investment chapter, pointing out the critical loopholes that leave Australia wide open. \u201cThe one where all the discussion should be focused is 9.15,\u201d he says, referring to one of the \u201csafeguards\u201d. \u201cThat\u2019s a very nice provision, which I imagine the trade minister points to as, \u2018We\u2019ve really protected ourselves on anything of social importance.\u2019 I think that\u2019s nonsense, frankly.\u201d Here\u2019s what 9.15 says: \u201cNothing in this chapter shall be construed to prevent a party from adopting, maintaining or enforcing any measure otherwise consistent with this chapter that it considers appropriate to ensure that investment activity in its territory is undertaken in a manner sensitive to environmental, health or other regulatory objectives.\u201d This entire provision is negated, says Kahale, by five words in the middle: \u201cunless otherwise consistent with this chapter\u201d. \u201cSo at the end of the day, this provision, which really held out a lot of promise of being very protective, is actually much ado about nothing.\u201d Kahale says many provisions in the TPP investment chapter are a vast improvement on previous trade deals. But he says all this hard work could be for nothing because of another provision. \u201cWhy would you spend so much time and effort doing a great job in negotiating narrow provisions to this treaty, when you have a \u2018most favoured nation\u2019 clause?\u201d This is where things get a little technical. Essentially, an MFN clause is tantamount to a classic wipeout move. It would enable foreign corporations from TPP states to make a claim against Australia based on the ISDS provisions in any other trade deal Australia has signed, no matter which country it was signed with. That means it does not matter how carefully the TPP is drafted: foreign investors can cherrypick another treaty Australia has signed, and sue the Australian government based on the provisions included in that treaty. Kahale has described MFN as \u201ca dangerous provision to be avoided by treaty drafters whenever possible\u201d because it can turn one bad treaty into protections \u201cnever imagined for virtually an entire world of investors\u201d. Including an MFN clause in the TPP was a \u201cmajor mistake\u201d, Kahale argues, and another reason Australia is still wide open to being sued for legislating to protect the environment. If you are curious about what this might look like, take Germany, for example. The German government has had two claims brought against it by the same corporation, Vattenfall, a Swedish energy company. First, Vattenfall sued the government for \u20ac1.4bn over the Hamburg provincial government\u2019s decision to place extra environmental restrictions on a coal-fired power plant the company was planning to build along the river Elbe. To settle this case, Germany had to remove the restrictions. In 2012, Vattenfall announced it was suing the German government again, this time over its decision to phase out nuclear power after the Fukushima nuclear disaster. This was in breach of its contract to allow the company to build and operate nuclear power plants, claimed Vattenfall, which has lodged another claim against Germany, reported to be worth \u20ac4bn. Billion-dollar claims are becoming the norm, says Kahale, citing a recent case in Ecuador, where the government now owes more than $1bn to the multinational oil company Occidental. \u201cThat is a huge number for Ecuador! From my reading of the facts, and my reading of the decision, terrible mistakes were made. The decision was 2-1 to begin with, with a very strong dissent. Now you can be sure, if they\u2019d had a different panel of arbitrators, that could just as easily have been 2-1 the other way.\u201d The problem with ISDS is not just that corporations can sue governments, says Kahale, but that its entire legal framework is fundamentally flawed. ISDS claims are not heard in a standing court staffed by independent judges. Instead, claims can proceed in ad hoc courtrooms \u2013 a hotel room, for example \u2013 by three arbitrators hand-picked by the parties. Unlike a traditional court of law, these arbitrators are not obliged to refer to precedent and, since their decisions are not open to appeal, they are free to rule according to their personal opinion. The arbitrators can also be severely conflicted, says Kahale, because they may act as a judge one day and as a lawyer for a party the next. Kahale\u2019s criticisms have been echoed by Robert French, the chief justice of Australia\u2019s high court. In a speech last July, he said: \u201cArbitral tribunals set up under ISDS provisions are not courts, nor are they required to act like courts, yet their decisions may include awards which significantly impact on national economies and on regulatory systems within nation states.\u201d Kahale believes the ISDS system is so badly flawed it should be abolished, and started again from scratch. Australia, he warns, should think very carefully before signing up to it in the TPP. \u201cWhat I would say to Australians is that while the system is in the state it\u2019s in right now, signing any new treaty is a very serious mistake. You have to weigh the benefits against the burdens. Somebody at some point might be able to explain to me where all the benefits are, but I certainly haven\u2019t seen any.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>When the text of the Trans-Pacific Partnership was finally released last Friday morning, many supporters and detractors went straight to one of its most controversial provisions: so-called investor state dispute settlement (ISDS). This provision, opposed by Labor and the Greens in Australia, gives foreign investors the power to sue the Australian government for introducing legislation that harms their investment.</p> <p>Andrew Robb, the Australian trade minister, was quick to defend the agreement from its detractors. He lauded Australia\u2019s efforts to secure significant exemptions, which he said would make it impossible for foreign corporations to sue the Australian government for enacting environmental policy. \u201cIt\u2019s a trade agreement which looks at issues relating to trade that can affect public policy in the environmental area \u2026 It does provide safeguards, the best safeguards that have ever been provided in any agreement in this regard.\u201d <br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/nov/06/andrew-robb-defends-tpp-after-full-release-of-trade-deal-document\">Andrew Robb defends TPP after full release of trade deal document</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Robb said critics were just the usual suspects \u201cjumping at shadows\u201d, \u201cpeddling lines they\u2019ve been peddling for years without having a decent look at what\u2019s been negotiated\u201d.</p> <p>But George Kahale III is not one of the usual suspects. As chairman of the world\u2019s leading legal arbitration firm \u2013 Curtis, Mallet-Prevost, Colt &amp; Mosle LLP \u2013 his core business is to defend governments being sued by foreign investors under ISDS. Some of his clients are included in the TPP, and he says the trade minister\u2019s critics are right: \u201cThere are significant improvements in this treaty, but they do not immunise Australia from any of these claims. If the trade minister is saying, \u2018We\u2019re not at risk for regulating environmental matters\u2019, then the trade minister is wrong.\u201d <br></p> <p>Speaking via Skype from his office in New York, Kahale thumbs through the investment chapter, pointing out the critical loopholes that leave Australia wide open. \u201cThe one where all the discussion should be focused is 9.15,\u201d he says, referring to one of the \u201csafeguards\u201d. \u201cThat\u2019s a very nice provision, which I imagine the trade minister points to as, \u2018We\u2019ve really protected ourselves on anything of social importance.\u2019 I think that\u2019s nonsense, frankly.\u201d </p> <p>Here\u2019s what 9.15 says: \u201cNothing in this chapter shall be construed to prevent a party from adopting, maintaining or enforcing any measure otherwise consistent with this chapter that it considers appropriate to ensure that investment activity in its territory is undertaken in a manner sensitive to environmental, health or other regulatory objectives.\u201d </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/nov/06/trans-pacific-partnership-four-key-issues-to-watch-out-for\">Trans-Pacific Partnership: four key issues to watch out for</a> </p> </aside>  <p>This entire provision is negated, says Kahale, by five words in the middle: \u201cunless otherwise consistent with this chapter\u201d. \u201cSo at the end of the day, this provision, which really held out a lot of promise of being very protective, is actually much ado about nothing.\u201d<br></p> <p>Kahale says many provisions in the TPP investment chapter are a vast improvement on previous trade deals. But he says all this hard work could be for nothing because of another provision. \u201cWhy would you spend so much time and effort doing a great job in negotiating narrow provisions to this treaty, when you have a \u2018most favoured nation\u2019 clause?\u201d <br></p> <p>This is where things get a little technical. Essentially, an MFN clause is tantamount to a classic wipeout move. It would enable foreign corporations from TPP states to make a claim against Australia based on the ISDS provisions in <em>any other trade deal </em>Australia has signed, no matter which country it was signed with. That means it does not matter how carefully the TPP is drafted: foreign investors can cherrypick another treaty Australia has signed, and sue the Australian government based on the provisions included in that treaty. Kahale has described MFN as \u201ca dangerous provision to be avoided by treaty drafters whenever possible\u201d because it can turn one bad treaty into protections \u201cnever imagined for virtually an entire world of investors\u201d. </p> <p>Including an MFN clause in the TPP was a \u201cmajor mistake\u201d, Kahale argues, and another reason Australia is still wide open to being sued for legislating to protect the environment. <br></p> <p>If you are curious about what this might look like, take Germany, for example. The German government has had two claims brought against it by the same corporation, Vattenfall, a Swedish energy company. </p> <p>First, Vattenfall sued the government for \u20ac1.4bn over the Hamburg provincial government\u2019s decision to place extra environmental restrictions on a coal-fired power plant the company was planning to build along the river Elbe. To settle this case, Germany had to remove the restrictions. </p> <p>In 2012, Vattenfall announced it was suing the German government again, this time over its decision to phase out nuclear power after the Fukushima nuclear disaster. This was in breach of its contract to allow the company to build and operate nuclear power plants, claimed Vattenfall, which has lodged another claim against Germany, reported to be worth \u20ac4bn. </p> <p>Billion-dollar claims are becoming the norm, says Kahale, citing a recent case in Ecuador, where the government now owes more than $1bn to the multinational oil company Occidental. \u201cThat is a huge number for Ecuador! From my reading of the facts, and my reading of the decision, terrible mistakes were made. The decision was 2-1 to begin with, with a very strong dissent. Now you can be sure, if they\u2019d had a different panel of arbitrators, that could just as easily have been 2-1 the other way.\u201d</p> <p>The problem with ISDS is not just that corporations can sue governments, says Kahale, but that its entire legal framework is fundamentally flawed. ISDS claims are not heard in a standing court staffed by independent judges. Instead, claims can proceed in ad hoc courtrooms \u2013 a hotel room, for example \u2013 by three arbitrators hand-picked by the parties. Unlike a traditional court of law, these arbitrators are not obliged to refer to precedent and, since their decisions are not open to appeal, they are free to rule according to their personal opinion. The arbitrators can also be severely conflicted, says Kahale, because they may act as a judge one day and as a lawyer for a party the next. </p> <p>Kahale\u2019s criticisms have been echoed by Robert French, the chief justice of Australia\u2019s high court. In a speech last July, he said: \u201cArbitral tribunals set up under ISDS provisions are not courts, nor are they required to act like courts, yet their decisions may include awards which significantly impact on national economies and on regulatory systems within nation states.\u201d<br></p> <p>Kahale believes the ISDS system is so badly flawed it should be abolished, and started again from scratch. Australia, he warns, should think very carefully before signing up to it in the TPP. <br></p> <p>\u201cWhat I would say to Australians is that while the system is in the state it\u2019s in right now, signing any new treaty is a very serious mistake. You have to weigh the benefits against the burdens. Somebody at some point might be able to explain to me where all the benefits are, but I certainly haven\u2019t seen any.\u201d </p>",

      "bodyText": "Britain\u2019s retailers experienced a drop in sales last month, according to industry figures that suggest shoppers are putting off spending in anticipation of the discounts on Black Friday at the end of November. The British Retail Consortium also said that with Halloween falling on a Saturday this year fewer people went shopping on that key day for the sector. Retail sales in October were down 0.2% on a like-for-like basis compared with the same month last year, according to the BRC\u2019s monthly retail sales monitor. The drop marked a change in fortunes after a sharp 2.6% rise in annual sales in September \u2013 although those figures were distorted by the timing of the end of summer bank holiday. The rise of the US-inspired Black Friday has changed the way UK households do their Christmas shopping. The event, which falls on 27 November this year, has led to heavy discounting on electronic and electrical goods. Fashion retailers have also started offering price cuts on the day, which follows Thanksgiving in the US in an effort to get people shopping again after the holiday. The BRC said the prospect of Black Friday deals had depressed sales of small household appliances last month. \u201cOctober was a somewhat disappointing month overall for retailers,\u201d its chief executive, Helen Dickinson, said. \u201cA number of categories which we would typically expect to be popular on Black Friday saw a slowdown in October, suggesting that some shoppers may be holding out in the hope of some great deals at the end of November. \u201cFurniture had a good month, however, probably boosted by higher disposable incomes. Clothing also did well last month, driven by mid-season sales. However this may be to the detriment of retailers\u2019 profit margins.\u201d Grocers continued to face pressure on margins from price cuts and were also hurt by England\u2019s early exit from the Rugby World Cup, which was seen to have affected alcohol sales. Food falls again Food sales, which the BRC reports for the latest three months, were down 1.1% in like-for like terms from the same three months in 2014, continuing a declining pattern. Market researchers IGD, which compiled the food figures for BRC, said consumers were keeping a tight hold on the purse strings despite an improvement in household incomes. \u201cDeflation continues to dampen down the figures which is good news for shoppers, even though most view it as a short-term windfall,\u201d said IGD\u2019s chief executive, Joanne Denney-Finch. \u201cOur research shows only one in 10 shoppers expect food prices to fall again in the coming year. This cautious mood helps explain why the combination of rising incomes and falling prices has triggered only a modest amount of trading up on food and drink so far. However, this could change as we enter the crucial Christmas trading phase.\u201d",
