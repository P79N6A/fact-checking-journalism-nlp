      "bodyText": "The release of the latest cost of living indexes shows that for all types of households the cost of living continues to grow well below long-term averages. But in September the impact of electricity price rises most affected aged pensioner and other government beneficiary households. For these households, who have mostly missed out on the benefits of falling interest rates, it means that they remain the most affected by cost of living pressures. Unlike the consumer price index, which provides an estimate of average price increases for all Australian households, the quarterly cost of living index acknowledges that different households have different spending needs. While the CPI does differentiate between households in each capital city, the reality is the spending patterns of household with two working adults with two kids varies little regardless of where you live. But the spending patterns of that household would be greatly different to that of two aged pensioners living together \u2013 even if they lived right next door to the family of four. So while increases in electricity, food etc will vary across the nation, the impact of those changes will also vary dependent upon your situation in life \u2013 both in terms of work and age. The cost of living indexes also take into account the change in the cost of paying off a mortgage, whereas the CPI does not \u2013 instead it looks at the price of buying a new home for owner occupiers. The ABS breaks down cost of living according to four types of households \u2013 employee, age pensioner, other government recipients, and self-funded retirees. Since 2007 it has also included an average of the first two \u2013 \u201cpensioner and beneficiary households\u201d \u2013 known as the \u201cPBLCI\u201d, which is used in the indexing of the age pension and some other government benefits. In September, the cost of living for all households except pensioners rose by more than the CPI, with households of non-aged pension benefits being hit the hardest: The cost of living for age pensioner households rose just 0.5%, and was up only 1.7% over the past year \u2013 less again than the 1.8% increase in the CPI. For the first time in the past year and a half, the cost of living for aged pensioner households rose by less than employee households. The reason is that age pensioner households spend more of their budget on food and non-alcoholic beverages than the average family, and that group of items dropped in price in September \u2013 led by a 10.9% drop in vegetables. Eating your greens like your grandma told you to certainly was a boon for your wallet in the past three months: Age pensioner households also spend less on tobacco than other households, though a bit more on alcohol. In September, the price of tobacco went up 4.1% while alcohol only rose 0.5% (and the biggest price increase was beer with 0.9%). So non-smoking, vegetable eating and wine drinking households did well. But using electricity hit everyone, and in this regard pensioner households spend more of their money than most. Such households spend 3.4% of their weekly budget on electricity compared to just 1.9% for employee households. This is due to a few factors, but mostly that while employee households might use more electricity because on average their households are bigger, they also have more money to spend. Similarly, pensioners are more affected by property rates because these are relatively fixed \u2013 people living in two same sized houses next door to each other will pay similar council rates regardless of the income of the occupants. And because employee households are much more likely to be ones with a mortgage, those households on average spend much more of their weekly budget paying interest than other households who are more likely to be renting or have paid off their house: This is why since the end of 2011, when the RBA began to cut rates, the cost of living for the average employee household has risen by less than the CPI: Since September 2011, the CPI has risen 11.6% and the RBA\u2019s underlying inflation measure has gone up 13% but the cost of living for employee households has risen just 7.1%. By contrast, the cost of living for age pensioner households has risen 10.5% and households of other government benefits by the most at 11.4%. And to give you a sense of how important falling interest rates have been, if we excluded the impact of insurance and financial services charges, the cost of living for employee households in that period would have gone from 7.1% to 8.8%: But in the past nine months, those payments have been rising: The cost of living figures show that, as with inflation, we are living in very slow growth times. The increase in electricity certainly had an impact, but the slow growth or fall in prices of other items means cost of living generally is growing much slower than it has in the past. The impact of electricity prices most hurt aged pensioner households \u2013 but their spending habits and general lack of a mortgage meant overall they actually did better than others. While over the past five years the biggest driver of the low growth in the cost of living has been falling interest rates, the end of that benefit appears to be in sight. Interest rates may not be on the rise, but they are no longer falling, and thus in September at least, retirees did better. But for those on government benefits the picture remains grim with once again their cost of living growing by more than any other household.",

When chief executive Lord Wolfson sounded mildly cheerful (for him) about sales in September, Next\u2019s shares jumped 10%. Now he has joined the rest of the retail brigade in grumbling about the warm October, they fell 9%. Up to a point, blaming temperatures is fair. It\u2019s no longer true that \u201cweather is for wimps\u201d, as a former boss of Marks &amp; Spencer used to say. Internet shopping, coupled with overnight deliveries, has changed behaviour. Fewer people buy clothes ahead of time. Retailers more directly compete with other attractions, like going out. But let\u2019s not overdo the excuses. Two other points seem reasonably clear. First, the dire October probably only exaggerated trends that look worrying for retailers. Real incomes are being squeezed, confidence in house prices in falling and credit card debt is too high. Maybe the lost October sales will be recouped in the Christmas run-in, but there\u2019s no guarantee. The second point relates directly to Next. Its weak sales were entirely concentrated in its stores, as opposed to the online operation. The Directory business was up 13.2% in the quarter. The shops, by contrast, turned in minus 7.7%, which is their average for the year so far. Given that Next is still adding space, the stores\u2019 like-for-like decline will be about 10%. In the round, that is not an immediate problem for Next. The principle of swings and roundabouts applies. Online progress meant the group could stick to its profit forecast for the year of \u00a3717m-ish. Yet a 10% drop-off in the stores is an astonishing figure, even by industry standards. Back in March, when Wolfson was explaining that Next\u2019s short leases gave valuable flexibility and protection, he was talking about 6% like-for-like declines in the stores as being a gloomy long-term assumption. The current rate is faster \u2013 much faster. Maybe Next\u2019s shops are just more than averagely dull these days. It\u2019s one more worry to add to a lengthening list. FRC register may persuade sceptics about watchdog\u2019s independence The Financial Reporting Council, the accountancy watchdog, resents suggestions it is a cosy club of former auditors that lacks the independence to make tough judgments against big firms. The FRC has been hearing such complaints a lot lately, especially after it declared there was nothing wrong with KPMG\u2019s 2007 audit of the failed HBOS. In the interests of greater transparency, FRC chairman Sir Win Bischoff announced in September that a register of its top officials\u2019 interests would be published. \u201cSuch a register is important for the FRC to retain confidence in how it reaches decisions, particularly on enforcement matters,\u201d he said. And what does the register reveal? It turns out that FRC chief executive Stephen Haddrill is married to the senior civil servant, Kate Marshall, who has responsibility for managing the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy\u2019s relationship with the FRC. No conflicts of interest have arisen in practice, say both the FRC and BEIS, and the proper internal disclosures were made promptly. What\u2019s more, as Bishcoff argued in September, board members like Haddrill do not take enforcement decisions; a separate panel takes on investigations like the KPMG/HBOS one. All the same, the set-up looks uncomfortable. The board of the FRC appoints the chief executive, but both the chairman and deputy chairman of the watchdog are appointed directly by the secretary of state, presumably with the help of advice from the relevant civil servant. The FRC and BEIS may see no problem. But, if you\u2019re trying to persuade sceptical outsiders that you\u2019re running a robust shop with independent oversight, this news is not ideal. Bank deputy governor\u2019s sounds urgent warning from City frontline Would 10,000 jobs leaving the City on \u201cday one\u201d of Brexit count as a lot? If you\u2019re so minded, it\u2019s possible to shrug your shoulders. The figure represents about 2% of the total number of people employed in bank and insurance roles in the City. Yet breezy disregard is surely the wrong stance. First, as Bank of England deputy governor Sam Woods explained to peers on Wednesday, a \u201cplausible\u201d grand total may be nearer 75,000 once the dust settles. That number assumes there is no transition deal between the UK and the EU and includes knock-on job losses outside the City. If it also implies \u00a310bn less in tax revenues, as lobbyists contend, that\u2019s a heavy whack that will be felt by everybody. Second, merely counting jobs and taxes doesn\u2019t tell the full story. The Bank\u2019s direct worry is about disruption. It is responsible for the safety and soundness of the UK\u2019s financial system and there are 150 EU banks and financial services firms that needed to be authorised to operate here after Brexit. That work requires more than ticking boxes. Woods has been saying for months that a transition deal \u2013 agreed soon \u2013 is vital to make the Brexit process orderly.

      "bodyText": "Investors took fright on Wednesday after Next reported a fall in October high street sales, in the latest sign that retailers face difficult trading conditions in the run-up to the crucial Christmas selling period. Next\u2019s shares closed down more than 9% at \u00a344.71 \u2013 the biggest faller in the FTSE 100 \u2013 after it warned of \u201cextremely volatile\u201d trading, with shop sales falling in October, reversing gains made in the preceding two months. Overall, the clothing retailer said sales at its shops were down by 7.7% in the three months to 29 October. \u201cWeek-by-week sales volatility makes it very hard to determine any underlying sales trend,\u201d Next said in a trading update. \u201cSales performance has remained extremely volatile and is highly dependent on the seasonality of the weather. In August and September sales were significantly up on last year, as cooler temperatures improved sales of warmer-weight stock.\u201d The unexpectedly downbeat figures from Next, the UK\u2019s biggest clothing retailer, prompted investor pessimism about the prospects for high street sales in the run-up to Christmas to spread to other retailers. Marks &amp; Spencer, which is due to deliver its half-year update to the City next week, fell by almost 4.5%, while Sainsbury\u2019s (down 2.6%) and Primark owner Associated British Foods (down 2.1%) were also among the biggest FSTE 100 fallers. FTSE 250 retailers Card Factory, Dixons Carphone and Dunelm were also hit by the weaker sentiment, and were among the day\u2019s worst performers on the index. Next\u2019s disappointing October high street figures come after a CBI survey published last week in which retailers reported a steep drop in sales for the month. The business trade body warned of softening demand as inflation ate into Britons\u2019 spending power, with department stores and specialist food and drink outlets bearing the brunt of the spending slowdown. Next\u2019s Directory catalogue sales, including online, increased 13.2%, pushing total sales for full-price items up by 1.3% over the three months to 29 October. The retailer\u2019s third-quarter performance was actually better than the previous two quarters - when full-price sales grew by 0.7% and -3% respectively \u2013 but it was significantly below the 4% growth predicted by some analysts. Sales over the first nine months of the financial year were down by 0.3%. Retail analyst Nick Bubb described the slide in Next\u2019s high street sales as \u201csickening\u201d. \u201cIf such a distinguished guru as [Next chief execuive] Simon Wolfson finds it impossible to read the underlying sales trends, because of the volatility of the weather, then what are we mere mortals to do?\u201d George Salmon, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said the weak sales growth over the last three months had taken the City by surprise. He added: \u201cWhile the recent investment in digital marketing seems to have helped the Directory division rediscover its mojo, Next\u2019s high street stores saw an almighty slump this quarter. A particularly weak October means the group enters the all-important Christmas period with less momentum than it would have liked. \u201cWhile clearly not good news for Next investors, these results won\u2019t have gone unnoticed by others across the market either. Shareholders in Marks &amp; Spencer, for example, might now be a bit more nervous ahead of next week\u2019s half-year numbers.\u201d Next overtook its high street rival M&amp;S in terms of annual profits in 2014, as Marks struggled to make its clothing ranges appeal to younger shoppers. Next expects pre-tax profits to fall from \u00a3790m in the year ending January 2017 to somewhere in the range between \u00a3692m and \u00a3742m for its full financial year ending January 2018. It was previously predicting a range of \u00a3687m to \u00a3747m. The retailer said total full-price sales growth over the year was likely to be between \u20131.75% and 1.25%, having previously expected a range between \u20132% and 1.5%. Next said it was expecting sales in the fourth quarter to fall by about 0.3%, partly because of tough sales comparisons from a year earlier. UK retailers are facing a challenging backdrop in the run-up to the key Christmas trading period. Real pay is falling as prices rise at a faster pace than wages, putting pressure on household budgets and making cash-strapped consumers less willing to spend money. Monthly outgoings could be set to rise further for some UK mortgage holders, with Bank of England policymakers expected to raise interest rates to 0.5% from the current all-time low of 0.25% on Thursday.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "HSBC has been accused of \u201cpossible criminal complicity\u201d in a money laundering scandal involving South Africa\u2019s wealthy Gupta family. Speaking in the House of Lords on Wednesday, two weeks after he first voiced concerns about UK links to the probe, Lord Hain said he had handed new evidence to the chancellor about the alleged involvement of a British bank in the \u201cflagrant robbery\u201d of South African taxpayers. Hain did not mention the name the bank in the Lords but did so in a letter to the Philip Hammond, in which he said the bank should be investigated over \u201cpossible criminal complicity\u201d in corruption. Hain, a former anti-apartheid activist, had earlier written to Hammond, attaching printouts of bank transfers and asking him to pass them to the Serious Fraud Office (SFO), National Crime Agency (NCA) and Financial Conduct Authority (FCA). A Treasury spokesperson confirmed Hammond had asked the agencies to examine the transactions. The Gupta corruption scandal began when the Indian-born family was accused of allegedly using its vast wealth to wield influence over South Africa\u2019s president, Jacob Zuma. The Guptas and Zuma deny any wrongdoing. Hain told the Lords he had obtained information that \u201cshows illegal transfers of funds from South Africa made by the Gupta family over the last few years from their South African accounts to accounts held in Dubai and Hong Kong\u201d. \u201cMany of the transactions are legitimate, but many certainly are not,\u201d he said. \u201cThe latter illicit transactions were flagged internally as suspicious, but I am informed that they were told by the UK headquarters to ignore it. \u201cThat is an iniquitous breach of legal banking practice which I trust ministers would never countenance and is an incitement to money laundering, which has self-evidently occurred in this case, and also been sanctioned by a British bank, as part of the flagrant robbery of South African taxpayers of many millions.\u201d Hain said the transactions were disguised, originating from one bank account before being split in a number of different accounts. He told the Lords: \u201cUndoubtedly, hard questions will need to be asked of the facilitating banks, because they have aided and abetted the Gupta money laundering activities.\u201d The former Labour minister\u2019s latest intervention comes two weeks after the chancellor referred concerns about Standard Chartered and HSBC to the FCA, SFO and NCA. He did so after Hain wrote to him saying high-level sources in South Africa had alerted him to the exposure of British financial institutions to the affair. Standard Chartered has since said that it closed bank accounts in 2014 because of concerns about potential links to the scandal. In the Lords, Hain called on the chancellor to \u201censure that such evident money laundering and illegality is not tolerated and that the bank is investigated for a possible criminal complicity over this matter. \u201cUrgent action is needed to close down this network of corruption.\u201d HSBC\u2019s chief executive, Stuart Gulliver, said on Monday that the bank was \u201cresponding to those inquiries that have come in from the FCA and also from South African authorities, and there is nothing more I can really add at this point in time\u201d. An FCA spokesperson said it was in contact with both banks named and would \u201cconsider carefully further responses received\u201d.",

      "bodyText": "Commenting on the Fed decision, Kully Samra, UK managing director of Charles Schwab, said: A widely expected move from the Fed with market consensus anticipating one further rate hike in December. A more aggressive Fed could have posed a problem for equities, but for now the Fed\u2019s methodical approach to monetary policy tightening is reassuring investors and ensuring the continuation of the bull run. The Fed has an important balancing act to play as it slowly continues to normalise monetary policy by gradually lifting interest rates and unwinding its bloated balance sheet. We expect earnings season to propel stocks to further gains. However, signs of inflation and the potential of a melt-up do pose some risks. The US economy\u2019s outlook is also bolstered by broadly strengthening global economic growth and the continued rise in global earnings may support further stock market gains. So on Thursday we are due to get the perhaps more important Fed news - Donald Trump\u2019s pick for the next chair of the US central bank. Also coming up is the Bank of England rate decision, which is widely expected to see the first rise for a decade. On that note, it\u2019s time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. One key point from the Fed statement. It says \u201ceconomic activity has been rising at a solid rate despite hurricane-related disruptions.\u201d In September it said economic activity \u201chas been rising moderately so far this year.\u201d This slightly more positive comment adds to the idea of a rate rise in December. And here\u2019s a comparison of today\u2019s Fed statement with the September comments: The Fed\u2019s statement says: In view of realized and expected labor market conditions and inflation, the Committee decided to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 1 to 1-1/4 percent. The stance of monetary policy remains accommodative, thereby supporting some further strengthening in labor market conditions and a sustained return to 2 percent inflation. And the comments about changes in rates are unchanged from the September meeting: In determining the timing and size of future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will assess realized and expected economic conditions relative to its objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation. This assessment will take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial and international developments. The Committee will carefully monitor actual and expected inflation developments relative to its symmetric inflation goal. The Committee expects that economic conditions will evolve in a manner that will warrant gradual increases in the federal funds rate; the federal funds rate is likely to remain, for some time, below levels that are expected to prevail in the longer run. However, the actual path of the federal funds rate will depend on the economic outlook as informed by incoming data. Breaking News: The Federal Reserve has kept US interest rates on hold, as expected, but left open the prospect of an increase at its December meeting. Here\u2019s ING from earlier today on the Fed: The Federal Reserve\u2019s latest interest rate decision is due in less than an hour, and while no change is expected this time round, analysts will be looking for clues as to whether a rise is nailed on for December. Given the relatively strong economic data recently, this seems fairly probable, but the observers will be looking out for clues from the nuances of the accompanying statement. In some ways the Fed decision is not the most important event for the US central bank this week. On Thursday Donald Trump is expected to announce his pick for the new Fed chair, with the dovish Jerome Powell said to be the frontrunner to replace Janet Yellen. Although Yellen herself may not be completely out of the picture, the choice of Powell would suggest to investors that the Fed is likely to continue on its present course of gradual interest rate rises as the economic conditions dictate. Craig Erlam, senior market analyst at Oanda, said: The Fed\u2019s monetary policy decision would typically be one of, if not the most important event of the week but that may not be the case today. For one, it\u2019s extremely unlikely that any change in interest rates will be announced, with December remaining far more likely for the final hike of the year. With Chair Janet Yellen not making an appearance after the announcement, we instead have to rely on the accompanying statement for clues as to whether another hike in December is still planned. Moreover, with Donald Trump poised to announce who will succeed Yellen from February on Thursday, investors may take the statement with a pinch of salt when considering interest rates beyond the end of the year. All things considered, not only is today\u2019s announcement not the biggest market event this week, it\u2019s unlikely to even be the most important Fed event. When it comes to the statement, I don\u2019t expect the central bank to deviate much, if at all, from previous rhetoric as the data has been broadly consistent with expectations, barring the understandable weak jobs report last month. This Friday\u2019s report is expected to be much better than normal which should mostly offset the weakness in job creation in September, something the Fed may allude to. Josh Mahony, market analyst at IG Group, said: Today\u2019s focus will no doubt fall on the Fed, with the penultimate FOMC meeting of the year happening just a day before Trump announces his pick for the Fed chair. With markets widely expecting to see Trump opt for Jerome Powell, there is no doubt that Janet Yellen will want to deliver the three rate hikes that were initially set out in the dot plot at the turn of the year. While today\u2019s meeting may not bring the kind of volatility and excitement of tomorrow\u2019s Bank of England announcement, today is a key determinant of market expectations as we seek to narrow down exactly how likely a rate hike is for December. Stefan Gerlach, chief economist at EPG Bank and former deputy governor of the Central Bank of Ireland, looks at the potential candidates for the Fed chair: The first is Jerome Powell, who has served as a Fed Governor since 2012, and who is seen as the favourite. Prior to that he was Assistant Secretary and Under-Secretary of the Treasury under President George H.W. Bush. Before that he was a lawyer and investment banker in New York. The second candidate often mentioned is John Taylor, who was Treasury Under-Secretary for International Affairs, 2001- 2005, and who developed the Taylor Rule, discussed below, as a means of describing the way in which the Fed sets interest rates. While these two candidates are the current favourites, it is of course possible that somebody else will be appointed, or that Chair Yellen will be reappointed. As US investors await the latest Federal Reserve interest rate decision, most European markets have ended the first day of the new month on a positive note. Buoyed by weakness in the euro after last week\u2019s European Central Bank meeting, French, German and Italian markets have closed in positive territory, with Germany\u2019s Dax in particular playing catch up after Tuesday\u2019s public holiday. Spain\u2019s Ibex, however, has edged lower on profit taking after its recent gains, which were prompted by fading fears about the Catalan independence demands. The FTSE 100 slipped back despite a positive performance from the mining sector after Chinese manufacturing data. Next proved a drag on the index after its badly received results, and helped pull other retailers lower as well. On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average moved higher ahead of the Fed news. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 fell 5.12 points or 0.07% to 7487.96 Germany\u2019s Dax jumped 1.78% to 13,465.51 France\u2019s Cac closed up 0.2% at 5514.29 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB finished up 0.87% at 22,991.99 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended down 0.16% at 10,506.7 In Greece, the Athens market added 1.02% to 767.07 On Wall Street, the Dow is currently up 49 points or 0.21%. The main focus for US investors is the Federal Reserve meeting later - widely expected to keep rates on hold but hit at an increase in December - and Thursday\u2019s announcement of Donald Trump\u2019s pick for the next Fed chair. Meanwhile the US economic data continues to be strong. As well as the reasonable manufacturing data, there were also some positive jobs numbers, ahead of Friday\u2019s official non-farm payroll numbers. The monthly ADP report showed private employers hired 235,000 workers in October, better than the 200,000 figures analysts had been expecting. It was also much better than September\u2019s 110,000 figure, albeit this was revised down from the initial estimate of a 135,000 increase. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said: It was a pretty strong afternoon for US data. The ADP non-farm employment change reading hit 235k, sharply higher than last month\u2019s 110k, to set up a potentially massive \u2018official\u2019 number on Friday, while the final Markit manufacturing PMI for October came in a tad higher than forecast at 54.6. Only the ISM manufacturing figure disappointed, and even then, at 58.7, it was a more than respectable number. The dollar was the main beneficiary of all this (the Dow Jones lost roughly a third of its early gains, though after rising 100 points it\u2019s still at a fresh all time high). The greenback reversed its initial losses against the pound to climb 0.1%-0.2%, sending cable back below $1.33, while against the euro it jumped 0.2%. This reaction was assumedly related to the hawkish-tinge of the day\u2019s data, with investors hoping the Federal Reserve tees up a December rate hike with this evening\u2019s statement. Estate agent Jones Lang LaSalle has just published its latest forecasts for UK house price growth in the next five years. It has pencilled in an average of 2.5% growth a year \u2013 down from an average of 6.9% in the last 20 years. The firm is predicting a big shift to a more stable housing market with \u201cmore moderate UK house price growth over the next five to ten years\u201d - despite Brexit. Growth is expected to average just 1% next year but then pick up to 2% in 2019, 2.5% in 2020, 3% in 2021 and 3.5% in 2022. Transactions are also set to slow, averaging 1.23m a year over the next five years. The firm said: Brexit will not get in the way of a more stable and healthy UK housing market. In central London we expect demand for new developments to remain muted but steady over the next two years until the Brexit road becomes clearer. A bedrock of demand will continue from domestic owner-occupiers supported by a steady stream of international buyers and investors. Activity in prime central London will be subdued for the next two years with continued pressure on pricing especially at the top end of the market where stamp duty impacts are greatest. Britain\u2019s retail sector continues to be rattled by Next\u2019s warning that trading is \u2018extremely volatile\u2019. Next\u2019s shares are certainly out of fashion, down 8.5% right now at the bottom of the FTSE 100 losers column. Other retailers are sharing the gloom; Marks &amp; Spencer have lost 4%, Dixons Carphone have lost 2%, and Ocado are down 1.9%. They\u2019d all be vulnerable to a slowdown in consumer spending (which might accelerate if the Bank of England raises interest rates tomorrow). Helal Miah, investment research analyst at The Share Centre, says investors are worried that Next\u2019s high street sales slumped by 7.7% over the last quarter. These results are a reflection of the wider issues facing the retail sector. Investors continue to face challenges to their spending power as well as the structural shift to online shopping. Moreover, the vagaries of the British weather have only proved to be a hindrance. We have in general been fairly pessimistic towards the retail sector and nothing has really changed that sentiment. Over in Greece finance minister Euclid Tsakalotos has announced that Athens is likely to make at least four market forays before its current bailout programme expires next year. Helena Smith reports from Athens: In a late night interview, the Oxford-educated finance minister confirmed reports that Greece was poised to tap bond markets again saying the foray was a purposeful move to improve the country\u2019s debt profile. He told the state new channel ERT-1 that: \u201cThe issue is to have access to markets when we exit the programme,\u201d In a bid to prepare the ground \u2013 and make Greek bonds more attractive - Athens plans at least four market forays in the run up to August 2018 when the country\u2019s current \u20ac86bn euro aid programme officially ends. To boost liquidity the government is considering swapping twenty bonds issued in 2012 after a restructuring of Greek debt held by private investors for four or five new bonds. Hinting that a test run was imminent, Tskakalotos said investors would \u201cdemand [Greece\u2019s] return\u201d to bond markets before international auditors representing creditors at the EU and IMF, wrap up a third compliance review as part of the bailout programme. The review is expected to be completed by January after inspectors return to the country at the end of November. Once concluded, Greece will start negotiating the terms of its exit from international supervision. At 180 % of GDP, Greece has the highest debt load in the EU. There are also reports that a senior EU official in Brussels has suggested that debt relief could be linked to further reforms once the current bailout programme ends. America\u2019s factory sector appears to be in good health, says Michael Pierce of Capital Economics. Here\u2019s his take on today\u2019s manufacturing data: The small drop back in the ISM Manufacturing Index in October from a 13-year high is little to worry about, and still suggests that manufacturing output will rebound in the fourth quarter. The drop back in the headline index, from 60.8 to 58.7, took it back almost exactly in line with its value in August. Perversely, some of the decline in the index this month reflects an unwinding of hurricane effects. The disruption to supply chains caused delivery times to surge in September (interpreted in the ISM index as a positive sign of stronger demand), which was partly reversed last month. ISM\u2019s rival US manufacturing survey is also out, and it suggests growth slowed but remained very strong: Breaking: America\u2019s factory sector is expanding at its fastest rate since January. Markit\u2019s US manufacturing PMI rose to 54.6 in October, up from 53.1 in September. That\u2019s comfortably over the 50-point mark separating expansion from contraction. US factory bosses also reported that they took on more staff last month, at the fastest pace in over two years. This comes hot on the heels of some other strong jobs data today, showing that US firms hired staff at the fastest rate in 18 months. Wall Street traders have held a moment\u2019s silence as a mark of respect for those who were killed in Tuesday\u2019s truck attack in New York. Trading is now underway, and the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq have both hit new record highs as the market rally continues. Labour MP Wes Streeting says the government must heed the warning that 75,000 City jobs could be lost through Brexit, and avoid a \u2018hard\u2019 departure from the EU. \u201cIt\u2019s clear that British companies are already preparing to shift jobs abroad as a result of Brexit. Our economy is being damaged now, with growth slowing and prices rising, and the situation is set to get worse as a hard and destructive Brexit gets closer. \u201cOnly by keeping Britain in the Single Market can the Government reassure financial services firms and stem job losses. But they have made an ideological choice to wrench our country out of the world\u2019s biggest trading area. \u201cWe were told that Brexit would not lead to job losses. As people see the harm that is being done to our economy, they have every right to keep on open mind on Britain\u2019s future relationship with Europe.\u201d Back in the House of Lords, Bank of England deputy governor Jon Cunliffe has warned that the regulation of financial clearing houses could suffer after Brexit. These clearing houses sit between investors, settling trades, and (hopefully) avoiding financial contagion breaking out. European officials argue that they should supervise euro clearing (much of which takes place in London today). But Cunliffe fears this would lead to disruption. He told the Lords EU Financial Affairs Sub-Committee that: \u201cYou have to make sure you don\u2019t end up with multiple hands on the steering wheel and multiple feet on the brake.\u201d The BoE is also concerned that huge numbers of cross-border derivative contracts and insurance policies would be disrupted by Brexit. If Britain leaves the EU without a deal, there could be no agreement on how these derivatives contracts are regulated. Deputy governor Sam Woods says negotiators need to find a solution. \u201cBy far the best fix would be for something to be included in the withdrawal bill. There would have to be bilateral agreement to fix this on both sides.\u201d Despite fears over Brexit\u2019s impact on Anglo-Irish trade, Ireland\u2019s consumer exports to the UK are up by 12%, it emerged today. Enterprise Ireland said the export of Irish consumer goods and services is now worth \u20ac500m. The Irish government business agency puts a lot of the rise in exports to Britain down to better use of online sales and other innovations. Allyson Stephen, market advisor at Enterprise Ireland said: \u201cIn a crowded market such as Britain, knowing your market is essential before targeting buyers and while there are similarities between Irish and British consumers, in a business context there are vital differences, such as continuous and new and developing routes to market which must be recognised. Back in the City, Next\u2019s shares ares still down over 7% after this morning\u2019s disappointing sales update. That, by my maths, wipes \u00a3540m off the company\u2019s market capitalisation, from \u00a37.17bn to around \u00a36.6bn. That makes Next the worst performing stock on the Stoxx 600 index (which tracks Europe\u2019s largest companies). My colleague Angela Monaghan explains what went wrong: Investors took fright on Thursday after Next reported a fall in high street sales and warned trading was \u201cextremely volatile\u201d ahead of its crucial Christmas selling period. Next shares fell by 8%, making it the biggest loser on the FTSE 100, after the clothing retailer said sales at its shops fell by 7.7% in the three months to 29 October. Thanks to a 13.2% increase in Directory sales, including online, total sales for full-price items rose by 1.3% over the quarter. However, some analysts had been expecting total sales growth of more than 4%. More here: Another deputy governor, Jon Cunliffe, tells the Lords committee that City firms will assume a \u201cworst case\u201d scenario on Brexit, unless they can see what the final \u2018end framework\u2019 of a deal will be. Simply agreeing a transition period, with no clarity about what the final agreement might be, isn\u2019t enough..... Over at the House of Lords, Sam Woods, deputy governor of the Bank of England, has told peers that 10,000 City jobs could be lost on \u201cday one\u201d after Brexit. Testifying to the Lords EU Financial Affairs Sub-Committee, Woods also says that the BoE believes it is \u201cplausible\u201d that up to 75,000 roles could go in the long-term, as consultancy Oliver Wyman has estimated. Woods, who runs the regulatory arm of the Bank, has already asked 400 banks and financial firms for their contingency plans in the event of a hard Brexit. He said that some of those plans were already being put in place - reserving school places, hiring office space etc - but that plans would be put in place in earnest in the first quarter of the year. You can watch the session online here. Today\u2019s news highlights the dilemma facing the Bank of England\u2019s policymakers, as they try to decide whether to raise interest rates tomorrow. On one side, they have one of Britain\u2019s biggest retailers reporting weak, volatile sales - a sign that consumers are vulnerable and cutting back. That\u2019s a reason to leave borrowing costs unchanged. On the other, they can see Britain\u2019s factories growing steadily, with production rising and - perhaps crucially for the BoE - price pressures rising. That\u2019s a reason to raise borrowing costs towards more normal levels, probably bolstering the pound and pulling inflation down. We\u2019ll find out at noon on Thursday whether the Monetary Policy Committee has voted for its first interest rate rise in a decade.... Importantly, UK factories which produce consumer goods are lagging behind the rest of the sector, according to today\u2019s report. Markit says: Intermediate and investment goods producers both saw rising production volumes backed up by strong and accelerated intakes of new business. Conditions seemed less firm in the consumer goods category, however, as growth of new orders eased to a seven-month low and business optimism to its weakest level in the year-to-date. The news that Britain\u2019s manufacturers grew at a faster pace in October has cheered industry experts and City economists. Here\u2019s some snap reaction: Duncan Brock, of the Chartered Institute of Procurement &amp; Supply: \u201cIt\u2019s good to see the manufacturing sector holding strong and steady in October, buoyed up by an increase in new orders from the domestic market and improving on last month\u2019s results. While trade from export markets slowed slightly, orders from overseas continued to rise for the 18th month supported by a robust global economy. The pound\u2019s fluctuating performance may have had some bearing on the softening in export orders, but there were continuing good levels of demand from Europe and the USA so no cause for concern. Dave Atkinson, UK head of manufacturing at Lloyds Bank Commercial Banking. \u201cThe UK manufacturing sector has recorded another month well above the magic 50 mark that signifies growth and continues to perform well. \u201cWhile the ongoing Brexit negotiations are causing uncertainty, recent CBI data shows orders and outputs are above historic levels, and similar trends are seen in exporting data. Firms\u2019 plans for investment in innovation remain strong, as does spending on training and development. Mike Rigby, Head of Manufacturing at Barclays: \u201cMonth after month, manufacturing continues to hold its own delivering growth levels that keep the sector in positive territory. Although demand from both home and overseas markets remains robust, manufacturers will have half an eye on what the MPC decides to do tomorrow and the potential impact an interest rate rise would have on sterling. They will also be looking ahead to the Autumn Statement and what that may bring by way of a boost for the sector and I suspect many will be looking for R&amp;D tax credits to feature and encourage a much needed increase in investment.\u201d Dennis de Jong, managing director at UFX.com \u201cThe Prime Minister will be pleased to see an above-expectations hike in manufacturing output in October, particularly after a bigger than expected fall the month prior. \u201cBritish business is still trying to balance Brexit uncertainty against a weak currency-led boost to exports, but with the sterling creeping upwards of late, foreign demand may not hold for long. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to say whether UK industry is out the woods just yet, with pressure on the sector likely to persist until more political clarity is found both domestically and on the continent. Shannon Murphy, assistant head of risk underwriting at Euler Hermes. \u201cWhile UK exports have increased in recent months, levels have yet to reach the heights that the devalued Sterling and strengthening economic performance in the Eurozone and global markets promised. Clearly, British manufacturers are prioritising profit margins over exports. \u201cThe lack of visibility over the future direction of Brexit negotiations is holding back major investment initiatives in the sector that might have boosted productivity. Without a clearer picture to support those decisions, there are concerns that UK manufacturing will fall behind in the global technology race and struggle to compete. \u201cInput costs continue to weigh down on margins and a possible uptick in the interest rate from the Bank of England will add further pressure. Businesses will need to be vigilant of a potential rise in financial risk.\u201d The UK manufacturing PMI report has pushed the pound over $1.33 for the first time in two weeks. Breaking! UK factories grew faster than expected last month, thanks to a surge in new orders. Data firm Markit reports that manufacturing output and new order growth remained robust in October, suggesting that the weak pound is helping factories. However, the fall in sterling is also pushing up the cost of raw materials, and finished products too. Markit says: The UK manufacturing sector started the final quarter of the year on a solid footing. Production and new order volumes continued to rise at robust rates, as companies benefited from strong domestic market conditions and rising inflows of new export business. Price pressures remained elevated, however, with rates of inflation in input costs and output charges both accelerating and staying well above historical series averages. This rise in output pushed the UK manufacturing PMI up to 56.3, which shows stronger growth. September\u2019s reading has been revised higher too. Rob Dobson, Director at IHS Markit, adds: \u201cUK manufacturing made an impressive start to the final quarter of 2017 as increased inflows of new work encouraged firms to ramp up production once again. Retail analyst Nick Bubb says the 7.7% slide in Next\u2019s high street sales over the last quarter is \u2018sickening\u2019. He writes: If such a distinguished guru as Simon Wolfson of Next finds it impossible to read the underlying sales trends, because of the volatility of the weather, then what are we mere mortals to do?... Some people in the City expected full-price sales to be nearly 4.5% up in Q3, driven by Next Directory, but the outcome was only +1.3%, with Next Retail down a sickening 7.7% and Next Directory up 13.2% Global Data retail analyst Patrick O\u2019Brien wonders whether Next\u2019s online ordering system can help: And here\u2019s BBC reporter Clodagh Rice: The stock market can be cruel at times. So says George Salmon, Equity Analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown: Next\u2019s third quarter performance is actually better than what we\u2019ve seen from the group so far this year, but with many expecting a much stronger showing, the shares still took a tumble. While the recent investment in digital marketing seems to have helped the Directory division rediscover its mojo, Next\u2019s high street stores saw an almighty slump this quarter. A particularly weak October means the group enters the all-important Christmas period with less momentum than it would have liked. Salmon add that other retailers could be nervous too... Shareholders in Marks &amp; Spencer, for example, might now be a bit more nervous ahead of next week\u2019s half year numbers. Connor Campbell of SpreadEX says it\u2019s turning into an \u201cugly, ugly morning for Next\u201d. He says recent positive noises from the company have \u201ccome back to haunt\u201d Next, as today\u2019s sales figures have punctured the optimism that had built up recently. Campbell adds: While Q3 total sales grew 1.3%, an improvement on the 2.2% decline seen in the first half of the year, that was lower than the 2.9% growth expected as the firm warned on the \u2018extremely volatile\u2019 sector landscape. Similarly, though Directory sales rocketed 13.2% higher, retail (i.e. high street) sales plunged a far worse than estimated 7.7%, leading Next to revise its annual pre-tax profit forecasts from \u00a3687m-\u00a3747m to \u00a3692m-\u00a3742m. None of these were particularly bad figures; but the expectation created by the past few updates meant these Q3 results couldn\u2019t help but disappoint, causing the stock to sink 7.5% to a 7 week nadir. Shares in Next have tumbled by almost 8% at the start of trading. They\u2019ve slumped to the bottom of the FTSE 100 leaderboard, down 368p at \u00a345.52. That confirms that the company\u2019s results are weaker than the City expected. Other retailers are also suffering, with Marks &amp; Spencer down 3.7% and Associated British Foods (which owns Primark) down 2.5%. UK high street retailer Next has spooked the City by missing its sales forecasts and warning that trading is \u201cextremely volatile\u201d. Next, one of the country\u2019s key retailers, has reported that sales at its stores shrank by 7.7% in the three months to 29th October. Although directory sales (including online) rose by 13.2%, this means Next\u2019s total full-price sales only increased by 1.3% over the quarter. Some analysts had expected growth of 4%, so this is a new signal that the UK high street could be weakening. Recent warm weather has hurt clothing retailers, as it has discouraged shoppers from splashing out on a new winter coat. Next says: Sales performance has remained extremely volatile and is highly dependent on the seasonality of the weather. In August and September sales were significantly up on last year, as cooler temperatures improved sales of warmer weight stock. The change in sales trend came at precisely the same time UK temperatures became warmer than last year. But there are also signs that rising inflation, which is outstripping wage growth, is hurting shoppers. Next admits that it\u2019s hard to see exactly what\u2019s going on out there: Week by week sales volatility makes it very hard to determine any underlying sales trend. We believe the most reliable guide to sales for the balance of the year are the full price sales for the year to date, which are down -0.3%. Despite the sales slowdown, Next is hoping to make pre-tax profits of \u00a3692m to \u00a3742m for this financial year. Reaction to follow.... Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. UK manufacturing has a surprisingly good summer, expanding by 1% during the third quarter of 2017 (according to last week\u2019s GDP report). Today we discover whether it maintained that momentum in October. That\u2019s because data firm Markit are releasing their latest purchasing managers reports, showing how factories around the world fared last month. Economists predict a solid reading from the UK, with its manufacturing PMI tipped to remain unchanged at 55.9. Konstantinos Anthis of ADS Securities believe the numbers could move the pound: Earlier in the day investors will want to pay attention to the Manufacturing PMI release from the UK which comes a day before tomorrow\u2019s Bank of England meeting on monetary policy. The pound has gained considerably over the past two days as expectations are set for the BoE to hike rates this month and today\u2019s PMI release could set the stage for more gains. Royal Bank of Canada say: There was a loss of momentum generally last month in many of the activity sub-components of these surveys but the manufacturing sector is looking the most buoyant. Alas, we\u2019ll have to wait until tomorrow to find how the eurozone\u2019s factories performed. Nationwide, the estate agent, has reported that house prices rose by 0.2% last month (more on that shortly). Over in America, the Federal Reserve is holding a policy meeting - but we\u2019re not expecting an interest rate rise. Here\u2019s the agenda: 9.30am GMT: UK manufacturing PMI for October 10am GMT: Bank of England deputy governors Jon Cunliffe and Sam Woods testify to the House of Lords EU financial affairs committee. They\u2019ll be discussing \u2018Financial regulation and supervision following Brexit\u2019 1.30pm GMT: Canada\u2019s manufacturing PMI for October 2pm GMT: US manufacturing PMI for October 6pm GMT: Federal Reserve interest rate decision",

On Thursday Donald Trump is expected to announce his pick for the new Fed chair, with the dovish Jerome Powell said to be the frontrunner to replace Janet Yellen. Although Yellen herself may not be completely out of the picture, the choice of Powell would suggest to investors that the Fed is likely to continue on its present course of gradual interest rate rises as the economic conditions dictate. Craig Erlam, senior market analyst at Oanda, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The Fed\u2019s monetary policy decision would typically be one of, if not the most important event of the week but that may not be the case today. For one, it\u2019s extremely unlikely that any change in interest rates will be announced, with December remaining far more likely for the final hike of the year. With Chair Janet Yellen not making an appearance after the announcement, we instead have to rely on the accompanying statement for clues as to whether another hike in December is still planned.</p> <p>Moreover, with Donald Trump poised to announce who will succeed Yellen from February on Thursday, investors may take the statement with a pinch of salt when considering interest rates beyond the end of the year. All things considered, not only is today\u2019s announcement not the biggest market event this week, it\u2019s unlikely to even be the most important Fed event.</p> <p>When it comes to the statement, I don\u2019t expect the central bank to deviate much, if at all, from previous rhetoric as the data has been broadly consistent with expectations, barring the understandable weak jobs report last month. This Friday\u2019s report is expected to be much better than normal which should mostly offset the weakness in job creation in September, something the Fed may allude to.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"388507310a25bc6ad9c6fe5d863520f7f716ee5d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/388507310a25bc6ad9c6fe5d863520f7f716ee5d/0_0_2000_1433/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jerome Powell\" width=\"1000\" height=\"717\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jerome Powell<br></span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andrew Harnik/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Josh Mahony, market analyst at IG Group, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Today\u2019s focus will no doubt fall on the Fed, with the penultimate FOMC meeting of the year happening just a day before Trump announces his pick for the Fed chair. With markets widely expecting to see Trump opt for Jerome Powell, there is no doubt that Janet Yellen will want to deliver the three rate hikes that were initially set out in the dot plot at the turn of the year. While today\u2019s meeting may not bring the kind of volatility and excitement of tomorrow\u2019s Bank of England announcement, today is a key determinant of market expectations as we seek to narrow down exactly how likely a rate hike is for December.</p> </blockquote> <p>Stefan Gerlach, chief economist at EPG Bank and former deputy governor of the Central Bank of Ireland, looks at the potential candidates for the Fed chair:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The first is Jerome Powell, who has served as a Fed Governor since 2012, and who is seen as the favourite.

As well as the reasonable manufacturing data, there were also some positive jobs numbers, ahead of Friday\u2019s official non-farm payroll numbers.</p> <p>The monthly ADP report showed private employers hired 235,000 workers in October, better than the 200,000 figures analysts had been expecting. It was also much better than September\u2019s 110,000 figure, albeit this was revised down from the initial estimate of a 135,000 increase. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It was a pretty strong afternoon for US data. The ADP non-farm employment change reading hit 235k, sharply higher than last month\u2019s 110k, to set up a potentially massive \u2018official\u2019 number on Friday, while the final Markit manufacturing PMI for October came in a tad higher than forecast at 54.6. Only the ISM manufacturing figure disappointed, and even then, at 58.7, it was a more than respectable number.</p> <p>The dollar was the main beneficiary of all this (the Dow Jones lost roughly a third of its early gains, though after rising 100 points it\u2019s still at a fresh all time high). The greenback reversed its initial losses against the pound to climb 0.1%-0.2%, sending cable back below $1.33, while against the euro it jumped 0.2%. This reaction was assumedly related to the hawkish-tinge of the day\u2019s data, with investors hoping the Federal Reserve tees up a December rate hike with this evening\u2019s statement.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-59f9ea5b69a70e05d9e48086\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/juliakollewe\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-11-01T15:45:28.089Z\">3.45pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Estate agent Jones Lang LaSalle has just published its latest forecasts for UK house price growth in the next five years.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "They are no longer legal tender, but shoppers will be able to continue using round pounds in hundreds of shops for at least another two months. Iceland, the food retailer, has announced it will accept payments in old \u00a31 coins until 31 December. It is not the only retailer to make such a commitment: toy shop chain The Entertainer, which has 140 stores, has said its cut-off point for spending the old coins is also New Year\u2019s Eve. Round pounds ceased to be legal tender at midnight on 15 October after the introduction this year of a 12-sided coin. Many retailers refused to accept the old ones after that date, but others said they would continue to take them for a further week or two. Iceland\u2019s original acceptance deadline was 31 October, but it will now take round pounds at all Iceland and The Food Warehouse stores until the end of the year. The retailer\u2019s move is notable as it has more than 890 stores in the UK. The decision may reflect the fact that, according to the Royal Mint on Wednesday, an estimated 400m to 450m old pounds are still in circulation, some of which will be in piggy banks, down the backs of sofas and in car glovebox compartments, despite the widely publicised deadline. Tarsem Dhaliwal, Iceland\u2019s group managing director, said: \u201cWe try to help our customers in any way we can, and the statistics tell us that very many people must still have old pound coins stashed away in their homes or cars. \u201cSo we are happy to save them the trouble of changing these old coins at a bank by allowing them to spend round pounds in our stores until the end of the year.\u201d However, it is not clear whether the Royal Mint entirely approves of such decisions. In what appeared to be a slightly brusque statement, it said: \u201cBusinesses told us they wanted certainty on a cut-off date for the old pound coin, which is why we introduced the October 15 deadline. \u201cWhile the majority of firms tell us they are ready, the small minority who choose to keep accepting the old coin will have to make their own arrangements with their banks.\u201d Some high street banks will take old \u00a31 coins as deposits into bank accounts, but they have different policies on how long they will continue do so and whether they will exchange old coins for new. The Royal Mint has said it is entirely up to individual banks. The new 12-sided, bi-metal coin came into circulation on 28 March as part of efforts to cut back on counterfeits. The old pound, which had been in circulation since 1983, was one of the most counterfeited coins in the world.",

In what appeared to be a slightly brusque statement, it said: \u201cBusinesses told us they wanted certainty on a cut-off date for the old pound coin, which is why we introduced the October 15 deadline. </p> <p>\u201cWhile the majority of firms tell us they are ready, the small minority who choose to keep accepting the old coin will have to make their own arrangements with their banks.\u201d<br></p> <p>Some high street banks will take old \u00a31 coins as deposits into bank accounts, but they have different policies on how long they will continue do so and whether they will exchange old coins for new.

      "bodyText": "UK house price growth edged up to a three-month high in October, but pressure on household budgets is weighing on the market according to Nationwide. Annual growth in house prices picked up to 2.5% from 2.3% in September, as a shortage of homes on the market and low mortgage rates propped up prices, the lender said in its monthly report. Prices rose 0.2% over the month, taking the average price of a UK home in October to \u00a3211,085. \u201cLow mortgage rates and healthy rates of employment growth are providing some support for demand, but this is being partly offset by pressure on household incomes, which appears to be weighing on confidence,\u201d said Robert Gardner, Nationwide\u2019s chief economist. \u201cThe lack of homes on the market is providing support to house prices.\u201d Variable rate mortgage holders could be in store for a rise in monthly payments if the Bank of England raises interest rates on Thursday for the first time in more than a decade. The Bank\u2019s Monetary Policy Committee is expected to raise rates to 0.5% from a current all-time low of 0.25%, putting further pressure on household budgets that are already stretched as prices rise faster than wages. Nationwide said earlier this week that a 0.25% interest rate rise would be passed on in full to its 600,000-plus variable-rate home loan customers. However, Gardner said that the proportion of UK borrowers directly impacted by a rate rise would be smaller than in the past, because the share of outstanding mortgages on variable rates was at a record low of 40%, compared with a peak of 70% in 2001. On an average mortgage, a 0.25-point increase in rates would have a modest impact for most borrowers on variable rates according to Nationwide, with monthly payments increasing by \u00a315 to \u00a3665. \u201cThat\u2019s not to say that the rise will be welcome news for many borrowers,\u201d Gardner said. \u201cHousehold budgets are under pressure from the fact that wages have not been rising as fast as the cost of living. Indeed, in real terms \u2013 after adjusting for inflation \u2013 wage rates are still at levels prevailing in 2005.\u201d Economists at the forecasting group EY Item Club said UK house price growth was likely to remain subdued for the remainder of 2017, and rise by about 2%-3% in 2018. Howard Archer, the group\u2019s chief economic adviser, said the housing market was likely to remain challenging over the coming months against a backdrop of falling real wages and fragile consumer confidence. \u201cIt is also very possible that a likely Bank of England interest rate hike on Thursday will weigh down on housing market activity,\u201d Archer added. \u201cWhile any increase in interest rates would be small and mortgage rates would still be at historically very low levels, the fact that it would be the first rise in interest rates since 2007 could have a significant effect on housing market psychology.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Jumbo trollies are on their way out, Britain now prefers blueberries to strawberries and sales of vegetarian ready-meals are on the rise, according to a new report on food shopping habits. Two-thirds of Britons now nip to a supermarket more than once a day, and one in 10 people decide what to buy for an evening meal just before they eat it \u2013 often stopping to shop for it on the way home from work. Longer opening hours and more convenience stores have combined with a drive among shoppers to waste less and stop themselves \u201cover-buying\u201d to a new trend called \u201cas and when shopping\u201d. The Waitrose Food and Drink Report 2017 says consumers treat supermarkets like walk-in fridges. Waitrose said the changes in the way we shop and eat are bringing some unexpected changes \u2013 like the trolley downsizing . The grocer says: \u201cJust a few years ago, an average Waitrose would open with around 200 big trolleys and 150 shallow \u2018daily shopper\u2019 trolleys lined up outside. These days the tables have turned, with 250 shallow \u2018daily shoppers\u2019 and just 70 big trolleys needed.\u201d The report, based on research among shoppers who use all supermarkets, not just Waitrose, also reveals the big eating and drinking trends of this year \u2013 and makes predictions for 2018. Turmeric has overtaken cinnamon as the top-selling spice, and for the first time blueberrries are outselling strawberries as the most popular berry. Shoppers are buying far more dark-leafed vegetables, with a pack of cavolo nero, chard or kale now sold at Waitrose every second. Sales of vegetarian prepared meals are up by 11% while other additions include celeriac \u201crice\u201d and beetroot spaghetti. Buddha bowls \u2013 usually greens, beans and a grain such as rice or quinoa \u2013 became mainstream this year, says the report, having started as an Instagram trend. Peanut butter is also becoming more popular, popping up in everything from ice cream to cereal, with sales climbing by 20% this year. Juniper berries \u2013 used to garnish gin and tonic or as an addition to savoury dishes \u2013 are also on the up, with recent sales up by 17%. In the drinks aisle, Waitrose singles out Sicilian wine, craft porters and Spanish vermouth as growing fast, along with premium mixers. Sales of the Fever Tree premium tonic brand have soared by 74% this year. The report also says consumers now steer clear of fussy cooking for formal dinner parties, and opt instead for sharing plates such as tapas or American-style \u201cbring a dish\u201d supper parties. As a break from the kitchen, three-quarters of Britons say dining out alone is more socially acceptable than it was five years ago. One in three people had eaten out solo in the last month and one in three 18- to 24-year-olds said their mobile phone was their dining companion. The Waitrose managing director, Rob Collins said: \u201cPeople have become more flexible in their shopping patterns, more price-savvy and more single-minded than ever before. There\u2019s no longer a stigma in buying \u2018reduced\u2019 food and and no longer a taboo in dining out alone. And there is no longer pressure to put on a fancy dinner party.\u201d The grocer\u2019s report is based on millions of transactions in shops and online, bolstered by a poll of 2,000 adults of all ages and supported by sessions with focus groups. It also forecasts the foods that will go mainstream in the next 12 months, and predicts that 2018 will be the year of Indian street food and Japanese \u201cdude food\u201d, which it describes as \u201cthe unctuous rich and surprising flavours of after-hours Tokyo\u201d. A fourth meal each day \u2013 especially healthy snacks or indulgent treats \u2013 is evidently also becoming more common. \u201cThis is not about gluttony, rather it is about adapting our eating schedules to our busy lives,\u201d the researchers said. When it comes to diet, a commonsense approach now rules; strict eating plans or cutting entire food groups have fallen out of favour and carbs \u2013 from bulgar wheat to versatile quinoa \u2013 are back on the menu. The Waitrose report, however, also says there are still foods where fussy British shoppers refuse to compromise, notably meat, chocolate, coffee and cheese \u2013 and toilet roll.",

And there is no longer pressure to put on a fancy dinner party.\u201d</p> <p>The grocer\u2019s report is based on millions of transactions in shops and online, bolstered by a poll of 2,000 adults of all ages and supported by sessions with focus groups.</p> <p>It also forecasts the foods that will go mainstream in the next 12 months, and predicts that 2018 will be the year of Indian street food and Japanese \u201cdude food\u201d, which it describes as \u201cthe unctuous rich and surprising flavours of after-hours Tokyo\u201d.</p> <p>A fourth meal each day \u2013 especially healthy snacks or indulgent treats \u2013 is evidently also becoming more common. \u201cThis is not about gluttony, rather it is about adapting our eating schedules to our busy lives,\u201d the researchers said.</p> <p>When it comes to diet, a commonsense approach now rules; strict eating plans or cutting entire food groups have fallen out of favour and carbs \u2013 from bulgar wheat to versatile quinoa \u2013 are back on the menu.<br></p> <p>The Waitrose report, however, also says there are still foods where fussy British shoppers refuse to compromise, notably meat, chocolate, coffee and cheese \u2013 and toilet roll. </p> <p> </p>",
