      "bodyText": "The Turnbull government appears in a hurry to get to an election, and as ever the economy will be a major part, but what will be front and centre? The budget Ironically, given talk of an early budget is behind much of the election speculation, the budget bottom line won\u2019t itself be a massive issue. Sure there\u2019ll be talk of debt and deficit and the usual \u201cneed to live within our means\u201d idiocy, but it\u2019s hard to see the government going big on debt given under their watch it has continued to grow: The rush to surplus is tough when revenue doesn\u2019t grow faster than you expect. And historically, you also need revenue to be growing by over 7% each year \u2013 something we\u2019re not expecting to see until 2018-19: The recent increases in iron ore prices may help things a little, but given the sharp falls in the past couple days you wouldn\u2019t want to bet on it \u2013 especially as major mining companies such as BHP have struggled mightily this year. That means the only way to cut debt and get back to surplus is through very sharp spending cuts \u2013 something that would be tough to sell without evoking memories of Hockey 2014. Taxes The budget bottom line might not be a big issue, but taxation will be. Obviously the GST change is gone, but the government looks likely to introduce some superannuation changes, but just how big they will be is open to question, especially given they have stepped away from anything major thus far. But if they are going to cut spending on services such as dental care and welfare, then they also need to be seen to hit the wealthy, and super is the most obvious place to do so. Scott Morrison has also talked at various volume levels about income tax cuts to alleviate bracket creep. Such a move might see the ALP need to counter, but as any tax cuts will likely be funded by spending cuts elsewhere, the ALP will likely not mimic in that manner. The ALP will also run hard on multinational tax avoidance. They will likely overplay the amount of revenue that can be garnered but as the US Presidential election has shown, suggesting multinationals haven\u2019t been playing fair is a winning proposition. Housing affordability Of course the big tax debate at the moment is over negative gearing and capital gains tax changes. Fortunately the Liberal party has taken the mature, rational approach, such as when Peter Dutton suggested that the ALP\u2019s policy would mean \u201cthe economy will come to a shuddering halt\u201d and \u201cthe stock market will crash\u201d. But back on planet earth, the issue is all about housing affordability. It\u2019s clear the Liberal party will run hard on its scare campaign \u2013 having gone all in, it can\u2019t stop now \u2013 but it will also need to talk about what it can do to improve the ability for first-time home buyer to get into the market. It will likely try to put a cap on the amount individuals can claim on negative gearing, but that policy seems more about shifting who benefits from negative gearing rather than actually doing anything about housing affordability. There are a number of ways to measure housing affordability, but one I like compares the average size of a home loan to average full-time income. On this measure there has been a sharp increase in the past 3 years: And while the Prime Minister is correct to surmise that people do worry about the value of their home, they also worry about the ability of their kids to be able to buy one as well, and right now first home buyers are almost at record low levels: Infrastructure As soon as you talk housing, you also need to talk infrastructure \u2013 roads, bridges, rail \u2013 to not only deal with congestion but also to improve productivity. Malcolm Turnbull is already on the issue with his speech last Friday on the need for rail links to the new Badgerys Creek airport. The election will see the usual infrastructure promises. But will political parties limit themselves to the confines of the budget deficit parameters? Or will any be brave enough to note governments can now borrow at record low interest rates, and maybe it is time to make use of them? And can anyone make an announcement without sounding like it is from a script of Utopia? Job, jobs, jobs The talk of infrastructure will also be about jobs, which in the end is pretty much the main economic game come election time. Sure people might get a bit excited about debt and deficit, but mostly the economy means jobs \u2013 is my job secure, and for parents, whether their children be able to get a decent job when they leave school. This latter issue is mostly under the surface at the moment \u2013 and certainly not as front and centre as it currently is in the US presidential election \u2013 perhaps because places like Whyalla don\u2019t have the population of Detroit. One problem for the campaign is that employment growth around the country is quite wildly spread. In NSW it\u2019s going great; Queensland is on the rise, and Victoria, while doing okay, is not doing as well as it was 12 months ago, and it\u2019s awful in South Australia and Western Australia: This situation is exaggerated with full-time work \u2013 NSW is doing well; the rest of the nation, not: And this relative weakness in full-time employment growth around the country also has seen increases in the level of workers who are underemployed. There is a higher percentage of workers underemployed in each state than there was at the last election \u2013 most pointedly in South Australia and Western Australia: So while the employment is doing okay \u2013 and the unemployment rate is basically where it was in 2013 \u2013 jobs will remain an issue because there are enough signs that we are nowhere near full capacity. There\u2019s still plenty of people looking for work and looking for more work. Pay and conditions And those who do have work certainly are not seeing any sort of pay growth: New South Wales, which is having the best employment growth, has one of the worst wages growth in the country. And this is where the big issue of the election campaign will be \u2013 especially from the ALP side \u2013 wages and conditions. If Turnbull calls a double dissolution on the Registered Organisations Bill and the Australian Building and Construction Commission legislation then industrial relations is forced into the spotlight in a very central manner. Voters might not be fully across the two issues, but they certainly are across pay and penalty rates. WorkChoices died a miserable death when the unemployment rate was at 4.3%, compared to the current level of 6%, and wages were rising at 4.0% compared to the current rate of 2.0%. The economy is already undergoing massive changes due to the end of the mining boom. Arguing we need more change to an IR system which has shown ample flexibility and at a time where workers\u2019 standard of living is falling would require a level of salesmanship I have yet to see from this government. Throw in climate change via the ALP\u2019s emissions trading scheme and you probably have the economic debate covered. It\u2019s a fairly unwieldy mess. No one state looks much like another, and political parties need to promise better times in a period when the entire world is experiencing slow growth.",

The Pensions Regulator (TPR) is understood to be considering whether to order Green to pay \u00a3280m of the \u00a3300m it would cost the \u201clifeboat\u201d Pension Protection Fund (PPF) to make good the gap if it is called upon to take the scheme on.

Those receiving a pension because of ill health or one linked to a deceased relative will also not be affected. Green could fight any such order.

      "bodyText": "Advertising company WPP will reveal this week that its chief executive, Sir Martin Sorrell, has been handed shares worth \u00a360m in a move that will take the total earnings of the high-profile FTSE 100 boss to more than \u00a3150m in five years. Sorrell\u2019s pay deal for 2015 is likely to reach close to \u00a370m once his salary and annual bonuses are added to the long-term bonus scheme which will be announced this week. His pay \u2013 a past flashpoint with investors \u2013 is being revealed at the start of the AGM season for the UK\u2019s stock market-listed companies when themes such as generous pay rises, over-stretched directors and boardroom succession planning are expected to become major talking points. In 2015, Sorrell\u2019s \u00a31.1m salary will be bolstered by the release of shares from a long-term bonus scheme which dates back to 2011. That scheme will be phased out next year following a shareholder rebellion in 2012, when nearly 60% investors voted against the deal. The company confirmed this week it would announce that from 2011 to 2015 WPP had outperformed its peers and the FTSE 100. This appears to indicate that around 3.5m shares \u2013 each worth more than \u00a315 \u2013 will be released to him, along with shares to cover forgone dividends which could push the bonus up to \u00a360m. Sorrell was paid \u00a343m in 2014 and information contained in the annual report for that year would indicate his pay deal for 2015 will push his total earnings since 2010 to more than \u00a3150m. His biggest payday until now was in 2004 when he received \u00a353m. Sorrell\u2019s total pay deal comes as investors prepare for the annual general meeting season when investors have already put companies on notice about the topics likely to prompt rebellions this year. A leading shareholder advisory service, ISS, has already put companies on notice that it is looking at the topic of directors who carry out a large number of roles. \u201cISS may recommend against \u2018overboarded\u2019 directors,\u201d the advisory service said. Andrew Ninian, director of corporate governance at the Investment Association, said: \u201cThe overall theme of board effectiveness isn\u2019t going away. Investors will be looking at annual reports to see how their governance is working.\u201d However, he added: \u201cPredominantly, the [main issue] will be about pay.\u201d AGMs are the one time when small private investors and major investors with multimillion-pound stakes are able to air concerns about how companies are run. They get to vote on a number of issues such as the emuneration report and the election of directors to the board. The high street banks have already published their annual reports for 2015 and will be facing scrutiny from investors about whether bonus pools to staff reflect the dividend payments to shareholders. Other issues include succession planning. For instance, Schroders has attracted interest for its succession planning, after promoting Michael Dobson to chairman after 14 years as chief executive. Corporate governance codes require an explanation for such a move as it could stifle the ability of the new CEO to run the company.",

    "webTitle": "Budget 2016: is George Osborne asleep at the wheel of UK's economy?", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Jeremy Corbyn has one of the hardest gigs in politics coming up on Wednesday. By tradition the response to the budget comes not from the shadow chancellor but from the leader of the opposition, who has the unenviable task of responding to a package of measures he has not seen and which invariably contains one or two big surprises. The surprise this time could be some modest tax cuts. George Osborne likes nothing better than to set traps for his political opponents, so Corbyn should be alive to the possibility that the budget will not be nearly as grim an affair as its advance billing has indicated. The scene has certainly been set, with the chancellor using his appearance on the Andrew Marr show to move all his props into place: a weakening global economy; a black hole in the public finances; the need for the government to save an additional 50p for every \u00a3100 it spends. But just as those attending West End shows are well advised not to read too much into the notices that say \u201cstunning\u201d or \u201cextraordinary\u201d plastered outside the theatre, experience shows that budgets don\u2019t always live up to their advance billing. Osborne\u2019s eighth budget is not going to be the equivalent of Hamlet or the Duchess of Malfi, with corpses littering the stage in the final act. There are both political and economic reasons for this. The political constraint on a severely austere budget is obvious: the referendum on whether Britain should remain part of the EU is fast approaching and Osborne wants to keep as many voters sweet as possible. He has already mothballed plans to make tax relief on pensions less generous for the better off. In past budgets, Osborne\u2019s method has been simple: announce high-profile tax cuts paid for by stealth taxes. There seems no obvious reason for him to deviate from this formula on Wednesday, so expect a fresh crackdown on tax avoidance to pay for increases in income tax allowances. The build-up to the 2015 autumn atatement was also unpromising for the chancellor, because he was under pressure to U-turn on tax credits without adding to the spending cuts planned for Whitehall departments. On that occasion, the Office for Budget Responsibility came to the rescue by increasing its estimate of tax revenues by \u00a327bn for the rest of the parliament. That allowed Osborne to soften his planned spending cuts, scrap the tax credit changes and still pencil in a \u00a310bn surplus on the public finances by 2019-20. Three months on, the government\u2019s financial position looks a lot less rosy. Back in November, the OBR expected the economy to be 3.6% bigger in 2015 than it had been in 2014 but it has since revised down the growth to 2.6%. That shortfall of one percentage point translates into an economy that is \u00a318bn smaller than expected. With inflation lower, wages growing more slowly than predicted and the global outlook darker, the OBR will announce on Wednesday that it has cut its 2016 growth forecast. The economy is going to expand less rapidly and from a lower starting point, with knock-on consequences for the exchequer in the form of lower tax receipts. It is not all bad news, though. Lower inflation means that interest rates will stay lower for longer than previously expected, and this means it will be cheaper for the government to finance its borrowing. Lower debt interest payments will help mitigate the impact of less bountiful tax receipts. Osborne spelled out what this meant on Marr. The government, he said, would need to save an additional 50p for every \u00a3100 it spent by the end of the decade. This is the equivalent of \u00a34bn. The chancellor\u2019s comments were, however, carefully phrased. He is not intending to make \u00a34bn of immediate spending cuts but will pencil them in for later in the parliament and achieve them through higher efficiency. Fiscal policy \u2013 the mix of tax and spending \u2013 is already taking money out of the economy and Osborne will not want to increase the pain when growth is already fragile. Personally, the chancellor is more exposed than at any time since the so-called \u201comnishambles\u201d budget of 2012. He was in his pomp at the time of last summer\u2019s post-election budget but has been on the defensive ever since, first over his changes to tax credits and more recently over the slowdown in the economy. It is always a sign that things are not going too well at the Treasury when chancellors start to cite the global economy as the cause of their problems. There is an iron law in British politics: the chancellor claims all the credit in the good times, but when things go wrong somebody else is to blame. It is only three months since Osborne\u2019s autumn statement and spending review: his argument that the world is suddenly a more \u201cdifficult and dangerous\u201d place is unconvincing. The chancellor\u2019s line, repeated endlessly in his seven previous budgets, is that he has been doing what Labour failed to do: mend the roof while the sun is shining. If that was true, the economy ought to be able to withstand weaker Chinese growth, wobbles in the financial markets and the continued sluggishness of the eurozone. The world economy is slowing not crashing, and it doesn\u2019t say much for the quality of the chancellor\u2019s repair job that the rain has started to come in. The truth is that the failure of Osborne to hit his own budgetary targets is only tangentially related to the global economy. Indeed, it is worth noting that the drop in oil prices from $115 a barrel to $40 a barrel would, in past cycles, have led to faster not slower growth. The chancellor identified the real cause of the problem when he announced plans for his \u201c national living wage\u201d (in reality a beefed-up minimum wage) in last summer\u2019s budget: Britain\u2019s recent growth has been heavily biased towards low-productivity jobs that do not pay very well. Businesses would rather employ cheap labour rather than spend more on new kit, which explains why investment as a share of GDP is still well below where it was before the recession. Higher investment is the bedrock of a more successful economy. It boosts productivity, leading to higher wages, a bigger tax take and a smaller deficit. All this provides an opening for Corbyn. The budget will not be all that tough. It will contain some surface glitter: modest tax cuts and some extra money for some of the chancellor\u2019s pet projects, which this time seem to include robot-driven vehicles. The chancellor who has been asleep at the wheel is backing driverless cars. There is a joke in that somewhere.",

      "body": "<p>Jeremy Corbyn has one of the hardest gigs in politics coming up on Wednesday. By tradition the response to the budget comes not from the shadow chancellor but from the leader of the opposition, who has the unenviable task of responding to a package of measures he has not seen and which invariably contains one or two big surprises.</p> <p>The surprise this time could be some modest tax cuts. George Osborne likes nothing better than to set traps for his political opponents, so Corbyn should be alive to the possibility that the budget will not be nearly as grim an affair as its advance billing has indicated.</p> <p>The scene has certainly been set, with <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/b0744sfs/the-andrew-marr-show-13032016\">the chancellor using his appearance on the Andrew Marr show </a>to move all his props into place: a weakening global economy; a black hole in the public finances; the need for the government to save an additional 50p for every \u00a3100 it spends.</p> <p> But just as those attending West End shows are well advised not to read too much into the notices that say \u201cstunning\u201d or \u201cextraordinary\u201d plastered outside the theatre, experience shows that budgets don\u2019t always live up to their advance billing. Osborne\u2019s eighth budget is not going to be the equivalent of Hamlet or the Duchess of Malfi, with corpses littering the stage in the final act.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/mar/13/george-osbornes-november-pledges-how-far-has-he-got\">George Osborne's November pledges: how far has he got?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>There are both political and economic reasons for this. The political constraint on a severely austere budget is obvious: the referendum on whether Britain should remain part of the EU is fast approaching and Osborne wants to keep as many voters sweet as possible. He has already <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/2016/mar/04/george-osborne-backs-down-on-radical-pension-reform\">mothballed plans to make tax relief on pensions less generous </a>for the better off.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>In past budgets, Osborne\u2019s method has been simple: announce high-profile tax cuts paid for by stealth taxes. There seems no obvious reason for him to deviate from this formula on Wednesday, so expect a fresh crackdown on tax avoidance to pay for increases in income tax allowances.</p> <p>The build-up to the 2015 <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/autumn-statement-2015\">autumn atatement</a><a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/topical-events/autumn-statement-and-spending-review-2015\"> </a>was also unpromising for the chancellor, because he was under pressure to U-turn on tax credits without adding to the spending cuts planned for Whitehall departments. On that occasion, <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://budgetresponsibility.org.uk/economic-fiscal-outlook-november-2015-3/\">the Office for Budget Responsibility came to the rescue </a>by increasing its estimate of tax revenues by \u00a327bn for the rest of the parliament. That allowed Osborne to soften his planned spending cuts, scrap the tax credit changes and still pencil in a \u00a310bn surplus on the public finances by 2019-20.</p> <p>Three months on, the government\u2019s financial position looks a lot less rosy. Back in November, the OBR expected the economy to be 3.6% bigger in 2015 than it had been in 2014 but it has since revised down the growth to 2.6%. That shortfall of one percentage point translates into an economy that is \u00a318bn smaller than expected.</p> <p>With inflation lower, wages growing more slowly than predicted and the global outlook darker, the OBR will announce on Wednesday that it has cut its 2016 growth forecast. The economy is going to expand less rapidly and from a lower starting point, with knock-on consequences for the exchequer in the form of lower tax receipts. It is not all bad news, though. Lower inflation means that interest rates will stay lower for longer than previously expected, and this means it will be cheaper for the government to finance its borrowing. Lower debt interest payments will help mitigate the impact of less bountiful tax receipts.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Osborne spelled out what this meant on Marr. The government, he said, would need to save an additional 50p for every \u00a3100 it spent by the end of the decade. This is the equivalent of \u00a34bn.</p> <p>The chancellor\u2019s comments were, however, carefully phrased. He is not intending to make \u00a34bn of immediate spending cuts but will pencil them in for later in the parliament and achieve them through higher efficiency. Fiscal policy \u2013 the mix of tax and spending \u2013 is already taking money out of the economy and Osborne will not want to increase the pain when growth is already fragile.</p> <p>Personally, the chancellor is more exposed than at any time since the so-called <a href=\"http://www.standard.co.uk/news/politics/david-cameron-blasted-over-budget-omnishambles-7661054.html\">\u201comnishambles\u201d budget of 2012</a>. He was in his pomp at the time of last summer\u2019s post-election budget but has been on the defensive ever since, first over his changes to tax credits and more recently over the slowdown in the economy.</p> <p>It is always a sign that things are not going too well at the Treasury when chancellors start to cite the global economy as the cause of their problems. There is an iron law in British politics: the chancellor claims all the credit in the good times, but when things go wrong somebody else is to blame. It is only three months since Osborne\u2019s autumn statement and spending review: his argument that the world is suddenly a more \u201cdifficult and dangerous\u201d place is unconvincing.</p> <p>The chancellor\u2019s line, repeated endlessly in his seven previous budgets, is that he has been doing what Labour failed to do: mend the roof while the sun is shining. If that was true, the economy ought to be able to withstand weaker Chinese growth, wobbles in the financial markets and the continued sluggishness of the eurozone.

Unite, which has been campaigning with others against what it regards as serious threats to the NHS from the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) deal between Europe and the US, is now calling on Brussels to state that the UK\u2019s health service would be exempt from the potential impact of the deal. The union, and others on the left, are deeply concerned that the deal would make privatisation of elements of the NHS irreversible for future governments and allow private companies with links to NHS contracts to win higher levels of compensation through bypassing domestic courts. Controversy over TTIP has also threatened to become a leftwing rallying point in the referendum on Britain\u2019s membership of the EU. While the Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, has committed to supporting a vote for the UK to remain in the EU, he has strongly criticised TTIP, saying it risks \u201csigning away\u201d public services. Joseph Stiglitz, the Nobel Prize-winning economist recruited by the shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, to advise the Labour party, earlier this month went as far as saying the UK could be better off leaving the EU if TTIP was signed. Unite has now sent Cecilia Malmstr\u00f6m, European trade commissioner, a legal analysis detailing what it regards as potential threats to the NHS from TTIP. The union\u2019s assistant general secretary, Gail Cartmail, said: \u201cGiven the importance of the NHS and the fierce debate taking place in the UK over the European Union, you would expect the EU commissioner for trade to act without delay to allay our concerns over the impact of TTIP on the NHS. \u201cIt is time for Cecilia Malmstr\u00f6m to make clear that the UK government can act to exempt the NHS from TTIP without opposition from the commission.

She added: \u201cThe government has always been clear that protecting the NHS is of the utmost importance for the UK and will not be compromised for gains in any other part of the TTIP deal. We believe, as does the European commission, that provisions in the current TTIP texts and previous trade deals achieve this protection.\u201d Malmstr\u00f6m, who met US trade representative Michael Froman in Washington last week to review the status of TTIP talks, has claimed there have been \u201cmisconceptions\u201d circulating about TTIP and the NHS. In a letter last year to the UK\u2019s then trade minister, Ian Livingston, she insisted that EU member states do not have to open public health services to competition from private providers, or outsource services to private providers.

      "bodyText": "Snuggled up in bed, Yasser Khattak wanted to turn off the light without getting up. It was his lightbulb moment. That teenage frustration gave him the idea for a household plug socket and light switch where the on-off button is flicked remotely via a smartphone,so appliances such as TVs and lights can all be switched off at once, saving power. \u201cI was in bed one day reading my book, tucked away and I didn\u2019t want to get up to turn off the light switch. My dad, every day, would send me or my sister or my brothers around the house to turn off all the lights and appliances. Big house, it takes some time. It took us a few minutes. It was just inefficient,\u201d he says. \u201c[I thought] there should be a button \u2026 when the house is being built to hardwire everything into it so that before you go to bed it turns everything off. Before you go to work in the morning, it just turns everything off.\u201d The new range of products from Khattak\u2019s company Den is expected to launch early next year and include motion sensors so lights turn on automatically, for instance when someone gets up to go to the toilet at night. A remote control can also be used to switch off everything in a home at once. He claims his technology will recognise what type of appliance is plugged into a socket at any one time: for example, an iron left on can be switched off remotely. Khattak, now 20, developed the idea of having a remotely operated \u201crocker switch\u201d while at school. He says: \u201c[Switches] have been around for a really long time, for 100 years. There is just a better way to do it.\u201d Although almost identical to a conventional plug socket, the switch simply clicks on and off when a remote button is pressed. The remote control works within a radius of about 20 metres while the app communicates via a Wi-Fi hub which then relays commands to the switches. Engineers designed just how the switch moves from on to off \u2013 a feature which Khattak refuses to detail. \u201cI never studied engineering. I understand things from the user\u2019s point of view. I understand how it should look, how people should feel when they interact with it. That is where I look at things, I look from the user experience. So I will say, \u2018We need it to turn off when the iron is left on for more than half an hour\u2019 \u2013 that\u2019s how the user will see it and then we will talk to the team in terms of the software and electronics.\u201d The size of the final product will be identical to a run-of-the-mill plug socket, he says. Alongside the energy-saving potential and the convenience of remote control, Khattak says the system will help others, such as elderly people who will not have to reach behind the television to turn the TV set off at source or as a safety tool for children who go to the toilet at night. \u201cIf a smoke alarm detects smoke in the middle of the night, instead of a family having to run out in complete darkness, it can turn on your lights for you so people can see where they are going,\u201d he says. \u201cIf you leave your iron on or your hair straighteners on for more than half an hour we can send you a notification to say that something is not right.\u201d This ability to understand what appliance is plugged into a socket is another key feature, says Khattak. \u201cIf we detect that something has been plugged in on standby \u2013 like if there is a phone charger plugged in but there is no phone plugged in \u2013 it will automatically flick itself off after half an hour to save electricity. If you want your child\u2019s Xbox to not be powered after 10pm, we can set it to stop giving power after 10pm regardless of which plug they try and plug it into.\u201d While there are other smart lighting and switch systems on the market, Khattak claims they are too complicated. Early suggested prices for Den devices put a plug socket at \u00a39.99, a light switch at \u00a38.99 and a Wi-Fi hub to control them at \u00a359.99, although he says the final cost has not yet been determined. He aims to set them at the same cost as conventional plug sockets. The company raised almost \u00a3500,000 on a crowdfunding campaign last year and is now a team of six people. \u201cWe have retained what people are familiar with. The whole idea is that if someone moves into a house with our switches preinstalled, they would look at our products and instantly understand how to use them. As far as they are concerned, it is a normal switch which you just continue flicking on and off with your hand in the exact same way that you have always been able to,\u201d he says. \u2022 You can read our archive of The innovators columns on the Big Innovation Centre website where you will find more information on how Big Innovation Centre supports innovative enterprise in Britain and globally.",

      "body": "<p>Snuggled up in bed, Yasser Khattak wanted to turn off the light without getting up. It was his lightbulb moment. </p> <p>That teenage frustration gave him the idea for a household plug socket and light switch where the on-off button is flicked remotely via a smartphone,so appliances such as TVs and lights can all be switched off at once, saving power. </p> <p>\u201cI was in bed one day reading my book, tucked away and I didn\u2019t want to get up to turn off the light switch. My dad, every day, would send me or my sister or my brothers around the house to turn off all the lights and appliances. Big house, it takes some time. It took us a few minutes. It was just inefficient,\u201d he says.<br></p> <p>\u201c[I thought] there should be a button \u2026 when the house is being built to hardwire everything into it so that before you go to bed it turns everything off. Before you go to work in the morning, it just turns everything off.\u201d<br></p> <p>The new range of products from Khattak\u2019s company <a href=\"http://getden.co.uk/\">Den</a> is expected to launch early next year and include motion sensors so lights turn on automatically, for instance when someone gets up to go to the toilet at night. A remote control can also be used to switch off everything in a home at once. He claims his technology will recognise what type of appliance is plugged into a socket at any one time: for example, an iron left on can be switched off remotely.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/feb/28/the-innovators-platform-car-thats-driving-open-source-design\">The innovators: Skeleton car that is driving open-source design</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Khattak, now 20, developed the idea of having a remotely operated \u201crocker switch\u201d while at school. He says: \u201c[Switches] have been around for a really long time, for 100 years. There is just a better way to do it.\u201d<br></p> <p>Although almost identical to a conventional plug socket, the switch simply clicks on and off when a remote button is pressed. The remote control works within a radius of about 20 metres while the app communicates via a Wi-Fi hub which then relays commands to the switches. <br></p> <p>Engineers designed just how the switch moves from on to off \u2013 a feature which Khattak refuses to detail. \u201cI never studied engineering. I understand things from the user\u2019s point of view. I understand how it should look, how people should feel when they interact with it. That is where I look at things, I look from the user experience. So I will say, \u2018We need it to turn off when the iron is left on for more than half an hour\u2019 \u2013 that\u2019s how the user will see it and then we will talk to the team in terms of the software and electronics.\u201d The size of the final product will be identical to a run-of-the-mill plug socket, he says.<br></p> <p>Alongside the energy-saving potential and the convenience of remote control, Khattak says the system will help others, such as elderly people who will not have to reach behind the television to turn the TV set off at source or as a safety tool for children who go to the toilet at night. \u201cIf a smoke alarm detects smoke in the middle of the night, instead of a family having to run out in complete darkness, it can turn on your lights for you so people can see where they are going,\u201d he says. \u201cIf you leave your iron on or your hair straighteners on for more than half an hour we can send you a notification to say that something is not right.\u201d<br></p> <p>This ability to understand what appliance is plugged into a socket is another key feature, says Khattak. <br></p> <p>\u201cIf we detect that something has been plugged in on standby \u2013 like if there is a phone charger plugged in but there is no phone plugged in \u2013 it will automatically flick itself off after half an hour to save electricity. If you want your child\u2019s Xbox to not be powered after 10pm, we can set it to stop giving power after 10pm regardless of which plug they try and plug it into.\u201d <br></p> <p>While there are other <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/jun/09/old-house-smart-home\">smart lighting and switch systems</a> on the market, Khattak claims they are too complicated. <a href=\"https://www.seedrs.com/den2\">Early suggested prices</a> for Den devices put a plug socket at \u00a39.99, a light switch at \u00a38.99 and a Wi-Fi hub to control them at \u00a359.99, although he says the final cost has not yet been determined. He aims to set them at the same cost as conventional plug sockets. The company raised almost \u00a3500,000 on a crowdfunding campaign last year and is now a team of six people.<br></p> <p>\u201cWe have retained what people are familiar with. The whole idea is that if someone moves into a house with our switches preinstalled, they would look at our products and instantly understand how to use them. As far as they are concerned, it is a normal switch which you just continue flicking on and off with your hand in the exact same way that you have always been able to,\u201d he says.<br></p> <p>\u2022 You can read our archive of The innovators columns <a href=\"http://www.biginnovationcentre.com/the-innovators-column\">on the Big Innovation Centre website</a> where you will find more information on how Big Innovation Centre supports innovative enterprise in Britain and globally.</p> <p><br></p>",

      "bodyText": "Abracadabra! \u201cJean genie Lidl magics up \u00a35.99 denims,\u201d shouted the headline in a newspaper last weekend as it extolled the brilliance of the cut-price supermarket chain in once again undercutting its rivals. The German retailer, it explained, was continuing its assault on the traditional supermarket giants by targeting the high street fashion-conscious with jeans selling for an astonishing \u00a312 less than a similar pair in Tesco. How could these retail wizards do it? The unchallenged line from Lidl was that its huge buying power was the answer. It was just good at doing deals. But let us be clear. This is not magic. It is not Harry Potter making these jeans, it is a young woman in a factory in Bangladesh and one of the main reasons they are so cheap is that workers like her are paid as little as 2p for every pair they make. Still, \u00a35.99 is quite an achievement when even Primark \u2013 no slouches in the cost-cutting field \u2013 have only managed to get their lowest price down to \u00a38. So how do they do it? \u201cLidl surprises\u201d is the slogan the supermarket currently uses to punningly flog its wares, but it is no surprise to discover that the firm, like many of the British high street retailers, does much of its clothes shopping in Bangladesh, where the minimum legal wage for a garment worker is 23p an hour. Sure enough, when the new range launched on Thursday morning at Lidl\u2019s more than 600 UK stores as part of the \u201cWe Love Denim\u201d promotion \u2013 the word \u201clove\u201d denoted by a denim heart \u2013 the labels revealed Bangladesh as the source of the jeans. In a range of sizes and colours, they are dumped higgledy-piggledy in wire baskets at the rear of the store, but even Lidl\u2019s most ardent fans would probably concede that no one seeks out the stores for a retail therapy experience, so there are a few pennies saved on display costs for starters. The headline-grabbing \u00a35.99 offering is actually a pair of \u201cjeggings\u201d \u2013 tight-fitting leggings that resemble jeans. The label says they have a \u201cstylish denim effect\u201d. Cotton-rich fabric (77%), with an elasticated waistband; they have a single button, a YKK zip, two back pockets and two at the front, held together with stitching, no rivets. There is no embroidery on the pockets. This is all important. Every additional detail adds to the price of the finished item. A breakdown of costs at a Bangladeshi jeans factory published by Bloomberg in 2013 priced a zip at 10p, a button at 4p and rivets at 1p each. Embroidery added another 9p, the pockets 6p and the labels 7p. At these margins, every single penny counts, so it is no surprise to find that the jeggings are pared back to the bone. But the Boyfriend Jeans, at \u00a37.99, appear to be the real thing: four pockets plus that baffling little one inside the front pocket on the right of the body (it is a watch pocket, apparently). There are six belt loops, five rivets, three buttons and a YKK zip. And they are made from 100% cotton, the material being the most expensive element of the production process: in the range of \u00a32.30 to \u00a32.50. There is thread to pay for too, for the stitching, which might be as much as 19p, and the finished pair will need to be washed, so if we are going to try to put a price on the materials we are probably looking around the \u00a33.90 mark. Now we need to assemble those materials. Luckily \u2013 for the buyer \u2013 that is not nearly as expensive. Most of the workers in Bangladeshi garment factories are women and most are paid at the minimum legal wage of 5,300 takas a month (about \u00a348). That is 23p an hour on an eight-hour, six-day, week. It is a fifth of the \u00a3230 a month estimated by the Asia Floor Wage Alliance to be the minimum required for a living wage back in 2013. To accurately work out the labour cost, you need to know how many pairs of jeans the factory turns out a day. The available figures cover quite a broad range: research in India found workers in one factory averaging 20 pairs a day, while a different study in Tunisia found 33 pairs a day. It all depends on the quality and complexity of the design. In 2010 the Institute for Global Labour and Human Rights looked at Bangladesh and found a team of 25 workers turning out 250 pairs of jeans an hour \u2013 10 per worker, or 80 per worker per day. That means a minimum wage worker would be paid somewhere in a range between 2p and 9p for each pair of jeans they make, which is broadly in line with a 2011 study of Bangladeshi garment manufacture by the US consultancy O\u2019Rourke Group Partners, which priced the labour costs for a polo shirt at 8p. O\u2019Rourke put the total factory costs per shirt at 41p: Bloomberg calculated its Bangladeshi jeans cost the factory 56p to make, and the factory added on 16p in profit. Splitting the difference, we are now up to about \u00a34.50. But we still need to ship the jeans, and there are warehouse charges and port fees, so we can stick on another 30p, taking us up to \u00a34.80. And we still need to get them from the port to the store, so that\u2019s another 50p. That gives us \u00a35.30, but there is still VAT to go on top. The grand total of \u00a36.36 would bust the budget for the jeggings, but they use a little less material, and we have saved a few pennies on the buttons and rivets. That will make them quicker to turn out, so that is a bit off the labour costs. It might just about be possible to bring them in at \u00a35.99 or they may be a loss leader: that happens. The jeans, meanwhile, are showing a profit of \u00a31.63. But this is where Lidl\u2019s purchasing power has to kick in, because both the jeggings and the jeans are imported by middlemen, who sell on to the supermarket \u2013 respectively OWIM Gmbh, a German company, and Hong Kong-based Top Grade International Enterprise Ltd, which exports 30 million pieces a year from Bangladesh. Both need to take their cut. In the Bloomberg example, the middleman took a cut of \u00a32. That is clearly out of the question here if Lidl is to turn a profit itself. And that is the reality of a \u00a35.99 pair of jeans: everyone is squeezed, all down the line. Times are tough. Customers demand the cheapest possible clothes. Lidl\u2019s success is built on this: that is how it racked up \u00a34bn of sales in 2014. It meets a need and it does so by putting the tightest possible squeeze on its suppliers. Lidl argues that it is aware of its responsibilities and is working to improve the living and working conditions of garment workers. It audits its factories, it says, but everyone does. It does not publish the results. Hardly anyone does. Unusually, Lidl has experimented with a system of top-up bonuses for some workers, which is more than can be said for most of its rivals. But then, it really does need to. Because when your business model is based on offering the lowest possible prices, someone has to subsidise that, and that someone is the worker stitching those jeans. Lidl does not buy its jeans from Bangladesh because Dhaka\u2019s factories are the finest in the world: it does so because they pay their workers a pittance. And that, ultimately, is how it is possible to sell a pair of jeans for \u00a35.99. It\u2019s not magic. It\u2019s just exploitation.",

So it seems fitting the planned Hinkley Point nuclear power site is where contemporary political bridges may be burned, too. If you believe the story going around Westminster, the collapse of the controversial reactor project, heavily backed by George Osborne, would end his campaign to take over at Number 10, given the recent tax credit U-turn and pension retreat. But, however much the chancellor needs Hinkley, its fate will actually be decided not in Bridgwater, or London Bridge, but in the Avenue de Wagram, Paris: the headquarters of \u00c9lectricit\u00e9 de France (EDF). It is here that the future of the \u00a318bn scheme, a main part of infrastructure strategy and the key to Conservative Party energy policy, will be decided once and for all. Jean-Bernard L\u00e9vy, the EDF chief executive, is the man who is pushing for more financial help from the French government and to tie up a few more loose ends that would allow him, finally, to press the green button on Hinkley. Friends of L\u00e9vy describe him as a \u201cdictator overseeing a democracy\u201d but the stakes are high for him, too. His job is surely on the line from Fran\u00e7ois Hollande\u2019s government, given Hinkley is meant to provide a French technology showcase. Yet City analysts in Britain have described the project as \u201cinsane\u201d for a company that is already buried in a host of other problems, most of which require solving with money it has not immediately got. The temperature reached boiling point last week, when it was revealed that EDF\u2019s own finance director, Thomas Piquemal, had resigned, saying Hinkley should be postponed for at least three years while more cash was raised. Rarely has one energy project received so much attention in Britain and bystanders could be forgiven for thinking that the only thing that stands in the way of the lights going out is this one nuclear project. But Hinkley would only provide 7% of the country\u2019s electricity. If L\u00e9vy did finally plug the plug on Hinkley, rather than going ahead next month as his people indicate, it would be lights out for Osborne or Tory energy policy credibility, rather than UK plc. It is certainly a sign of the extraordinary frenzy around Hinkley that some peers have been demanding that Swansea Bay tidal lagoon must be built as the government\u2019s Plan B. Swansea Bay is a fascinating project that would be good to push forward. But it is small \u2013 320 megawatts compared to Hinkley\u2019s 3,200MW \u2013 and is based on a largely untried technology, rather than half a century of experience in nuclear power. It is also being undertaken by one entrepreneur, Mark Shorrock, and a doughty team whereas, for all its faults, EDF oversees a massive power empire and is 85%-owned by the French state. There are other UK nuclear projects \u2013 planned by two different consortia, led by Toshiba and Hitachi. They would not fall over just because Hinkley bit the dust but they are further behind in planning and confidence would surely be badly damaged. Plan B for the Conservatives would, undoubtedly, involve more fossil fuels \u2013 more gas-fired power stations \u2013 with all the implications for breaking the country\u2019s carbon emission targets. But the government has been trying to get power companies, such as Centrica, to build new gas plants by offering subsidies through the \u201ccapacity mechanism\u201d and has so far failed. Ministers, who have set their faces against subsidising onshore wind and quite a lot of solar, as well as dismantling energy efficiency schemes, would have to throw more cash at the gas power operators. They might also finally realise what Andrew Adonis\u2019s national infrastructure commission has realised: the answers partly lie in demand reduction, in interconnectors with those countries who have too much power, and technical innovation on storage. In the meantime, the smell of burning comes again from Bridgwater. Celtic tiger\u2019s roar is more of a miaow Irish economic growth in 2015 was a supersonic 7.8%, according to official figures, outpacing China, India, and every other developed economy in the world. What\u2019s more, in the final quarter, moved up yet another gear, to a breakneck 9.2% growth rate. The Celtic Tiger is roaring again. Except that it\u2019s not, really. If it were, taoiseach Enda Kenny would be enjoying a bumper majority in the D\u00e1il. Instead, he was booted out in last month\u2019s election, following an ill-judged campaign around the message of \u201ckeep the recovery going\u201d. Beyond Dublin, the response from the electorate was: \u201cWhat recovery?\u201d Ireland\u2019s Central Statistics Office is not making up the data. But the dubious behaviour of the multinationals that dominate Ireland\u2019s economy render many of the figures meaningless. Take the figure for \u201cgross fixed capital formation\u201d, which tells you how much an economy is investing. It rose by a huge 28.2% to \u20ac46bn in 2015, the chief reason why domestic demand in the Irish economy is powering ahead. Yet, nearly all of that increase was down to the Irish subsidiaries of multinationals buying intellectual property from their own shell-company subsidiaries, usually in Bermuda or the Caymans. Ironically, they are hauling these \u201cassets\u201d into Ireland, the home of European tax piracy, ahead of an expected international clampdown on the offshore shell companies. The headline export figures are just as bogus, argues economics blogger Michael Hennigan of Finfacts.ie, who says that around a third of these may merely be transfer pricing by multinationals. An assessment of the real economy would note how Dublin\u2019s restaurants and malls are packed, how the M50 is at bursting point and how office vacancies are plummeting. But it would also note that many rural towns remain deeply depressed, blighted by emigration and a still moribund property market. Ireland\u2019s recovery is real, but it\u2019s not the poster-child for austerity some claim. Growth is probably running above 3%, maybe 5%. But 7.8%? Pure blarney. What bonus season should really be like When bonus season rolls around in the City of London, chatter around the watercooler \u2013 and later in the Square Mile\u2019s historic drinking dens \u2013 turns to sports cars, exotic holidays and ski chalets. At the John Lewis Partnership \u2013 owner of the famous department store chain and Waitrose supermarkets \u2013 excited staff at the flagship Oxford Street store spoke instead of paying off credit card debts and saving for a family holiday. Each year the staff gather at shops around the UK to hear what percentage of their salary they\u2019ll be getting as a bonus. This year\u2019s 10% was the lowest in more than a decade but still the unbridled delight was palpable. One reason for this is that everyone gets the same proportion of salary. Instead of nervously measuring their success against what colleagues have got, John Lewis employees celebrate their windfall in an atmosphere of collective joy. That\u2019s why they call it a partnership.",

      "bodyText": "What a time to be a human: barely a day goes by without a new warning that the machines will steal our jobs. More news is due on this robot uprising this week when George Osborne is expected to announce a trial of driverless lorries in his budget. The World Economic Forum says more than 7 million jobs are at risk from advances in technology in the world\u2019s largest economies over the next five years. The Bank of England\u2019s chief economist, Andy Haldane, is gloomier still and warns up to 15m jobs in Britain are at risk of being lost to an age of robots. Clearly it\u2019s not a time for complacency. We are already in an age of automatic checkouts. RBS has just unveiled \u201cLuvo\u201d, an advanced artificial intelligence (AI) that it is trying out to field customer service queries. Elsewhere in financial services, robot advisers are emerging to help people invest. But as anyone familiar with the words \u201cunidentified item in bagging area\u201d can tell you, these machines are nowhere near ready to go it alone. And if we can\u2019t trust robots with our groceries, when will bank customers be ready to trust them with our life savings? The truth is that despite all the gloomy predictions that middlemen will be replaced, there are plenty of examples of where the human touch is wanted and needed in the workplace. Take translators. Sure, things like Google Translate are great for composing a postcard to a penfriend or looking up the odd word. But what happens when you try to translate anything substantial? As if to prove a point, Malinda Kathleen Reese has become an internet sensation by putting song lyrics through several languages on Google Translate, then back into English and recording them. The Disney hit Let It Go becomes Give Up. In Adele\u2019s song Hello, the line \u201cHello from the other side\u201d bizarrely morphs into \u201cWelcome to the party\u201d. Of course, it\u2019s hard to see why someone in the workplace would ever really need to go round in linguistic circles like this. But Reese\u2019s hilarious parodies offer a glimpse of the nuances and idioms that might be lost in a world where the machines take over. From the carmaking world, the largest user of industrial robots, comes similarly reassuring news that Mercedes-Benz has changed its mind and is replacing some of its assembly line robots with more capable humans. Apparently, the automatons can\u2019t cope with the many customisation options available for the company\u2019s S-Class saloon. Step up adaptable and flexible humans: they don\u2019t take days to reprogram and they can pick between ashtray finishes. Elsewhere, some companies are finding if they collaborate with new disrupters, be it machines or computers, there are gains to be made. In another middleman sector, recruitment, recruiter Hays was told to fear the worst as LinkedIn, the social network for professionals, gained ground. Hays\u2019s chief executive, Alistair Cox, recalls: \u201cPeople would say to me four, five years ago, \u2018your day\u2019s up because LinkedIn has been invented and everyone will do their recruitment online.\u2019\u201d Roll forward to today and Hays has a partnership with LinkedIn to access the network\u2019s data and help it reach more potential job candidates. \u201cSome things might look threatening and scary. But you know what, it\u2019s better to work with them and use them \u2013 and then at least work out how to defend yourself, and possibly even work out how to use it to your own advantage,\u201d says Cox. It doesn\u2019t always work out so well. In retail, the rise of IT and new ways of buying things has spelled the demise of Blockbuster film rental stores and the Borders bookshop chain. There has, of course, been a fair bit of panic in newspaper offices of late as the Independent will shortly cease printing. While businesses search for ways to survive and thrive through this latest industrial revolution, what can the government do? A lot more, says Labour\u2019s deputy leader, Tom Watson. He wants Osborne to establish a royal commission on robots. Writing for the Guardian last week, Watson argued that the government should launch an investigation into how to turn rapid advances in tech to our advantage. \u201cThe question facing us as a nation is how do we make technological change our ally, not our foe? We can\u2019t leave it to fate,\u201d he wrote. He is right. If we have driverless lorries, what will the drivers do? More importantly, who will program the robo-drivers? The government has a plan for productivity. But ministers would be wise to reassure a growing number of workers that raising our economic efficiency will not come at the cost of their jobs. That productivity plan has already been lambasted by parliament\u2019s business, innovation and skills committee for lacking original ideas on how the UK can catch up with other economies. The government could well attract further criticism if it doesn\u2019t look for ways to keep up with machines. The most obvious implications are for education. But this is not just about the oft-cited need for more science, technology and maths graduates. If it is us against them, we need to pinpoint and nurture the so-called soft-skills where humans outperform robots. The good news is that there is plenty of evidence we still can still outrank them for now, from picking out heated cup holders for cars to translating novels or wooing someone to a new job.",

But Reese\u2019s hilarious parodies offer a glimpse of the nuances and idioms that might be lost in a world where the machines take over.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1c655772501b810068f4aee85c4c8a11f4c71d1c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1c655772501b810068f4aee85c4c8a11f4c71d1c/0_0_4256_2554/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Andy Haldane of the Bank of England\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Bank Of England\u2019s Andy Haldane says 15m jobs are at risk of being lost to robots.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: ANL/REX Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>From the carmaking world, the largest user of industrial robots, comes similarly reassuring news that Mercedes-Benz has changed its mind and is <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/feb/26/mercedes-benz-robots-people-assembly-lines\" title=\"\">replacing some of its assembly line robots with more capable humans</a>. Apparently, the automatons can\u2019t cope with the many customisation options available for the company\u2019s S-Class saloon. Step up adaptable and flexible humans: they don\u2019t take days to reprogram and they can pick between ashtray finishes.</p> <p>Elsewhere, some companies are finding if they collaborate with new disrupters, be it machines or computers, there are gains to be made. In another middleman sector, recruitment, recruiter Hays was told to fear the worst as LinkedIn, the social network for professionals, gained ground. Hays\u2019s chief executive, Alistair Cox, recalls: \u201cPeople would say to me four, five years ago, \u2018your day\u2019s up because LinkedIn has been invented and everyone will do their recruitment online.\u2019\u201d Roll forward to today and Hays has a partnership with LinkedIn to access the network\u2019s data and help it reach more potential job candidates.</p> <p>\u201cSome things might look threatening and scary. But you know what, it\u2019s better to work with them and use them \u2013 and then at least work out how to defend yourself, and possibly even work out how to use it to your own advantage,\u201d says Cox.</p> <p>It doesn\u2019t always work out so well. In retail, the rise of IT and new ways of buying things has spelled the demise of Blockbuster film rental stores and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2009/nov/26/borders-goes-into-administration\" title=\"\">the Borders bookshop chain</a>. There has, of course, been a fair bit of panic in newspaper offices of late as <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/feb/12/independent-and-independent-on-sunday-closures-confirmed\" title=\"\">the <em>Independen</em>t will shortly cease printing</a>.</p> <p>While businesses search for ways to survive and thrive through this latest industrial revolution, what can the government do?</p> <p>A lot more, says Labour\u2019s deputy leader, Tom Watson. He wants Osborne to establish a royal commission on robots. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/mar/08/robots-technology-industrial-strategy\" title=\"\">Writing for the <em>Guardian</em> last week</a>, Watson argued that the government should launch an investigation into how to turn rapid advances in tech to our advantage. \u201cThe question facing us as a nation is how do we make technological change our ally, not our foe? We can\u2019t leave it to fate,\u201d he wrote.</p> <p>He is right. If we have driverless lorries, what will the drivers do? More importantly, who will program the robo-drivers?</p> <p>The government has a plan for productivity. But ministers would be wise to reassure a growing number of workers that raising our economic efficiency will not come at the cost of their jobs.</p> <p>That productivity plan has already <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/feb/01/uks-productivity-plan-is-vague-collection-of-existing-policies\" title=\"\">been lambasted by parliament\u2019s business, innovation and skills committee for lacking original ideas</a> on how the UK can catch up with other economies. The government could well attract further criticism if it doesn\u2019t look for ways to keep up with machines.</p> <p>The most obvious implications are for education. But this is not just about the oft-cited need for more science, technology and maths graduates. If it is us against them, we need to pinpoint and nurture the so-called soft-skills where humans outperform robots.</p> <p>The good news is that there is plenty of evidence we still can still outrank them for now, from picking out heated cup holders for cars to translating novels or wooing someone to a new job.</p>",

Still, after years of the retailer struggling to convince shoppers this was fun, the company suddenly became seen as the future \u2013 or, more accurately, the systems enabling its stock to be quickly moved around the country began to chime with the \u201cI want it now\u201d mentality of the age. So Argos\u2019s owner, Home Retail Group (HRG), became the target of a bid by Sainsbury\u2019s, which morphed into a bidding war when South African retailer Steinhoff trumped the grocer\u2019s offer.

Still, this week is supposedly the deadline to sort all that out \u2013 while Sainsbury\u2019s is also announcing results. The City expects the grocer to show its own expertise in delivering, predicting it will boost its shares by serving up decent numbers almost on demand. Analysts at Jefferies muse: \u201cInevitably, given the need for an equity component to a Sainsbury bid, we expect an upbeat assessment of current trading by JS.

Is he really the best choice to make Blueprint\u2019s points? Ashley\u2019s no-show raises the stakes Another week, another PR storm set to blow up around Sports Direct. The retailer has been under the cosh since a Guardian investigation in December revealed how it was paying warehouse workers effective hourly rates below the minimum wage. That prompted parliament\u2019s business, innovation and skills select committee to demand that Mike Ashley, the retailer\u2019s founder and 55% shareholder, show up for a grilling in Westminster. Committee chair Iain Wright even threatened the tycoon last week with contempt of parliament if he ducked it. Ashley has written back saying he is \u201cdisgusted\u201d with Wright for being \u201cdeliberately antagonistic\u201d and the committee will meet again on Tuesday to decide what to do next. This latest spat comes as Sports Direct finds itself without any specialist financial PR help, having sidelined its old messengers and handed all communications to Keith Bishop \u2013 Ashley\u2019s long-term sports and brands flack, but a new name on the City. Bishop\u2019s debut City announcement came last month with a stock exchange statement designed to appease supposed shareholder grumbles about related-party transactions.
