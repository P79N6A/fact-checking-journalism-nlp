Wonga, once Britain\u2019s biggest payday lender, filed for administration after a flood of compensation claims and accounting firm Grant Thornton was appointed on Friday. The company has an estimated 200,000 customers, who still owe more than \u00a3400m in short-term loans and are being told to continue making repayments. Grant Thornton also said that while customers with compensation claims over mis-selling should continue to approach the company, they would be \u201cdealt with as unsecured creditors\u201d, assuming they were valid. This means they will sit behind secured creditors when Grant Thornton doles out the proceeds from the Wonga asset sale and are unlikely to receive a full payout. The administrators said: \u201cDespite efforts to restructure the business, which included an injection of funding by the group\u2019s shareholders, the business was unable to be restored to profitability due to the level of redress claims. As a result, the management team had no alternative but to place the companies into administration. \u201cFollowing the appointment of administrators there will be no new lending activity. The administrators will conduct an orderly wind down of the business and sale of the assets and start the process of identifying all creditors, in accordance with their statutory obligations.\u201d",

    "webTitle": "Homebase rescued from collapse but 1,500 jobs to go", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Homebase is to cut 1,500 jobs as part of a rescue deal that will save the DIY chain from bankruptcy and give it breathing space to recover from the disastrous stewardship of its previous owners. Creditors voted in favour of a company voluntary arrangement (CVA), that will lead to the closure of 42 out of 241 branches, with landlords of a further 70 stores agreeing to accept rent cuts of up to 90%. Approval for the deal at Friday\u2019s crunch meeting means Homebase will stave off administration but 1,500 of its 11,000-member workforce are likely to be made redundant. Homebase\u2019s chief executive, Damian McGloughlin, said: \u201cWe now have the platform to turn the business around and return to profitability. We can look to the future with great confidence, and we will be working closely with our suppliers to capitalise on the opportunities we see in the home improvement market in the UK and Ireland.\u201d The company previously shed more than 300 head-office jobs under the ownership of the turnaround specialist Hilco, which bought Homebase for \u00a31 in May from the Australian firm Wesfarmers. The Australian company\u2019s \u00a3340m takeover, just two years earlier, has been called one of the worst acquisitions in UK corporate history. It sought to rebrand Homebase under the Bunnings name it uses in Australia and overhaul its stock offering. This moved it away from casual homewares and into heavy duty DIY and items such as large barbecues and hot tubs that sell well in Australia but have less appeal in the UK. By the time Hilco took control, 70% of the stores were losing money. Hilco said it would take the company \u201cback to its roots\u201d as part of a turnaround plan that would also pump \u00a325m of capital into the business and raise \u00a3116m of debt. The CVA is the latest in a series of similar rescue deals announced this year by struggling retail and restaurant businesses, including House of Fraser, Carluccio\u2019s, Mothercare, Jamie\u2019s Italian, Prezzo, Byron, New Look and Carpetright. Jamie Oliver revealed this week that he had to inject \u00a313m of his own money into his Jamie\u2019s Italian chain as part of a package to save it from collapse. The CVA required two separate votes, one including companies connected to Homebase and one excluding them. Homebase was almost certain to pass the first test because HHGL, a company related to Hilco, held 50% of the voting power, with 75% needed for the deal to go through. This is because HHGL holds \u00a3588m of loans that were owed to Wesfarmers when it sold to Hilco. While the loan is essentially worthless given Homebase\u2019s precarious financial position, it makes HHGL the largest creditor by far, giving it the greatest voting power. The vote also required 50% support in a second vote restricted to unconnected parties, such as suppliers and landlords.",

      "bodyText": "Markets are in a cautious mood, dragged lower by President Trump\u2019s threat to pull the US out of the WTO. There are also growing fears that Canada and the US will fail to strike a new trade deal as tonight\u2019s deadline for a NAFTA agreement draws closer. Investors were caught by surprise by the big news this morning that Whitbread is selling its Costa Coffee chain to Coca-Cola for \u00a33.9bn. The market considers it to be a good deal for Whitbread, with shares in the group up 17%. In other UK news, the opening of Crossrail has been delayed by nearly a year; the ticket resale website Viagogo is to be taken to court by the competition watchdog; and Homebase is cutting 1,500 jobs after it agreed a rescue deal with its creditors. On that note, it\u2019s time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back on Monday. US markets have opened slightly lower, as investors on both sides of the Atlantic remain concerned about prospects for global trade. Dow Jones: -0.1% at 25,954 S&amp;P 500: -0.2% at 2,897 Nasdaq: -0.1% at 8,081 DIY chain Homebase is to cut 1,500 jobs as part of a rescue deal designed to save the company from looming bankruptcy and give it breathing space to recover from the disastrous stewardship of its previous owners. Creditors owed \u00a31.2bn by the company voted in favour of a company voluntary arrangement (CVA), that will lead to the closure of 42 out of 241 branches, with landlords on a further 70 stores agreeing to accept rent cuts of up to 90%. Approval for the deal at a crunch meeting held on Friday means Homebase will stave off administration but will also mean 1,500 of its 11,000-strong workforce are likely to be made redundant. The company has already shed more than 300 jobs at its head office under the ownership of turnaround specialist Hilco, which bought Homebase for \u00a31 in May from Australian firm Wesfarmers, which paid \u00a3340m for the company just two years earlier. US markets are expected to fall when Wall Street opens, as the gloomy sentiment in Europe is echoed across the Atlantic: The delay to Crossrail is a \u201cnational embarrassment\u201d according to the Federation of Small Businesses. Mike Cherry, National Chairman of the trade body, said: This appalling situation will cause both financial and reputational damage. It is embarrassing for the UK to be seen as unable to deliver this major infrastructure project on time or on budget, with knock-on consequences for UK PLC. For Crossrail to announce such a huge delay only three months from the due date of a ten-year project is completely unacceptable. To blame \u2018complexity\u2019 is puzzling on a project which everyone knew from the beginning was complex. Small businesses along the route of the Elizabeth Line, from Berkshire to Essex and across London, have long been preparing for a December roll-out of the first phase of this vital new transport infrastructure. The delay means nine months of extra construction costs, nine months of lost revenues and nine months of continued pressure on the jam-packed transport routes Crossrail was meant to ease. In the UK, the ticket resale website Viagogo is to be taken to court by the competition watchdog for alleged breaches of consumer law after refusing repeated requests to change its practices. The Competition and Markets Authority cited a range of practices it said were breaching the rights of consumers buying tickets for live events. Andrea Coscelli, the CMA\u2019s chief executive, said: Unfortunately, while other businesses have agreed to overhaul their sites to ensure they respect the law, Viagogo has not. We will now be pursuing action through the courts to ensure that they comply with the law. Read our full story here: Over in Washington, the clock is ticking as Canadian and US negotiators attempt to reach an agreement on the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), ahead of tonight\u2019s deadline, imposed by Donald Trump. Our full story on Trump and the WTO: Another factor weighing on investor sentiment is Donald Trump\u2019s rejection of an offer from the EU to scrap tariffs on cars if the US reciprocated. The US President said the offer was \u201cnot good enough\u201d, adding that European \u201cconsumer habits are to buy their cars, not to buy our cars.\u201d Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spread Ex, said the snub was among a number of factors dragging markets lower this morning: The main issue, as is so often the case, seems to be Donald Trump, namely the fact the sabre-rattling President rejected an offer from the European Union to eliminate auto tariffs if the US did the same, claiming the deal was \u2018not good enough\u2019. There had been some hopes the US signing a trade deal with Mexico earlier in the week meant things were perhaps moving in the right direction. However, with reports that Trump is looking to impose additional tariffs on China, his threat to pull the US out of the WTO and the tense, terse situation with both the EU and Canada, the markets are back to fretting about his next move. President Trump has said he would pull out of the World Trade Organization if it doesn\u2019t give the US a better deal. He made the comments in an Oval office interview with Bloomberg: \u201cIf they don\u2019t shape up, I would withdraw from the WTO. Trump added the agreement establishing the body \u201cwas the single worst trade deal ever made.\u201d The comments have made investors jittery, adding to the (already major) uncertainty surrounding global trade. Here are the latest scores across equity markets in Europe: FTSE 100: -0.5% at 7,480 Germany\u2019s DAX: -1.1% at 12,361 France\u2019s CAC: -1.3% at 5,408 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB: -0.7% at 20,361 Spain\u2019s IBEX: -0.9% at 9,383 Europe\u2019s STOXX 600: -0.7% at 383 Away from Costa Coffee, there are plenty of other developments this morning. The opening of the \u00a315bn Crossrail line across London has been delayed by nearly a year as more time is needed to finish the infrastructure and carry out safety testing. Services on what is to be known as the Elizabeth line were due to start running in December this year, but the central section between Paddington and Abbey Wood will not be opened until autumn 2019. The Crossrail chief executive, Simon Wright, said: The Elizabeth line is one of the most complex and challenging infrastructure projects ever undertaken in the UK and is now in its final stages. We have made huge progress with the delivery of this incredible project but we need further time to complete the testing of the new railway. We are working around the clock with our supply chain and Transport for London to complete and commission the Elizabeth line. Read our full story here: Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell, spells out why investors think Whitbread has done a very good deal with Coca-Cola: Analysts had been valuing Costa at around 12 times EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) or \u00a315.50 per share. The \u00a33.9 billion sale price equates to \u00a321.25 a share and that 575p-per-share uplift explains why the shares are up so much, especially as Whitbread clearly intends to return a chunk of the cash proceeds directly to shareholders. Whitbread shares are currently up 16% at \u00a346.74. Not everyone is madly impressed by the \u00a33.9bn Costa Coffee/Coca-Cola deal. Oliver Sherman, analyst for investment firm Northern Trust Capital Markets, says investors this morning have focused on the cash windfall from the deal, rather than the long-term challenges facing the remaining Whitbread business. As changes of direction go, the announcement by Whitbread chief executive Allison Brittain that the company is selling Costa to Coca-Cola for \u00a33.9bn, rather than plan announced in April to spin it off and list it as a publicly traded company is one deserving of kudos. Whitbread has generated quite the return on the \u00a319m paid over 20 years ago. Whitbread\u2019s share price jumped in early trading as shareholders focused on the cash windfall rather than the long-term challenges ahead for Premier Inns and its related restaurants businesses. Alison Brittain, Whitbread chief executive, has been hosting a call with City analysts. When asked by one analyst why the company hadn\u2019t given a trading update, alongside the deal announcement, she said she\u2019d been focused on a \u00a33.9bn deal that was only signed at 6.52am this morning. Fair point. Some consumers are wondering what new drinks will be on offer when Coca-Cola takes ownership of Costa Coffee: The Costa Coffee brand will give Coca-Cola access to one of the few segments of the drinks market where it does not have a global brand. It also allows it to diversify away from its main business of sugary fizzy drinks, at a time when governments say they are committed to tackling rising global obesity. In Coca-Cola\u2019s own words: For Coca-Cola, the expected acquisition adds a scalable coffee platform with critical know-how and expertise in a fast-growing, on-trend category. Costa ranks as the leading coffee company in the United Kingdom and has a growing footprint in China, among other markets. Costa has a solid presence with Costa Express, which offers barista-quality coffee in a variety of on-the-go locations, including gas stations, movie theaters and travel hubs. Costa, in various formats, has the potential for further expansion with customers across the Coca-Cola system. The acquisition will expand the existing Coca-Cola coffee lineup by adding another leading brand and platform. The portfolio already includes the market-leading Georgia brand in Japan, plus coffee products in many other countries. Costa also provides Coca-Cola with strong expertise across the coffee supply chain, including sourcing, vending and distribution. This will be a complement to existing capabilities within the Coca-Cola system. Whitbread\u2019s shares are at the highest level since late 2015, as investors digest the news that the group is selling its Costa Coffee chain to Coca-Cola for \u00a33.9bn. Whitbread has pledged this morning that a \u201csignificant majority\u201d of the net proceeds from the sale of Costa will be returned to shareholders. But investors might have mixed feelings about the deal, according to Nicholas Hyett, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown: This is a bitter sweet moment for Whitbread investors. On the one hand \u00a33.9 billion is an undeniably rich valuation and likely far better than Costa could achieve as an independently listed company, valuing its earnings higher than those of the mighty Starbucks. On the other, Costa has long been the jewel in Whitbread\u2019s crown and some will be sad to see it go at any price, especially given the growth potential in China and elsewhere. It\u2019s hard to see how things could have turned out differently given the price on offer though, and Coca-Cola are one of the few companies in the world that could justify the valuation. Its global reach should turbo-charge growth in the years to come, and hot drinks are one of the few areas of the wider beverages sector where the soft drinks giant doesn\u2019t have a killer brand. Costa will get lots of care and attention. Whitbread is the runaway leader of the FTSE 100, with shares jumping 18% in early trading to \u00a347.55. Investors clearly think the group has got a deal, selling its Costa Coffee chain to Coca-Cola for \u00a33.9bn (having bought it for \u00a319m in 1995. Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK: It is with some surprise that investors are digesting today\u2019s announcement from Coca Cola that they have agreed a deal to buy the coffee chain for $5.1bn. It would appear that the US business, like a lot of its peers, is looking to diversify away from its core business of sugary drinks, an area that has been increasingly attracting government ire due to a rising global obesity problem. Investors certainly appear to like the deal, not surprising given the pledge that most of the proceeds look set to be returned to shareholders, with the shares rising strongly on the open hitting their highest levels since December 2015. Neil Wilson, chief market analyst at markets.com, says that Alison Brittain has acted faster than expected, after announcing plans in April to demerge Costa Coffee from the rest of the Whitbread group in response to investor pressure. He says it looks like a good deal for Whitbread: Clearly Coca-Cola sniffed an opportunity to gain an attractive brand with a fast-growing global presence. It\u2019s a pretty good return too on the \u00a319m Whitbread paid for the coffee chain over 20 years ago. From the Coca-Cola perspective, initial thoughts are that it marks a substantial investment in branded coffee and places it squarely against Nestle and Starbucks. Can\u2019t help but feel Coca-Cola thinks this is the ideal way into a frothy market that it\u2019s maybe missed out on so far. The sale also comes at a very tough time for Britain\u2019s high streets, and Costa has not been entirely spared, with like-for-like (LFL) sales down in the first quarter. Wilson adds: Back to the growth story at Costa, the concern is that sales growth is stalling. Costa is exposed to areas like the high street where lower footfall translates into fewer cups of coffee being sold. First quarter Costa UK sales growth of 5.2% was driven by new stores and Express machines \u2013 we note particularly strong growth in Express of 9.6% in the quarter. But LFL declined by 2%, which management put down to the \u2018general retail market conditions\u2019. We have been seeing and warning about declining LFL at Costa for some time and this 2% drop was a concern about how the brand is performing on the high street. Lower footfall is one thing, but we continue to see Costa facing tougher competition from artisan coffee retailers who are taking market share. Alison Brittain, Whitbread\u2019s chief executive, has been speaking to the BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme. She said that Coca-Cola want to buy Costa because it currently has no coffee in its range. \u201cReady to drink, cold brew coffees,\u201d could be coming our way, she suggests. Brittain added: They want the coffee product, they have no coffee in their range. You could see Costa absolutely everywhere, in vending machines, hotels, restaurants, pubs, cafes - in all the places you see Coke today. In the last few years we\u2019ve been building the brand of Costa and making it international, and so for the first time really now, we\u2019ve had an organisation like Coca-Cola who are really interested in the Costa business. The price they have offered us is significantly higher than the company could achieve through a de-merger or its own listing. Whitbread bought Costa in 1995 for \u00a319m when it had only 39 shops. It is now one of the best known names on UK high streets, and the world\u2019s second largest coffee chain after Starbucks. Costa now has almost 4,000 stores in 32 countries, including 2,400 in the UK. It also has more than 8,000 Costa Express machines in eight countries. The sale follows pressure from activist investors who argued Whitbread should be split into distinct businesses, to allow it to better focus on its Premier Inn chain of hotels and restaurant brands such as Brewers Fayre and Beefeater. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Major breaking news this morning as Whitbread announces it is selling its Costa Coffee chain to Coca Cola for \u00a33.9bn. Alison Brittain, Whitbread chief executive, said the deal was \u201cgreat news\u201d for shareholders as the price received from Coca-Cola was far higher than if it had decided to demerge the business instead. She added: Whitbread will also reduce debt and make a contribution to its pension fund, which will provide additional headroom for the expansion of Premier Inn. James Quincey, Coca-Cola president and chief executive said: Costa gives Coca-Cola new capabilities and expertise in coffee, and our system can create opportunities to grow the Costa brand worldwide. Hot beverages is one of the few remaining segments of the total beverage landscape where Coca-Cola does not have a global brand. Costa gives us access to this market through a strong coffee platform.

It would appear that the US business, like a lot of its peers, is looking to diversify away from its core business of sugary drinks, an area that has been increasingly attracting government ire due to a rising global obesity problem.</p> <p>Investors certainly appear to like the deal, not surprising given the pledge that most of the proceeds look set to be returned to shareholders, with the shares rising strongly on the open hitting their highest levels since December 2015. </p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5b88e4ade4b0c18ca380ab01\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-08-31T07:09:15.208Z\">8.09am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Neil Wilson, chief market analyst at markets.com, says that Alison Brittain has acted faster than expected, after announcing plans in April to demerge Costa Coffee from the rest of the Whitbread group in response to investor pressure.</p> <p><strong>He says it looks like a good deal for Whitbread:</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p> Clearly Coca-Cola sniffed an opportunity to gain an attractive brand with a fast-growing global presence. It\u2019s a pretty good return too on the \u00a319m Whitbread paid for the coffee chain over 20 years ago.<br></p> <p> From the Coca-Cola perspective, initial thoughts are that it marks a substantial investment in branded coffee and places it squarely against Nestle and Starbucks. Can\u2019t help but feel Coca-Cola thinks this is the ideal way into a frothy market that it\u2019s maybe missed out on so far.</p> </blockquote> <p>The sale also comes at a very tough time for Britain\u2019s high streets, and Costa has not been entirely spared, with like-for-like (LFL) sales down in the first quarter.</p> <p><strong>Wilson adds:</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p> Back to the growth story at Costa, the concern is that sales growth is stalling. Costa is exposed to areas like the high street where lower footfall translates into fewer cups of coffee being sold.</p> <p>First quarter Costa UK sales growth of 5.2% was driven by new stores and Express machines \u2013 we note particularly strong growth in Express of 9.6% in the quarter. But LFL declined by 2%, which management put down to the \u2018general retail market conditions\u2019. </p> <p>We have been seeing and warning about declining LFL at Costa for some time and this 2% drop was a concern about how the brand is performing on the high street. Lower footfall is one thing, but we continue to see Costa facing tougher competition from artisan coffee retailers who are taking market share. </p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5b88e3c1e4b0999a5de6b6a2\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-08-31T06:58:55.323Z\">7.58am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Costa will be seen 'everywhere you see Coca-Cola today'</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Alison Brittain, Whitbread\u2019s chief executive, has been speaking to the BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme.</strong><br></p> <p>She said that Coca-Cola want to buy Costa because it currently has no coffee in its range. \u201cReady to drink, cold brew coffees,\u201d could be coming our way, she suggests.</p> <p>Brittain added: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p> They want the coffee product, they have no coffee in their range.<br></p> <p>You could see Costa absolutely everywhere, in vending machines, hotels, restaurants, pubs, cafes - in all the places you see Coke today.</p> <p>In the last few years we\u2019ve been building the brand of Costa and making it international, and so for the first time really now, we\u2019ve had an organisation like Coca-Cola who are really interested in the Costa business.</p> <p>The price they have offered us is significantly higher than the company could achieve through a de-merger or its own listing.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bb448ce60983b2e887d1dee9bdb6239d93ab577e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bb448ce60983b2e887d1dee9bdb6239d93ab577e/0_0_5760_3840/1000.jpg\" alt=\"THOMOND.

When the cash machine wouldn\u2019t shell out any more, when the credit card was maxed out, my last resort was a shabby exchange bureau near Oxford Circus. They would accept me writing a cheque for \u00a350 with a cheque guarantee card (remember them?). We both knew it would bounce. But the guarantee meant he got his \u00a350, plus a fee, and I got my emergency \u00a350. The consequences would come later. This was before Wonga. If it had been around, maybe (OK, probably) I would have used them. The cost of bounced cheques - a huge earner for the \u201crespectable\u201d banks - can work out even higher than a short-term loan, even at 5,800%. It\u2019s telling that Wonga\u2019s biggest customers were always 20- to 35-year-old males. A former colleague, James Ball, wrote a searingly honest account of how he had used it. Yes, he said, they\u2019re the perfect pin-up villain \u2013 but also that they \u201chelped me, and doubtless helped plenty of other people\u201d. But before any of us feel the slightest sympathy for Wonga, always remember the story of Kane Sparham-Price, who at just 18 years old killed himself on the same day that Wonga cleared out his bank account. The question raised by many is that, with Wonga off the scene, where are people supposed to go for emergency short-term cash? After all, at its peak Wonga was used by as many as 1 million people. But the question itself is false. Wonga\u2019s jolly TV puppet adverts flogging the loans went a long way to create the demand, not just satisfy it. It made borrowing online easy, with cash available at any time, virtually instantaneously, with barely any credible checks on the borrower. Would I have borrowed larger amounts, and more frequently, if I could have done it from home rather than hang around a dodgy bureau in a back street off Oxford Circus? Almost certainly. Some figures from debt charity StepChange are instructive. It says that in 2013, when Wonga was at its peak, 23.4% of its clients had been tipped into financial disaster through high-cost, short-term credit debts. By 2017 \u2013 after financial regulators had belatedly acted to cap interest rates and fees \u2013 the number had fallen to 16.8% of its clients. There\u2019s an uncomfortable truth here. Humans enjoy instant gratification. And we\u2019ve created through the internet ways to deliver that gratification faster than ever before. We\u2019re doing it with gambling as well. The flood of late night gambling adverts that pollute every commercial TV station fosters the same sort of \u201cdemand\u201d that Wonga created. Yes, the rise of Wonga was also about the financial crash, unemployment, job insecurity, zero-hour contracts, austerity and the other ills of 21st century life. But they won\u2019t disappear if Wonga goes. Our error has been to make borrowing too easy. Every Anglo-Saxon economy has now sunk into levels of debt unimaginable just a few decades ago. One acquaintance, moaning about her debt (overdrawn within days of her salary cheque going in), laid bare her finances to me. The shock was the \u00a3350 a month going to a car finance company for a dazzling new car. Why on earth had a 23-year-old on a low income taken out such an absurd commitment? It was just too easy. When I had a small debt problem in the 1980s, Wonga would not have been the solution. My small debt problem would just have turned into a big debt problem. The real lesson from Wonga is that, actually, regulation works. It was laid low by intervention to cap rates and fees. So when people say what are we going to do to replace Wonga, the answer should be: as little as possible.",
