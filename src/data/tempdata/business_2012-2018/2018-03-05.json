      "bodyText": "And finally.... Wall Street has closed, with a small but surprising rally that ends a four-day losing streak. The Dow Jones finished the day up around 344 points, or 1.4%. The S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq also finished in the green, up around 1%. So, what happened to those concerns about a trade war? Some traders are suggesting that the fears were overstated, especially with Paul Ryan and the WTO both weighing in. Today\u2019s strong US service sector data is another factor - reminding investors that America\u2019s economy remains robust. Fiona Cincotta, Market Analyst at City Index, explains: Wall Street started the week on the back foot, sinking lower as trade war fears spilled over from last week\u2019s announcement by Trump. However, stronger than forecast ISM non-manufacturing data quickly grabbed trader\u2019s attention boosting sentiment and returning risk appetite to the market. ISM non-manufacturing data printed at 59.5, ahead of tht 59 forecast, albeit a slight dip from last month\u2019s 59.9. That\u2019s all for today. Thanks for reading and commenting. GW Here\u2019s our news story on the unfolding battle over trade and tariffs in America: Republican leader Paul Ryan publicly split with Donald Trump on Monday over the president\u2019s threat to impose tariffs on the US\u2019s trading partners on steel and aluminium. The House speaker became the most senior Republican to publicly distance himself from Trump\u2019s tariffs, which have rattled stock markets worldwide and sparked threats of retaliation. \u201cWe are extremely worried about the consequences of a trade war and are urging the White House to not advance the plan,\u201d AshLee Strong, Ryan\u2019s spokeswoman said in a statement. She said the tariffs plan threatened to jeopardize the impact of Trump\u2019s recently introduced $1.5tn tax reforms. Ryan\u2019s split came shortly after Trump had doubled down on the tariff plan in a pair of tweets. The president reiterated his displeasure with trade deficits with Mexico and Canada, two of the US\u2019s largest trading partners. Metals duties will only be removed on America\u2019s neighbours to the north and south, he said, after a \u201cnew and fair\u201d free trade agreement is signed. Trump followed up with another tweet proclaiming: \u201cTo protect our Country we must protect American Steel! #AMERICA FIRST.\u201d More here.... BREAKING: Donald Trump isn\u2019t backing down, in the face of criticism from the World Trade Organisation and House Speaker Paul Ryan. The US president has just declared that he doesn\u2019t think tariffs on steel and aluminum will lead to a trade war, and he won\u2019t change his position. Speaking at the Oval Office, during a visit from Israel\u2019s Benjamin Netanyahu, Trump says China is the biggest problem on trade. The president also claims that America gets a very bad deal from Mexico today. He also hints that Mexico and Canada might get an exemption from the tariffs, if a \u201cgood deal\u201d can be reached on NAFTA (something he tweeted about earlier). Newsflash: The World Trade Organisation has warned that there is a real risk of plunging into a new trade war. Roberto Azev\u00eado, the head of the WTO, told members that Donald Trump\u2019s plan for a 25% tariff on steel imports, and 10% on aluminium, could be very damaging. Azev\u00eado says it would be \u201cvery hard\u201d to prevent retaliatory action, so it\u2019s vital to prevent the first dominos falling now. In a statement, Azev\u00eado warns that a trade war, with tit-for-tat sanctions, could result in a \u2018deep\u2019 global recession. Here\u2019s his warning: \u201cIn light of recent announcements on trade policy measures,it is clear that we now see a much higher and real risk of triggering an escalation of trade barriers across the globe.\u201d \u201cWe cannot ignore this risk and I urge all parties to consider and reflect on this situation very carefully. Once we start down this path it will be very difficult to reverse direction. An eye for an eye will leave us all blind and the world in a deep recession.\u201d U.S. House Speaker Paul Ryan has weighed in, urging the Trump administration not to implement the new tariffs on steel and aluminum announced by the president last week. Ryan fears that the move would hurt the US economy, and wipe out the benefits of the recent tax cuts. AshLee Strong, a spokeswoman for Ryan, says: \u201cWe are extremely worried about the consequences of a trade war and are urging the White House to not advance with this plan. The new tax reform law has boosted the economy and we certainly don\u2019t want to jeopardize those gains.\u201d After a late rally, European markets have closed higher mostly higher. Not in Italy, though, where the FTSE MIB ended the day 0.4% lower at 21,819. That\u2019s a recovery from its early morning selloff. In London, the FTSE 100 finished 46 points higher, or +0.65%, at 7,115 points - up from Friday night\u2019s 14-month low. The City was cheered to learn that service sector growth hit a four-month high last month (but not so impressed by the latest fall in car sales) In Germany, the DAX ended 1.5% higher at investors welcomed the news that Angela Merkel has secured a coalition deal with the Social Democrats. In other news, a former Deutsche Bank trader has been fined \u00a3180,000 for his role in the Libor-rigging scandal. Guillaume Adolph was also banned from working in the City, having tried to influence the information which Deutsche had submitted to the Libor panel. Mark Steward, Director of Enforcement and Market Oversight at the FCA said: \u201cMr Adolph improperly influenced several of Deutsche\u2019s LIBOR submissions in disregard of standards governing LIBOR submissions. Mr Adolph\u2019s misconduct threatened the integrity of important benchmarks. He should have no further role in the financial services industry.\u201d Adolph had been nicknamed \u201cGollum\u201d by Tom Hayes, the UBS trader who was jailed in 2015 for manipulating benchmark interest rates. Ouch! The Canadian dollar just hit an eight-month low against the US dollar. The \u2018Loonie\u2019, as it\u2019s known in the markets, has weakened to $1.2975 - a level last seen in July 2017. That reflects concerns that Donald Trump\u2019s latest burst of protectionism could cut Canadian exports into the US, hurting Canada\u2019s economy. As this charts shows, the dollar has enjoyed a mixed performance against other currencies - and fell against several major rivals. Capital Economic\u2019s John Higgins explains: All else equal, the proposed tariffs might have been expected to boost the dollar against the currencies of other major economies too, as the duties would reduce US demand for exports from those countries. But the greenback has actually weakened on average against its \u201cmajor\u201d peers. The Japanese yen and Swiss franc, traditionally seen as safe havens, have performed particularly well. This is presumably also a product of the retreat from risk which has hit EM currencies. More generally, investors appear to have concluded that a marked shift towards protectionism in the US would ultimately see its economy fare worse than those of other developed markets. Goldman Sachs have predicted that the NAFTA negotiations in Mexico will fail to make a breakthrough (having been somewhat derailed by Trump\u2019s new tariffs): Here\u2019s confirmation that Italy is looking at a hung parliament, with Five Star Movement scooping the most votes but the centre-right parties collectively forming the largest bloc. Boom! America\u2019s service sector grew strongly in February, thanks to a surge in new orders. The Institute for Supply Management\u2019s monthly US service sector PMI came in at 59.5, ahead of forecasts, and close to January\u2019s 59.9. Any reading over 50 shows growth, and these levels suggest the US economy rattled along last month. Firms told the ISM that new business surged, pushing up the \u2018new orders\u2019 index to its highest rate since 2005. Some also cited Donald Trump\u2019s recent tax reforms, although there was also anxiety about last month\u2019s stock market volatility. A separate PMI survey from Markit has hit its highest level since last August, confirming that American services firms did pretty well last month. Here\u2019s some snap reaction: As predicted, shares are dipping at the start of trading in New York. The Dow Jones industrial average has dropped by almost 150 points, or 0.6%, following Donald Trump\u2019s latest burst of tweeting. Lawrence Mills of Finsa Markets says that \u201cTrump trade war fears are leading to market nervousness\u201d. Just in: Credit Suisse has cut its rating on Italian shares, following Sunday\u2019s election. Back on Italy....and Richard Carter of investment management firm Quilter Cheviot predicts that the centre-right parties will assemble a \u2018shaky\u2019 coalition: He writes: \u201cArguably the performance of the Five Star Movement is another leg of the anti-establishment trend that has brought us Brexit and Trump, but the market reaction has been very sanguine so far. Uncertainty and unstable coalitions is not exactly a new phenomenon when it comes to Italian politics and the likelihood is that some sort of shaky centre-right government will be cobbled together in the coming weeks. The most important thing for investors is that Italy\u2019s place in the Euro or the EU does not look to be under threat at the current time while ongoing QE from the Eurozone Central Bank will keep a lid on Italian government borrowing costs.\u201d If Carter\u2019s right, then Matteo Salvini of the right-wing Northern League will play a key role. So you should check out our preview of the man who scooped up more votes than Silvio Berlusconi with an anti-immigrant, pro-Russian and anti-EU platform. German carmakers are coming under more pressure, as investors worry about a trade war breaking out across the Atlantic (as explained earlier). Here\u2019s Justin Benson, Head of Automotive at KPMG in the UK, on the latest fall in UK car sales: \u201cDiesel car sales continue to fall, albeit at a slower rate than recent months. However, diesel should still be a relevant choice for consumers, as the latest technology does help address air quality issues. Whilst sales for petrol and alternatively fuelled vehicles are increasing, they are not filling the gap. Consumer confidence is low and the evidence suggests people are keeping their cars for longer before making a buying decision. Whether or not this is due to Brexit is hard to say, but the automotive industry needs certainty in order to maximise new car sales growth. Britain\u2019s service sector is still growing slower than major European rivals, despite the pick-up last month. Reuters Andy Bruce has the details: Donald Trump certainly isn\u2019t backing down on his tariffs, despite concerns that protectionism will hurt economic growth and could trigger a trade war. A few years ago, Matteo Renzi was being hailed as the bright young hope for Italian politics. Back then, the young mayor of Florence was challenging the old guard and promising to reform Italy. But then he seized power, in early 2014, by shunting PM Enrico Letta aside - only to be brought down in 2016 after the public rejected a referendum on electoral reforms. Last night\u2019s election results were a chastening reminder of how Renzi\u2019s career has nose-dived (a fate shared more widely by social democratic parties). There are now reports that he\u2019ll resign as head of the Democratic Party. From Rome, my colleague Stephanie Kirchgaessner explains: The centre-left coalition headed by Matteo Renzi did worse than expected, winning 19% of the vote according to early results. While Renzi\u2019s leading lieutenant, Maria Elena Boschi, won a safe parliamentary seat in South Tyrol in northern Italy, two other prominent politicians, the interior minister, Marco Minniti, and the culture minister, Dario Franceschini, were defeated. The dismal showing prompted reports that Renzi, who was prime minister from February 2014 until December 2016, has stepped down as head of the Democratic party (PD). Francesco Galietti, an analyst in Rome, said: \u201cRenzi has been obliterated in what is perhaps the shortest boom-to-bust cycle of Italy\u2019s political history. Early data suggest the PD won less than 20% of the vote, less than half its share in the EU elections of 2014, and it won\u2019t be long before the non-Renzian forces of the left all go for the jugular.\u201d More here: Back over in Italy, the head of the right-wing Northern League has declared his party are ready to form the country\u2019s next government. Matteo Salvini also told reporters in Milan that investors shouldn\u2019t cower from a new centre-right coalition, insisting: The markets have nothing to fear. The Northern League won around 18% of the votes, beating Silvio Berlusconi\u2019s Forza Italia party to become the leading right-wing party. Although the anti-establishment Five Star Movement won the greatest share of the vote (around 32%), the Northern League and its fellow right-wing parties have some 37% between them. Forming a coalition will be very tricky, but Richard Turnill, BlackRock\u2019s Global Chief Investment Strategist, suspects a deal will be found. It could include the Democratic Party, which had a bad election with just 19% of votes. Turnill says: \u201cWe believe it unlikely that M5S will partner with Lega to form a government. Lega\u2019s ambition is to lead the center-right coalition rather than be a junior partner in an unstable alliance with M5S. At some point, an increasingly mainstream M5S and the center-left Democratic Party may warm up to each other. A new Italian parliament needs to be convened by March 23, yet negotiations are likely to drag on beyond then. Political noise is poised to remain high until a sustainable coalition emerges. Newsflash: President Trump has just tweeted that the new planned tariffs on steel and aluminum could be changed...if America can get a \u201cnew and fair\u201d trade agreement with NAFTA. He\u2019s also pushing Canada over agriculture trade, and Mexico over border controls. Officials from the US, Canada and Mexico have been renegotiations the NAFTA pact for several days. Trump\u2019s plan to slap 25% tariffs on steel imports, and 10% on aluminum, have threatened to derail those talks, with Mexican and Canadian ministers keen to be get a blanket exemption. The threat of a trade war between the United Stats and the European Union is weighing on European carmakers today. Shares in BMW are down 1%, Daimler are down 0.3% and Renault has lost 0.35%. This comes after Donald Trump tweeted on Saturday that he would impose a tax on European cars if the EU followed through on its threat of tariffs on US bourbon, jeans and motorbikes. Overnight, the president also defended his new tariffs on steel and aluminium, despite UK PM Theresa May expressing concern yesterday. Back in the markets, the Italian FTSE MIB is still down 1% as traders in Milan face the prospect of a hung parliament after Sunday\u2019s election. David Madden of CMC Markets says investor confidence in Italy has been shaken by the surge in support for Five Star Movement and the Northern League, at the expense of more mainstream parties. The votes are still being counted, but the early indication is there will be no majority. Added uncertainty comes from the rise of the anti-establishment Five-Star Movement. Traders fear the nation could be plunged into a period of political unpredictability, and this could delay much-needed reforms. Claudio Ferrarese, portfolio manager at Fidelity International, says there could be weeks of uncertainty: \u201cA grand coalition is still possible, but smaller, traditional parties however, are in a position of weakness, and will have to strike a deal with the M5S or the Lega. More importantly, even though the Lega and the M5S will have a greater say in the political agenda, the more extreme views from either party are likely to be tamed somewhat once they get into power. Their anti-European rhetoric is already much softer than it was in the past, although they will place greater focus on fiscal easing, and a more confrontational attitude towards European partners. \u201cThe political horse trading will now start and the first smoke will come for the election of the presidents of the chambers within the next three or four of weeks. That would be something to watch, depending on the names that are chosen, it will give a lead on where the coalition talks are going. But the big swing towards populist parties isn\u2019t causing too much angst in other markets. The markets may be concluding that political deadlock in Italy remains a domestic problem. In London, the FTSE 100 has gained 25 points, having hit a 14-month low on Friday night. Here\u2019s our latest news story on the elections: Britain\u2019s baby boomers should be hit with new wealth taxes, to spare younger generations from massive tax rises. That might sound like a line from Labour\u2019s John McDonnell. But actually, former Conservative minister David Willetts is the one calling for action to tackle intergenerational unfairness. Willetts, who now chairs the Resolution Foundation, is speaking in London this morning, saying: \u201cAs we baby boomers sit on so much wealth \u2013 which has continued to grow even as incomes have stagnated \u2013 one obvious source is for us to make a contribution through capital or property taxes... \u201cBy the end of the next decade, the fiscal gap is set to grow to the equivalent today of \u00a320bn a year and then to \u00a360bn after another decade. That translates to an income tax hike of 15p in the basic rate by 2040, the burden of which will overwhelmingly fall on the generations following baby boomers. My colleague Richard Partington is there, tweeting the key points: Newsflash: Greece has recorded its fourth quarter of growth in a row.... just. Greek GDP rose by 0.1% in the final three months of 2017, according to statistics body Elstat. Elstat also revised up its estimate for growth between July and September 2017, from 0.3% to 0.4%. Growth for 2017 as a whole came in at 1.4%. Nathan Coe, chief finance officer of Auto Trader, reckons anxiety over Britain\u2019s exit from the EU is deterring people from buying new cars: \u201cThe dip in new car registrations continues to reflect the serious decline in diesel sales and the broader UK economic environment. \u201cThis is further compounded by the uncertainty car buyers have over Brexit, with over sixty per cent saying it is causing them to delay or change their car buying plans. You could call it Brexiety I suppose! Britain\u2019s service sector was surprisingly strong last month, says Jeremy Cook, Chief Economist at WorldFirst. He\u2019s encouraged that firms reported that their cost pressures have eased recently: \u201cHigher orders and higher employment buoyed the service sector in February with the global economic recovery allowing for an uptick in new business. Interestingly, price pressures weakened to their lowest in 18 months and may limit the immediate need for a rate rise from the Bank of England at the May meeting. It is good news that the pressures on margins and costs from exchange rates have been seen to lessen in the past few months or so with UK SMEs maintaining a very \u2018wait-and-see\u2019 approach to hedging. Newsflash: Growth in Britain\u2019s service sector has risen to a four-month high. Data firm Markit reports that activity in the dominant sector of the UK economy rebounded modestly in February. Firms reported that new business jumped last month, encouraging them to take on more staff. Markit says: Growth of incoming new business picked up for the second month running and reached its strongest since May 2017. Service providers commented on particularly marked business-to-business sales growth in February, helped by the improving global economic backdrop. However, there were also reports that stretched household budgets remained a factor holding back domestic consumer demand. This pushed its UK service sector PMI, which tracks activity, up to 54.5 in February, from 53.0 in January. Any reading over 50 shows growth. Duncan Brock, director of customer relationships at the Chartered Institute of Procurement &amp; Supply, says UK consumers remained cautious last month. In fact it was business customers that had the confidence to forge ahead with orders, as consumers hesitated over concerns about possible rate rises impacting on their household budgets and what the future could hold. \u201cBut it was encouraging to see job seekers were the winners as hiring levels continued to rise and at the fastest rate since September 2017. Firms were eager to reduce accumulated backlogs in part created by difficulties in finding talented, skilled staff and in a period of exceptionally low unemployment. Growth in the eurozone\u2019s service sector dipped last month, from 58 to 56.2, including a small slowdown in Italy... Today\u2019s figures also show that petrol cars now make up 60% of the UK market, up from just 51% a year ago. That\u2019s bad news for Britain\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions, as the FT\u2019s Peter Campbell tweets: Howard Archer of the EY Item Club says Britain\u2019s car industry is stuck in the slow lane. Here\u2019s his take on the latest fall in car sales. Sales of diesel cars (down 23.5% year-on-year in February) have been decimated by pollution concerns and expectations of related government action to counter this. While this contributes substantially to the weakness in car sales, the overall softness has run deeper than this as the pick-up in demand for petrol (up 14.4% year-on-year in February) and alternatively fuelled vehicles (up 7.2%) has been insufficient to compensate for the slump in diesel sales February\u2019s 2.0% drop in private sector car sales points to squeezed, uncertain consumers still being reluctant to make major purchases. While uncertainty over government policy on diesel cars has clearly affected fleet sales, another drop in February (down 2.5% year-on-year) also suggests that businesses are currently cautious in their car purchases amid significant economic and political uncertainties. Many businesses have likely become increasingly inclined to delay replacing vehicles. Newsflash: UK car sales have fallen again, as drivers continue to shun new diesel models. The SMMT reports that new car registrations dropped by 2.8% in February, compared to a year earlier, with 80,805 models sold. This is the 11th month of falling sales in a row, and means sales in 2018 are down 5.1% compared to a year ago. Diesel sales slumped by 23.5%, while petrol sales rose 14.4% and electric car sales rose by 7.2%. The SMMT says the slump in diesel registrations is \u201cdisappointing....given the latest low emission vehicles can help address air quality issues.\u201d It suspects that diesel car owners are keeping their older cars for longer, following the emissions scandal (which has hurt demand for second-hand diesels). February is usually a quiet month for car sales, as buyers hang on for the new number places next month. However, the SMMT is already warning that sales could be down in March. Mike Hawes, SMMT chief executive, says: Looking ahead to the crucial number plate change month of March, we expect a further softening, given March 2017 was a record as registrations were pulled forward to avoid VED [road tax] changes.\u201d Elliot Hentov, head of policy and research for official institutions for EMEA at State Street Global Advisors says the Italian election result should be a wake-up call to investors. He argues that the eurozone crisis, dormant for so long, isn\u2019t actually over: \u201cThe Italian status quo \u2013 political inertia in the face of economic decline \u2013 is simply not sustainable in the long-term and Italian voters are restless. It remains to be seen whether the Five Star Movement can actually lead a government as any other constellation looks unfeasible. The fact that a majority of votes went to parties outside of the mainstream is likely to be a warning for markets that Italy\u2019s and Europe\u2019s core challenges remain unresolved. All roads lead to Rome, at least when it comes to boosting the Eurozone\u2019s viability, and markets will take note that euro assets need to reflect more than just the relatively buoyant economy. On the contrary, it is increasingly clear that the Eurozone drama is far from over, even if we may be enjoying the current intermission.\u201d Italian bank stocks have hit a two-month low this morning, Reuters reports. Mujtaba Rahman of Eurasia Group says investors are worried that Italy\u2019s populist parties would clash with Brussels over tax and spending rules, should they end up in power: Euro exit, let alone EU exit remain very unlikely, as is a meaningful revision of the EU\u2019s treaties to Italy\u2019s favour, something both the League and Five Star have campaigned on. A bigger risk is the possibility of meaningful fiscal slippage, as either party moves to implement some of their flagship campaign pledges. This will create more friction between Rome and the European commission. Italy is already at risk of failing to comply with EU-mandated fiscal targets, and any additional slippage may result in a new Excessive Deficit Procedure. Any attempts to roll back past reforms, most notably the 2011 pension reform, will also be seen with concern by investors My colleagues have been live-blogging the Italian election through the night - and are covering all the reaction this morning: Over in Milan, the Italian stock market has fallen in early trading. The benchmark FTSE MIB index tumbled by 2% at the open. It then stabilised around 1% lower, so there\u2019s no sign of actual panic. Unicredit, Italy\u2019s largest bank, has shed 2.5% while UBI Banca are down 3.8%. Rebecca O\u2019Keeffe, Head of Investment at interactive investor, says the markets are nervous. \u201cItaly looks to have taken a step to the right and moved towards populism and change. The complexity of the Italian voting system makes it very difficult to establish what happens next and when, but neither of the anti-establishment Five star movement or League parties are an attractive option for markets or the euro.\u201d Shares in Silvio Berlusconi\u2019s Mediaset company have fallen by over 4% after his Forza Italia party did worse than expected in Sunday\u2019s election, lagging behind the Northern League. Mediaset has been fighting a long legal battle with France\u2019s Vivendi, and a strong showing by Forza Italia would have strengthened its hand. Italian government bonds are falling in early trading, as investors worry that the country faces a period of instability. This has pushed the interest rate (or yield) on 10-year Italian bonds up to 2.11%, from 2.03% on Friday. That suggests they\u2019re seen as as little riskier today - especially when compared to German debt. T The euro has dipped in early trading. It\u2019s down around 0.3% at $1.228 against the US dollar following the Italian election results. Hussein Sayed, chief market strategist at FXTM, explains: The Euro found no support after Germany\u2019s Social Democratic party voted for a coalition deal with Angela Merkel\u2019s CDU party. The muted Euro reaction is mainly due to worries that the Italian elections delivered a hung parliament. The European Union would have a new headache to deal with if Italy formed a Eurosceptic coalition which would undoubtedly challenge EU budget rules. Several of the Italian parties had pledged to abolish the EU\u2019s fiscal compact, which would allow member states to borrow more. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Investors are jittery this morning as they digest Sunday\u2019s Italian election results, and brace for further ratcheting up of the tensions over Donald Trump\u2019s steel and aluminium tariffs. Over in Italy, populist parties are celebrating - even though the election has delivered a hung parliament. Around half of voters abandoned the traditional mainstream parties, delivering a stinging rebuke to the centre-left Democratic Paty. The anti-establishment Five Star Movement - no fan of the euro - came first with around 31% of the votes, according to preliminary voting. The right-wing anti-immigration Northern League also had a good night, securing 17% of the vote. That means that Silvio Berlusconi\u2019s centre-right bloc could end up back in power. As my colleague Stephanie Kirchgaessner reports from Rome, a populist wave has swept Italy: Andrea Marcucci, one of the Democratic party\u2019s senators in the outgoing parliament, wrote on his Facebook page: \u201cVoters have spoken very clearly and irrefutably. The populists have won and the Democratic party has lost.\u201d The exit polls showed Berlusconi\u2019s coalition \u2013 which includes the Northern League \u2013 winning up to 36% of the vote, a result that could potentially help the billionaire media magnate clinch a fourth election victory under a complicated Italian election law. Analysts were also poring over early data that suggested another potential political upset: Matteo Salvini, the firebrand head of La Lega \u2013 as the Northern League is now known \u2013 beating out Berlusconi within the centre-right coalition. Under a \u201cgentleman\u2019s agreement\u201d, whoever emerges as the winner between the two will choose the next prime minister, if the coalition were to win a majority. Italy now faces a period of negotiations and horse-trading as the various parties try to cobble a deal together. That uncertainty is going to hit European markets today. with Germany, France and Italy all expected to fall. There have already been losses in Asia overnight: The Italian election result distracts from the news that Angela Merkel has secured a coalition deal with Germany\u2019s Social Democratic Party. The markets ended last week on a low point, after president Trump\u2019s plans to impose tariffs on imported steel and aluminium sparked threats of retaliation from Europe. The UK prime minister, Theresa May, has now waded in, telling Trump that Britain has \u201cdeep concern\u201d about the plan. A government spokeswoman explains: \u201cThe prime minister raised our deep concern at the president\u2019s forthcoming announcement on steel and aluminium tariffs, noting that multilateral action was the only way to resolve the problem of global overcapacity in all parties\u2019 interests. Adam Cole of Royal Bank of Canada says investors are bracing for more developments this week: Markets have a mildly risk-off tone overnight as the threat of a trade war continues to overhang. Over the weekend, administration officials in the US said there would be no exemptions to the new tariffs and reports suggest the EU could respond with reciprocal measures as early as this Wednesday. Here\u2019s what\u2019s coming up today: The agenda 9am GMT: Eurozone service sector PMI for February 9am GMT: UK car sales figures for February 9.30am GMT: UK service sector PMI for February 3pm GMT: US service sector PMI for February",

      "bodyText": "Thousands of staff at two Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) car plants have been sent home, while chocolate production has been halted at Cadbury\u2019s Bourneville factory, amid water shortages in the West Midlands caused by burst water mains after the recent cold weather. The local water company, Severn Trent, said it had asked a \u201chandful of big businesses\u201d to shut down factories as it tried to prioritise household supplies. Neither JLR nor Severn Trent could say how long the shutdown would last at its Solihull and Castle Bromwich plants, which employ 14,000 people between them making models including the Range Rover, Land Rover Discovery and Jaguar F-Pace. But even a temporary closure is likely to prove costly for JLR, given that about 450,000 vehicles a year \u2013 more than 1,200 a day \u2013 roll off the production lines at the two factories. Mondel\u0113z, the parent company of Cadbury, said the UK\u2019s chocolate supplies would not be affected by the temporary shutdown at its historic Bourneville site because it had \u201csufficient stock available to manage through this hopefully short disruption\u201d. The UK\u2019s water regulator, Ofwat, warned it would not \u201chesitate to intervene\u201d if suppliers were found to have been ill-prepared for the cold weather, after thousands of homes were left without water. Severn Trent is expected to have to pay compensation to JLR as a result of the shutdown. Water companies have blamed the situation on the rapid thaw after last week\u2019s snow and freezing temperatures. Thames Water previously advised its customers to limit their water usage while it dealt with the aftermath of the thaw, after at least 23,800 households were left without water. Welsh Water said unprecedented challenges had affected 4,500 homes, while Scottish Water said it had not suffered a significant problem because the thaw had been less rapid further north. Severn Trent earlier apologised to people in the Birmingham area who experienced shortages while it dealt with a 4,000% increase in the number of burst pipes. It said JLR and Cadbury\u2019s temporary closure would help it put domestic customers first. \u201cWe\u2019ve been working with a handful of big businesses in the area about ways they can reduce their water usage, in the same way that we\u2019re asking our customers to do the same in their homes,\u201d said the utility. \u201cThis is all part of our normal procedures to prioritise getting water to households and vulnerable customers including hospitals and care homes to keep them on supply. As we work to get the network back to normal, we\u2019re also ramping up production at our treatment works, bringing in extra teams to fix the bursts and using our tankers to support local hospitals. \u201cWe\u2019d like to thank the few businesses we\u2019ve been working with over the past couple of days for all of their help.\u201d A message to staff in Solihull from JLR advised staff to check a Facebook page for employees of the factory. JLR said: \u201cEmployees are being sent home and those due to attend work on the night shift this evening are being stood down. We will continue to keep employees informed as the situation develops.\u201d Rachel Fletcher, chief executive of Ofwat, said: \u201cWhen the taps are back on, we will take a long, hard look at what has happened here and we won\u2019t hesitate to intervene if we find that companies have not had the right structures and mechanisms in place to be resilient enough. \u201cWhile the recent severe freeze and thaw have undoubtedly had an impact on pipes and infrastructure, this weather was forecast in advance. A number of water companies appear to have fallen well short on their forward planning and the quality of support and communication they\u2019ve been providing, leaving some customers high and dry.\u201d",

We will continue to keep employees informed as the situation develops.\u201d</p> <p>Rachel Fletcher, chief executive of Ofwat, said: \u201cWhen the taps are back on, we will take a long, hard look at what has happened here and we won\u2019t hesitate to intervene if we find that companies have not had the right structures and mechanisms in place to be resilient enough.</p> <p>\u201cWhile the recent severe freeze and thaw have undoubtedly had an impact on pipes and infrastructure, this weather was forecast in advance. A number of water companies appear to have fallen well short on their forward planning and the quality of support and communication they\u2019ve been providing, leaving some customers high and dry.\u201d</p>",

In a sign of growing international alarm at the possible consequences of Trump\u2019s protectionist measures, Roberto Azevedo, the WTO\u2019s director general, said \u201cin the light of recent announcements on trade policy measures, it is clear we now see a much higher and real risk of triggering an escalation of trade barriers around the world\u201d. The US president responded to Azevedo\u2019s warning \u2013 and a separate call from the Paul Ryan, the Republican speaker of the House of Representatives \u2013 by saying he would not back down on last week\u2019s threat to put a 25% tariff on steel imports and a 10% tariff on aluminium imports. Trump rejected the idea that his measures \u2013 announced as a way of defending America\u2019s national security \u2013 would lead to a trade war, even though his announcement has already prompted the threat of retaliation from the European Union, Canada, Brazil and China. Azevedo told a tense meeting of WTO members in Geneva that \u201can eye for an eye will leave us all blind and the world in deep recession\u201d. Tit-for-tat protectionism was a feature of the 1930s as countries sought to find ways of helping domestic manufacturers through the Great Depression. \u201cWe must make every effort to avoid the fall of the first dominoes,\u201d Azevedo said. WTO officials said the EU, Mexico, Japan, Australia, South Korea, Canada and India were among the members at the meeting expressing \u201cvery strong concerns\u201d about Trump\u2019s proposals. Pressure on the White House was increased by Ryan, who said the risks to the economy meant the president should halt the planned tariffs. \u201cWe are extremely worried about the consequences of a trade war and are urging the White House to not advance with this plan. The new tax reform law has boosted the economy and we certainly don\u2019t want to jeopardise those gains,\u201d said AshLee Strong, a spokeswoman for Ryan, the leading Republican in the House. Trump hinted that he might be using the threat of tariffs as a bargaining device in his attempt to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta). He said Mexico and Canada \u2013 other members of Nafta \u2013 might be exempted from the levies if they offered the US a better deal. Andrew Kenningham, chief global economist at Capital Economics, said the flimsy national security reasons cited by Trump as justification increased the risk of retaliation. \u201cThe real worry is that this marks a turning point in US trade policy, away from bluster and brinkmanship towards actual protectionist measures. \u201cWe have consistently warned that this would become more likely as the mid-term and presidential elections approach. If so, President Trump may discover that there are rarely any winners from trade wars.\u201d",

The European aerospace manufacturer said it would soon have to decide whether to start stockpiling parts to avoid border delays, adding costs that could make its British operations uncompetitive. Katherine Bennett, senior vice-president for Airbus in the UK, said that despite some welcome assurances from government over Brexit, the firm feared that customs and paperwork would delay its manufacturing process. Airbus employs about 15,000 people in the UK and moves parts between other EU countries and wing-making operations at Broughton in north Wales and Filton, near Bristol. Bennett said: \u201cIt\u2019s critical for our business to ensure that the wings that we build in Broughton and in Filton can get to France and Germany for the final assembly line.\u201d Bennett said that Airbus spends about \u00a35bn each year on the UK supply chain. \u201cIt\u2019s really important that the parts don\u2019t get held up in warehouses. We have a very just-in-time delivery system.\u201d She told the BBC Today programme that a three-hour wait on a lorry at Dover \u201cwould be a critically bad issue for Airbus\u201d, as would be delaying cargo flights carrying completed wings to Europe. While she welcomed the announcement in Theresa May\u2019s Mansion House speech that Britain intended to remain a member of EASA, the air safety certification agency, Bennett warned that customs remained \u201cpretty critical for us\u201d and said that Airbus very soon \u201cwill have to press a button on a decision on stockpiling parts\u201d. She added: \u201cIt would be very expensive for us and a burden we don\u2019t want to be suffering. Our key preference is for the UK to remain a home nation for Airbus. But we really need the conditions for us to be effective. We don\u2019t want extra costs on our UK business which may make Airbus think differently about us.\u201d Meanwhile, Airbus management is to meet unions on Wednesday to discuss potential job losses as it slows the rate of production on two of its flagship aircraft, the A380 superjumbo and the troubled A400M military transporter. A deal on the A380 with Emirates airline guaranteed production until the mid-2020s, but Airbus will reduce its output from 12 planes per year to just eight in 2019 and six in 2020. In a statement, Airbus said leaks to the media over the slowdowns had \u201cresulted in excessive reporting about alleged job cuts in its four home countries\u201d. According to one report in the French business press, up to 3,600 jobs could be affected. An Airbus spokesman said that an increased rate of production on the A320 and A350 models should mean no jobs would be lost in the UK.",

      "bodyText": "Anyone in the mood for discovering the end result of short-term, politically driven economic policy could do worse than read the Grattan Institute\u2019s latest report on housing affordability. It is a report that shows the result of 30 years of policy geared towards surging housing prices which has left people increasingly locked out of the market. And it leaves us with little hope of reversing the trend of declining affordability unless politicians embrace policies that are mostly politically unpalatable. Here is how the Grattan Institute\u2019s John Daley and Brendan Coates summarise the state of housing in Australia: \u201cToday, home ownership largely depends on income, and how wealthy your parents are. Housing is contributing to widening gaps in wealth between rich and poor, old and young. Lower income households are spending more of their income on housing, and are under more rental stress\u201d. But you know, apart from that ... In 2001, the median Sydney house price was 5.8 times the median household income; now it is 8.3 times. In Melbourne the ratio has gone from 4.7 to 7.1. And this issue is not limited to just Sydney and Melbourne \u2013 all regions have seen a massive decrease in affordability: At this point you\u2019re likely to hear those who have owned a house for some time suggest that actually things were tougher in the old days because interest rates were much higher. And yes, they were. Heck, the 1990s and the 17% interest rates were absolute killers (they certainly killed the economy), but that period of horror aside, the cost of paying off a new home loan has stayed around the 25% of household income level for much of the past 30 years: But if housing affordability was mostly about being able to pay off your home loan, then you would not expect to see a drop in the percentage of home owners, and yet there has been \u2013 a massive drop. And the drop is biggest for those younger than 45 \u2013 that is, those who were unable to get into the housing market before affordability really became an issue at the turn of the century: And for those in the housing market, even the low interest rates are not doing much to help out in the long-term \u2013 all it is meaning is that fewer Australians are paying off their mortgage. 20 years ago 68% of households aged 55-64 owned their home outright; now it is just 42%: That has major repercussions given the importance of the family home during retirement. And the issue is not merely linked to age. Income has become a key determinate of housing affordability. The Grattan Institute\u2019s report found that since 1981 the biggest falls in home ownership is among young people and low income earners of all ages: As Daley and Coates note, \u201chome-ownership rates are falling among all Australians younger than 65, especially those with lower incomes\u201d. A big reason affordability has declined so much for lower incomes is because the price of lowest-cost houses and apartments has actually risen the fastest over the past decade. From 2003-04 to 2015-16 the price of the cheapest dwellings has actually risen more than have the most expensive: So what is to blame, and how can it be fixed? The reports notes the issues include both demand and supply. On the demand side there has been in increase in immigration growth over the past 10 years: The report notes that reducing the growth would likely improve affordability. The problem is it would likely be at the cost of reduced living standards. The authors argue that \u201creducing immigration would reduce demand, but it would also reduce economic growth per existing resident\u201d. And this is where demand and supply should link together. The authors note that \u201cfirst-best policy is probably to continue with Australia\u2019s demand-driven, relatively high-skill migration, and to increase supply of housing accordingly\u201d. But the authors are also realists. They note that \u201cAustralia is currently in a world of third-best policy: rapid migration and restricted supply of housing, which is imposing big costs on those who have not already bought housing\u201d. Such is the pathetic state of Australia politics that the authors in effect argue to tackle housing affordability we most likely will need to pursue a policy which they also argue will reduce economic growth. Also on the demand side is negative gearing (which the authors argue should be abolished) and the 50% discount for capital gains tax, which they argue should be halved to 25%. But in our current housing market, removing those two taxation policies would do little to lower housing prices \u2013 reducing them by around 2% compared with what they would be with the current settings in place. The big problem is supply \u2013 Australia has fewer homes per resident than do most advanced economies \u2013 and crucially in the past decade the supply per resident has fallen: And a major reason is Nimbyism \u2013 most people think increasing housing supply is a good idea, they just don\u2019t want it to happen in their neighbourhood, either because of worries about traffic congestion, \u201closs of street appeal\u201d, or they \u201cdon\u2019t want the existing mix of people to change\u201d: Daley and Coates note, with particular and justified cynicism, that because \u201cno single level of government owns the challenge of managing population growth in our biggest cities\u201d it means \u201cno government is responsible for the serious consequences of failing to plan for growing populations\u201d. The consequence of this is that \u201cmore housing will be built on the urban fringe where there are no existing residents to object, but it will be far from jobs and existing infrastructure. And house prices will keep rising\u201d. And such has been the case for 30 years \u2013 to the point now where they note \u201cowning a home increasingly depends on who your parents are\u201d as first-home buyers become more dependent on loans from families and friends: It also means that younger people are taking longer to purchase their first home and thus will be less likely to have paid off their home by the time of retirement: Will it change? Probably not. The authors note that the measures which will have the most impact \u2013 such as increased housing density, capital gains tax on primary residence, abolishing stamp duty, and limiting negative gearing \u2013 have the least political appeal. Whereas measures such a first-home buyer grant, regional housing development, or a tax on empty dwellings are politically palatable, but will have little impact. After 30 years of policy designs to increase housing prices, the housing market is very much in the hands of those who also have the power in the electoral market.",

      "body": "<p>Anyone in the mood for discovering the end result of short-term, politically driven economic policy could do worse than read the Grattan Institute\u2019s latest report on <a href=\"https://grattan.edu.au/report/housing-affordability-re-imagining-the-australian-dream/\">housing affordability</a>. It is a report that shows the result of 30 years of policy geared towards surging housing prices which has left people increasingly locked out of the market. And it leaves us with little hope of reversing the trend of declining affordability unless politicians embrace policies that are mostly politically unpalatable. </p> <p>Here is how the Grattan Institute\u2019s John Daley and Brendan Coates summarise the state of housing in Australia: \u201cToday, home ownership largely depends on income, and how wealthy your parents are. Housing is contributing to widening gaps in wealth between rich and poor, old and young. Lower income households are spending more of their income on housing, and are under more rental stress\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/mar/04/housing-report-says-migration-may-need-to-be-cut-to-preserve-quality-of-life\">Housing report says migration may need to be cut to preserve quality of life</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But you know, apart from that ...</p> <p>In 2001, the median Sydney house price was 5.8 times the median household income; now it is 8.3 times. In Melbourne the ratio has gone from 4.7 to 7.1. And this issue is not limited to just Sydney and Melbourne \u2013 all regions have seen a massive decrease in affordability: </p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Ratio of median dwelling price to median annual gross household income\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/xWQ2S/1/\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" width=\"640\" height=\"351\"></iframe>\u00a0 </figure>  <p>At this point you\u2019re likely to hear those who have owned a house for some time suggest that actually things were tougher in the old days because interest rates were much higher.<br></p> <p>And yes, they were. Heck, the 1990s and the 17% interest rates were absolute killers (they certainly killed the economy), but that period of horror aside, the cost of paying off a new home loan has stayed around the 25% of household income level for much of the past 30 years:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Cost of servicing a new home loan\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/0lcE2/1/\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>But if housing affordability was mostly about being able to pay off your home loan, then you would not expect to see a drop in the percentage of home owners, and yet there has been \u2013 a massive drop. </p> <p>And the drop is biggest for those younger than 45 \u2013 that is, those who were unable to get into the housing market before affordability really became an issue at the turn of the century: </p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Home ownership rate by age\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/446sp/1/\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>And for those in the housing market, even the low interest rates are not doing much to help out in the long-term \u2013 all it is meaning is that fewer Australians are paying off their mortgage. </p> <p>20 years ago 68% of households aged 55-64 owned their home outright; now it is just 42%:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Households that own home outright, by age group\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/FtyzP/1/\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>That has major repercussions given the importance of the family home during retirement.</p> <p>And the issue is not merely linked to age. Income has become a key determinate of housing affordability. The Grattan Institute\u2019s report found that since 1981 the biggest falls in home ownership is among young people and low income earners of all ages:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Change in home ownership rates by age &amp; income, 1981-2016\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/5ah6V/1/\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>As Daley and Coates note, \u201chome-ownership rates are falling among all Australians younger than 65, especially those with lower incomes\u201d. A big reason affordability has declined so much for lower incomes is because the price of lowest-cost houses and apartments has actually risen the fastest over the past decade. </p> <p>From 2003-04 to 2015-16 the price of the cheapest dwellings has actually risen more than have the most expensive: </p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Dwelling price growth 2003-04 to 2015-16, by price decile\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/iuJi3/1/\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>So what is to blame, and how can it be fixed?</p> <p>The reports notes the issues include both demand and supply. </p> <p>On the demand side there has been in increase in immigration growth over the past 10 years: </p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Annual resident population growth\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/Rop9K/1/\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>The report notes that reducing the growth would likely improve affordability. The problem is it would likely be at the cost of reduced living standards.</p> <p>The authors argue that \u201creducing immigration would reduce demand, but it would also reduce economic growth per existing resident\u201d.</p> <p>And this is where demand and supply should link together. The authors note that \u201cfirst-best policy is probably to continue with Australia\u2019s demand-driven, relatively high-skill migration, and to increase supply of housing accordingly\u201d.</p> <p>But the authors are also realists. They note that \u201cAustralia is currently in a world of third-best policy: rapid migration and restricted supply of housing, which is imposing big costs on those who have not already bought housing\u201d. </p> <p>Such is the pathetic state of Australia politics that the authors in effect argue to tackle housing affordability we most likely will need to pursue a policy which they also argue will reduce economic growth. </p> <p>Also on the demand side is negative gearing (which the authors argue should be abolished) and the 50% discount for capital gains tax, which they argue should be halved to 25%.</p> <p>But in our current housing market, removing those two taxation policies would do little to lower housing prices \u2013 reducing them by around 2% compared with what they would be with the current settings in place.</p> <p>The big problem is supply \u2013 Australia has fewer homes per resident than do most advanced economies \u2013 and crucially in the past decade the supply per resident has fallen:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Dwellings per 1000 people\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/v89Yo/1/\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" width=\"640\" height=\"390\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>And a major reason is Nimbyism \u2013 most people think increasing housing supply is a good idea, they just don\u2019t want it to happen in their neighbourhood, either because of worries about traffic congestion, \u201closs of street appeal\u201d, or they \u201cdon\u2019t want the existing mix of people to change\u201d:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Reasons people don't want the population of their neighbourhood to increase\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/dJBRG/2/\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>Daley and Coates note, with particular and justified cynicism, that because \u201cno single level of government owns the challenge of managing population growth in our biggest cities\u201d it means \u201cno government is responsible for the serious consequences of failing to plan for growing populations\u201d.</p> <p>The consequence of this is that \u201cmore housing will be built on the urban fringe where there are no existing residents to object, but it will be far from jobs and existing infrastructure.

Has support for Team Sky only survived this long because the adventure into cycling was a pet project of the chairman, James Murdoch, and the chief executive, Jeremy Darroch? Sky\u2019s role at the cycling team goes deeper than mere sponsorship. The company is also the owner: its shareholding in Tour Racing Limited, the vehicle for Team Sky, is 85%. Darroch and the team principal, Sir Dave Brailsford, have also given joint interviews to the Financial Times in the past, citing the closeness of the team to the company as a factor in sporting success. A picture of Chris Froome winning the Tour de France adorned the cover of the 2016 annual report. There is, so far, no indication that Murdoch, Darroch and Sky are wavering. The company stood firm even when Brailsford said in March last year that \u201cmistakes were made\u201d over how the former rider Sir Bradley Wiggins\u2019 medical treatment was recorded at a 2011 event. Yet the highly serious charge in the report from the digital, culture, media and sport select committee is that Team Sky abandoned its ethos of \u201cwinning clean\u201d and allegedly abused the anti-doping system before the 2012 Tour de France.

Will water regulator turn off the tap of goodwill? Calls from the shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, to renationalise the water industry have been heard by Ofwat. When it hasn\u2019t been calling on companies (belatedly) to close subsidiaries in tax havens, the regulator has been promising to get tough on miscreants who fail customers. Now, with water pipes exploding after the big freeze and rapid thaw, we may find out what the words mean. Ofwat\u2019s new chief executive, Rachel Fletcher, has pointed out that severe weather was forecast but some firms \u201cappear to have fallen well short on their forward planning\u201d. She has promised to intervene if companies did not have \u201cthe right structures and mechanisms\u201d to be resilient. Two big firms\u2019 performance will be examined first, one assumes. Thames Water left 20,000 properties high and dry. Severn Trent has taken the spectacular measure of asking Jaguar Land Rover and Cadbury to close down production temporarily so engineers can more easily fix leaks in the region. Ofwat\u2019s report on the big freeze could be interesting. The main corporate argument against nationalisation is that the state, with pressing calls on its budget from health, welfare and education, would not guarantee the long-term funds still needed to overhaul water infrastructure that, in some cases, still dates from the Victorian era. It\u2019s a reasonable argument, but it is easier for privatised firms to make if they can show they have spent enough and spent wisely. A damning verdict by Ofwat would play terribly in the current climate, especially if the regulator\u2019s lash turns out to be a tickle.

      "bodyText": "Roving jellyfish and seaweed have long been unwanted guests at Scotland\u2019s last two nuclear power stations. Now the marine algae have hit again, forcing one of the plants to partially power down despite freezing temperatures pushing up demand for electricity. During last week\u2019s cold weather, excessive amounts of seaweed entered the cooling system of the Torness plant in East Lothian, causing one reactor to be closed on Thursday. Its owner, EDF Energy, said the measure had been taken due to the \u201crisk of marine ingress\u201d. After several days of reduced output, the power station was gradually returning to full power on Monday. Together with Hunterston on the west coast, the plants normally provide about a third of Scotland\u2019s electricity needs. An EDF spokesperson said: \u201cWe know that at certain times of year particular weather conditions in this part of the Forth estuary can lead to increased seaweed volumes which can enter the station\u2019s cooling water intake system. Our staff are trained to respond in this situation, and to take the plant offline if necessary.\u201d It is not the first time that Torness has been affected by seaborne nuisances. The site was closed twice in 2013 due to seaweed clogging the plant\u2019s cooling system, and jellyfish caused the plant\u2019s units to temporarily shut down in 2011. Torness, which opened in 1988, was scheduled to close in 2023 but two years ago EDF Energy announced it was extending the plant\u2019s lifetime to 2030 to maintain secure electricity supplies. Several of the UK\u2019s other eight remaining nuclear power stations are due to shut earlier, in the 2020s. Heysham nuclear power station in Lancashire and Sizewell B in Suffolk are also running at reduced power, due to planned maintenance. However, during the recent freezing weather, Britain\u2019s nuclear sector has been consistently providing about a fifth of UK electricity supplies. EDF Energy, along with other generators, will have benefited from high power prices in the past few days, a knock-on effect of the extremely strong gas demand for heating. Wholesale electricity prices, which are normally about \u00a345 per megawatt hour, reached spikes of \u00a3990/MWh on Thursday, the coldest spring day on record. Prices remained high on Monday, hitting \u00a3109/MWh in the morning. Analysts ICIS said weekend power prices were roughly double the average seen in 2017. Britain\u2019s rapidly dwindling fleet of coal power stations have surged in the past few weeks, with coal providing a quarter of electricity on Saturday. Experts at Bernstein bank said the \u201cbeast from the east\u201d would have been particularly positive for Drax, which runs a large coal and biomass power station in North Yorkshire. \u2022 This article was amended on 8 March 2018 because an earlier version abbreviated megawatt hour to mWh.",

      "bodyText": "Trinity Mirror is to change its name to Reach following the acquisition of Richard Desmond\u2019s Express and Star titles, as the newspaper publisher reported a slump in revenues in tough trading conditions last year. The chief executive, Simon Fox, said the new name encapsulated the reach its newspaper titles had with readers in print and digital. Fox\u2019s pay packet swelled by 19% to \u00a3893,000 last year, thanks to almost \u00a3300,000 in bonuses and awards. The Trinity Mirror name will be scrapped after almost 20 years if investors vote to approve the change at the publisher\u2019s annual general meeting in May. \u201cWe wanted a simple name, a Ronseal name \u2013 \u2018it does what it says on the tin\u2019 \u2013 that simply describes what we do,\u201d Fox said. \u201cTrinity Mirror came about from the merger of two companies in 1999. Since then we have bought [regional newspaper publisher] Local World and [Express Newspapers owner] Northern and Shell. The old name no longer reflects the composition of the group. We felt it was necessary, out of respect for our new colleagues.\u201d Last week, the competition regulator issued an initial enforcement order to stop Trinity Mirror integrating Express Newspapers while it considers whether to launch a full investigation into the deal. Fox has promised that Desmond\u2019s Brexit-supporting titles will be kept editorially independent from his Labour-supporting Daily Mirror and Sunday Mirror. However, the company announced that it was replacing the editors of the Daily Express and Daily Star, who resigned days after Trinity Mirror shareholders voted to approve the deal. Fox maintained that the Express and Star would \u201cabsolutely\u201d remain independent. \u201cThe Mirror isn\u2019t going rightwing and the Express isn\u2019t going leftwing,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have put in senior, experienced editors who are going to continue to reflect the views of readers. We still have in place the editor of the Sunday Express and all of the editorial team at the Daily Express.\u201d Trinity Mirror reported a 12.6% fall in total revenues to \u00a3632m last year, as the newspaper publishing market continues to struggle. Sales revenue fell by 8.3%, from \u00a3310.6m to \u00a3284.7m, as price rises helped to offset 20% circulation falls at the Daily Mirror and Sunday Mirror. The steep falls are partly down to a decision to remove \u201cbulk\u201d sales \u2013 free copies that are given away in places such as train stations and gyms \u2013 from the figures. Pre-tax profits grew slightly from \u00a376.5m to \u00a381.9m, thanks to a \u00a320m cost-cutting plan that helped push up margins. \u201cWe once again delivered a strong financial performance in what remains a difficult trading environment for the industry,\u201d said Fox. The publisher reported a 25% fall in newspaper print advertising last year, from \u00a3236.6m to \u00a3177.6m, while growth in digital revenue from publishing operations fell far short of target. Digital revenue grew by 7% to \u00a383.9m, accounting for just 13% of total revenues, missing the company\u2019s target of 15% growth per annum. Within this, digital display and transactional revenue grew 18.2%, with the company targeting \u201cat least\u201d 20% growth this year.",

    "webTitle": "Diesel slide continues as UK car sales fall for 11th month running", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Slumping demand for diesel vehicles dragged down new car sales in February, marking the 11th consecutive month of declines for Britain\u2019s new car market. The number of new cars registered dropped 2.8% compared to the same month a year ago to 80,805, according to the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT), the industry trade body. The rate of decline has slowed from the double-digit drops seen at the end of last year. But sales of diesel cars fell by 23.5% to 28,317 last month, reducing their share of the market to 35% from 44.5% a year ago. February is usually a quiet month before the number plate change in March, when around a quarter of all cars are registered each year. Dealers often offer discounts to sell cars with old plates. However, the SMMT is expecting a further year-on-year drop in March, as this time last year buyers were rushing to get their new cars registered before an increase in vehicle excise duty in April 2017. Mike Hawes, the SMMT chief executive, said: \u201cLooking ahead to the crucial number plate change month of March, we expect a further softening, given March 2017 was a record as registrations were pulled forward to avoid VED changes.\u201d The SMMT said the sharp decline in diesel sales suggested owners were keeping their old cars longer. It described the slump in diesel demand as \u201cdisappointing\u201d, given that the \u201clatest cars are the cleanest in history and can help address air quality issues\u201d. Demand for secondhand diesels has also plummeted since the Volkswagen emissions scandal erupted in September 2015. A third of VW cars that were equipped with devices to cheat emissions tests remain unfixed, it emerged in November. Howard Archer, the chief economic adviser to the EY Item Club, said the 11th month of falling car sales pointed to a \u201csustained loss of momentum in the sector\u201d \u2013 indicating that \u201csqueezed, uncertain consumers are still reluctant to make major purchases\u201d. Consumer spending last year likely grew at the slowest rate since 2011, he added. The SMMT figures showed sales of petrol cars rose 14.4% year-on-year in February, taking their market share to 60.6% from 51.5%. Sales were boosted by new smaller models coming on to the market, such as the latest version of the Ford Fiesta and the US carmaker\u2019s new SUV EcoSport. Sales of electric and hybrid vehicles also continued to climb, rising 7.2% in February. So far this year, the UK new car market has declined by 5.1%, with registrations by business, private and fleet buyers all down \u2013 by 29.8%, 7.1% and 2.1% respectively. The new car market declined last year for the first time since 2011, bringing an end to a boom that had been fuelled by cheap finance and personal contract plans (PCP), which now account for more than 80% of all of new car registrations.

      "bodyText": "The steel industry has pointed to Australia\u2019s existing anti-dumping measures as a way to combat the fallout from Donald Trump\u2019s proposed tariffs on steel and aluminium imports, while the Coalition and Labor have raised the prospect of direct trade retaliation. Despite frantic diplomatic efforts to achieve an exemption from the controversial plan to impose tariffs of 25% on steel imports and 10% on imported aluminium, the Turnbull government is increasingly concerned that Australian exports will be hit. The Turnbull government is still awaiting details of the Trump administration\u2019s controversial plan \u2013 announced last week \u2013 despite apparently saying last year that Australia would be exempt from such a plan. The trade minister, Steve Ciobo, warned last week that the tariffs could spark a trade war and lead to global recession, and said Australia reserved the right to doing anything necessary to protect the national interest. The shadow treasurer, Chris Bowen, backed Ciobo on Monday, saying that Labor would support the government if it wanted to pursue retaliatory measures to protect Australia in the event of a trade war. \u201cI think that we should look at all options ... in the national interest,\u201d Bowen told ABC radio. \u201cThe government would have the full support of the Labor party for anything it does to convince the United States, and if that\u2019s not successful then obviously the government would be within its right to consider what comes next. \u201cObviously this is the time for cool heads but it is also a time for governments around the world \u2013 and alternative governments \u2013 to point to dangers of this sort of protectionism and the benefits of trade.\u201d Bowen said Trump\u2019s tariffs risked affecting $240m worth of steel and $70m worth of aluminium Australia exports to the United States, and it could provoke a retaliatory trade war. He said even if Australia got some kind of exemption, there would still be other countries affected by the tariffs that may want to dump their product into Australia, which would damage Australian industry. \u201cSo this is lose, lose, lose,\u201d he said. \u201cThe government would have the full support of the Labor party for anything that they can do to try to get sense to prevail in the United States.\u201d Australia\u2019s steel industry is urging calm, saying the details of Trump\u2019s tariffs were yet to be seen. It said Australia did not know which steel and aluminium products would be affected yet, and there was a diverse list of potential items that could be affected, from aluminium lolly wrappers to sheets of steel. The chief executive of the Australian Steel Institute, Tony Dixon, said it was too early to say how the government should respond because the details were unknown. But he also said Australia\u2019s domestic market ought to be protected, and there were \u201cways to manage that\u201d by using World Trade Organisation provisions for anti-dumping legislation. \u201cWe need to wait until the air clears a little bit, with more information coming out of the minister\u2019s office or from the Department of Trade, hopefully over the next week,\u201d Dixon told Guardian Australia. \u201cWe would hope at the end of the day for a bipartisan response ... a cool and sensible response. It\u2019s not going to be in the best interests of anyone to begin a trade war.\u201d His view was supported by the CEO of the Australian Steel Association, David Birrell, who said Australia was a proponent of free and open trade and it had \u201csignificant trade remedy measures\u201d that already applied through the Anti-Dumping Commission. \u201cThe fundamental issue here is if you apply tariffs to manufacturing inputs, all you do is make manufacturing costs higher,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are believers in free trade and any increase in input costs [from tariffs] works against WTO principles.\u201d On Monday, the ABC reported that Trump had \u201cemphatically promised\u201d to exempt Australian steel and aluminium products from any tariffs when he met with Turnbull mid-way through last year, and the promise was witnessed by the US treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, the US commerce secretary, Wilbur Ross, the White House chief economics adviser, Gary Cohn, Australia\u2019s finance minister, Mathias Cormann, and Australia\u2019s deputy secretary of the department of prime minister and cabinet, David Gruen. After that meeting last year, Cormann said Australian officials had impressed upon Trump the importance of exempting Australia from any tariffs, and Trump had understood. Ciobo is on his way to Chile to sign the renegotiated 11-country Trans-Pacific Partnership on Thursday and his office told Guardian Australia that it had no update on Trump\u2019s plan. \u201cAn announcement from the Trump administration that ensures Australia\u2019s steel and aluminium exports to the United States can continue unaffected would be welcome and good for Australian and American jobs,\u201d Ciobo said. \u201cHowever, at this stage, Australia, like the rest of the world, is awaiting clarity to see how we will be affected.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Britain\u2019s manufacturers are set to outpace the rest of the economy this year with help from booming global demand for exports, according to a survey showing British firms started the year on a strong note. According to the manufacturers\u2019 organisation EEF and the accountancy firm BDO, factory output is on course to increase by 2% this year \u2013 beating the 1.5% GDP growth forecast for the wider economy. There have been fears over slowing activity in the manufacturing sector in recent weeks as concerns mount over Brexit and the value of the pound. But the EEF and BDO said factory output and total orders had remained in \u201cvery positive territory\u201d at the start of the year. The survey of 378 firms found two-thirds of manufacturers see the European Union as offering good prospects for growth, with the \u201cnext best\u201d markets of Asia and North America seen as supportive by about a quarter of companies. The snapshot of the manufacturing sector, which makes up about 10% of the UK economy, showed a balance of +30% of survey respondents reporting an increase in output and total orders for the first three months of 2018. Although that was slightly down from the +34% recorded for the previous quarter, the EEF said it represented a reading above the long-run average in the survey. Lee Hopley, the chief economist at the EEF, said: \u201cThe importance of a buoyant global economy to export-focused manufacturing sectors is again reinforced, with growing overseas demand.\u201d The survey showed manufacturers were planning to increase recruitment and investment as a result of the positive global economic condition, though it also warned that firms did not appear keen to invest heavily considering the high level of uncertainty surrounding Brexit. The reading will prove positive at the start of National Apprenticeship Week in the UK, even though there are fresh doubts that a government target to enlist 3 million new apprentices by 2020 will be met. A survey of 1,640 business executives by the Chartered Management Institute found almost half do not believe the target will be reached. The government said in response that it was still committed to its targets.",

      "bodyText": "Ofgem is to formally ban gas and electricity suppliers from issuing customers with back-bills for energy used more than 12 months ago. Most of the big suppliers are bound by a voluntary agreement that prevents them chasing a domestic customer for energy supplied more than a year ago. After a consultation, the energy regulator has banned all suppliers from back-billing, where the consumer has provided meter readings and acted in good faith. The ban, which also covers small businesses, does not come into effect until early May. Most billing problems stem from issues with a supplier\u2019s billing system, or because the meter used is not correctly registered at the customer\u2019s address. In the face of such problems, suppliers will estimate bills until they have an actual meter reading that may show that the customer\u2019s consumption is higher than expected. Suppliers then send a \u201ccatch-up\u201d bill to recover the difference. In other cases, customers have not received bills in 20 years. Ofgem said the typical back-bill was \u00a31,160, but they can be much higher, leaving customers struggling financially or even in debt, and can cause stress. Consumers who actively prevent suppliers from taking or receiving accurate meter readings will not gain this benefit, the regulator said. As smart meters are rolled out across the UK, suppliers will no longer need to rely on estimated bills and send catch-up bills to customers. Suppliers have obligations to make sure they use the technology, to provide accurate billing. Rob Salter-Church, Ofgem\u2019s interim senior partner for consumers and competition, said: \u201cGetting billing right is an essential part of customer service, and it\u2019s unfair that consumers should be left out of pocket when through no fault of their own they\u2019re issued with a shock bill from their supplier.\u201d Victoria MacGregor, the director of energy at Citizens Advice, said: \u201cPreviously we\u2019ve seen evidence of suppliers trying to game the rules by blaming customers for billing errors, cases where suppliers have ignored their commitments entirely.\u201d Lawrence Slade, the chief executive of Energy UK, said: \u201cEnergy companies take accurate billing very seriously and where there are problems, the majority are resolved within 24 hours.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "One in three of the UK\u2019s top 100 restaurant groups are lossmaking, a rise of 75% in the past year as the casual dining crunch continues with little respite in sight, according to a study. A combination of higher staff costs, rising business rates and falling consumer confidence have conspired to slash profit margins and force high street closures. The accountancy group UHY Hacker Young, which conducted the study, said oversaturation in the market was also a significant factor. The mid-market chains Jamie\u2019s Italian, Prezzo and Strada are among the restaurants to have announced recent closures. Peter Kubik, a partner at UHY Hacker Young, said: \u201cMore than a third of the biggest companies in the restaurant sector are losing money, and there is little respite on the horizon. \u201cPressures on the restaurant sector have been building for years, and the last year has pushed a number of major groups to breaking point. With Brexit hanging over consumers like a dark cloud, restaurants can\u2019t expect a bailout from a surge in discretionary spending. \u201cConsumers only have a finite amount of spending power when it comes to eating out, and the oversaturation of the market means that groups that fall foul of changing trends can very easily fail. \u201cThe government has ratcheted up costs with a series of above-inflation rises in the minimum wage and we are just weeks away from another 4.4% rise in April. That will be tough for a lot of restaurants to absorb.\u201d Many mid-market chains face challenges. The Italian restaurant chain Prezzo last week announced plans to close about a third of its outlets \u2013 94 restaurants including all 33 in its Tex-Mex chain Chimichanga \u2013 in an attempt to rescue the business. The chain, owned by the private equity firm TPG Capital, employs about 4,500 people. Earlier this year the Jamie Oliver Restaurant Group announced it was shutting 12 of its 37 remaining Jamie\u2019s Italian restaurants, affecting at least 200 jobs \u2013 after having closed six outlets the previous year. Oliver\u2019s Barbecoa steakhouses went into administration last month. Also in January, the burger chain Byron agreed a rescue plan that could lead to the closure of up to 20 restaurants, the Italian chain Strada announced plans to close 10 sites and Square Pie, the gourmet pie and mash chain, went into administration. Rising food costs, exacerbated by a weaker pound following the EU referendum, and increased competition from supermarkets were also possible factors. In a recent report, the business consultancy Deloitte said that although casual dining operators faced challenging times ahead, changes in consumer tastes and the way diners engaged with restaurants, particularly through technology, could provide opportunities for growth. Key consumer trends included more healthy eating, informal and experiential dining and increased consumer focus on food provenance and sustainability, it said. Customers wanted to dine on their terms, and it was essential restaurateurs optimised \u201clocation\u201d and \u201coccasion\u201d, the report said. It noted home delivery in Britain was growing 10 times faster than the total eating-out market. Stefan Chomka, editor of Restaurant magazine, said the huge growth in the casual dining market has led to too many restaurants at the same time as food costs, staff costs, rents and business rates have all gone up. \u201cIf you\u2019re operating 100 sites, your margins are being squeezed and squeezed. And times are tough,\u201d he told the Guardian last month. \u201cEven if they spend a little more when they do, people are eating out less often. So there are greater costs, more competition, fewer people and, consequently, the shit is hitting the fan.\u201d It is not just mid-market chains that are likely to be affected by the rise of the national living wage by 33p an hour to \u00a37.83 from 1 April, and other factors. This week bosses at Heston Blumenthal\u2019s celebrated Fat Duck, the three Michelin-starred eatery in Bray, Berkshire, where diners expect to pay upwards of \u00a3325 a head, acknowledged the potential impact on profit margins. The restaurant\u2019s director, Peter Moody, told the Mail on Sunday: \u201cWe are aware of the threat to the company\u2019s future profitability that is posed by current global uncertainty, national living wage increases and supplier price inflation.\u201d",
