      "bodyText": "It\u2019s still early days in the great Volkswagen emissions scandal but, even at this stage, shocked shareholders \u2013 not to mention the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, US regulators and customers \u2013 would surely have expected to hear something more substantial from the company\u2019s top brass than various refrains of \u201cwe totally screwed up\u201d. Those words came from the company\u2019s US boss. Back in Europe, the chief executive Martin Winterkorn\u2019s version was that Volkswagen \u201cbetrayed the trust\u201d of millions of people and no stone will be left unturned to discover what went wrong. And, by the way, nobody is resigning \u2013 at least not yet. This response is feeble. A third of the company\u2019s stock market value has evaporated in two days and a \u20ac6.5bn (\u00a34.7bn) charge will be allocated \u201cto cover the necessary service measures and other efforts to win back the trust of customers\u201d. That sum will look small once US regulators and lawyers sink their teeth into the company. Then, in the long term, there is a challenge to keep diesel engines on the road. Thus it is surely impossible for Winterkorn to survive this scandal. If he knew the company had installed software to cheat US emissions tests, the end of his business career will be the least of his problems. If he didn\u2019t know, he\u2019s failed to do his job properly. Either way, he should have resigned from a well-paid post he has held since 2007. It\u2019s also astonishing that Volkswagen\u2019s supervisory board didn\u2019t insist on an immediate resignation. If this was a UK-listed company \u2013 a leading member of the FTSE 100 index \u2013 it is safe to say the chief executive would have received his marching orders on day one. \u201cWe will do everything necessary to reverse the damage this has caused,\u201d says Winterkorn. Come on, when the corporate crash is this severe, the minimum requirement is a new driver. The City doesn\u2019t know what to make of Glencore\u2019s plans Tough luck if you joined Ivan Glasenberg and chums in buying a few Glencore shares in last week\u2019s \u00a31.6bn placing: you\u2019re down 15% on your investment already. A slip in the price of copper, coupled with more cool breezes out of China, has put another dent in the company\u2019s value. If, like Glasenberg, you\u2019re an optimist, you might congratulate yourself on the brilliance of the timing of your cash-call. At last week\u2019s 125p, \u00a31.6bn arrived by issuing 9.99% more shares, the maximum allowed without triggering shareholders\u2019 pre-emption rights. The arithmetic of a placing wouldn\u2019t have worked at today\u2019s 106p \u2013 to get \u00a31.6bn, a time-consuming rights issue would have been required. In reality, Glencore should have raised more money earlier when it had the chance. If you\u2019ve got a problem with your balance sheet, go early, investment bankers usually advise. Back in June, when cracks started to appear in China\u2019s growth story, Glencore traded at 270p. A rights issue at that stage to raise, say, \u00a35bn would have shocked shareholders but would be seen now as a prudent piece of planning. As it is, the City still doesn\u2019t know what to make of Glencore\u2019s plans to cut its $30bn (\u00a322bn) debt pile. Last week\u2019s small fundraising is clearly a step in the right direction but earnings are a prisoner of the copper price in the short term. Morgan Stanley analysts last week concluded the shares are worth 325p under a bullish scenario but their bear case produced a value of just 17p. \u201cFinancial leverage drives a wide range of outcomes,\u201d they said. You bet. If the disposals appear on time, and if the trading division delivers the promised earnings of $2.5bn-plus this year, confidence could return quickly. In that case, Glasenberg\u2019s decision to opt for a bare-minimum \u00a31.6bn fundraising will be seen as a gamble that paid off. But let\u2019s be clear: some of us are obliged to own Glencore stock via our company pension schemes, and we would expect the chairman, Tony Hayward, to remind Glasenberg that not everybody shares his appetite for risk. Do those conversations even take place? Hillary Clinton\u2019s medicine might just work US politicians have promised so many times over the years to bring down the cost of prescription medicines that presidential hopeful Hillary Clinton\u2019s declaration of war against \u201cprice gouging\u201d should be treated cautiously. Never underestimate the power of the drug companies lobby. On the other hand, there\u2019s nothing like a clear example of abuse to change the political climate \u2013 and Turing Pharmaceuticals\u2019 decision to increase the price of a drug used by HIV patients from $13.50 a pill to $750 might be it. The fact that Turing is run by an ex-hedge fund manager adds to the potential for Clinton to make waves. This story could yet develop.",

This is the backdrop against which an esteemed global manufacturer, and emblem of Germany\u2019s purposefully productive capitalism, has been caught doing something that would make the most shameless banker blush. Volkswagen has been applying the technical acumen for which it is so admired to the task of tripping up the American regulators that are tasked with protecting the air that citizens breathe.

Figuratively, it is every bit as breathtaking, too \u2013 with the twist that, thanks to the effect of nitrogen oxides on respiration, it could also play havoc with literal breathing. This tale is a rude reminder that commercial skulduggery is not the exclusive preserve of finance. The most immediate implications are for the German company itself. Half a million vehicles were immediately recalled in the US, each potentially incurring a fine of up to $37,500, implying a theoretical maximum bill of $18bn-plus. And that\u2019s before we get on to knock-on costs of compensating consumers, litigation and damage to a powerful brand that is built on reliability, not to mention another 10.5m vehicles worldwide, which VW conceded today could also end up being caught up in the scandal.

The tobacco sector has a long and shaming history of damaging lungs while concealing the evidence; any motor manufacturers who have been doing something can expect to face similar disgrace.

If the mismeasurement of pollution is so easily contrived, there will be political as well as commercial imperatives to distort. Boris Johnson didn\u2019t need devious software to spray water around at those points in London where European monitors measure pollution, a bizarre distraction from tackling air quality across the city as a whole.

      "bodyText": "Volkswagen has admitted that 11 million of its cars worldwide were designed to cheat emissions testing, in an escalating scandal that has loaded pressure on the wider motor industry. Campaigners have long claimed engine emissions figures under laboratory tests are far exceeded in real-life conditions, and experts have said thousands of premature deaths could be averted by ensuring cars meet their legal limits. The German carmaker\u2019s chief executive apologised but remained in his post on Tuesday, despite its shares slumping and government calls for a European commission inquiry, in what analysts described as a Libor moment for the motor industry. VW revealed that it had put aside \u20ac6.5bn (\u00a34.7bn) to deal with the potential costs of the crisis, although it could still face fines of up to $18bn in a criminal investigation in the US, as well as possible charges for its executives and legal action from customers and shareholders. The US justice department has reportedly already begun an investigation into the alleged cheating. The House oversight and investigations subcommittee announced Monday it planned to hold a hearing in coming weeks and New York attorney general Eric Schneiderman has his own investigation underway. \u201cNo company should be allowed to evade our environmental laws or promise consumers a fake bill of goods,\u201d he said in a statement. Volkswagen recalled 482,000 VW and Audi brand cars in the US after the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) found models with Type EA 189 engines had been fitted with a device designed to reduce emissions of nitrogen oxides (NOx) under testing conditions. The company\u2019s chief executive, Martin Winterkorn, defied claims he would be forced out, releasing a video statement saying he was \u201cendlessly sorry we betrayed the trust of customers\u201d. He pledged: \u201cWe are going to clarify the background unsparingly, and at this very moment, everything is being put on the table as quickly, thoroughly and transparently as possible.\u201d He added: \u201cThe irregularities with these engines contradict everything for which Volkswagen stands. To make it very clear: manipulation at VW must never happen again.\u201d About \u20ac25bn, or a third, has now been wiped off the value of Volkswagen\u2019s shares in the two days of trading since the scandal erupted. Shares in other car makers have also fallen heavily, with Peugeot down 7%, BMW down 5% and Daimler, the owner of Mercedes-Benz, also down 5%. German chancellor Angela Merkel demanded \u201ccomplete transparency\u201d from Volkswagen to clear up the crisis. Her transport ministry is sending a fact-finding team to examine if the vehicles were built and tested according to German and European rules. Britain and France called for a European inquiry into the motor industry\u2019s testing. Transport secretary, Patrick McLoughlin, said: \u201cWe are closely monitoring the situation and have been pushing for action at a European level for more accurate tests that reflect driving on the road. \u201cIt\u2019s vital that the public has confidence in vehicle emissions tests and I am calling for the European Commission to investigate this issue as a matter of urgency.\u201d About one-in-10 new cars sold worldwide is a Volkswagen. With the other brands in its group, including Audi, Seat and Skoda, VW manufactured one-in-five new cars sold in the UK last year. The vehicles identified in the US under the EPA investigation included the Audi A3 and the Golf \u2013 two of the top 10 bestselling car models in the UK. The Italian government has launched its own investigation into VW\u2019s emissions testing regime, while the French carmakers association backed a call by the finance minister Michel Sapin for a broad inquiry into the industry, saying it would \u201cconfirm that French manufacturers respect all test proceedings existing in all the countries where they operate.\u201d However, a commission spokesman said it was \u201cpremature to comment\u201d on whether the EC should investigate. British carmakers said that there was no evidence of manufacturers attempting to cheat the European system, but agreed that the system of testing needed reform. Mike Hawes, the chief executive of the UK Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders, said: \u201cThe EU operates a fundamentally different system to the US, with all European tests performed in strict conditions as required by EU law and witnessed by a government-appointed independent approval agency. There is no evidence that manufacturers cheat the cycle. Vehicles are removed from the production line randomly and must be standard production models, certified by the relevant authority \u2013 the UK body being the Vehicle Certification Agency, which is responsible to the Department for Transport. \u201cThe industry acknowledges, however, that the current test method is outdated and is seeking agreement from the European Commission for a new emissions test that embraces new testing technologies and is more representative of on-road conditions.\u201d But campaigners claim that, even without such brazen \u201cdefeat devices\u201d installed, the testing system is not fit for purpose. A Brussels-based group, Transport &amp; Environment, said millions of cars exceed the legal limits. Jos Dings said: \u201cOur latest report demonstrated that almost 90% of diesel vehicles didn\u2019t meet emission limits when they drive on the road. We are talking millions of vehicles.\u201d The rigging of emissions tests may have added nearly a million tonnes of air pollution by VW cars annually \u2013 roughly the same as the UK\u2019s combined emissions for all power stations, vehicles, industry and agriculture. According to a Guardian analysis, the 482,000 non-compliant US vehicles would have released between 10,392 and 41,571 tonnes of NOx annually at an average US mileage, rather than the 1,039 tonnes the EPA standards would imply. Scaled to the 11m global vehicles, that would mean up to 948,691 tonnes of NOx emissions annually. Western Europe\u2019s biggest power station, Drax in the UK, emits 39,000 tonnes of NOx each year. The findings will give fresh urgency to calls to clamp down on diesel vehicles. Despite moves to make diesel engines cleaner, with a new Euro 6 standard implemented for new vehicles claimed to reduce emissions by 90% compared to the oldest cars, the VW scandal will further undermine trust in diesel as air quality worsens. An ultra-low emissions zone planned for London, whose NO2 levels are the highest in the country, will not come into effect until at least 2020. Professor Martin Williams at King\u2019s College London said that emissions from diesel cars cause roughly 5,800 premature deaths in the UK each year. \u201cIf you were to make the cars emit at the legal limit you could reduce those deaths by at least a factor of two and maybe more. Maybe a factor of five.\u201d Catherine Bearder MEP, a lead negotiator on the EU\u2019s new air quality laws, said: \u201cManufacturers in the US have been caught out, but we know that pollution limits are also being breached in Europe ... Unless we take action, thousands of lives will continue to be tragically cut short by air pollution.\u201d Consumer groups said that they believed there were issues with testing beyond NOx pollution. BEUC, the European consumer organisation, said: \u201cThe VW scandal has compounded our concern that underhand tactics are also being used in fuel consumption and CO2 testing programmes in Europe.\u201d Steve Gooding director of the RAC Foundation, said: \u201cDiesel technology has certainly improved over recent years but the question is: by exactly how much? This fiasco shows how urgently an overhaul of testing is needed if trust is to be restored.\u201d City firm Bernstein predicted that the scandal could be the beginning of the end for diesel cars in Europe. Analyst Max Warburton said that the VW revelations would hasten the tightening rules on NOx and particulate emissions and make the cars uncompetitive: \u201cRegulators will now be much more conservative about what they permit and much tougher real world tests may prove either too difficult \u2013 or too expensive \u2013 for diesel to meet.\u201d While the effects on British motor manufacturing, which was led by tax incentives to promote diesel as the government tried to meet CO2 emissions targets from Kyoto, would be substantial, campaigners for clean air would welcome the quicker elimination of diesel. Despite the scandal having broken in the US, only around 3% of passenger cars there use diesel, compared with almost half in the EU.",

      "bodyText": "Renewed alarm about the fragile state of China\u2019s economy sent mining stocks plunging and wiped \u00a344bn off the value of Britain\u2019s top companies on a day of tumultuous trading in financial markets. Mining shares bore the brunt of the selling, with commodity companies making up five of the top 10 fallers in the FTSE 100, which closed 3% lower, some 172.87 points, at 5935.84. Glencore fell to its lowest level since it floated at 530p a share in 2011, down to 99.5p, before recovering to 106.35p, still down nearly 11% on the day. Oil prices also fell sharply, with the cost of a barrel of Brent crude declining 1.7% on Tuesday, to trade at $48 a barrel. The FTSE 100 finished at its lowest level since 24 August, and the biggest one day percentage fall since 1 September. \u201cIt has been another dramatic day on the markets, which has seen the FTSE 100 index sinking below 6,000 points yet again and commodity shares taking a particularly bloody pounding,\u201d said Jason Hollands, managing director of City investment firm Tilney Bestinvest. The fresh outbreak of anxiety came as traders struggled to digest the implications of the crisis at carmaker Volkswagen, which admitted to installing software in 11m cars to baffle US emissions tests. Volkswagen\u2019s share price was down another 16% on Tuesday, after losing 17% on Monday. A downbeat forecast from anti-poverty lender the Asian Development Bank appeared to trigger the latest China panic, after it cut growth projections for the country this year from 7.2% to 6.8%, and downgraded its expectations for a swath of other Asian economies. The focus on China, whose relentless demand for resources over the past decade has buoyed economic growth across commodity-exporting countries, was echoed by International Monetary Fund managing director Christine Lagarde. She told an audience at Washington thinktank the Brookings Institution on Tuesdat that the threats to global economic growth have increased. \u201cThe downside risks are greater than they were,\u201d she said, singling out China and commodity prices as among the looming dangers. Commodity-exporters have already been hit hard in recent months, with Canada and Brazil in recession, and Australia, which has boomed on the back of China\u2019s appetite for iron ore and coal, slowing sharply. Such was the selling pressure on Glencore that its shares were suspended twice during the day, at 8.56am and at 1.22pm, when a single order would have put the share price down by 3% or more, according to the London Stock Exchange. Glencore\u2019s relentless share price slide followed its \u00a31.6bn fundraising last week, which was priced at 125p a share. Chief executive Ivan Glasenberg backed the refinancing with almost \u00a3140m of his own money, but is now sitting on a \u00a320m loss on last week\u2019s investment. In total Glasenberg owns 8.42% of the company. Other fallers included Chilean copper miner Antofagasta, down 41p at 524.5p and Anglo American, 46.8p lower at 648.1p. BHP Billiton was off 54.5p at 1021.5p. There was only one riser in the leading index after RSA Insurance added 2.9p to 406.2p, recovering slightly from Monday\u2019s fall which had been prompted by the news that a planned takeover by rival Zurich had fallen through. China\u2019s troubles have grabbed investors\u2019 attention since US Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen blamed the turmoil in emerging markets, and China in particular, for the decision to postpone a long-planned interest rate rise last week. In the US the Dow Jones industrial average was down by 256 points, or 1.6%, by midday in New York, at 16,251. Pharmaceutical firms were hit hard, after Democratic presidential contender Hillary Clinton pledged to fight eye-watering drugs charges. Fears of a slump in demand has pushed metal prices sharply lower in recent months, with copper around 18% lower than its 2015 peak, prompting companies to start cutting production. Meanwhile European coal prices have dropped 26% so far this year to a record low. Economic policy will be under discussion during this week\u2019s state visit to Washington by Chinese president, Xi Jinping, with many voices in the US critical of Beijing\u2019s currency devaluation in August, and what some saw as the botched attempts to prop up share prices. White House chief economist Jason Furman told Reuters: \u201cYou need to not be doing quick fixes in terms of using your exchange rate or exports.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "VW chief executive Martin Winterkorn has not resigned despite the pressure on him after the emissions scandal, but his fate will be decided when the car maker\u2019s board meet on Wednesday. And as we reported earlier, workers representatives on the supervisory board are keen that there are \u201cpersonnel consequences\u201d and not just among the rank and file. So despite his profuse apologies, Winterkorn may yet be one of those \u201cconsequences.\u201d On that note, it\u2019s time to close up for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. US state attorneys general are forming a committee to probe Volkswagen over the emmissions scandal, Reuters reports quoting the New York attorney general Eric Schneiderman. Away from VW for the moment, and over in Greece it looks like former finance minister Euclid Tsakalotos will take that post in the new cabinet, set to be announced later, despite suggestions earlier he may have been reluctant. Helena Smith reports: The Oxford-educated academic will head the ministry; Giorgos Stathakis who was also at the national economy ministry will return to his post. But perhaps the toughest job will fall to another British-trained academic, the current interim finance minister Giorgos Houliarakis. Houliarakis will be elevated to the top post of a new ministry created with the express purpose of coordinating all the government departments that will be enforcing the internationally mandated fiscal consolidation policies and structural reforms. The state-run TV channel said at least six other ministers would return to their previous posts, including the foreign minister Nikos Kotzias, the health minister Panagiotis Kouromblis, the justice minister Nikos Paraskeuopoulos and Panos Kammenos who is also head of the leftists\u2019 junior partner in government, the small right-wing, nationalist Independent Greeks party. Yiannis Mouzalas is expected to be reappointed as migration minister. Volkswagen shares have closed down 19.82% at \u20ac106, meaning some \u20ac26bn or so has been wiped off the value of the German carmaker this week. The weakness in the motor sector came as investors feared the emissions scandal could spread beyond VW, and was one factor in a worldwide market slump. But it was commodity companies which were the main reason behind the global falls, as base metal, coal and oil prices continued to weaken on fears of slowing worldwide demand, particularly in China. So the final scores showed: The FTSE 100 fell 172.87 points or 2.83% to 5935.84, its lowest level since 24 August Germany\u2019s Dax dropped 3.8% to 9570.66 France\u2019s Cac closed down 3.42% at4428.51 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB finished down 3.33% at 21,031.8 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended 3.11% lower at 9550.2 In Greece, the Athens market lost 2.32% to 677.47 On Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently nearly 270 points or 1.6% lower. Professor David Bailey of Aston Business School says it is \u201cseriously dumb\u201d to try and cheat a regulator and discusses whether Volkswagen could also be cheating in Europe: Here\u2019s Winterkorn\u2019s statement, courtesy of Die Welt and Google Translate: \u201cLadies and gentlemen, the irregularities in diesel engines of our group contradict everything which Volkswagen stands for. Also I have not yet got the answers to all these questions at the moment. But we are about to uncover the background relentlessly. In addition at this time we will put everything on the table - as quickly, thoroughly and transparently as possible. And we will continue to work closely with the relevant state agencies and authorities. This quick and comprehensive information is a top priority. We owe that to our customers, our employees and the public. And to put it bluntly: manipulation at Volkswagen must never happen again. Ladies and gentlemen, many millions of people around the world trust our brands, our cars and our technologies. I\u2019m so sorry that we have broken this trust. I apologize to our customers... and the general public for the misconduct. Please believe me, we will do everything possible to make amends for any damage. And we will do everything to regain your confidence step by step. In our group, more than 600,000 people are working to build the best cars for our customers. To our employees, I say, I know with how much effort and great real sincerity they do their work day after day. I am well aware that much is now questioned. I understand that. But it would be wrong if the hard and honest work of 600,000 people comes general suspicion because of the bad mistakes of a few. Our team does not deserve this. So we ask, I ask for your trust on our journey....We are working intensively on the necessary technical solutions, and we will do everything possible to prevent harm to our customers and employees. I give you my word, in all of this, we will proceed with the utmost openness and transparency. \u201c Winterkorn said he was sorry \u201cwe betrayed the trust\u201d of millions of people. He added: \u201cSwift and comprehensive clarification has now the utmost priority. To make it very clear: manipulation at VW must never happen again.\u201d VW chief executive Martin Winterkorn has apologised for the company\u2019s misconduct, in his video statement which is now on the company\u2019s website. But it appears he intends to fight to keep his job. Workers\u2019 representatives on Volkswagen\u2019s supervisory board will push for management changes after the emissions scandal, council chief Bernd Osterloh told employees. In a letter obtained by German newspaper Bild and reported by Reuters, he said: I can assure you that we will do everything possible in the supervisory board meetings this week to ensure the matter is cleared up quickly and that personnel consequences are drawn. And that will not just affect the rank and file, I can assure you. Germany\u2019s transport ministry is sending a fact-finding committee to Volkswagen this week to investigate the emissions scandal, Reuters is reporting. In a statement the ministry said: Our committee will examine whether the vehicles in question were built and tested according to Germany and European rules, and whether that was done in accordance with vehicle registrations. Volkswagen has said it will post a video statement by chief executive Martin Winterkorn on its website at 15.00 GMT (16.00 BST). Earlier the company denied reports he would be replaced by Porsche\u2019s Matthias M\u00fcller. Eurozone consumer confidence has come in worse than expected for September at 7.1, compared to the 6.8 than analysts had been forecasting. And that is even before the Volkswagen scandal had emerged. US markets have joined in the general rout, with falling commodity prices and the VW scandal sending investors heading for the exits. The Dow Jones Industrial Average has dropped more than 200 points in early trading. In the S&amp;P 500, which is down 1%, Ford has lost 2.8% and General Motors is down 2.9%. In Europe, Germany\u2019s Dax is now down 2.7% with Volkswagen off 17.5%. France\u2019s Cac is currently down 2.8% while the FTSE 100 has fallen 2%. UK Transport Secretary, Patrick McLoughlin, has confirmed that he\u2019s calling for an EU-wide investigation. Here\u2019s the official statement: \u201cWe are closely monitoring the situation and have been pushing for action at a European level for more accurate tests that reflect driving on the road. It\u2019s vital that the public has confidence in vehicle emissions tests and I am calling for the European Commission to investigate this issue as a matter of urgency.\u201d Earlier today, a Commission spokesman said it was \u201cpremature to comment\u201d on whether the EC should launch a probe. \u201cInvestigations are ongoing within Volkswagen as well as in the U.S. and in Germany. Therefore, it is premature to comment on whether any specific immediate surveillance measures are also necessary in Europe and whether vehicles sold by Volkswagen inEurope are also affected. The fallout from the VW scandal continues. Johnson Matthey, which makes catalytic converters, has fallen nearly 7%, while US-Italian carmaker Fiat Chrysler has said it does not use any defeat devices in its vehicles. Fiat Chrysler says it is working closely with the US authorities to make sure its vehicles are compliant with the appropriate requirements. Volkswagen is currently down nearly 19%, mining group Glencore is down 12% at 104p and well below the 125p level of last week\u2019s fundraising as the commodity sell-off continues. And Sainsbury is 0.5% lower. The economics editor of German newspaper Die Welt has warned that Volkswagen is now under attack from all sides, and asked whether the emissions crisis could bring down the company. Nikolaus Doll says that the scandal has reached a dimension that could threaten the existence of the automaker, given the costs and penalties ahead. He cites the huge cost of replacing software in the cars affected, and the threat of class actions from customers affected. More here. Here\u2019s a quick recap of how the crisis gripping Volkswagen has deepened today. VW has admitted that 11m vehicles worldwide have been fitted with a defeat device designed to cheat emissions tests. It has set aside \u20ac6.5bn (\u00a34.7bn) to deal with the potential costs of the crisis, the first estimate of the financial cost, but this could increase as the investigation continues. VW\u2019s share price has tumbled again today, currently down 19%, and the cost of insuring its debt against default has jumped. The German government is now taking a close interest, with chancellor Angela Merkel demanding transparency. The company has denied reports that CEO Martin Winterhorn will be forced out this week, to be replaced by Porsche\u2019s boss Matthias M\u00fcller. Saxo Bank has warned that the full scale of the crisis is impossible to quantify. And City firm Bernstein has predicted that the scandal could scupper the diesel car industry. Here\u2019s our latest story: Angela Merkel has demanded full answers to what went wrong at the country\u2019s largest carmaker. Speaking in Berlin, the German chancellor called for full transparency in clearing up the situation of how Volkswagen rigged emission tests. Merkel, who met with Finland\u2019s PM Juha Sipila today, told reporters: \u201cGiven the difficult situation, this is about showing complete transparency, clearing up the entire case. The Transport Minister is in close contact with the company, Volkswagen. And I hope that the facts will be put on the table as quickly as possible.\u201d Volkswagen is a totem of German industry, having been created in the 1930s to build an affordable family car for the people. Today, it employes more than half a million people worldwide, across divisions including Audi, Bentley, Seat and Lamborghini as well as the VW marque. This Reuters graphic explains how VW\u2019s software detected whether a car was being tested, and changed the level of nitrogen oxide gases pumped out. Bernstein\u2019s Max Warburton also believes that Volkswagen management changes are inevitable. Any attempt to pin the blame on junior staff will flounder, he says. The buck must stop with CEO Martin Winterkorn. Warburton writes: VW\u2019s press release and comments since have suggested they may end up trying to blame someone at the operational and engineering level \u2013 all this talk of \u201cnot tolerating\u201d this behaviour and hiring external investigators suggests as much. Perhaps it is credible that some engineers came up with a solution and senior management was not aware of it. VW has over 450,000 employees \u2013 it\u2019s not possible to track their actions closely. I have enough trouble tracking what my small team of associates is up to. I\u2019ve no idea what my kids are up to right now (it may involve writing computer code too). So we probably need to give VW management a bit of a break, Warburton continues. But if any CEO should have spotted this scandal, it\u2019s Martin Winterkorn ... Winterkorn\u2019s personal brand has been built on being \u201cthe engineer\u2019s engineer\u201d and the \u201cdetail main\u201d. There are wonderful stories of him personally pulling apart the gearbox of an Audi car at Le Mans after it broke and figuring out personally what went wrong (source: Allan McNish, racing driver). We are not talking about the CEO of a French OEM, schooled at ENA. We are not talking about a US executive with an MBA and great smile. This is an engineer, who theoretically should have asked questions about how VW suddenly improved its NOx emissions to meet Californian standards. But then we probably should have asked the question too\u2026 Here\u2019s a summary of Warburton\u2019s research note: Might VW have been doing something similar in Europe \u2013 YES, possibly \u2013 but we would NOT expect fines, only scrutiny and tighter regulations Will other manufacturers be affected in Europe \u2013 YES, no fines but tighter regulations, Are other manufacturers using similar tricks in the US \u2013 NO, but it\u2019s still a risk, Could VW be affected in China too \u2013 NO, Could the US problem extend to more than 482,000 VW vehicles- YES, but numbers small, low risk, Does this signal the end of diesel \u2013 YES, Do you believe management change at VW is now inevitable \u2013 YES; and Is the share price move excessive, would you buy it here \u2013 YES, with caveats. City firm Bernstein has predicted that the Volkswagen crisis will end the era of diesel cars in Europe. Analyst Max Warburton argues that European regulators had already begun to backtrack after promoting diesel in the 1990s. This week\u2019s revelations will spur them on. Future emissions standards in Europe were already set to tighten the rules on NOx and particulate emissions and even though diesel could theoretically hit these standards, the costs of compliance (due to additional hardware and tech) was going to make diesel uncompetitive in small cars with low price points. That\u2019s good news for petrol and electric vehicles, Warburton adds. The move against VW is going to act as a catalyst to speed up the fall in diesel market share in Europe and halt it in the US. In fact, regulators will now be much more conservative about what they permit and much tougher real world tests may prove either too difficult \u2013 or too expensive \u2013 for diesel to meet. Volkswagen\u2019s denial is short and to the point. Over to Reuters: Volkswagen denied a media report that said Chief Executive Martin Winterkorn was to be replaced amid an emissions scandal that has rocked the company. \u201cNonsense,\u201d a spokesman at the company\u2019s headquarters in Wolfsburg said on Tuesday when asked whether the report byGerman Tagesspiegel was true. The UK government is pushing for a full European inquiry into vehicle emissions, reports the BBC\u2019s business editor Kamal Ahmed. A Volkswagen spokesperson has denied that CEO Martin Winterkorn is about to be replaced by Porsche\u2019s Matthias M\u00fcller. German newspaper Tagesspiegel is reporting that Volkswagen boss Martin Winterkorn will be replaced at Friday\u2019s board meeting. Their sources say he will be succeeded by Porsche CEO Matthias M\u00fcller, with Winterkorn paying the price for VW using illicit software to trick regulators. Here\u2019s their story. Speculation is growing that this scandal could potentially bring down Volkswagen\u2019s CEO, Martin Winterkorn. Volkswagen board is due to meet on Friday will decide whether to extend Winterkorn\u2019s contract until end-2018. Supervisory board member Olaf Lies told German radio station Deutschlandfunk on Tuesday that: \u201cI am sure that there will be personnel consequences in the end, there is no question about it\u201d. Volkswagen\u2019s shares are slumping because there is no precedent for such a scandal, says Peter Garnry, head of equity strategy at Saxo Bank. Emissions rigging is a new area, so investors don\u2019t know how badly VW could be penalised. It\u2019s not like a financial scandal, where there\u2019s a well-trodden path to the regulators\u2019 door. Garnry says: If an automaker violates the Clean Air Act it costs $37,500 per vehicle. Given the number of diesel cars sold [in the US] , this brings the potential fine to $20 billion. However news out this morning states that other governments such as Australia will now look into the matter and see if their emission standards have been violated by Volkswagen. In plain language, this may not be an isolated case so the tail risk is just much bigger. In the worst-case scenario, Volkswagen will be banned from selling diesel vehicles in the US for a certain period such as [French bank] BNP Paribas was banned from conducting certain US dollar transactions for a year, on top of a $9 billion fine due to the French bank\u2019s involvement in helping Sudan, Cuba and Iran perform said transactions. Shares in the major European carmakers have all fallen today. VW is leading the fallers on the German DAX index, followed by Daimler and BMW. In France, Peugeot and Renault are among the biggest fallers on the Paris market, after finance minister Michel Sapin called for a Europe-wide investigation. Volkswagen has revealed for the first time today that 11 million vehicles were fitted with software that tricked regulators into under-recording noxious emissions. Before today, VW has admitted to fitting half a million diesel cars with the code -- something the FT called a \u2018monumental blunder\u2019. But VW has now explained that the code has been installed in other vehicles. And that means 11 million cars with its Type EA 189 engines would show false emission rates when tested. Here\u2019s the key part of the statement: Further internal investigations conducted to date have established that the relevant engine management software is also installed in other Volkswagen Group vehicles with diesel engines. For the majority of these engines the software does not have any effect. Discrepancies relate to vehicles with Type EA 189 engines, involving some eleven million vehicles worldwide. A noticeable deviation between bench test results and actual road use was established solely for this type of engine. Volkswagen is working intensely to eliminate these deviations through technical measures. You can read the full statement here The Economist argues that Volkswagen was already struggling, before being shunted by the revelations surrounding emission tests. Investors have also been spooked by its other problems, which the latest scandal have made worse, it says: VW has been aiming to build more than 10m cars a year, in order to take advantage of the big economies of scale that exist in the industry. But its efforts to grow appear to have faltered. Its market share in America\u2014which at 2.2% last year is less than Subaru\u2019s\u2014is now shrinking, along with its turnover in China. Even the sales it is making are not particularly profitable. Most of its profits are now made by non-VW brands, with margins on its Audis more than six times higher per vehicle than its VW-badged ones. And there may be more trouble left in the wings. Experts say that the recall of 500,000 cars sold in America as a result of cheating the emissions test may grow in size in the weeks and months to come. A string of commentators are suggesting that the emissions scandal could be the auto equivalent of the interest rate-fixing perpetrated by the banking sector. Many of our largest banks were fined billions of dollars each for their role in fixing Libor - the official measure of borrowing costs between banks. The cost of insuring Volkswagen\u2019s corporate debt against default has jumped this today. That indicates concerns that the scandal could cause extremely serious damage: This \u2018annotated\u2019 chart from fastFT shows how the cost of VW credit default swaps has jumped. They would pay out if the carmaker defaulted. The Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) has insisted there was no evidence that manufacturers in the UK attempt to mislead emission testers. The trade association\u2019s chief executive, Mike Hawes, said (via PA). The EU operates a fundamentally different system to the US - with all European tests performed in strict conditions as required by EU law and witnessed by a government-appointed independent approval agency. \u201cThere is no evidence that manufacturers cheat the cycle. Vehicles are removed from the production line randomly and must be standard production models, certified by the relevant authority - the UK body being the Vehicle Certification Agency, which is responsible to the Department for Transport. Hawes also conceded that the current test method is \u201coutdated\u201d - echoing MEP Catherine Bearder\u2019s concerns (see earlier) By my reckoning, around \u20ac28bn has been wiped off the value of Volkswagen this week. Shares were trading at \u20ac162 each on Friday afternoon, valuing the company at \u20ac78.5bn. They have now slumped as low as \u20ac101.5 meaning VW is now worth under just \u20ac50bn. Campaign group Transport &amp; Environment (T&amp;E) has warned that millions of diesel cars could be recalled, if the practice of fiddling emission tests is widespread. T&amp;E\u2019s diesel expert Jos Dings has called for EU regulators to \u201ctake their job seriously\u201d, and examine if cars on the road are pumping out more harmful emissions than is tolerable. I\u2019ve taken the quotes from the Press Association: All the evidence points to exactly the same thing going on in Europe and potentially even worse. \u201cDiesel cars in Europe operate with worse technology on average than the US. \u201cWe are the diesel market but they have dug it up because they take law enforcement seriously.\u201d T&amp;E has claimed that other carmakers also used technology that means diesel cars release fewer smog-causing pollutants during tests than in real-world driving conditions. No other manufacturer has come forward and confirmed this, though. The escalating crisis at Volkswagen is sending shivers through the Frankfurt stock market, where the DAX index has lost 2.7%. The scandal risks denting the reputation of Germany\u2019s manufacturing sector, warns political writer Andrew Lilico. Liberal Democrat MEP Catherine Bearder has warned that European regulators are failing to enforce emission standards. Bearder says: \u201cManufacturers in the US have been caught out, but we know that pollution limits are also being breached in Europe. \u201cWe need to tighten EU emission standards and make sure they are properly enforced. Unless we take action, thousands of lives will continue to be tragically cut short by air pollution.\u201d Volkswagen has also revealed that around 11 million diesel vehicles worldwide were fitted with the software at the centre of the US emissions scandal. It also pledged to work \u201cintensely to eliminate these deviations through technical measures.\u201d Wow. VW shares have crashed by another 20% today, as traders digest this profits warning. Breaking news: Volkswagen has just announced that it will set aside \u20ac6.5bn to cover the costs of the investigation into how its diesel cars cheated emission tests, sending its shares slumping. The move will make a significant hit in its earnings this quarter, as the German carmaker wrestles with the impact of the scandal. In a statement, the German carmaker says that it will not tolerate any legal violation, and is committed to winning back customers\u2019 lost trust And it also warns that that the \u20ac6.5bn could be revised, as the investigation continues. VW shares have crashed by 10% today, on top of yesterday\u2019s 20% slump. It\u2019s another dramatic day for Volkswagen, with its US boss admitting the company \u201ctotally screwed up\u201d (video). And with France\u2019s finance minister calling for a EU-wide inquiry, the crisis could escalate. Over in Greece, state run TV has just announced that prime minister Alexis Tsipras\u2019 new cabinet will be sworn in Wednesday morning, our correspondent Helena Smith reports. Being Greece\u2019s finance minister is one of the roughest jobs in European politics, so we can\u2019t blame Euclid Tsakalotos if he turns it down.... Greek media are reporting that Euclid Tsakalotos, is reluctant to become finance minister again. As we mentioned in yesterday\u2019s blog, Tsakalotos is a member of the Group of 53 -- Syriza MPs who oppose austerity, but remain loyal to Tsipras. As such, Tsakalotos might not fancy implementing the bailout package of tough spending cuts and tax rises. Kathimerini explains: If Tsakalotos was not appointed finance minister he could still lead negotiations with the eurozone, which has agreed an \u20ac86bn ($96 billion) bailout with Greece in exchange for deep economic reforms. Tsipras\u2019s alternative would be Giorgos Houliarakis, who has been finance minister in the caretaker government put in place during Greece\u2019s election campaign. Britain\u2019s slow progress reducing its budget deficit means the UK is vulnerable to economic shocks, warns Ross Campbell, ICAEW Director for Public Sector Policy. Here\u2019s his take on today\u2019s figures: Sorting our public finances depends on robust tax receipts, so it is disappointing to see corporation and income tax revenues decrease. The weakening global economy could also have a significant impact on tax receipts in the coming months, which would only make the situation worse. Back in the eurozone, Italy\u2019s prime minister finance minister has waded into UK politica with an attack on Labour\u2019s leader, Jeremy Corbyn. Matteo Renzi has been dubbed Italy\u2019s Tony Blair. And he probably spoke for the former PM when he told lawmakers that the MP for Islington North wasn\u2019t a winner. Renzi said: \u201cAfter what happened with Corbyn, I think [David] Cameron is the happiest of all about Corbyn\u2019s win.... \u201cIt\u2019s not a question of being Blairite or anti-Blairite, it\u2019s a matter of \u2018Do you want to go to elections like you go to the Olympics, to win or to participate\u2019?\u201d Labour members, though, weren\u2019t convinced by the argument that they needed a more centrist leader - and the voters haven\u2019t had their say yet either. Renzi also told MPs that Greece\u2019s former finance minister, Yanis Varoufakis, had been \u201cgot rid of\u201d. Varoufakis has promptly hit back, declaring that he\u2019s \u201calive and kicking\u201d politically-speaking. Today\u2019s public finance figures also show that Britain is heading towards a deficit of around \u00a370bn this year. Britain had to borrow \u00a312bn to balance the books in August, around \u00a33bn more than expected. But it\u2019s not a reason to panic. This is the largest monthly deficit since August 2012, due to unusually weak income tax receipts. According to the ONS, more people paid income tax bills in July, so last month suffered a shortfall. So far this year, public sector net borrowing is around 10% lower than a year ago, meaning the government is on track to cut the deficit in 2015-16 (but not eliminate, of course). France\u2019s finance minister has called for a \u201cEurope-wide\u201d probe to address the revelations that Volkswagen evaded US pollution tests. AFP has the details: Michel Sapin told French radio that in order to \u201creassure\u201d the public, it seemed \u201cnecessary\u201d to carry out checks on cars manufactured by other European carmakers. \u201cWe are in a European market, with European rules that need to be respected,\u201d Sapin told Europe 1 radio. \u201cEven if it\u2019s just to reassure people, it seems necessary to me that (checks should be carried out) also on French carmakers,\u201d he said, adding he had no \u201cparticular reason\u201d to suspect wrongdoing. The FTSE 100 index of blue-chip shares has now shed 111 points, as the selloff picks up. Pharmaceutical stocks are also falling, as US presidential candidate Hillary Clinton vowed to tackle price-gouging in the sector. She waded in after an entrepreneur hiked the price of a life-saving drug by more than 50 times. Over in Frankfurt, VW\u2019s share price has now lost almost 5%. Other car makers are also leading the DAX fallers, as the revelations that emissions data have been falsified continue to rock the sector. Conner Campbell of SpreadEx explains: News that South Korea, as well as the US, would be investigating the company\u2019s diesel cars took the stock over 4% lower (and counting) immediately after the bell, pushing VW to a further 3 year low (and continuing to have a nasty knock on effect for majority shareholder Porsche and the rest of the auto-sector). A selloff in the mining sector is helping to pull Europe\u2019s stock markets down this morning. The FTSE 100 is leading the selloff, down 1%. In London, commodity trader Glencore has slumped by 10% to 108p. That\u2019s a blow to shareholders who bought shares at 125p in last week\u2019s fundraising. Mining stocks are vulnerable to worries over global economic growth; today the coal prices has continued to slump, with demand looking lighter. Our Q&amp;A explains why the Volkswagen emissions scandal is so serious, and what might happen next: Volkswagen shares are sliding again, down 3.4% in early trading after slumping by a fifth on Monday. The selloff comes after the German automaker\u2019s US chief executive admitted the company has \u201ctotally screwed up\u201d over the emissions scandal that has rocked the automotive industry. Michael Horn admitted at an event in Brooklyn, New York, on Monday night that VW had been \u201cdishonest\u201d with regulators and the public. The world\u2019s second-biggest carmaker could face a fine of up to $18bn (\u00a311.6bn), criminal charges for its executives, and legal action from customers and shareholders due to US claims it used a defeat device to falsify emissions data. Here\u2019s the full story: George Osborne is now fielding questions about his trip to China, on Radio 4\u2019s today programme. He\u2019s defending his decision to build closer ties with Beijing. Tens of thousands of jobs depend on our relations with China, and it\u2019s an important partner in the battle against climate change, the chancellor argues. And what about issues such as human rights? It\u2019s better to engage and talk on issues we disagree on....rather than standing on the sidelines and engaging in megaphone diplomacy. The Bank of England chief economist has warned that interest rates could be cut, so how worried should we be about the UK economy? Osborne: Both the problems in China, and the decisions that the Bank of England and the Federal Reserve are wrestling with, are problems of success. Governor Mark Carney has signalled pretty clear the direction that interest rates are heading (ie, up). George Osborne\u2019s calming words went down well with Chinese traders. The Shanghai index just closed, up almost 1%. UK chancellor George Osborne has called for Britain and China to build a Golden Decade together. And he used a trip to China\u2019s main stock market to do it. Osborne told an audience in Shanghai that: \u201cI very deliberately chose to come here, to the Shanghai Stock Exchange, to the epicentre of the volatility in financial markets this summer, to say this: \u201cWhatever the headlines, regardless of the challenges, we shouldn\u2019t be running away from China.\u201d He added: \u201cLet\u2019s stick together and make Britain China\u2019s best partner in the West. Let\u2019s stick together and create a golden decade for both of our countries.\u201d And here\u2019s a short video of Osborne\u2019s speech: Alexis Tsipras will keep some familiar faces in the top jobs in his cabinet, predicts the Greek newspaper Kathimerini. But he may also create some new roles, to help implement the measures he signed up to this summer. Kathimerini says: It is expected that Euclid Tsakalotos will continue as finance minister and that Giorgos Stathakis will also keep his role at the Economy Ministry. However, Tsipras is said to want to create a position at the level of deputy minister that will carry the responsibility for coordinating the government\u2019s actions in relation to the demands of the third bailout. It is expected that caretaker finance minister Giorgos Houliarakis, who also led Greece\u2019s negotiating team in Brussels over recent months, will take on this role. SYRIZA stalwart Yiannis Dragasakis is expected to continue in his role as deputy prime minister. It was rumored that he was being lined up to become the next parliamentary speaker but it seems that this role is likely to go to Nikos Voutsis. Sources said that Yiannis Panousis is unlikely to be recalled as citizens\u2019 protection minister. Also, the current caretaker minister for immigration policy, Yiannis Mouzalas, may be kept on by the new government. More here: Tsipras returns as PM, cabinet due to follow swiftly Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Having been sworn in as prime minister last night, Alexis Tsipras will be getting to work this morning creating a new cabinet. His eurozone allies are watching closely, to see if the left-winger can now deliver the challenging programme of tax rises and reforms demanded by lenders. As Tsipras sets off on his journey, his former finance minister, Yanis Varoufakis, is predicting he will fall short. Writing in the Guardian, Varoufakis explains why Tsipras will fail: Tsipras must now implement a fiscal consolidation and reform programme that was designed to fail. Illiquid small businesses, with no access to capital markets, have to now pre-pay next year\u2019s tax on their projected 2016 profits. Households will need to fork out outrageous property taxes on non-performing apartments and shops, which they can\u2019t even sell. VAT rate hikes will boost VAT evasion. Week in week out, the troika will be demanding more recessionary, antisocial policies: pension cuts, lower child benefits, more foreclosures. Other problems are surfacing in Europe, though. Among them, the Volkswagen emissions scandal. Overnight, South Korea has announced it will start an investigation into Volkswagen\u2019s (VW) diesel cars after the automaker admitted to rigging emissions tests in the US. How much damage will the unfolding crisis cause to the German car maker, and will the rest of the European car industry be hurt too? And as the UK prime minister is buffeted by a revengeful Lord Ashcroft, his chancellor George Osborne is a mission to build closer ties with China. He\u2019s in Shanghai today, speaking at the country\u2019s stock exchange. Here\u2019s the economic agenda: 9.30am BST: The UK public finances for August, expected to show a deficit of \u00a38.8bn 3pm: Eurozone consumer confidence for September, expected to broadly unchanged European stock markets are expected to inch higher this morning.

VAT rate hikes will boost VAT evasion.</p> <p>Week in week out, the troika will be demanding more recessionary, antisocial policies: pension cuts, lower child benefits, more foreclosures.</p> </blockquote> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/sep/21/alexis-tsipras-greece-greek-leader-troika-yanis-varoufakis\">The lenders are the real winners in Greece \u2013 Alexis Tsipras has been set up to fail | Yanis Varoufakis</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Other problems are surfacing in Europe, though.

    "webTitle": "Corbyn's QE for the people jeopardises the Bank of England's independence", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s proposed \u201cPeople\u2019s QE\u201d has provoked consternation in the academic and central banking world. Even Mark Carney, governor of the Bank of England, has weighed in, despite the perils of central bankers speaking out on matters of political controversy. PQE has divided opinions in the economic commentariat, but it has united all in getting us extremely hot under the collar. PQE involves the government instructing the Bank of England to print money (or rather, the modern equivalent, creating electronic reserves) to purchase bonds issued by a Corbyn-established National Investment Bank. This NIB would then use the money to fund public infrastructure projects, or, in fact, whatever the government fancied. On the face of it, this appears to get rid of the nasty business of having to finance worthy stuff by running deficits, and later, even worse, paying back the debt with taxation revenue. But, in fact, this is not a problem solved at all. It subverts the normal separation of monetary and fiscal policy, currently preserved by the independence of the Bank of England. So what, Corbyn\u2019s supporters have been saying. In fact, John McDonnell wrote shortly before the last election that he wanted \u201cdemocratic control\u201d re-asserted over interest rate setting, the implication being that previously, monetary policy had been subservient to the interests of banks. For this reason, it\u2019s worth spelling out what independence means, and why it serves the \u201cpeople\u201d: lest the impression arise that independence is just something central bankers try to protect to make their jobs seem more important. For starters, under current rules, the government sets the mandate for the Bank of England, and in fact the tools which it can use to do its job. Then the Bank\u2019s monetary policy committee is left to figure out how to pull the levers it has been given to do the job that it has been assigned. So, ultimately, parliament still decides what monetary policy (and, for that matter, financial stability policy) amounts to. The BoE is just left alone to do the job. The reason that\u2019s helpful is that it insulates day to day decisions from politics. One facet of this is that politicians will always find it hard to resist the temptation to stoke up a boom before an election, only later to slam on the brakes once they are safely re-elected. For that reason there is now a fairly solid academic and central bank consensus that by ruling out this kind of political interference, independence helps keep inflation low, and less variable, and also helps smooth the booms and busts in the business cycle. Another clear danger of PQE is, as Carney pointed out, that it removes \u201cfiscal discipline\u201d. Independence of the BoE prevents the government being tempted to finance pet projects with money-printing, thus avoiding the politically tricky decision to borrow. Without this discipline, there is the risk that politicians will succumb to that temptation again and again. Expecting this, the costs of borrowing will rise, constraining the ability of governments to finance public services even more. In the worst-case scenario we would end up with very high or hyper-inflation, and the government forced to balance spending and revenues at all times. Austerity on this scale would presumably do to the UK what the equivalent has done to Greece. One of the elements of the debate I sense is that inflation control is something only the right are supposed to worry about. Explicitly leftist critiques positively relish showing disdain for those that worry about it. Richard Murphy, Corbyn\u2019s economics guru, has written on the web about his dissatisfaction with the primacy of the BoE\u2019s inflation objective, and McDonnell has suggested adding targets on inequality and unemployment. But \u2013 and as I notice Mark Carney emphasised this at Treasury committee on Wednesday last week \u2013 this is completely wrong-headed. High inflation tends to hit the poorest hardest. Because the few assets and cash-flows that they have, tend to be least well-protected from inflation. The rich and middle classes have inflation-linked portfolios and houses. The poor carry disproportionate amounts of cash, are less likely even to have bank accounts, and even when they do are less likely to take advantage of interest-bearing ways to store their money. Moreover, the booms and busts that come with a lack of inflation control also hit the poorest hardest. Because it\u2019s they who bear the brunt of the financial and psychological devastation that goes with the spells of unemployment that accompany the busts. This is one of the reasons why the Balls/Brown decision to give independence to the Bank of England over monetary policy in 1997 was such a masterstroke. Corbyn and McDonnell clearly see this as part of Labour\u2019s desertion of its historical class interests. But, whatever else Balls and Brown did with other Labour policies, the Bank of England Act was actually something that prioritised the interests of the poor.

      "body": "<p>Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s proposed \u201cPeople\u2019s QE\u201d has provoked consternation in the academic and central banking world. Even Mark Carney, governor of the Bank of England, has weighed in, despite the perils of central bankers speaking out on matters of political controversy. PQE has <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/aug/14/is-jeremy-corbyns-policy-of-quantitative-easing-for-people-feasible\">divided opinions in the economic commentariat</a>, but it has united all in getting us extremely hot under the collar.</p> <p>PQE involves the government instructing the Bank of England to print money (or rather, the modern equivalent, creating electronic reserves) to purchase bonds issued by a Corbyn-established National Investment Bank. This NIB would then use the money to fund public infrastructure projects, or, in fact, whatever the government fancied.</p> <p>On the face of it, this appears to get rid of the nasty business of having to finance worthy stuff by running deficits, and later, even worse, paying back the debt with taxation revenue.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/sep/20/jeremy-corbyn-modern-capitalism-needs-opponent\">Modern capitalism needs an opponent. It needs Jeremy Corbyn</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But, in fact, this is not a problem solved at all. It subverts the normal separation of monetary and fiscal policy, currently preserved by the independence of the Bank of England.</p> <p>So what, Corbyn\u2019s supporters have been saying. In fact, John McDonnell wrote shortly before the last election that he wanted \u201cdemocratic control\u201d re-asserted over interest rate setting, the implication being that previously, monetary policy had been subservient to the interests of banks.</p> <p>For this reason, it\u2019s worth spelling out what independence means, and why it serves the \u201cpeople\u201d: lest the impression arise that independence is just something central bankers try to protect to make their jobs seem more important.</p> <p>For starters, under current rules, the government sets the mandate for the Bank of England, and in fact the tools which it can use to do its job. Then the Bank\u2019s monetary policy committee is left to figure out how to pull the levers it has been given to do the job that it has been assigned. </p> <p>So, ultimately, parliament still decides what monetary policy (and, for that matter, financial stability policy) amounts to. The BoE is just left alone to do the job.</p> <p>The reason that\u2019s helpful is that it insulates day to day decisions from politics. One facet of this is that politicians will always find it hard to resist the temptation to stoke up a boom before an election, only later to slam on the brakes once they are safely re-elected.</p> <p>For that reason there is now a fairly solid academic and central bank consensus that by ruling out this kind of political interference, independence helps keep inflation low, and less variable, and also helps smooth the booms and busts in the business cycle.</p> <p>Another clear danger of PQE is, as Carney pointed out, that it removes \u201cfiscal discipline\u201d. Independence of the BoE prevents the government being tempted to finance pet projects with money-printing, thus avoiding the politically tricky decision to borrow.</p> <p>Without this discipline, there is the risk that politicians will succumb to that temptation again and again. Expecting this, the costs of borrowing will rise, constraining the ability of governments to finance public services even more.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/oct/07/quantitative-easing-and-common-sense\">Quantitative easing and common sense | Letters</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In the worst-case scenario we would end up with very high or hyper-inflation, and the government forced to balance spending and revenues at all times.

    "webTitle": "VW scandal: chief executive Martin Winterkorn refuses to quit", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The defiant boss of Volkswagen has refused to resign despite an escalation of the the emissions scandal following the admission by the world\u2019s second largest car marker that 11m vehicles worldwide have been fitted with a defeat device designed to cheat emissions tests. Martin Winterkorn appeared in a video to insist he was \u201cendlessly sorry\u201d for the events at the end of a day in which VW was forced to deny a report in Germany that he will leave as chief executive this Friday, to be replaced by Matthias M\u00fcller, the chairman of its sister company Porsche. He spoke after the German company revealed the potential financial liabilities for the first time. It is putting aside \u20ac6.5bn (\u00a34.7bn) to deal with the potential costs of the crisis, prompting a further 20% fall in its share price. About \u20ac25bn, or a third, has now been wiped off the value of Volkswagen\u2019s shares in the two days of trading since the scandal erupted. Shares in other car manufacturers have also fallen heavily, with Peugeot down 7%, BMW down 5% and Daimler, the owner of Mercedes-Benz, also down 5%. Johnson Matthey, which makes catalytic converters, has fallen nearly 7% in London. The VW financial update was issued on Tuesday after its US chief said on Monday night that the company had \u201ctotally screwed up\u201d over the emissions scandal. Michael Horn admitted at an event in New York that VW had been dishonest with regulators and the public. The number of cars affected dwarfs the 482,000 VWs and Audis recalled by the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). The figure is also higher than the number of cars VW sells in a year worldwide, reflecting the scale of the crisis. While tthe VW boss was defiant, there was a separate intervention by Olaf Lies, a member of VW\u2019s supervisory board and also the economy minister for the state of Lower Saxony, which controls 20% of the company. He said there were likely to be management changes as a result of the scandal. \u201cI am sure that there will be personnel consequences in the end, there is no question about it,\u201d he told Reuters. Angela Merkel has also commented on the growing crisis. \u201cGiven the difficult situation, this is about showing complete transparency, clearing up the entire case,\u201d the German chancellor said in Finland. \u201cThe transport minister is in close contact with the company, Volkswagen, and I hope that the facts will be put on the table as quickly as possible.\u201d VW could face a fine of up to $18bn (\u00a311.6bn), as well as criminal charges for its executives and legal action from customers and shareholders amid claims in the US that it used a device to falsify emissions data. The device recognises when the car is being tested and immediately cuts emissions to a level much lower than normal and which would be unsustainable under normal driving conditions. In a statement, VW said: \u201cDiscrepancies relate to vehicles with type EA 189 engines, involving some 11m vehicles worldwide. A noticeable deviation between bench test results and actual road use was established solely for this type of engine. \u201cVolkswagen is working intensely to eliminate these deviations through technical measures. The company is therefore in contact with the relevant authorities and the German federal motor transport authority.\u201d The carmaker insisted in the statement that new diesel vehicles available in the European Union with EU 6 diesel engines \u201ccomply with legal requirements and environmental standards\u201d. It added: \u201cThe software in question does not affect handling, consumption or emissions. This gives clarity to customers and dealers.\u201d The German company said it was putting aside a provisional \u20ac6.5bn to \u201ccover the necessary service measures and other efforts to win back the trust of our customers\u201d. It added: \u201cVolkswagen does not tolerate any kind of violation of laws whatsoever. It is and remains the top priority of the board of management to win back lost trust and to avert damage to our customers. The group will inform the public on the further progress of the investigations constantly and transparently.\u201d Analysts warned that the crisis could affect other carmakers, with shares down heavily across the sector. Max Warburton at Bernstein warned it could spell the end for diesel cars. The analyst, who on Sunday called VW the \u201cLance Armstrong of automakers\u201d, said: \u201cDiesel has been under growing pressure in recent years, as regulators recognise that it is still not as clean as gasoline, despite meeting official tests. \u201cThe move against VW is going to act as a catalyst to speed up the fall in diesel market share in Europe and halt it in the US. In fact, regulators will now be much more conservative about what they permit and much tougher real world tests may prove either too difficult \u2013 or too expensive \u2013 for diesel to meet.\u201d In further developments, Britain and France called for a Europe-wide investigation into diesel cars to reassure the public. Patrick McLoughlin, the transport secretary, said: \u201cWe are closely monitoring the situation and have been pushing for action at a European level for more accurate tests that reflect driving on the road. It\u2019s vital that the public has confidence in vehicle emissions tests and I am calling for the European commission to investigate this issue as a matter of urgency.\u201d A spokesman for the commission said it was \u201cpremature\u201d to comment on whether there would be a European investigation into VW. South Korea said on Tuesday it would investigate emissions of the VW Jetta and Golf models plus Audi A3 cars produced in 2014 and 2015. If problems are found, South Korea\u2019s environment ministry said its inquiry could be expanded to all German diesel imports, which have surged in popularity in recent years in a market long dominated by local producers such as Hyundai. The US Department of Justice could also conduct a criminal investigation into Volkswagen. The UK campaign group Transport &amp; Environment (T&amp;E) warned that millions of cars could be recalled. T&amp;E\u2019s diesel expert, Jos Dings, said: \u201cOur latest report demonstrated that almost 90% of diesel vehicles didn\u2019t meet emission limits when they drive on the road. We are talking millions of vehicles.\u201d",

Gavin Patterson, the chief executive of BT, called for a \u201ccollaborative effort across industry and government\u201d and a supportive regulatory and policy environment to help provide faster and more comprehensive internet coverage. BT has come under mounting pressure over its dominance of broadband infrastructure in the UK from competitors such as Sky and TalkTalk, which provide services over its network of cables. The communications regulator, Ofcom, is carrying out a review into whether the company\u2019s Openreach division, which operates the cable network, should be spun off. Patterson said BT would provide every household in the UK with connections of at least 5-10Mbps \u2013 fast enough to use popular internet services such as high-definition video \u2013 and offer 10m homes and small businesses \u201cultrafast\u201d speeds of between 300Mbps and 500Mbps by 2020. He also said BT would supply fibre broadband to all new housing developments and begin offering satellite broadband coverage for remote premises later this year. \u201cWe want to forge an ultrafast future for Britain and stand ready to help government deliver the broadband speeds necessary for every property to enjoy modern day internet services, such as high-definition TV streaming and cloud computing,\u201d said Patterson. \u201cTo achieve this, we need a collaborative effort across industry and government.\u201d Ofcom\u2019s job has become more complex as BT and Sky have also begun competing with each other in the pay TV market. BT\u2019s pending \u00a312.5bn acquisition of the UK\u2019s largest mobile operator, EE, which is awaiting regulatory approval, would open up a further battleground between the two companies as Sky also offers mobile contracts via O2. A Sky spokesperson said: \u201cFor years, BT has been under-investing and delivering poor quality service for customers. What the British broadband market urgently needs is radical reform, not calculated manoeuvring and caveats to protect BT\u2019s self-interest. Only a truly independent Openreach will unlock the investment, innovation and competition required to deliver the digital connectivity of the future.\u201d BT is the main beneficiary of the more than \u00a31bn the government is spending to encourage broadband rollout across the UK. However, the company has committed to return some of the funds in areas where fibre broadband take-up exceeds 20% and says it has already paid back \u00a3129m. Data published by Ofcom on Tuesday showed that BT is no longer the most complained about company for pay TV. EE, which was fined \u00a31m in July for mistakes in complaints handling, generates the most landline complaints. Vodafone is the most criticised mobile phone operator. \u2022 This article was amended on 23 September 2015 to remove Virgin from the list of competitors objecting to BT\u2019s position in the broadband market.",

Sainsbury\u2019s was the only one of the so-called big four supermarkets to increase sales during the period, according to the latest market share figures from Kantar. The big four are under pressure following a shift in shopping habits as consumers spend more in small convenience stores, online, and with the discounters Aldi and Lidl. The Co-operative and Iceland, which have struggled in recent months, also showed a lift in sales. In contrast to the struggles of the established grocers, Aldi increased sales by 17.3% and Lidl grew 16%. Almost half of British grocery shoppers now visit Aldi or Lidl every month, according to separate research from Nielsen. Mike Watkins, analyst at Nielsen, said: \u201cThese discounters are attracting new shoppers by opening new stores and using ads that communicate not just value, but quality and freshness too.\u201d Overall sales for the grocery industry rose by 0.9% during the 12 weeks, the sixth consecutive month that sales have grown by less than 1%, with the supermarket price war reducing the value of sales.

This week marks the first anniversary of the discovery of the accounting scandal that rocked Britain\u2019s biggest retailer.

Fraser McKevitt, the head of retail and consumer insight at Kantar, said: \u201cSainsbury\u2019s has grown sales by 0.9% compared with a year ago, attracting 250,000 new shoppers through the door in the last 12 weeks.

The growth of the discount retailers means Aldi increased its market share from 4.8% a year ago to 5.6%, while Lidl expanded from 3.6% to 4.2%.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "A fall in income tax receipts sent Britain\u2019s deficit spiralling to \u00a312.1bn in August, the widest shortfall in government funding since 2012. The Office for National Statistics said a dip in corporation tax receipts was also to blame for the worsening situation, which will put pressure on George Osborne ahead of tough expenditure decisions due in November when Whitehall agrees its five-year spending targets. Dampening the euphoria last month about the first surplus for three years, the deficit represented a big jump on last year\u2019s figure of \u00a310.7bn and much higher than the \u00a39.2bn expected by City analysts. A fall in self-assessment receipts was behind much of the fall in the Treasury\u2019s tax income after a bumper month of self-employed payments in July. The ONS said this changing pattern of payments by the self-employed was unexpected as August usually enjoys a large spillover of tax receipts from the previous month. This year, few extra payments were made in August but the combined receipts for July and August were the highest on record for any July-August period. Government department spending also rose in August compared with a year earlier, bucking the more usual trend of spending restraint. The combination of higher spending and lower tax receipts meant the cumulative deficit of \u00a338.4bn this financial year is only marginally down on the \u00a342.8bn at the same point last year. Vicky Redwood, chief UK economist at Capital Economics, said the government was still on track to reduce its anual borrowing, but at a much slower pacer than previously forecast by the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR). \u201cBorrowing in the first five months of the fiscal year so far is still below where it was at the same point a year ago. But on the face of it, this leaves borrowing for 2015-16 as a whole set to undershoot last year\u2019s borrowing total of \u00a390bn by only \u00a310bn or so, rather than the \u00a320bn drop that the OBR forecast in its July\u2019s budget. \u201cThat said, we would not read too much into one set of figures, given that the trend had previously improving for several months.

Reporting figures for the first half of the year, the Scottish company said bad weather in August had hit drinks sales. As a result, annual pretax profit before exceptional items will be about 5% lower than the \u00a344m forecast by analysts and roughly in line with last year\u2019s \u00a342m figure. The company\u2019s shares fell 5% to 534p, down 10% this year. In the six months to 25 July, pretax profit before one-offs rose 3.3% to \u00a317.8m. Statutory pretax profit fell 11.3% to \u00a316.9m as revenue fell to \u00a3130.3m from \u00a3135.7m. Roger White, AG Barr\u2019s chief executive, said the first half was affected by fierce competition between drinks makers and an internal overhaul of the company\u2019s systems that put investment and promotional activity on hold. AG Barr then faced weather that was much worse than the hot spell the year before. \u201cWe came out of a tricky trading six months and we had a plan to make up the ground we felt we had lost in the first half but the weather in August right across the UK on a comparative basis was not good and the soft drinks market suffered reasonably badly and we didn\u2019t start the half as quickly as we would have liked,\u201d White said. AG Barr\u2019s sales fared worse in the first half than the wider soft drinks market, which fell 0.6%. White said this was because the company was distracted by its reorganisation and because the weather was particularly bad in its heartland of the north of England and Scotland. \u201cAs a consequence of the geographies we operate in, weather patterns and our internal challenges, we have slightly underperformed the market but with most of our key brands we\u2019ve held market share,\u201d he said. As well as Irn Bru, AG Barr produces Strathmore mineral water and Rubicon exotic fruit drinks. Sahil Shan, an analyst at the stockbroker N+1 Singer, said: \u201cMomentum for various reasons has failed to pick up in the third quarter, and management is now guiding to a flat year-on-year profit before tax outcome for the year. Our sell [rating] this year on the grounds of forecast risk and low growth expectations relative to a full rating has served us well, and we maintain our cautious stance.\u201d White said AG Barr\u2019s underlying business remained sound with strong cash flow. The interim dividend increased 8% to 3.36p a share.",

    "webTitle": "Martin Shkreli: entrepreneur defends decision to raise price of life-saving drug 50-fold", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "An entrepreneur who acquired the rights to produce a life-saving drug then increased its price more than 50-fold overnight is defending his decision with assertions that the profits will help create better medicines in future. Medical organizations protested loudly on Sunday after a company owned by controversial former hedge fund manager Martin Shkreli raised the price of the drug Daraprim, which treats a dangerous parasitic infection, from $13.50 per pill to $750 per pill. Shkreli\u2019s startup company, Turing Pharmaceuticals, acquired Daraprim in August. The drug was first developed in the 1940s and is used to treat toxoplasmosis, an infection that is not common but is particularly dangerous and can be fatal when it affects babies born to mothers who have become infected or adults whose immune systems are critically compromised because they are suffering from Aids or some cancers. The Infectious Diseases Society of America and the HIV Medicine Association sent a joint, open letter to Turing Pharmaceuticals earlier in September, complaining that the sudden, steep price increase for Daraprim was \u201cunjustifiable for the medically vulnerable patient population\u201d and also that it was \u201cunsustainable for the health care system\u201d, according to the New York Times. On Monday, Shkreli said: \u201cWe need to turn a profit on the drug.\u201d He defended the decision by telling Bloomberg News that newer versions of the drug needed to be developed and his was the first company \u201cto really focus on this product\u201d for decades and that such research was extremely expensive. He also promised: \u201cIf you cannot afford the drug we will give it away for free.\u201d Shkreli also said the drug was currently underpriced. But the move to inflate the price of Daraprim, which is the brand name for the generic drug pyrimethamine and was originally developed in the 1940s by corporate elements of the pharmaceutical giant now known as GlaxoSmithKline, has set off ripples of concern across the medical community. Doctors may have to provide less effective but cheaper alternatives, said Judith Aberg, at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai hospital in New York. \u201cWhat is it that they are doing differently that has led to this dramatic increase?\u201d she asked. It is not uncommon for companies to use inventive interpretations of government regulations and loopholes in the law to corner the market for certain drugs, especially ones that were developed a long time ago and have only a limited market, then relaunch them at higher prices they believe the market will tolerate.

Almost \u20ac15bn (\u00a310.8bn), or a fifth, was wiped off the company\u2019s market value on Monday as investors took fright at the revelations. At the market opening on Tuesday shares were down a further 3.6%. At up to $37,500 a car (\u00a323,000) in the US, fines could add up to $18bn \u2013 more than a year\u2019s net profit for Volkswagen. Its managers could face criminal charges and a US law firm has already launched a class action lawsuit on behalf of car buyers. Long-term damage to the company\u2019s reputation could be huge. Volkswagen likes to claim it is environmentally conscious and has billed its cars as \u201cclean diesel\u201d. Max Warburton, an analyst at the financial research group Bernstein, said: \u201cThis is really serious.\u201d Is the scandal limited to VW in the US? Possibly not.

      "bodyText": "The emissions-fixing scandal that has engulfed Volkswagen in the US could extend to other companies and countries, one of the officials involved in uncovering the alleged behaviour has told the Guardian. Billions of pounds have been wiped off the value of global carmakers amid growing concerns that emissions tests may have been rigged across the industry. \u201cWe need to ask the question, is this happening in other countries and is this happening at other manufacturers? Some part of our reaction is not even understanding what has happened exactly,\u201d said John German, one of the two co-leads on the US team of the International Council for Clean Transportation (ICCT), the European-based NGO that raised the alarm. Shares in Volkswagen fell by almost a fifth after the world\u2019s second biggest carmaker issued a public apology in response to US allegations that it used a defeat device to falsify emissions data. South Korea said on Tuesday it would investigate emissions of VW Jetta and Gold models and Audi A3 cars produced in 2014 and 2015. If problems are found, South Korea\u2019s environment ministry said its probe could be expanded to all German diesel imports, which have surged in popularity in recent years in a market long dominated by local producers led by Hyundai. US Congress confirmed it is investigating the scandal on Monday. House energy and commerce committee chairman Fred Upton and oversight and investigations subcommittee chairman Tim Murphy announced that the Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee will hold a hearing. The US Justice Department is conducting a criminal investigation of Volkswagen admission, according to Bloomberg, which cited two officials familiar with the inquiry. The company could face a fine of up to $18bn (\u00a311.6bn), criminal charges for its executives, and legal action from customers and shareholders. The US law firm Hagens Berman has already launched a class-action law suit on behalf of customers who bought the affected cars. VW shares fell by 19% in Frankfurt, wiping almost \u20ac15bn (\u00a310.8bn) off its value. Shares in Renault, Volkswagen\u2019s French rival, also dropped by 4%, while Peugeot was down 2.5%, Nissan 2.5% and BMW 1.5% amid concerns they could be caught up in investigations. The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) said on Friday that VW had installed illegal software to cheat emission tests, allowing its diesel cars to produce up to 40 times more pollution than allowed. The US government ordered VW to recall 482,000 VW and Audi cars produced since 2009. In response, Martin Winterkorn, chief executive of VW, said on Sunday he was \u201cdeeply sorry\u201d for breaking the trust of the public and ordered an external investigation. German tipped off regulators at the California Air Resources Board (Carb) and the EPA after conducting tests that showed major discrepancies in the amount of toxic emissions some VW cars were pumping out compared with the legal limits. Max Warburton, an analyst at the financial research group Bernstein, said: \u201cThere is no way to put an optimistic spin on this \u2013 this is really serious.\u201d A British expert in low-emission vehicles claimed the manipulation of air pollution data could be \u201cvery widespread\u201d and that tests in Europe are \u201cmuch more open to this sort of abuse\u201d. Greg Archer, a former government adviser and head of clean vehicles at the respected Transport &amp; Environment thinktank, said: \u201cI am not surprised. There has been a lot of anecdotal evidence about carmakers using these defeat devices. All credit to the EPA for investigating and finding the truth.\u201d Archer, the former managing director of the UK\u2019s Low Carbon Vehicle Partnership and non-executive director for the government\u2019s Renewable Fuels Agency, said the scandal could spread into petrol cars and CO2 levels. \u201cIt is probably not limited to diesel and not limited to emissions,\u201d he added. The devices are thought to work by injecting more urea \u2013 an exhaust fluid \u2013 into the car when it is being tested. This limits nitrogen oxide emissions. The car detects it is being tested because devices such as the anti-collision systems have to be turned off when it is in the laboratory. The extra urea is not injected into the car when it is on the road because it would quickly run out. Archer claims European tests are more open to abuse because they are conducted before the car goes into mass production and by companies that have been paid by the carmakers. These testing companies have been verified by regulators in each country, such as the Vehicle Certification Agency, but in the US the tests are conducted by an independent body. Industry leaders in Britain claimed there was \u201cno evidence\u201d that manufacturers are cheating the system in Europe but admitted it needs to be reformed. Mike Hawes, chief executive of the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders, the industry trade body, said: \u201cThe EU operates a fundamentally different system to the US \u2013 with all European tests performed in strict conditions as required by EU law and witnessed by a government-appointed independent approval agency. There is no evidence that manufacturers cheat the cycle. \u201cThe industry acknowledges, however, that the current test method is outdated and is seeking agreement from the European Commission for a new emissions test that embraces new testing technologies and is more representative of on-road conditions.\u201d The US allegations involve a series of diesel cars produced by VW and the brands it owns, such as Audi. These include the Audi A3, VW Jetta, Beetle, Golf and Passat models. VW has halted sales of these models. Jochen Flasbarth, a senior environment official in the German government, accused Volkswagen of \u201cblatant consumer deception\u201d over the scandal. The country\u2019s economy minister, Sigmar Gabriel, also warned it could damage the reputation of the country\u2019s vital automotive industry. \u201cThat this is a bad case, I think is clear,\u201d Gabriel said. \u201cYou will understand that we are worried that the justifiably excellent reputation of the German car industry and in particular that of Volkswagen suffers.\u201d The German government has launched its own investigation into VW and held talks with executives. The scandal puts the future of Volkswagen chief Winterkorn in serious doubt. Earlier this year he won an internal power struggle with Ferdinand Pi\u00ebch, who stepped down as chairman. The board of the company is due to meet on Friday to discuss extending Winterkorn\u2019s contract. Winterkorn has been at the helm of VW since 2007 and has been directly responsible for research and development since then. Guido Reinking, a German automotive analyst, told German television station n-tv: \u201cIt\u2019s almost impossible to imagine that he didn\u2019t know about this special way of programming the engine.\u201d David Bailey, professor of industrial strategy at Aston University in Birmingham, said: \u201cIf it is the case that they have been trying to hoodwink regulators, it\u2019s a really dumb thing to do. Regulators will look at this more closely now. There has been growing concern about diesel cars and nitrous oxide emissions. The industry has been trying to make the case that the latest regulations largely deal with that issue but regulators will now look more closely at whether they have.\u201d In the wake of the scandal two senior VW executives cancelled a planned appearance at a media event in New York with rock star Lenny Kravitz scheduled for Monday evening. Herbert Diess, chairman of the VW brand\u2019s management board, and Heinz-Jakob Neusser, VW\u2019s board member in charge of technical development, had planned to attend the event to introduce the latest version of the Passat mid-size sedan. The chief executive of VW\u2019s US arm, Michael Horn, was still due to attend the event. He is expected to provide a statement about the situation.",

If problems are found, South Korea\u2019s environment ministry said its probe could be expanded to all German diesel imports, which have surged in popularity in recent years in a market long dominated by local producers led by Hyundai. </p> <p>US Congress confirmed it is investigating the scandal on Monday. House energy and commerce committee chairman Fred Upton and oversight and investigations subcommittee chairman Tim Murphy <a href=\"http://energycommerce.house.gov/press-release/upton-murphy-announce-hearing-volkswagen-emissions-issues#sthash.6vb9aLGe.dpuf\">announced</a> that the Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee will hold a hearing.</p> <p>The US Justice Department is conducting a criminal investigation of Volkswagen admission, according to <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-09-21/volkswagen-said-to-be-target-of-u-s-criminal-probe-on-emissions\">Bloomberg</a>, which cited two officials familiar with the inquiry.</p> <p>The company could face a fine of up to $18bn (\u00a311.6bn), criminal charges for its executives, and legal action from customers and shareholders.

Shares in Renault, Volkswagen\u2019s French rival, also dropped by 4%, while Peugeot was down 2.5%, Nissan 2.5% and BMW 1.5% amid concerns they could be caught up in investigations.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/sep/24/vw-scandal-must-change-how-we-think-about-transport-and-the-environment\">VW scandal must change how we think about transport and the environment | Letters</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) said on Friday that VW had <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/sep/18/epa-california-investigate-volkswagen-clean-air-violations\">installed illegal software to cheat emission tests</a>, allowing its diesel cars to produce up to 40 times more pollution than allowed. The US government ordered VW to recall 482,000 VW and Audi cars produced since 2009.<br></p> <p>In response, Martin Winterkorn, chief executive of VW, said on Sunday he was \u201cdeeply sorry\u201d for breaking the trust of the public and ordered an external investigation.</p> <p>German tipped off regulators at the California Air Resources Board (Carb) and the EPA after conducting tests that showed major discrepancies in the amount of toxic emissions some VW cars were pumping out compared with the legal limits.</p> <p>Max Warburton, an analyst at the financial research group Bernstein, said: \u201cThere is no way to put an optimistic spin on this \u2013 this is really serious.\u201d</p> <p>A British expert in low-emission vehicles claimed the manipulation of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/carbon-emissions\">air pollution data</a> could be \u201cvery widespread\u201d and that tests in Europe are \u201cmuch more open to this sort of abuse\u201d.</p> <p>Greg Archer, a former government adviser and head of clean vehicles at the respected Transport &amp; Environment thinktank, said: \u201cI am not surprised. There has been a lot of anecdotal evidence about carmakers using these defeat devices. All credit to the EPA for investigating and finding the truth.\u201d</p> <p>Archer, the former managing director of the UK\u2019s Low Carbon Vehicle Partnership and non-executive director for the government\u2019s Renewable Fuels Agency, said the scandal could spread into petrol cars and CO2 levels. \u201cIt is probably not limited to diesel and not limited to emissions,\u201d he added.</p> <p>The devices are thought to work by injecting more urea \u2013 an exhaust fluid \u2013 into the car when it is being tested. This limits nitrogen oxide emissions. The car detects it is being tested because devices such as the anti-collision systems have to be turned off when it is in the laboratory. The extra urea is not injected into the car when it is on the road because it would quickly run out.</p> <p>Archer claims European tests are more open to abuse because they are conducted before the car goes into mass production and by companies that have been paid by the carmakers. These testing companies have been verified by regulators in each country, such as the Vehicle Certification Agency, but in the US the tests are conducted by an independent body.<br></p> <p>Industry leaders in Britain claimed there was \u201cno evidence\u201d that manufacturers are cheating the system in Europe but admitted it needs to be reformed. </p> <p>Mike Hawes, chief executive of the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders, the industry trade body, said: \u201cThe EU operates a fundamentally different system to the US \u2013 with all European tests performed in strict conditions as required by EU law and witnessed by a government-appointed independent approval agency. There is no evidence that manufacturers cheat the cycle.</p> <p>\u201cThe industry acknowledges, however, that the current test method is outdated and is seeking agreement from the European Commission for a new emissions test that embraces new testing technologies and is more representative of on-road conditions.\u201d</p> <p>The US allegations involve a series of diesel cars produced by VW and the brands it owns, such as Audi. These include the Audi A3, VW Jetta, Beetle, Golf and Passat models. VW has halted sales of these models.</p> <p>Jochen Flasbarth, a senior environment official in the German government, accused Volkswagen of \u201cblatant consumer deception\u201d over the scandal. The country\u2019s economy minister, Sigmar Gabriel, also warned it could damage the reputation of the country\u2019s vital automotive industry.</p> <p>\u201cThat this is a bad case, I think is clear,\u201d Gabriel said. \u201cYou will understand that we are worried that the justifiably excellent reputation of the German car industry and in particular that of Volkswagen suffers.\u201d The German government has launched its own investigation into VW and held talks with executives.</p> <p>The scandal puts the future of Volkswagen chief Winterkorn in serious doubt. Earlier this year he won an internal power struggle with Ferdinand Pi\u00ebch, who stepped down as chairman.
