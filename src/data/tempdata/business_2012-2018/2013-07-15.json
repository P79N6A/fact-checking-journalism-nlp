The Institute of Economic Affairs launches its Brexit Prize on Tuesday saying that \"we need to give serious consideration to how the UK could have a free and prosperous economy outside the EU given that exit is a serious possibility after the next election\". The free-market thinktank is inviting entries from individuals and groups and will award the first prize of \u20ac100,000 to the best blueprint for the UK after leaving the EU. Entrants are asked to imagine a referendum has resulted in an \"out\" vote and the government has triggered article 50 of the Lisbon treaty. Candidates will need to cover the process of withdrawal and the repositioning of the UK in global trading and governance systems. The judging panel will be chaired by Tory peer and former chancellor Lord Lawson, who recently claimed the British economy would be better off outside the EU. \"Now that we have been promised an in-out referendum on Britain and the EU in 2017, it is essential that this momentous decision is preceded by a well-informed debate,\" said Lawson. \"To date much of this debate has generated more heat than light. It is crucial that we should look into the policy framework that would be needed if Britain decides to leave the EU. The creation of the eurozone, of which the UK is (quite rightly) not a member, has fundamentally changed both the nature of the European Union and the case for the UK remaining a member of it.\" The IEA, responsible for many of the policies implemented by Margaret Thatcher in the 1980s, said there was an urgent need to explore the implications for Britain of a so-called Brexit. The thinktank's Philip Booth said the choice of euros for the prize was symbolic. \"The judges believe that exit from the EU should lead to an outward-looking, freely trading Britain and not an inward-looking Britain trying to shore up domestic markets and vested interests. The prize could just as well be dollars (or sterling) but we would hope that entrants will appreciate that we want a Brexit plan that will promote trade and prosperity for the UK, which will, itself, have benefits for the remaining EU.\" It is inviting 2,000-word submissions from individuals, groups of individuals, academia and corporate bodies such as consultancy firms and investment banks by a 16 September. A shortlist will then be given more time to submit between 10,000 and 20,000 words to the judging panel, which includes historian David Starkey and Labour MP Gisela Stuart. The Brexit prize follows a similar competition run by the thinktank Policy Exchange to find the least disruptive way to organise a breakup of the euro. The \u00a3250,000 Wolfson Prize, the second most lucrative prize for economics after the annual Nobel prize, went to economist Roger Bootle, from Capital Economics, who is now on the IEA's judging panel.",

Who should shareholders support at the annual meeting on 25 July? On current information they should back M&amp;G, for a couple of reasons. First, the pay awarded in the past couple of years to Todd Kozel, Gulf Keystone's chief executive, is absurd. It is out of all proportion to the company's achievements. Yes, it is true that the group has much to shout about. It has discovered 42% of the oil estimated to be in place in the Kurdistan region of Iraq \u2013 that's a huge find. But discovery is only half the battle. Production is only just coming on stream later this year and last year's result was a pre-tax loss of $80m (\u00a353m). Yet Keystone is paying out to Kozel as if the final triumph has already been secured. He received $22m last year and was awarded $13.6m, plus a deferred $9m, this year. Second, Gulf Keystone is moving up from the Aim market to the main London market. A belt-and-braces job on governance is entirely in order and, indeed, would be good for the share price. The company's version has seen Simon Murray, lately of Glencore, appointed as independent chairman. Murray has his fans but being a former non-executive director of Sino-Forest, the failed Chinese forestry venture, is a mighty blemish on his CV. We await Gulf Keystone's other proposals for new directors. But M&amp;G is a long-standing investor in this business and has watched the share price fall from 425p to 157p.

UKFI said during the review it would focus on protecting value for the taxpayer as a shareholder and \"to create an orderly path to privatisation\".",

      "bodyText": "The Serious Fraud Office has charged two brokers with conspiracy to defraud as part of its ongoing investigation into the rigging of Libor. The two men, who formerly worked for inter-dealer broker RP Martin, were arrested in December along with Tom Hayes, who last month was charged with eight counts of conspiracy to defraud. Terry Farr, 41, and James Gilmour, 48, attended Bishopsgate police station in London on Monday and were charged by City of London police with conspiracy to defraud. They will appear before Westminster Magistrates' Court at a later date. Gilmour was charged with one count of conspiracy to defraud; Farr with two, the SFO said. Katie Wheatley, partner and joint head of the criminal law team at Bindmans, said: \"Mr Farr will place his trust in the court to determine a just outcome but it is regrettable that of all the very many organisations and individuals who may have contributed to the failings of Libor-setting the SFO has chosen to charge Mr Farr, an unqualified inter-bank broker who had no responsibility whatsoever for setting Libor rates \u2013 a minnow in a very large pond \u2013 for doing what he believed to be his job.\" A lawyer for Gilmour said it was not appropriate to comment at this time.

When the UBS fine was announced in December, Hayes, a British citizen, was immediately charged by the US authorities with conspiracy, wire fraud and an anti-trust violation. The SFO did not provide details of the time period when the alleged conspiracy by the RP Martin brokers would have taken place. The charges against Hayes, who worked for UBS and Citigroup in Japan, cover the years between August 2006 and September 2010 and include allegations about a web of financial firms with which he is alleged to have conspired to fix Libor, including RBS, JP Morgan Chase, Deutsche Bank, Rabobank, RP Martin, HSBC and Tullett Prebon. After the Libor scandal the UK government commissioned an inquiry into cleaning up the setting of the key benchmark rate, which is used to fix $300tn of contracts worldwide, and last week handed control of the setting process to a London-based body controlled by the New York Stock Exchange.

    "webTitle": "More than 2,400 UK bankers paid \u20ac1m-plus, EU regulator says", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The row over bankers' pay has been reignited by data showing that more than 2,400 bankers in the City were paid in excess of \u20ac1m (\u00a3870,000) in 2011 \u2013 more than three times as many as in the rest of the EU put together. A total of 3,175 bankers across the EU met the regulatory description of \"high earners\" \u2013 taking home more than \u20ac1m in salary and bonuses \u2013 according to the European Banking Authority, the pan-EU regulator, with 2,436 of them in the UK and 739 spread across the rest of the EU. The next largest total was in Germany, where 170 received \u20ac1m or more for 2011; in France it was 162. In eight countries in the EU, no bankers received more than \u20ac1m, although in countries worst hit by the eurozone crisis \u2013 such as Cyprus, Greece, Portugal and Ireland \u2013 some bankers earned more than \u20ac1m. Pat McFadden, a Labour MP who sits on the Treasury select committee, said: \"These figures illustrate the on-going problem with huge salaries in banking at a time of austerity for most people. The problem with pay in banking is not just the high levels but that bonuses are paid out without risks being understood and on the basis of results that don't look so good in the future.\" The information about high earners is available to regulators following the introduction of remuneration codes in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis. The now defunct City regulator, the Financial Services Authority, first began to shed light on pay scales in the City in 2010 when it published data showing that 2,800 bankers received more than \u00a31m in 2009, the first year after the banking crisis. The EBA will now publish the data on high earners annually as regulators attempt to analyse the way pay deals are structured, particularly as a new bonus cap is introduced across the EU. The number of high earners was greater in 2010, when 3,435 across the EU received at least \u20ac1m \u2013 2,525 of them in the UK. The figures showed a fall in pay between 2010 and 2011 \u2013 the average pay of those earning more than \u20ac1m in the UK in 2011 was calculated by the EBA as \u20ac1.4m, down from \u20ac2.3m a year earlier. The highest average was in Spain, where the banking sector was bailed out by the EU, the 125 paid more than \u20ac1m receiving an average of \u20ac2.4m in 2011. Individual bankers earning more than \u20ac500,000 face having their bonuses capped at 100% of their salary from 2014, and the new data shows that the City as a whole breaches this cap, paying out \u20ac2.7bn in bonuses 2011, which was more than three times as much as was paid in fixed salaries, although this was down on the \u20ac5bn \u2013 six times salaries \u2013 paid out in 2010. There are expectations that banks may respond to the bonus cap by raising fixed salaries. Nicholas Stretch, of law firm CMS Cameron McKenna, said: \"Because London has a very large number of people with variable high pay, the forthcoming bonus capping rules \u2013 and extending the number of people caught by the rules \u2013 will have a particular impact on our financial services industry and lead to extensive changes in how remuneration is provided.\" The UK total of euro millionaire bankers is inflated because it includes those employed by the UK arms of EU banks which have a presence in the City because of its role as a major international financial centre. Almost three-quarters of the 2,436 who received more than \u20ac1m in 2011 were classified as working in investment banking \u2013 some 1,809 \u2013 while 85 work in retail banking, 182 in asset management and 360 in other business areas. Unite national officer Dominic Hook said: \"There is a huge gap between the highest and lowest paid workers in Britain's financial services industry. \"It is high time that banks addressed this gap. Spreading reward more evenly across the banks would embed a culture of fairness and responsibility.\"",

Here's a very brisk closing summary: \u2022 Greek unions are preparing for another general strike, starting midnight tonight. The protests, which will hit transport services, schools, hospitals and government offices, are designed to put pressure on MPs to reject the latest planned job cuts to the public sector. See 4.59pm for details. \u2022 Police officers have already held fresh protest today. Athens was brought to a halt by demonstrators in cars and on motorbikes, in the latest sign that municipal workers have not accepted the deep redundancies demanded by the Troika. See 11.57am for photos and 1.12pm for a report from the scene. \u2022 Spain continues to be gripped by the illegal payments scandal that has struck its ruling party. Prime minister Mariano Rajoy hopes to ride out the storm, refusing to resign today and insisting that stability is important. (see 8,.44am for the latest allegations and 3.19pm for highlights of Rajoy's press conference today) \u2022 The man at the heart of the issue, former party treasurer Luis Barcenas, appeared in court to answer questions over the affair. Details here \u2022 The day began with confirmation that China's economy is slowing. But at 7.5%, on an annual basis, its GDP growth was better than feared. See 8.25am for details \u2022 While the latest US economic data was murky. Manufacturing beat forecasts, but retail sales were weak. See 2pm \u2022 And European stock markets rose, on a mixture of Chinese relief and speculation that the US stimulus programme has longer to run. See 5.25pm for closing prices and the main movers on the FTSE 100. \u2022 And finally, Fitch downgraded the eurozone's temporary bailout fund, the EFSF. The fallout from France's downgrade continues... (see 5.53pm) I\"ll be back tomorrow. Should be more lively. Until then, thanks for reading and for the comments (as ever!). Goodnight! GW Worth noting the 'Key Assumpions' that Fitch uses to assess the EFSF's credit rating (and by extension the eurozone as a whole): Fitch assumes there will be progress in deepening fiscal and financial integration at the eurozone level in line with commitments by euro area policy makers. Fitch also assumes that the risk of fragmentation of the eurozone remains low. On the one hand, that's encouraging. On t'other, it means further downgrades if progress stumbles or the crisis flares up again. Some late breaking news - Fitch, the credit rating agency, has downgraded the European Financial Stability Facility, the bailout fund which helped to finance several eurozone bailouts. The move follows Friday night's downgrade of France, one of the main backers of the EFSF. Here's the statement: Fitch Downgrades European Financial Stability Facility to 'AA+' A gentle day for Europe's stock markets. Relief that China's growth slowdown wasn't worse helped to push shares higher, while the Spanish stock market slipped as the slush fund scandal rumbled on. Today's weaker-than-expected US retail sales figures (2pm) helped push shares higher, as it boosted hopes that America's stimulus packages will run for longer.... Here's the closing prices: \u2022 FTSE 100: up 41 points at 6586, +0.6% \u2022 German DAX: up 22 points at 8234, + 0.27% \u2022 French CAC: up 23 points at 3878, +0.6% \u2022 Spanish IBEX: up 10 points at 7855, + 0.13% \u2022 Italian FTSE MIB: up 166 points at 15597, + 1% Greece's unions are getting ready for their third general strike of 2013, starting at midnight tonight. GSEE, the biggest private-sector union, hopes that the walkout will persuade the Greek government to change course, as it brings leglslation to cut the public service workforce. In a statement, GSEE said: The workers continue the struggle to put a final end to these policies that kill labor and drive the economy to ever deeper recession. We demand a change to the politics of firings, privatization and divestiture of the public sector. (via Bloomberg) As usual, government services, transport links, schools and health services could all be disrupted by the walkout. Open Europe has been tracking the latest developments in Spain here: Slush fund scandal reignites in Spain, but risk of early elections remains small It flags up that Mariano Rajoy's comments on the illegal payments scandal this afternoon (see 3.19pm onwards) may have been pre-prepared: Another interesting fact from the Rajoy-Tusk presser. When a foreign leader comes to Spain on an official visit, the protocol establishes that, at the joint press conference, Spanish journalists and their counterparts from the visitor's country are only allowed two questions each. Today, it had been agreed that the two questions from the Spanish side would come from El Mundo and the news agency EFE. However, Rajoy unexpectedly gave the floor to a journalist from ABC. Asked by his colleagues at the end of the presser, the ABC journalist explained that he had received a phone call from his editor dictating him the exact wording of the question he had to put to Rajoy - who then replied by reading a short written statement he had prepared. The International Monetary Fund has added to the pressure on Spain today, warning that its banks are still at risk - despite recent progress. In its latest assessment of the Spanish financial sector, released this afternoon, the IMF welcomed the creation of Spain's Bad Bank, called Sareb, which hasmopped up toxic loans from the commercial banking sector. But given the ongoing economic downturn,the country's banks are not out of the woods. The IMF fears they will suffer new losses as the recession continues, forcing them to limit their lending. It wants them to boost their capital ratios by cutting cash dividends or issuing new shares instead. In its report, the IMF warned that Spain's banking sector was in a poor position, saying: Risks to the financial sector arising from the difficult economic environment still loom large, requiring continued action to safeguard the program's gains and better support economic recovery. Adding: Financial sector dynamics still contribute to recessionary pressures, with credit contraction accelerating, lending standards tightening, and lending rates to firms rising. Not a good time for the prime minister to be fighting calls for his resignation.... Luis Barcenas, the former treasurer of Mariano Rajoy's Popular Party, spent several hours in a closed-doors court hearing today. Barcenas faces several charges including bribery, money laundering and tax fraud, relating to allegations that PP ran a secret fund where businesspeople funneled payments to the party. Reuters reports that Barcenas, who has been held in prison since June, disclosed new documents to judge overseeing the case: A High Court judge questioned Barcenas behind closed doors for more than three hours on Monday after he was transported from jail in a white and black van. A lawyer involved with the case told Reuters that Barcenas, a once-trusted aide, turned over documents showing how he ran a secret slush fund at the party for many years, and provided details of years of cash payouts to party leaders. Over his more than 20 years handling PP finances, Barcenas accumulated as much as 48 million euros in Swiss bank accounts that prosecutors say he has failed to adequately explain. Rajoy is not charged with any crime and has repeatedly denied that he or other party leaders received illegal payments. While Rajoy is refusing to resign over the affair (see 3.19pm), public anger over the scandal is rising, at a time when Spanish citizens have suffered from a long recession and record unemployment: Spanish prime minister Mariano Rajoy has defended himself over the slush fund scandal, and refused to resign. Speaking as the former treasurer of his Popular Party appeared in court over the affair, Rajoy said he would not bow to calls to step down. Rajoy insisted that he would see out his term of office, and would not allow the case to derail his political reform programme. At a press conference with the Polish prime minister, Donald Tusk, Rajoy said: I will defend political stability and I will fulfill the mandate given to me by Spanish voters. As explained at 8.44am, the El Mundo newspaper published text messages which they claim show Rajoy offering support to Luis Barcenas, the ex-treasurer of the PP party, who is accused of collecting secret payments from Spanish businessmen and passing the onto senior party members. Rajoy declined to comment on these latest allegations, as journalist Jos\u00e9 Miguel Sardo flags up: City analysts aren't convinced that Rajoy can ride out the storm..... The spate of demonstrations in Greece in recent days, and the protests planned for this week, highlights the anger and shock felt by public sector workers who have discovered their jobs are being cut to meet the targets set by the Troika. Teacher Dude, a citizen journalist who covers the Greek crisis, reports: Confirmation that tomorrow's general strike in Greece will hit some flights into the country, with civil aviation employees planning to stop work between noon and 4pm (10am-2pm). A classic mixed bag of economic news from the US. The Good: The 'Empire State' survey of the manufacturing sector in the New York area, which showed a decent, unexpected, rise in output . Business conditions rose to 9.46, up from 7.84 in June, bneating foreacsts of a reading of 5. The Bad: US retail sales only rose by 0.4% last month, dashing hopes of a 0.8% rise. Strip out spending on new cars, and gasoline, and sales were down by 0.1%. And the bad news is trumping the good news, it seems, with the dollar weakening -- on the grounds that this makes an early 'tapering' of America's stimulus measures a little less likely. Traffic was brought to a standstill in Athens by the striking municipal police offices who held a demonstration against the plan to lay off thousands of public workers (see 11.57am for details &amp; early photos). Associated Press reports: Sirens blaring, striking municipal police officers brought traffic to a standstill across central Athens Monday. As part of a protest against government cuts, the officers parked their motorcycles and patrol cars outside the offices of the governing center-right New Democracy party and its Socialist coalition partner. The officers hope to persuade MPs not to support the firing of 15,000 public sector workers by the end of 2014, as demanded by Greece's lenders. AP continues: The rally launched a week of planned demonstrations against the latest round of austerity measures that will impose staff cuts on teachers and local government. Municipal authorities across Greece including the Athens municipal police, who are generally tasked with checking parking violations and checking street vendors have suspended services for three days, while unions have called a general strike for Tuesday. ... Public sector workers, while slapped with repeated salary and benefit cuts, have been spared firings until this year. The measures are to be voted by parliament this week the first major political test for Conservative Prime Minister Antonis Samaras since a left-wing party abandoned his coalition government last month, leaving it with a reduced majority. As explained earlier (11.26am), the municipal workers' strike will last until the end of Wednesday. Then on Thursday, German finance minister Wolfgang Schaeuble is visiting Athens..... Uk business confidence has hit a six-year high, a new global business outlook survey from Markit has found. However, eurozone firms are much less upbeat, as Markit's chief economist, Chris Williamson, explains: The eurozone remains a weak spot in the global picture, though far less so than late last year. However, while there are signs of rising optimism in the periphery, notably Spain and Ireland, the mood in France and Germany remains subdued compared with earlier in the recovery, which will restrain the overall pace of economic recovery for the region. The survey also found that global business confidence had deteriorated in recent months, with US and Chinese firms less optimistic \u2013 even before today's GDP data confirmed China's growth was slowing (see opening post). Here's the full story: UK business optimism at six-year high Heads-up: Former Goldman Sachs banker Fabrice Tourre will go on trial today on civil fraud charges relating to sales of bundled mortgage securities in the run-up to the financial crisis. 'Fabulous Fab' is the only Goldmanite to face charges over the affair, which attracted a $550m fine in 2010. As our Wall Street correspondent Dominic Rushe explains, its a chance for the Securities and Exchange Commission to win a high-profile cases related to the credit crunch: Tourre, a mid-level employee, was the only Goldman executive to be charged individually and chose to fight the case. Tourre is to argue he was just a cog in the machine, and that those who lost money were sophisticated investors who made their own bad decisions. The SEC claims that Tourre misled clients who were sold a 'toxic' derivatives product, by not revealing that hedge fund billionaire John Paulson had helped choose which mortgages were included, and was planning to bet on the assets falling in value, Tourre denies the charges. More details here. Following on from that last post, Greek municipal police officers in cars and on motorbikes have held a demonstration against public sector layoffs this morning. Here's the latest photos from Athens: It's shaping up to be another week of anti-austerity protests in Greece. A general strike has been called for Tuesday by the main public and private sector unions, who will hold a protest march in Athens. Local airports and long-distance train services are likely to be disrupted (check out Living in Greece for full details). Municipal workers have already begun a new three-day walkout this morning, against propose layoffs. Union leaders representing the municipal workers are due to meet with deputy prime minister Evangelos Venizelos, finance minister Yannis Stournaras, interior minister Yiannis Michelakis and administrative reform Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis this afternoon. The Athens parliament is due to vote on the latest measures agreed with its Troika of lenders later this week. MPs are also expected to vote tonight on whether former finance minister Giorgos Papaconstantinou should be prosecuted over the Lagarde list of tax evaders (he denies removing the names of several relatives from the list). Being stripped of its AAA rating hasn't done France any immediate harm, with its government bond prices little changed this morning. Fitch became the third and final major credit rating agency to downgrade France, on Friday night, with a one-notch downgrade to AA+. The French debt burden is no longer consistent with a top-rated country, Fitch warned, with general government gross debt expected to peak at 96% of GDP next year, and still be 92% in 2017. Bond traders aren't spooked, though, with the yield (interest rate) on French 10-year bonds up just 0.02% at 2.2% this morning. Investors won't have been surprised to hear that France has a debt problem \u2013 Fitch is rather late to this party. And with so many AAA ratings having been trampled underfoot since the crisis began, a downgrade carries little oomph. As Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou, head of global asset allocation at JPMorgan, put it, double-A is the new triple-A: Conservative bond investors, such as reserve managers, used to have triple-A only mandates but they have adapted to the reality that there aren\u2019t many triple-As anymore. (quote via Reuters) In the UK, three pro-European politicians from across the political spectrum are warning that it would be a \"historical error\" for Britain to quit the European Union. The Conservative cabinet minister Ken Clarke, Liberal Democrat Danny Alexander (number 2 at the Treasury) and Labour's Lord Mandelson are all backing a cross-party group called British Influence. It's new manifesto, called 'Better off in a Better Europe', is being launched today. It argues that the UK should help reform the EU from the inside, making it \"leaner and meaner\", rather than quitting. The move comes days after MPs voted in favour of an in-out EU referendum \u2013 Clarke was one of a small handful of Tories who didn't back the plan. Here's the full story: Ken Clarke, Danny Alexander and Lord Mandelson warn against EU exit European stock markets are holding onto their early gains (see 8.25am), and Mike McCudden, head of derivatives at stockbroker Interactive Investor, confirms that the Chinese economic data has provided cheer: Solid Chinese GDP has provided the comfort many investors were looking for and equities have been given a confidence boost in early trade. Over in Greece, left-wing politician Alexis Tsipras is celebrating after being re-elected leader of Syriza last night. Syriza has officially changed to become a single party rather than a coalition of leftists factions, in an attempt to pick up more support after surging to second place in last year's elections. Tsipras, who picked up 74% of the vote, declared: Starting tomorrow, with our new party, all together, stronger and more united than ever, we will embark on our great and victorious path. Tsipras also declared that Syriza would support striking Greek municipal workers \"to the end\", as they fight thousands of public sector job cuts. During a five-day congress, Syriza also agreed to keep pushing for Greece's bailout programme to be renegotiated: Kathimerini reports: The party adopted as its official position the cancelling of Greece's EU-IMF memorandum and the renegotiation of its loan agreement. It also intends to carry out an audit of Greece's public debt with the aim of cancelling any part that is considered \"odious\", or illegitimate. Over on Alphaville, Kate Mackenzie has crunched through the details of China's economic data (showing an annual growth rate of 7.5%), and flagged up some key details: \u2022 The seasonally-adjusted rate is 1.7 per cent. If annualised \u2014 ie the way that most countries present their quarterly GDP data \u2014 is it just under 7 per cent. On the same basis, Q1 was 6.6 per cent, and Q4 2012 was 7.8 per cent (see table below for more). \u2022 The headline rate of 7.5 per cent for Q2 was in line with expectations \u2014 but those expectations had fallen fairly rapidly from 7.8% about a month ago (at least on the Bloomberg survey). There were also an intruiging rise in 'capital formation', which helpfully offset a drop in export growth. More here: China GDP Portugal's three political parties have set themselves a week to agree a \"national salvation pact\" to keep its bailout programme on track. Late last night, the opposition socialist party said it has begun talks with the two coalition parties who form the Portuguese government. In a statement, it explained: The talk process began today with representatives from the Social Democratic Party, the Democratic and Social Center Party and the Socialist Party discussing methodology of the works and fixing a deadline of a week to...search for a national salvation commitment. (via the WSJ) The parties are aiming to get a deal by July 21 (next Sunday). The talks come after the country's president shook Portugal by calling for politicians of all sides to work together, ahead of elections next year. Over in Madrid, Mariano Rajoy is under renewed pressure after the country's opposition leader called for his resignation over the illicit payments scandal. There were also demonstrations in Barcelona yesterday, after a Spanish newspaper claimed that the prime minister had texted messages of support to the former party treasurer at the heart of the 'slush fund' scandal that has gripped Rajoy's Popular Party (PP), and the country, for months. El Mundo said Mr Rajoy had sent supportive words to Luis Barcenas, PP's former treasurer, who is accused of taking secret donations from businesspeople and passing them on to senior party members. One alleged text message read: Luis, I understand. Stay strong. I'll call you tomorrow. A hug. Barcenas denies charges of corruption and tax fraud, and Rajoy also denies any wrongdoing. But the scandal, and the drip-drip-drip of allegations continues to dog the PM. The leader of Spain's main opposition Socialist Party, Alfredo Perez Rubalcaba, said last night that he was cutting all contact with Rajoy and PP, and said the PM should resign. Rubalcaba declared: Mr Rajoy's conduct in this situation can be summarised quite simply: silence, lies, and after what we have learned today, collusion, extremely serious collusion Barcenas is due back in court later today. There's relief in the City this morning that the Chinese GDP data didn't show a sharper slowdown. The main European stock markets are all showing gains, led by mining stocks, after Shanghai's stock market rose by almost 1%. Here's the early prices: \u2022 FTSE 100: up 47 points at 6592, + 0.75% \u2022 German DAX: up 43 points at 8255, + 0.5% \u2022 French CAC: up 21 points at 3877, + 0.57% \u2022 Spanish IBEX: up 43 points at 7888, + 0.5% \u2022 Italian FTSE MIB: up 102 poiints at 15533, + 0.6% Traders are cheered that China isn't slowing down more rapidly, especially after finance minister Lou Jiwei had appeared to hint that the data would be worse: Mike van Dulken, head of research at Accendo Markets, explains: While there may be concerns thar China's official target will be missed and a potential lower rate of growth, there is no real surprise as we get used to the emerging giant\u2019s growth having to slow up after years of strong expansion... Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the latest events across the eurozone, the financial markets and the global economy. The most important economic news this morning is that China's economic growth is continuing to slowdown, but no worst \u2013 officially at least \u2013 than economists had expected. Chinese GDP grew by 7.5% on an annual basis between April and June, the second consecutive quarter of slowing growth. Analysts reckon the data, released overnight, shows that Beijing could miss its target 7.5% growth for the whole of 2013. With Europe struggling for growth and some emerging markets stumbling, even 7.5% would be the lowest rate of expansion in more than two decades. Xianfang Ren, economist at IHS Global Insight, warned: As of now, China's gross domestic product has been staying under 8% for five straight quarters, a clear sign of distress The rather sharp growth deceleration and the recent financial market turmoil indicate that risks have been building on both the financial and real goods sector. Industrial production figures for June also showed less growth than a year ago, adding to fears that the second-largest economy is weakening in the face of a lacklustre global economy and a crackdown on its shadow banking sector. If China's economy really stumbles, the effects will be felt worldwide \u2013 potentially hurting the eurozone's attempts to claw its way back to growth. Credit Agricole's Dariusz Kowalczyk reckons China may need to launch fresh stimulus meaures, predicting: We will see some targeted measures to stimulate growth. The Bejing government has already scrambled to 'correct' a report that finance minister Lou Jiwei had said the country\u2019s growth target this year is 7%. Bloomberg has the details: In an English-language story released yesterday and dated July 12, Xinhua [the official Chinese news agency] said it corrected a quote attributed to Lou to \u201cthere is no doubt that China can achieve this year\u2019s growth target of 7.5 percent\u201d from its original story dated July 11 that cited him as saying \u201cthere is no doubt that China can achieve the growth target, though the 7 percent goal should not be considered as the bottom line.\u201d Hope that clears up any doubts. Meanwhile in Europe..... political instability threatens to reignite the eurozone debt crisis. Portugal remains a serious concern, after opposition head Ant\u00f3nio Jos\u00e9 Seguro called for an end to its austerity programme on Friday night, and a renegotiation of its bailout programme. While in Spain, prime minister Mariano Rajoy is facing fresh calls to resign over the illicit payments scandal that has rocked the country in recent months. I'll be watching for news from Lisbon and Madrid, along with reaction to China's slowing economy and other developments throughout the day....",

      "body": "<p>UK companies are at their most optimistic since the onset of the financial crisis, bucking a worldwide trend that has seen business confidence drop in most other big economies.</p> <p>According to the latest global business outlook survey from Markit, the UK has shaken off the global gloom thanks to a jump in confidence among service companies. That sector, which covers an array of businesses such as hairdressers, restaurants, insurers and lawyers, enjoyed a jump in optimism to a six-year high.</p> <p>In the smaller manufacturing sector, confidence about business activity in the year ahead was also relatively strong, holding at a two-year high.</p> <p>Markit, a financial information company, said the optimism in the UK contrasted with many other economies, particularly China and the US where confidence has dropped sharply in recent months.</p> <p>\"The UK ... is undergoing a period of solid and increasingly sustainable-looking economic growth,\" said Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit.</p> <p>\"Expansion is being led by the service sector, where business optimism has surged to the highest since late-2006. Even manufacturing is seeing the brightest outlook for two years.

      "bodyText": "UK companies are at their most optimistic since the onset of the financial crisis, bucking a worldwide trend that has seen business confidence drop in most other big economies. According to the latest global business outlook survey from Markit, the UK has shaken off the global gloom thanks to a jump in confidence among service companies. That sector, which covers an array of businesses such as hairdressers, restaurants, insurers and lawyers, enjoyed a jump in optimism to a six-year high. In the smaller manufacturing sector, confidence about business activity in the year ahead was also relatively strong, holding at a two-year high. Markit, a financial information company, said the optimism in the UK contrasted with many other economies, particularly China and the US where confidence has dropped sharply in recent months. \"The UK ... is undergoing a period of solid and increasingly sustainable-looking economic growth,\" said Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit. \"Expansion is being led by the service sector, where business optimism has surged to the highest since late-2006. Even manufacturing is seeing the brightest outlook for two years. Exporters are benefiting from sterling's depreciation, which is offsetting worries about slower growth in many key export markets.\" The bright outlook chimes with comments that the UK's recovery has \"finally got legs\" from respected forecasting body the Ernst &amp; Young Item Club. It almost doubled its forecast for growth this year to 1.1%, up from 0.6% just three months ago. There was more upbeat economic news from the UK in a report showing the number of companies in financial distress dropped sharply in the second quarter. Businesses in a \"critical\" condition fell 39% to 3,001 between April and June compared with the same period a year earlier, according to a report by restructuring specialist Begbies Traynor. Markit's survey, covering 11,000 companies around the world, found that globally confidence had deteriorated in recent months. It was back at a post-financial crisis low, according to the report's confidence balance, which measures the difference in companies expecting growth in business activity versus those expecting a drop. Falling from 39% in February to 30% now, the balance matched last October's level \u2013 the lowest since the survey started in late 2009, when the global economy was pulling out of recession. On top of pressure from gloom in the US and China, there were also falls in confidence in the eurozone and Japan, Markit said. \"The eurozone remains a weak spot in the global picture, though far less so than late last year. However, while there are signs of rising optimism in the periphery, notably Spain and Ireland, the mood in France and Germany remains subdued compared with earlier in the recovery, which will restrain the overall pace of economic recovery for the region,\" said Williamson. The news of dwindling confidence in China echoes official data overnight that confirmed an expected slowdown in economic growth there. Markit said service companies were their least optimistic since late 2007, \"meaning optimism in the sector is even weaker than at the height of the global financial crisis.\" Manufacturers were also less optimistic, though that measure only fell back to its lowest since October 2011. \"Views on future business revenues, new business inflows and profits all deteriorated compared to earlier in the year in China,\" Markit's report said. The official numbers showed Chinese GDP grew by 7.5% on an annual basis between April and June, the second consecutive quarter of slowing growth. Analysts said the data shows that Beijing could miss its target 7.5% growth for the whole of 2013. Industrial production figures for June also showed less growth than a year ago, adding to fears that the second-largest economy is weakening in the face of a lacklustre global economy and a crackdown on its shadow banking sector.",

      "bodyText": "The number of companies in financial distress dropped sharply in the second quarter, in the latest sign of improvement in the wider economy. Businesses in a \"critical\" condition fell 39% to 3,001 between April and June compared with the same period a year earlier, according to a report by restructuring specialist Begbies Traynor. Julie Palmer, a partner at Begbies, said it was the \"first real sign that the UK economy has turned a corner towards a sustained recovery\". She warned however the worst may yet be to come for so-called zombie businesses, which are smaller companies that have survived the recession but are chronically underfunded and do not have sufficient cash to take advantage of a recovery. \"We have real fears that many small and medium-sized enterprises will have serious financial difficulties at the time they least expect - during a recovery. \"Our experience has shown time and time again that many SMEs run out of cash during the recovery phase, as there is a real temptation to overtrade,\" Palmer said. The Begbies red flag report, which monitors early signs of financial distress among companies, said that businesses in critical distress also fell 9% in the second quarter compared with the first. It added that distress levels fell most sharply in the construction, professional services, and financial services sectors, while manufacturing also improved on the back of increased demand both at home at abroad. Separate data has supported the picture of a strengthening UK services sector, but manufacturing has performed below economists' expectations. However, official figures to be published on 25 July are still expected to show that economic growth accelerated in the second quarter to about 0.6% from 0.3% in the first quarter. Begbies Traynor said that businesses depending on discretionary consumer spending were among those to see some of the biggest rises in critical financial distress levels, including hotels, bars and restaurants. \"The consumer-facing industries continue to struggle as shoppers maintain tight control over their purse strings at a time when disposable income has remained under pressure,\" Palmer said.",

Cigars all round?</p> <p>Alas no.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/grogonomics/2013/jul/11/unemployment-figures-whole-story\">Last week</a> we noted that the unemployment rate hides important details; this is magnified when it comes to youth unemployment.

      "bodyText": "The most recent unemployment figures have revealed a problem with youth unemployment that has for the most part been hidden by the traditional \u201cyouth unemployment\u201d rate. The June labour force figures released by the ABS last week showed that the unemployment rate for 15-24 year olds (the standard definition of youth unemployment) was 11.7% (in trend terms), slightly below where it was this time last year. For 15-19 year olds it is 15.6% \u2013 more than one percentage point lower than the 16.7% of June 2012. So the rate is coming down. Cigars all round? Alas no. Last week we noted that the unemployment rate hides important details; this is magnified when it comes to youth unemployment. What has been noticeable of late is the unemployment rate of those looking for full-time work has surged, while the overall rate has stayed flat or declined. There is now a bigger gap between the two rates than at any time in the past 20 years: And yet despite this there is actually a smaller percentage of youth looking for full-time work than there was during the height of the global financial crisis. So what is going on? There are two issues: participation and jobs. First participation. For young people, especially those between the ages of 15 and 19, there is a clear alternative to participating in the labour force: education. And what we have seen is that since the GFC, more youth have been staying in the education system rather than entering the labour market. For most of the 2000s up to the middle of 2008, around 26% of all 15-19 year olds were studying full-time and neither working nor looking for work. When the GFC hit, that changed and in the past five years the percentage has fairly zoomed up to over 40% \u2013 a level not seen since the early 1990s recession. Now this is not necessarily a bad thing. They are staying in school and learning skills. But it does suggest that fewer are obtaining skills on the job \u2013 either as an apprentice or in an entry-level job. The ALP remains extremely focused on trades training and keeping youth in school, so to an extent this is a vindication of their policy. But you can\u2019t stay in school forever, which brings us to jobs. Young people are always hit harder by downturns than the rest of the adult population. Because they are less experienced, and thus often less productive, young full-time employees are often the first let go during times of economic downturn. This means that full-time youth employment growth can actually be a bit of a canary in the mine for the broader economy. This was certainly the case during the GFC when full-time youth employment began falling severely at a time when employment for those over 25 was still increasing: The problem of youth unemployment is best displayed by the fact that currently a smaller percentage of 15-to-24 year olds are working than at any time since 1997. In the past three months only around 59.1% of youth have been in any type of employment \u2013 more than 1.5% fewer than in June 2009 when the economy was hit hardest by the GFC. And yet the youth unemployment rate is actually now better than it was then. So looking at the youth unemployment rate actually can give a distorted image \u2013 the picture of the past five years since 2008 has not been about youth unemployment \u2013 but youth employment. This is made clear when we compare the employment to population ratios of youth to that of those in the \u201cprime working age\u201d of 25-54: For most of the past 20 years, the level of young people in employment has grown at around the same pace as that of the prime-age workers. But while the percentage of prime-age workers has increased since the GFC (and is just below the record high of early 2011) the level of youth in employment has fallen off a cliff. The reason youth unemployment hasn\u2019t risen in the past year the way the overall adult population rate has is because young people are responding to the economic downturn not by staying unemployed, but by staying out of the labour force and remaining either in school or a vocational education. The Liberal party\u2019s employment participation spokesperson Sussan Ley said early this month that the Liberal party\u2019s policy was to \u201csuspend the welfare payments of young people after six months in areas where there are available unskilled and unfilled jobs\u201d. But this suggests a punishment for an attitude not in existence. Indeed, the average duration of youth unemployment has followed much the same path as that of all other age groups. The policy settings for youth employment needed at the moment aren\u2019t so much about getting kids off unemployment as about getting them into the labour force in the first place. And the issue of keeping them in their jobs as well remains paramount. At present annual full-time youth employment is falling at around 5%, while employment of those over 25 remains positive. History suggests, however, that when youth employment drops, sooner or later it drops for everyone else.",
