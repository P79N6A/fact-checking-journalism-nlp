      "bodyText": "The CBI has raised its forecast for UK economic growth this year to 1.2% \u2013 double the pace predicted by George Osborne in his March budget \u2013 as the business lobbying group cited mounting confidence across the British economy. It becomes the latest organisation to raise its outlook for the UK after a series of surveys and official data have suggested green shoots of recovery are taking hold, prompting the CBI to raise its 2013 growth estimate from 1%. However, the CBI, which has long been a supporter of the government's austerity drive and promises to cut the deficit, sounded a note of caution as it warned that ministers' push for a rebalancing away from consumption is taking longer than expected. \"The economy has started to gain momentum and confidence is picking up, but it's still early days,\" said John Cridland, the CBI's director general. \"We need to see a full-blown rebalancing of our economy, with stronger business investment and trade before we can call a sustainable recovery. We hope that will begin to emerge next year, as the eurozone starts growing again.\" Government statistics published today show signs of a rebalancing, or at least the impact of austerity measures on public sector jobs, with private sector employment at its highest in 15 years at 24.1 million people. The CBI said there were \"signs of a pick-up in confidence across a broad range of sectors, including services, construction and manufacturing\". For 2014, the group is now pencilling 2.3% growth, up from May's forecast of 2%. Leading thinktank, the National Institute for Economic and Social Research, and forecasters Fathom Consulting both upgraded their outlook for the UK economy earlier this month to 1.2%. That growth is based on a rise in disposable incomes and some support from exports as the eurozone continues to recover following a protracted recession that was finally confirmed over last week. Official UK data on Friday is expected to add to the tentatively optimistic tone, confirming economic growth accelerated in the second quarter to 0.6%, double the pace in the first three months of this year. That would be unchanged from the number the Office for National Statistics estimated in its first take on GDP for the quarter, which was welcomed by the chancellor as showing the economy has moved \"out of intensive care\". A handful of economists believe growth could be revised higher on Friday to 0.7%. Among them, Philip Shaw at Investec, notes that numbers from the construction sector have been revised up since that first estimate on growth and that the performance of the dominant services is also likely to be nudged up. \"Our 2013 GDP forecast is still +1.2%, but we are tempted to upgrade this modestly given the positive data dynamics recorded recently,\" he added. But many economists share the CBI's concern that the economy remains overly dependent on consumers, who account for around two-thirds of all spending. They say consumers are not in a strong position to drive a recovery as they grapple with the biggest squeeze on household budgets for decades. There is fresh evidence of that pressure on Monday. The latest Asda Income Tracker suggests disposable household incomes fell last month as wages failed to keep pace with living costs. The supermarket chain says the average UK household had \u00a3160 a week of disposable income in July, down \u00a31 a week from a year earlier and \u00a35 a week from a peak in February 2010. It blamed energy bills for burning a hole in household budgets after they rose by 8.2% over the past year. \"A 'feel-good' summer has contributed to a boost in retail sales, but we can't ignore the fact that the squeeze on income growth and rising cost of living continue to pull at consumer purse strings,\" said Asda chief executive Andy Clarke. But he noted a rise in consumer optimism, nonetheless. That chimes with a separate survey suggesting households spent more in August as they reported that access to unsecured loans improved and they were relatively upbeat about their finances. Data company Markit, said the measure of financial wellbeing in its Household Finance Index dipped \"only slightly\" from July's record high. It stood at 40.8 in August, down from 41.5 in July, the highest since the survey was launch in early 2009. Still, there were contrasting feelings around the country. \"The strains on finances are receding fastest among those in private sector service jobs, while those working in construction, retail and the public sector trail behind. On a regional basis, familiar trends continued in August as people in Scotland and the south of England were the least downbeat about their finances, while those in Wales and the north of England were among the most pessimistic,\" said Tim Moore, senior economist at Markit. Growing evidence of a renewed pick-up in house prices has also boosted sentiment among homeowners but at the same time prompted warnings that Britain could be headed for a damaging property boom and bust. Property website Rightmove is the latest to report rising house price inflation on Monday, adding to a flurry of recent surveys that reignited criticism of government schemes to kickstart the housing market. Average asking prices are up by more than \u00a320,000 so far in 2013 and stood at \u00a3249,199 in August, Rightmove said. As is typical for August, that marked a slight dip from July but at 1.8% the holiday season fall was less than in previous years. In annual terms house price inflation accelerated to 5.5% from 4.8% growth in July. The average asking price for flats hit a record high of \u00a3209,652 in August, Rightmove said, as it joined the chorus of warnings over government schemes. \"Flats are most in demand by first-time buyers and buy-to-let investors and we have seen prices for this property type hit their highest ever level as supply fails to keep up with an increase in demand at the bottom of the market,\" said Rightmove director Miles Shipside. \"Demand is already on the up, and that's before the roll-out of phase two of the Help to Buy stimulus. It is now critical that the supply of property improves so that the goal of a significant increase in transaction numbers is not over-shadowed by an unsustainable boom in property prices.\"",

      "bodyText": "A contender for 315 Royal Bank of Scotland branches will float on the London stock market this week in the hope of raising \u00a315m to support its bid. News that W&amp;G Investments, fronted by former Tesco finance director Andrew Higginson, has secured the backing of more than 10 fund managers and hedge funds comes as a report shows the UK banking sector is \"starting to get back on track\" after the financial crisis. KPMG, the accounting firm behind the report, said all five major UK banks were in profit for the first time since 2010. Signs of health in a sector that has been reeling from the Libor scandal and other setbacks are reflected in the interest in the branches being sold by RBS. W&amp;G Investments, poised to float on the Aim market, faces two rival bids. One is from a consortium backed by the Church of England and by former Lloyds Banking Group banker John Maltby, who has been lined up as chief executive. The other is led by former HSBC banker Alan Hughes and is backed by private equity firms AnaCap and Blackstone. The bidders are expected to revive the Williams &amp; Glyn's brand that disappeared from high streets in 1986 and is being re-created by RBS to facilitate the sale, which was demanded by the European commission as a condition for approving the taxpayer funds pumped into RBS during the banking crisis. RBS, which had hoped to sell the branches to Santander before the Spanish bank pulled out, could yet decide to float the branches itself. Consumer groups are likely to welcome a new player on the high street amid worries that competition has fallen away. KPMG's report claims the crisis has left \"a lot less choice for individuals\". Its latest analysis of the performance at Barclays, HSBC, Lloyds Banking Group, RBS and Standard Chartered found that while all five were in profit in the first half of the year, their earnings continued to be dented by fines and compensation costs for the mis-selling of payment protection insurance (PPI). Overall lending was up and customer deposits grew by 6%, but shareholders were failing to get the returns they had grown used to before the crash. \"Return on equity has roughly halved compared to 2005 levels, from near 20% to under 10% now \u2013 and this looks unlikely to reverse in the near-term,\" said the bank performance benchmarking report. \"Banks are safer but much less profitable per shareholder pound.\" Combined first-half profits for the five were \u00a316.5bn but that figure would have been almost 20% higher were it not for the continuing need to set money aside against PPI claims (\u00a32.3bn) and interest rate hedging products (\u00a3700m).

    "fields": {
      "standfirst": "Phone group's royalties offshoot in Ireland employed no one but had \u20ac380m turnover", 
      "body": "<p>It is an association that has draped Vodafone's red ensign across racing racks from Silverstone to Shanghai. The British mobile phone group's longstanding involvement with Formula One, through multimillion-pound sponsorship deals with Ferrari and then McLaren, has helped make its brand world famous.</p> <p>But few of Vodafone's customers will be aware that, for four years, the marketing of these high-profile sponsorship deals was run not from its headquarters in the English market town of Newbury but from a satellite office in Dublin.</p> <p>In 2002, Vodafone began using a Dublin-based subsidiary, Vodafone Ireland Marketing, to collect royalties and brand management fees from operating companies and joint venture partners doing business under the British brand. The collections were made from countries around the world \u2013 with the exception of the UK and Italy.</p> <p>The sums collected grew steadily. In 2006, after reviewing royalty rates paid in other industries, Vodafone's royalties went up from 0.7% to 1.75%. By 2007, Vodafone Ireland Marketing Ltd, a company employing no staff and registered to an industrial estate in the Dublin suburb of Leopardstown, reported a turnover of \u20ac380m (\u00a3325m) a year.</p> <p>Eventually, Vodafone decided that the Dublin subsidiary should employ staff, and told certain members of its global marketing team, based in Newbury and London, that they would have to relocate to Ireland.</p> <p>By September 2007, global director of brand customer experience David Wheldon, now a Barclays executive, had agreed to move and head the new team. Global chief marketing officer Frank R\u00f6vekamp, while remaining in London, became a director of Vodafone Ireland Marketing. It was decided the Dublin team would oversee international advertising accounts, and Vodafone's big sponsorship deals including Formula One, the Champions League and the Ashes cricket Test series.</p> <p>Two former Vodafone marketing staff, who spoke to the Guardian on condition of anonymity, said the request to move came out of the blue. \"Suddenly, within a very short period of time, the team were uprooted from the base in London to Dublin,\" said one employee. \"Everything was sorted out really, really quickly.\"</p> <p>No reason for the move was given in writing, staff said, but in background conversations with managers, employees were given to understand it was important for tax reasons to show that brand marketing activity was taking place in the same country \u2013 Ireland \u2013 as the brand royalties were being collected.</p> <p>\". Vodafone never told us in an official way why the team had to moveEverything was handled with lawyers, and HR was clearly instructed by the legal team as to what they were allowed to say,\" according to the source. \"Clearly this was a very important financial move for Vodafone, because the team was offered lucrative relocation packages to move to Dublin. They were treated quite royally. There was no financial reason other than if the team hadn't moved they would have exposed themselves to a huge tax liability.\"</p> <p>Despite the generous incentives, the move had its human costs. From a team of 20 earmarked for transfer to Ireland, only a handful made the move.</p> <p>The second source said: \"It was quite clear: go to Dublin and go quickly or here's your redundancy. It's fair to say morale was pretty awful at the time, some of them hadn't been there that long, people with families.\"</p> <p>Asked about the reason for the relocation, the company said in a statement: \"Vodafone's group brand and marketing function was established during a period of significant international expansion. Vodafone is a global business, and it is therefore feasible to locate centralised group functions in a number of different locations depending on a range of factors. Dublin was identified as a location for this activity on a number of grounds including the commercial, regulatory and tax environment in Ireland at that time.\"</p> <p>The Irish accounts illustrate one important advantage: if the firm could show it was \"carrying out trading activities\" from Dublin, the corporation tax rate would be halved.</p> <p>According to the 2008 company filings: \"Following the establishment of the global brand management function in Ireland the activities of the company have increased. A confirmation has been obtained from the Irish Revenue that the company is now carrying out trading activities and, accordingly, subject to the corporate tax rate of 12.5%.\" The rate would apply from 1 November 2007.</p> <p>While the Irish tax authorities were accommodating, HM Revenue and Customs raised objections to Vodafone's previous arrangements.

      "bodyText": "It is an association that has draped Vodafone's red ensign across racing racks from Silverstone to Shanghai. The British mobile phone group's longstanding involvement with Formula One, through multimillion-pound sponsorship deals with Ferrari and then McLaren, has helped make its brand world famous. But few of Vodafone's customers will be aware that, for four years, the marketing of these high-profile sponsorship deals was run not from its headquarters in the English market town of Newbury but from a satellite office in Dublin. In 2002, Vodafone began using a Dublin-based subsidiary, Vodafone Ireland Marketing, to collect royalties and brand management fees from operating companies and joint venture partners doing business under the British brand. The collections were made from countries around the world \u2013 with the exception of the UK and Italy. The sums collected grew steadily. In 2006, after reviewing royalty rates paid in other industries, Vodafone's royalties went up from 0.7% to 1.75%. By 2007, Vodafone Ireland Marketing Ltd, a company employing no staff and registered to an industrial estate in the Dublin suburb of Leopardstown, reported a turnover of \u20ac380m (\u00a3325m) a year. Eventually, Vodafone decided that the Dublin subsidiary should employ staff, and told certain members of its global marketing team, based in Newbury and London, that they would have to relocate to Ireland. By September 2007, global director of brand customer experience David Wheldon, now a Barclays executive, had agreed to move and head the new team. Global chief marketing officer Frank R\u00f6vekamp, while remaining in London, became a director of Vodafone Ireland Marketing. It was decided the Dublin team would oversee international advertising accounts, and Vodafone's big sponsorship deals including Formula One, the Champions League and the Ashes cricket Test series. Two former Vodafone marketing staff, who spoke to the Guardian on condition of anonymity, said the request to move came out of the blue. \"Suddenly, within a very short period of time, the team were uprooted from the base in London to Dublin,\" said one employee. \"Everything was sorted out really, really quickly.\" No reason for the move was given in writing, staff said, but in background conversations with managers, employees were given to understand it was important for tax reasons to show that brand marketing activity was taking place in the same country \u2013 Ireland \u2013 as the brand royalties were being collected. \". Vodafone never told us in an official way why the team had to moveEverything was handled with lawyers, and HR was clearly instructed by the legal team as to what they were allowed to say,\" according to the source. \"Clearly this was a very important financial move for Vodafone, because the team was offered lucrative relocation packages to move to Dublin. They were treated quite royally. There was no financial reason other than if the team hadn't moved they would have exposed themselves to a huge tax liability.\" Despite the generous incentives, the move had its human costs. From a team of 20 earmarked for transfer to Ireland, only a handful made the move. The second source said: \"It was quite clear: go to Dublin and go quickly or here's your redundancy. It's fair to say morale was pretty awful at the time, some of them hadn't been there that long, people with families.\" Asked about the reason for the relocation, the company said in a statement: \"Vodafone's group brand and marketing function was established during a period of significant international expansion. Vodafone is a global business, and it is therefore feasible to locate centralised group functions in a number of different locations depending on a range of factors. Dublin was identified as a location for this activity on a number of grounds including the commercial, regulatory and tax environment in Ireland at that time.\" The Irish accounts illustrate one important advantage: if the firm could show it was \"carrying out trading activities\" from Dublin, the corporation tax rate would be halved. According to the 2008 company filings: \"Following the establishment of the global brand management function in Ireland the activities of the company have increased. A confirmation has been obtained from the Irish Revenue that the company is now carrying out trading activities and, accordingly, subject to the corporate tax rate of 12.5%.\" The rate would apply from 1 November 2007. While the Irish tax authorities were accommodating, HM Revenue and Customs raised objections to Vodafone's previous arrangements. Its Irish tax payments were challenged in a dispute that was eventually settled in March 2009. Vodafone said the settlement related to a number of years prior to 2007. It declined to say how much was paid to HMRC but accounts show it eventually claimed back \u20ac67m from the Irish government, which was then handed to Britain \"as part of the overall settlement\". This settlement, which has never been mentioned separately in Vodafone's annual reports, or discussed publicly by the company , was entirely separate from the \u00a31.25bn Vodafone paid HMRC in 2010 after a long dispute over its activities in Luxembourg. A spokesman for HMRC declined to confirm the grounds for its challenge, the sum claimed back from Vodafone, or even that a settlement was made. HMRC is by law prevented from discussing the affairs of individual taxpayers. Vodafone says HMRC has made no allegation of wrongdoing on its part. The dispute, it says, \"related to a number of technical factors regarding inter-group transfer pricing arrangements\". This refers to charges paid between sister companies \u2013 in this case Vodafone's royalty payments \u2013 which are used to transfer taxable profits from one country to another. In October 2011, Vodafone made an about-turn, and the marketing team was ordered to return to Britain. The Irish brand subsidiary was wound down, and according to a company spokesman its activities have transferred to a UK company that pays all its profits into the British plc and is taxed under UK rules. Vodafone's Irish adventure was not an entirely bruising experience. Before it closed, the Dublin office paid more than \u20ac1.04bn (\u00a3900m) in dividends during a four-year period to a parent company, Vodafone Investments Luxembourg Sarl \u2013 based in the low-tax jurisdiction of Luxembourg.",

      "bodyText": "Australia always take defeat hard and to go into this week's final Ashes test at the Oval three down with one to play is a bitter pill to swallow. But while those wearing the \"baggy green\" have been losing at Trent Bridge, Lords and Chester-le-Street, the Aussies have at least been able to take comfort from an economy that in recent years has out-muscled the old country in the way that the cricket team did when it was led by Steve Waugh. The golden years for Australian cricket ended a decade ago. Decline was hard to spot initially although the warning signs were there: a lack of suitable replacements for great players and too great a focus on one-day cricket that resulted in sides being less familiar with the five-day format. It may prove to be a similar story with the economy. Australia was one of the few developed economies to emerge from the global recession largely unscathed. Growth has been good for a quarter of a century, public debt is low, the banking system proved resilient during the financial crisis and it is one of only a handful of countries that still retains a AAA credit rating. Success initially was based on some important structural reforms to labour markets and to welfare policy, coupled with macro-economic policies that used inflation targeting to keep increases in the cost of living in check. Australia's banks were better capitalised than those in Europe or the US when the crisis broke. These reforms in the late 1980s and early 1990s coincided with China's emergence as a global economic superpower. China needed raw materials \u2013 coal, iron ore, aluminium \u2013 for its rapid industrial expansion and Australia had them in abundance. China now takes 40% of Australian exports. As a result, Australia was the Ireland of the antipodes. Both countries put in place supply-side reforms designed to boost growth and both had access to a huge market. Ireland's 20 years of expansion can be neatly divided into two phases: the first decade in which growth was the result of getting the fundamentals right at a time when multinationals were looking for a European base; and a bubble decade of wild property speculation and irresponsible lending. Before looking at why Australia could go the same way, it is worth looking at the way in which the global economy has evolved over the past five years. In the days before the financial crisis, there were three groups of countries. In the first category were the workshop nations, the ones that produced the cars, the clothes, the machine tools, the TV sets and the toys. Low-cost countries such as China fell into this category, but so did high-cost countries such as Germany. In the second category were the debtor nations. These countries bought all the goods churned out by the workshop nations, running up big current account deficits in the process. The United States and the United Kingdom were prime examples of debtor nations: levels of private debt exploded to allow consumers to live beyond their means. Finally, there were the resource-rich countries. Some of these were the oil-rich nations of the Middle East; others included Russia and two important developed countries \u2013 Canada and Australia. All these countries did nicely out of a global economy in which China was growing at 10% a year and the US was acting as the spender of last resort. In the four years before the sky fell in, global growth averaged around 5% a year \u2013 its strongest since the latter years of the post-war boom. But this model has now collapsed and 5% global growth now looks like an aberration. In the US, growth is struggling to rise above 2% despite the extraordinary stimulus provided by the Federal Reserve. Wall Street fully expects the Fed to start \"tapering\" its bond-buying under the quantitative easing programme next month, and that has already had an impact on some emerging countries \u2013 such as India. The notion that the US is easing back on electronic money creation has strengthened the dollar and sent the rupee down to a record low. That is unhelpful to policymakers in New Delhi battling against already strong inflationary pressures, since it makes imports dearer. But if India is struggling to adjust to the new normal so too is China. With the US less willing to buy up everything Chinese factories produce, the new leadership in Beijing has worked out that it might not be sensible for investment to make up 50% of the nation's output. But the transition to an economy less dependent on investment and exports is likely to be slow and fitful. One thing is certain: the days when the emerging world was expanding at 9% a year, as those countries did at their peak in 2010, are now over. Neil Shearing at Capital Economics estimates that emerging economies are currently growing at an annual rate of 4%. All this has obvious implications for those countries heavily dependent on exports of energy and raw materials, such as Australia, where the mining industry has doubled its share of national output to 10% in less than a decade. Exports relating to exploitation of natural resources account for 60% of the total and while the mining sector has growth by 7.5% over the past decade the rest of the Australian economy has expanded by around 2.5%. Australia now bears all the hallmarks of a country where its industrial base has hollowed out. The decision by Ford Australia to close its manufacturing plants at Broadmeadows and Geelong is evidence of what economists call Dutch disease: a natural resource boom drives up the exchange rate and makes all other exports deeply uncompetitive. With the outlook for the global economy far less rosy than it was, the mining sector is also cutting back on investment. That has left the economy propped up by the one remaining source of growth \u2013 an overvalued real estate market. As the economist John Llewellyn has pointed out, household debt in Australia rose sharply in the 1990s and 2000s and now stands at 150% of GDP. Noting that the housing market may already be in bubble territory, he adds: \"Depending on a strong pickup in housing as a means to sustain growth and rebalance the economy would therefore appear to be fraught with danger. The risk is of unsustainable boom followed by destabilising bust, with considerable collateral damage to both financial and non-financial private sector balance sheets.\" The Reserve Bank of Australia is now cutting interest rates and talking down the currency in an attempt to rebalance the economy. That is easier said than done when your economy amounts to a large hole in the ground ringed by some expensive property. The risk is of a sudden Aussie collapse of the sort that has become all too familiar on English cricket grounds this summer.",
