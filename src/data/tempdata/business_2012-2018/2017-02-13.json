      "bodyText": "Pharmaceutical company Kal\u00e9o \u2013 already under fire for raising the price of an overdose antidote \u2013 now plans to put an alternative to the EpiPen on the market for more than seven times the cost of the leading $608 drug. Kal\u00e9o\u2019s epinephrine injector, used to stop severe allergic reactions, will go on sale for $4,500 for a pack of two beginning on 14 February. The auto-injector\u2019s innovative audio instructions walk caregivers through administering less than $5 worth of epinephrine. Remarkably, because of a system of coupons and discounts, Kal\u00e9o\u2019s epinephrine injector Auvi-Q may have the lowest out-of-pocket costs for patients, a strategy some critics say may help some customers, but leads insurance companies to redistribute the cost of the drug through insurance fees to remain profitable. \u201cIt\u2019s a brilliant auto-injector \u2013 is it fair to say it\u2019s worth $4,000 itself? That\u2019s $3,000 more than your iPhone, and you can only use it once,\u201d said Dr Joseph Ross, an associate professor of medicine at Yale University who has written about drug pricing for the New England Journal of Medicine. \u201cIt\u2019s tricky to know what\u2019s the right price, what\u2019s a fair price.\u201d This is not the first time that Auvi-Q will be on the market. The drug was pulled in 2015 after 26 auto-injectors malfunctioned, and delivered inconsistent doses of epinephrine. In 2015, the cost of Auvi-Q was about $450, according to CNBC. The company has since said publicly that those problems have been fixed. Kal\u00e9o did not respond to multiple requests for comment from the Guardian. Kal\u00e9o has patents on just two products \u2013 Auvi-Q and Evzio, another auto-injector which delivers the antidote naloxone to people overdosing on drugs like heroin or opiates. Both auto-injectors deliver life-saving generic drugs to patients using audio recordings to walk people through the injection process. Both are now priced at $4,500. Evzio\u2019s price shot up from $690 beginning in November 2015 \u2013 a 552% increase, according to Express Scripts, which helps administer prescription drug benefits for health insurers. Auvi-Q, before it was pulled from the market, was priced in the same range, according to media reports. The price of both drugs increased just as Kal\u00e9o was in the midst of a faltering, multimillion-dollar deal with French drug giant Sanofi. In media reports, however, Kal\u00e9o contends that the high list price of its injectors allows it to give greater discounts to patients, lowering out-of-pocket cost while insurance companies foot the bill. \u201cWe believe the prices for Auvi-Q and Evzio are egregious and are another example of how some drug makers try to get around formulary management tools that help save payers and patients money,\u201d said Jennifer Luddy, a spokeswoman for Express Scripts, which excluded the drugs from some of its plans. Twin brothers Eric and Evan Edwards, now a doctor and an engineer, invented the voice instruction auto-injectors after growing up with severe allergies. Eric Edwards called them the \u201cmost allergic children ever\u201d, in a Richmond Magazine article. After developing the epinephrine injector Auvi-Q, the pair went on to develop the naloxone injector Evzio. \u201cIt\u2019s our hope to play a small role in reversing the tides of hospitalizations and deaths that are plaguing this country,\u201d Eric Edwards told Dr Mehmet Oz, host of the Dr Oz show, in an appearance to promote a donation of 50,000 auto-injectors to US health and human services. Eric Edwards told Richmond Magazine that he considered his and his brother\u2019s pharmaceutical company a way to use his \u201cGod given talent\u201d. However, critics contend Kal\u00e9o\u2019s high prices prevent Evzio from reaching the people who need it most. Despite rising drug overdoses, prescription growth for naloxone has been relatively slow, which a group of Yale physicians including Ross attribute to its rising cost. \u201cTo me that seems like a very backwards pricing model,\u201d said Ross. \u201cWhy would you continue to charge more and more, pricing the product out of the hands of more and more users, regardless of whether or not they have insurance, essentially justifying, \u2018If we charge more we\u2019ll be able to give away more\u2019?\u201d Wholesale generic naloxone costs between $15 and $17, depending on the dosage. Narcan, a nasal spray, has also raised its price, but still remains in the $120 to $200 range. \u201cThe generic versions of [naloxone] are going to be far cheaper than what they\u2019re charging,\u201d said Jennifer Luddy, a spokeswoman for Express Scripts, about Evzio. \u201cThe generic version are probably only around $100.\u201d \u201cEvzio is the same drug \u2013 it\u2019s just the delivery,\u201d Luddy said, referring to Evzio\u2019s talking auto-injector. Naloxone in particular has been difficult for community-based organizations to share with lay people who might witness an overdose. Between 1996 and 2014, community-based organizations distributed at least 152,000 naloxone doses, according to an article in the Journal of the American Medical Association. Aimee Dunkle, a mother whose son overdosed, she made it her mission to distribute naloxone \u2013 a drug that could have saved his life \u2013 far and wide. She told the Guardian in February, simply, that \u201cThere\u2019s never enough.\u201d Notably, Evzio was not always $4,500. The drug was once priced at the comparatively modest $690. Evzio\u2019s price increase followed a faltering deal with Sanofi when the company\u2019s other product, Auvi-Q, was the subject of a broad recall. Sanofi licensed Auvi-Q in 2009 from Kal\u00e9o, a deal worth at least $230m, including an upfront payment of $25m, according to the Richmond Times Dispatch. Auvi-Q became Kal\u00e9o\u2019s first FDA-approved product in 2012, and was innovative for its audio recording that talked caregivers through giving an injection. According to CNBC, the drug cost about $450 at that time. But in October 2015, reports emerged of faulty auto-injectors which could fail to deliver the right dose of epinephrine. Sanofi issued a voluntary total recall, which cost as much as $110m, according to an industry publication. In February 2016, Sanofi ended its agreement with Kal\u00e9o. But Kal\u00e9o had already financed the expansion of its second FDA-approved auto-injector, Evzio, using the royalties it expected from Auvi-Q. Kal\u00e9o took out a $150m loan from a third company, PDL Biopharma, underwriting the debt with 100% of its Auvi-Q royalties, and 10% of net sales of Evzio, according to PDL\u2019s Securities and Exchange Commission filings. With Auvi-Q off the market, Kal\u00e9o had to rely exclusively on income from Evzio. By the middle of 2016, Kal\u00e9o had depleted a $20m reserve, set aside as part of the financing deal with PDL. Meanwhile, from November 2015 to March 2016, Kal\u00e9o increased the list price of Evzio 552% to $4,500, according to Express Scripts. \u201cEvzio business is growing at a very attractive trajectory,\u201d Kal\u00e9o\u2019s CEO, Spencer Williamson, told the Richmond Times Dispatch in April 2016. \u201cWe have no money coming in from Auvi-Q right now while it is off the market. So we\u2019re working to bring that product back. We\u2019re blessed to be in a strong financial position.\u201d In the past, Kal\u00e9o\u2019s vice-president, Mark Herzog, has claimed to the Guardian that the high price of Evzio is required to ensure anyone with a prescription could obtain the drug. He argues that by keeping the cost of its drug high for insurers, Kal\u00e9o can offer a variety of discounts to consumers. That is because Kal\u00e9o is among the many pharmaceutical companies that offer to cover co-pays \u2013 typically small out-of-pocket payments customers make at the pharmacy for a prescription. That may sound benevolent, but critics contend it drives up the overall cost of healthcare, and thereby insurance. The practice is considered so detrimental to healthcare costs that lawmakers in California are considering whether to make it illegal. That is because insurance companies use co-pays to negotiate with drugmakers. How? Insurance companies offer to charge lower co-pays to consumers at the pharmacy for a drugmaker\u2019s product, if the drugmaker provides the product at a lower wholesale cost. The rationale is that if a drug costs $10 to the customer out-of-pocket, instead of $100 out-of-pocket, people are more likely to fill the $10 prescription. Drugs with a lower co-pay also give drugmakers more access to the market, which allows them to sell more drugs. But if drugmakers go directly to consumers and offer to cover these relatively small co-pays, there is no incentive for the company to lower its price for insurers. That means wholesale drug prices are higher, thereby driving up the overall cost of healthcare when insurers pass these costs on to consumers in premiums and deductibles. For example, Kal\u00e9o provides coupons to make both Auvi-Q and Evzio free out of pocket using a program called \u201cAffordability\u201d, which requires patients to give their personal information in exchange for discounts. The company then covers patients\u2019 co-pays, undercutting the competition in out-of-pocket cost to consumers. \u201cWe are certainly concerned about the list price,\u201d said Tonya Winders, president and CEO of Allergy and Asthma Network, adding: \u201cOur greatest concern is really what this means for patients, and how they\u2019re paying out of pocket,\u201d she said. She added: \u201cI am concerned about what this means for the overall system. The greater question is \u2013 why do pharmaceutical companies feel the need to price these products in this structure? \u201cAnd what is the purpose of the list price being so high, if in fact on the back end they offer all of these rebates? It lacks transparency.\u201d",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The government argues its plan to cut company tax will drive investment and create jobs, but a new report by progressive think tank, the Australia Institute, questions that assumption. The report\u2019s authors argue that 15 of Australia\u2019s largest companies \u2013 which would receive around a third of the cost of the tax cuts \u2013 are unlikely to invest in areas that would drive either economic growth or employment. The government\u2019s case for why we need company tax cuts has always rather struggled to match rhetoric with evidence. The primary argument for why we need the tax cut is that because other nations have been cutting rates, we need to follow suit. The governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia, Phillip Lowe, alluded to this point in a speech last week when he noted that Australia needs \u201cto make sure that our tax system is internationally competitive. One example of this complication is in the area of corporate tax\u201d. And certainly our company tax rate is now among the highest in the OECD: But we need to be careful when comparing tax rates across nations. Scott Morrison, for example, last week tweeted a graphic suggesting that Australia\u2019s company tax rate was uncompetitive because, for example, Canada\u2019s company tax rate was 15%. But Morrison\u2019s tweet incorrectly failed to include the company tax levied by the Canadian provincial governments. The company tax rate in Canada that includes all company tax is really 26.8% \u2013 rather closer to Australia\u2019s 30% than our treasurer would have you believe. Australia, unlike most other nations, also has dividend imputation. This allows individual investors in Australia avoid taxation on their dividends \u2013 and means that just comparing company tax rates is rather misleading. And while it sounds like common sense, the reality is there is also not a great deal of evidence that cutting company tax drives economic growth. While Australia has kept tax rates steady, it has outperformed most other nations in the OECD. Of the 10 best performing economies since 2011, none had cut company tax rates, and only four had cut rates in the five years prior: But putting that to one side, if the main argument is that we need to cut rates because we\u2019ve fallen behind other nations, why then is the government waiting till 2025-26 to do it for all companies? The reason, of course, is the cost \u2013 estimated at $48.3bn over 10 years \u2013 and that is with the biggest cuts only happening in the last four years. The problem for the government is that the expected benefits from this expensive policy only kick in once big businesses (with annual turnovers of more than $1bn) receive the cut. But the first cut to such businesses is scheduled only to occur in 2022-23, and the final rate of 25% is only reached in 2026-27. The Treasury department\u2019s analysis of the long-term impact of the tax cuts found that the main benefits occur only after that point. And the benefits are tenuous at best. The treasurer may tweet that the tax cuts \u201cwill boost Australian wages and secure jobs\u201d, but his own department\u2019s analysis suggests the tax cut will lead to an increase in jobs after 2026-27 of just 0.1%. And while the analysis suggests the tax cuts would lead to a 1.1% long-term increase in wages, that increase is dependent upon improved labour productivity as a result of increased investment. However, a new paper by the Australia Institute argues that the tax cut will be unlikely to cause the largest businesses in Australia to generate such investment. The report, \u201cOligopoly Money\u201d, released on Tuesday, notes that the 15 of the largest Australian businesses, which stand to receive around a third of the benefit of the tax cut, operate within oligarchies \u2013 where a small number of companies dominate the market share. Companies within oligopolies are less inclined to invest in areas which will see them expand or increase employment, because a large driver of their profitability is the oligopoly itself. The report\u2019s authors argue that the key investments by these firms are most often about \u201cmaintaining the barriers to entry that give them extensive market power\u201d \u2013 ie, doing things that prevent new companies entering into the market. Think of the retail business, which is dominated by Woolworths and Wesfarmers. Investment by these two companies is mostly directed at gaining a strategic advantage over the other by property purchases \u2013 which can drive out smaller competition and establish dominance in a geographical area. The paper argues that when those companies do invest to improve productivity, largely it is aimed at reducing workforce, as anyone who has seen the proliferation of self-service checkouts can attest. Another sector dominated by a small number of players is the banking and insurance industry. The paper estimates that the big four banks, Macquarie Group and QBE Insurance would be the beneficiaries of around $3.7bn in tax cuts in 2026-27, and yet that sector, while very profitable, is an investment pauper. The paper found that while those six companies earn 9% of total company taxable income, they account for just 1.2% of all private investment. And again, such investment is generally not driven towards employment expansion, but instead on areas such as ATMs and internet banking \u2013 useful certainly for consumers, but hardly likely to lead to a boost to jobs or wages. The paper also notes that while the telecommunications industry would be expected to see great investment, the largest player, Telstra, invests almost as much in property, plant and equipment as it claims in depreciation in those same areas. As paper\u2019s authors archly note, \u201cif Telstra was a serious investor in innovation, there would be no need for NBN Co\u201d. And of course the biggest driver of investment over the past 15 years has been mining, and yet such investment is completely unlinked to our company tax rate, but rather \u201cis dependent on where minerals are and their price\u201d: The Australia Institute\u2019s paper notes that \u201cnone of the top 15 listed companies are likely to engage in significant additional investment or innovation despite getting a third of the proposed company tax cut when it is fully implemented\u201d. And yet such investment is the key foundation for a majority of the supposed benefits of the tax cuts. The government\u2019s tax cut policy suffers from two problems. First, if the cuts are so good and urgent, why are they waiting nearly 10 years until instituting them? And second, if the benefits for workers is to come from increased investment, where is the evidence that investment will occur given a third of the cost of tax cuts will go to businesses unlikely to increase investment in areas that will drive either jobs or growth?",

      "bodyText": "The chemicals group Ineos has insisted its plan to build an off-road vehicle to succeed the Land Rover Defender is not a vanity project driven by its billionaire founder and chairman Jim Ratcliffe. Ineos will set up a new division, Ineos Automotive, and expects to spend \u201cmany hundreds of millions\u201d on developing a 4x4 vehicle that could fill the gap in the market left by the Defender, which has been discontinued by Jaguar Land Rover. The company is focused on manufacturing and distributing chemicals, oil and gas, but Ratcliffe is a self-confessed admirer of the Defender. Ineos wants to sell the vehicle for less than \u00a350,000 and will aim it at farmers, foresters, explorers and enthusiasts. The company is looking to manufacture the off-roader in the UK \u2013 although it is also considering options in Europe \u2013 with the first cars potentially available from 2020. Ineos Automotive could employ up to 1,000 people if the venture is successful. Tom Crotty, a director at Ineos, said the company had conducted a six-month feasibility study into the project \u2013 which considered two major issues \u2013 before committing to building the vehicle. \u201cOne was if its possible to manufacture a traditional off-roader that meets global regulations, and we believe that answer to that is yes,\u201d he said. \u201cThen it was how feasible would it be to manufacture this vehicle from scratch at a cost that we could sell it to the target market. \u201cWe are clearly one of the biggest UK manufacturers. We believe the practices of good manufacturing apply whatever you are making, but we are not so arrogant that we think we have nothing to learn, so we are out hiring people from the industry. \u201cWe are committed to qualify for UK manufacturing. Jim has a real passion and belief that we [the UK] have lost a lot of the manufacturing bases. That is not a good thing long-term for any country. \u201cHe is very committed to that and sees this as another way to achieve that. It is not a vanity project. There must be a lot of people like this [who like the Defender] who can\u2019t buy the car anymore, so we think there is a market.\u201d However, industry analysts warned that Ineos faced stiff competition in the 4x4 market from Toyota, but also Jaguar Land Rover, which is repurposing old Defenders and intends to launch a new model in 2019. David Bailey, professor of industry at Aston University, said: \u201cThere may be a small niche market for certain uses and for fans of extreme off-road driving, but there is already quite a lot of competition. \u201cIt is not clear to me if the business case stacks up. I am sceptical as to whether it is viable, but having said that there are a lot of niche sports car companies in the UK at the moment. \u201cMaking cars is more difficult than people realise. You need to design the car, build the supply chain, build your brand, and then make the car itself and develop an assembly line.\u201d Ratcliffe was quoted in Ineos\u2019s announcement about the project saying that he was a \u201cgreat admirer of the old Land Rover Defender\u201d and has \u201cenormous respect for its off road capability\u201d. \u201cOur new 4 x4 has been inspired by it. But while our off-roader might share its spirit, our new car will be a major improvement on previous models,\u201d he said. In January 2016, the last Land Rover Defender rolled off the production line at Jaguar Land Rover\u2019s Solihull plant in the West Midlands. The Defender, which first appeared in the aftermath of the second world war, was originally conceived as a no-frills, off-road vehicle marketed as a \u201cgo anywhere\u201d option. The Defender name was introduced in 1990. More than 2m were built and its rugged design has ensured that an estimated two-thirds of Defenders and their predecessors are still on the road. After ceasing production of new Defenders, Jaguar Land Rover launched a heritage vehicle restoration line, repurposing old Defenders, at its Solihull plant.",

That is not a good thing long-term for any country.</p> <p>\u201cHe is very committed to that and sees this as another way to achieve that. It is not a vanity project. There must be a lot of people like this [who like the Defender] who can\u2019t buy the car anymore, so we think there is a market.\u201d</p> <p>However, industry analysts warned that Ineos faced stiff competition in the 4x4 market from Toyota, but also Jaguar Land Rover, which is repurposing old Defenders and intends to launch a new model in 2019.</p> <p>David Bailey, professor of industry at Aston University, said: \u201cThere may be a small niche market for certain uses and for fans of extreme off-road driving, but there is already quite a lot of competition.</p> <p>\u201cIt is not clear to me if the business case stacks up. I am sceptical as to whether it is viable, but having said that there are a lot of niche sports car companies in the UK at the moment.</p> <p>\u201cMaking cars is more difficult than people realise. You need to design the car, build the supply chain, build your brand, and then make the car itself and develop an assembly line.\u201d</p> <p>Ratcliffe was quoted in Ineos\u2019s announcement about the project saying that he was a \u201cgreat admirer of the old Land Rover Defender\u201d and has \u201cenormous respect for its off road capability\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cOur new 4 x4 has been inspired by it. But while our off-roader might share its spirit, our new car will be a major improvement on previous models,\u201d he said.</p> <p>In January 2016, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jan/29/last-land-rover-defender-rolls-off-production-line\">last Land Rover Defender rolled off the production line</a> at Jaguar Land Rover\u2019s Solihull plant in the West Midlands.<br></p> <p>The Defender, which first appeared in the aftermath of the second world war, was originally conceived as a no-frills, off-road vehicle marketed as a \u201cgo anywhere\u201d option.

      "bodyText": "The eurozone will enjoy stronger economy growth than previously thought this year and next but face risks from uncertainty surrounding Donald Trump\u2019s presidency and the UK\u2019s negotiations to leave the European Union, according to forecasts by the European commission. The executive arm of the EU became the latest body to concede its predictions made shortly after the Brexit vote had been overly gloomy. It also upgraded its outlook for the UK this year. After a stronger than expected close to 2016, it sees the UK economy growing 1.5% this year, compared with a forecast for just 1% growth made in November. That would still mark a significant slowdown from last year\u2019s 2% growth. The commission sees the UK economy losing further momentum in 2018, with growth of just 1.2%, unchanged from November\u2019s forecast. Its forecasts follow the move by the Bank of England this month to raise its outlook for the UK economy this year. It sees GDP expanding 2.0% in 2017 and 1.6% in 2018. The commission also pencilled in more upbeat prospects for the 19-state eurozone after a \u201cbetter-than-expected performance in the second half of 2016 and a rather robust start into 2017\u201d. It forecasts eurozone economic growth of 1.6% in 2017 and 1.8% in 2018, compared with 1.5% and 1.7%, respectively, in the previous set of forecasts three months ago. The new forecast means the commission still expects growth in the eurozone to slow this year, from 1.7% in 2016. It said private consumption remained the \u201cengine of the recovery\u201d and that while investment growth continued it was still subdued. It was also keen to stress downside risks to its forecast. \u201cThe particularly high uncertainty surrounding this winter forecast is due to the still-to-be-clarified intentions of the new administration of the United States in key policy areas, as well as the numerous elections to be held in Europe this year and the upcoming article 50 negotiations with the UK,\u201d it said in the outlook. The Brussels-based commission joined other forecasters in suggesting there could be a short-term boost to growth from Trump\u2019s plans to cut US taxes and increase state spending. In the medium term, however, it saw risks to growth in Europe from the Brexit vote, disruptions to trade, faster-than-expected interest rate rises in the US and the potential consequences of high debt in China. But it also saw reasons to be positive about the state of the EU economy as it faced those potential challenges. For the first time in almost a decade, the economies of all EU member states were expected to grow throughout the forecasting period of 2016, 2017 and 2018. The commission\u2019s outlook for the jobs market was also mildly positive. Eurozone unemployment was expected to drop from 10.0% in 2016 to 9.6% this year and 9.1% in 2018. The commission forecast eurozone inflation would increase from 0.2% in 2016 to 1.7% in 2017 and then ease back to 1.4% in 2018. The European commission vice-president said the return of inflation should be taken by policymakers as a sign the European Central Bank could not keep interest rates ultra-low and continue to print electronic money indefinitely. \u201cWith inflation picking up from low levels, we cannot expect current monetary stimulus to last forever. Therefore countries with high deficit and debt levels should continue bringing them down to become more resilient to economic shocks,\u201d Valdis Dombrovskis said.",

      "bodyText": "Signs of a \u201cmore emollient tone\u201d from Donald Trump towards Japan and China, along with news that the European commission had raised its growth forecasts for the eurozone and UK economies, combined to send global stock markets to new peaks on Monday. In the US the Dow Jones industrial average, the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq composite, which had already been boosted in recent days by Trump\u2019s promise of a \u201cphenomenal\u201d tax reform announcement in the next few weeks, all hit record highs following the president\u2019s meeting with the Japanese prime minister, Shinzo Abe, over the weekend. The S&amp;P 500 is now valued at a record $20trn. The Dow closed at a record level of 20,412 having passed 20,000 for the first time last last month. Apple, the world\u2019s most valuable company, also hit a new high of $133.29, surpassing a record set in February 2015, as investors bet on strong sales of the 10th-anniversary iPhone, expected later this year. During the visit, Trump affirmed Washington\u2019s \u201cone China\u201d policy. Abe and Trump also agreed to discuss a bilateral trade deal to fill the void created by the US withdrawal from the Trans-Pacific Partnership agreement. Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK, said: \u201cThe initial belligerence of the Trump administration towards China and Japan appears to have given way to a more practicable way of doing things, and while peace may not have broken out quite yet, some welcome pragmatism does appear to be taking hold in Washington. \u201cWhile it\u2019s too early to suppose that President Trump\u2019s attitude won\u2019t change, given his unpredictability, the more emollient tone does appear to be pacifying markets for now.\u201d Analysts also pointed to another reason for the strength in US markets. Jasper Lawler, senior market analyst at London Capital Group, said: \u201cInvestors are pricing in the benefits of a Goldman Sachs-led treasury department. Steve Mnuchin [who spent 17 years at the investment bank] is in the final hours of his confirmation as treasury secretary ... Donald Trump\u2019s agenda of financial deregulation will likely have another supporter in the form of Mnuchin.\u201d Meanwhile the European commission\u2019s raised forecasts for Europe\u2019s economies helped to push German and French stock markets sharply higher despite the continuing concerns about forthcoming elections in both countries, as well as the renewed uncertainty over the Greek bailout programme. Germany\u2019s Dax ended 0.9% higher while France\u2019s Cac climbed 1.2%. The Stoxx 600, an index of stocks from 17 European countries, added 0.85%, reaching its highest level since December 2015. But with the pound holding firm ahead of inflation figures on Tuesday, UK markets underperformed their rivals. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said: \u201cAnalysts are expecting [the inflation figure to be] near the Bank of England\u2019s targeted 2%. The prospect of such an upward CPI [consumer price index] swing, and the potential ramifications this has for a Bank of England rate hike, has helped the pound hold off the dollar while nabbing nearly half a percent in growth from the euro.\u201d The FTSE 100 \u2013 which is dominated by overseas earners and thus benefits from weaker sterling \u2013 closed up 0.28% at 7,278. The more domestically focused FTSE 250 finished up 0.23% at 18,758, its fifth day of record closes. The index has been supported by signs that the UK economy has so far avoided the worst predictions made ahead of the Brexit vote. Elsewhere, mining shares were among the biggest gainers as metal prices moved higher, partly on the expected benefits of Trump\u2019s promised infrastructure spending plans and partly on recent positive figures from the Chinese economy, including a better than expected 7.9% growth in exports. On top of that copper hit its highest level in nearly two years as a strike at BHP Billiton\u2019s Escondida mine in Chile \u2013 one of the two biggest in the world \u2013 continued.",

      "bodyText": "The return of the Trump trade - the boost to markets following the US presidential election - and upbeat economic forecasts from the European Commission combined to lift share prices on the first trading day of a busy week. Trump\u2019s positive meeting with Japanese prime minister Shinzo Abe over the weekend sent Asian markets higher, and the upbeat mood continued elsewhere. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished up 20.17 points or 0.28% at 7278.92 Germany\u2019s Dax rose 0.92% to 11,774.43 France\u2019s Cac climbed 1.24% to 4888.19 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB was 1.07% higher at 19,064.64 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended up 1.13% at 9484.1 In Greece, the Athens market added 0.86% to 629.14 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 0.65% at 20,402, close to the all time high of 20.404 touched earlier. On that note it\u2019s time to close for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. Back with Greece, and Fitch has said its current CCC junk credit rating depends on the country\u2019s creditors open the door to further funding before July. The agency said: \u201cOur sovereign credit assessment is underpinned by our assumption that the second review of Greece\u2019s third bailout programme will be completed well ahead of July, maintaining access to official funding.\u201d But despite signs of compromise, there are still disagreements among the country\u2019s creditors. The IMF is reluctant to take part in a further bailout without further debt relief, but this is opposed by Greece\u2019s European creditors. Fitch said: \u201cRecent events highlight that political risk remains a sovereign rating weakness for Greece, despite positive economic and fiscal developments.\u201d The agency pointed out that Greece faced payments of more than \u20ac6bn in July, including \u20ac3.9bn to the European Central Bank. But it said: \u201cGreece has broadly met programme conditions and recorded a primary surplus of \u20ac4.4bn in 2016 thanks to higher-than-budgeted revenues. GDP rose 1.8% year on year in the third quarter of 2016, the largest annual increase in over eight years. This progress is one reason that we think Greece\u2019s European creditors would be prepared to proceed with the second review and to disburse funds without IMF involvement. Another reason is their desire to avoid a Greek political crisis during an already congested election year in Europe. \u201cCompleting the second programme review and disbursing the associated ESM funds would enable Greece to meet its July maturities... Doing so in a timely fashion and avoiding the level of brinksmanship of the first half of 2015 would reduce the risk that Greece\u2019s economic recovery is undermined by a hit to confidence or by the Greek government building up arrears to conserve liquidity.\u201d Fitch is due to review Greece\u2019s CCC rating on 24 February. Jasper Lawler, senior market analyst at London Capital Group, pointed to another possible reason for the continuing strength of the US market: Investors are pricing in the benefits of a Goldman Sachs-led Treasury Department. Steve Mnuchin [who spent 17 years at the investment bank] is in the final hours of his confirmation as Treasury secretary. He is expected to be confirmed around 7pm EST Monday. Donald Trump\u2019s agenda of financial deregulation will likely have another supporter in the form Mnuchin. Mnuchin and Gary Cohn will be a more \u2018internationalist\u2019 influence on Trump, potentially putting a lid the President\u2019s penchant for currency wars and trade tariffs. The benefit to Wall Street of having an ex-Goldman Sachs banker as Treasury Secretary is pretty self-evident. In extension, it would make sense for Mnuchin to fill key positions at the treasury with his people, namely other Wall Streeters. Senior Goldman Sachs banker Jim Donovan as well as Justin Muzinich, a former Morgan Stanley worker are reportedly being considered for key positions. As expected, Wall Street has opened higher, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average, the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite all hitting new peaks. The raised growth forecasts from the European Union have helped sentiment, but it is the return of the Trump bounce following a lull which is pushing markets higher again. The president\u2019s positive meeting with Japanese prime minister Shinzo Abe has helped the upbeat mood, while mining shares are benefiting from the prospect of Trump\u2019s infrastructure plans as well as capacity concerns after a strike at a BHP Billiton copper mine in Chile. The Dow is currently up 91 points at 20,360 having earlier touched 20,364, while the S&amp;P opened 0.24% higher and the Nasdaq 0.3%. In a sign that Northern Ireland\u2019s economy is still fragile, and local spending power lower than the rest of the UK, a new survey has found that one out of every seven shops on the region\u2019s high streets lies empty. The report for the Northern Ireland Retail Consortium has noted that the shop vacancy rate is now at its lowest since 2011 in the depth of the recession.But the rate of empty premises has only fallen by 0.5 per cent in the last three months. Overall the vacancy rate in terms of shops in Northern Ireland - 14 per cent - remains the highest of any area of the UK. Aodhan Connolly, director of the Northern Ireland Consortium, while accentuating the positive from the slight call in shop vacancy rates, also issued a warning about Brexit\u2019s impact on local consumers. Connolly said that once a new power sharing executive is formed after the Assembly elections on 2 March, the next regional government must \u201cput the consumer first during the Brexit negotiations.\u201d He said that with Northern Irish households having only half the spending power of their counterparts in Britain the next devolved government must \u201cmake the case for tariff free trade\u201d in order to continue \u201ckeeping show prices low once the UK leaves the European Union.\u201d Greece\u2019s central bank chief has now weighed in, warning MPs that the Greek bailout talks must be concluded quickly, before the economy is hurt by the uncertainty. Yannis Stournaras told the Athens parliament\u2019s economic affairs committee that time was running out, so both sides should make concessions to get a deal done. Stournaras (who was finance minister in an earlier phase of the Greek crisis), said: \u201cBailout review talks are at a very critical phase. The economy\u2019s positive momentum must be assured by the swift conclusion of the review. \u201cConditions could be much worse later, it may be too late.\u201d This uncertainty is hitting Greek bonds today, pushing the yield (or interest rate) on two-year debt back over 9% - a dangerously high level. Traders are worried that Greece won\u2019t receive its next tranche of bailout aid by the summer, when it must repay \u20ac7bn to its lenders. Back to Greece.... where senior officials are warning that there are \u201cred lines\u201d that cannot be overstepped to conclude the compliance review at the heart of Greece\u2019s standoff with its creditors. In a strongly-worded interview this morning the interior minister, Panos Skourletis, insisted that the leftist-led government would not put its signature to an agreement that would doom Greece to a permanent debt deflationary cycle. Warning that the European Union \u201cmight not exist in a few years\u201d Skourletis told the leftist Syntaktwn newspaper: \u201cAn agreement that prolongs this state of uncertainty, that impedes growth and recycles recession cannot be accepted \u2026 no one can be sure if the European Union will exist in a few years.\u201d Growing opposition to fresh austerity measures from the ruling Syriza\u2019s party base dominated a meeting of Syriza\u2019s executive committee at the weekend. Under pressure to step up resistance to calls for further pension cuts and tax increases, prime minister Alexis Tsipras used the opportunity to urge German chancellor Angela Merkel to rein in her finance minister Wolfgang Schauble accusing him of plotting to create a two-speed euro zone. Speaking to the Guardian, the Syriza MP Hara Karafanti said Greece was paying the price of the ongoing spat between the IMF and EU over how to deal with the country. She also believes that Fund\u2019s demands for fresh cuts are based on a false and outdated assessment of the Greek economy. Karafanti said: \u201cThe demand for more measures is a result of the confusion that currently prevails between the creditor institutions.... The US stock market is expected to post further gains when trading begins in almost two hours time. That would add to Friday\u2019s record close, and extend the rally that began with Trump\u2019s shock win three months ago. European stock markets have now hit their highest levels in 14 months. Today\u2019s EC forecasts and the re-emergence of the \u2018Trump trade\u2019 have pushed the Stoxx 600 index to its highest level since December 2015. Mining shares are still showing solid gains, helped by predictions that the US government\u2019s promise of tax reforms will spur growth. Consumer goods firms, tech companies and industrial corporations are also leading the risers. Relief that Trump and Abe\u2019s summit appears to have gone well are also pushing shares higher. But the optimism feels shaky, and could unravel if Trump doesn\u2019t deliver on his tax pledges. Mihir Kapadia, CEO of Sun Global Investments, explains: \u201cIt\u2019s been a relatively incident-free end to the week at the White House and thus the markets are starting off the Monday on a positive note further to the bilateral discussions between the heads of states of the US and Japan. While the US dollar has strengthened against the Yen over the backdrop of a cordial visit from Prime Minister Abe of Japan, the markets are cautious on what is oncoming within the next few weeks as president Trump promised to announce something \u201cphenomenal\u201d on the tax front. This is likely to be on Tax reforms and infrastructure spending, but considering he needs approval from Congress, the feasibility of fruition is still being questioned. If for instance the infrastructure spending aren\u2019t approved, we may see a disappointed market bringing down the US dollar which continues to be strong despite the bumps and controversies caused by the Trump presidency.\u201d During questions on today\u2019s forecasts, Pierre Moscovici warned that the European project would be imperilled if Marine Le Pen wins the French presidency: The key takeaway from today\u2019s European growth forecasts is that every member of the EU is expected to grow steadily from 2016 to 2018. That hasn\u2019t happened since the financial crisis almost a decade ago. Despite the deadlock over Greece\u2019s bailout, the EC insists that the country\u2019s economy is on the right track. Today\u2019s economic forecasts predict that Greek GDP will jump by 2.7%, up from a mere 0.3% last year, and then hit 3.1% growth in 2018. Speaking in Brussels, commissioner Pierre Moscovici says he will travel to Athens on Wednesday, to help conclude the current negotiations with its creditors - and hopefully unlock the next aid tranche. Remember: both sides are hoping for a breakthrough in time for the next meeting of eurozone finance ministers, on 20 February. Today\u2019s EC forecasts also predict that France\u2019s budget deficit will drop below the official target of 3% of GDP this year, only to swell over it again in 2018. That suggests it will be hard for the next president to boost government borrowing, without sparking a row with Brussels (although if Marine Le Pen wins, and pulls France out of the euro, these targets won\u2019t apply anyway). The EC also predicts that Britain\u2019s inflation rate will hit 2.5% this year, as the weak pound pushes up the cost of living. The EC has also admitted that the Brexit vote has had less impact than previously thought. It is now less gloomy about growth this year -- raising its forecast from 1% to 1.5% in 2017 (before slowing to 1.2% in 2018). Today\u2019s forecasts says: \u201cThe impact of the vote by the U.K. to leave the EU in the referendum held on 23 June 2016 on growth has yet to be felt.... Recent momentum is projected to largely continue in the first quarter...[but] ease notably thereafter.\u201d Newsflash: The European Commission has upped its growth forecasts for the eurozone over the next two years. In its new Winter Forecasts, the EC now predicts eurozone GDP will rise by 1.6% this year, up from 1.5% previously. It also expects growth to accelerate to 1.8% in 2018, up from 1.7%. The EC also expects unemployment to keep falling from its current high levels. It expects the jobless rate to average 9.6% this year, down from 10% last year, and then fall to 9.1% in 2018. Here\u2019s a video clip of the forecasts: Martin Schulz, Germany\u2019s Social Democratic Party\u2019s candidate for chancellor, has given politicians in Greece food for thought - and some glee \u2013 this morning by warning that talk of a Greek exit from the EU may suit the likes of president Trump but will only endanger Europe. Speaking to Die Welt the chancellor candidate said: \u201cAnyone flirting with the idea of Grexit risks breaking Europe apart. This may be in the interest of [US president] Donald Trump or [French National Front leader] Marine Le Pen, but it is certainly not in the interest of Germany and Europe. It is extremely dangerous.\u201d Across the board, MPs are interpreting Schulz\u2019s statements as strong rebuke of Berlin\u2019s finance minister Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble who has repeatedly suggested it would be better for Greece to leave the common currency. Hara Kafantari, who represents the governing Syriza party in parliament told the Guardian: \u201cIt is a very strong message to Sch\u00e4uble that his [yearning] for Grexit could lead to the dismemberment of Europe. It\u2019s also a message to the euro zone that it should sit and think seriously about which way it wants to go because policies right now are like shifting sands, no one knows what is going to happen from one day to the next. Europe has to decide whether it is going to move to the far right or return to the principles of democracy.\u201d Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble has long been seen by Athens to play bad cop to chancellor Angela Merkel\u2019s good cop. On Friday the former finance minister Yanis Varoufakis told this business blog: \u201cGrexit is a football being kicked around between Dr Sch\u00e4uble and Mrs Merkel. Sch\u00e4uble is determined to kick Greece out and Merkel is determined not to make a decision until she really must.\u201d The US dollar has hit a two-week high against the Japanese yen this morning. One dollar was trading at \u00a5114.1 yen at one point, up from \u00a5113.1 on Friday night, partly thanks to relief that the Trump-Abe summit passed off without incident. As Kit Juckes of Societe Generale puts it.. President Trump played golf with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, with bonhomie replacing currency wars. That set the stage for a risk-friendly start to the week, with USD/JPY tracking higher and equities in a buoyant mood across Asia. But Juckes is also concerned that investors are putting too much faith in Trump\u2019s promise of a major tax cut programme soon. So if the president doesn\u2019t deliver, there could be plenty of disappointment... The more dollar-positive and risk-friendly mood is rooted in the terrifying flakey earth of President Trump\u2019s promise last week that he will announce something phenomenal on tax policy in the next two to three weeks. With soundbites coming so far ahead of details, markets are unable to avoid over-excitement but of course they (we) are vulnerable to disappointment if the detail doesn\u2019t live up to the expectations that grow so easily. In turn, that means market confidence is pretty fragile, too. Here\u2019s another sign that investors are in a confident mood: Zing! Britain\u2019s FTSE 250 index has hit another all-time high. The index, which contains medium-sized companies too small for the FTSE 100, is up 0.2% this morning at 18,748 points. Some UK news - the troubled Co-operative Bank is up for sale, four years after being rescued by a group of hedge funds. Mining firms are leading the charge this morning, as traders bet that robust economic growth will keep commodity prices higher. Glencore, Anglo American, BHP Billiton and Rio Tinto are all up over 2%. This has pushed London\u2019s FTSE 100 higher, and the mining sector to its highest since August 2014. Fears of a copper shortage are partly to blame, with workers at a BHP Billiton mine in Chile currently on strike. Kathleen Brooks of City Index says the markets are looking for Donald Trump to deliver on his campaign pledges this month. Trump is, without doubt, a key theme of 2017, however, in the past week I have noticed a few changes in the way he is impacting financial markets. Firstly, the tweeter-in-chief might be losing some of his potency. The markets are starting to get used to his Twitter outbursts, and even after retailer Nordstrom was singled out for his ire last week, its shares actually rose after it received the \u2018Trump treatment\u2019. Secondly, the markets are now focused on 28th February, when Trump will give his first State of the Union address to Congress and is expected to lay out his taxation and infrastructure plans. Big things are expected, infrastructure spending could the be the hardest to get past Congress, so if Trump rolls back on some of his spending rhetoric to try and win the support of Congress then the financial markets may not be so impressed. James Bevan of charity fund manager CCLA agrees that the Trump-Abe summit will have pleased investors: But Henry Croft of Accendo Markets sees geopolitical worries building: US equities continue to rally in expectation of Donald Trump\u2019s tax reform and a successful two-day Japan-US summit in Washington. This optimism, however, is being offset by rising geopolitical concerns following North Korea\u2019s successful missile test on Sunday whilst a weaker Dollar in Asian trading weighs on the foreign earnings heavy FTSE 100. Global stock markets are rallying at the start of the week, driven by optimism that US president Donald Trump\u2019s tax cutting plans will boost global growth. Relief that Trump\u2019s meeting with Japanese prime minister Shinzo Abe passed off pretty well over the weekend has also helped to push share prices higher in Asia. Japan\u2019s Nikkei has closed up 0.4% at a two-week high, while other Asian markets have hit their highest level in 18 months, as Reuters explains: MSCI\u2019s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan gained 0.3 percent, with resource-related stocks in Australia leading the gains. Markets in Taiwan and Singapore scaled their highest levels since mid-2015. These gains follow a record close on Wall Street on Friday night. Last week, Trump cheered investors by promising to announce a \u201cphenomenal\u201d tax reform proposal within a few weeks - a challenging goal, but one that has cheered investors. The Trump-Abe meeting has also gone better than many observers feared -- despite the Japanese PM finding himself on the wrong end of one of the president\u2019s infamous handshakes: During the visit, Trump ticked some important diplomatic boxes by affirming Washington\u2019s \u201cone China\u201d policy, and avoiding labelling Beijing a currency manipulator. Abe and Trump also agreed to discuss a bilateral trade deal - to fill the void created by America\u2019s withdrawal from the Trans-Pacific Partnership agreement. North Korea cast a shadow over the event, of course, by testing a ballistic missile over the weekend. But that prompted Japan and the US to reaffirm their own ties.... Analysts reckon the meeting went pretty well. Here\u2019s AP\u2019s take: \u201cThis positive lead from the U.S. coupled with improving trade sentiment provides the backing for a positive Monday for Asian markets,\u201d Jingyi Pan of IG said in a report. The Trump-Abe meeting and Trump\u2019s \u201cOne China\u201d commitment \u201ccould allay some of the trade concerns in Asia and set free into the market more bullish bets,\u201d said Pan. \u201cWhile it remains to be hashed out, President Donald Trump\u2019s mention of a \u2018level playing field\u2019 on currency valuation also appears to reflect an amicable turn after the U.S. president accused his visitors of currency manipulation.\u201d Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. It feels like a cautious start to the week, with not much in the economic calendar. At 10am GMT, the European Commission issues its latest economic forecasts for the region. It may revise its growth forecasts upwards, as Britain\u2019s Brexit vote and Donald Trump\u2019s election victory haven\u2019t derailed Europe\u2019s slow recovery. Germany, meanwhile, has just released new wholesale inflation data, showing that prices jumped by 4% in the last year. That\u2019s going to fuel concerns that inflation is accelerating too rapidly for Berlin\u2019s comfort. Investors will also be watching events in Greece. Officials from its creditors are due back in Athens next week, in the hope of reaching a deal on its next bailout payment before February 20th. EC vice-president Valdis Dombrovskis has called on all parties to finalise an agreement quickly, warning yesterday that: \u201cNow is not the time to turn the clocks back to financial instability,\u201d But Greek PM Alexis Tsipras insists that Athens will not cave in, declaring that: \u201cWe will not agree to demands that are not backed up by logic and numbers.\u201d So it could be a nervy week....",

      "bodyText": "Co-op Bank, now that it has announced its sale, is going the way of the Bradford &amp; Bingley \u2013 to be broken up, run off and the name consigned to history. The good bits \u2013 its 1.4 million current account holders, and a now half-decent mortgage book \u2013 have value. The bad bits \u2013 the remaining toxic loans (much of them acquired from the disastrous merger with Britannia building society) \u2013 will have to be run off. But make no bones about what is happening here. The Co-op Bank as an independent, ethically based challenger to the major banks is dead. The co-operative title, in any case a misnomer under hedge fund ownership, must surely die once Co-operative Group abandons its remaining 20% parcel of shares. Its already much slimmed-down branch network will (bar perhaps a bid from Virgin Money) close its doors. And its fabled ethical policy? Expect to hear much noise (to keep hold of customers) but little in the way of substance from whoever buys it. In some ways it is a miracle that Co-op Bank survived after the \u00a31.5bn black hole was discovered in 2013, irrespective of the antics of its \u201ccrystal methodist\u201d chairman exposed in the tabloids. Never forget that it was not bailed out by taxpayers like its bigger brothers. It has slashed its way back to a semblance of profitability, if one examines its underlying on-going operations (the \u201ccore bank\u201d made a profit of \u00a317m in the first half of 2016) and it now gets by with a total of only 4,000 staff and 105 branches. It has, remarkably, even won new customers, and its mortgage book is mostly on LTVs (loan-to-value ratios) of 60-65%, which is a comfortable cushion of equity. But the continued low-interest-rate environment is a painful cap on its ability to generate income. Co-op is a bank that has a fundamentally weak capital base, and few obvious ways to rebuild it organically. In the new world of app and online banking, where customers rarely visit branches, Co-op just can\u2019t be an independent \u201cchallenger\u201d either to its big ugly sisters in banking, or the nimble upstarts. That\u2019s why a takeover is inevitable. If you apply the Martin Lewis test to its products, there is little to captivate you. To be fair, there\u2019s little to deter you either \u2013 what you find is a bank whose product line is boringly average. On moneysavingexpert.com\u2019s best bank accounts list, you\u2019ll see Nationwide, TSB, HSBC, First Direct, Santander and NatWest but no Co-op. It only gets a look-in for \u201cbest for ethical\u201d and even then Nationwide ranks alongside. TSB and Virgin Money look the most likely buyers, and if they have any sense they will seek to maintain some sort of ethical stance to retain the customer base. Meanwhile, the proposed sale leaves Nationwide as the only true challenger bank to the stockmarket-based banks we rescued from the mess of the 2007-08 global financial crisis. Champagne prices lose fizz Champagne, according to the Wine and Spirit Trade Association, is about to jump in price, a victim of Brexit and UK duties. But is that true? Pop into Lidl and you can find champagne for \u00a37.99 a bottle, while in Asda, Aldi and Tesco it\u2019s \u00a39.99. Maybe what we are really seeing is a crack in the extraordinary price premium that vineyards in an area of north-eastern France have historically charged for their output. Wine snobs will sneer at the cheap supermarket fizz. But to carry the protected champagne name it has to be from the region, and made using traditional methods. Which? named Aldi\u2019s \u00a310 Veuve Monsigny as one of its best buys, coming ahead of Laurent-Perrier and Moet &amp; Chandon in blind tasting. A hectare of land in the champagne region will change hands for more than \u20ac1m, compared with about \u20ac140,000 for a standard French-protected \u201cappellation\u201d. It is one reason why champagne is so pricey. Whether it\u2019s a good buy is another matter: a fraction of that price will buy land in Britain with similar soil characteristics producing sparkling wine sometimes to a better quality. Prosecco long overtook champagne by volume (it outsells by four bottles to one) and by total sales in Britain. There is some talk of \u201cprosecco fatigue\u201d, although Lidl disagrees, saying it sold 79% more in January 2017 compared with January 2016. And if prosecco\u2019s sweet charms fade in the British palette, Spanish cava is the likely alternative. Whisper it, even lambrusco is making a comeback, returning to the menu at Carluccio\u2019s for the first time in a decade. This is a problem for champagne. Half of the roughly 300m bottles of champagne produced a year are quaffed by the French, but after that the biggest market is the Brits, drinking about 35m-40m bottles. The reason champagne has sold for such a premium is not so much quality but branding. Ask the general public for a specific cava or prosecco brand name and they will struggle to name one \u2013 not least because the major supermarkets own-brand much of what they sell. But with Mo\u00ebt, Veuve, Tattinger, Krug and others, the French have superbly branded their output and priced it accordingly. Will this branding predominance survive? English producers are snapping away; Chapel Down sponsors the Oxford/Cambridge boat race, while Bolney has Wimbledon. Camel Valley and Nyetimber will no doubt enjoy a good Valentine\u2019s Day, and it can\u2019t be long before the Spanish sharpen their game. The French may talk about pushing up champagne prices, but whether they achieve it will be another matter.",

    "webTitle": "\u00a31.74 an hour: Jinn couriers complain over low earnings", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Some takeaway delivery couriers say they are being paid as little as \u00a31.74 an hour, far below the national minimum wage. A courier in Leeds self-employed through Jinn, an app that allows customers to have meals and groceries delivered to their homes from outlets such as McDonalds, KFC and Sainsbury\u2019s, provided evidence to the Guardian that he had been paid just \u00a3125 for 72 hours\u2019 work. Another showed he had received \u00a3264 for 94 hours \u2013 the equivalent of \u00a32.80 an hour. A third said he was paid an effective rate of \u00a33.05 an hour. Take-home pay is often even lower because the couriers must cover their own motorbike expenses of about \u00a330 a week. The national living wage for people aged 25 and over is currently \u00a37.20 an hour. In common with many workers in the UK\u2019s fast-growing gig economy, the couriers are classed as self-employed, meaning the mandatory minimum wage does not apply to them. But they have complained after Jinn, which is based in east London, scrapped a minimum hourly rate of \u00a38 an hour in January. They now work on a piecework basis, being paid per delivery rather than an hourly rate. Jinn reportedly secured a $7.5m (\u00a36m) investment last year, partly to expand its service to cities outside London. Jinn promises its customers: \u201cWe can get you anything you desire, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week \u2026 as long as it\u2019s legal.\u201d Couriers wait on bicycles or mopeds for orders that come through on their phones and can range from collecting a full meal for 10 from a branch of Nando\u2019s to picking up a couple of chocolate bars from Sainsbury\u2019s for a customer who would rather not leave their sofa. One Jinn courier Riz Ali, 33, said he had fallen into debt as a result of the fall in earnings. He had expected to earn \u00a3759.60 for two weeks\u2019 work in Leeds, but when Jinn removed the minimum hourly payment he was paid just \u00a3264. \u201cI lost \u00a3495 \u2013 that\u2019s my rent, which is about to fall due,\u201d he said. \u201cI am using my overdraft and will have to ask friends and family to help. It is absolutely terrible. You would get more on government benefits. It is not worth working.\u201d Another courier, speaking on condition of anonymity, said he had expected to earn almost \u00a3600 for the last two weeks but received only \u00a3125 for working more than 70 hours. \u201cThe money lasts just three or four days when I need it for two weeks,\u201d he said. \u201cI am also having to pay for a pushbike which I bought [to do the job] and that costs me \u00a3100 a month. I am having to rely on this job because it is hard to find anything else. It is better than going on the dole, which I have never been on in my life.\u201d Asked about the complaints of low pay, Jinn\u2019s co-founder and chief operating officer, Leon Herrera, said couriers were free to take or refuse work and were not exclusively contracted to Jinn. \u201cJinn is a delivery marketplace that aggregates demand and supply for collection and delivery services,\u201d he said. \u201cCouriers on our platform are 100% free to log in at their own schedule, accept or reject proposed drops, and do all of this on a completely non-exclusive basis.\u201d He said Jinn shared with couriers \u201cspaciotemporal data\u201d about when and where there was demand \u201cso that they can make informed decisions regarding log-in days, times and locations.\u201d Jinn is one of several \u201cgig economy\u201d companies to have been criticised by workers for low pay. A Guardian investigation into Hermes, whose 10,000 \u201clifestyle couriers\u201d deliver parcels for retailers including Next and John Lewis, found workers earning less than \u00a36 an hour. Minicab drivers on the Uber platform have repeatedly complained that their earnings fall below the minimum wage once Uber\u2019s 20% cut and car expenses are deducted. Both companies argue that they operate a self-employed model that allows contractors flexibility and excludes them from minimum wage obligations. Last month angry Jinn couriers in London surrounded Herrera outside the company\u2019s head office. In a video of the incident posted online, about 20 couriers can be seen circling the Spanish entrepreneur, demanding: \u201cWe want our money now.\u201d One said: \u201cWe stay out in the cold and work hard. You make so much money because of your drivers.\u201d The confrontation appeared to have been triggered by the removal of the guaranteed hourly rate. Adeel Nazim, 30, who worked 95 hours for \u00a3291 in Leeds, told the Guardian: \u201cIt is not worth being out for the money they are paying. We are sat in the freezing cold, sometimes waiting for two or three hours for a job. If this is the way they are going to treat us, it is really not on.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>Some takeaway delivery couriers say they are being paid as little as \u00a31.74 an hour, far below the national minimum wage.</p> <p>A courier in Leeds self-employed through Jinn, an app that allows customers to have meals and groceries delivered to their homes from outlets such as McDonalds, KFC and Sainsbury\u2019s, provided evidence to the Guardian that he had been paid just \u00a3125 for 72 hours\u2019 work.</p> <p>Another showed he had received \u00a3264 for 94 hours \u2013 the equivalent of \u00a32.80 an hour. A third said he was paid an effective rate of \u00a33.05 an hour. Take-home pay is often even lower because the couriers must cover their own motorbike expenses of about \u00a330 a week. The national living wage for people aged 25 and over is currently \u00a37.20 an hour.</p> <p>In common with many workers in the UK\u2019s fast-growing gig economy, the couriers are classed as self-employed, meaning the mandatory minimum wage does not apply to them. But they have complained after Jinn, which is based in east London, scrapped a minimum hourly rate of \u00a38 an hour in January. They now work on a piecework basis, being paid per delivery rather than an hourly rate.</p> <p>Jinn <a href=\"https://www.startupdelta.org/startups/25795\">reportedly secured a $7.5m (\u00a36m) investment</a> last year, partly to expand its service to cities outside London. <a href=\"https://blog.jinnapp.com/2016/05/24/as-long-as-its-legal/\">Jinn promises</a> its customers: \u201cWe can get you anything you desire, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week \u2026 as long as it\u2019s legal.\u201d</p> <p>Couriers wait on bicycles or mopeds for orders that come through on their phones and can range from collecting a full meal for 10 from a branch of Nando\u2019s to picking up a couple of chocolate bars from Sainsbury\u2019s for a customer who would rather not leave their sofa.</p> <p>One Jinn courier Riz Ali, 33, said he had fallen into debt as a result of the fall in earnings. He had expected to earn \u00a3759.60 for two weeks\u2019 work in Leeds, but when Jinn removed the minimum hourly payment he was paid just \u00a3264.</p> <p>\u201cI lost \u00a3495 \u2013 that\u2019s my rent, which is about to fall due,\u201d he said. \u201cI am using my overdraft and will have to ask friends and family to help. It is absolutely terrible. You would get more on government benefits. It is not worth working.\u201d</p> <p>Another courier, speaking on condition of anonymity, said he had expected to earn almost \u00a3600 for the last two weeks but received only \u00a3125 for working more than 70 hours.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>\u201cThe money lasts just three or four days when I need it for two weeks,\u201d he said. \u201cI am also having to pay for a pushbike which I bought [to do the job] and that costs me \u00a3100 a month. I am having to rely on this job because it is hard to find anything else. It is better than going on the dole, which I have never been on in my life.\u201d</p> <p>Asked about the complaints of low pay, Jinn\u2019s co-founder and chief operating officer, Leon Herrera, said couriers were free to take or refuse work and were not exclusively contracted to Jinn.</p> <p>\u201cJinn is a delivery marketplace that aggregates demand and supply for collection and delivery services,\u201d he said. \u201cCouriers on our platform are 100% free to log in at their own schedule, accept or reject proposed drops, and do all of this on a completely non-exclusive basis.\u201d</p> <p>He said Jinn shared with couriers \u201cspaciotemporal data\u201d about when and where there was demand \u201cso that they can make informed decisions regarding log-in days, times and locations.\u201d</p> <p>Jinn is one of several \u201cgig economy\u201d companies to have been criticised by workers for low pay. A <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/jan/26/hermes-facing-legal-challenge-from-its-self-employed-workers\">Guardian investigation into Hermes</a>, whose 10,000 \u201clifestyle couriers\u201d deliver parcels for retailers including Next and John Lewis, found workers earning less than \u00a36 an hour. Minicab drivers on the Uber platform have <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/nov/22/uber-drivers-go-slow-protest-central-london-minimum-wage-guarantee\">repeatedly complained</a> that their earnings fall below the minimum wage once Uber\u2019s 20% cut and car expenses are deducted. Both companies argue that they operate a self-employed model that allows contractors flexibility and excludes them from minimum wage obligations.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/help/2016/sep/19/how-to-contact-the-guardian-securely\">How to contact the Guardian securely</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Last month angry Jinn couriers in London surrounded Herrera outside the company\u2019s head office. In <a href=\"https://www.theregister.co.uk/2017/01/24/jinn_pay_protest/\">a video of the incident</a> posted online, about 20 couriers can be seen circling the Spanish entrepreneur, demanding: \u201cWe want our money now.\u201d One said: \u201cWe stay out in the cold and work hard. You make so much money because of your drivers.\u201d</p> <p>The confrontation appeared to have been triggered by the removal of the guaranteed hourly rate.</p> <p>Adeel Nazim, 30, who worked 95 hours for \u00a3291 in Leeds, told the Guardian: \u201cIt is not worth being out for the money they are paying. We are sat in the freezing cold, sometimes waiting for two or three hours for a job. If this is the way they are going to treat us, it is really not on.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "Where once a trip to the jewellers was a rite of passage for those wishing to tie the knot, thousands of people, mostly men, are now prepared to buy an engagement ring online. 77 Diamonds is a business set up to cater for the changing consumer habits of a generation which chooses a date by a swipe of their phone and probably booked a Valentines night out online. The company, based in a workshop up a scruffy narrow staircase behind a restaurant in central London , has caused a bit of a stir in the UK\u2019s diamond industry by undercutting bigger players and removing the need for personal consultations in a jewellery store. Tobias Kormind, who founded 77 Diamonds in 2005 after stints at investment bank Morgan Stanley and helping to restructure online trading platform Interactive Investor, says one client spent \u00a3120,000 on a ring without ever seeing it in person. Another ordered a \u00a3500,000 piece online and paid a deposit, only flying in to the company\u2019s Mayfair showroom for a viewing once it was close to completion. Clients include Premier League footballers and captains of industry. Most of the company\u2019s clients are not splashing quite that much cash, but more than half spend as much as \u00a33,000 online. Opening a leather box which looks like it might contain luxury chocolates, Kormind reveals two diamonds the size of throat lozenges. One has a rather glitzy cut that looks like it might be happy nestling at the throat of an Oscar nominee while the other is cut with an art deco-style similar to rings worn by Elizabeth Taylor and Beyonc\u00e9. They\u2019re both worth north of \u00a31m and are likely to be made into bespoke pieces. \u201cWe want to be a modern version of Tiffany and be an aspirational brand,\u201d says Kormind, a 44-year-old Dane who went to school in Oxfordshire. \u201cIt\u2019s not just about selling diamonds cheaply it\u2019s about craftsmanship. If you want people to refer you, you need to have that quality product, service and design.\u201d Kormind first set up the diamond sales site in 2005 while working for Marketing 77, a firm that helped luxury brands including Estee Lauder and Anya Hindmarch set up transactional websites. Three years later, he wanted to focus on the diamonds and teamed up with his wife, Ira, and business partner Vadim Weinig to buy out the business. Kormind funded his side of the buy-out with a few hundred thousand earned during his time working in banking as well as from remortgaging his flat. After a year of improving the website and building better relationships with diamond suppliers, turnover grew from about \u00a3400,000 to \u00a32.4m. Today sales are about \u00a318m and expected to rise to nearly \u00a325m this year, according to Kormind. He says the business is profitable and looking at taking on outside investment to help build its international presence. As the price of diamonds in the UK has risen between 15% and 20% since the Brexit vote, because the pound has fallen against dollar in which they are priced, Kormind says clients are choosing to spend about the same amount but tweaking the size, or other factors to meet their budget. He says 77 Diamonds is able to offer jewellery as much as 70% cheaper than well-known businesses such as Graff or Tiffany partly because it bypasses the traditional wholesale markets and goes straight to the diamond cutters and polishers in India, the US and Antwerp. The group has access to about 400,000 stones, but only a fraction of this is held as stock helping to keep costs down. The jewellery is made to order with most of the gold and platinum rings cast at a firm based in Birmingham and then fitted with diamonds in the London workshop. In a tiny hot room, 77 Diamonds\u2019 craftsmen sit at wooden benches curved like hairdresser\u2019s sinks. The worktops are covered in exotic-looking tools \u2013 thin rasps that could have come out of a dentist\u2019s kit, pointed tools with grips like small door handles and more emery boards than a manicurist could ever need. Leathery cradles looped under the benches in case any precious items are dropped also hold piles of pliers and other tools. Diamond setters Jason and Dean, who\u2019ve previously done work for the likes of DeBeers and Cartier, reckon they have sat next to each other for nearly 30 years. With the steady hand and confidence of a master craftsman Jason takes tiny grains of diamond from a small wooden tray with a lick of spit and a fine tool shaped like a blunt toothpick. He then fits them into tiny recesses drilled in the ring. While this scene could be from the era of Dickens, it is offset by a futuristic laser welding machine used for cutting rings down to size. \u201cAbout 90% of the jewellery sold in the UK isn\u2019t made here and we are clawing a little bit of that back,\u201d Kormind says. \u201cWe work with all the largest manufacturing groups and they all comply with the Kimberley Process. We don\u2019t work with someone who doesn\u2019t know where the diamonds are from.\u201d Set up in 2000 in collaboration with a group of governments, the Kimberley Process is designed to stop diamonds being used to fund wars. The action against so-called conflict diamonds has been widely praised, but Global Witness, one of the NGOs that helped draft the Kimberley Process, resigned in 2011 over concerns it did not act to stop trade of diamonds where there are wider human rights abuses. Kormind says he believes in the system but technology can add even more traceability to the market. He\u2019d like to see every single diamond traced right back to the mine it came from. He adds that one of 77 Diamonds\u2019 casters uses 80% recycled gold and he wants to introduce Fairtrade gold within the next 12 months.",

    "webTitle": "For sale: Co-op Bank looks for buyers", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The Co-operative Bank has put itself up for sale, four years after it nearly collapsed and had to be bailed out by US hedge funds. Amid persistent speculation over its long-term future, the loss-making bank said its board had decided to look for buyers, as well as look at other ways of bolstering its financial position. Speculation about potential buyers immediately focused on private equity houses or so-called challenger banks such as TSB, owned by Sabadell of Spain, Clydesdale and Yorkshire Bank, Virgin Money, and Santander. While a sale appears to be the preferred route, options including a stock market flotation are also being considered. A break-up of the bank could also attract bidders from specialist banks for parcels of loans and customers. Dennis Holt, the bank\u2019s chairman, said it had now cut costs and sold troubled loans to begin to seek a buyer for the Manchester-based operation with 4 million customers and 105 branches. \u201cSince we began work on the bank\u2019s turnaround, the board has always been clear that we would need to build capital for the future. We are now commencing a sale process, alongside other options. The bank\u2019s ethical heritage and customer proposition will be a central consideration in this,\u201d he said, adding a sale had always been a potential outcome. When problems at the Co-op Bank emerged in 2013 it was discovered that the bank \u2013 then 100% owned by the Co-operative Group of supermarkets and funeral homes \u2013 needed \u00a31.5bn. Paul Flowers, its former chairman, was later fined for possessing cocaine, crystal meth and ketamine and was dismissed as a minister by the Methodist church earlier this year. The troubles at the bank left a cloud over the co-operative sector and put the Co-op Group under huge financial pressure. The Group now owns just 20% and said it was \u201csupportive of the plan to find the bank a new home\u201d. The mutual has 2 million members who are bank customers. \u201cOur goal is to ensure the continued provision of the type of co-operative banking products our members want,\u201d it said. The separation of the pension fund \u2013 which would be important to any bidder \u2013 is yet to be agreed. The bank would not put a value on its operations or indicate how much extra funds it needs. The bank is meeting the capital requirements set out by international regulators but not the requirement specifically tailored by the Bank of England\u2019s Prudential Regulation Authority. A year ago the Co-op Group wrote down the value of its \u00a3333m investment in the bank to just \u00a3185m and again to \u00a3140m six months later. This appears to indicate that the bank is worth around \u00a3750m. If the bank cannot find a buyer it could ask its existing shareholders for more cash, try to lure new investors or force its bondholders to take losses. Liam Coleman, the chief executive, said it was \u201cbusiness as usual\u201d for customers \u2013 which have fallen in number by 700,000 since the problems emerged. He said the turnaround plan had been slowed bylow interest rates and the \u201csheer scale\u201d of the transformation, in part required after the bank\u2019s merger with the Britannia Building Society just as the financial crisis started. \u201cWe\u2019d just to like to say what a great bank we have here ... we have a growing business, we have a growing current account business. We have made progress in the last three years of a turnaround plan.\u201d It is not clear what any buyer might want to do with the Co-op name which it can currently use after writing its ethical approach into its articles of association when it was undergoing its restructuring. Any future owner would have to decide whether to continue this. The business secretary \u2013 Greg Clark \u2013 and the Financial Conduct Authority can also review the name if it misleads the public. Save Our Bank, a campaign group which claims to have 10,000 supporters said it wanted to buy more shares in the bank. \u201cOur goal is for the bank to succeed as an ethical, customer-owned and led bank,\u201d it said. The Bank of England\u2019s PRA is watching the situation closely. \u201cWe will continue to assess the bank\u2019s progress in building greater financial resilience over the coming months,\u201d the PRA said. In 2013, when it was still owned by the Co-operative Group, the bank had tried to buy TSB from Lloyds Banking Group. TSB is now owned by Sabadell of Spain and is seen as a potential suitor for the scaled-back Co-op Bank.",

A warning that \u201cserious industrial action will occur\u201d if the company presses ahead with the plans is carried in a letter sent by Len McCluskey, leader of the Unite union. He is due to hold talks with senior management at the car giant\u2019s Mini plant in Cowley, Oxfordshire, next Monday. BMW, which made record pre-tax profits of \u20ac9bn (\u00a37.6bn) in 2015, intends to close two defined-benefit pension schemes to future contributions from June 2017, and shift workers over to its less generous defined-contribution pension scheme. The changes affect workers at all the company\u2019s British bases, including the plants at Cowley and Swindon, the Rolls-Royce plant at Goodwood near Chichester in West Sussex, Hams Hall near Birmingham, and Farnborough in Hampshire. Unite said it had put forward \u201caffordable proposals\u201d that would have kept the schemes open but said BMW has indicated it will close as originally planned. The Unite general secretary said there was growing anger among BMW\u2019s British staff, with 96% indicating a willingness to take industrial action in a consultative ballot. \u201cIt is evident that, if we do not resolve the differences that exist, then the likelihood of serious industrial action will occur,\u201d he added. \u201cAt a recent meeting of senior Unite shop stewards from all plants, I was able to gauge the concern, frustration and anger of our members,\u201d McCluskey said.

Spending increased by a meagre 0.4% in January, according to Visa\u2019s consumer spending index. The year-on-year growth rate was a five-month low, which followed December\u2019s robust 2.5% increase. The spending tracker highlighted a grim period for clothing retailers, with the amount Britons spent on their wardrobes dropping 3.8% \u2013 the biggest decline since April 2012. \u201cClothing and household goods retailers experienced a particularly difficult January,\u201d said Visa UK and Ireland managing director Kevin Jenkins. \u201cThe traditional start of year sales did little to lift clothing spend, which saw the biggest drop in nearly five years. The high street as a whole suffered a disappointing month too, with spend falling at the quickest rate in four years.\u201d It came as the BRC-Springboard footfall tracker showed shopper numbers dropped 1.3% last month. \u201cThe drop in footfall across the UK\u2019s bricks and mortar destinations in January may be a sign of tougher things to come in 2017,\u201d said Springboard analyst Diane Wehrle. \u201cOf significance is that footfall is correlating closely with retail sales, with all sales results published so far showing a poorer performance in January [2017] than in January 2016.\u201d Last month official figures showed Britain\u2019s retailers suffering a surprise end-of-year slump in sales, which analysts suggested was a sign that rising prices since the Brexit vote are starting to hurt people\u2019s spending power. Sales volumes dropped 1.9% in December although for the final three months of the year sales were still ahead 1.2% on the previous quarter. The Brexit vote\u2019s blow to the pound has made imports more expensive and some of that impact is now being passed on to consumers, with inflation hitting its highest level for more than two years in December. The Visa data also highlights the growing importance of the \u201cexperience economy\u201d as consumers spend more of their disposable income on doing things rather than buying them. The monthly snapshot showed spending on hotels, restaurants and bars up nearly 6% on the previous January while spending on recreation and culture was up 3.1%. After increasing solidly over the final quarter of 2016, the spending barometer points to a \u201cmuch softer pace\u201d of expenditure growth at the start of 2017, according to Annabel Fiddes, an economist at IHS Markit. \u201cA key threat to expenditure in the coming months is building inflationary pressures in the economy, partly due to the effects of a weaker sterling exchange rate feeding through to consumers,\u201d explained Fiddes. \u201cAs a result, households\u2019 purchasing power will be squeezed further which, combined with relatively muted consumer confidence, may lead expenditure to settle on a slower growth trajectory in 2017.\u201d",
