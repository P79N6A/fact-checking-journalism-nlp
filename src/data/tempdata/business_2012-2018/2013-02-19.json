      "bodyText": "Electricity firm EDF has confirmed it wants the UK government to sign 40-year contracts to support building new nuclear reactors in Britain \u2013 as the national energy regulator warned prices are likely to rise higher than expected. The French-owned company is in talks with ministers over \"contracts for difference\" funding, under which the government guarantees generators will be paid a minimum price for electricity from new nuclear plants: if the market price falls lower than this \"strike price\" then a surcharge will be added to customers' bills; if it rises higher there would be a refund. The Guardian reported on Tuesday that in order to keep the strike price at below the politically crucial \u00a3100 a megawatt hour, ministers and officials are proposing the contracts will last for up to 40 years, double the original timescale. On Tuesday, it emerged that EDF's chairman, Henri Proglio, told analysts and investors that the company was in talks over 40-year contracts when the company published its annual results in Paris last week. The UK's Department of Energy and Climate Change (Decc) said on Monday no final agreement had been reached. However insiders acknowledge such long deals could have trouble passing EU state aid rules, and nuclear critics who are already angry the government has reneged on a promise that there would be no public subsidy for new nuclear power. Pressure on ministers to get a deal with EDF was highlighted on Tuesday when Alistair Buchanan, head of the energy regulator, Ofgem, warned that UK customers face higher bills for years to come as gas imports rise to replace ageing power stations taken out of service. In an attack on previous policy, Buchanan said the situation had arisen because of \"the car crash of a policy-driven vision of sustainability and the environment from 2004-08 \u2013 that needed massive sums of money backing nascent technologies \u2013 smashing into the financial crisis.\" Energy experts said longer contracts for new nuclear power would help bring the price guarantee down from early estimates of \u00a3140-160 per unit to under \u00a3100, and bring down the overall cost because they would reduce risk and make it cheaper for EDF to borrow the estimated \u00a312bn-\u00a316bn building cost. \"At the moment that certainty would appear to be more of a benefit to the owner-operator of a new plant, but clearly the government needs to get things moving on generation new builds,\" said Martin Young, head of European utilities research at Nomura. \"It would support the government's low-carbon policy and reduce the volatility in power prices.\" But ministers could also face a headache if energy companies demand similar subsidies to build new gas plants. \"This is a real possibility because the incentive to build new gas power plants is lost if market prices are distorted by significant nuclear capacity supported by very rich contracts for difference,\" said Nigel Robinson, head of power advisory at Investec bank. According to Ofgem, gas is likely to double to 60% to 70% of power generation by the end of this decade. Buchanan said reserve margins for generation capacity were set to fall from 14% to 5% within three years, though he played down the threat of power cuts to households because many energy-intensive industries have contracts that stipulate their supply can be cut at times of peak demand. His warnings are a challenge to the chancellor, George Osborne, who has promoted a \"dash for gas\" as the way of keeping the lights on and keeping energy bills low for consumers and businesses.",

It makes it harder for the sector to secure its aim of setting a spring 2014 deadline for the public to submit PPI claims.

But concern about the state of its existing European business was one reason for broker Bernstein Research cutting its recommendation from market perform to underperform and its price target from 170p to 135p. Nor should investors hope for a boost from its US joint venture Verizon Wireless, said Bernstein analyst Robin Bienenstock. There has been much speculation about the joint venture: would Vodafone buy out its partner Verizon's stake, sell its own shareholding, or be taken over entirely by the US group? But Bienenstock was sceptical of a positive outcome whatever it decides to do.</p> <p>On Europe, she said the company's assets in their current form were worth just 38p a share:</p> <blockquote> The landscape of European telecoms has changed dramatically in the last year; Vodafone must belatedly pick its poison. With no structural change we expect Vodafone's European assets to shrink by 23% in the next three years. <br> As neither the lowest cost provider nor a differentiated operator Vodafone seems destined to decline with the wireless only segment. Vodafone can choose structural decline mitigated by dramatic cost cutting and some increased spend, or it can try to buy its way out of the problem.  If Vodafone chooses not to buy wireline assets we think it will not sell Verizon Wireless as notwithstanding the deteriorating structure of the US, it will likely remain a better market than Europe for wireless-only assets 3-5 years hence. If Vodafone does buy some wireline assets it risks becoming a forced seller of Verizon Wireless...or if they don't sell investors will rightly discount Verizon Wireless within Vodafone as they wait for Vodafone to eventually finish their wireline footprint at a much higher price. We think that Vodafone has left it too late to pick their poison. </blockquote> <p>Other possibilities included buying Liberty Global - also said to be a rival bidder for Kabel Deutschland. Bienenstock said:</p> <blockquote> This would after all be entirely in keeping with Vodafone's corporate history of buying at the top. But in this case even assuming the sale of other assets (Egypt, partial IPO of India), we estimate that Vodafone would be worth just 140p (and expect a dividend cut of 50%). </blockquote> <p>On the US she said:</p> <blockquote> We think that Vodafone shareholders will not enjoy the value creating event with Verizon Wireless for which so many hope. We think that Verizon Wireless' valuation is at its peak, and that the US wireless market has already become significantly less attractive structurally. But we think that Vodafone management's preoccupation with scale and the narrowing solution set they face will prevent them from profitably breaking up the company. <br> Vodafone might consider a partial stake sale to fund investments in Europe. But a partial stake sale would remove the floor in Vodafone's share price as it removes any hope Vodafone shareholders might have for a full takeover, and we think Verizon (who cannot be blind to Vodafone's problems) are unlikely to offer a full price.  If, in spite of the longer term prospects for European wireless, Vodafone were to decide to part with their US business and reinvest in Europe the cost would now be so great that investors would not benefit. And history suggests that even were they to return all of the proceeds to shareholders through special dividends the share price would simply deflate to the value of the rump \u2013hardly a palatable option for a team preoccupied with scale.  Vodafone might instead hope for another solution \u2013like a merger with AT&amp;T after a sale of Verizon Wireless. But Vodafone shareholders should be under no illusions about AT&amp;T's interest in expansion\u2026they may well want to expand overseas but not at any price and certainly not when a much better alternative \u2013 AMX [Mexico's Am\u00e9rica M\u00f3vil] \u2013seems a so much more natural fit especially if that company expands into Europe. </blockquote> <p>Meanwhile an objection by the German cartel office to Kabel Deutschland's proposed takeover of Tele Columbus could have repercussions for any Vodafone move in Germany. Espirito Santo said:</p> <blockquote> That the Tele Columbus acquisition has been blocked will raise question marks as to whether Federal Cartel Office approval would be possible in the event that Vodafone were to launch a bid for Kabel Deutschland. These concerns are valid but we do not believe the FCO's decision with respect to Tele Columbus closes the door to a move by Vodafone. <br> In our view the key difference between the situations is the ownership of the customer networks. Whilst Vodafone's broadband business in Germany competes against Kabel Deutschland it does so on Deutsche Telekom's infrastructure rather than its own network. This is in contrast to Tele Columbus which has its own cable network in several cities in Eastern Germany. </blockquote> <p>Investors also decided to check out of <strong>InterContinental Hotels</strong> after recent rises in the group's share price.</p> <p>The owner of the Crowne Plaza, Holiday Inns and InterContinental brands reported an 11% jump in full year profits to $614m, helped by a good performance in the US and growth in emerging markets. It plans to sell its New York Barclay and London Park Lane hotels, with the $700m proceeds expected to be given back to shareholders.</p> <p>But with its shares hitting a twelve month high during Monday's trading, profit taking pushed them 36p lower to \u00a319.53.</p> <p>But <strong>Standard Chartered</strong> added 41.5p to \u00a317.17 after a positive note from Morgan Stanley, which raised its rating from equal weight to overweight. It said: </p> <blockquote> Standard is now our preferred name among the UK-Asian banks, versus. <strong>HSBC</strong>, as relative valuation has reached parity. HSBC looks fairly valued on lower revenue growth expectations, while an improving Asian macro should reduce asset quality concerns for Standard, driving a performance reversal. <br> </blockquote> <p>HSBC recovered from early falls after announcing the $2.1bn sale of its businesses in Panama, closing 2.8p higher at 728.8p.</p> <p><strong>RSA Insurance</strong> rose 3.9p to 136.3p after a buy note from Deutsche Bank. It said:</p> <blockquote> It's 2013 that matters, not 2012. RSA reports its 2012 results on 20 February. However, the key to further share price performance lies in the guidance that we expect the (partly new) management team to provide for 2013 - 2014 on the back of the geographical and product mix changes that it is implementing. In the meantime, with positive tailwinds from foreign exchange helping our forecasts by around 3%, we remain positive. </blockquote> <p>Among the mid-caps <strong>Drax</strong>, the coal-fired power station owner, climbed 37p to 641.5p after unveiling more detail about its plans to become a biomass-fuelled generator.</p> <p>The company plans to convert its first unit to biomass in April, with the second in 2014. Meanwhile full year profits dropped from \u00a3338m to \u00a3190m, due to higher operating costs and investment in accelerating its biomass plans.</p> <p><strong>Ladbrokes</strong> was lifted 9.1p to 230.3p after Investec moved from hold to buy. After some delays, the group is set to complete the rollout of its new online sportsbook in the first quarter, and with an improvement in its trading performance, analyst James Hollins said the outlook for both retail and digital was promising. He said:</p> <blockquote> We move to a buy on Ladbrokes, with positives on the recent uptick in retail performance (strong machines growth and incremental margin improvements) partially offset by concerns over the group's ability to drive a significant turnaround in short- and medium-term digital returns. On balance, we project that the digital platform, driven by (1) superior technology, (2) a strong UK brand, and (3) margin enhancement can drive strong divisional earnings growth. Compounded by positive retail trends and increased shop estate roll-out, the group earnings outlook and excellent cash generation now look undervalued against our new 250p price target. </blockquote> <p>Finally, structural steelwork maker <strong>Severfield-Rowen</strong>, whose chief executive resigned in January after a profit warning due to cost overruns, fell 3.5p to 75p after it said it had talked to major shareholders about a possible \u00a350m fundraising. In a trading update it said its banks had agreed to waive certain covenants, and talks were continuing about amending its facilities. In a review after January's warning it said it would take a \u00a320m hit to the profit and loss account due to problems at nine out of its top 70 contracts. Analyst Andy Douglas at Jefferies said:</p> <blockquote> The near-term outlook remains challenging; management is tasked with getting the group on sound financial footing, executing near-term reorganisation and overhead reduction programme, before looking to improve margins towards aspiration of 5%-6% \"over time\". The next update will be results announcement for [2012], along with terms of the equity fundraising and amended banking facilities - expected by 28 February. <br> </blockquote> <p>Analysts at N+1 Singer issued a sell note, saying:</p> <blockquote> The quantum of the impact from these issues is concerning, particularly in the wake of recent negative updates. Severfield is the market leader and the indicated shareholder support is encouraging, although it is difficult to assess potential equity value until there is more clarity on the funding situation. <br> </blockquote> <p>And Canaccord Genuity said:</p> <blockquote> We withdraw our forecasts until the group publishes its [2012 results], although would suggest that for 2012 a headline loss of around \u00a318m is likely.

      "bodyText": "Leading shares moved to a new five year high, but Vodafone missed out on the gains. The FTSE 100 finished up 60.88 points at 6379.07, its highest level since 2 January 2008, as positive German business confidence figures and a bright start on Wall Street after Monday's holiday sparked some buying interest from investors.

French president Francois Hollande said his country would invest in Greece's struggling economy on his brief visit to Athens today. AP reports: Hollande said French firms were expected to participate in Greece's huge privatization program, a key condition of the country's bailout program. The government is focusing on energy, water, transport and railway deals. \"I am here in Athens to mobilize French companies so that they invest in Greece,\" Hollande said. \"That is in the interests of Greece and France alike.\" France has long been a major arms supplier to Greece, which was until recently one of Europe's top defense spenders due to an arms race with regional rival Turkey. But Hollande said he was not in Athens to sell military hardware. \"We must provide the Greeks with solidarity, aid and above all show confidence which will help restore growth,\" he said. Hollande also confirmed France would grow by less than previously expected this year: Everyone knows that for 2013, we will not reach our target, which was 0.8 percent. He said a new growth target would be announced by the end of next month. As we said earlier, there was little local coverage of the event given the 24 strike called by Greek media. The pound has hit a new 7-month low of $1.5429 against the dollar, with trade weighted sterling dropping to 79.6, its lowest for nearly 16 months. The rumoured S&amp;P downgrade seems to be weighing on the UK currency, ahead of unemployment figures and the latest minutes from the Bank of England's monetary policy committee, both due tomorrow morning. Ireland will look at further sales of bank stakes and debt built up when it rescued the banking sector, its finance minister has said. Michael Noonan said, as quoted by Reuters: As we showed already, if we can redeem investments at par, we will redeem them... We will explore the possible sale of further tranches of these particular assets this year. It sold Irish Life to Canada's Great-West for \u20ac1.7bn a month after disposing of \u20ac1bn worth of debt in Bank of Ireland. Noonan also said he was confident the government would not have any difficulties with the legality of its recent promissory note deal. S&amp;P is not commenting on those UK downgrade rumours. I hesitate to even mention this, but here goes. Earlier there was once more talk of a possible downgrade of the UK's triple A rating by Standard &amp; Poor's, perhaps after the market closed today (which market was not clear - UK? US?) And as was swiftly pointed out, this would seem to go against comments made by S&amp;P just last week. Surely any ratings agency would wait and see what's in the March 20 UK budget before making any move? Over in the US, a weaker than expected housing market indicator. Confidence among American home builders dipped slightly in February after reaching a seven year high the previous month. The National Association of Home Builders/Wells Fargo index slipped from 47 in January to 46, below expectations of a rise to 48. The NAHB said the decline came amid uncertainties about jobs and rising costs for building materials. This has not stopped the Dow Jones Industrial Average from adding nearly 50 points in early trading, after its Presidents Day break on Monday. (And apologies by the way that putting my byline on the blog has removed Simon's picture after this morning's interest.) While Greece's current account deficit may be reducing, times are still certainly tight in the country. According to the latest car figures, only one new Ferrari was registered in Greece throughout 2012. Good luck to that driver getting around. By comparison, 21 new Ferraris were registered in 2007. And with that, I'll hand over to my colleague Nick Fletcher. Iberia workers continue their second day of strikes, which will see 1,022 flights cancelled by Friday. Here are some pictures coming in from the airport today, with scenes far calmer than yesterday, when riot police dragged out protesters after they stormed Madrid's main airport. Just to remind everyone, the strikes are over plans to cut 3,807 jobs and reduce routes in an attempt to stop losses which totalled \u20ac262m in the first nine months of 2012. In an interview with Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung newspaper, Bundesbank boss, and ECB policymaker, Jens Weidmann said: The G20 countries share the opinion that devaluation races know no winners. Also in the future, protectionism and currency manipulation should not be used to fight against the difficult economic situation in some countries. That is an important signal. Poland could delay its entry into the eurozone after the PM Donald Tusk said the country would need to change its constitution first. Less than a third of Poles are in favour of joining the euro and Tusk thinks he will have a tough time pushing the changes through parliament. He said: It is essential to have a constitutional majority to take this decision. There will be no such majority, unless there is a widespread belief that this is good for Poland. Now compare this with what he said last year, and it seems he has cooled to the idea of joining. He said in December: In front of us is a decision on whether we want to be part of the heart of Europe [\u2026] with the common currency at its core, or a peripheral state with its own currency. The president Bronislaw Komorowski has said the country should wait until after the 2015 elections before making any decision. Poland is obliged to join the single currency as part of its agreement on entering the EU. Greece's current account deficit narrowed last year to its lowest level since joining the euro. The gap narrowed by 73% in 2012 to \u20ac5.58bn helped by falling imports and lower interest payments after a sovereign debt cut, according to the Greek central bank. It shrank from 9.9% of GDP in 2011 to 2.9% of GDP in 2012 and is a long way of historic highs of 14.7% of GDP in 2008. Due to austerity measures the Government hopes to eliminate the current account deficit by 2014. Sterling ticked up slightly, away from seven-month lows of yesterday against the dollar, but only up by 0.1% to $1.5482, as some investors cash in on the recent falls by closing their short positions. Some have suggested there will be little movement ahead of tomorrow's release of the most recent minutes from the Bank of England MPC meeting. However, chances of a boost are unlikely, with hedge funds selling the pound in anticipation of looser monetary policy from incoming Governor Mark Carney. Valentin Marinov, head of European G10 currency strategy at Citi told Reuters: It feels like the sterling move we have seen has occurred very quickly and that could encourage some investors to take some profit, but it will only be a pause. Ahead of the BoE and Fed minutes tomorrow, risks could be still on the downside, especially if we see evidence that the FOMC (Federal Open Markets Committee) members discussed reducing the pace of its asset purchases if the US recovery is sustained. The French president posed with PM Samaras for pictures, but little coverage on the event is expected by Greek media, who are staging a 24 hour strike ahead of a nationwide strike tomorrow. Greek news websites have not been updated, and rolling state news channels are showing footage of Hollande's arrival, but providing no commentary on the trip. Greece's government were furious that journalists chose today to strike to coincide with the arrival of Hollande. A spokesman blamed the opposition party, telling AP: The journalists\u2019 union leadership succumbed to the usual party aims and Syriza\u2019s plan to cause a media blackout during the visit of French President Francois Hollande. He added that the opposition party \u201cdoes not hesitate to damage the country\u2019s international image.\u201d Our economics editor Larry Elliott writes The world\u2019s richest countries saw their economies contract for the first time in almost four years during the final three months of 2012, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation said. The Paris-based think tank said gross domestic product across its 34 member states fell by 0.2% - breaking a period of rising activity stretching back to a 2.3% slump in output in the first quarter of 2009. All the major economies of the OECD - the US, Japan, Germany, France, Italy and the UK - have already reported falls in output at the end of 2012, with the think tank noting that the steepest declines had been seen in the European Union, where GDP fell by 0.5%. Canada is the only member of the G7 currently on course to register an increase in national output. The 0.2% decrease followed a 0.3% expansion in the third quarter, and resulted in a slowdown in the annual rate of growth in the developed world. GDP growth in the OECD was 0.7% higher in the fourth quarter of 2012 than it was a year earlier, down from the 1.2% annual pace of expansion in the year to the third quarter of 2012. Among the major seven economies, the US showed the fastest annual growth, expanding by 1.5% between the fourth quarter of 2011 and the fourth quarter of 2012. Italy was the weakest performer, contracting by 2.7% over the same period. For 2012 as a whole, GDP growth in the OECD stood at 1.3%, down from 1.9% in 2011. A brief flick through the readers comments, I see KhakiSuit asks: I haven\u2019t been around for a while, but who is this faceless \u201cSimon Neville\u201d? And why does a young Zyzz look-a-like (\u2018mirin brah?) and a woman advertising online lingerie come up when I google him? Therefore, to appease him/her and other curious parties a picture has now been added. I can assure all readers I am not said lingerie model. But for some, the ZEW figures are meaningless. Reaction coming in for the better-than-expected ZEW index results. Carsten Brzeski at ING Bank NV said: The ZEW index has not the best track record when it comes to predicting German economic activity. In fact, since 2006, the index had a tendency to \u201cmiss\u201d the periods of strong growth. Since mid-2011, however, the components of the ZEW and the Ifo have broadly stayed in tune. With this in mind, we could see another increase of Germany\u2019s leading confidence indicator, the Ifo index, at the end of this week. Without any single hard data for the year 2013, the prospects for the German economy look promising. Even if the real economy only lives up to half the expectations recently created by soft indicators, any fears of a technical recession should turn out to have been unjustified. Over at IG, Alastair McCaig added: This morning\u2019s German ZEW economic sentiment figures should ensure that the market is given a sense of direction, and it will be interesting to see if it can be as strong as it was last month. The ZEW sentiment indicator index was up to 48.2 vs 31.5 in January, with current conditions index at 5.2 points vs 7.1 points in January. It found market experts think business activity may pick up speed moderately and two=thirds of respondents expect no change to the ECB rates for at least six months. The rest expect an increase during that time. Sentiment is at the highest level since April 2010. For those uninitiated with the ZEW, it is data complied by the German firm, the Center for European Economic Research, which questions financial experts throughout Europe every month, making a medium-term forecast about Germany 's economic situation. They are asked to weigh up the current situation and predict the future direction of the economy. For all components of the survey, responses are restricted to positive, negative, or unchanged. Questions range from a qualitative assessment of the direction of inflation, interest rates, exchange rates and the stock market in the next six months. Over to Greece where our correspondent Helena Smith says the French president Francois Hollande has arrived in Athens and is making his way with prime minister Antonis Samaras to his downtown office. She writes: Government officials are holding much in store in the French president's flying visit. Like Angela Merkel's similar six-hour stopover, four months ago, Hollande's tour is highly symbolic visit with officials describing it as vital to shoring up confidence in debt-choked country. \"By coming here, at this moment in time, Hollande sends a very important message to markets and EU states that Greece is not a lost case and will make it,\" one official in the tripartite coalition government told me. \"It is essential, right now, that we are given political support to get investments moving. As one of the two pillars of the EU, Hollande can give high-profile political support. He can appeal to his public and send a message to other EU publics that now is the time to invest in Greece because its economy has stabilised.\" Unlike Merkel's visit which was marred by massive demonstrations no protests are planned - even if opposition parties say the visit is more about Paris securing arms deals with Greece. Instead, Hollande is seen as the leader who best embodies the desire to see \"anti-austerity and growth\" replace the constant budget cuts that have predominated since the crisis erupted in Athens three years ago. Sticking with Spain for the moment, the Government sold \u20ac4bn of three and nine month bonds - the top end of its sales target. The yield on the nine-month bills was 1.144% and the three-months at 0.421%, which was slightly lower than the 0.441% yield on previous sale in January. Real estate business Reyal Urbis has filed for insolvency after failing to renegotiate its debt levels with lenders. Shares were suspended, having fallen 99% since 2007 at the height of Spain's property boom. The company has until Saturday to reach a last-ditch agreement before going under. The collapse is the second biggest in Spanish history, after Martinsa, another building company, fell at the start of the crisis. Chairman and majority shareholder, Rafael Santamaria, said he was confident an agreement with the banks could be reached. Good morning and welcome to another day of our rolling coverage of the eurozone crisis. Today we turn our attentions back to Spain following clashes late yesterday afternoon with Spanish police and striking airline workers for Iberia for day two of a five day strike. We also look toBratislava for the eurozone conference \u201cshaping a genuine economic and monetary union\u201d including a speech from ECB member J\u00f6rg Asmussen. While over in Athens, French president Francois Hollande is meeting with his Greek counterparts president Karolos Papoulias and PM Antonis Samaras And finally, in Zurich, the Swiss National Bank chairman Thomas Jordan speaks at the Swiss Institute of International Studies",

Thompson said: We will be investing significant amount of capital over [the next] two years, as we transform the business. [Earnings] in this period will be impacted adversely by the increasing costs of carbon. However as we move beyond this investment phase... we are confident we will deliver attractive returns for our shareholders. Shares in the company have jumped 27.5p to 632p on the news, making it the biggest riser in the FTSE 250. Liberum Capital issued a buy note, saying the results looked good: The first unit biomass conversion will be completed in April. Storage and handling construction also on track. Outlook very much focused on execution. But Angelos Anastasiou at Cantor Fitzgerald said: These results are slightly, but not significantly, better than expected. Drax is progressing with its revised biomass plans. However, we believe that the plans are not risk free, and the group remains exposed to carbon costs even after the planned unit conversions. Hence, we reiterate our sell recommendation and our target price of 523p.",

It has only taken 11 cases to tax tribunals,\" she said.</p> <p>The 11 tax avoidance promoters taken to tribunal were fined just \u00a35,000 each despite the maximum penalty being \u00a31m. Hodge said HMRC had never fined an individual for failing to disclose a scheme on their tax return.</p> <p>Hodge said HMRC must \"robustly\" crack down on tax avoidance promoters that are \"costing the country billions, as the public are struggling with less money in their pockets\". She added: \"It offends the sense of fairness.\"</p> <p>She called on tax avoiders and the businesses creating tax avoidance schemes to be \"named and shamed\".</p> <p>Hodge said businessmen promoting schemes such as those used by Jimmy Carr, Gary Barlow and Wayne Rooney were winning a \"game of cat and mouse\" with HMRC, responding to the discovery of their schemes by moving on to create new ones.</p> <p>At the public accounts committee (PAC) hearing Aiden James, director of Tax Trade Advisers, a specialist in income tax avoidance, told MPs that all of the schemes his company previously marketed were now illegal.</p> <p>Ian Swales, a Liberal Democrat member of the PAC, asked: \"All the schemes you have marketed are now illegal, so you are now looking for the next loophole \u2013 is that a fair description of your business?\" To which James replied: \"That is how it works, yes.\"</p> <p>Hodge said HMRC only knows about 46% of tax avoidance schemes, and that if HMRC does track down a scheme that breaks the rules the promoter calls in barristers to plead that it had a \"reasonable excuse\" for not disclosing the scheme in order to escape a fine.</p> <p>At the hearing she named QCs Jonathan Peacock, Rex Bretten, Andrew Thornhill and Giles Goodfellow as \"the guys who prostitute themselves to these schemes\".</p> <p>On top of the \u00a35bn a year known to be lost to tax schemes, Hodge said HMRC had very little hope of collecting a further \u00a310.2bn. \"We are desperate to grow the economy.

      "bodyText": "The exchequer loses at least \u00a35bn a year because the taxman is failing to crack down on \"morally wrong\" tax avoidance schemes similar to the one used by comedian Jimmy Carr, the chair of the Commons public accounts committee warns today. Margaret Hodge, the former Labour minister, said rich businessmen designing the schemes were \"running rings\" around HMRC. She said HMRC had an \"appallingly bad record\" at catching tax cheats, having fined just 11 people for promoting tax avoidance since 2004 \u2013 despite 10,000 people a year coming forward to report tax avoidance schemes. A report by the PAC published on Tuesday says there is \"a lot of money to be made in selling avoidance schemes\", and commissions paid to the creators of the schemes can be up to 20% of the tax saved. Hodge told Lin Homer, chief executive and permanent secretary of HMRC, that she didn't want to be \"aggressive and awful about it\", but the agency's failure to crack down on tax avoidance was \"gobsmacking\". \"There has been huge growth, and appalling proliferation [in tax avoidance], and what has HMRC been up to? It has only taken 11 cases to tax tribunals,\" she said. The 11 tax avoidance promoters taken to tribunal were fined just \u00a35,000 each despite the maximum penalty being \u00a31m. Hodge said HMRC had never fined an individual for failing to disclose a scheme on their tax return. Hodge said HMRC must \"robustly\" crack down on tax avoidance promoters that are \"costing the country billions, as the public are struggling with less money in their pockets\". She added: \"It offends the sense of fairness.\" She called on tax avoiders and the businesses creating tax avoidance schemes to be \"named and shamed\". Hodge said businessmen promoting schemes such as those used by Jimmy Carr, Gary Barlow and Wayne Rooney were winning a \"game of cat and mouse\" with HMRC, responding to the discovery of their schemes by moving on to create new ones. At the public accounts committee (PAC) hearing Aiden James, director of Tax Trade Advisers, a specialist in income tax avoidance, told MPs that all of the schemes his company previously marketed were now illegal. Ian Swales, a Liberal Democrat member of the PAC, asked: \"All the schemes you have marketed are now illegal, so you are now looking for the next loophole \u2013 is that a fair description of your business?\" To which James replied: \"That is how it works, yes.\" Hodge said HMRC only knows about 46% of tax avoidance schemes, and that if HMRC does track down a scheme that breaks the rules the promoter calls in barristers to plead that it had a \"reasonable excuse\" for not disclosing the scheme in order to escape a fine. At the hearing she named QCs Jonathan Peacock, Rex Bretten, Andrew Thornhill and Giles Goodfellow as \"the guys who prostitute themselves to these schemes\". On top of the \u00a35bn a year known to be lost to tax schemes, Hodge said HMRC had very little hope of collecting a further \u00a310.2bn. \"We are desperate to grow the economy. Just think of the houses we could build and the pot holes we could fill with [these lost taxes] without adding to our [national] deficit,\" she said. \"It's megabucks.\" The PAC named Future Capital Partners and Ingenious Media as companies exploiting government tax breaks intended to encourage the film industry to help the rich avoid tax. Famous participants in schemes organised by Ingenious include footballers Steven Gerrard and Wayne Rooney and pop stars Peter Gabriel and Robbie Williams. Films financed by Ingenious include Avatar, Die Hard 4 and Die Hard 5 and Girl with the Pearl Earring.

      "bodyText": "David Cameron has pressed Royal Bank of Scotland executives to \"accelerate\" preparations towards allowing a sell-off of the state-owned bank, possibly before the next general election in 2015. The prime minister confirmed that the government was examining an \"interesting\" idea that would involve shares in the bank initially distributed to taxpayers for free. The Treasury would make a profit once the shares reached a certain price. \"These are all interesting questions for the future,\" Cameron said of a variation of an idea floated by the Liberal Democrats in 2011, and recently picked up by the Treasury minister, Sajid Javid. On Saturday, the Daily Mail and the Independent reported that Javid has been told by Chancellor George Osborne to draft plans for what was described as a \"give-away\" of RBS shares. This would help the government recoup a decent chunk of its \u00a345bn bailout of the bank. Cameron said \"I am keen to examine all possibilities for what we could do to put RBS in time back into the private sector. I can think of lots of exciting and interesting things to do but I don't have a fixed view.\" But the prime minister, who is in India, said his main focus was to ensure the bank was in a fit state to be sold off. \"The first job is to turn around the performance of RBS and to strengthen its balance sheet, strengthen its business and that's what [the chief executive] Stephen Hester and his team are doing.\" Cameron declined to specify what he meant by \"in time\", but made clear that the government's patience in RBS was not limitless. \"It's a huge undertaking, it was a very badly damaged institution,\" he said of the bank. \"But I think they are doing the right thing and obviously we want them to, where possible, accelerate the adjustments that they are making in terms of making it a strong organisation.\" The prime minister's interest in the public share option follows Vince Cable's speech earlier in February in which the business secretary outlined options for the future of RBS. Cable said: \"There is a range of options, from reprivatisation at a later stage to continued public ownership or mutualisation through public share distribution, as advocated by the Liberal Democrats. We should keep all of these options in play.\" But he later played down the idea telling Radio 4's Today programme that there was \"no immediate prospect\" of handing RBS shares over to the public. Fellow Lib Dem MP Stephen Williams was the driving force behind a plan drawn up by Portman Capital Partners to give RBS and Lloyds Banking Group shares to the 46 million adults registered to vote in the UK. A fixed nominal amount would have to be paid to the Treasury when the shares are sold, ensuring the government would recover the \u00a366bn bailout of UK banks. Government sources stressed that Cameron was adopting a cautious approach on RBS. On the one hand he is keen to ensure the taxpayer is compensated for the investment it has made, while on the other he is aware it would be wrong and counter-productive to act precipitously. \"It is better to wait and get it right than to rush and get it wrong,\" one source said. Other sources were more encouraging about the share plan. One senior figure told the Independent: \"There is a realisation that there is no prospect of RBS's share price rising to the level at which we bailed the bank out and it's not good for the bank or the government to hold on to our stake indefinitely. Obviously a give-away to taxpayers before the election, who after all paid for it in the first place, is very attractive.\"",
