But one of its major downsides is that it allows cranks and trolls to quickly and efficiently coalesce around ridiculous ideas. The latest bored-financial-nerd meme is this: the minting of a trillion-dollar platinum coin to save the US economy from the dithering of Congress.&#xa0;</p> <p>There is a Twitter hashtag \u2013 #mintthecoin \u2013 and a wan, spindly White House petition created on January 3 that needs around 25,000 signatures and currently has just under 2,000, which makes it resemble the winsomely pathetic Charlie Brown Christmas tree.&#xa0;</p> <p>Here is the background behind this inane, yet media-consuming, project.&#xa0;</p> <p>The US is coming up to its debt-ceiling limit soon.&#xa0;The debt ceiling is the amount the US Treasury<a href=\"http://bit.ly/10W5ZrD\"> is allowed to \u2013 and has already \u2013 spent</a>. Raising the debt ceiling means allowing the US Treasury to pay its bills; if the debt ceiling is not raised, the US will default on its financial commitments and put at risk its credibility as well as the health of the bond and stock markets. The US already went through a bruising debt-ceiling fight in 2011, which resulted in a downgrade. Members of Congress, mostly led by the hapless and disorganized Tea Party, are preparing to do exactly that: hold the debt-ceiling vote hostage and refuse to raise the debt ceiling until they get a giant package of spending cuts.&#xa0;</p> <p>This is a real problem, and in a couple of months \u2013 when we hit the debt ceiling \u2013 every American will be so sick of the insane discussion that we may all collectively vomit. But the fact remains: how to get out? What to do?&#xa0;</p> <p>A small but relentless group of impish bloggers and columnists \u2013 including Joe Weisenthal of Business Insider and Josh Barro of Bloomberg, as well as hapless Congressman Jerry Nadler \u2013 have created a large-scale trolling project that is meant to pressure the US Treasury into creating a trillion-dollar platinum coin to solve this problem. (The former head of the US mint, Philip Diehl,&#xa0;<a href=\"http://www.capitalnewyork.com/article/politics/2013/01/7071045/trillion-dollar-coin-idea-takes-and-former-head-us-mint-doesnt-see-\">says it is legal</a>,&#xa0;but legal, of course, doesn't mean something is a good idea. It just means no one in legislative circles anticipated this particular idiocy.)&#xa0;</p> <p>Their reasoning is this: the US Treasury has the <a href=\"http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/31/5112\">power to&#xa0;create platinum coins </a>of any size and denomination. It could easily print one with a face value of $1tn and deposit it at the Federal Reserve, thus immediately adding $1tn to the Treasury's bank account and giving it breathing room to avoid the debt ceiling fight.&#xa0;</p> <p>This is an elegant solution \u2013 if you are a cartoon villain given to sitting in a vast underground bunker and innovating plans for world domination while petting a white cat. It makes less sense for real mortals. In fact, it has all the aspects of&#xa0;a group of well-financed mad scientists plotting to create a giant slingshot to avert an asteroid hurtling towards the earth.</p> <p>The #mintthecoin project is not meant, of course, to be completely serious, although they may play at it on TV. In the minds of its creators, is supposed to be a kind of Swiftian Modest Proposal that highlights the ridiculousness of the recurring debt ceiling hostage-taking by offering an equally ridiculous solution.&#xa0;</p> <p>Even as satire, it does not work. Leave aside the strange hashtag and the stringy petition. Leave aside the somewhat science-fiction-like idea of a magic coin, as if the US economy is a video game. &#xa0;&#xa0;</p> <p>Here is one big problem: the US Treasury spends approximately $100bn per month. A trillion-dollar coin would buy the Treasury only about 10 months of breathing room. It is dubious at best that a Congress full of reckless legislators will surely come to their senses in only 10 months, given that they haven't for the past 18 months since the same last debacle. Delaying the Debt Ceiling Reunion Tour will not achieve the primary goal here, which is ending it.&#xa0;</p> <p>Another problem with the trillion-dollar coin is that the US mint probably doesn't have the capacity to create one out of real bullion, which will likely be required for something with such a historical importance. The US mint no longer produces platinum coins, except in collector's editions that retail for&#xa0;$1,892 at the moment. A real platinum coin \u2013 the American Eagle \u2013 that was produced as recently as 2009 contains 31.12 grams of platinum and has a face value of $100. There is not enough platinum in the US in a year's supply to create that. The US produces all of 3,700 kilograms of platinum a year.&#xa0;</p> <p>The mint could, on the direction of Treasury, just make a platinum-finished coin that bears the face value of $1tn, but that would just create a nonsensical level of inflation in the value of the US dollar.&#xa0;</p> <p>Another point, perhaps, is that it's no worse for the Treasury to print a trillion-dollar gold coin than it is for the Federal Reserve to buy trillions in mortgage securities to save banks and the bond market. There is more meat to this \u2013 the US government is not nearly done meddling in the world of the economy and the markets, and minting a new coin is very much in the interventionist mold of the past four years. But the Fed's programs don't require scouring the US reserves for platinum and creating some unnatural currency beast. It can at least masquerade as an intellectual exercise.&#xa0;</p> <p>The most insulting thing about the campaign to mint the trillion-dollar platinum coin is this: there are some \u2013 a few! \u2013 in the financial world who do not have the memory capacity of goldfish. Those people who can think as far back as 2011 remember that we went through the drill on the platinum coin back then \u2013 all the commentary, the punditry, the absurd speculation about it was first created at the time of the last debt-ceiling fight. Then, as now, it attracted the efforts of bored bloggers, chattering among themselves. And guess what? It didn't impress upon Congress the recklessness of their approach. The US came within hours of default anyway. If anything, we have a more unreasonable and humorless Congress, even less likely to be swayed by satire or ridicule. The platinum joke, played once last year, is played out now.&#xa0;</p> <p>But the biggest disadvantage of the platinum coin campaign is that it is frivolous, when there is a serious failure of US governance at stake. Allowing the \"mint the coin\" campaign to take over the news cycle may be good for the media exposure of the bloggers involved, but it does nothing to dissuade stubborn lawmakers from a silly path they chose once and are likely to choose again. </p> <p>A Congress like this doesn't need to be reminded of how ridiculous it is; it already knows that. It needs to be reminded of the nobility and dignity and importance of the offices they agreed to hold, and which they are now dragging through the mud.&#xa0;</p>",

Even as satire, it does not work. Leave aside the strange hashtag and the stringy petition. Leave aside the somewhat science-fiction-like idea of a magic coin, as if the US economy is a video game. Here is one big problem: the US Treasury spends approximately $100bn per month. A trillion-dollar coin would buy the Treasury only about 10 months of breathing room. It is dubious at best that a Congress full of reckless legislators will surely come to their senses in only 10 months, given that they haven't for the past 18 months since the same last debacle. Delaying the Debt Ceiling Reunion Tour will not achieve the primary goal here, which is ending it. Another problem with the trillion-dollar coin is that the US mint probably doesn't have the capacity to create one out of real bullion, which will likely be required for something with such a historical importance. The US mint no longer produces platinum coins, except in collector's editions that retail for $1,892 at the moment. A real platinum coin \u2013 the American Eagle \u2013 that was produced as recently as 2009 contains 31.12 grams of platinum and has a face value of $100. There is not enough platinum in the US in a year's supply to create that. The US produces all of 3,700 kilograms of platinum a year. The mint could, on the direction of Treasury, just make a platinum-finished coin that bears the face value of $1tn, but that would just create a nonsensical level of inflation in the value of the US dollar. Another point, perhaps, is that it's no worse for the Treasury to print a trillion-dollar gold coin than it is for the Federal Reserve to buy trillions in mortgage securities to save banks and the bond market. There is more meat to this \u2013 the US government is not nearly done meddling in the world of the economy and the markets, and minting a new coin is very much in the interventionist mold of the past four years. But the Fed's programs don't require scouring the US reserves for platinum and creating some unnatural currency beast. It can at least masquerade as an intellectual exercise. The most insulting thing about the campaign to mint the trillion-dollar platinum coin is this: there are some \u2013 a few! \u2013 in the financial world who do not have the memory capacity of goldfish. Those people who can think as far back as 2011 remember that we went through the drill on the platinum coin back then \u2013 all the commentary, the punditry, the absurd speculation about it was first created at the time of the last debt-ceiling fight. Then, as now, it attracted the efforts of bored bloggers, chattering among themselves. And guess what? It didn't impress upon Congress the recklessness of their approach. The US came within hours of default anyway. If anything, we have a more unreasonable and humorless Congress, even less likely to be swayed by satire or ridicule. The platinum joke, played once last year, is played out now. But the biggest disadvantage of the platinum coin campaign is that it is frivolous, when there is a serious failure of US governance at stake. Allowing the \"mint the coin\" campaign to take over the news cycle may be good for the media exposure of the bloggers involved, but it does nothing to dissuade stubborn lawmakers from a silly path they chose once and are likely to choose again. A Congress like this doesn't need to be reminded of how ridiculous it is; it already knows that. It needs to be reminded of the nobility and dignity and importance of the offices they agreed to hold, and which they are now dragging through the mud.",

      "bodyText": "It was an online Christmas, it seems. John Lewis says it conducted a quarter of its trade over the internet, a remarkable statistic even if it is inflated by the click and collect service. Next week we'll learn what happened to a retailer that (so far) has declined to play the online game. Morrisons, if the rumours are correct, had a shocker. Its like-for-like sales are estimated by the City to have fallen 2.5%. Strip out inflation and that implies volume \u2013 the quantity of stuff being shifted \u2013 is declining at about 5% a year. For a business with a huge fixed overhead in the form of 455 supermarkets, that's serious. Morrisons, almost certainly, will soon bow to the inevitable and name the date it will adopt its main rivals' online ways. But don't make the mistake of thinking this is a tale of an idiosyncratic shopkeeper being dragged into the 21st century. Morrisons' wariness about taking the online plunge is understandable. For traditional supermarkets the economics of online retailing look horrible. Sir Ken Morrison himself dismissed home delivery as something he had done \"on a bike as a young man\". The rule of thumb says it costs \u00a315 to \u00a320 to pick and deliver a customer's order. But nobody is consistently charging more than a fiver and the groceries themselves cost the same whether you turn up in person to wheel a trolley or have the goods delivered to your front door. Sir Ken was right: for the retailer life is much easier when the customer does the fiddly part. But his latest successor, chief executive Dalton Philips, would also be right to admit that the penalty for not playing by the new rules is now too great. The online grocery market is worth \u00a35bn and is growing at \u00a31bn a year \u2013 that's a big pie to refuse to fight for. Just don't expect the economics to get better for anybody. Investec's Dave McCarthy, who has been warning for ages that the supermarkets face a \"damned if they do, damned if they don't\" choice online, thinks industry conditions are the worst for 30 years. Even early internet-adopters such as Tesco and Sainsbury's, he estimates, are suffering 3%-5% volume declines in their traditional large stores. Managements, naturally, are keen to promote the idea that they haven't squandered capital and that, actually, a virtuous circle is developing. Tesco and Sainsbury's argue internet shoppers tend to be more loyal to the brand and spend more. Really? McCarthy is sceptical, asking why these supposedly perfect customers require so many discount vouchers and why Tesco and Sainsbury's are still suffering like-for-like declines in sales volumes. That \u00a35bn online market has not been created out of nothing. In the main, it's cannibalisation of sales from traditional stores. Profits, concludes McCarthy, may have peaked in 2010, which is what share prices suggest. Of course, the plot would change again if supermarkets could persuade online customers to pay, say, \u00a320 an order. But there's little chance of that in the current climate. It's all so much easier for non-food merchants, who are, in effect, re-creating catalogue retailing from the 1960s and 1970s but without the printing costs. For the ideal model, look no further than Next, whose 25-year-old Directory business has morphed into the slickest online operation in the land. Next's logistical skills are impressive but, against the supermarkets, the group starts with the advantage that clothes don't have been to be delivered in refrigerated vans. Chief executive Simon Wolfson is also ruthless in pruning high street stores whose profit margins are slipping: in macho supermarket-land, that's still alien thinking. On such details, retail empires shift. It's astonishing to report that the stock market value of little Next (\u00a36.2bn) is now within a whisker of that of grand old Sainsbury's (\u00a36.3bn) and is above Morrisons (\u00a36.0bn). Why are UK gilt yields rising? UK gilt yields are rising. On the 10-year, we passed 2% this week and we're now neck-and-neck with France, which a couple of months ago was being described by the Economist as the ticking time-bomb at the heart of Europe. Why are yields rising? Three possibilities: (a) It's the beginning of the end for George Osborne and the coalition government. Bond vigilantes are on the march and have rumbled a chancellor who can't meet Labour's pre-election debt-reduction targets, let alone his own. International investors will now demand a better return for the privilege of funding HM government's deficits. (b) It's a sign of a return of normality and should be welcomed. There's a whiff of growth in the air, at least by the end of 2013, and it's only natural for investors to imagine the day when the gilt market is not so distorted by bursts of quantitative easing. (c) It's too soon to say. Everybody should calm down and remember that a shift from 1.5% to 2.1% in the 10-year yield is hardly momentous. In any case, US Treasury yields are also rising. It may simply be that Mario Draghi at the European Central Bank, by making Italian and Spanish IOUs relatively safer, has dampened the panic buying of the supposedly \"safe haven\" sovereign debt of the US and UK. That's a good thing too. At the moment, factor (c) is probably uppermost, but (a) (especially) and (b) should not be dismissed. This plot is still developing \u2013 indeed, developing fast. Britain's triple-A rating may be soon be history and on 25 January we'll learn whether the UK is halfway into a triple-dip recession. The economists' consensus thinks so: a fall in fourth-quarter GDP is predicted and Friday'sservice sector data was bleak. A modest fall in GDP should not scare the market. But the reaction to a big decline \u2013 say 0.4% \u2013 is tricky to predict. Would investors question Britain's deficit-fighting capability or take the benign view (from Osborne's perspective) that interest rates will be low for longer and so gilt yields should fall again? Hard to say, but there's a lot else happening at the end of this month, such as the removal of child benefit from higher earners, a process that could be both chaotic and shift opinion polls just as investors start to think about the 2015 election. A \"perfect storm\", could be brewing, thinks Nick Parsons, strategist at National Australia Bank. Landfall, if it happens, is about three weeks away. Goldman workers need to lead from the front Nobody ever got to the top of Goldman Sachs without being able to spot a trading opportunity at 10 paces. No surprise, then, that the investment bank noted that the fiscal cliff drama could have implications for executives' bonuses \u2013 or, strictly speaking, restricted stock units earned in previous years but awaiting distribution. Pay them in January, as normal, and the bonuses could be subject to the (modestly) higher 2013 tax rate for big-earners that a cliff compromise was very likely to bring \u2013 and did. Hand out the shares on 31 December and the executives \u2013 10 individuals collecting $65m \u2013 would benefit from 2012 rates. It's not the most egregious piece of tax planning you'll see. But Goldman chief executive Lloyd Blankfein, one of the beneficiaries, has been banging on for ages about the need for rich Americans to accept higher taxes as part of the hoped-for US revival. The new year soft-shoe shuffle makes it look as if senior Goldmanites would prefer to lead from the back. Why couldn't they show self-restraint? They just can't help themselves.",

Wegelin, which was founded in 1741, said it would \"cease to operate as a bank\" after it admitted it had allowed 100 US taxpayers to hide their money.

It is the first foreign bank to close since the US authorities began a crackdown on those helping Americans dodge taxes. US authorities said Wegelin had wooed American clients fleeing Switzerland's biggest bank, UBS, after it admitted in 2008 to helping Americans evade tax, paid a $780m fine and handed over information on more than 4,450 accounts. US prosecutor Preet Bharara said Wegelin became a haven for US tax evaders by hiding their money in secret offshore accounts. Bharara, who was described as the man \"busting Wall Street\" on the cover of Time magazine, said Wegelin \"wilfully and aggressively jumped in to fill the void that was left when other Swiss banks abandoned the practice due to pressure from US law enforcement\". He said Wegelin's closure and guilty plea was a watershed moment in US efforts to crack down on individuals and banks \"engaging in unlawful conduct that deprives the US treasury of billions of dollars of tax revenue\". \"There is no excuse for wealthy Americans flouting their responsibilities as citizens of this great country to pay their taxes, and there is no excuse for foreign financial institutions helping them to do so,\" he said. It was alleged that Wegelin's scheme involved its bankers opening secret accounts for US clients under code names and setting up sham entities to avoid detection in various tax havens, including Panama and Liechtenstein. It is not yet known if the bank will be forced to hand over the names of US clients who held secret accounts at the bank. Until this week it had refused to appear in court to answer the charges, leading US district judge Jed Rakoff to declare it a fugitive from justice. In court papers, Bruderer said Wegelin \"believed it would not be prosecuted in the United States for this conduct because it had no branches or offices in the United States and because of its understanding that it acted in accordance with, and not in violation of, Swiss law and that such conduct was common in the Swiss banking industry\". Although Wegelin will cease to exist, the bank's partners sold its non-American client accounts to the Austrian bank Raiffeisen just before its indictment last January.

      "bodyText": "A shock fall in activity in Britain's services sector at the end of last year has put the economy on the road to a triple-dip recession, as economists predict the UK will be stripped of its triple-A credit rating. The services sector \u2013 which accounts for three-quarters of Britain's economic output \u2013 shrank for the first time in two years in December, suggesting the UK economy contracted in the fourth quarter. If output drops again over the next three months, the UK will fall into its third recession in five years \u2013 an unprecedented triple dip. Howard Archer of IHS Global Insight said: \"This is undeniably a very disappointing survey that fuels fears the economy suffered a renewed dip in GDP in the fourth quarter. Given the dominant role of the services sector and the fact that it has recently been the healthiest part of the UK economy on the output side, the reported fall in activity in December is a significant blow for growth hopes.\" The data came out as Citi released a report suggesting the UK economy will disappoint again this year and could lose its prized triple-A credit rating. Michael Saunders, economist at Citi, said Britain is likely to suffer from weak growth, inflation will stay stubbornly high, and the government will fail to make a substantial dent in the deficit. \"With the public debt/GDP ratio set to surge further in coming years, we think the UK will lose its AAA rating in 2013,\" he said. The closely watched CIPS/Markit purchasing managers index (PMI) for services dropped from 50.2 to 48.9 in December, below the 50 mark that separates expansion from contraction. It is the lowest reading since April 2009 and substantially undershot analyst forecasts of a rise to 50.5. The survey snuffed out the glimmer of hope offered by data released earlier this week that showed a surprise jump in factory activity in December. But manufacturing accounts for just 10% of the economy and that release was followed by a dreary set of figures from the construction industry, which shrank much faster than expected. Markit said overall the PMIs suggest the UK economy contracted by 0.2% in the last quarter of 2012. Chris Williamson of Markit said the weakness in services could continue into 2013. \"Bad weather is likely to have played a role in dampening service sector activity in December, but the fact that incoming new business dropped for a second successive month suggests that underlying demand remains very weak and that activity may continue to fall in the new year.\" Poor trading meant companies chose not to replace leaving employees, which led to a slight decline in staff numbers. Williamson said that means UK unemployment could soon start to rise again, as private sector lay-offs add to public sector job cuts. The news will reignite the debate over whether the Bank of England is likely to expand its quantitative easing (QE) programme to try to kickstart the economy. Archer said: \"While the weak services purchasing managers' survey is unlikely to prompt the Bank of England's monetary policy committee into taking any stimulative [action] at its January meeting next week, it does reinforce our belief that further QE is more likely than not over the coming months. For now though, the MPC is likely to sit tight given current increased inflation concerns and signs that the Funding for Lending Scheme could be having a beneficial impact.\" There was better news out of the US, where employers added 155,000 jobs in December, slightly ahead of expectations. But analysts said it was not enough to make a big difference to the unemployment rate.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "European markets have continued their January jump despite a mixed economic picture, with poor UK service sector data but positive jobs news from the US. The FTSE 100, having broken the 6000 barrier earlier in the week after the US fiscal cliff deal, rose another 42.50 points to end at 6089.84, its best level since February 2011. Joshua Raymond, chief market strategist at City Index, said: The UK index now faces a big test at the 6100 level, where strong resistance lays. With most traders returning to their desks next week after a long festive break, we should see heavier volumes return and therefore we will learn much more about market sentiment and whether the FTSE can overcome this obstacle. A close above 6100 by the end of next week will be a positive sign for both the FTSE 100 and blue chip UK stocks. The FTSE 100 has failed at this level on each of the previous four attempts and so another failure at 6100 could see investors start to bank their gains on masse after a rally from the lows of June 2012 and this could spark a price correction in London. But for now the mood is fairly positive, as it was in the rest of Europe: \u2022 Germany's Dax added 0.26% \u2022 France's Cac closed up 0.24% \u2022 Italy's FTSE MIB finished 0.3% higher \u2022 Spain's Ibex was up 0.39% \u2022 The Athens market added 1.25% In the US the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently 17 points or 0.13% better. And with that, it's time to close up for the day and indeed the week. Thanks for all your comments, have a good weekend, and we'll be back on Monday morning. One final thought, here's something to watch out for next week: Back with Greece, and Reuters is reporting that four of the country's banks have made offers for state-controlled Hellenic Postbank. Postbank is being split into a good and bad bank, and of course it is the former that is up for grabs. According to the report, Alpha Bank, Attica Bank, Eurobank and National Bank have all thrown their hat into the ring. Alpha Bank, for one, has just confirmed \"initial interest\" in Postbank. More positive economic data from the US. The ISM non-manufacturing index - a snapshot of the US services sector - rose to 56.1 in December, the highest since February. This is up from 54.7 in November and above expectations of a 54.2 reading. Here's some comments from respondents to the survey: \u2022\"Business conditions are picking up despite the current economic state and the federal budget issues.\" (Professional, Scientific and Technical Services) \u2022\"The holidays will slow construction some, but overall business remains about 25 percent ahead of last year. Weather has been favorable.\" (Wholesale Trade) \u2022\"Consumer optimism increased; lower gasoline prices lead to higher retail sales.\" (Public Administration) \u2022\"Business has picked up significantly during this last quarter of the year.\" (Transportation and Warehousing) Wall Street has opened lower despite the reassuring US jobs figures, and ahead of the latest service sector data. The Dow Jones Industrial Average has edged down around 8 points in early trading. And to honour Mark Carney, the Bank of Canada governor who is to take up the same post at the Bank of England, here's the latest employment data from his country. Canada added 39,000 jobs in December, well above expectations of a 5,000 rise, while the unemployment rate dropped from 7.2% to 7.1%. More reaction to the US jobs figures, from Rob Carnell at ING: The headline non-farm payrolls increase of 155,000 was within spitting distance of the consensus 152,000 expectation, though the market may have been hoping for an upside surprise given recent ADP figures in excess of 200,000. This employment report leaves expectations for future Fed policy broadly unchanged. That said, even at 7.8%, we believe that the unemployment rate may well threaten the Fed\u2019s 6.5% line in the sand earlier than mid-2015, which seems to be the Fed\u2019s own expectation. The US jobs market was steady in the run up to Christmas, with the number of non farming jobs up 155,000 in December. The growth was in line with the 150,000 forecast by a Reuters poll of economists. November's figures were revised up from a growth of 146,000 to 161,000, suggesting the job market recovery may be slowing. There were a total of 12.2m people out of work, according to the US Bureau of Labor Statistics, with the unemployment rate largely unchanged since September, still stubbornly above the 6.5% Federal Reserve target. Last month, the central bank said it would keep interest rates near zero until its unemployment target is met, and as long as inflation does not rise above 2.5%. Unemployment rates for women (7.3%) and blacks (14%) edged up in December, while rates for adult men (7.2%) teenagers (23.5%), whites (6.9%) and Hispanics (9.6%) showed little or no change. The number of long term unemployed was essentially unchanged at 4.8m and accounted for 39.1% of those out of work. Average hourly earnings for all non farm employees rose by 7 cents to $23.73, meaning over the year average hourly earnings rose by 2.1%. Justin Wolfers, economics professor at the University of Michigan, had this to say: James Pethokoukis at the American Enterprise Institute noted: And with that, I'm handing over to my colleague Nick Fletcher. The Guardian's economics editor Larry Elliott says today's service sector gloom points to a triple dip recession. His comment today concludes: Even after unprecedented policy measures, this is an economy that is going nowhere fast. The story of the year ahead will be weak growth, failure to meet government borrowing targets, credit downgrades and pressure on both the Bank and the Treasury to end what is comfortably the slowest and weakest recovery of the modern age. Read his piece in full here. The eurozone crisis has spawned yet another new word. Unlike Grexit, this one sounds as though it might be a genuine part of the lexicon. Santander, Spain's largest bank, is reportedly planning to cut 3,000 jobs following its merger with its Banesto subsidiary. The number came from union sources close to the bank cited by financial newspaper Cinco Dias. Santander will open talks with unions on 9 January, but has already warned of gradual but heavy job losses. The merger will see 110 year old Banesto bank fully absorbed into its parent, with the closure of 700 branches helping to cut costs. Nationalised lender Bankia will also begin talks with unions on 9 January over previously announced plans to shed 6,000 of its 20,000 strong workforce. Spanish unemployment its already at a record high of 25%. The UK will lose its first class credit rating in 2013, economists at Citi bank have declared following Friday's downbeat economic indicators. Citi has revised its growth forecast down to 0.4% from 0.8% for the year, well below the 1.1% consensus, and expects growth to stay weak in 2014, at only 0.5% to 1%. The bank's Michael Saunders predicted in a note: Even if the economy does not suffer a treble dip recession, we expect that real GDP will not regain its prerecession peak until 2016, with real GDP per head not regaining its prerecession peak even by the end of this decade. With the public debt/GDP ratio set to surge further in coming yeras, we think the uK will lose its AA rating in 2013. Saunders forecasts that the government debt to GDP ration will balloon to 95% by the end of 2013, up from 44% at the end of 2007, with no prospect of cuts big enough to redress the balance before the next general election. With the next election due no later than June 2015, and Labour ahead in the polls, there inevitably are doubts as to whether a new government would actually deliver post-2015 spending cuts unless constrained by market pressure. As a result, we have argued previously that the UK will probably lose its AAA rating in the next 12-18 months \u2014 indeed, with the weaker economic outlook, we now expect this downgrade will occur in 2013. Citi pushed back its forecast for the first UK interest rate hike from 2016 to mid-2017, a full 8 yeras after rates fell to half a percentage point in early 2009. Earlier Friday, Reuters reported that the UK's borrowing costs briefly overtook those of France, raising questions about how long the nation can retain its AAA credit rating. Borrowing costs for 10 year UK Gilts rose above France's in early morning trading, hitting an 8 month high of 2.132 at 8:39. The UK retains its first class credit score, but France was stripped of its AAA last year. Card transactions have been suspended within the Vatican City because of concerns about compliance with international banking regulations, including those concerning money laundering, the Guardian's Lizzy Davies reports from Rome. She writes: If there's one thing more annoying than queueing for hours for the Sistine Chapel, it's queueing for hours only to be told that the marvels of Michelangelo's ceiling are off limits unless you have cash in your wallet. Tourists and pilgrims flocking to the Vatican City since New Year's Day found that they had to pay for all purchases by cash or cheque after electronic transactions were suspended following concerns over the city state's compliance with international banking regulations, including those concerning money laundering. The move \u2013 which left the Holy See embarrassed and scrambling for a solution \u2013 affected customers at the Vatican's well-stocked pharmacy, as well as at its several shops and post office, and, most significantly, its museums \u2013 home to the Sistine Chapel and other masterpieces. A notice on the museums' website apologised for any inconvenience caused by the problem, which it blamed on \"reasons beyond [its] control\". Inflation in the Euro area is expected to be registered at 2.2% in December, marking no change on the month before, according to a flash estimate from the European Union. Energy inflation is forecast to have fallen to 5.2% compared with 5.7% in November, while at the other end of the scale services is running at 1.8%, up from 1.6% the month before, according to Eurostat, the EU's statistics office. Gizem Kara, European economist at BNP Paribas, comments: As the impact of indirect tax hikes and administered price rises falls out of the year-on-year comparison, we expect inflation to fall below 2% as early as end Q1. With labour-market conditions remaining weak and in turn weighing on household incomes, disinflationary, rather than inflationary, factors will dominate the inflation outlook in 2013. Howard Archer at IHS Global Insight says: There is nothing really alarming in the December eurozone inflation data and underlying inflationary pressures seemingly remain muted amid extended weakened economic activity and high and rising unemployment. Consequently, it still seems likely that eurozone consumer price inflation will move below 2.0% over the coming months. This will help consumers\u2019 purchasing power and facilitate further stimulative action by the ECB [European Central Bank]. It seems more likely than not that the ECB will hold off from trimming interest rates at its 10 January meeting, although we would not rule out a move. And we do expect the ECB to take interest rates down from 0.75% to 0.50% sometime during the first quarter. A downcast response to the slump in the UK services sector uncovered by Friday's PMI data. Brian Hilliard at Societe Generale: This is quite worrying. It does suggest that as we come to the turn of the year, the economy's been losing momentum, so it doesn't augur well for growth... I think [the data] will make it clear ot the Bank of England that they should consider more easing, but the point is in the short term at least it's coming in the form of the Funding for Lending Scheme and the data on that are quite encouraging I think. Rob Wood at Berenberg Bank: Future business expectations remain very weak and point to contraction in Q1 2013. This is a story of the first half, with the UK flat-lining. But as we head into the second half of the year, we still expect the UK to return to gradual grwoth, in part as credit conditions ease with the Funding for Lending Scheme. Fragile but stable is how I would describe the UK economy. Annalisa Piazza, Newedge Strategy: UK data were mixed this morning, confirming the idea that the UK economy is not out of the woods yet. The Services PMI index is now running at its lowest level since mid-09, when the UK economy was in a deep recession. As for the UK mortgage market, today's BoE's mortgage approvals data...is broadly in line with expectations and it marks the strongest reading since January 2012. European unemployment will pass the 20m mark in the second half of 2013, according to a study by auditors Ernst &amp; Young, up from 18.7m in October. Jobs will be cut to cope with a 0.2% decline in economic performance in European countries, which will follow the 0.4% slump recorded in 2012, according to Greek news site Capital.gr's report of the E&amp;Y study. Unemployment in Greece is forecast to reach 28% in 2013, and 27% in Spain. A risk of continuing contraction in Europe in the first quarter, according to IHS economist Howard Archer's analysis of the eurozone PMIs: Both the Eurozone services and, especially, manufacturing surveys are currently still in contraction territory. Indeed, although the composite output index for Eurozone services and manufacturing activity improved to a nine-month high of 47.2 in December from 46.5 in November and a 40-month low of 45.7 in October, it was still clearly below the 50.0 level that indicates flat activity. Consequently, it still seems that the Eurozone suffered a third successive quarter of modest GDP contraction in the fourth quarter of 2012. Furthermore, with incoming new business, backlogs of work and employment all still falling in December, there remains a very real risk that the Eurozone will continue to contract in the first quarter of 2013. The upside for domestic demand in the Eurozone is likely to remain constrained by tighter fiscal policy in many countries, high and rising unemployment, and limited consumer purchasing power. The main hope for the Eurozone is that there is a sustained easing of sovereign debt tensions following the November Greek debt agreement and the introduction of the European Central Bank\u2019s Outright Monetary Transactions programme and that this reduces uncertainty and lifts business confidence. Improving global growth would also help matters, and the Eurozone will obviously be relieved by the US avoiding falling over the \u201cfiscal cliff\u201d. The services sector may be in recession, but house buyers are still eager to spend. The Bank of England says the number of loan approvals for house purchases increased in November to 54,036, up from 53,071 the previous month, and was higher than the previous six month average of 49,206. A total of \u00a38.1 billion was borrowed to fund house purchases, up from \u00a37.8bn in October. The UK services sector suffered its first contraction in two years in December, suggesting the economy as a whole slipped back into recession in the last quarter of 2012. Markit's purchasing managers' index shows the service sector fell below the 50 mark which separates growth from contraction last month, registering 48.9, down from 50.2 in November and below the 50.5 that had been forecast. The service sector accounts for three quarters of the British productivity, and a decline in conditions has major repercussions for the economy. Markit economist Chris Williamson said: The first fall in service sector activity for two years raises the likelihood the the UK economy is sliding back into recession. The services PMI follows an equally disappointing construction survey for December, leaving manufacturing - which accounts for just 10% of the economy - as the only bright spot. Composite data from the three most recent months shows the UK posted its worst performance for three and a half years, and suggest the economy contracted by 0.2% in the fourth quarter. A mixed bag of service sector results for the eurozone, with Germany crossing the threshold into growth but the single currency block remaining in recession, just. The Markit survey of purchasing managers for the service sector shows the eurozone's largest economy surging above the 50 threshold which divides growth from contraction. Germany indexed 52.0, as forecast, an improvement on November's 49.7. The eurozone as a whole saw service sector conditions improve, indexing 47.8, up from 46.7 in November. The mood was upbeat in Spain and Italy, but deteriorated in France. Spain produced a better than expected index of 44.3, hitting a nine month high and beating a forecast 42.6 as well as the previous month's 42.4. Italy rose to 45.6 in December, up from 44.6 the month before. France fell to 45.2, down from 45.8 last month and lower than the forecast 46.0. Ireland edged down slightly but remained well above the 50 mark which separates contraction from growth, posting 55.8 in December compared to 56.1 in November. Eurozone inflation could continue to fall, price data released today suggests. The Eurozone Future Inflation Guage, which predicts cyclical trends, held at 92.2 in November, while similar indexes fell in Germany but rose in Italy and Spain, and left France unchanged. The Eurozone Consumer Price Index should give a better indication later today. 8:45 December services PMIs for Italy, France adn Germany 9:00 December Eurozpne Services PMI 9:30 UK December Services PMI 9:30 UK Net Consumer Credit for November UK net lending on dwellings for November plus mortgage approvals for November 10:00 Eurozone CPI estimate for December 13:30 US nonfarm payrolls for December, plus manufacturing and private payrolls and average hourly earnings 15:00 US factory orders for December Good morning, and welcome to our coverage of the key events in the global economic crisis. Central bankers in the United States are divided over how long to extend the current round of quantitative (QE) easing, according to minutes from their December meeting published Thursday. The split caused US markets to slide back as investors pondered the impact of a possible end to QE as early as December 2013, and London shares have begun the day with a 0.14% dip to 6038. The US began a third round of buying long term treasury and mortgage backed securities to stimulate economic recovery and drive down interest rates in September last year. Minutes from the rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee show that a \"few\" of the 12 voting members want to continue QE3 until the end of 2013. A \"few\" more want \"considerable accommodation\" with no set date. However, \"several\" other members want \"to slow or stop purchases well before the end of 2013\" and one member entirely opposes the programme. A few tends to mean two or three members, whereas several could be four or five, according to the Financial Times' analysis. Positive US jobs data - the non-farm payroll numbers for workers outside of the agricultural sector are due out later today - following on from yesterday's better than expected ADP employment numbers, could put pressure on the Fed to ease up on the quantitative easing, says CMC Markets analyst Michael Hewson: When put in the context of the recent improvements seen in the ADP numbers in recent months, and yesterday\u2019s strong numbers in particular, if today\u2019s non-farm payrolls numbers prove to be similarly strong and the unemployment rate continues to fall then we could well see the Fed step back sooner rather than later",

Indeed, although the composite output index for Eurozone services and manufacturing activity improved to a nine-month high of 47.2 in December from 46.5 in November and a 40-month low of 45.7 in October, it was still clearly below the 50.0 level that indicates flat activity. Consequently, it still seems that the Eurozone suffered a third successive quarter of modest GDP contraction in the fourth quarter of 2012. </p> <p>Furthermore, with incoming new business, backlogs of work and employment all still falling in December, there remains a very real risk that the Eurozone will continue to contract in the first quarter of 2013. The upside for domestic demand in the Eurozone is likely to remain constrained by tighter fiscal policy in many countries, high and rising unemployment, and limited consumer purchasing power.</p> <p>The main hope for the Eurozone is that there is a sustained easing of sovereign debt tensions following the November Greek debt agreement and the introduction of&#xa0;the European Central Bank\u2019s Outright Monetary Transactions programme and that this reduces uncertainty and lifts business confidence.
