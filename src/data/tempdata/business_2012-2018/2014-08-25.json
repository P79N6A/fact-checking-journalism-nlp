      "bodyText": "The pace of growth in the service sector has cooled over the summer, suggesting momentum in the overall economy could ease in the second half of the year. Consumer-focused firms such as hotels, bars and travel firms experienced their weakest expansion in a year, according to the CBI, with a balance of 25% more firms saying activity was up on last month compared with those recording a fall. Business and professional services such as accountancy, law and marketing grew at the slowest pace since November. But the CBI emphasised the mood of optimism in the overall sector, which accounts for about 78% of the economy, pointing out that lawyers, accountants and marketing specialists were being hired in the greatest numbers since before the financial crisis. In its latest snapshot of the UK services sector, the business lobby group reported that business and professional service firms are feeling more confident about the economy, although almost half are concerned that skills shortages will cramp their expansion plans in the year ahead. According to the CBI's survey of 215 firms, 44% of professional services firms said head count was up on the previous three months, while 11% said it was down. The 33% positive balance means that employment has been growing at its fastest pace since November 2007. These employers said they expect hiring to accelerate during the next quarter, putting expectations for employment growth at 46%, the highest since 1998 when the survey began. But 45% of these firms fear that shortages of professional staff will limit their expansion in the year ahead. Consumer-focused businesses were also upbeat about the economic climate, with 48% saying they were more optimistic than three months ago and only 4% less optimistic. A net total of 12% expect employment to go up in the next quarter. These firms also reported plans for record spending on their businesses: a net total of 16% expect to invest in land or buildings, the highest since 2010; while spending on vehicles and machinery is set to be at a record high - 29% of consumer firms have investment plans in this area. A total of 43% of firms in consumer-facing industries said business was better than three months ago, while 17% reported that takings were down. The resulting 25% balance is well above average, but the slowest point of growth since August 2013. Katja Hall, CBI deputy director general, said: \"The slowing in the pace of growth and profits in the service sector reflects our view that momentum in the economy will ease in the second half of the year. \"Employing more staff and planning to increase investment are positive steps in the quest for sustainable growth. However, skills shortages mean it is increasingly hard for firms to find and hire the right people. It's important that business and government address this issue together, to put the economy of the future on the right footing.\" The latest service sector survey comes after manufacturers reported that wages are rising faster than any other part of the economy. The engineering and manufacturing employers' association EEF reported that pay rose by 2.6% on last year at a time when wage growth has been at a near standstill. At the weekend the Bank of England deputy governor Ben Broadbent said UK workers may not see growth in their pay packets any any time soon.",

      "bodyText": "Hold the bruschetta: olive oil prices are expected to rise sharply after a prolonged drought in the world's biggest producing region in southern Spain, at the same time as a blight has hit the crop in Puglia, Italy's main olive-growing area. While there is still time for rain to save the day in Andalusia, as harvesting takes place from October to January depending on the olive variety and location, without better weather soon this year's crop is predicted to be 40% down on the bumper 1.77 million-tonne harvest of 2013-14. \"Not even the most optimistic are predicting a million tonnes,\" said David Erice of Spain's Small Farmers Union. \"We're expecting something closer to 2012, when production was around 700,000 tonnes.\" Spain produces 50% of the world's olive oil, with 73% of that coming from the province of Andalusia in the south and 16% from Catalonia in the north-east. In 2013 olive oil exports from Andalusia were worth \u20ac1.5bn (\u00a31.1bn). The drought isn't the only problem. Bumper harvests leave the trees exhausted, said Erice, and they produce far fewer olives the following year. Anticipation of a poor harvest means that in the wholesale market, where it is priced per kg, virgin olive oil has already risen from \u20ac2.40 to \u20ac2.70 per kg over the past few weeks, according to Infaoliva, the Spanish olive oil federation. The drought in 2012 led to a 13% price rise. Prices are predicted to rise by as much as \u20ac0.50c a litre \u2013 although extra virgin olive oil retails in supermarkets at around \u20ac3.00 a litre in Spain and is a popular loss leader in supermarket wars, to the detriment of producers who in recent years have complained that supermarkets have pushed the price down to below the cost of production. Some analysts predict that supermarkets will absorb any price hike in order to maintain their competitive edge. Virgin olive oil futures for September are at their highest level since June 2013, and some suppliers say that speculators are contributing to the rise in futures prices by capitalising on the uncertainty caused by the drought. The bets they are making are driving prices higher. There are also claims that some producers are withholding stock in anticipation of selling at a higher price later in the year. However, for all but the biggest producers the olive oil business has become a no-win proposition. If the harvest is good, the price slumps; a poor harvest means selling much less for only slightly more. The oil is exported principally to France, Portugal and Italy. Italy often repackages Spanish oil as \"estate bottled\", giving consumers the impression that it is an Italian product. Italy is the second largest producer after Spain, accounting for 15% of world production, with Greece producing 13%. This year Spain has overtaken Italy as the market leader in olive oil in the US and Japan. Worldwide demand for \"liquid gold\" has risen by 60% over the past 20 years, driven by increased demand in China, the US, Canada and Australia. Olive oil has been left off the list of agricultural products embargoed by Russia in its ongoing spat with the European Union. \"If Russia had included it in the list of banned products it would have been a great setback,\" says Rafael Pic\u00f3 of Asoliva, the oil exporters' association. While it is drought that threatens the Spanish harvest, in the southern Italian olive-growing region of Puglia the trees have been afflicted by the bacteria Xylella fastidiosa. \"There is no cure. The only solution is to burn the infected trees to stop the bacteria spreading quickly,\" Raffaele Piano, a local grower, said. \"Prices will rise by 30% to 40% but quality will not be affected,\" he said. While harvests in other major producing countries such as Greece and Turkey are expected to be at average levels this year, they will not be able to make up for the shortfall in Spanish production, and price rises seem inevitable.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "As members of the Co-Operative Group prepare to vote on sweeping changes to the way the troubled chain of supermarkets, chemists and funeral homes is managed, they have already been warned that the proposed shakeup may not go far enough. In an attempt to turn the corner after a disastrous period when the Co-op slumped to its biggest ever loss of \u00a32.5bn, members are being asked to vote on Saturday on a radical new structure that will ensure the board has a majority of independent members. The proposals unveiled earlier this month would cut the size of the Co-op board from 18 members to 11, with an independent chair and five independent non-executives. Overseeing the board would be a council of 100 members, to act as a guardian of the group's values, while a senate would act as go-between to help all sides work together. But in a watering down of recommendations from city veteran Lord Myners, three democratically elected members would remain on the board. Myners, a former Labour City minister, who was brought in to overhaul governance, wanted the board to be purged of all elected members. He argued that the current crop of elected directors \u2013 which includes a plasterer and a university lecturer \u2013 lack business experience and failed to stop the group embarking on some \"breathtakingly value-destructive\" deals, such as the takeover of the Somerfield supermarket chain and the Britannia building society. In other respects, the Co-op plan mostly follows Lord Myners's recommendations, and he has described the Co-op proposals as \"significant progress\". Oliver Parry, corporate governance adviser at the Institute of Directors, said the proposals were a step in the right direction but that the Co-op would still have \"a convoluted structure\" that would not meet the standards expected of a plc. Parry said: \"We have to understand that the Co-op is a mutual, so it is a slightly different beast to other organisations. But the one area of concern is the fact that three of members will be elected by other members, so it is not an entirely independent board. \"For us, from a governance perspective, without that thorough independence once has to ask how much independent oversight they can actually exercise.\" Co-op members will vote on the proposals on Saturday 30 August, with the result expected to be announced on the same day. Nearly four-fifths of the votes are held by Co-op members, represented by seven regional boards. The remaining 21% of the vote is held by 127 independent societies. The Co-op's members voted in favour of the broad outline of reform in May, but this is the first time they will get a say on the detailed plans, which the Co-op's management hopes will end the group's rescue phase. The Co-op Group, which now employs 87,000 people since losing majority control of the Co-op bank to hedge funds, is due to publish half-year results on 4 September. Simon Burke, a non-executive director at the Co-op, who is bidding to join the new board, told the Guardian earlier this month it was important to keep democratically elected members to make sure the Co-op's values \"translate through in how it does business\". Ursula Lidbetter, the Co-op's chair, has stressed that only people with \"business acumen and commitment to cooperative values and principles\" would be chosen to serve on the board. Parry said \"it's wait and see\" whether this would be the case. \"The Co-op has obviously got to learn from their mistakes of the past and what we have said to members is that they have to look very, very closely at the proposals and decide is that going to do enough to avoid the kind of difficulties that the Co-op have faced in the past.\" Co-operative Group: a timeline 2000 Co-operative Wholesale Society merges with Co-operative Retail Services, and the Co-operative Group is created. A group structure is agreed. 2007 Co-op Group merges with its biggest cooperative rival, United Co-operative. United's ambitious boss, Peter Marks, becomes chief executive of the new merged organisation. 2009 Co-op pays \u00a31.6bn to take over supermarket chain Somerfield. The Co-operative Bank and Britannia building society agree a merger, under Neville Richardson. July 2011 Richardson quits with \u00a34.6m, following a restructuring that sheds 670 financial adviser jobs. Barry Tootell takes over. August 2011 Co-op announces a bid for 632 Lloyds branches, Project Verde. December 2011 Lloyds board approves the Co-op bid. Privately, City regulator warns Lloyds that Co-op lacks the reserves to underwrite the deal. March 2013 Co-op Bank blames Britannia for a \u00a3257m loss in 2012. Co-op's insurance and asset management businesses are lined up for sale. April 2013 Co-op withdraws offer for Lloyds branches, blaming the economy and \"regulatory requirements\". May 2013 Moody's downgrades bank's credit rating to junk and Tootell resigns. B&amp;Q boss Euan Sutherland takes over as Co-op chief executive. A \u00a31.5bn black hole is found in the Co-op Bank's reserves. June 2013 The Rev Paul Flowers steps down as chairman of the Co-op Bank. October 2013 Co-op hands bondholders control of the bank to seal a rescue. Co-op left with 30% stake. 6 November 2013 Flowers shows limited grasp of the banking business under questioning by Treasury select committee about failure of the Lloyds deal. 17 November 2013 The Mail on Sunday publishes a video showing Flowers arranging to buy drugs. 12 December 2013 Co-op hires former City minister Lord Myners to review its operations for \u00a31 salary. 11 March 2014 Sutherland resigns after his \u00a36.6m pay deal is leaked to the Observer. He brands Co-op \"ungovernable\". 14 March 2014 Myners warns that Co-op could go bust unless it urgently reforms board and voting structure. He outlines a plan to replace multi-layered hierarchy with a plc-type board, and denounces \"bullying\" tactics from Co-Op activists. 24 March 2014 Co-op Bank reveals losses for 2013 could be as high as \u00a31.3bn. 7 April 2014 Co-op Bank delays full-year financial results until 11 April. 9 April 2014 Myners quits over increasing opposition to his plans. He will, however, complete his review. 7 May 2014 Flowers pleads guilty to drugs possession charges and is ordered to pay \u00a3525. 8 May 2014 Co-op Group's stake in Co-op bank falls to around 20%, as the bank turns to investors to raise \u00a3400m fresh capital. 17 May 2014 Co-op Group members vote unanimously to accept an overhaul of the 150-year old organisation, although a further vote on the exact detail of the changes must be held at the end of the summer. 22 August 2014 Co-op Bank announces half-year losses of \u00a375.8m and says it will face further losses this year and next. \u2022 This article was amended on 29 August 2014. An earlier version said: \"The biggest electors, with four-fifths of the vote, are seven regional cooperatives, of which Midcounties and Midlands are the largest. The remaining 21% of the vote is held by 127 independent societies.\" In fact nearly four-fifths of the vote is held by Co-op members, represented by seven regional boards; the Midlands Co-op merged with the Anglia Co-op to form the Central England Co-op last year; and the Midcounties and Central England are two of the 127 independent societies. The article also previously said that the current crop of elected directors of the Co-operative Group includes a nurse; in fact the nurse in question, Steven Bayes, lost his place on the board in April.",

Myners, a former Labour City minister, who was brought in to overhaul governance, wanted the board to be purged of all elected members. He argued that the current crop of elected directors \u2013 which includes a plasterer and a university lecturer \u2013 lack business experience and failed to stop the group embarking on <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/mar/14/extent-co-op-shambles-laid-bare-by-lord-myners\" title=\"\">some \"breathtakingly value-destructive\" deals</a>, such as the takeover of the Somerfield supermarket chain and the Britannia building society.</p> <p>In other respects, the Co-op plan mostly follows Lord Myners's recommendations, and he has described the Co-op proposals as \"significant progress\".</p> <p>Oliver Parry, corporate governance adviser at the Institute of Directors, said the proposals were a step in the right direction but that the Co-op would still have \"a convoluted structure\" that would not meet the standards expected of a plc.</p> <p>Parry said: \"We have to understand that the Co-op is a mutual, so it is a slightly different beast to other organisations. But the one area of concern is the fact that three of members will be elected by other members, so it is not an entirely independent board.</p> <p>\"For us, from a governance perspective, without that thorough independence once has to ask how much independent oversight they can actually exercise.\"</p> <p>Co-op members will vote on the proposals on Saturday 30 August, with the result expected to be announced on the same day. Nearly four-fifths of the votes are held by Co-op members, represented by seven regional boards.</p> <p>The remaining 21% of the vote is held by 127 independent societies.</p> <p>The Co-op's members voted in favour of the broad outline of reform in May, but this is the first time they will get a say on the detailed plans, which the Co-op's management hopes will end the group's rescue phase.

Ursula Lidbetter, the Co-op's chair, has stressed that only people with \"business acumen and commitment to cooperative values and principles\" would be chosen to serve on the board.</p> <p>Parry said \"it's wait and see\" whether this would be the case. \"The Co-op has obviously got to learn from their mistakes of the past and what we have said to members is that they have to look very, very closely at the proposals and decide is that going to do enough to avoid the kind of difficulties that the Co-op have faced in the past.\"</p> <h2>Co-operative Group: a timeline</h2> <p><strong>2000</strong> Co-operative Wholesale Society merges with Co-operative Retail Services, and the Co-operative Group is created.

      "bodyText": "The multibillion-dollar consolidation of the global pharmaceutical sector has seen another blockbuster deal after Switzerland's Roche agreed to buy US biotech company InterMune for $8.3bn (\u00a35bn). Roche, which makes influenza drug Tamiflu, said the deal would \"allow Roche to broaden and strengthen its respiratory portfolio globally\". California-based InterMune focuses its work on the deadly lung disease idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. Firms that make products for treating rare or incurable conditions, dubbed orphan drugs, have become a target for big drugmakers because the drugs are highly profitable. The pharmaceutical industry has seen escalating merger and acquisition activity this year, with FTSE 100-listed Shire agreeing to a \u00a332bn takeover by AbbVie of the US and Britain's GlaxoSmithKline engaging in a multibillion-pound asset swap with Novartis. US group Pfizer attempted to buy the UK's second largest drugs firm, AstraZeneca, in a \u00a369bn deal that foundered in the face of political pressure and AstraZeneca's refusal to do a deal. So far this year deals worth $260bn have been arranged in the pharmaceutical, biotech and medical product sectors, according to figures from Mergermarket.",
