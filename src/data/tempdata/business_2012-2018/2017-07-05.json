      "bodyText": "Carolyn McCall, the chief executive of easyJet, has emerged as the leading candidate to be the new chief executive of ITV. McCall, who is understood to have been interviewed for the role, is considered to be one of the strongest candidates on ITV\u2019s shortlist and if she is successful she would become Britain\u2019s most powerful female TV executive. The broadcaster is understood to have settled on its preferred candidate to take over from Adam Crozier, who left at the end of last month after seven years in charge. ITV could announce Crozier\u2019s successor as soon as this week with the broadcaster\u2019s interim results later this month viewed as the latest it is likely to wait. One source said that ITV has been seeking to \u201cpersuade\u201d McCall to take the role, as ITV faces headwinds including tough TV advertising conditions faced by all broadcasters as the business climate deteriorates. \u201cThe board has a well developed succession plan in place and is in the process of finding a successor,\u201d said a spokesman for ITV. McCall is part of a shortlist thought to include Paul Geddes, the chief executive of insurance company Direct Line, and Rob Woodward, the outgoing chief executive of STV, which holds the ITV broadcast franchises for Scotland. It is not clear if Geddes, who was appointed to the board of Channel 4 as a non-executive director last year, who has been considered a strong candidate is still in the running. The hunt for Crozier\u2019s successor is being led by ITV chairman Sir Peter Bazalgette, the former creative chief and chairman of Big Brother maker Endemol, who took over from Archie Norman last May. Bazalgette, who started a \u201csuccession planning\u201d exercise at the end of last year and the formal hunt for Crozier\u2019s replacement in May, is understood to have wanted a candidate with solid experience at a publicly listed company. Such a move would boost investor confidence as Bazalgette has no experience in chairing a listed business. Last month, Channel 4 appointed Alex Mahon, the former boss of the maker of MasterChef and Broadchurch, who went on to run the special effects firm behind Hollywood blockbusters including Gravity and Guardians of the Galaxy, as its chief executive. Mahon\u2019s appointment made her the first woman to run a UK broadcaster larger than Channel 5, and the first female Channel 4 chief executive in the broadcaster\u2019s 35-year history. Since joining easyJet in 2010, McCall has turned the airline into one of Europe\u2019s best-performing airlines. She was previously the chief executive of Guardian Media Group, the owner of the Guardian and Observer newspapers. McCall comes with a strong background in media sales. She came up through the commercial ranks at the Guardian after joining in 1986, and her listed company experience will help balance Bazalgette\u2019s lack of plc experience. She was appointed a dame for services to the aviation industry last year. In November, easyJet revealed a sharp fall in annual pre-tax profits \u2013 its first decline in six years \u2013 and expects a further drop this year after the budget airline was hit by the weak pound and was forced to cut prices. McCall said the company\u2019s performance had been \u201cresilient\u201d, after profits fell 27.9% to \u00a3495m. Since then easyJet\u2019s share price, which had fallen steeply, has recovered almost 30%. ITV is likely to be able to match McCall\u2019s pay expectations, Crozier earned about \u00a327m during his almost seven years running the company. Crozier, 53, left the broadcaster at the end of June and said he does not intend to take on another chief executive role, but to build up a portfolio of positions. ITV has put in place an interim measure in which Bazalgette will take the temporary role of executive chairman. Finance director Ian Griffiths will run the company as chief operating officer until Crozier\u2019s replacement starts. Griffiths is highly rated by the City but is not thought to have applied for the top job. When ITV announced Crozier\u2019s departure at the beginning of May, Bazalgette said the company had a \u201cwell-developed succession plan\u201d in place. The chairman was questioned by investors at ITV\u2019s annual meeting later that month and said: \u201cNothing has gone wrong, we are in a good place.\u201d",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Theresa May raised the spectre of a Greek-style economic collapse if Britain fails to press ahead with tackling the deficit on Wednesday, as she was challenged repeatedly by Jeremy Corbyn over the public sector pay cap. With intense political pressure on the prime minister \u2013 including from her own cabinet colleagues \u2013 to ease the strain for cash-strapped public servants, including nurses and teachers, she warned MPs about the risks of loosening the purse strings. \u201cThis is not a theoretical issue. Let us look at those countries that failed to deal with it. In Greece, where they have not dealt with the deficit ... What did we see with that failure to deal with the deficit? Spending on the health service cut by 36%. That does not help nurses or patients,\u201d she said. Comparisons with Greece were repeatedly used by George Osborne in 2010 to justify public spending cuts, as riots erupted on the streets of Athens over the stringent bailout conditions imposed by the International Monetary Fund and the eurozone. But the analogy represented a significant ratcheting up of the pro-austerity argument from May. A Conservative spokesman emphasised remarks afterwards, saying: \u201cThere are siren calls from Labour to abandon any kind of fiscal restraint whatsoever. What happens, we\u2019ve seen as a case study, is what happened in Greece.\u201d He added: \u201cI think she was suggesting if Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s Labour party got the chance to impose its fiscal policies on the United Kingdom that is a very real threat.\u201d A spokesman for Corbyn described the claims as \u201cpreposterous\u201d. \u201cThe situation in Greece is tied up with the eurozone and the management of the eurozone banks \u2013 we\u2019re not remotely in that situation. Our manifesto and our pledges were costed, unlike the government\u2019s,\u201d he said. Many Conservative MPs have returned to Westminster after the bruising election campaign, determined to urge the government to allay some of the concerns about spending cuts they heard from voters \u2013 including on school funding, as well as public sector pay. Some would like to see May give a clear signal before parliament breaks up for the summer recess on 20 July that the 1% across-the-board cap will be lifted. The chief secretary to the Treasury, Liz Truss, must write a letter to the independent pay review bodies shortly, setting out their remit and would be expected to reinforce the 1% cap. The Labour leader used all his questions to the prime minister at their weekly head to head to pressure her over issues of pay, accusing her of presiding over \u201ca low-pay epidemic\u201d in the UK, and claiming she had presided over \u201ca week of flip-flopping and floundering\u201d. May outlined the process by which a series of pay review bodies recommend rises for NHS staff, teachers and others, and said the government would \u201cconsider those reports very carefully\u201d. But she added: \u201cWe will always recognise the need to makes those decisions against the need to live within our means.\u201d Both she and Corbyn valued the contribution of public sector workers, May said but added: \u201cThe difference is, I know we have to pay for them.\u201d Several other ministers and aides went on to echo the comparison with Greece in a sign there is a concerted effort by the Conservatives to stress their desire for \u201csound money\u201d and attack Labour on the issue of economic competence. Truss said the cap on public sector pay was the \u201cresponsible thing to do\u201d in response to an urgent question from Labour. Philip Hammond, who has admitted that he would have liked the economy to play a more central role in the election campaign, has resisted pressure to ease up on austerity, warning his cabinet colleagues that money to fund extra spending pledges would have to come from cuts elsewhere or tax increases. One suggestion is that the Treasury could cancel planned tax cuts, including to the rate of corporation tax, as the Labour manifesto mooted. At 19%, the tax is already one of the lowest among major economies, but it is due to be reduced further, to 17%, in a move introduced by Osborne. A thinktank, the Institute for Fiscal Studies, calculates that scrapping the public sector pay cap altogether, as Labour would like to do, would cost government departments and local government \u00a36.3bn per year compared with the government\u2019s plans \u2013 increasing to \u00a39.2bn per year by 2021\u201322. Corbyn will give a speech to the British Chambers of Commerce on Thursday, calling for economic reform \u2013 including a greater role for the state in developing and promoting new technologies, to prevent another \u201clost decade\u201d of weak growth. He will argue that technological development, \u201ccan\u2019t be left to the market\u201d. \u201cTechnological change, from automation to decarbonisation, means that many jobs and industries will disappear or shrink in the coming years and decades. But I am not one of the doom-mongers, who believe that will inevitably herald an era of mass unemployment. \u201cAt every stage of economic and industrial history, jobs, industries and skills have been lost, replaced and transformed. But whether that happens at huge social cost, as it did, for example, in the early days of the Industrial Revolution and the Luddites, or is embraced and benefits everybody, depends on managing and planning for technological change. We can\u2019t simply leave it to the market.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Worldpay, which handles 40% of all card payments at tills in Britain, has agreed to a \u00a37.7bn potential takeover by US rival Vantiv in a move that has rekindled the debate about foreign takeovers. The cash-and-shares offer makes Worldpay the latest British company to be snapped up by a foreign buyer after the Brexit vote, which triggered a sharp fall in the value of the pound. Cambridge-based Arm Holdings was bought by Japan\u2019s SoftBank for \u00a324bn last July, and other deals include the engineering group WS Atkins, which was bought by Canada\u2019s SNC-Lavalin for \u00a32.1bn in April. The Worldpay deal was announced after intense talks through Tuesday night following its admission that it had been approached by Vantiv and JP Morgan Chase, driving its shares up 28%. On Wednesday, after Worldpay said it had agreed terms about a \u201cpossible offer\u201d with Vantiv, JP Morgan pulled out and Worldpay\u2019s shares ended 8% lower at 372p \u2013 the biggest fallers in the FTSE 100. Sir Vince Cable, running to be leader of the Liberal Democrats and former business secretary, tweeted: \u201cAnother top British company #Worldpay at risk following #Arm. Cheap pickings after #Brexit vote devaluation. Need reform #TAKEOVER rule.\u201d \u201cFrom a British perspective, it\u2019s a shame to see another ground-breaking UK tech company selling out to overseas competition, perhaps before reaching full potential on its own,\u201d said Jasper Lawler, head of research at financial firm London Capital Group. The payments sector is experiencing a period of rapid growth, as more people shift from cash to paying by card and online, which is sparking takeovers. Over the weekend, Nets, the Danish payments services company, said it had been approached by potential suitors. The rise of contactless cards has further accelerated the trend, becoming a popular payment method for lower-value transactions that were traditionally dominated by cash. Figures from the British Retail Consortium show that cash was used for less than half of all UK retail transactions for the first time in 2015. Worldpay has been listed on the stock market since 2015 and if the deal goes ahead, its shares will be delisted and the combined group will continue with Vantiv\u2019s listing in New York. Worldpay shareholders would own about 41% of the new group. The value of the deal varies with Vantiv\u2019s share price but when it was announced it valued Worldpay shares at 385p each, including a 5p dividend. This is a 19% premium on their value on Monday, the day before the British company confirmed the approaches. The premium is lower than that offered in recent deals, such as the 40% offered for Arm. \u201cIt looks like it\u2019s smaller than the market was expecting,\u201d said Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown. Details of the cost savings that might be achieved were not announced, but Worldpay said: \u201cThe boards of Worldpay and Vantiv see a compelling strategic, commercial and financial rationale for combining Worldpay and Vantiv\u2019s complementary businesses. \u201cThe potential merger creates a scale world-class payments group in a dynamic market \u2026 It will serve a wide range of customers, with a strong position in the four core regions of the US, Europe, Asia-Pacific and South America.\u201d It is thought Worldpay and Vantiv could operate from dual headquarters in London and Cincinnati, where the companies are respectively based. While there is little overlap between the two businesses in Britain and Europe, there is a greater crossover in the US. \u201cThe boards of Worldpay and Vantiv have identified substantial opportunities for cost synergies, which support significant potential shareholder value creation,\u201d Worldpay said. It was unclear on Wednesday whether a deal would result in job losses at the combined group, or how it might affect Worldpay\u2019s various British offices. The company has 5,000 staff in London, Manchester, Cambridge and Gateshead. Vantiv will dominate the board with seven members, including Charles Drucker as executive chairman and co-chief executive. Four Worldpay directors will join the board of the new group, including Philip Jansen as co-chief executive and Sir Michael Rake, BT chairman and former Barclays deputy chairman, in a non-executive role. Launched in 1989, Worldpay provides the technology that allows retailers and other business to accept card payments and online or mobile transactions. It was previously owned by Royal Bank of Scotland, which sold the business in 2010 to private equity firms Advent and Bain Capital as part of the terms of the bank\u2019s 2008 taxpayer bailout.",

One Swedish carmaker starting down the road to a zero emissions future will not solve global warming alone. But the whole automotive industry following suit would begin to make a serious difference in reducing oil demand and emissions. Transportation accounts for 14% of global greenhouse gas emissions and, as the US Environmental Protection Agency notes, almost all of the energy \u2013 95% \u2013 powering those cars, planes, trains and ships still comes from petrol and diesel. Electric cars show a route off that dependence, but their take-up has repeatedly disappointed. Barack Obama predicted 1m such car models in the US by 2015 \u2013 the actual number was 280,000. There are now 2m globally, out of more than 1bn cars in total, showing the mountain that still needs to be climbed. Bloomberg predicts 41m electric car sales a year in 2040, while BP this year revised its prediction upwards by 43m to a total of 100m on the roads by 2035. Renault-Nissan has arguably led the way in 100% electric cars so far, with 350,000 sold in total. VW, looking to clean up its image after the diesel scandal, plans to sell 1m electric cars a year by 2025. Volvo\u2019s target is to sell 1m electric vehicles \u2013 that includes plug-ins and hybrids as well as pure battery-powered cars \u2013 by 2025. The company\u2019s chief executive said he had changed his view from two years ago, when he suggested pure electric cars were not ready for primetime, because things had changed faster than expected. \u201cI think things have changed, and you can change your mind as well. We were sceptic[al] about the cost level of batteries and the lack of infrastructure to charge all-electric cars,\u201d H\u00e5kan Samuelsson told a press conference in Stockholm. \u201cThings have moved faster. Customer demand is increasing. Battery costs have come down. There is also movement now on the charging infrastructure,\u201d he said.

James Thornton, chief executive of ClientEarth, the environmental law group which sued the UK government to improve its air pollution plan, said: \u201cVolvo\u2019s ambition in moving rapidly to cleaner technology should be heeded urgently by other manufacturers to defend the health of young and old alike.\u201d Capital cities such as Paris, Madrid, Athens and Mexico City have said they will ban diesel vehicles from 2025 to cut air pollution. That leaves electric cars or petrol cars with hybrid engines as an obvious way to help millions breathe easier \u2013 not to mention a readymade market for Volvo\u2019s future models.",

    "webTitle": "Mike Ashley: former colleague is trying to extort millions over 'banter'", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Mike Ashley has accused a former colleague of trying to extort millions of pounds from him by making out that a joke during \u201cludicrous\u201d drunk banter amounted to a \u00a315m business deal. The billionaire founder of Sports Direct repeatedly accused Jeff Blue, the banker he allegedly promised the bumper pay day, of being a \u201cliar\u201d and dismissed suggestions that he often makes multi-million pound deals while drunk in the pub as \u201ctotal crap\u201d. Ashley, who also owns Newcastle United, rubbished the suggestion that he regularly strikes seven-figure agreements in hostelries. Speaking in the high court, he said: \u201cI\u2019d have to live in the pub as I make business decisions every day. \u201cI take business decisions all day every day, from home, from the bath. Serious, serious decisions are not done on drunken nights out.\u201d Ashley also claimed he did not make all the decisions at Sports Direct. Displaying an apparently muddled grasp of the plot of Star Wars, he said he was not \u201cObi-Wan Kenobi running the Death Star\u201d. Ashley said paying out the money to Blue \u2013 who claims he was promised \u00a315m if Sports Direct\u2019s share price doubled over three years \u2013 would not be a problem as he was so rich that he didn\u2019t know what to spend his money on when he became a billionaire in 2007. However, the businessman said he couldn\u2019t recall making the alleged deal and if he had it would have been \u201cobviously just banter\u201d. \u201cI was already fabulously wealthy,\u201d he said of Sports Direct\u2019s flotation on the stock market 10 years ago. \u201cWhat do you think I did in the morning? Went out and bought the neighbour\u2019s house? \u2013 I already owned it.\u201d Ashley told the high court on Wednesday that he could not believe that Blue was \u201ctrying to take me for \u00a314m off the back of some drunk banter that he is seeking to engineer into something more\u201d. The claimed deal was for \u00a315m, but Blue was paid a \u00a31m bonus and is suing for the \u00a314m balance. Ashley, who is worth an estimated \u00a32.2bn, said he could not recall most of the alleged conversation with Blue at the Horse &amp; Groom pub in Fitzrovia, London, in 2013 as it was \u201ca heavy night of drinking\u201d. The sportswear tycoon said any talk about the company\u2019s stock price was only \u201cpulling each other\u2019s legs about what hypothetical value my shares would be worth \u2018on paper\u2019 at different share prices\u201d. The court heard that Ashley and Blue were part of a group of five men \u201chaving it large\u201d that night in 2013 with some of the men drinking 10 pints followed by vodka tonics and not getting home until 2am the next day or not going home at all. \u201cWhen we got to the pub we started drinking heavily at the bar and consumed a lot of alcohol during the evening,\u201d Ashley said. \u201cWe must have had four or five rounds of drinks in the first hour. At one point the judge, Mr Justice Leggatt, interrupted one of the bankers giving evidence to ask if the men had anything to eat to supplement the booze: \u201cmaybe some crisps,\u201d came the reply. Ashley, who was wearing a white shirt and black tie, denied Blue\u2019s assertion that Sports Direct business meetings are often accompanied with large quantities of alcohol in \u201cunusual venues\u201d. Blue told the court on Monday that Ashley once got so drunk during a drinking competition at one meeting that he vomited into a fireplace. Responding to Blue\u2019s allegations that he often conducted senior management meetings in pubs, hotels and casinos, Ashley said: \u201cIt\u2019s a drink after work. It\u2019s very boring up in Shirebrook [the location of Sports Direct\u2019s headquarters in Derbyshire]. You know what we do after work? We go to the pub.\u201d Blue had suggested in his evidence earlier in the week that the meetings were effectively \u201cpub lock-ins\u201d with dinner not served until 10.30pm and \u201calcohol continuing to be served well beyond closing hours, and fish and chips or kebabs being provided throughout the evening\u201d. Ashley said he would, on average, drink four beers and then move on to wine with dinner. \u201cOtherwise if I stayed on the beers I\u2019d have six \u2013 something in that region.\u201d When told by Blue\u2019s lawyer that his evidence might be more reliable as he did not drink as much, Ashley said: \u201cYou think that liar [Blue] is more reliable than me \u2013 very interesting.\u201d Ashley said it was Blue\u2019s \u201cgame plan\u201d to get Ashley to drink a lot and impress other bankers they were meeting in the pub. \u201cI find it incredible that Mr Blue is actually suggesting that I made a binding agreement for \u00a315m. It\u2019s nonsense,\u201d he said. \u201cIf I did say to Mr Blue that I would pay him \u00a315m if he could increase [Sports Direct\u2019s] share price to \u00a38, it would be obvious to everyone, including Mr Blue, that I wasn\u2019t being serious.\u201d He said Blue was bringing the case to make \u201callegations in his statement which are intended to damage my and/or Sports Direct\u2019s reputation.\u201d. Ashley denied Blue\u2019s claim that he personally paid Sports Direct chief executive Dave Forsey multi-million bonuses out of his own money in order to avoid having to raise the pay of other staff. \u201cThat\u2019s why he knows that he\u2019s a total liar and that has really pissed me off,\u201d Ashley told the judge. \u201cHe knows that\u2019s lies. Jeff Blue knows that\u2019s utter bullshit. \u201cI\u2019m furious at that allegation. Its wrong for them, it\u2019s wrong for people at Sports Direct. It\u2019s just totally untrue.\u201d Ashley said the conversation in the pub was often jokey and that much of it was about Newcastle United, the football club he owns. According to Tracey, Ashley joked about the \u00a335m transfer of Andy Carroll in 2011, saying he wanted to get the player \u201cacross to Liverpool on the helicopter as soon as possible\u201d because he knew the Merseyside club had \u00a350m in the bank from the sale of Fernando Torres. Ashley also denied Blue\u2019s claims that he personally paid Sports Direct chief executive Dave Forsey \u00a36m from his own funds, including a \u00a31m salary top-up paid from his own money to avoid having to raise the pay of other staff. He accused Blue of recording a private conversation in an attempt to \u201ctrap\u201d him into confirming the \u00a315m promise, an allegation he says was \u201cunderhanded of Mr Blue and shows his true colours\u201d. The case continues.",

      "body": "<p>Mike Ashley has accused a former colleague of trying to extort millions of pounds from him by making out that a joke during \u201cludicrous\u201d drunk banter amounted to a \u00a315m business deal.</p> <p>The billionaire founder of Sports Direct repeatedly accused Jeff Blue, the banker he allegedly promised the bumper pay day, of being a \u201cliar\u201d and dismissed suggestions that he often makes multi-million pound deals while drunk in the pub as \u201ctotal crap\u201d.</p> <p>Ashley, who also owns Newcastle United, rubbished the suggestion that he regularly strikes seven-figure agreements in hostelries. Speaking in the high court, he said: \u201cI\u2019d have to live in the pub as I make business decisions every day.</p> <p>\u201cI take business decisions all day every day, from home, from the bath. Serious, serious decisions are not done on drunken nights out.\u201d </p> <p>Ashley also claimed he did not make all the decisions at Sports Direct. Displaying an apparently muddled grasp of the plot of Star Wars, he said he was not \u201cObi-Wan Kenobi running the Death Star\u201d.</p> <p>Ashley said paying out the money to Blue \u2013 who claims he was promised \u00a315m if Sports Direct\u2019s share price doubled over three years \u2013 would not be a problem as he was so rich that he didn\u2019t know what to spend his money on when he became a billionaire in 2007. However, the businessman said he couldn\u2019t recall making the alleged deal and if he had it would have been \u201cobviously just banter\u201d. </p> <p>\u201cI was already fabulously wealthy,\u201d he said of Sports Direct\u2019s flotation on the stock market <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2007/feb/28/retail\">10 years ago</a>. \u201cWhat do you think I did in the morning? Went out and bought the neighbour\u2019s house? \u2013 I already owned it.\u201d </p> <p>Ashley told the high court on Wednesday that he could not believe that Blue was \u201ctrying to take me for \u00a314m off the back of some drunk banter that he is seeking to engineer into something more\u201d.

      "bodyText": "OK, time for a recap. A flurry of disappointing data have fuelled fears that Britain\u2019s economy is struggling to gain momentum. Growth in the service sector slowed to a four-month low in June, with companies blaming political uncertainty created by the general election and Brexit. Firms warned that they are facing higher costs, and struggling to find enough skilled workers. Markit, which compiled the report, says: UK service providers indicated another slowdown in business activity growth during June, which largely reflected the weakest upturn in new work since September 2016. Survey respondents commented on subdued business and consumer confidence, alongside some instances of delayed decision- making around the election. City experts say the figures show that the economy is faltering, just as Europe strengthens. Jasper Lawler of London Capital Group summed up the mood: Falling confidence in the service sector is compounded by the weakness in manufacturing reported on Monday. Rising prices will always slow consumption but it was hoped the advantage of a weaker currency to manufacturing would be a positive offset. Sterling managed to wind back some of its early loses because in the bigger picture, expectations are building that the Bank of England\u2019s next move will be to lift rates. In another blow, productivity across the UK has dropped by 0.5%, taking it back below the pre-crisis level, and highlighting the underlying weakness of the economy. ICAEW public sector director Ross Campbell says the government needs to act carefully to boost productivity. \u201cProductivity shouldn\u2019t be used as a buzzword simply to keep businesses happy. There have been signals from Government that we are likely to see an end to austerity and therefore a possible increase in public spending. With the economy still in a fragile state, it\u2019s imperative that any increased expenditure is allocated to areas that will help to drive economic growth - infrastructure, training, and fiscal stimulus.\u201d UK car sales have dropped for the third month running, falling by 4.8% in June. The industry body, the SMMT, blamed recent tax changes that encouraged people to buy new cars before April. However, economists say the slide shows consumers are cutting back. It\u2019s quite a contrast with the eurozone, where private sector companies have posted their strongest quarter in six years. Companies in Germany, France, Spain and Italy all reporting solid expansion last month. In happier news, Scotland has avoided falling into recession. New figures show that Scottish GDP expanded by 0.8% during the first three months of 2017. Union leaders, though, warn that the growth is build on underpaid workers. In other news... Sainsbury\u2019s has faced criticism at its AGM for abandoning Fairtrade tea; campaigners have warned that the whole Fairtrade movement could suffer. UK payments giant Worldpay has agreed terms of a takeover by US rival Vantiv. Worldpay\u2019s shares have slumped by 8.5% since the news broke, on disappointment that a bidding war with JP Morgan won\u2019t take place. Greek tourists hoping for a trip around the Acropolis tomorrow may be disappointed; workers have called a strike in protest at austerity cutbacks. The IMF has issued a warning to G20 leaders in general (and D. Trump in particular) to support world trade and avoid \u2018myopic\u2019 protectionism. That\u2019s probably all for today. Thanks for reading and for all the comments. GW Newsflash from Washington: the International Monetary Fund has warned world leaders to avoid \u2018myopic\u2019 trade policies. It looks like a none-too-subtle jab at president Trump, ahead of the G20 leaders meeting later this week. Greece\u2019s summer of discontent is hearing up. After striking rubbish collectors, guards at Greece\u2019s plethora of archaeological sites and museums are gearing up for a fight with prime minister Alexis Tsipras\u2019 government. Helena Smith reports from Athens. Culture ministry employees seconded to guard museums and archaeological sites announced they will walk off the job Thursday to press demands for better work conditions, including permanent positions. The strike, at the height of the tourist season, will keep all sites and museums closed including Athens\u2019 most visited monument, the 5th century BC Acropolis. In a statement, the employees\u2019 union said it wanted the Greek prime minister \u201cto immediately realise his promise\u201d to hire 200 extra guards at sites where understaffing was leading \u201cwith mathematical precision\u201d to either closure or safety issues. The Acropolis and other gems are expected to remained closed for several hours on Thursday morning. Culture ministry budgets have suffered greatly under the cuts demanded by international creditors keeping Greece\u2019s debt-stricken economy afloat. The leftist-led government, though sympathetic to the plight of employees who are also demanding overtime, is stuck between a rock and hard place in terms of satisfying demands that run counter to the tough strictures of creditors. Newsflash: US factory orders shrank by 0.8% in May, a worse performance than expected. That\u2019s the second monthly decline, after April\u2019s 0.3% decline. It suggests America\u2019s manufacturing sector may be slowing. American investors looking at Ireland as a beachhead into the European market believe the Trump administration may have more impact on their decision making than Brexit. That\u2019s according to Republic\u2019s Industrial Development Authority (IDA) today. Marking the news that more than 11,000 new jobs were created by IDA-backed foreign direct investments in the first half of this year, the IDA\u2019s CEO Martin Shanahan said \u201cgeopolitical instability is the main threat that clients see\u201d affecting their business performances in Ireland over the next two to three years. Referring to the upturning in FDI jobs in Ireland, Shanahan said: \u201cThe positive results are an indication of just how important Ireland\u2019s stable economic and political environment have become for investors. The twin challenges of both Brexit and a new US Administration have presented investors with much to think about. Indications suggest that investors believe that the new US administration may have more of an impact than Brexit.\u201d The government will be worried by the disappointing slide in UK productivity, which shank by 0.5% in the first three months of this year. Poor productivity usually leads to lacklustre growth, and ultimately weaker tax receipts; not ideal, if you\u2019re facing pressure to abandon austerity and end the public sector pay freeze. Sky News\u2019s Ian King has a good take: What will worry ministers almost as much are the sectoral and regional breakdowns provided by the ONS. It reports that in the manufacturing sector, output per hour actually improved by 0.2% during the quarter. However, in the services sector, output per hour fell by 0.6%. This has a bigger impact overall because the services sector accounts for around four-fifths of all UK economic activity. On a more encouraging front, productivity in the public sector was 3% higher in 2016 than in 2010, suggesting that the public sector has become more efficient in the face of spending cuts in some sectors. The regional and industry differences present a mixed picture. London and the South East remain the most productive parts of the UK, thanks to the high levels of financial services activity there, a factor that has helped make Scotland more productive than some other parts of the UK economy. The North East of England, a region long associated with industrial stagnation, also scores relatively highly thanks to high levels of what the ONS calls \u201cnon-manufacturing production\u201d. But other parts of the economy, notably Wales and Northern Ireland, score poorly. If you\u2019re just tuning in, here\u2019s our news story about the slowdown in UK service sector growth: Slowing growth across Britain\u2019s services companies in June completed a \u201ctriple whammy\u201d of disappointing economic news this week that also saw growth in the construction and manufacturing industries fade in response to Brexit uncertainty and weak consumer confidence. Activity in the services industry, which accounts for almost 80% of economic activity, fell to a four-month low in June, dragging down the all-sector IHS Markit/CIPS purchasing managers index (PMI) from 54.5 in May to 53.9 in June, the lowest since February. Some analysts said the weak set of figures indicated a broad softening in activity across the economy that was likely to dent the enthusiasm of Bank of England policymakers who have proposed increasing interest rates. Earlier this week, monetary policy committee members Michael Saunders and Ian McCafferty said persistent inflation and strong employment growth needed to be calmed by higher interest rates. Chief economist Andy Haldane recently indicated that he could vote for a rise later this year should the economy continue to expand. Chris Williamson, Markit\u2019s chief business economist, said: \u201cA slowing in services sector growth completes a triple-whammy of disappointing PMI survey readings. \u201cAlthough the three PMI surveys are running at levels that are historically consistent with GDP growing by around 0.4% in the second quarter, it\u2019s clear that the economy heads into the third quarter losing momentum.\u201d And here\u2019s the full story: Supermarket chain Sainsbury is facing criticism at its Annual General Meeting today, after it decided to replace fair trade teabags with a new \u201cFairly Traded\u201d label. Last week, Sainsbury announced it is introducing its own in-house certification scheme, set new ethical standards and introducing a different way to pay farmers. Campaigners are warning today that the move risks undermining the whole Fairtrade movement; the well-respected ethical certification scheme which was set up to give farmers in developing nations a better deal, and protect workers rights in some of the poorest parts of the world My colleague Sarah Butler is tweeting from the AGM in London: But chief executive Mike Coupe is defending the decision, claiming fair trade needs a reboot: Oxfam has organised a protest outside the AGM, involving \u2018human teabags\u2019 in an attempt to sway shareholders and board members. Matthew Spencer, Oxfam\u2019s Campaigns, Policy and Influencing Director, argues that Sainsbury\u2019s \u2018fairer trade\u2019 plan will give tea farmers a worse deal: \u201cFairtrade is a lifeline for many of the most vulnerable communities helping them educate their children and provide vital healthcare. \u201cSainsbury\u2019s is removing what little control some of the poorest tea farmers and producers have on how they spend the money they make, shifting decisions to a committee far away in London. This power grab turns an effective trade partnership into old school charitable grants. We urge Sainsbury\u2019s to stick with the gold standard Fairtrade mark, which is trusted around the world.\u201d Newsflash: JP Morgan is taking its ball home, rather than battling to take control of Britain\u2019s Worldpay. In a brief statement, JP Morgan says that it doesn\u2019t intend to bid for the company: JP Morgan Chase &amp; Co. (\u201cJ.P. Morgan\u201d) notes the announcement by Worldpay Group plc (\u201cWorldpay\u201d) on 4 July 2017. In response to an invitation from Worldpay, J.P. Morgan was at a very early stage in considering whether or not to make an offer or the terms of any offer for Worldpay. Following preliminary considerations, J.P. Morgan hereby announces that it does not intend to make an offer for Worldpay. J.P. Morgan continues to hold Worldpay in high regard. This leaves the field clear for Vantiv to complete its offer of 385p per share, announced a few minute ago. And shares in Worldpay have just fallen back to 383p, down 6% today, as the prospect of a juicy bidding war withers away. Just in: UK payments firm Worldpay has agreed to be taken over by US rival Vantiv in a \u00a37.7bn deal. Yesterday, FTSE 100-listed Worldpay revealed that it had received two separate bids, one from Vantiv and one from JP Morgan. The Vantiv deal (terms here) values Worldpay at \u00a33.85 per share (including a 5p dividend), which is a 19% premium on their value on Monday. However... Worldpay\u2019s shares are trading around 406p right now, indicating that the City believe there could be a bidding war. The Scottish economy has avoided a recession after the latest GDP figures showed growth of 0.8% in the last quarter to March 2017. Alarm about its prospects had deepened after the economy shrank by 0.2% in the previous quarter, leaving Scotland\u2019s economy trailing that of the UK as a whole. But the economy has bounced back in January-March. Nicola Sturgeon, the first minister, tweeted that the country\u2019s economy outperformed the UK\u2019s 0.2% for the last quarter. With Scotland\u2019s construction sector still contracting, a 4% growth in manufacturing and 3.1% growth in production help lift the overall figures, with chemicals including refined petroleum, and metals, driving those up. Sturgeon said that the Scottish government\u2019s intervention to help save the Dalzell steel plant had helped boost GDP. However, on an annualised basis Scotland\u2019s growth stood at 0.7%, still lagging substantially behind the UK\u2019s. Economists at the Fraser of Allander Institute said last week this sluggish growth was due to wider problems with Scotland\u2019s economy, and not just the effects of the slump in oil prices. John McLaren, an economist with Scottish Trends, said the latest figures showed Scottish growth had reached 1.2% over the past two years against 3.5% for the UK as a whole. Grahame Smith, general secretary of the Scottish TUC, said more urgent and substantial action was need to boost the economy, including scrapping the public sector pay cap. Smith argues: \u201cGrowth rates in Scotland have been low for several years and what growth there has been has in part resulted from hard pressed workers building up more debt and exhausting their savings. This is clearly unsustainable. \u201cIf steps are not taken to boost investment and demand and to prevent irresponsible private lending from destabilising the economy, another crash and recession is just round the corner.\u201d Sam Hill, Royal Bank of Canada\u2019s senior UK Economist, agrees that business confidence has been dented by the maelstrom in UK politics. On this week\u2019s PMI reports, he says: The mid-month surveys will have been conducted in a period of political uncertainty, following the hung parliament general election result and the start of formal Brexit negotiations. This may have contributed to an easing in the business expectations components of the surveys. For example, there was a 4.4-point drop in that part of the service PMI, leaving it 1.3 standard deviations below the long-run average. RBC predicts that the UK economy grew by 0.4% in the April-June quarter. That would be an improvement on the first quarter, when growth slowed to 0.2%, but still below trend. Here\u2019s some food for thought, from Scott Corfe, chief economist at the Social Market Foundation: The slowdown in UK service sector growth in June was \u201cdisappointing, but hardly surprising\u201d, says Howard Archer, chief economist at the EY Item Club. \u201cFollowing on from weaker manufacturing and construction surveys, the softer services PMI points to an already fragile economy struggling in June as heightened uncertainties about the UK outlook fuel business and consumer caution.\u201d Archer singles out the fall in new business growth, to a nine-month low, as a particular concern: Uncertainty appears to have caused some companies to limit or delay spending. Meanwhile, consumer-facing services companies continue to be hampered by squeezed purchasing power. The fall in UK productivity last quarter should send alarm bells ringing in Westminster, says Ian Brinkley, acting chief economist at the CIPD: \u201cToday\u2019s figures should act as a very sharp reminder to Government that Brexit is not the only challenge facing the UK. Unless more is done to tackle the nation\u2019s low productivity, people\u2019s wages and living standards will continue to fall and the UK will be ill-equipped to compete once we do leave the EU. \u201cGovernment must urgently review its productivity plan and ensure that its industrial strategy includes a much stronger focus on boosting investment in skills and efforts to boost managerial quality in partnership with employers, professional bodies and unions at a national, sector and local level.\u201d Steve Hill, external engagement director at The Open University, argues that better staff training is the key: \u201cAs the UK\u2019s productivity continues to fall,it\u2019s crucial that organisations invest in talent. The current skills gap is holding back business growth. Employers are struggling to recruit workers with the right skills and are paying inflated salaries and enhanced recruitment costs as a result. \u201cThe Apprenticeship Levy presents an opportunity for organisations to build better skills from within, developing a more efficient, engaged and productive workforce. Faced with a shrinking talent pool, organisations need agile and adaptable workers who can embrace change and meet new challenges.\u201d Ian Jones of the Press Association shows how productivity has been stagnant for a decade: This is from BBC personal finance correspondent Simon Gompertz: I hate to bring even more bad news... but Britain\u2019s productivity has fallen. UK labour productivity, as measured by output per hour, declined by 0.5% in the first three months of this year, according to new figures from the Office for National Statistics. It\u2019s the first fall since the end of 2015, and it highlights the underlying problems in the UK economy. Productivity in the services sector shrank by 0.6%, wiping out the benefits of a 0.2% rise in manufacturing productivity. As this chart shows, productivity has been persistently, and disappointing, weak since the financial crisis: Britain\u2019s productivity is much weaker than the US, France or Germany, as our workers have to put in more hours to achieve the same economic output. It\u2019s called the \u201cproductivity puzzle\u201d, because economist can\u2019t agree what\u2019s caused it. One factor is that more people are being employed in low-paid, insecure jobs, where they produce relatively little economic output. Another theory is that companies have resisted buying expensive machinery that would boost productivity, preferring to employ more people instead. Whatever the reason, it suggests that something rather nasty happened to the UK economy a decade ago when the financial crisis struck./ Guardian Business has launched a daily email. Besides the key news headlines that you\u2019d expect, there\u2019s an at-a-glance agenda of the day\u2019s main events, insightful opinion pieces and a quality feature to sink your teeth into each day. For your morning shot of financial news, sign up here: Duncan Brock of the Chartered Institute of Procurement &amp; Supply blames political uncertainty for the drop in UK service sector growth last month. \u201cA creeping doubt appears to be the cause of this month\u2019s below par performance as the UK\u2019s departure from the EU and the unpredictable political climate continues to impact on consumers and businesses alike. \u201cStrong growth in new orders and overall activity was destabilised by a reduction in business optimism, which fell to one of the lowest levels since 2011. Despite the slowdown, service sector companies kept hiring staff last month. However... some reported that it was difficult to find workers with the skills they need. In another blow, UK service sector companies were hit by a steep increase in their costs in June. Markit explains: Greater operating costs were linked to a combination of rising staff salaries and increased raw material prices (particularly food and imported items). Survey respondents noted that intense competition for new work continued to place pressure on pricing power. Reflecting this, the latest rise in average prices charged by service providers was the slowest since July 2016. Ed Conway of Sky News says this morning\u2019s data paints a worrying picture of the UK economy: Duncan Weldon of Resolution Group points out that Britain\u2019s economy is lagging, just as the eurozone posts its best quarter in six years: Chris Sood-Nicholls, managing director and head of global services at Lloyds Bank Commercial Banking, says the \u201cuncertain political backdrop\u201d is hurting UK firms: Many businesses may have delayed investment decisions in the face of an ambiguous political landscape. \u201cThe continued rise in inflation and the general uncertainty is denting consumer confidence which may impact on demand. The question remains as to how much businesses will be looking to invest during the rest of the year to help stimulate demand. This week\u2019s disappointing PMI surveys suggest that the UK economy will slow over the summer, warns Chris Williamson of Markit. Here\u2019s his take on this morning\u2019s data: \u201cA slowing in services sector growth completes a triple-whammy of disappointing PMI survey readings. Although the three PMI surveys are running at levels that are historically consistent with GDP growing by around 0.4% in the second quarter, it\u2019s clear that the economy heads into the third quarter losing momentum. \u201cWith business optimism having been hit by the intensification of political uncertainty following the general election and commencement of Brexit negotiations, at the same time that households are battling against rising inflation, the indications are that the economy\u2019s resilience is being tested. \u201cThere are pockets of growth, notably in financial services and business services, but the overall picture is one of business spending, investment and exports failing to provide sufficient impetus to fully offset the consumer slowdown. \u201cGiven the deterioration in the forward-looking indicators, such as business optimism and order book growth, the risks are tilted towards the economy slowing in the third quarter.\u201d The service sector slowdown is the third piece of disappointing UK economic news this week. A reminder: Monday: UK manufacturing PMI dropped to 54.3, from 56.3 Tuesday: UK construction PMI dropped to 54.8, from 56.0 Wednesday: UK services PMI drops to 53.4, from 53.8 Now, all those PMI figures are over 50, which indicates that Britain\u2019s private sector kept growing. But there are some chunky falls, particularly in the factor data, which suggest June wasn\u2019t a great month for the economy -- especially as we know that car sales fell too.... Worryingly, today\u2019s report also shows that UK business optimism has fallen to its weakest level since last summer\u2019s EU referendum. Markit says: Aside from the post-referendum dip last summer, the level of business optimism was the weakest since December 2011. Survey respondents cited anxiety related to the Brexit negotiations, alongside worries about the general economic outlook and heightened political uncertainty. Breaking: Growth in Britain\u2019s service sector has slowed to its lowest in four months, according to data firm Markit. Service sector companies, who make up around of the 80% of the UK economy, have reported that they experienced subdued business and consumer confidence in June. Some blamed delayed decision-making due to June\u2019s general election, and the uncertainty over Britain\u2019s exit from the European Union. This pulled the UK Services PMI down to 53.4, down from 53.8 in May. That\u2019s still over the 50-point mark that signals if the sector is expanding or contracting. Many firms reported that new business growth slowed in June; a sign that political uncertainty is hitting the economy. Markit says: The slowdown in business activity growth in June was linked to a softer rise in incoming new work across the service economy. Moreover, the latest increase in new work was the weakest for nine months. Anecdotal evidence cited Brexit-related risk aversion and heightened economic uncertainty as key factors holding back client spending. More to follow.... Graham Hiscott, business editor of the Mirror, says weakening consumer spending is hitting the car industry: Howard Archer of the EY Item Club agrees that April\u2019s tax changes are a factor (there\u2019s a good explanation here on Auto Express) Car sales to UK individuals, rather than businesses, shrank by nearly 8% in June. Sam Tombs of Pantheon Economics predicts further falls in the month ahead. He\u2019s tweeted a graph, showing how consumer confidence can be a leading indicator for the car market (he\u2019s shifted the consumer confidence figures ahead by six months) Diesel car sales fell particularly sharply last month, by almost 15%. Chris Giles of the FT says the figures are a concern: Breaking: UK car sales have fallen for the third month running. Car registrations declined by 4.8% in June, new figures from the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders show. That means that sales so far this year are down by 1.1%, following steeper falls in April and May. The SMMT blames recent tax changes for the fall. It says there was \u201cmarket turbulence\u2019 as drivers rushed to buy vehicles in March before new vehicle excise duty changes pushed up the cost of running many cars. Mike Hawes, SMMT Chief Executive, says the drop in car sales isn\u2019t a cause for alarm. \u201cAs forecast, demand for new cars has started to cool following five consecutive years of solid growth but the numbers are still strong and the first half of the year is the second biggest on record. Provided consumer and business confidence holds, we expect demand to remain at a similarly high level over the coming months. But... this decline may be a signal that consumers are being more cautious, or struggling to cope with rising inflation. I\u2019ll pull some more reaction together now. You can read the full eurozone PMI report here. It\u2019s official: The eurozone private sector has posted its best quarter since 2011, despite a slight slowdown in June. That\u2019s according to this morning\u2019s service sector data from Markit, plus manufacturing surveys released on Monday. Markit reports that its service sector PMI dropped to 55.4 last month, down from 56.3 in May. That drags the \u2018composite PMI\u2019, covering the whole private sector, down to 56.3 from 56.8. That\u2019s comfortably over the 50 point mark that separates expansion from contraction. Firms reported that new work kept rolling in, boosting business confidence and leading to strong job creation. Chris Williamson of Markit says the figure suggest the eurozone economy grew by an \u201cimpressive\u201d 0.7% in the second quarter of this year. The dip in the PMI in June certainly doesn\u2019t look like the start of a slowdown. Growth of new orders accelerated very slightly to reach the second- highest in just over six years, and companies are struggling to satisfy this increase in demand. \u201cOperating capacity is being strained despite the region seeing the best spell of employment growth for a decade in recent months. \u201cRising demand is also boosting firms\u2019 pricing power, both for goods and services. While price pressures have cooled since earlier in the year, linked mainly to lower global commodity prices, this is still the strongest period of inflationary pressure that the region has seen for six years. Germany\u2019s service sector growth slowed to a five-month low in June: French firms are still basking in the afterglow of Emmanuel Macron\u2019s victory. France\u2019s services PMI has hit 56.9 for June, only slightly down on May\u2019s 70-month high of 57.2. Firms reported a jump in new business, which meant they hired new staff at the fastest rate since March 2008. Alex Gill of Markit says the future looks positive for France: \u201cAs was the case in May, employment was a key talking point in June, with the rate of job creation the sharpest in over nine years. Robust client demand and a strong degree of optimism are likely to lead to further jobs growth over the coming months.\u201d Italy is next.... and its service sector growth has also slowed. The Italian services PMI has dropped to 53.6, down from 55.1 in May. That\u2019s lower than expected, but still firmly in \u2018expansion\u2019 territory. After a rollicking couple of years, Ireland\u2019s service sector took a little breather last month. The Irish Services PMI came in at 57.6 in June, a seven-month low, down from 59.5 in May. But that\u2019s still a pretty impressive figures, with firms reporting that new orders kept rising as client demand picked up. In the City, shares in housebuilder Persimmon have jumped by 3.5% to the top of the FTSE 100 leaderboard after posting strong financial results this morning. Persimmon completed 8% more houses in the first half of 2017 than a year ago, and grew its revenues by 12%. The company, which is Britain\u2019s second-largest builder, bullishly told shareholders that business is pretty good: \u201cWe have continued to experience good levels of customer demand\u2026 with the market taking the snap UK general election in its stride. Consumer confidence remains resilient and compelling mortgage rates continue to offer good support to new home buyers.\u201d Ol\u00e9! Spain\u2019s service sector has just posted its fastest growth in almost two years, as its recovery continues to build. The Spanish Services PMI has jumped to 58.3, up from 57.3 in May - a level showing strong growth. That\u2019s the best reading since August 2015. Spanish firms reported that growth in new business accelerated, job creation was the fastest in a year, and business optimism was high. Encouragingly, almost a quarter of the firms surveyed said they\u2019d taken on extra staff in June, partly because they\u2019re optimistic about their future workload. That could help to pull down Spain\u2019s jobless rate - the second highest in the eurozone, after Greece. Andrew Harker, Senior Economist at IHS Markit, says the \u201cThe Spanish service sector ended the first half of 2017 with a flourish, with PMI data for June signalling the strongest increases in output and new orders for almost two years and employment growth picking up as well. Firms also took advantage of strong demand conditions to raise their selling prices and provide a welcome boost to profit margins. Companies see little reason to doubt the sustainability of the upturn at present, reflected in our business confidence data remaining around the highest seen over the past two years. This morning\u2019s UK service sector report will be \u201ccritical\u201d for sterling, says Kathleen Brooks of City Index: A weaker than expected services sector PMI could see GBP/USD lose more momentum, which ironically may be good for the FTSE 100. This pair fell sharply on Monday after the worse than expected manufacturing PMI report for June, since the services report is more relevant for the UK economy then the pound reaction could be bigger if we get another data miss. Overnight, we\u2019ve seen that China\u2019s service sector slowed as firms were hit by subdued demand. The China Caixin services purchasing managers\u2019 index (PMI) dropped to 51.6, from May\u2019s 52.8 (a four-month high). Some businesses reported a drop in new orders, suggesting Beijing efforts to clamp down on cheap credit may be cooling the economy. Reuters has jumped the gun, and is reporting that \u2018preliminary data\u2019 shows that UK car sales fell again last month. They write: British new car registrations fell by around 5% last month year-on-year and overall sales for the first six months of the year dropped by 1%, according to preliminary data from an industry body. The Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders will release the full numbers at 0800 GMT [9am UK time]. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Britain\u2019s service sector makes up around 80% of the economy, from hotels and restaurants to haulage firms, accountants, and IT companies. So investors are nervously waiting to discover how they fared in June, and if last month\u2019s general election had any impact. Data firm Markit\u2019s monthly service sector PMI, due at 9,30am, is expected to drop to 53.5 from 53.8 in May. That would show that growth slowed last month, (50 being the cut-off point between expansion and contraction), and reinforce concerns that the economy is suffering from political uncertainty. RBC Capital Markets say: As with the earlier manufacturing and construction surveys, we expect to see some pull back in the services PMI this month; to 53.5 from 53.8 previously as the uncertainty caused by the general election result impacts on the predominantly domestically-focused sector. Even allowing for the weaker readings in the other sectors, an outcome in line with that expectation would still leave our PMI-based indicator pointing to GDP growth of 0.4% q/q though it would also reinforce the signals from those other sectors of the economy losing some momentum at the end of the quarter. The PMIs are calculated by asking purchasing managers across the country how their business is performing, so it\u2019s a useful snapshot of the situation. Given the size of the service sector, it could shift the pound - which is hovering around $1.291 his morning. There\u2019s also a flurry of other service sector reports from around the world today, including several European countries during the next couple of hours. City investors are also bracing for the latest UK car sales figures, due this morning. Sales fell in April and May (partly due to tax changes) so June\u2019s figure are nervously awaited. A third fall would fuel fears that consumers are cutting back on big-ticket items (and perhaps show that the Bank of England should hold fire on interest rates). On the corporate front, online supermarket chain Ocado and housebuilding group Persimmon are reporting results to the City.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "One morning early in 1985, on the stroke of nine o\u2019clock, Sir Owen Green, chairman of the industrial behemoth BTR, strode into the elegant central London offices of Dunlop, the tyre and rubber company, and delivered a takeover bid directly into the hands of its newly appointed chairman, Sir Michael Edwardes. In silence, Green, who has died aged 92, then turned on his heel and left. Although BTR (formerly Birmingham Tyre and Rubber) was later forced to raise its opening bid, the fate of Dunlop, already struggling to survive, had been sealed. Edwardes, then riding high in the corporate world on a reputation gained from turning around the troubled car maker British Leyland, had been brought in to save Dunlop, which had debts of half a billion pounds. Green, chief executive as well as chairman of BTR, was already a feared and seasoned operator in corporate takeovers from his earlier bitter but successful battle for the industrial group Thomas Tilling. In Dunlop, as in Tilling, Green saw underused assets, inefficient businesses and a grandiose corporate culture of waste. At Tilling, acquired a couple of years before the Dunlop raid, the top management operated from a mansion in Curzon Street, one of the most prestigious thoroughfares in London, waited on by a butler. The culture at Dunlop was perhaps best summed up in the use of a company Rolls-Royce with the number plate A1; when the takeover was complete, BTR transferred that number plate to a six-year-old Ford Granada. Green was born in Stockton-on-Tees and educated at Stockton grammar school; his father was a marine engineer. In 1942 he joined the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve, with which he served for the remainder of the second world war. On D-Day, he was part of the decoy group based near Dover whose task it was to \u201cmake a hell of a racket\u201d to convince the Germans that the landings would take place near Calais. When he left the navy in 1946, he trained as an accountant, qualifying in 1950. The career path that was to lead him to become one of the most respected businessmen of the 1980s began when he was appointed finance director at Oil Feed Engineering, which was then acquired by BTR. He became BTR\u2019s managing director in 1967. Green believed in hard work and leadership by example, a conviction that dated to his time in the navy and stayed with him throughout his working life. Unlike Tilling and Dunlop, BTR operated from modest offices in Victoria, central London. When he decided that the group needed the advice of financial public relations consultants, he telephoned the offices of half a dozen firms on the day after Boxing Day. Those with senior staff actually in the office that day got to pitch for the business. Although he professed a cast-iron rule that his executives should retire at the age of 60, Green carried on until he was 68. He adhered to few of the best-practice rules surrounding the boardroom makeup of public companies. He had no time for non-executive directors and had none on his board. He told a conference of investors that shareholders did not own a company. In 1993, the year he retired, he wrote a trenchant article for the Daily Mail on what he saw as boardroom greed, in which he said: \u201cHow a director who has just had an 18% pay rise dares to tell his workers to show restraint and accept less than 5% I cannot understand.\u201d He suggested that such executives had lost touch with the people who actually did the work, and pointed out that, in many cases, executive pay and perks went up regardless of whether a company\u2019s shares rose or fell. At that time, when some company chiefs were counting their packages in millions, Green\u2019s own remuneration was \u00a3217,000 \u2013 modest indeed for a company turning in profits of more than a billion pounds annually. Not that Green was dour or lacked the human touch. To celebrate his 90th birthday, half a dozen or so friends and former business associates gathered for lunch at the Goring hotel in London. Each had brought a small gift. But the birthday surprise came from Green himself. He had bought each of the guests a clock mounted in a case that reflected their individual interests \u2013 for one it was a set of cricket stumps, another a golf bag, and so on. Such attention to detail and taking the time to find out about the people he encountered in his business life was a key characteristic that enabled Green to mastermind the phenomenal growth of BTR from a rather worn-out Midlands manufacturer into a multibillion-pound industrial conglomerate. A measure of his success is that \u00a31,000 invested in BTR when he took over would have been worth \u00a31m by the time he retired. He was voted businessman of the year in 1982 and knighted for services to industry in 1984. His wife, Doreen (nee Spark), whom he married in 1948, died in 2006. He is survived by their son and two daughters, four grandchildren and four great-grandchildren. \u2022 Owen Whitley Green, industrialist, born 14 May 1925; died 1 June 2017",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "New car sales in the UK went into reverse for a third month in June in the latest sign that consumers are becoming increasingly reluctant to commit to major spending decisions. Sales fell by 4.8% year on year last month to 243,454, following an 8.5% drop in May and a 19.8% slide in April, according to the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT). In the first half of the year overall, new car sales fell by 1.3% to 1.4m vehicles, which was still the second biggest first half on record. In the second quarter overall, new car sales fell by 10.3%, the biggest quarterly drop in more than six years. The slowdown in recent months follows five years of growth in new car sales, which has helped to underpin consumer-led growth in the wider economy. Unions have warned that UK households face a fresh crisis in living standards as inflation rises faster than wages, leaving consumers with less money to spend. \u201cDemand for new cars has started to cool following five consecutive years of solid growth but the numbers are still strong and the first half of the year is the second biggest on record,\u201d said Mike Hawes, the SMMT chief executive. \u201cProvided consumer and business confidence holds, we expect demand to remain at a similarly high level over the coming months.\u201d The strong first-half performance was skewed by March, the biggest month for new car sales since the trade body started collecting data in 1976. Analysts said it was a bumper month because consumers brought forward car purchases to avoid a rise in vehicle excise duty on 1 April. An explosion in cheap car finance deals has fuelled growth in consumer credit to such an extent that the sector has attracted scrutiny from the Bank of England and the Financial Conduct Authority. The Bank\u2019s governor, Mark Carney, warned last week that the rapid increase in consumer credit was among \u201cpockets of risk\u201d in the financial system. While broader consumer credit is growing at a rate of about 10% a year, car finance is growing by 15%. Tamzen Isacsson, a director at the SMMT, said finance deals were an affordable and flexible way for motorists to buy a range of cars. She added: \u201cThe motor finance market is highly competitive and governed by strict rules but given the recent growth in the popularity of motor finance it is understandable that regulators want to know how the market is operating in more depth. We look forward to engaging in this process.\u201d Smaller cars, typically powered by smaller petrol engines, were most popular among buyers in June, with superminis and small family cars accounting for almost 60% of the market. Diesel car sales fell by 14.7%, while petrol car sales rose by 2.5% and sales of alternative fuel vehicles jumped 29% to 10,721. Demand dropped among all types of customers, including private buyers, business and fleet. \u201cIt\u2019s encouraging to see alternatively fuelled vehicles experiencing rapid growth but adoption is still at a relatively low level and more long term incentives are required if this new generation of vehicles is to be a more common sight on British roads,\u201d Hawes said.

It is not just that the performance in the first three months of 2017 was poor. The 0.5% quarterly drop in output per hour worked meant productivity fell back below where it was in the last quarter of 2007, the period immediately before the economy nosedived into recession. Such a long period without any productivity growth is unprecedented in modern times. Normally what happens is that productivity falls in the early stage of a recession but then bounces back and returns to its pre-slump trend. That, though, hasn\u2019t happened since 2007, with profound consequences for living standards. Rising productivity means that a society is finding new and better ways of providing goods and services. Broadly speaking, more is produced with less effort. Societies have the choice of consuming more or having more leisure time. Usually, they opt for a bit of both. The Office for National Statistics says that, had productivity in the UK returned to its pre-recession trend, it would be 20% higher than its current level. Britain would be one fifth better off. It is easier to explain what has happened than why it has happened. Economic output fell sharply during the recession of 2008-09 and subsequently recovered modestly so that it is some 8% higher than its previous peak. But the number of people employed has also been going up, so the amount produced per worker per hour has remained unchanged. There are plenty of explanations for why productivity has flatlined. One factor has been the shift in economic output and labour from high productivity industries in recent years. While the number of people working on North Sea oil and gas rigs has gone down, the number of people employed by supermarkets to fill shopping baskets for home deliveries has gone up. Governments have also used a carrot-and-stick approach to get the jobless back to work. They have tightened up eligibility for unemployed benefits while simultaneously providing tax credits to boost low wages. This, together with a big increase in migration, has increased the supply of low-skill labour, much of which has ended up doing low-productivity tasks. Businesses are in a strong financial position. The rate of return on capital is the highest it has been since the boom years of the late 1980s. This would normally be the cue for firms to spend more on innovation and new machines, both of which would lead to higher productivity. But, with labour so plentiful and the outlook murky, it is less risky for firms to respond to any pickup in demand by hiring some cheap workers rather than by investing in some new kit.

      "bodyText": "Slowing growth across Britain\u2019s services companies in June completed a \u201ctriple whammy\u201d of disappointing economic news this week that also saw growth in the construction and manufacturing industries fade in response to Brexit uncertainty and weak consumer confidence. Activity in the services industry, which accounts for almost 80% of economic activity, fell to a four-month low in June, dragging down the all-sector IHS Markit/CIPS purchasing managers index (PMI) from 54.5 in May to 53.9 in June, the lowest since February. Some analysts said the weak set of figures indicated a broad softening in activity across the economy that was likely to dent the enthusiasm of Bank of England policymakers who have proposed increasing interest rates. Earlier this week, monetary policy committee members Michael Saunders and Ian McCafferty said persistent inflation and strong employment growth needed to be calmed by higher interest rates. Chief economist Andy Haldane recently indicated that he could vote for a rise later this year should the economy continue to expand. Chris Williamson, Markit\u2019s chief business economist, said: \u201cA slowing in services sector growth completes a triple-whammy of disappointing PMI survey readings. \u201cAlthough the three PMI surveys are running at levels that are historically consistent with GDP growing by around 0.4% in the second quarter, it\u2019s clear that the economy heads into the third quarter losing momentum.\u201d Williamson said the surveys of business optimism revealed a steep decline following the general election and commencement of Brexit negotiations. \u201cAt the same time that households are battling against rising inflation, the indications are that the economy\u2019s resilience is being tested,\u201d he said. \u201cIt would therefore be a surprise to see policymakers vote for a rate increase. According to historical comparisons, the current PMI reading would be more consistent with the Bank of England cutting interest rates rather than hiking. The surveys show there are pockets of growth in financial services and business services, but the overall picture is one of business spending, investment and exports failing to provide sufficient impetus to fully offset the consumer slowdown. Inflation has climbed to 2.9% while wages are only rising by little more than 2%, leaving millions of households to face falling living standards. GDP growth is expected to recover in the second quarter to between 0.4% and 0.5% after stumbling in the first quarter to just 0.2%. However, the lack of momentum in output and deteriorating expectations of a business-friendly outcome from the Brexit negotiations means the UK economy could stagnate in the third quarter. \u201cGiven the deterioration in the forward-looking indicators, such as business optimism and order book growth, the risks are tilted towards the economy slowing in the third quarter,\u201d said Williamson. Scott Bowman, UK economist at the consultancy Capital Economics, said the gloom cast by the PMI was overdone and the economy remained resilient. \u201cThe three-month average of the all-sector PMI is still consistent with quarterly GDP growth of 0.5% or so in the second quarter. And while the PMI overestimated growth in the first three months of the year, it excludes the retail sector \u2013 which performed poorly in the first quarter but looks likely to have recorded a stronger performance in the second. \u201cWhat\u2019s more, hard output data for March and April have set a fairly good base for growth in the second quarter. Accordingly, we still think that GDP growth will accelerate to close to 0.5% in the three months to June, from the first quarter\u2019s 0.2% rate.\u201d",

H\u00e5kan Samuelsson, the Volvo chief executive, said: \u201cThis announcement marks the end of the solely combustion engine-powered car.\u201d He said the company was reacting to customers who had asked for electric cars, though the move will also help the Swedish firm meet legally-binding carbon targets for new cars sold in the EU from 2020. The carmaker, owned by Chinese automotive giant Geely, has yet to build a single fully electric car but already sells five plug-in hybrid models that can run a few dozen miles on battery power before switching to a conventional engine. The pricing of those models suggests drivers will pay a premium for future Volvo cars \u2013 the basic plug-in hybrid version of its XC90 SUV crossover costs \u00a361,650, \u00a313,250 more than the basic diesel edition. Several of the major carmakers, including Renault-Nissan, BMW and VW, have declared ambitious plans for electric cars, supported with grants by governments, which see them as a key way of tackling air pollution and climate change. The VW emissions scandal gave added impetus for companies to focus on the technology, as politicians and campaigners increasingly blamed diesel for cities\u2019 air quality problems. The cars that Volvo produces from 2019 onwards will range from battery-only to plug-in hybrid \u2013 which can run for a significant distance before switching to petrol or diesel \u2013 and mild hybrids, where a battery helps a conventional engine achieve greater fuel economy. Asked if the announcement showed diesel was dead, Samuelsson said: \u201cLong-term, diesel will get more and more expensive, because it requires some after-treatment.\u201d Volvo said in May it was considering ceasing development on next-generation diesel engines. Of Elon Musk\u2019s Tesla, whose \u2018mass market\u2019 Model 3 is expected to roll off the production line later this week, Samuelsson said: \u201cIt\u2019s a tough competitor. But with this decision we are really becoming the second premium car maker in the world which will also be all-electrified.\u201d Volvo said the first of its electric cars will be built in China, but others would be made in Europe and the US. The company said it had not yet decided on a battery supplier. Prof David Bailey, an automotive expert at Aston University, said: \u201cIt\u2019s indicative of the speeding up of the shift over to electrics, particularly in the wake of the VW dieselgate scandal, and it\u2019s a sign that the industry is really starting to move and it will become mainstream. \u201cBy the mid-2020s I expect there to be a tipping point where the electric car starts to outcompete the internal combustion engine. It\u2019s the way it\u2019s going.\u201d The potential carbon savings of a widespread shift to electric cars are huge. Although globally coal still accounts for about 40% of electricity generation and gas around 21%, countries such as the UK now source a significant amount of power from low carbon sources, such as renewables and nuclear. A quarter of UK carbon emissions are from road transport. \u201cWe have to decarbonise the transport system, and the shift to electric cars is part of that. Even with the current energy mix, in terms of how we generate electricity, there will be a benefit in CO2, let alone the shift to further renewables,\u201d said Bailey, adding that the cars could also \u201cdramatically improve urban air quality\u201d. Ben Lane, the director of Next Green Car, a guide to low-emission vehicles, said: \u201cIt\u2019s not quite the same as saying they will not make any internal combustion engines, but it\u2019s obviously a key moment.\u201d Both experts said of all the car companies, Ford was the biggest laggard on the transition to electric vehicles. Globally, the cumulative number of electric cars broke the 2m barrier last year, up from hundreds in 2005. But as a report published on Wednesday shows, some parts of the world are moving faster than others. In the EU last year, 1.9% of new car registrations were for hybrids, 0.7% were plug-in hybrids and 0.6% were pure electric. In Norway, the International Council on Clean Transportation found, pure electric models accounted for 15.7% of new car sales in 2016. While Toyota and its Prius lead on the highest share for hybrids, Renault-Nissan and BMW are top of the pack for pure electric cars. Volvo commanded a considerable share (4.5%) of the plug-in electric market, alongside Porsche on 4.8%. With bullish projections by Bloomberg New Energy Finance that electric models will make up 35% of all new car sales by 2040, oil companies are increasingly worried about the impact on them. However, firms such as BP are dismissive of the effect the cars will have on oil demand. Greenpeace hailed the move by Volvo, and said other manufacturers should follow suit. \u201cVolvo has recognised the huge gains to be made by leading the way in electric. We know electric vehicles are the future, and it\u2019s not a case of if, but when, old-style cars powered by climate-wrecking fossil fuels will be a thing of the past,\u201d said Paul Morozzo, a campaigner at the environmental group. Volvo\u2019s owner, Geely, also has interests in electric vehicles through its ownership of a \u00a3300m factory in Coventry that will build electric black cabs. The first zero-emission versions of the iconic cab, the TX5, will be delivered this year, before new Transport for London rules that require new black cabs to be battery-powered from 1 January.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "A City trader who witnessed Sports Direct billionaire Mike Ashley allegedly agree to pay a banker \u00a315m during a boozy session in a London pub has dismissed the claimed deal as \u201cjust a laugh in a pub\u201d. Simon McEvoy said he \u201cjust could not believe\u201d Ashley\u2019s former colleague Jeff Blue was attempting to force the sportswear tycoon to pay out millions on what he thought was \u201cso obviously a joke\u201d and \u201cbanter\u201d. \u201cI knew that they [Blue\u2019s lawyers] wanted to pursue Mike [Ashley] for what was supposedly an agreement, but to me was just a laugh in the pub,\u201d McEvoy, a trader at Espirito Santo Investment Bank, told the high court on Wednesday. \u201cTo me it was ludicrous, so it was obviously a joke.\u201d Blue is suing Ashley for \u00a314m he claims Ashley owes him from the alleged deal sealed in the Horse &amp; Groom pub in London\u2019s Fitzrovia in 2013. He claims that Ashley agreed to pay him \u00a315m if he could help double Sports Direct\u2019s share price within three years. The shares did hit the \u00a38-a-share target, and Blue was paid a \u00a31m bonus but is pursuing Ashley for the claimed balance. Ashley, who is due to give evidence on Wednesday afternoon, has dismissed Blue\u2019s claims and said the conversation was just \u201cbanter\u201d. In a statement, the sportswear tycoon said: \u201cI can\u2019t believe that [Mr Blue] is now trying to take me for \u00a314m off the back of some drink banter that he is seeking to engineer into something more.\u201d Lawyers for Ashley told the court he could not remember details of the \u201cbanter and bravado\u201d conversation in the pub, \u201cparticularly in the light of the amount of drinking\u201d. On Wednesday the case was moved into a larger court room at the high court due to the number of reporters turning up to hear Ashley\u2019s evidence. Blue is claiming that Ashley, who controls Sports Direct and Newcastle United, often conducts business in pubs, casinos and various other \u201cunusual venues\u201d while under the influence and the setting of the meeting should not invalidate the alleged deal. McEvoy, who was one of a group of five people involved in the pub conversation in January 2013, said he did hear it suggested that Blue should be rewarded with the multimillion-pound bonus if Sports Direct shares hit \u00a38. But he said \u201ceveryone burst out laughing, it was so clearly a joke\u201d. He said he could not believe it when Blue\u2019s lawyers contacted him for his recollection of that evening. \u201cI just could not believe that they were trying to pursue what happened in the pub, and therefore it was a waste of my time,\u201d he said. McEvoy denied the suggestion from Blue\u2019s lawyer that he may be \u201cexpecting some sort of reward\u201d from Ashley in return for his evidence. A second broker present at the pub that night said he also recalled the conversation about Blue being rewarded if the shares hit \u00a38 but thought it was a joke and didn\u2019t think Ashley should have to pay. \u201cWhy would Mike pay up for something that was banter,\u201d Peter Tracey, who also worked at Espirito, told the court. \u201cWhy would you be held to a chat in the pub?\u201d. Tracey said it had been a great night and he wished those present in court could have been there. \u201cIt was five guys and a barman in the pub \u2013 I wish you could have been there it was a great night,\u201d he said. \u201cA billionaire owner of a football club talking about life \u2013 it was fascinating, it was great. \u201cThere was a huge amount of laughter that night \u2013 it was a great evening. We had just spent a great deal of time discussing football transfers, and then the conversation went on to the reason we are here [in court]. And, if numbers were being thrown about it was frankly a bit surreal.\u201d Tracey said he didn\u2019t make it home that night and \u201cutilised the office sofabed and was woken up by a colleague the next morning\u201d. Earlier this week, Blue gave the court an extraordinary picture of Ashley\u2019s working practices, including a claim that he would challenge subordinates to extreme drinking competitions that once ended with the 52-year-old billionaire vomiting into a fireplace. Blue said the rules of the drinking game were that whoever left the room first was to be declared the loser. \u201cAfter approximately 12 pints and chasers Pawel [Pawlowski] apologised profusely and had to excuse himself,\u201d Blue said. \u201cMr Ashley then vomited into the fireplace located in the centre of the bar, to huge applause from his senior management team.\u201d Ashley was also alleged to have held regular senior management meetings during \u201clock-ins\u201d at the Green Dragon pub in Alfreton near Sports Direct\u2019s warehouse. During other meetings Ashley is alleged to have expressed his \u201cboredom and frustration\u201d with City figures by lying under the table to \u201chave a nap\u201d. On another occasion Ashley and his senior Sports Direct colleagues drank the Michelin star restaurant Benares out of \u00a33,000 bottles of red wine. \u201cDinner was held in a private dining room at Benares restaurant at 12a Berkeley Square House,\u201d Blue said in his witness statement. \u201cThe dinner commenced with Mr Ashley ordering ... drinks, in this case the most expensive red wine available from the sommelier (Richebourg at around some \u00a33,000 per bottle). \u201cWhen supplies of this had been exhausted, Mr Ashley continued with the Penfolds Grange (\u00a3875 per bottle). The case continues.",

But he said \u201ceveryone burst out laughing, it was so clearly a joke\u201d. </p> <p>He said he could not believe it when Blue\u2019s lawyers contacted him for his recollection of that evening. \u201cI just could not believe that they were trying to pursue what happened in the pub, and therefore it was a waste of my time,\u201d he said. </p> <p>McEvoy denied the suggestion from Blue\u2019s lawyer that he may be \u201cexpecting some sort of reward\u201d from Ashley in return for his evidence. </p> <p>A second broker present at the pub that night said he also recalled the conversation about Blue being rewarded if the shares hit \u00a38 but thought it was a joke and didn\u2019t think Ashley should have to pay. </p> <p>\u201cWhy would Mike pay up for something that was banter,\u201d Peter Tracey, who also worked at Espirito, told the court. \u201cWhy would you be held to a chat in the pub?\u201d.</p> <p>Tracey said it had been a great night and he wished those present in court could have been there. \u201cIt was five guys and a barman in the pub \u2013 I wish you could have been there it was a great night,\u201d he said. \u201cA billionaire owner of a football club talking about life \u2013 it was fascinating, it was great. </p> <p>\u201cThere was a huge amount of laughter that night \u2013 it was a great evening. We had just spent a great deal of time discussing football transfers, and then the conversation went on to the reason we are here [in court]. And, if numbers were being thrown about it was frankly a bit surreal.\u201d</p> <p>Tracey said he didn\u2019t make it home that night and \u201cutilised the office sofabed and was woken up by a colleague the next morning\u201d.</p> <p>Earlier this week, Blue gave the court an extraordinary picture of Ashley\u2019s working practices, including a claim that he would challenge subordinates to extreme drinking competitions that once ended with the 52-year-old billionaire vomiting into a fireplace.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Blue said the rules of the drinking game were that whoever left the room first was to be declared the loser. \u201cAfter approximately 12 pints and chasers Pawel [Pawlowski] apologised profusely and had to excuse himself,\u201d Blue said. \u201cMr Ashley then vomited into the fireplace located in the centre of the bar, to huge applause from his senior management team.\u201d</p> <p>Ashley was also alleged to have held regular senior management meetings during \u201clock-ins\u201d at the Green Dragon pub in Alfreton near Sports Direct\u2019s warehouse. During other meetings Ashley is alleged to have expressed his \u201cboredom and frustration\u201d with City figures by lying under the table to \u201chave a nap\u201d.</p> <p>On another occasion Ashley and his senior Sports Direct colleagues drank the Michelin star restaurant Benares out of \u00a33,000 bottles of red wine. </p> <p>\u201cDinner was held in a private dining room at Benares restaurant at 12a Berkeley Square House,\u201d Blue said in his witness statement. \u201cThe dinner commenced with Mr Ashley ordering ... drinks, in this case the most expensive red wine available from the sommelier (Richebourg at around some \u00a33,000 per bottle).</p> <p>\u201cWhen supplies of this had been exhausted, Mr Ashley continued with the Penfolds Grange (\u00a3875 per bottle).</p> <p>The case continues.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Demand for fresh fruit and veg and a dash for paddling pools, summer clothes and fans helped Sainsbury\u2019s deliver its strongest sales growth in more than four years. Sales at stores open more than a year, excluding fuel, rose by 2.3% in the 16 weeks to 1 July, up from 0.3% in the previous three months partly thanks to the warm start to the summer. It was the strongest pace of growth since March 2013. Mike Coupe, the Sainsbury\u2019s group chief executive, said: \u201cWe have delivered a strong performance, driven by our differentiated strategy, offering customers quality, value and choice across food, general merchandise, clothing and financial services.\u201d The group, which also owns Argos, was partly helped by the timing of Easter and Mother\u2019s Day, which it said had contributed about 0.3 percentage points of the growth. Excluding that factor, the pace was still slightly ahead of City expectations of 1.9% growth. Coupe said shoppers were snapping up Sainsbury\u2019s own-label products after it had implemented hundreds of quality improvements and held prices on basics including milk, chicken breast and eggs. He said inflation, which is now running at more than 2.5% according to the CPI index, had started to hit towards the end of the period but Sainsbury\u2019s had \u201cmanaged to keep a control over prices and the impact on customers\u201d. Fresh produce performed particularly well, outperforming the market with volume growth of 1% as Sainsbury\u2019s cut the price of summer favourites including Jersey Royal potatoes and British strawberries. That helped boost total grocery sales by 3% compared to 0.3% growth in the previous three months. Coupe played down the impact of the weather. He said that the number of warm days over the whole period was \u201cnot far off the same\u201d as last year. He pointed to Sainsbury\u2019s improvement in price position relative to its competitors for the group\u2019s step up in performance. Coupe also said there were signs that shoppers were choosing to eat at home rather than go out for meals as disposable income came under pressure from rising inflation. But he said: \u201cWe are not seeing a massive change in consumer behaviour.\u201d Online grocery sales rose by 8%, Sainsbury\u2019s convenience store sales were up by 10% and clothing sales rose by 7.2%. All the supermarkets have been lifted by a combination of a warm start to the summer and rising inflation. Sainsbury\u2019s said the number of transactions carried out in its stores rose by 2%. Coupe said that Sainsbury\u2019s general merchandise and clothing ranges, including Argos, outperformed the market, as its fast track delivery and collect-from-store services recorded a \u201cstellar performance\u201d during the quarter, particularly during the warm weather when customers wanted items such as paddling pools and electric fans on the day. Total sales rose 1% despite the closure of dozens of Argos and Habitat outlets in Homebase stores after the takeover of the DIY chain buy Australian firm Bunnings. Sainsbury\u2019s said it had opened 10 convenience stores in the period but made no mention of Nisa, the wholesale buying group with which it is understood to be in exclusive talks. Coupe said: \u201cLots of conversations are had and there is lots of speculation but lots of things don\u2019t come off.\u201d The supermarket is thought to be considering a \u00a3130m takeover of Nisa, which supplies and provides marketing support to thousands of small independent stores. Nisa\u2019s 1,400 members, which include the McColl\u2019s convenience store chain, operate 2,500 shops. They would have to approve any takeover and many are fiercely protective of their independence. Laith Khalaf, a senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said the bigger picture remained challenging for UK supermarkets: \u201cWeaker sterling is pushing up food prices and putting a dent in consumers\u2019 purses, while the trading environment remains as competitive as ever. \u201cIndeed the turf war the big supermarkets have been fighting against the discounters may start to look like a schoolyard skirmish if Amazon decides it wants a piece of the UK grocery market.\u201d David Alexander, the lead analyst at GlobalData, said: \u201cWith Sainsbury\u2019s receiving a significant helping hand from the upturn in fortunes for the wider grocery sector, it is too soon to judge whether this quarter represents a more positive new chapter for the grocer. That said, the change in tone is promising.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Worldpay, the UK\u2019s largest electronic payment processing group, is the subject of a takeover tussle less than two years after floating on the stock market. Shares in the group closed up nearly 28% on Tuesday, making it the biggest riser on the FTSE 100, after it revealed separate approaches from US payment handler Vantiv, and JPMorgan Chase bank. At this level, the group is valued at more than \u00a38bn. The takeover battle for Worldpay underlines the boom in the electronic payments industry, as more people shift from cash to paying online and in store card transactions switch from chip and pin to contactless. Figures from the British Retail Consortium show that cash was used for less than half of all UK retail transactions for the first time in 2015. The rise of contactless card payments accelerated the trend away from cash, according to the BRC, proving a popular payment method for lower value transactions that used to be the mainstay for cash. The number of non-cash transactions globally rose by about 10% to 426bn in 2015 according to the latest estimates from Capgemini world payments report. Under takeover rules Vantiv and JPMorgan have a deadline of 5pm on 1 August to make a firm offer or walk away. \u201cThere can be no certainty either that an offer will be made nor as to the terms of any offer, if made. A further announcement will be made if appropriate,\u201d Worldpay said in a statement. Launched in 1989, Worldpay provides the technology that allows retailers and other business to accept card payments and online or mobile transactions. Worldpay, chaired by City veteran Sir Michael Rake, processed 15bn transactions in 2016, with revenue rising 15% to \u00a34.5bn and pre-tax profits leaping to \u00a3264m from \u00a319m in 2015. Previous owner Royal Bank of Scotland sold the business in 2010 under the terms of the bank\u2019s 2008 British taxpayer bailout, with private equity firms Bain Capital and Advent International taking control. Since then Worldpay has expanded rapidly, with the number of employees rising from about 2,000 to more than 5,000. The business is based in London but also has major offices in Manchester, Cambridge and Gateshead. The takeover approaches show how payment processors have become attractive targets for banks, technology firms, and credit card companies at a time of rapid growth for the sector. Over the weekend, Danish payments services company Nets said it had been approached by potential suitors. Analysts said news that Worldpay was being circled by potential bidders could trigger interest from others. \u201cWe believe Worldpay is a unique asset and the current interest from two US peers could also trigger the intention of parties like Google, Amazon, Apple,\u201d said analysts at Mediobanca Securities. Angelo Meda, head of equities at Banor Capital, said more consolidation in the sector was likely. \u201cThis is one of the most intriguing sub-sectors in the financials space. There are a lot of companies still, and we are probably going to have only one or two big leaders in the payments space.\u201d Worldpay group floated in 2015, with Rake as chairman and Philip Jansen as chief executive. Rake\u2019s other roles include chairman of BT, and he was previously deputy chairman of Barclays and president of the CBI business lobby group. During his time at Barclays, Rake was instrumental in ousting chief executive Antony Jenkins in July 2015, following a boardroom row over the future of Barclays\u2019 investment banking business. \u201cHaving only joined the FTSE 100 in 2015, [Worldpay] was a welcome addition to an index that had become overpopulated by banks and miners,\u201d said Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at spread betting firm IG. \u201cIts departure would mark a step backward for the UK\u2019s top-line index.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Another day, another round of apologies and expressions of deep regret from Lloyds for the victims of the HBOS Reading fraud. The occasion this time was the publication of a few passages from a 2012 regulator\u2019s report that had previously been redacted while police investigated the scandal. The relevant paragraphs show that Reading alone was responsible for \u00a3240m of the provisioning in HBOS\u2019s accounts in 2007. The figure tallies with sums that emerged during this year\u2019s court case that led to the jailing of six individuals. But the timing of the \u00a3240m provision is interesting. It suggests that Lloyds, which bought HBOS in January 2009, would have known the size of the mess in Reading on day one of its ownership. It may be true that, at that stage, Lloyds viewed the affair as merely a case of bad lending by HBOS\u2019s out-of-control operations. But, given the size of the provision, the complaints of fraud by the small business customers were plainly worthy of investigation. How were those complaints handled, and by whom? The allegation \u2013 heard consistently over the years, and very loudly since sentences were passed in February \u2013 is that Lloyds tried to cover up the fraud and was deaf to the victims\u2019 arguments. The bank argues its hands were tied once police started to investigate in 2010 and that, in any case, fraud was only established in court. But, at the conclusion of the trial, it appointed Dame Linda Dobbs, a retired high court judge, to review the complaints of a cover-up. The important thing now is that the Dobbs review is published in full. As things stand, Lloyds has merely committed to share the findings with the Financial Conduct Authority. That is how the regulatory system works but, between them, Lloyds and the FCA need to find a way to get the findings in the public domain. A decade on, only the full story will do. Worldpay should be predator, not prey Damn. Royal Bank of Scotland \u2013 the 72% state-owned bank \u2013 sold Worldpay for \u00a32bn to a private equity crew in 2010. Now the card processor, a member of the FTSE 100 index these days, is worth \u00a38bn as US bidders loom. Actually, the tale isn\u2019t quite so simple. RBS was under orders to sell Worldpay as a condition of the 2008 taxpayer-funded bailout. The bank held an auction and got the best price at the time. Besides, one suspects the business would have been starved of investment if it had remained within RBS. The idea that \u00a36bn has been \u201clost\u201d to RBS is about three-quarters illusion. Can Worldpay itself resist \u00a38bn-plus offers, assuming Vantiv and JP Morgan convert their approaches into real bids? Well, it shouldn\u2019t surrender its independence without a fight. Card processing, we\u2019re told, is a business that is going global and, in that context, Worldpay has strategic value. It has 40% of the UK market and can operate in 126 currencies in 140 countries. By rights, it ought to be predator rather than prey. In the real world, investors whose Worldpay shares were worth 320p on Monday will want to look at any bid above 400p. But the directors should push hard. Card processing enjoys fat profit margins \u2013 the fees are tiny in percentage terms but add up to a big figure \u2013 and the growth of ecommerce makes the long-term outlook stable. Chairman Sir Mike Rake should not feel compelled to enter negotiations unless he thinks he can get at least 450p a share. RBS was a forced seller. Worldpay is not. Nisa business if you can get it It was the \u201cbest sales performance in years,\u201d said Sainsbury\u2019s chief executive, Mike Coupe. Really? The 2.3% like-for-like improvement in the first quarter may be the highest figure in ages but, if we\u2019re talking \u201cbest,\u201d one should adjust for the inflationary breezes now blowing through grocery-land. Sainsbury\u2019s didn\u2019t quantify the contribution from higher prices but a reasonable estimate is about 2%. If so, the first-quarter sales performance looks commendably solid \u2013 but no more so than in the periods when Sainsbury\u2019s did well to stand still when others, including Tesco, were going backwards. In the end, the spin is irrelevant. What matters more is that Argos has been digested smoothly, the store-in-store openings are happening and the eventual cost savings are still promised to be \u00a3160m. The deal now looks smart. Would a purchase of convenience store operator Nisa also fit the bill? Coupe wouldn\u2019t comment on the talks but the commercial logic looks fine. Sainsbury\u2019s would bring its buying power to the party and some of the Nisa store owners would probably improve their sales by converting their shops to Sainsbury\u2019s Locals. The objection that Nisa would be a distraction feels wrong. Supermarkets, knowing the old profits margins are never coming back, are obliged to find new tricks. Nisa, from the point of view of Sainsbury\u2019s, looks a low-risk adventure.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "When it opened the developers of the Shard boasted that it should only take \u201cabout 20 phone calls\u201d to sell the 10 exclusive apartments near the top of the tower for up to \u00a350m each. Yet five years on from the Duke of York and the former prime minister of Qatar officially opening \u201cEurope\u2019s first vertical city\u201d with a dazzling laser display on 5 July 2012, all 10 of the flats on the 53rd to 65th floors of the 72-storey building appear to remain unsold. Brochures for the apartments, which include three two-storey duplex units, boasted that on a clear day residents should be able to see the sea and the grandstands at Ascot from their new perch in the centre of the capital. The penthouse stands at 735ft, just below the entrance to the \u00a330.95-a-time public viewing deck, which attracts up to 6,000 visitors a day. Even the lowest apartment, which it was hoped would sell for \u00a330m, is higher than any home ever built in London. But the brochures are no longer available and the tower\u2019s developers and its Qatari owners are reluctant to speak about the residences, which they had boasted would be among the most luxurious in London. As well as the views and double-height entertaining space, potential residents were said to have the luxury of being able to order room service from the five-star Shangri-La hotel below, and call on its maids to turn down their beds. A \u201cback stairs\u201d service lift was shown in floorplans so meals and cleaners could be delivered directly to the apartments\u2019 kitchens. Baron Phillips, spokesman for Irvine Sellar, the recently deceased property visionary who led the development of the Shard, declined to comment about the unsold apartments. It was Phillips who told the media that several of the world\u2019s super-rich had expressed interest in buying apartments years before the building was finished and said of selling them: \u201cI should think about 20 phone calls should do it, don\u2019t you?\u201d Sellar convinced Italian architect Renzo Piano to design the Shard over lunch in Berlin in 2000, with the first designs sketched on a menu. But the project nearly collapsed in the wake of the 2007-08 financial crisis before Qatar stepped in to buy 80% of the tower. Representatives of Qatar Diar, the real estate arm of the gulf state\u2019s sovereign wealth fund, did not respond to requests for comment. A spokeswoman for Real Estate Management, the property management firm appointed to oversee the day-to-day management of the Shard, said the apartments were still \u201ccompletely empty shells\u201d. No apartment sales have been recorded by the Land Registry. Levels 53 to 65 and the apartments\u2019 exclusive entrance on the ground floor were in December 2015 leased to LBQ Four, a Jersey-registered firm believed to be part of the London Bridge Quarter, the holding company that owns the Shard. The 250-year lease valued the 10 apartments at a total of \u00a3199,250,000. Henry Pryor, a luxury property buying agent, said he was not surprised that the Shard\u2019s owners had yet to sell any of the apartments as a sale of one apartment would set a publicly recorded price and make it harder to sell the other apartments for more if and when the London ultra-prime property market improves. \u201cIf they could sell them for what they want for them they would have sold by now,\u201d he said. \u201cIf they sell they will crystallise a price and that makes it very difficult for future sales because the benchmark has been set. That is one reason developers chuck in goodies [like cars or fine wine] to keep the apparent price up.\u201d Pryor said the Shard apartments have not been able to attract prices near the record \u00a3136m paid for a flat in the Candy brothers\u2019 One Hyde Park for reasons that any avid watcher of TV property shows would know: \u201cLocation, location, location.\u201d \u201cKirstie and Phil tell us it every week, location, location, location. Rich people don\u2019t want to shell out zillions living south of the river, it\u2019s a shock enough living anywhere south of the [Hyde] park,\u201d he said. \u201cNobody knows anyone who lives south of the river.\u201d The Shard has done better at letting the lower floors for offices, although many have gone to companies owned or partially owned by Qatar. But some whole floors are still to be let, including all 29,824 sq ft of the 12th floor. The University of Warwick\u2019s business school has rented level 17 and fitted it out with a lecture theatre with perhaps the best student view in the world.",

That is one reason developers chuck in goodies [like cars or fine wine] to keep the apparent price up.\u201d</p> <p>Pryor said the Shard apartments have not been able to attract prices near the record \u00a3136m paid for a flat in the Candy brothers\u2019 One Hyde Park for reasons that any avid watcher of TV property shows would know: \u201cLocation, location, location.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cKirstie and Phil tell us it every week, location, location, location. Rich people don\u2019t want to shell out zillions living south of the river, it\u2019s a shock enough living anywhere south of the [Hyde] park,\u201d he said. \u201cNobody knows anyone who lives south of the river.\u201d </p> <p>The Shard has done better at letting the lower floors for offices, although many have gone to companies owned or partially owned by Qatar. But some whole floors are still to be let, including all 29,824 sq ft of the 12th floor. </p> <p>The University of Warwick\u2019s business school has rented level 17 and fitted it out with <a href=\"https://www.the-shard.com/news/warwick-business-school-shard/\">a lecture theatre with perhaps the best student view in the world</a>.<br></p>",
