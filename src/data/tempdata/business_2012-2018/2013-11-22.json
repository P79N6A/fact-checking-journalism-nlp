      "bodyText": "It is May 2010 at Monaco's vast Le Sporting banquet hall, where 800 guests have responded to an invitation from one of central Asia's most powerful, and secretive, oligarchs. The host has packed the venue's gardens with white roses and arranged for entertainment from the singer Jennifer Lopez and French DJ David Guetta. Several guests execute an impromptu lezginka, a traditional dance from the Caucasus, and a crowd forms to shower them with $100 and \u20ac100 bills, a sign of the donors' respect, which is then paid to the musicians. The grand celebrations have been arranged to mark the wedding of one Sabir Chodiev, the son of Patokh Chodiev, 60, an Uzbek businessman whose then \u00a31.85bn fortune had largely been secured with two Kyrgyz business partners in resource-rich Kazakhstan. The timing of the wedding just about coincided with the zenith of the worldwide boom in commodity prices and the whole event is estimated to have cost Chodiev around \u00a36m, a fifth of which went on Lopez's one-hour turn. Those were better times in the world of Patokh Chodiev \u2013 plus his two business partners, Alexander Machkevitch, 59, and Alijan Ibragimov, 60 \u2013 a trio who largely became known in the City because of their links to a painful hit to many UK savers' pension pots. After floating their mining company, Eurasian Natural Resources Corporation (ENRC), on the London Stock Exchange in 2007, the company's shares were quickly propelled into the FTSE 100 and, therefore, into many British pension funds. But the past two years have seen persistent allegations of corruption against the company, along with a string of corporate governance rows, and the shares have crashed, prompting the trio to take the company private again. When the stock market closed on Friday evening the shares, which have fallen by 85% from their peak, were traded publicly for the last time. So is London bidding farewell to the trio, whose company was dubbed \"more Soviet than City\" by Ken Olisa, a former non-executive director who was ousted by the three founders? Probably not. ENRC may be disappearing from the London Stock Exchange, but the professional and personal lives of the tycoons link them inextricably to the UK. One of their main businesses, private firm International Mineral Resources (IMR), is run out of London, several of their legal scraps are still being fought here, while ENRC continues to be investigated by the Serious Fraud Office for \"fraud, bribery and corruption\". Lavish properties in the most exclusive parts of the capital continue to be owned by the businessmen, while among the diverse collection of London names touched by the oligarchs are Miriam Gonzalez, the lawyer and wife of deputy prime minister Nick Clegg; the steel billionaire Lakshmi Mittal; and the British artist Damien Hirst. The tycoons' partnership was conceived in Kyrgyzstan, one of central Asia's poorest countries to the south of Kazakhstan, where Machkevitch and Ibragimov grew up. The pair are thought to have met at a wedding in 1971 but pursued separate careers, as Chodiev worked in Japan for the Soviet ministry of foreign trade. But by the late 1980s, in a move that has never been explained, they came together during the early stages of perestroika. Machkevitch and Ibragimov are believed to have moved to Moscow in 1987 to trade everything from scrap metal to iron ore, aluminium and oil. Chodiev joined them two years later, with much of the trio's business being conducted in Kazakhstan, a market they knew well. From there, they gained control of newly privatised chromium, alumina, and gas operations in Kazakhstan, creating partnerships (and eventually feuds) with some of the pioneers of early post-Soviet capitalism, including the London-based Reuben brothers and the metals trader Lev Chernoy. Quite how this transformation was achieved remains unclear. Observers of the period say anybody could succeed in Kazakh business if they enjoyed powerful sponsorship, which explains the tales of alleged sweetheart deals with Kazakhstan's president, Nursultan Nazarbayev, and of charging \"special commissions\" to the Mayfair-based Mittal for acting as intermediaries to the Kazakh elite. A spokesman for the trio would not comment on the payments, while Mittal's spokeswoman has denied the payment was a commission. What is known for certain, however, is that from the chaos of the 1990s, the trio grew a substantial business, part of which became ENRC. But by the time that company floated in 2007, some of their wealth had already arrived in Mayfair. In 2005 a British Virgin Islands-based company associated with Machkevitch paid \u00a314.5m for a palatial three-storey Georgian mansion in one of London's most opulent squares. Five years earlier, Chodiev bought his \u00a310m penthouse in a glass-fronted development near London's Vauxhall Bridge, that boasts a 24 hour concierge service, residents' gym and secure underground car park. Two Mayfair properties are registered to a company run by Chodiev's daughter Mounissa Chodieva, head of ENRC's investor relations. A two-mile stroll north to Portman Square brings you to the offices of Amre Youness, who runs the trio's private mining business IMR. Youness has married into the Heinz family, and so is related by marriage to US secretary of state John Kerry. But despite his high-level links, IMR's private status has meant the company has been far less visible than ENRC. Even so, the firm has attracted controversy. It sold ENRC a business that the listed company's former lawyers say may have made \"cash payments to African presidents\", while IMR is accused in the Dutch courts of \"blatant fraud, exacerbated by bribery\" by Russian fertiliser group EuroChem. IMR denies the accusations. ENRC and the trio deny all allegations of bribery and corruption. Meanwhile, the oligarchs are furious at how they believe they have been treated by the City, arguing they have spent millions on lawyers and bankers in order to meet London compliance standards, only for their shares to slump. One close associate says: \"They've been mugged by the City.\" That anger is being played out against Dechert, the law firm that raised the allegations about payments in Africa, which ENRC is suing for allegedly overcharging for an internal corruption investigation. The lawsuit names Clegg's wife, Gonzalez, who worked on the project. Dechert did not comment. That case follows ENRC's pursuit of its former director, the City grandee Sir Paul Judge, who it accuses of leaking company information to the media. Judge denies this and is suing for libel. Meanwhile, potentially embarrassing details about the tycoons and their families are set to be aired elsewhere in London's high court, as ENRC's former head of corporate finance, Kirill Stein, is suing the trio for \u00a317m in bonuses and interest he says they reneged on paying. Stein also names as defendants three of the oligarchs' children \u2013 Chodieva, Alla Machkevitch and Dostan Ibragimov \u2013 all of whom have London connections. Alla, along with her sister Anna, is a director of the London-based Machkevitch Foundation. Anna is said to be one of the largest collectors of Damien Hirst: she has acquired pieces including butterfly wing mosaics, cabinets of manufactured diamonds and the signature Hirst \"dots\". All of which means that \u2013 for now \u2013 London and the trio remain bound.",

He will remain chief executive of Ryanair, so presumably will have to talk semi-publicly to his shareholders. But the days of the \"cheeky chappie\" and politically incorrect press conferences are over, he says. Seriousness is the new watchword for Ryanair as it tries to attract more business customers and O'Leary judges his own image has become a problem. \"I'm getting in the way of the brand stuff,\" he told this newspaper this week. A recent Newsnight interview with Kirsty Wark, when he was tackled on sexism, was the last straw, apparently. As ever with O'Leary, believe it when you see it, or not. If Ryanair's makeover succeeds in wresting momentum away from easyJet, he will surely want to declare victory personally and very loudly. Retailers Famous old Tesco directors never go away, they just resurface at smaller retailers. Tim Mason, Tesco's former marketing guru, led Bonmarch\u00e9, the discount womenswear chain, to a stock market listing this week as its chairman. Andy Higginson, the supermarket group's former finance director, has the same job at Poundland, a company tipped for float next year. And former Tesco chief executive Sir Terry Leahy is a backer of online retailer The Hut, another firm muttering about a 2014 flotation. It's all a far cry from adventures, and misadventures, in big-time grocery land. But if Bonmarch\u00e9, Poundland and The Hut can refrain from declaring war on Walmart on US turf, these minnows may be worth watching.",

The mutualisation movement probably reached its zenith when it called for Northern Rock to be remutualised, and&#xa0;the Co-op Bank itself spread its wings to seek control of the Britannia building society and then Lloyds branches.</p> <p>Such was the favourable intellectual climate that before the 2010 election, David Cameron set up a Conservative co-operative movement in conjunction with Jesse Norman, the early adopter on the Tory backbenches of the \"big society\". The Conservative movement may have been little more than some PR modernisation gloss by Cameron before the election, but it is significant that he felt the need to show his support.</p> <p>At the same time, there has been a financial nexus between Labour and the Co-op Bank, and the Co-op Group, the broader arm of the Co-operative including its shops. By some accounts, Labour has been able to call on \u00a334m in cheap loans over the past 20 years.</p> <p>The loans have always acted as security for Labour as its income has ebbed and flowed during election periods. Separately the Co-op Group has been an indirect provider of gifts to Labour. In 2012 the Co-op Group gave the Co-op Party \u00a3800,000 to help fund Labour MPs and its organisation. Ed Balls, probably the most prominent supporter of the Co-op movement on the Labour front bench, was also given \u00a350,000 to fund one of his policy researchers, support declared in the register of members' interests.</p> <p>But Balls and Miliband are absolutely clear that they had no knowledge of the alleged personal failings of Flowers or his inadequacy to run a bank of this size. They argue that they led a political party, and did not act as surrogate bank regulators.</p> <p>The worry for Labour is that if the finances of the Co-op Bank are such that they become totally dependent on the goodwill of two American hedge funds,&#xa0;the instinctive century old sympathy between the party and the bank will dissipate, and along with it some of the soft loans. At a time when&#xa0;the union-party relationship may lead to a rapid reduction in union funding, this lack of sympathy could prove fatal.</p> <p>When the Rochdale Pioneers and the early Co-operators started their work, they did not imagine that they would be working alongside US-based hedge funds Aurelius Capital and Silver Point Capital.</p> <p>If there is blame to be attached it will be to a party that for decent wider public policy motives saw the Co-op Bank as an ideal vehicle to challenge the big four banks, but did not do enough to question whether the bank had the financial resources or management acumen to be the David to take on these Goliaths. Neither, does it seem, did the financial regulators take the trouble to probe what lay underneath the veneer of ethical banking, just as they failed to question whether Northern Rock was a viable proposition.</p>",

Proposals for the mutualisation of British Waterways, the BBC Trust and the Rail network have all been promoted in the 2010 Labour manifesto or by prominent figures such as Tessa Jowell and David Miliband. Similarly, Labour spokesmen have looked favourably on the community ownership of pubs and football grounds, co-operative trust schools, energy co-ops, and housing co-operatives. The mutualisation movement probably reached its zenith when it called for Northern Rock to be remutualised, and the Co-op Bank itself spread its wings to seek control of the Britannia building society and then Lloyds branches. Such was the favourable intellectual climate that before the 2010 election, David Cameron set up a Conservative co-operative movement in conjunction with Jesse Norman, the early adopter on the Tory backbenches of the \"big society\". The Conservative movement may have been little more than some PR modernisation gloss by Cameron before the election, but it is significant that he felt the need to show his support. At the same time, there has been a financial nexus between Labour and the Co-op Bank, and the Co-op Group, the broader arm of the Co-operative including its shops. By some accounts, Labour has been able to call on \u00a334m in cheap loans over the past 20 years. The loans have always acted as security for Labour as its income has ebbed and flowed during election periods. Separately the Co-op Group has been an indirect provider of gifts to Labour. In 2012 the Co-op Group gave the Co-op Party \u00a3800,000 to help fund Labour MPs and its organisation. Ed Balls, probably the most prominent supporter of the Co-op movement on the Labour front bench, was also given \u00a350,000 to fund one of his policy researchers, support declared in the register of members' interests. But Balls and Miliband are absolutely clear that they had no knowledge of the alleged personal failings of Flowers or his inadequacy to run a bank of this size. They argue that they led a political party, and did not act as surrogate bank regulators. The worry for Labour is that if the finances of the Co-op Bank are such that they become totally dependent on the goodwill of two American hedge funds, the instinctive century old sympathy between the party and the bank will dissipate, and along with it some of the soft loans. At a time when the union-party relationship may lead to a rapid reduction in union funding, this lack of sympathy could prove fatal. When the Rochdale Pioneers and the early Co-operators started their work, they did not imagine that they would be working alongside US-based hedge funds Aurelius Capital and Silver Point Capital. If there is blame to be attached it will be to a party that for decent wider public policy motives saw the Co-op Bank as an ideal vehicle to challenge the big four banks, but did not do enough to question whether the bank had the financial resources or management acumen to be the David to take on these Goliaths. Neither, does it seem, did the financial regulators take the trouble to probe what lay underneath the veneer of ethical banking, just as they failed to question whether Northern Rock was a viable proposition.",

    "webTitle": "Ikea's online expansion helps boost sales by 3.1%", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Ikea has consolidated its flatpacked grip on British households with increased sales and market share, bolted on by its expanding online shopping, the Swedish group has announced. Sales rose 3.1% to \u00a31.27bn for the financial year to August, with a 29% leap in online sales, which allowed the world's biggest home furnishings store to reach new demographics. Last year IKEA increased to around 80% the extent of its product range available online, and spread its home deliveries to cover most regions of Britain. In its 25th anniversary year in the UK, Ikea increased its leading market share in home furnishings by 0.2% to 6.4%. The sales figures reflect similar rises across the global group, where revenues reached \u20ac27.9bn across 26 countries. Gillian Drakeford, Ikea's UK retail manager, said: \"With the continued uncertainty around the recovery from the recession, we have continued to invest across our online and in-store shopping channels to create a simpler, more convenient and enjoyable experience and it's very humbling that our efforts have resulted in another year of growth.\" Outdoor furniture saw the biggest leap in sales, up 58%, with stores now making the product range available throughout the year despite Britain's uncertain seasons. Sales in lighting also rose due to a push towards LED bulbs. The company, established 70 years ago in Sweden, reached Britain in 1987 with its first store in Warrington. It now has 18 mammoth stores across the UK, its semi-warehouse model effecting a mass conversion of the country to DIY home furnishing and Scandinavian interior design at relatively cheap prices. Profits for the year have not yet been disclosed and will be published in Ikea's annual report in January. Last year, profits dipped to just under \u00a320m in Britain, which was its worst results for three years. However, Drakeford said the market outlook in the medium term and Ikea's investment \"to improve the shopping experience\" should see it double its turnover and total market share by 2020. Ikea UK is planning to focus in the coming year on selling more kitchens, by investing \u00a38m in rebuilding its showrooms and improving delivery and installation services. The firm will also be investing in energy-saving products and other environmental initiatives, including ranges designed to help customers save water, cut waste and save money. Solar panels will be sold in all stores by the end of this year and schemes promoted to encourage customers to recycle furniture at the store. Drakeford said her team had put a renewed focus on trying to understand how their customers live and shop, as well as \"their needs, dreams and wants in the home\". This involved making more than 500 visits to customers' homes to see how they lived. The picture is happier for Ikea this side of the Channel than in France, where three of its senior management team are being investigated by police over more unorthodox methods of research. Executives, including the chief executive of Ikea France, are accused of employing private detectives to snoop on staff and customers, with union activists and job applicants among those targeted.",

Last year IKEA increased to around 80% the extent of its product range available online, and spread its home deliveries to cover most regions of Britain.</p> <p>In its 25th anniversary year in the UK, Ikea increased its leading market share in home furnishings by 0.2% to 6.4%. The sales figures reflect similar rises across the global group, where revenues reached \u20ac27.9bn across 26 countries.</p> <p>Gillian Drakeford, Ikea's UK retail manager, said: \"With the continued uncertainty around the recovery from the recession, we have continued to invest across our online and in-store shopping channels to create a simpler, more convenient and enjoyable experience and it's very humbling that our efforts have resulted in another year of growth.\"</p> <p>Outdoor furniture saw the biggest leap in sales, up 58%, with stores now making the product range available throughout the year despite Britain's uncertain seasons. Sales in lighting also rose due to a push towards LED bulbs.</p> <p>The company, established 70 years ago in Sweden, reached Britain in 1987 with its first store in Warrington. It now has 18 mammoth stores across the UK, its semi-warehouse model effecting a mass conversion of the country to DIY home furnishing and Scandinavian interior design at relatively cheap prices.</p> <p>Profits for the year have not yet been disclosed and will be published in Ikea's annual report in January. Last year, profits dipped to just under \u00a320m in Britain, which was its worst results for three years.</p> <p>However, Drakeford said the market outlook in the medium term and Ikea's investment \"to improve the shopping experience\" should see it double its turnover and total market share by 2020.</p> <p>Ikea UK is planning to focus in the coming year on selling more kitchens, by investing \u00a38m in rebuilding its showrooms and improving delivery and installation services.</p> <p>The firm will also be investing in energy-saving products and other environmental initiatives, including ranges designed to help customers save water, cut waste and save money.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The closure of Pfizer's research and development site in Kent signalled a dramatic downturn in spending during 2012 by the pharmaceutical industry and the first fall in the UK's overall R&amp;D spending since the financial crash. According to official estimates, pharmaceutical firms cut their R&amp;D spending by 15% in 2012 while defence contractors sliced 10% from their spending on research into new manufacturing processes and equipment. The total R&amp;D spend fell 4% in constant prices from a year earlier to \u00a317.1bn as the economy flatlined and businesses faced the prospect of a triple-dip recession. According to the Office for National Statistics, manufacturing companies maintained a steady increase in spending after a dip that followed the recession in 2009, though much of this investment was by foreign businesses, including the major carmakers. Foreign-owned businesses accounted for 51% of UK R&amp;D. The fall in spending is likely to have long-term implications for Britain, especially its reliance on pharmaceutical research. Sandwich in Kent, where Pfizer employed 2,400 people, has struggled to recover from the loss of so many high-grade jobs, and now ranks as one of the more deprived areas in Britain. GlaxoSmithKline remains a significant investor in UK research facilities and is a major recipient of EU research funding. In 2012, Britain received the largest slice of EU R&amp;D funding, with much of it going to the pharmaceutical industry. However, the UK's commitment to private sector R&amp;D remains low compared with many of its competitors at 1.1% of GDP. According to figures from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), R&amp;D by public and private organisations accounted for 1.77% of UK GDP in 2011, well below 3.37% in Sweden, 2.84% in Germany and 2.25% in France. The EU average was 1.94%. Successive governments have attempted to lift R&amp;D spending through a system of generous tax reliefs. Small and medium-sized businesses can claim tax relief on their research costs of 225% compared with large companies, which can claim 130%, though neither benefit has raised spending levels significantly. The ONS said earlier this year in a report on international variations that \"the business enterprise component of R&amp;D expenditure in the UK is low by international standards, even after adjusting for structural difference between countries. It is also concentrated in the hands of a few very large firms and the small number of industrial sectors in which they are based.\" Steve Radley, director of policy at EEF, the manufacturers' organisation, said: \"The data is a clear reminder that the UK has some way to go to catch up with our international competitors. \"The fall in expenditure does follow a strong increase in 2011, and the latest figures show pockets of strong growth in sectors such as motor vehicles. However, the key message for government is that it needs to build on the strong policy foundations it has put in place and be ambitious to drive up sustained increases in R&amp;D spending.\" The ONS said employment in R&amp;D has remained relatively stable in recent years. \"The lowest level in the last decade occurred in 2005, when 146,000 FTE were employed, while the highest level [160,000] was reached in 2011,\" it said.",

According to Reuters:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The loans would be part of so-called contractual arrangements, which would be legally binding contracts with economic reform targets and macroeconomic milestones that trigger the payout of tranches of the agreed loan.</p> <p>The loans would be attractive because they would carry an interest rate lower than the one a government could get on the market. In that respect, it would amount to a degree of subsidized lending, ultimately amounting to a mutualizing of risk among involved member states and a degree of financial transfer - an idea that Germany has long resisted.</p> <p>To qualify, countries would have to draw up legally binding plans for reforms that would then be approved by other eurozone states. The conditionality would come on top of other macroeconomic programs such as the Stability and Growth Pact and the eurozone's new budgetary oversight powers.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>The full story is here:</strong></p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/11/22/us-eurozone-reforms-idUSBRE9AL0OB20131122?feedType=RSS&amp;feedName=businessNews\">Euro zone mulls cheap loans as incentive for economic reforms - document</a></h2> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2013-11-22T16:36:02.727Z\">at 4.36pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-528f78e0e4b0ae67c83cc660\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-11-22T15:38:48.963Z\">3.38pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>US markets are moving higher but are a little hesistent after Thursday's record close for the Dow Jones Industrial Average above 16,000.</strong></p> <p>The Dow is currently virtually unchanged, up just 4.9 points, after drifting in and out of negative territory.

Furthermore, private consumption will continue to be a very reliable source of demand during the next few quarters, based on ongoing robust increases in disposable income, recent inflation softening, and persistently reassuring labour market developments. Consumer confidence consequently remains on an upward trend. In addition, housing construction will remain strong due to very low interest rates and a lot of pent-up demand. The ECB is expected to keep monetary policy very soft throughout 2014, so that financing conditions will remain favourable in Germany for quite some time to come. In addition, it needs to be kept in mind that the euro, despite having strengthened modestly during the past 12 months, is still at quite competitive levels for Germany's export industry.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-528f6459e4b0ae67c83cc651\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-11-22T14:10:45.221Z\">2.10pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Computer keyboards will be ringing out this Christmas as 12% of shopping using plastic cards is done online.</strong></p> <p>Including cash, cheques and cards, we will spend \u00a382.7 billion in December, according to the <a href=\"http://www.paymentscouncil.org.uk/\">Payments Council</a>.

And on that note it's time to end for the day and indeed the week. Thanks for all your comments, and we'll be back on Monday. Have a good weekend. Over in Greece talks today between prime minister Antonis Samaras and the German chancellor Angela Merkel have been causing a stir with the main opposition leader excoriating the leader for flying all the way to Berlin \u201cto beg for the sympathy\u201d of Europe\u2019s most powerful politician. Helena Smith writes from Athens: For all of Antonis Samaras\u2019 insistence in talks with Angela Merkel today that the Greek economy is on the road to recovery, on the ground it feels anything but that. And, true to form, the country\u2019s vehemently anti-austerity main opposition leader, Alexis Tsipras, made most of it during a spirited speech in parliament. Flatly rejecting the idea that the beleagered prime minister had flown to Berlin to negotiate with his German partner, the radical leftist argued that Samaras had made the journey \u201cto convey\u201d hard-hitting decisions that had already been taken. \u201cThere is no negotiation. Let\u2019s not kid ourselves. We have a prime minister who today will meet Mrs Merkel to beg her to feel sorry for him by conveying decisions that have already been taken for more hardship and new measures after the [May] euro-elections,\u201d he told the 300-seat House. \u201cAnd his only argument [will be] feel sorry for us because Syriza will come,\u201d he said referring to the ascent of his party in the polls. \u2018That is the prime minister\u2019s argument and I don\u2019t know if Mrs Merkel will feel sorry for him. What I do know, however, is that he is lamentable.\u201d Although Samaras wins hands down in the perception of the public as the best prime minister the debt-stricken country could have, Syriza has held a constant, if marginal, lead in opinion polls since the coalition government assumed power 19 months ago. Tsipras is widely seen as a prime minister in waiting with his support expected to grow if, as seems likely, fresh belt-tightening measures are enforced to plug a budget black hole that Greece\u2019s foreign creditors project at almost \u20ac3bn next year. Although the leftist has toned down his rhetoric the government argues the country would be destroyed \u2013 and almost certainly exit the eurozone \u2013 if he assumes power. The German finance minister Wolfgang Schauble, turning up the heat on Athens, reiterated this afternoon that Greece counts on Germany\u2019s ongoing support if it \u201ckept to its commitments\u201d laid down in the bailout agreement it has signed with creditors and implemented reforms. An (unenthusiastic) comment on the eurozone loans to governments story from Megan Greene, chief economist at Maverick Intelligence: The UK Treasury has said regulators have agreed to hold an independent inquiry into the Co-op Bank. This will cover the period from 2008 to the present, and will start once any enforcement action is taken. Here are the Reuters snaps: 16:13 - UK TREASURY SAYS REGULATORS HAVE AGREED TO HOLD AN INDEPENDENT INQUIRY INTO CO-OP BANK 16:13 - CO-OP INQUIRY TO BE LED BY INDEPENDENT PERSON TO BE APPOINTED BY REGULATORS, APPROVED BY UK TREASURY 16:14 - UK TREASURY SAYS REGULATORS CONSIDERING WHETHER TO LAUNCH ENFORCEMENT ACTION AGAINST CO-OP BANK 16:15 - UK TREASURY SAYS INQUIRY TO COVER PERIOD FROM 2008 TO PRESENT, WILL START ONCE ANY ENFORCEMENT ACTION TAKEN And here's the Treasury announcement. Eurozone governments may offer cheap loans to governments as incentives for structural reforms, according to Reuters. The loans would be legally binding contracts with economic reform targets and milestones to trigger payments, says a document seen by the news agency. It will be discussed next week ahead of the next EU summit on December 19 and 20. According to Reuters: The loans would be part of so-called contractual arrangements, which would be legally binding contracts with economic reform targets and macroeconomic milestones that trigger the payout of tranches of the agreed loan. The loans would be attractive because they would carry an interest rate lower than the one a government could get on the market. In that respect, it would amount to a degree of subsidized lending, ultimately amounting to a mutualizing of risk among involved member states and a degree of financial transfer - an idea that Germany has long resisted. To qualify, countries would have to draw up legally binding plans for reforms that would then be approved by other eurozone states. The conditionality would come on top of other macroeconomic programs such as the Stability and Growth Pact and the eurozone's new budgetary oversight powers. The full story is here: Euro zone mulls cheap loans as incentive for economic reforms - document US markets are moving higher but are a little hesistent after Thursday's record close for the Dow Jones Industrial Average above 16,000. The Dow is currently virtually unchanged, up just 4.9 points, after drifting in and out of negative territory. European markets are similarly unsure which direction to take. The job opening numbers (below) could provide a little more ammunition for the US Federal Reserve to begin tapering its $85bn a month bond buying programme. But Fed members are continuing to send mixed signals. Denis Lockhart, president of the Atlanta Federal Reserve but not a voting member of the rate setting committee, told CNBC that debate over reducing the pace of the bond buying programme would be on the table at December's Fed meeting. Most observers still believe the Fed will not make any changes until next year. Lockhart said he expected the exit from the QE programme would be manageable whenever it came. Meanwhile in Europe, German and French markets are still in positive territory although the FTSE 100 has dipped arounf 4 points. The Jolts are in. There were 3.9 million job openings in the United States in September, a slight increase on August and 310,000 more than in September 2012, according to the Jolts employment survey. Janet Yellen, incoming head of America's Federal Reserve, reportedly pays close attention to the data, produced by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, and it will inform decisions about when to begin tapering quantitative easing. The number of job openings decreased in arts, entertainment, and recreation and was little changed in all remaining industries and in all four regions. The number of hires was 4.6m in September, a slight increase on August but steadily ahead of 2012. The total number of separations, which include staff quitting, being laid off and being discharged, was 4.426m, up from 4.405m in August and more than the 4.025m in September 2012. And with that, I'm handing over to my colleague Nick Fletcher. Ireland's finance minister has defended his decision to exit a stringent three year bailout programme without the backstop of a precautionary credit facilit from Europe. Arriving for the Extraordinary Eurogroup meeting in Brussles, Michael Noonan said: I took advice nationally and internationally...it was a finely balanced decision...I'm convinced we did the right thing...There has been no negative reaction from the rating agencies...We are going through quite a benign period. All the vital statistics in Ireland are very positive: 3,000 jobs a month being created, tax take for the first three months of the year is ahead of what we predicted last year, and Europe is going through a benign period as well. There is no sign of any particular crisis in the eurozone, and so it's a good period. Asked about market reaction to Ireland's decision to proceed without a safety cushion, Noonan said the \"tangible\" evidence was that Allied Irish Banks and Permanent TSB bank had each raised \u20ac500m in the money markets at low interest rates, and in heavily oversubscribed placements. German GDP growth will be 0.6% in 2013 and 1.8% in both 2014 and 2015, IHS Global Insight predicts. The predictions were made today following encouraging economic data from Germany. IHS senior economist Timo Klein has this to say: German near-term economic recovery prospects appear well underpinned. The Eurozone debt crisis is increasingly losing its restraining effect on investment, based on waning uncertainty levels along with economic stabilization in several of the particularly troubled Eurozone countries of recent times. Furthermore, private consumption will continue to be a very reliable source of demand during the next few quarters, based on ongoing robust increases in disposable income, recent inflation softening, and persistently reassuring labour market developments. Consumer confidence consequently remains on an upward trend. In addition, housing construction will remain strong due to very low interest rates and a lot of pent-up demand. The ECB is expected to keep monetary policy very soft throughout 2014, so that financing conditions will remain favourable in Germany for quite some time to come. In addition, it needs to be kept in mind that the euro, despite having strengthened modestly during the past 12 months, is still at quite competitive levels for Germany's export industry. Computer keyboards will be ringing out this Christmas as 12% of shopping using plastic cards is done online. Including cash, cheques and cards, we will spend \u00a382.7 billion in December, according to the Payments Council. A total of \u00a310bn will be spent using plastic cards online. Debt conscious consumers will increase their spending on debit cards to \u00a334bn, up 6.3%, while spend on credit cards will go up just 1.4% to \u00a314bn. Cash spending will remain flat at \u00a324bn, while cheques will account for \u00a310.5bn of purchases, 11% less than last year. China and Europe are to open talks on a landmark trade treaty, which will tackle the thorny issue of Chinese protection for state owned enterprises. Foreign companies are barred from trading in many key sectors in China, but China's premier, Li Keqiang, said the two parties had \u201cagreed to keep our markets open to each other and oppose protectionism\u201d. The announcement came at the end of a summit in Beijing attended by Li, European Council president Herman Van Rompuy, and European Commission president Jos\u00e9 Manuel Barroso on Thursday. They agreed to increase bilateral trade from $580m in 2012 to $1 trillion by 2020. EU trade commissioner Karel De Gucht said talks would begin in a matter of weeks but experts believe they could last several years. De Gucht said: It will certainly not be an easy negotiation...It depends, I believe, also on where [China's] economy is going in the coming years...From that it will depend on which sectors they are ready to open for investment. To put a date on that is pure speculation. Europe is China's biggest export market, and China is Europe's second biggest export market after the United States. Some snaps from the meeting between German chancellor Angela Merkel and the Greek prime minister Antonis Samaras, courtesy Reuters: 12:25 - MERKEL SAYS VISITING GREEK PM SAMARAS TOLD HER GREECE WILL MEET FULLY ITS COMMITMENTS TO THE TROIKA 12:28 - BERLIN-GREEK PM SAMARAS SAYS WILL CONTINUE REFORM EFFORTS, SEES LIGHT AT END OF TUNNEL 12:33 - SAMARAS SAYS OPTIMISTIC WILL GET A DEAL WITH TROIKA SOON 12:35 - MERKEL SAYS GREECE NEEDS TO IMPLEMENT REFORM PLEDGES IN ORDER FOR NEXT TRANCHE OF AID TO BE PAID OUT 12:36 - SAMARAS SAYS DOES NOT SEE FINANCING HOLE IN CURRENT AID PROGRAMME FOR GREECE 12:37 - SAMARAS SAYS GREECE IS NOT ASKING FOR ANY ADDITIONAL AID ON TOP OF WHAT ALREADY AGREED The commission has not yet named the companies involved, but described the behaviour it was investigating in a release today: Since 2009, these companies have been making regular public announcements of price increase intentions through press releases on their websites and in the specialised trade press. These announcements are made several times a year and contain the amount of increase and the date of implementation, which is generally similar for all announcing companies. The announcements are usually made by the companies successively a few weeks before the announced implementation date. Investigators say the practice may allow companies to signal future price intentions to each other, and so harm competition and customers by ramping up prices on routes to and from Europe. The European commission has launched anti-trust proceedings against container shipping companies. Ryanair shares are up nearly 1% this morning after the airline's chief executive Michael O'Leary revealed he is to step back from the publicity frontline. \"I'm getting in the way of the brand stuff,\" O'Leary told the Guardian's transport correspondent Gwyn Topham, who writes: Ryanair is in the process of appointing a new director of sales and marketing, to start when O'Leary's deputy, Michael Cawley, leaves in March. That new director will front press conferences and publicity, almost certainly spelling an end to headlines such as pay-to-pee, charging heavier passengers more or shooting environmentalists. As the latest move in his efforts to make the Bank of England look less like a dusty Oxbridge college and more like a twenty-first century corporation, Mark Carney has announced three new appointments to the executive board in charge of the day-to-day running of the 319 year old institution. Jo Place will be executive director, human resources; Andrew Gracie, already in charge of the Special Resolution Unit, which will tackle bust banks in future, has been given a seat on the board, and the recently-appointed John Finch, formerly of Experian, will take his place at the table glorying in the grandiose title of Chief Information Officer and Executive Director, Information Service and Technology. Two of the three - Place and Gracie - have spent much of their careers at the Bank, so their arrival on the board can hardly be described as bringing in fresh blood. But with management consultants McKinsey already scrutinising the Bank's strategy, today's appointments are another signal that Carney, and his right-hand woman Charlotte Hogg, are determined to slicken up life in Threadneedle Street. Luxembourg, Cyprus, the British Virgin Island and the Seychelles are among the tax havens named and shamed in an influential transparency report. An international team of examiners at the global forum on transparency, which is organised by the OECD think tank, is rating countries according to the obstacles they riase to tracking down tax cheats. The forum unveiled its findings at a meeting of more than 80 countries in Jakarta, Vanessa Houlder reports for the Financial Times. Each country has been rated on whether it enacts and enforces transparency legislation, and the index could be used to by tax authorities and development banks to blacklist particular tax havens. Switzerland also rated poorly, as were Botswana, Brunei, Nauru, Panama, United Arab Emirates, Liberia and Vanuatu. Janet Yellen, incoming head of America's Federal Reserve, will be keeping a close eye on one particular set of economic indicators published later today, according to Business Insider's Joe Weisenthal. The JOLTS - Job Opening And Labor Turnover Survey - is due at 3pm GMT (10am Eastern Time), and gives an arguably fuller picture of the jobs market than the more traditional Non-Farm Payrolls data. Because JOLT looks at both posts advertised and people who are leaving their jobs, it can detect structural unemployment, which happens when employers have posts they cannot fill, for example because of skills shortages. In what may very well be a first for the Guardian business blog, I'll report the numbers when they are published this afternoon. City regulators the Financial Conduct Authority and the Financial Reporting Council are asking questions about the Co-operative Bank's financial reporting. News of the inquiries has been splashed across the media this morning, but it was first unearthed more than two weeks ago by the Guardian's City editor Jill Treanor. The details were disclosed in legal warnings published alongside details of the bank's \u00a31.5 billion rescue deal. The bank said at the time that the enquiries were at a preliminary stage and that it could not determine if a formal investigation might begin. Separately, on Wednesday, David Cameron promised two full independent probes. The Financial Conduct Authority will lead an enforcement inquiry into the conduct of Flowers and the bank, which could result in a personal censure or fine. The second is likely to be conducted by the Prudential Regulation Authority and will look at the bank's ill-judged expansion and the failure of the City regulators and the bank's board to foresee the dangers. More information on these inquiries could come today. German business confidence is recovering fast, with the leading Ifo indicator rebounding beyond expectations. The headline Ifo reached 109.3 in November, its highest level since April 2012, rising from 107.4 in October. Both current assessment and expectations improved, with the latter at its highest level since April 2011. Heralding the \"return of the island of happiness\", a metaphor used to describe Germany's outperformance in Europe, Carsten Brzeski at ING Bank said the German economy is \"cruising along smoothly\", adding \"Growth in the last two quarters was partly affected by one-offs and the economy\u2019s real strength is probably somewhere in between\". Hans-Werner Sinn, president of the Ifo Institute, said: After falling in October, the Ifo Business Climate Indicator for the German service sector returned to September\u2019s level. Service providers are slightly more satisfied with their current business situation. They are much more optimistic about future business developments and plan to recruit additional staff. Annalisa Piazza at Newedge Strategy, who had predicted a maximum overall score of 107.6 for November, said of the two point beat: today's outcome shows a quite broad-based recovery. The manufacturing diffusion index rose 4 points to 15 and trade (wholesale and retail) indices also posted a solid rebound over the month, paving the way to a general improvement in activity going forward. In a nutshell, the German Ifo has unexpectedly posted a sharp acceleration movement in November and it continues its underlying upward trend, which is consistent with a progressive improvement of the economy.

The Methodist minister, who has been suspended by the church, was taken into custody on Thursday night by West Yorkshire police after being caught on video allegedly buying cocaine. Trader Nicola Duke had this to on the law enforcement approach to banking Good morning and welcome to our rolling coverage of events across the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and the business world. European markets are marking an upbeat end to the week, after the Dow set a new record on Thursday, closing above 16,000 for the first time ever. Shaking three days of jitters over the prospect of a December start to the tapering of the Federal Reserve's quantitative easing programme, America recovered after the latest indication that unemployment is abating. The FTSE100 is up 0.26% to 6699, with Germany and French stocks also marking modest gains in early trades. The positive sentiment in Europe was underscored by solid data on German GDP. The economy grew by 0.3% in the htird quarter, bringing growth for the year to 1.1%, despite a fall in net exports. Angela Merkel and the Greek prime minister Antonis Samaras are due to meet for an update in Berlin today. The German Chancellor on Thursday kicked off the latest round of mutual admiration between the two heads of state by underlining Greece's progress in achieving \"very noteworthy reforms\". Despite the warm words, no resolution is expected yet on the country's stalled discussions with the troika ove rthe size of its fiscal gap next year and the hoops Athens will have to jump through to secure further funding. Samaras is also expected to argue for a lightening of Greece's debt burden. EU finance ministers are meeting today and are likely to chew over Italy and Spain's budgetary plans after both countries submitted optimistic predictions for 2014.",

      "bodyText": "Moritz Erhardt, the 21-year-old Bank of America Merrill Lynch intern who was found dead in a shower at his London flat after working for 72 hours in a row, died of an epileptic seizure, an inquest has found. The coroner Mary Hassell said fatigue could have been a trigger, but there was no proof of this and it was possible that the seizure was something that just happened. Erhardt, from south-west Germany, was found dead in a shower cubicle at his temporary accommodation in east London in August. The death of the dedicated student as well as reports of extreme working habits in investment bank led to a debate about a culture that effectively forces interns into working 100-hour weeks in an attempt to break into the lucrative industry. Erhardt was a week from completing a placement at Bank of America Merrill Lynch's London offices, and was due to be offered a job at the bank. An inquest at Poplar coroner's court in east London on Friday heard that he was taking medication for epilepsy, but had not told anyone at the bank about his condition. Hassell told the court: \"Unfortunately, although many, many people live with epilepsy and go on to live to old age, sometimes it still causes death very suddenly in this way and sometimes that happens even with a person as young and as fit as Moritz was. \"One of the triggers for epilepsy is exhaustion and it may be that because Moritz had been working so hard his fatigue was a trigger for the seizure that killed him. \"But that's only a possibility and I don't want his family to go away with the thought that it was something that Moritz did that causes his death. \"He was a young man living life to the full and he was clearly enjoying his time in London and, whilst it's possible that fatigue brought about the fatal seizure, it is also possible that it just happened. And it is something that does just happen.\" Peter Vanezis, a pathology professor, said there were signs that Erhardt had a seizure and gave the cause of death as epilepsy. Asked how the intern could have had a fit despite taking his medication regularly, the pathologist said: \"I am afraid it does happen. \"Epilepsy is a very unpredictable condition; unfortunately, in many cases we don't even know why people have seizures. In Moritz's case there were findings which pointed strongly to a seizure and we have a history of epilepsy. \"He was always, I'm afraid, at risk, even when taking medication.\" Asked what could have triggered the seizure, Vanezis said it could have been tiredness, but added: \"It's unpredictable, there might be a trigger, there might not be.\" Bob Elfring, co-head of corporate and investment banking at Bank of America Merrill Lynch, said: \"We are used to working with people who are ambitious and want to over-perform.\" He added that the bank's intern programme had been developed and refined to use various methods of supervision like mentors and development officers. Elfring said there was no particular urgent project Erhardt had been working on to warrant the long hours and admitted there was not a current system for monitoring working hours at the bank. Elfring said that while he did not think a clocking system should be put in place, it might be possible to introduce a way of analysing the cards used by staff to swipe into a building to see if someone was repeatedly working long hours. He said a global review had been launched in August to examine staffing and working hours at several levels, and that about 200 people had been interviewed so far. \"This is a very, very serious effort,\" he said. One City intern, who wanted to be known only as Alex, told the Guardian at the time of Erhardt's death that working for more than 100 hours was normal, but said that despite the pressures he and other interns enjoyed the experience. \"On average, I get four hours' sleep about 70% of the time \u2026 [but] there are also days with eight hours of sleep,\" Alex said. \"Work-life balance is bad.

In the same vein, last year, in an interview with Channel 4 News, Barack Obama's Kenyan half-brother was asked what he thought was the key difference between himself and Obama. He replied quickly that Obama was from the first world and he from the third world. Similarly, in his 2011 book on the modern history of Singapore, former prime minister Lee Kuan Yew makes use of the terminology by using the title From Third World to First to highlight the astonishing transformation of a small impoverished country into a modern state with one of the world's highest living standards.</p> <p>So there is some evidence to suggest that, despite the unease from some quarters, the term third world still has some mileage left when used to refer to countries that are relatively poor with low levels of development. But it is interesting to consider whether the term first world ought to be applied to some countries that have attained very high levels of income per capita. I am thinking of the Gulf states in particular.</p> <p>The World Bank's world development indicators for 2012 shows that Qatar had the third highest GDP per capita at $83,000; UAE had the 16th highest at $42,000; Saudi Arabia 29th at $32,000. In 2011 Kuwait had the 10th highest at $45,000, with Oman and Bahrain a little further back at $26,000 and $25,000 respectively.</p> <p>All these have a GDP per capita which would suggest that they are part of the first world. However, in the IMF's country categories, none of the Gulf Cooperation Council GCC states comes within other advanced economies (which exclude the G7 and euro area countries). Rather, they all fall within the highly disparate grouping of Middle East, north Africa, Afghanistan, and Pakistan.</p> <p>Yet South Korea, which has a GDP per capita slightly lower than Saudi Arabia's, is considered an advanced economy. Has the IMF got it wrong? Surely the GCC states should also be included in this exalted grouping? There are good reasons to think not: putting it somewhat euphemistically, these countries have quite some way to go.</p> <p>Judging countries solely by GDP per capita is a blunt measure of categorisation. While it might be a necessary criterion, it is certainly not a sufficient one. GCC Human Rights, a campaign group highlighting the plight of migrant workers in the Gulf provides clear reasons for this. It reported: \"In GCC countries non-white ethnic groups experience blatant discrimination ... [they] consistently deny immigrant workers the same rights enjoyed by their own citizens.\"</p> <p>GCC Human Rights website provides evidence of the most appalling abuse of human rights of non-white migrants, including systematic brutalisation and torture, which was also recently highlighted by the Guardian and Amnesty International. Their mission statement concludes with these words: \"Persuade the GCC countries to treat immigrant workers with the respect that is due them, remove all discrimination against them, and acknowledge them as first-class citizens \u2013 by doing so, these nations will become great.\"</p> <p>What constitutes countries becoming \"great\" is highly contentious but if and when the GCC countries grant international norms of human rights to the large numbers of migrants within their ranks, then their eligibility to join the ranks of the first world can be considered. Currently though, despite their stellar GDP per capita, they are better considered as part of the third world \u2013 and there should be no unease at the derogatory meaning attached in this context.</p> <p>\u2022 Dr Rumy Hasan is a senior lecturer in the SPRU (Science and Technology Policy Research) department at the University of Sussex</p>",

Surely the GCC states should also be included in this exalted grouping? There are good reasons to think not: putting it somewhat euphemistically, these countries have quite some way to go. Judging countries solely by GDP per capita is a blunt measure of categorisation. While it might be a necessary criterion, it is certainly not a sufficient one. GCC Human Rights, a campaign group highlighting the plight of migrant workers in the Gulf provides clear reasons for this. It reported: \"In GCC countries non-white ethnic groups experience blatant discrimination ... [they] consistently deny immigrant workers the same rights enjoyed by their own citizens.\" GCC Human Rights website provides evidence of the most appalling abuse of human rights of non-white migrants, including systematic brutalisation and torture, which was also recently highlighted by the Guardian and Amnesty International. Their mission statement concludes with these words: \"Persuade the GCC countries to treat immigrant workers with the respect that is due them, remove all discrimination against them, and acknowledge them as first-class citizens \u2013 by doing so, these nations will become great.\" What constitutes countries becoming \"great\" is highly contentious but if and when the GCC countries grant international norms of human rights to the large numbers of migrants within their ranks, then their eligibility to join the ranks of the first world can be considered. Currently though, despite their stellar GDP per capita, they are better considered as part of the third world \u2013 and there should be no unease at the derogatory meaning attached in this context. \u2022 Dr Rumy Hasan is a senior lecturer in the SPRU (Science and Technology Policy Research) department at the University of Sussex",

      "bodyText": "David Davis, the former Conservative challenger for the party leadership, has unsettled the Tory campaign to pin the blame for the Co-op Bank fiasco on Labour by saying the Treasury under George Osborne and the bank regulators have questions to answer over how they scrutinised the growth of the bank. Davis said clear warnings had been issued about the state of the Co-op at the time it sought to take over Lloyds branches, a deal that subsequently collapsed. Davis referred to evidence given to the Treasury select committee that claimed the Co-op's problems were set out in January 2012 in a letter to the Lloyds board from Lord Levene, a City veteran who headed a rival bid for the branches. \"There are really serious questions to answer about what they were all doing,\" Davis said. \"These problems were apparent to a rival and would have been \u2013 with a bit of work \u2013 to anyone else.\" At the time Levene wrote the letter he was chairman of NBNK, a new banking vehicle that was seeking to take over the Lloyds branches. He said: \"Both internally and externally the deal is felt to be at high risk of falling because of a number of factors.\" He highlighted four risks to the Co-op's ability to complete the purchase: its ability to finance the deal; existing pressure on management from other projects; its outdated IT systems; and risks to customer service. Chris Leslie, the shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, welcomed the intervention and said Davis was right to argue that there were serious questions for Osborne, the Treasury and regulators over how the Co-op Bank had got into trouble over the last three years. \"What due diligence was done by the chancellor and the Treasury into the state of the Co-op Bank and its leadership when ministers were encouraging the bank's failed bid for 632 Lloyds branches? \"George Osborne and ministers in David Cameron's government must finally come clean and answer questions about what went wrong at the Co-op Bank on their watch and whether they knew of the balance sheet risks.\" Ed Balls, who received a \u00a350,000 donation for Labour from the Co-operative Group, is also in the line of fire for claiming credit for the way he eased the chances of the Co-op taking over the Britannia Building Society in 2009. The takeover turned out to be an error as the building society had more bad debts than it realised. Balls, in his election literature for the Labour leadership in 2010, pointed to the way in which he had supported a Tory-sponsored private member's bill in 2007 that allowed building societies and co-operatives to merge without demutualising. The merger of the Britannia and the Co-op occurred after Balls left the Treasury as economic secretary and became education secretary. The long-term future of the Co-operative Group, which is owned by its 7 million members, and of the Co-op Bank is putting another cloud over Labour finances. The Co-op Group has said it will reform its democratic organisation and restructure the bank, the majority of which has been sold to two US-based hedge funds to stave off collapse. Len Wardle, chairman of the Co-op group, resigned this week, saying he took responsibility for appointing the Rev Paul Flowers as chairman of the bank. Regulators are expected to announce imminently the scope of investigations into the bank's failure, and the Treasury is preparing to order its own inquiry. These are expected to last for years. The timing is sensitive because the Co-op must secure bondholder approval for the restructuring of its banking business in the next two weeks. Any less generous approach to Labour by the Co-op Bank, its chief lender, would be a blow as the party prepares to raise funds for the general election, and also undertake reforms that might see a drop in the cash provided to Labour by union central coffers.",

    "webTitle": "Energy firms 'facing cash drought after Ed Miliband's speech', says analyst", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "A leading City analyst claimed on Thursday that Ed Miliband had \"killed stone dead\" any chance of one of the big six energy firms obtaining finance for a very large new wind farm or gas fired power station before the next election. The warning from Peter Atherton at Liberum Capital came as a new row blew up around accusations of energy profiteering, this time by National Grid, which reported first half operating earnings of more than \u00a31.5bn. Atherton said the Labour leader's promise of an energy bill freeze and threat to break up large energy utilities had badly damaged confidence and raised the cost of capital for some firms by as much 20%. \"Big ticket items such as offshore windfarms have been killed stone dead. If any board directors [of the big six] were stupid enough to agree to try to raise money in the City now they would be told to 'get stuffed'. They [banks or others] would be very reluctant to finance even the independent power providers who are not directly in the firing line,\" he said. Atherton said that Miliband's speech at the Labour party conference had aggravated an already difficult situation caused by endless uncertainty about the timing and detail of the coalition's own energy market reform legislation. But consumer anger over bills is currently focused on the companies themselves, with National Grid described by Energyhelpline as \"one of the fattest of the fat cats in today's broken energy market\". The criticism from the switching firm's founder Mark Todd came after detailed figures showed the Grid made operating profits from its UK electricity transmission business alone of \u00a3614m on revenues of \u00a31.7bn. The Grid made \u00a3456m profits on revenues of \u00a3945m on its UK gas distribution business, but only \u00a3330m on revenues of \u00a33.4bn in its US operations. All these are regulated businesses, but both the company and independent experts said it was difficult to compare US with UK figures. They also cautioned against comparing them directly with the much lower \u2013 but still criticised \u2013 profit margins of Britain's big six supply companies that are the Grid's customers. The Grid, whose electricity and gas transmission charges have partly been blamed by power suppliers for their bill increases, rewarded shareholders with a 14.49p a share dividend, costing \u00a3520m. Steve Holliday, the chief executive, defended the payout and the scale of profits saying they were needed to retain shareholder support for new investment in energy networks, which will cost \u00a33.5bn this year alone. \"We continue to invest efficiently in essential regulated assets on both sides of the Atlantic, providing our customers with reliable networks while generating value and driving growth,\" he said. He described Todd's criticism as \"unhelpful\" and said his company was tightly regulated, with any extra profits halved and handed back to customers. The Grid's transmission and distribution costs amounted to only \u00a311 out of every \u00a3100 recent increase in energy bills, he said. Over the next eight years, under the latest agreement with Ofgem, costs would go up by less than \u00a31 per year. But Todd said the transmission company's charges now made up about \u00a3175 of every energy bill, a total of around \u00a34.5bn every year across 26m UK households. \"It is time for the government and Ofgem to step up and take control with tougher regulation on the National Grid and a new settlement that forces costs down, not up by 7.5% a year. Clearly Ofgem have been bamboozled by National Grid and have been too soft on them.\" But Ofgem defended itself pointing out that the price controls set for the Grid forced it to cut \u00a35.7bn investments from the original business plan that the regulator ruled were of no benefit to consumers. In a statement it added: \"Ofgem's price controls also include a mechanism that ensures where any outperformance is due to the company delivering it at less cost than expected, these profits are shared automatically with consumers. Ofgem has consistently set the lowest allowed rate of returns for regulated utilities.\" .",

      "body": "<p>A leading City analyst claimed on Thursday that Ed Miliband had \"killed stone dead\" any chance of one of the big six energy firms obtaining finance for a very large new wind farm or gas fired power station before the next election.</p> <p>The warning from Peter Atherton at Liberum Capital came as a new row blew up around accusations of energy profiteering, this time by National Grid, which reported first half operating earnings of more than \u00a31.5bn.</p> <p>Atherton said the Labour leader's promise of an energy bill freeze and threat to break up large energy utilities had badly damaged confidence and raised the cost of capital for some firms by as much 20%.</p> <p>\"Big ticket items such as offshore windfarms have been killed stone dead. If any board directors [of the big six] were stupid enough to agree to try to raise money in the City now they would be told to 'get stuffed'. They [banks or others] would be very reluctant to finance even the independent power providers who are not directly in the firing line,\" he said.</p> <p>Atherton said that Miliband's speech at the Labour party conference had aggravated an already difficult situation caused by endless uncertainty about the timing and detail of the coalition's own energy market reform legislation.</p> <p>But consumer anger over bills is currently focused on the companies themselves, with National Grid described by Energyhelpline as \"one of the fattest of the fat cats in today's broken energy market\".</p> <p>The criticism from the switching firm's founder Mark Todd came after detailed figures showed the Grid made operating profits from its UK electricity transmission business alone of \u00a3614m on revenues of \u00a31.7bn. The Grid made \u00a3456m profits on revenues of \u00a3945m on its UK gas distribution business, but only \u00a3330m on revenues of \u00a33.4bn in its US operations.</p> <p>All these are regulated businesses, but both the company and independent experts said it was difficult to compare US with UK figures.
