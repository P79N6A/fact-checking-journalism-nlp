      "bodyText": "Britain\u2019s increasing reliance on energy imports as the North Sea\u2019s oil and gas wealth declines has been highlighted by the diplomatic crisis engulfing Qatar. Nearly a third of the UK\u2019s gas imports are from the tiny Gulf state, the world\u2019s largest producer of liquefied natural gas (LNG), which it ships to Europe and Asia, including to its three biggest customers: JapanIndia and South Korea. Qatar\u2019s transport links were severed by Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Egypt and several other countries on Monday over Doha\u2019s alleged funding of extremist groups. Ports, including refuelling hub Fujairah in the UAE, have been closed to Qatari-flagged ships raising concerns over cost hikes and delays to shipments. A few decades ago, this would not have mattered to the UK. Britain was self-sufficient in gas from the North Sea until 2004 but declining domestic production means that 60% of gas is now imported. National Grid, which operates Britain\u2019s energy networks, believes the reliance on imports could reach 93% by 2040. This means the Qatar dispute inevitably raises concerns. However, Dr Bassam Fattouh, the director of the Oxford Institute for Energy Studies, said the situation would have little effect on gas exports. \u201cI don\u2019t see any impact on energy supplies to the UK and to the rest of the world,\u201d he said. \u201cWhy would Qatar stop exporting LNG? The shipping lanes are open. \u201cThe markets should not be spooked,\u201d he added, although he warned the crisis could introduce some erratic volatility to oil and gas markets. Analysts at Julius Baer, the Swiss bank, echoed that view. \u201cDisruptions, especially of the seaborne shipments, are highly unlikely,\u201d they said. Ira Joseph, head of gas analytics at consultancy Pira Energy, said: \u201cThe UK market is the destination of last resort for Qatari LNG, so it would be the last and not the first place to have an impact.\u201d Norway provides nearly two-thirds of UK gas imports via pipelines, while Qatar provided 29% of imports in 2015. Italy is the second biggest European importer of Qatari gas, according to analysts at oil and gas group Wood Mackenzie. Poland opened its first LNG terminal last year, to import from Qatar and the US in a bid to reduce its reliance on Russian gas. In Britain, the heavily compressed gas is taken by vast Qatari tankers to one of three LNG terminals, where it is stored, ready to be returned to its gaseous state to heat homes and fuel power stations. One terminal is run by British Gas owner Centrica in the Isle of Grain in the Thames estuary. Two are in south Wales \u2013 one owned by Shell and the other by Qatar, which also owns other significant UK assets such as the Shard and Harrods. Proponents of fracking to extract shale gas said the problems facing Doha showed why the UK must develop its own shale gas industry, like the US. \u201cWhat\u2019s happening [in Qatar] is quite unprecedented,\u201d said Ken Cronin, chief executive of the United Kingdom Onshore Operators Group (Ukoog). While escalation in the Gulf and disruption of energy supplies seemed unlikely now, he said, it would have a broader impact on the world if the situation worsened. \u201cIt\u2019s important for us to insulate,\u201d he said . \u201cMaybe not so much for now, because we have the North Sea and Norway, but by 2030-35 we are going to be importing 70%-80% of our gas, and the majority of that is going to come from the LNG market if we haven\u2019t started the shale gas industry.\u201d Exploratory shale gas drilling has been bogged down in the planning process in the face of local opposition for the past few years, but the Conservative manifesto pledged to remove the need for planning permission for small sites. Fracking involves pumping water, chemicals and sand underground at high pressure to fracture shale rock and release trapped gas to the surface - a technique opposed by environmentalists and local communities. The first major exploratory drilling is expected to begin in the next two months at a site in Lancashire run by Cuadrilla, a leading British fracking company. Cronin admitted that even if a commercial shale gas industry was up and running by the end of the decade, as he hoped, it was too early to say if it could compete on price with LNG imports. \u201cThat\u2019s difficult to answer now,\u201d he said. Other customers of Qatar\u2019s gas include the UAE and Egypt, two of the countries that cut diplomatic ties with Doha. Despite the row, Qatar is still supplying the UAE via a pipeline that provides crucial gas for the power stations that the capital Abu Dhabi relies on. The Dolphin pipeline supplies 35% of the UAE\u2019s gas demand. \u201cSo far there is no indication that either the Qataris or the Emiratis are going to disrupt the gas flows from the pipeline,\u201d said Fattouh. However, he said that if there was disruption of the pipeline, \u201cit would be quite problematic\u201d, especially during summer, when air conditioning and other factors meant electricity demand was high. There is no sign either that Egypt is turning away Qatari LNG shipments. Cairo is bound by international agreements to keep the Suez canal open to Qatari tankers, though it could reduce the discount such LNG ships enjoy. Even if the Suez passage was blocked or rendered uneconomical, experts said, it would not add a huge amount of time if vessels had to go around the Horn of Africa. While Qatar\u2019s riches are built on gas, which it only began exporting in 1996, the country is also a member of Opec, the cartel of major oil-producers. Doha is seen as unlikely to want to scupper a recent deal by Opec to extend production cuts to buoy up the oil price. Even if it did, or was ejected from the group as part of the diplomatic row, the ripples are likely to be minimal, as Qatar only accounts for 2% of Opec\u2019s oil output. \u201cIn terms of Opec, Qatar is a very small player,\u201d said Fattouh. \u201cOpec has had worse conflicts in past.\u201d The UK, nonetheless, will hope for a swift conclusion to the Qatar spat.",

      "bodyText": "The UK economy was the worst performer in the European Union in the opening months of 2017 as the Brexit vote took its toll, according to official statistics that underscore the challenge facing the next British government. With economic growth of just 0.2% in the first three months of this year, the UK was well behind its European neighbours. Official EU figures released as Britons went to the polls on Thursday showed the growth for the whole of the EU was 0.6% in the first quarter. The eurozone single currency bloc also grew 0.6% in the opening quarter, buoyed by strong domestic demand. The Eurostat figures showed every nation in the 28-member bloc reported first-quarter GDP figures growing faster than the UK. The strongest expansion was in Romania at 1.7%, followed by Latvia at 1.6% and Slovenia at 1.5%. The closest countries to the UK\u2019s weak pace of growth were France and Greece, with GDP growing 0.4% in both. However, in year-on-year terms the UK was closer to the EU performance and ahead of the 19-nation eurozone. After a strong second half to 2016, when the economy defied predictions of a post-referendum slump, UK GDP was still 2% bigger in the first quarter of 2017 than a year earlier. The EU\u2019s economy was 2.1% bigger on the year while the eurozone was up 1.9%. Recent business surveys have suggested the UK economy has picked up some momentum in the second quarter after its slow start to 2017. But with higher inflation weighing on consumer spending, most forecasters expect growth to be lacklustre over 2017 as a whole and even weaker in 2018. The main pressure is expected to come from higher inflation, stemming largely from the pound\u2019s sharp fall since the Brexit vote last year. That has made the many imported goods to the UK more expensive and been passed on to consumers. Wages meanwhile have failed to keep pace with those price rises and so workers are worse off in real terms and have been cutting back. Prospects for the 19-nation eurozone, by contrast, have brightened. Political uncertainty has diminished now France\u2019s presidential election is out the way, unemployment has fallen, business surveys point to solid demand and a continuing recovery in the global economy could boost exports, economists say. The confirmation that the UK was the worst performer in the EU growth league in the first quarter follows news last week that it was also trailing behind the world\u2019s advanced economies, with Canada registering stellar growth in the first three months of the year. The outlook for the UK was tough but stronger global prospects should provide some cheer, economists said. \u201cBrexit has been partly to blame for slower UK growth, as higher prices due to lower sterling and uncertainty hit retail spending and the willingness of firms to invest,\u201d said George Buckley, economist at the financial firm Nomura. \u201cBut it\u2019s not all bad news \u2013 this is as much a story about global strength as it is about downside risks to the UK, which should eventually support exports\u201d The European Central Bank was the latest body to raise its growth forecasts for the eurozone on Thursday after telling financial markets it had no plans to cut interest rates. ECB president Mario Draghi said growth was now expected to come in at 1.9% in 2017, up from the 1.8% forecast made in March. The outlook for 2018 was nudged up to 1.8% growth, from 1.7%. \u201cWe consider that the risks to the growth outlook are now broadly balanced,\u201d said Draghi, dropping a previous assertion that risks were skewed to the downside. Draghi said the risk of deflation \u2013 or persistently falling prices \u2013 in the eurozone had dissipated. But at the same time, inflation was not showing much sign of picking up and the ECB toned down its inflation forecasts for this year, 2018 and 2019. That suggested policymakers would be in no hurry to withdraw the stimulus they have been providing to the eurozone after the global financial crash of 2008-9 and the eurozone debt crisis of 2012. That broad package of measures, includes printing electronic money to buy bonds and record low interest rates. Some rates are below zero, meaning people effectively pay to deposit money.",

      "bodyText": "Markets were edgy as polling got underway for the election on Thursday, with traders believing a Conservative victory was the most likely outcome but growing increasingly cautious about the size of the majority. The pound fell 0.11% to $1.2945 against the dollar as the London stock market closed, after earlier climbing to a two-week high of $1.2977. Against the euro it added 0.23% to \u20ac1.1535. However, an index that measures sterling volatility surged to its highest level in a year in expectation of strong swings in the currency as results begin to come in. The FTSE 100 fell 0.38% to 7449.98, as investors also digested the decision by the European Central Bank to rule out further interest rate cuts, and watched the US Senate testimony from ex-FBI director James Comey for any implications for the Trump administration. David Madden, market analyst at CMC Markets UK, said the FTSE 100 was down because dealers were concerned about the outcome of the UK general election. \u201cIf you take an average of the polls conducted, it points to a Conservative win but some investors have less confidence in the polls, in the wake of Brexit and President Trump,\u201d he said. However, the pound and stock market are both expected to rise sharply if the Conservatives win a large majority. David Cheetham, chief market analyst at XTB, said: \u201cSterling has moved off its highest levels of the year in recent weeks as polls have tightened, but the market is seemingly pricing in a victory for the Conservatives. This is not to say that there isn\u2019t the potential for further sterling appreciation on a Tory victory, with a clear extension of their majority likely to see more gains ahead. \u201cHowever the outcome is far less certain than PM May would have hoped when she announced the snap election back in mid-April and a loss of her majority would come as a crushing blow to not only her party, but also to the pound.\u201d City analysts believe the pound would rise to at least $1.31 if Theresa May ends up with a bigger working majority than the current 17 seats. But there is likely to be turbulence in the markets if the Tories fail to improve on this figure. Kathleen Brooks, research director at financial firm City Index, said that a slim majority would \u201carouse fears of a hard Brexit\u201d. \u201cThis could spook sterling traders,\u201d she said and suggested the pound could fall towards $1.25 \u2013 the level it was trading at before the election was called. A hung parliament just ahead of the start of Brexit negotiations could see sterling slump by around six cents to $1.23. Ipek Ozkardeskaya, senior market analyst at London Capital Group, said a Labour victory would also send the pound lower: \u201cAn unexpected and sudden shift to the Labour party would change the Brexit dynamics completely and push the political environment in the UK to a total unknown. The pound could retreat below the $1.25 mark. Banks and financials could suffer the most in case of a Labour majority.\u201d But currency experts at Dutch bank ING were less negative on Jeremy Corbyn winning: \u201cIf a credible Labour-led coalition can be formed quickly, then we are likely to see markets price in greater odds of a softer Brexit deal and this could arguably help the pound recover from any initial sell-off. \u201cFrom the currency\u2019s perspective, this channel is likely to outweigh any questions over Labour\u2019s economic policies.\u201d Marc Ostwald of ADM Investor Services said even if May ends up back in No 10, she has a tough job ahead of her: \u201cEven if a substantially larger majority is achieved, there is little doubt that it will make not an iota of difference to the EU\u2019s stance on Brexit negotiations, though it will heighten the risk that both sides continue to talk at, rather than to each other, and end in a complete breakdown. \u201cThere is also little doubt that the UK economy is now facing some significant headwinds, above all consumers that are facing higher inflation, weak wage growth and the pressures associated with a far too rapid pace of credit growth, the more so given an increasingly soggy housing market, above all in the populous south-east.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Finally, away from the Triple Threats, there are developments concerning Greece. The IMF has confirmed that the fund\u2019s managing director will attend next week\u2019s critical meeting of eurozone finance ministers as efforts intensify to resolve the rift over how to lighten the country\u2019s debt load. Helena Smith reports from Athens: Its official: Christine Lagarde will attend the June 15 eurogroup meeting in Luxembourg according to IMF spokesman Gerry Rice. Her presence now leaves the door open to the Fund approving a program \u201cin principle\u201d if the impasse over debt relief isn\u2019t resolved at the meeting \u2013 an effective get-out clause that would allow the EU more time to come to an agreement while emergency loans were disbursed to Greece in time for \u20ac7.5bn worth of debt repayments in July. The IMF has made clear it will not contribute to disbursements until a debt relief formula is devised permitting Largarde to make the case for further bailout participation before the body\u2019s board. \u201cWe would still be insisting on reforms and debt relief before the IMF would disburse any of its funds,\u201d Rice told reporters this afternoon. \u201cSo this is not a backing down or a walking away in any respect.\u201d The EU and IMF have been at loggerheads over how to make Greece\u2019s gargantuan debt load sustainable \u2013 a prerequisite for the ECB to accept the country into its stimulus programme. Earlier Thursday, the EU economic affairs commissioner Pierre Moscovici cautioned against \u201cplaying with fire\u201d saying it was vital a debt relief agreement was secured on June 15. Lagarde had stayed away from the last and inconclusive meeting of euro area finance ministers on May 22 amid concerns the country\u2019s debt crisis was poised to flare up again. The Greek prime minister Alexis Tsipras legislated further pension cuts and tax rises recently telling sceptical MPs a debt deal would be reached that would put Greece back on the road to economic recovery. Late on Wednesday he said EU investment programs should now be used to heal the rift between the EU and IMF by igniting the sort of growth that would bring concordance on debt relief. Citing data released by the labour ministry, the leftist leader told the inaugural European Concordia summit in Athens that indices were improving with 89,500 \u201creal jobs\u201d being created in May in addition to the 92,000 work places created in April. On Thursday, the country\u2019s statistics agency, Elstat, said unemployment had dropped from a record high of 27.9% in September 2013 to 22.5% in March. On that note, it\u2019s time to close for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and for the latest on the UK election we\u2019ll be following events through the night. Otherwise we\u2019ll be back here as usual tomorrow to cover the aftermath of the vote. The testimony of ex-FBI director James Comey certainly does not appear to be troubling the US markets. The Dow Jones Industrial Average has just hit a new peak of 21,265. Its last record was just under a week ago on 2 June. Triple Threat Thursday has so far pass off without too much market drama. Ahead of the close of polls in the UK election, the FTSE 100 and the pound have both slipped back, with investors nervous about the possible outcome. The general feeling is that a Conservative majority is on the cards, but traders are not ruling out a surprise, given the Brexit and Trump shocks. In Europe, the euro has weakened as the European Central Bank ruled out lowering interest rates, a change in its policy. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished 28.64 points or 0.38% lower at 7449.98 Germany\u2019s Dax closed 0.32% higher at 12,713.58 France\u2019s Cac slipped 0.02% to 5264.24 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB rose 1.46% to 21,042.41 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended 0.75% higher at 10,953.1 In Greece, the Athens market added 0.61% to 779.05 On Wall Street, as James Comey\u2019s testimony continues, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is up 29 points or 0.14%. On the latest market reaction to the UK election, David Madden, market analyst at CMC Markets UK, said: The FTSE 100 is sliding today as dealers are concerned about the UK general election. If you take an average of the polls conducted, it points to a Conservative win but some investors have less confidence in the polls, in the wake of Brexit and President Trump. The UK stock market would prefer a Tory victory as the party is more in favour of free market economics than Labour. The ground lost by the Conservatives in the past couple of weeks has rattled some traders. So far markets seem to be taking the day\u2019s big events in their stride. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said: There\u2019s been a bit more movement this afternoon, but nothing to quite deliver on the promise of \u2018triple threat Thursday\u2019. So far James Comey\u2019s appearance in front of the Senate intelligence committee has done little to disrupt the US markets \u2013 if anything the dollar is looking pretty perky, rising against both the pound and the euro. Of course it\u2019s early days yet, with a couple of hours to go until the former FBI chief\u2019s public testimony is finished. Who knows what it will uncover? Elsewhere the ECB largely went through the motions this afternoon. Though the ECB\u2019s inflation forecasts cuts had already been leaked, the central bank did still pull a mild surprise out of the bag by dropping the reference to lowering interest rates, stating that they would \u2018remain at their present levels for an extended period of time\u2019. Yet Draghi made sure that this wasn\u2019t taken as too hawkish, something that only ended up disappointing the euro, which fell half a percent against the dollar and 0.1% against the pound. And what of the UK? Well, the FTSE found itself down by around 0.2%, while the pound gradually shed its early growth, both saving any major movements until they get a glimpse at the first trickle of results this evening. A reminder that ex-FBI head James Comey is testifying at the moment. So far there has been little market reaction, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average down just a couple of points. Here\u2019s a flavour of the meeting, with Comey explaining why he started making contemporaneous notes about his discussions with President Trump: Why did Comey decide to document that [first] discussion. What was it about that meeting? Comey replies: \u201cA combination of things. The circumstances, the subject matter and the person I was interacting with.\u201d Comey says he was alone with the president-elect discussing weighty matters. Then: I was honestly concerned that he might lie about the nature of our meeting, and so I thought it was important to document it. Our live blog is here: The European Central Bank has got the eurozone economy moving again, but will it last, asks our economics editor Larry Elliott: Growth forecasts revised up. Inflation forecasts revised down. Jobs being created. Take a bow Mario Draghi. Urged on by its proactive boss, the European Central Bank has achieved what looked impossible until recently: it has got the eurozone economy moving again. Draghi should milk the applause while he can because the eurozone\u2019s sweet spot won\u2019t last for ever. It didn\u2019t in the US and it didn\u2019t in the UK, two countries that pursued exactly the same macro-economic strategy as the ECB, only earlier. His full analysis is here: More reaction to Draghi and the ECB: Fawad Razaqzada, technical analyst at Forex.com, said: There was so much fuss made about this key ECB meeting and it ended up being a bit of a damp squib. The central bank and its president Mario Draghi delivered contradictory statements about inflation and probably left many market participants feeling somewhat disappointed that there wasn\u2019t anything concrete announced. To be fair, the leaked inflation and growth forecasts earlier this week had already taken the edge out of this meeting and many people had already prepared to hear a more dovish than a hawkish ECB. Hence, the euro didn\u2019t exactly fall off a cliff. Back with the European Central Bank, and Carsten Brzeski at ING Bank has commented again following Mario Draghi\u2019s press conference: It was a bit like in the good old days when ECB watchers looked out for code words like \u201cvigilance\u201d. This time around, all eyes were on the ECB\u2019s forward guidance on interest rates and the risk assessment for the economic outlook. On both, the ECB delivered some changes. As regards the forward guidance on interest rates, it was not about what the ECB said but what it actually didn\u2019t say. The ECB omitted the reference that interest rates could even be lower than their present levels and therefore dropped the easing bias for interest rates. Let\u2019s not forget, however, that at the same time, the ECB kept the easing bias on QE, sticking to the formulation that the ECB would be willing to step up its monthly asset purchases if need be. Also, Draghi remarked that the ECB will remain in the market for a long while and the QE tapering was not discussed at today\u2019s meeting. As regards the ECB\u2019s macro-economic assessment, the ECB upgraded the risk to the growth outlook from negative to now \u201cbroadly balanced\u201d. Actually the first time since 2011 that the ECB calls the outlook for growth balanced. The improved economic outlook, however, has not yet led to any significant inflationary pressure in the Eurozone. This picture was reflected in the ECB staff\u2019s economic projections which were marginally upgraded to 1.9% (during the Q&amp;A session, Draghi said that due to the upward revision of 1Q GDP, growth would actually now come in at 2%), 1.8% and 1.7% in 2017, 2018 and 2019 respectively. At the same time, the inflation projections were revised downwards to 1.5%, 1.3% and 1.6% for 2017, 2018 and 2019. Even though the downward revision was mainly the result of lower oil prices and a slightly stronger exchange rate, subdued inflation rates remain the biggest concern for the ECB. Reasons for low inflation rates are in our view not only the slack in the Eurozone economy, still high unemployment and a high number of (involuntary) part-time and low-wage employment but also globalisation and digitalisation. In our view, today\u2019s ECB meeting was a very first baby step towards eventual tapering. It is obvious that the ECB is trying to be as cautious as possible to very gradually get out of the unconventional monetary policy measures. Therefore, this process of preparing markets extremely carefully with words and changes in the communication will continue and can take a long while before the ECB delivers new action. In this context, the low inflation forecasts in our view argue in favour of only a mild tapering and probably a tapering without an end date on it. There is clearly room for another \u201clonger but lower\u201d announcement for 2018 later this year. All in all, the ECB today delivered two important linguistic changes to its official communication which were more than only words. These changes marked the official start of a taper tiptoeing. A tiptoeing which will still take a long while before it could be called policy normalisation. With the third element of Triple Threat Thursday - the testimony of ex-FBI head James Comey - due shortly, US markets have got off to an uncertain start. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down just 5 points, while the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq Composite both edged higher. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said: Following the release of James Comey\u2019s statement on Wednesday \u2013 which suggested Trump pressured him for a pledge of loyalty and implied his job was in peril if he didn\u2019t drop the Michael Flynn investigation \u2013 all eyes will be on the former FBI chief\u2019s testimony in front of the Senate intelligence committee. Presently neither the dollar nor Dow Jones seems too fussed by the recent revelations, though that could all change when Comey takes the stand. For those wanting to follow Comey\u2019s testimony, our US live blog is here: Q: The economy has started to improve nicely; is that because of QE or despite QE? It\u2019s because of QE - we\u2019re here because of that, smiles Draghi (perhaps inwardly fuming at this implied criticism of his precious stimulus package). And then he reels off the evidence that QE has worked: Eurozone growth in the first quarter of 2017 has been revised up today from 0.5% to 0.6%. The PMI indices, which track private sector output, are at their highest level since April 2011. The eurozone economic sentiment is close to its highest level, set in 2007. And unemployment is the lowest since 2009....and five million jobs have been created in the last three and a half years, more than in America. And that\u2019s the end of the ECB press conference. Another nudge to Europe\u2019s elected leaders to crack on with the job: Draghi is trying to cool speculation that the ECB is inching towards the exit of its stimulus programme.... Q: Could the ECB increase its QE programme if the economy weakens? Draghi says that there is adequate \u201cflexibility\u201d in the asset purchase scheme. An Estonian journalist asks if her country is unfairly missing out from the ECB\u2019s asset purchase scheme, because it doesn\u2019t have any government debt for the ECB to mop up. Draghi argues that Estonia benefits from QE\u2019s positive impact on the euro area, as it is an open economy. Q: Why did the ECB decide that Santander was the best candidate to take over Banco Popular? Vice-president V\u00edtor Const\u00e2ncio says that the ECB concluded that Popular was \u201cfailing or likely to fail\u201d, as a bank run was taking hold and liquidity was running low. But the final decision on its future was taken by the Single Resolution Board (an independent agency) not the ECB Q: Did the ECB discuss when to start normalising monetary policy? No, says Draghi.... but then he remembers that two council members made some observations about this issue. I suspect that one of them was Germany\u2019s top central banker, Jens Weidmann. Q: Could a prolonged lower inflation rate force the ECB to change its forward guidance and raise its negative deposit rate before ending its QE programme? [currently it promises to complete the asset purchase scheme before tackling interest rates] \u201cNo, no\u201d says Draghi, emphatically. Nothing substantial has happened to inflation, other than changes to the oil price, he insists. Q: Should we expect the ECB to outline its tapering strategy in September, following today\u2019s decision to drop your pledge to cut interest rates? It was not discussed, president Mario Draghi snaps back. Q: Last month, ECB governing council member Ewald Nowotny questioned whether the ECB\u2019s inflation target was achievable. Should the markets share his concerns? Draghi says it\u2019s important to look at the reasons behind Europe\u2019s low inflation. One problem is that wage growth is modest, because negotiations are \u201cbackward looking\u201d -- ie, bosses only offer small pay rises because inflation has been so low recently. Draghi also points out that many of the jobs created recently are of relatively poor quality -- many are temporary, or part-time. So \u201cWe need to be patient....and persistent\u201d, Draghi insists. The euro has shed half a cent against the US dollar after Mario Draghi announced the ECB has slashed its inflation forecasts. Q: Did the ECB act quickly enough to tackle Banco Popular (the Spanish bank which was rescued by Santander this week). Draghi says he can\u2019t comment on individual institutions, but he hails the \u201ctimely action\u201d of the regulators who handled the sale. Onto questions Q: Were today\u2019s decisions unanimous? We didn\u2019t have a vote, but I didn\u2019t hear any dissenting voices, Draghi replies (presumably he hadn\u2019t stuck his fingers in his ears....) Draghi ends his statement with his traditional call on European governments to do more to tackle structural problems in their economics, and underpin the recovery. The leaks were true! The ECB has cut its forecasts for inflation over the next few years. Here are the new forecasts for CPI inflation: 2017: 1.5%, down from 1.7% previously 2018: 1.3%, down from 1.6% 2019: 1.6%, down from 1.7% Draghi says this is mainly due to lower oil prices. More encouraging news. The ECB has raised its growth forecasts for the next few years. It now expects GDP to rise by 1.9% this year, up from 1.8% expected back in March. It has also raised its growth forecasts for 2018 and 2019 by 0.1 percentage points, to 1.8% and 1.7% respectively. But while the eurozone economy is recovering, there are still \u201cdownside risks\u201d, predominately due to \u201cglobal factors\u201d, Draghi says. Boom! Mario Draghi says that the eurozone recovery is enjoying \u201cstronger momentum\u201d, and now growing at a \u201csomewhat faster pace than previously expected. Risks to the growth outlook are now \u201cbroadly balanced\u201d, he declares -- dropping the ECB\u2019s previous warning that risks were to the downside. Over in Tallinn, Mario Draghi has arrived to explain the decisions taken at today\u2019s ECB governing council meetings. He confirms that the ECB left interest rates on hold, adding: The Governing Council expects the key ECB interest rates to remain at their present levels for an extended period of time, and well past the horizon of the net asset purchases. That\u2019s confirmation that the pledge to cut rates to \u201clower levels\u201d if needed has been dropped. Draghi also confirms that the ECB agreed to maintain its asset purchase programme at \u20ac60bn per month, adding: If the outlook becomes less favourable, or if financial conditions become inconsistent with further progress towards a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation, the Governing Council stands ready to increase the programme in terms of size and/or duration. The ECB president then turns to the economic situation. Our stimulus programme has created the \u201cvery favourable financing conditions\u201d that are needed to get inflation back to the ECB\u2019s target of close to but below 2%. Away from the ECB for a moment, and more positive signs from the US economy. Weekly jobless claims fell to 245,000 compared to 255,000 the previous week. That however was slightly worse than the 240,000 figure that had been expected. And the previous week\u2019s figure was revised up from the original estimate of 248,000. This really is a historic day..... You might have expected the euro to rally, after the ECB dropped its pledge to cut interest rates to fresh lows if needed. But actually the single currency has fallen a little, down 0.3% today at $1.1225, after a sudden spike when the ECB announcement hit the wires. That shows that investors expected today\u2019s change in language, and are also anticipating a dovish performance from ECB chief Mario Draghi in a few minutes. Fred Ducrozet of Pictet Bank says the ECB has taken a symbolic step towards tightening monetary policy in the eurozone, for the first time in many years. Carsten Brzeski of ING calls it a \u2018baby step\u2019 towards tapering (or trimming the size of the ECB\u2019s QE programme down from \u20ac60bn per month). It was not about what the ECB said but what it didn\u2019t say. In fact, the ECB omitted the reference that interest rates could be lower than their present levels. This easing bias is now gone. Starting at 2.30pm CET, Draghi will present the new ECB staff macro-economic projections, the ECB\u2019s assessment on growth and inflation and possibly some hints at the future path of monetary policy. In our view, some tweaks to the macro-economic risk assessment as a clear statement that the current recovery does still not show any inflationary signs are the most likely outcomes of the press conference. Kathleen Brooks of City Index says the ECB appears to have ruled out the prospect of further rate cuts. We still need to hear from Mario Draghi, but the initial assessment of the early statement is that the ECB may have made some tiny, tentative steps towards policy normalisation by dropping a reference that it could cut interest rates further. We still need to see the ECB staff forecasts for growth and inflation, and there is a big expectation that the ECB will sharply cut its inflation forecast to the 1.5% level, way below the ECB\u2019s 2% target rate. Reto Foellmi, Professor of International Economics at University of St.Gallen, says interest rates will still remain at record lows for some time, despite the \u2018spillover\u2019 effects on the global economy. While the short-term costs of prolonging the ongoing monetary regime for a quarter or so seem small, it is not without incident. The longer we stay in this regime the more severe consequences it has on related currencies, such as the Swiss Franc. The actions of the ECB force them to set very low interest rates and to engage in huge bond buying programmes on their own. This spillover effect to other currencces makes it more difficult it is to change the course of action afterwards.\u201d The ECB has also voted to keep creating \u20ac60bn of new money each month, to buy government and corporate bonds in an attempt to get inflation up. The bank has also pledged to boost this QE programme if needed, saying: If the outlook becomes less favourable, or if financial conditions become inconsistent with further progress towards a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation, the Governing Council stands ready to increase the programme in terms of size and/or duration. Newsflash: The European Central Bank has dropped its pledge to cut interest rates to fresh record lows if needed. Following today\u2019s governing council meeting, the ECB has (as expected) voted to leave borrowing costs at their current levels. But importantly, it has adjusted the language in today\u2019s statement. It now says that it expects interest rates to remain \u201cat their present levels for an extended period of time\u201d. Previously, the ECB promised that rates would remain \u201cat their present levels or lower\u201d. So this is the first step towards tightening monetary policy in the euro area - although we\u2019re still a long way from an actual interest rate hike. Today\u2019s decision means that the headline interest rate in the eurozone remains at 0.0%, and banks must pay a negative interest rate of -0.4% when they leave money in the ECB\u2019s vaults rather than lending it to businesses and households. Reaction to follow.... It\u2019s nearly time for the first of today\u2019s \u2018triple threats\u2019 -- the results of today\u2019s European Central Bank meeting, followed by Mario Draghi\u2019s press conference. Investors across the eurozone, and beyond, will be looking closely for signs that the ECB could adjust its monetary policy stance, especially after today\u2019s growth upgrades. Dennis de Jong, managing director at UFX.com, explains: While investors have their eyes and ears glued to the UK\u2019s general election, today\u2019s EU GDP release and this afternoon\u2019s interest rate decision could have big ramifications for financial markets. \u201cMost were expecting the upward revision of 0.6% to be confirmed and the latest estimate of EU GDP, although positive, is unlikely to alter Mario Draghi\u2019s thinking ahead of his lunchtime press conference. \u201cWhen Draghi speaks later today, investors will be listening out for any dovish tones on interest rates. The ECB has previously stated that rates will remain \u2018at present or lower\u2019, and any removal of the potential to loosen monetary policy further could perk up markets significantly.\u201d Joshua Mahony, market analyst at IG, says the City is facing the \u2018calm before the storm\u2019, ahead of tonight\u2019s election results. The polls are open, and despite what is expected to be an incredibly volatile 24 hours ahead, we have seen a remarkably calm start to the day for the FTSE 100... Amid a remarkable Corbyn resurgence in the polls, FTSE traders would do well to remember the confusion caused around the US election and EU referendum, where the predicted demise of stocks in the eventuality of a Trump win or Brexit really didn\u2019t come to fruition, catching many off-guard. Ultimately the worst eventuality here would be a hung parliament, given that Brexit negotiations are due to start in just 11 days. Britain\u2019s stock market is basically becalmed right now, with the FTSE 100 currently down 9 points at 7469. It has gained around 4.5% since today\u2019s general election was called in mid-April, so traders are now waiting to see if the pollsters have got this one right. The pound is also failing to provide any excitement, and is currently down 0.1% at $1.2945. With Britain\u2019s polling stations doing a brisk trade, City experts have been analysing how the results of today\u2019s vote will shift the markets. Here are some predictions from Mihir Kapadia of Sun Global Investments, who expects Theresa May to be returned with an increased majority. \u00b7 Conservative Win: This is largely expected, however, it is the scale of the victory that matters. If there is a landslide for the Conservatives, the markets will be stable, as they have already priced in for this scenario and thus there is not much leverage for it to rally further. The pound on the other hand will perform well over the news and can well trade over $1.3100. If there is a marginal victory, the markets will await for further clarity on the Brexit prospects and developments. So whichever the outcome in the Tory victory, the markets will be stable. \u00b7 Labour Win: This will be a major political upset but is highly unlikely. This could see pressure on the GBP and on Gilts in particular. UK shares may also decline though some sectors will gain on the back of expectations of higher government spending. \u00b7 Hung Parliament: This scenario is probably the most difficult for the markets, as it will could lead to a coalition government. This will also weaken the new government\u2019s position in handling the Brexit negotiations, and can be particularly damaging for the pound. Jeremy Cook of currency firm World First is predicting (or possible hoping for) a relatively quiet night: Craig Erlam, senior analyst at foreign exchange firm OANDA, says the pound will plunge if the election didn\u2019t provide a clear winner: From a markets perspective, this election is huge and could produce some substantial moves, particularly in sterling, the FTSE and UK debt. As we\u2019ve learned from similar events previously \u2013 Brexit, US election - not only is the outcome not always obvious but the market reaction can also catch people off guard and that\u2019s what\u2019s had traders acting with such caution all week. The most undesirable outcome is surely a hung parliament that produces both domestic political uncertainty and, more importantly, uncertainty and delays in Brexit negotiations. With the currently deadline being March 2019, any delay will be detrimental to the UK in negotiations and could therefore be devastating for sterling. While the knee jerk reaction to this may also be bad for the FTSE, as we saw after the EU referendum, we could see this bounce back quite quickly with the weaker currency benefiting its mostly outward facing companies. Britain\u2019s slowdown at the start of this year was due to faltering demand in the services sector, especially among businesses that relied on consumer spending. That\u2019s a sign that higher inflation, due to the weak pound, is hitting households. It also highlights the risks posed by Brexit, argues Ben Chu of the Independent. He writes: The UK\u2019s slump in GDP growth in the first quarter has been attributed by economists to a sharp slowdown in consumer spending, owing to the spike in inflation that has followed the drop in the pound in the wake of the Brexit vote last June. The UK\u2019s GDP growth rate is expected to pick up slightly in the next quarter, but most analysts believe that leaving the EU will set back the economy, with the damage depending on the nature and scope of future trade arrangements with the EU, our biggest trade partner. Some economists warn that a failure to secure any form of deal - a \u201ccliff-edge\u201d Brexit in 2019 - could cost the economy up to 9 per cent of GDP, relative to otherwise, by 2030. The UK has been growing more strongly than the rest of the EU for most of the past seven years but that partly reflects stronger population growth in the UK. The pound has shed its early gains, following the news that Britain was the slowest-growing member of the EU in the last quarter. Sterling is now hovering around $1.295, falling away from this morning\u2019s two-week high. Some early reaction to today\u2019s European growth figures: Breaking! The eurozone economy grew even faster than first thought at the start of this year. Statistics body Eurostat has just updated its figures, to show that GDP in the euro area expanded by 0.6% in January-to-March. That\u2019s up from an initial reading of 0.5%, and is the fastest growth in a year. The figures also show that Britain was the worst-performing member of the European Union in Q1, growing by just 0.2%. In contrast, Germany expanded by 0.6%, France and Italy grew by 0.4%, and many Eastern European states grew by over 1%. We shouldn\u2019t read too much into one quarter\u2019s figures, though. On an annual basis, the eurozone has expanded by 1.9%, which is actually a bit slower than Britain\u2019s 2% growth over the same period. But today\u2019s figures do underline how Europe\u2019s economy is (finally) gathering speed, helping to bring unemployment down across the region to the lowest levels since the debt crisis starter. This chart shows how the cost of insuring against the pound tumbling, or soaring, overnight has surged today - to the highest level since last year\u2019s EU referendum. We\u2019ve learned over the years that it\u2019s wise to treat opinion polls with caution, which is why traders are rather nervous today. Jasslyn Yeo, JP Morgan market strategist, says that younger voters (who typically have a lower turnout than older ones) could catch the City out. \u201cMarkets appear to be pricing in a Conservative Party majority victory. \u201cHowever, we still see much uncertainty surrounding the UK election, where a higher turnout vote of young people could potentially turn the tables on investors.\u201d Last week, YouGov showed the scale of the generational split in UK politics: Here\u2019s another chart showing how the markets might react to the UK election result: There will be drama in the markets if Theresa May doesn\u2019t manage to increase her majority today (she currently has a working majority of just 17). Marc Ostwald of ADM Investor Services reckons 40 is the magic number to avoid internal Tory party strife. Barring a surprise the key question is how large the Conservative majority might be, with anything below 40 seats likely to embolden the ever restive elements, whose penchant for internecine warfare is well documented, to embark on a fresh leadership challenge, given the incompetence of the party\u2019s campaign. Ostwald also pints out that the next UK government faces a very tough job: Even if a substantially larger majority is achieved, there is little doubt that it will make not a iota of difference to the EU\u2019s stance on Brexit negotiations, though it will heighten the risk that both sides continue to talk AT, rather than TO each other, and end in a complete breakdown. There is also little doubt that the UK economy is now facing some significant headwinds, above all consumers that are facing higher inflation, weak wage growth and the pressures associated with a far too rapid pace of credit growth, the more so given an increasingly soggy housing market, above all in the populous south east. London\u2019s stock market is rather subdued this morning, with the FTSE 100 dipping by a mere 3 points to 7473. Investors are sitting on their hands (or possibly nipping off to the polling booth), while they anticipate the three big events of today. Naeem Aslam of Think Markets says traders need to bring their \u201cA game\u201d to work today. Voters over in the UK are going to vote for their new Prime Minister, the European Central Bank will deliver their verdict about their monetary policy and James Comey will testify in front of senate. It is difficult to say which event will have create more volatility but it would be sensible thing to be ready for all kind of outcomes. The outcome of UK elections does matter because the new Prime minister will have arduous task ahead \u2013 the negotiation process of Brexit. Moreover, the winning candidate is not going to have a glittering economic prize because the country is facing significant slow growth, tepid wage gains and a currency which has its back broken and productivity issue which is cursed. City analysts believe the pound will rise over $1.30 if Theresa May increases her majority (which was the whole reason for calling the election). But a hung parliament could send sterling plunging by over six cents - a really sizeable move. Bloomberg has crunched forecasts from several investment banks: The cost of insuring against sharp swings in the value of the pound has soared today. That shows that City traders are preparing for sterling to move sharply when the exit polls are released at 10pm tonight. Here\u2019s the details via Reuters: STERLING/DOLLAR OVERNIGHT IMPLIED VOLATILITY JUMPS TO 30.75 PCT ON DAY OF UK ELECTION, HIGHEST SINCE JULY EURO-STERLING OVERNIGHT IMPLIED VOLATILITY HIGHEST SINCE BREXIT VOTE AT 31.55 Guardian Business has launched a daily email. Besides the key news headlines that you\u2019d expect, there\u2019ll be an at-a-glance agenda of the day\u2019s main events, insightful opinion pieces and a quality feature to sink your teeth into each day. For your morning shot of financial news, sign up here: Connor Campbell of SpreadEx agrees that sterling is getting a small lift from the general election: As Britain heads to the ballot box the markets got off to a relatively quiet start this Thursday, with the pound very gently building on yesterday\u2019s gains. Cable \u2013 which, despite some big swings, has been climbing since the beginning of June \u2013 rose another 0.2%, sending sterling to a its best price in a fortnight. Against the euro the pound has been less successful of late; nevertheless, despite being a long way from recovering the losses it has incurred since mid-May, a 0.1% increase has nudged the currency to a one and a half week peak. The pound is assumedly benefiting from the final round of polls, all of which \u2013 to varying degrees \u2013 point to a Tory win. The pound has hit a two-week high in early trading, as City investors anticipate a Conservative win in today\u2019s general election. Sterling has hit $1.2976, its highest level since 25 May, after the last wave of opinion polls suggested that Theresa May is heading back to Number 10 Downing Street with a larger majority. As this chart shows, the pound has been wallowing below $1.30 in mid-May, as the election campaign heated up and investors started wondering if Britain could end up with a hung parliament. But late last night, YouGov reported that the Conservatives have a seven-point lead over Labour: Sterling traders are now pricing a Theresa May victory, says FXTM chief market strategist Hussein Sayed: The higher the margin Conservatives win by, the more negotiation power May will have on Brexit terms, and the higher the Pound goes from here. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. They\u2019re calling it Triple Threat Thursday in the City. A pivotal day lies ahead, with plenty of political and economic drama in Europe and the US that could send the markets lurching. In the City, investors are on edge as Britain heads to the polling stations. The latest opinion polls point to a Conservative victory, and an increased majority for Theresa May -- but a shock result could have seismic impact on shares and the pound. It\u2019s also a big day for the European Central Bank as its governing council holds a monetary policy meeting. Investors had been expecting the ECB to take its first step towards tightening monetary policy, by tweaking the language in its outlook statement. However, leaks yesterday claimed that the ECB is actually going to revise down its inflation outlook -- making any exit from its stimulus programme even less likely. ECB president Mario Draghi will reveal all in his eagerly awaited press conference at lunchtime. We also get updated eurozone GDP figures, which could possibly see growth revised UP to 0.6% in the last quarter, from 0.5%, so it could be a volatile day for the euro. The third threat? Former FBI boss James Comey\u2019s testimony to Congress (from 3pm BST). It could be a historic event, with Comey facing questions from the Senate Intelligence Committee over the investigation into ties between president Trump and Russia. Our world affairs editor Julian Borger explains why it really really matters: When James Comey, the former FBI director, stands before a Senate committee on Thursday to give evidence about the president who fired him, it will be one of the most dramatic moments in US political history. The stakes will be as high as they have ever been at a congressional hearing. The questions Comey will be asked by the Senate intelligence committee include whether Donald Trump tried to persuade him to stop an investigation into improper contacts between a top adviser and Russian officials, whether Trump sought to extract a vow of personal loyalty, and whether Comey was fired because he did not comply. Trump has denied trying to make Comey drop the case, but if Comey contradicts him and is supported by other evidence, it would represent potential obstruction of justice by the president and mark a long leap down the road towards impeachment. Even in the Teapot Dome scandal that shook Warren Harding\u2019s administration in the early 1920s, and in the Watergate affair half a century later, it was not alleged that the president himself tried to intimidate an investigator.... More here: Comey\u2019s prepared statement has already set the scene, showing that president Donald Trump pressured him to shut down an investigation into a senior adviser\u2019s links to Russia.

The IMF has confirmed that the fund\u2019s managing director will attend next week\u2019s critical meeting of eurozone finance ministers as efforts intensify to resolve the rift over how to lighten the country\u2019s debt load. Helena Smith reports from Athens:</p> <blockquote> <p>Its official: Christine Lagarde will attend the June 15 eurogroup meeting in Luxembourg according to IMF spokesman Gerry Rice. Her presence now leaves the door open to the Fund approving a program \u201cin principle\u201d if the impasse over debt relief isn\u2019t resolved at the meeting \u2013 an effective get-out clause that would allow the EU more time to come to an agreement while emergency loans were disbursed to Greece in time for \u20ac7.5bn worth of debt repayments in July. The IMF has made clear it will not contribute to disbursements until a debt relief formula is devised permitting Largarde to make the case for further bailout participation before the body\u2019s board.</p> <p>\u201cWe would still be insisting on reforms and debt relief before the IMF would disburse any of its funds,\u201d Rice told reporters this afternoon. \u201cSo this is not a backing down or a walking away in any respect.\u201d</p> <p>The EU and IMF have been at loggerheads over how to make Greece\u2019s gargantuan debt load sustainable \u2013 a prerequisite for the ECB to accept the country into its stimulus programme. Earlier Thursday, the EU economic affairs commissioner Pierre Moscovici cautioned against \u201cplaying with fire\u201d saying it was vital a debt relief agreement was secured on June 15.</p> <p>Lagarde had stayed away from the last and inconclusive meeting of euro area finance ministers on May 22 amid concerns the country\u2019s debt crisis was poised to flare up again.</p> <p>The Greek prime minister Alexis Tsipras legislated further pension cuts and tax rises recently telling sceptical MPs a debt deal would be reached that would put Greece back on the road to economic recovery. Late on Wednesday he said EU investment programs should now be used to heal the rift between the EU and IMF by igniting the sort of growth that would bring concordance on debt relief.</p> <p>Citing data released by the labour ministry, the leftist leader told the inaugural European Concordia summit in Athens that indices were improving with 89,500 \u201creal jobs\u201d being created in May in addition to the 92,000 work places created in April.

This time around, all eyes were on the ECB\u2019s forward guidance on interest rates and the risk assessment for the economic outlook. On both, the ECB delivered some changes. As regards the forward guidance on interest rates, it was not about what the ECB said but what it actually didn\u2019t say. The ECB omitted the reference that interest rates could even be lower than their present levels and therefore dropped the easing bias for interest rates. Let\u2019s not forget, however, that at the same time, the ECB kept the easing bias on QE, sticking to the formulation that the ECB would be willing to step up its monthly asset purchases if need be. Also, Draghi remarked that the ECB will remain in the market for a long while and the QE tapering was not discussed at today\u2019s meeting. As regards the ECB\u2019s macro-economic assessment, the ECB upgraded the risk to the growth outlook from negative to now \u201cbroadly balanced\u201d. Actually the first time since 2011 that the ECB calls the outlook for growth balanced.</p> <p>The improved economic outlook, however, has not yet led to any significant inflationary pressure in the Eurozone. This picture was reflected in the ECB staff\u2019s economic projections which were marginally upgraded to 1.9% (during the Q&amp;A session, Draghi said that due to the upward revision of 1Q GDP, growth would actually now come in at 2%), 1.8% and 1.7% in 2017, 2018 and 2019 respectively. At the same time, the inflation projections were revised downwards to 1.5%, 1.3% and 1.6% for 2017, 2018 and 2019. Even though the downward revision was mainly the result of lower oil prices and a slightly stronger exchange rate, subdued inflation rates remain the biggest concern for the ECB. Reasons for low inflation rates are in our view not only the slack in the Eurozone economy, still high unemployment and a high number of (involuntary) part-time and low-wage employment but also globalisation and digitalisation. </p> <p>In our view, today\u2019s ECB meeting was a very first baby step towards eventual tapering. It is obvious that the ECB is trying to be as cautious as possible to very gradually get out of the unconventional monetary policy measures. Therefore, this process of preparing markets extremely carefully with words and changes in the communication will continue and can take a long while before the ECB delivers new action. In this context, the low inflation forecasts in our view argue in favour of only a mild tapering and probably a tapering without an end date on it. There is clearly room for another \u201clonger but lower\u201d announcement for 2018 later this year.</p> <p>All in all, the ECB today delivered two important linguistic changes to its official communication which were more than only words. These changes marked the official start of a taper tiptoeing. A tiptoeing which will still take a long while before it could be called policy normalisation.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-59394ec2e4b0bdd87e2f49da\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-06-08T13:34:13.811Z\">2.34pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Wall Street opens mixed</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>With the third element of Triple Threat Thursday - the testimony of ex-FBI head James Comey - due shortly, US markets have got off to an uncertain start.</p> <p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down just 5 points, while the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq Composite both edged higher.</p> <p>Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Following the release of James Comey\u2019s statement on Wednesday \u2013 which suggested Trump pressured him for a pledge of loyalty and implied his job was in peril if he didn\u2019t drop the Michael Flynn investigation \u2013 all eyes will be on the former FBI chief\u2019s testimony in front of the Senate intelligence committee.

The pound on the other hand will perform well over the news and can well trade over $1.3100. If there is a marginal victory, the markets will await for further clarity on the Brexit prospects and developments. So whichever the outcome in the Tory victory, the markets will be stable.<br></li> <li>\u00b7 <strong>Labour Win:</strong> This will be a major political upset but is highly unlikely. This could see pressure on the GBP and on Gilts in particular. UK shares may also decline though some sectors will gain on the back of expectations of higher government spending.<br></li> <li>\u00b7 <strong>Hung Parliament:</strong> This scenario is probably the most difficult for the markets, as it will could lead to a coalition government.

      "bodyText": "Growth forecasts revised up. Inflation forecasts revised down. Jobs being created. Take a bow Mario Draghi. Urged on by its proactive boss, the European Central Bank has achieved what looked impossible until recently: it has got the eurozone economy moving again. Draghi should milk the applause while he can because the eurozone\u2019s sweet spot won\u2019t last for ever. It didn\u2019t in the US and it didn\u2019t in the UK, two countries that pursued exactly the same macro-economic strategy as the ECB, only earlier. Like the US Federal Reserve and the Bank of England, the ECB has cut interest rates to the bone and cranked up the electronic printing presses. Moreover, Draghi plans to continue with the current plan for some time to come. True, the ECB\u2019s latest meeting in Tallinn, Estonia, decided that further interest rate cuts were no longer on the agenda and that the risks to the economic outlook were balanced rather than tilted to the downside. But there was not the remotest suggestion that borrowing costs were going to rise, nor that the ECB\u2019s quantitative easing programme would end \u2013 or even be tapered away \u2013 any time soon. Draghi wants to make absolutely sure that the recovery is assured and inflation is closer to its target before taking his foot off the pedal. Again, this follows the example of the Fed and the Bank of England. No question, the ECB is in a far better place than it was this time five years ago, when the economy was dipping in and out of recession, unemployment was rising and there were real fears that Italy and Spain would be the next dominoes to fall in Europe\u2019s debt crisis. The fact that they weren\u2019t was due to Draghi\u2019s insistence in July 2012 that the ECB would do \u201cwhatever it takes\u201d to defend the euro. It is clear, however, that ultra-low interest rates and QE are generating the same sort of labour market recovery as in the US and the UK: 5 million jobs have been created in the past three and a half years in the eurozone, but as Draghi admitted on Thursday many of them are low quality, part-time or temporary posts. That\u2019s why falling unemployment is not being accompanied by higher wages, and it is also why underlying inflation remains weak. Ultra loose monetary policy can only do so much: it is a painkiller not a cure.",

The fact that they weren\u2019t was due to Draghi\u2019s insistence in July 2012 that the ECB would do <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/jul/26/euro-irreversible-mario-draghi-ecb\">\u201cwhatever it takes\u201d </a>to defend the euro.<br></p> <p>It is clear, however, that ultra-low interest rates and QE are generating the same sort of labour market recovery as in the US and the UK: 5 million jobs have been created in the past three and a half years in the eurozone, but as Draghi admitted on Thursday many of them are low quality, part-time or temporary posts. That\u2019s why falling unemployment is not being accompanied by higher wages, and it is also why underlying inflation remains weak. Ultra loose monetary policy can only do so much: it is a painkiller not a cure. </p>",

      "bodyText": "The celebrity chef Gordon Ramsay has drafted in a specialist team of Brexit negotiators to tackle rising food costs at his restaurant empire. The Michelin-starred restaurateur, who runs some of Britain\u2019s top dining destinations including London\u2019s Savoy Grill and Petrus, is concerned about the fastest rise in food prices in three years. Accounts filed at Companies House for the chef\u2019s subsidiary company, Gordon Ramsay Holdings, sets out urgent action taken by the chain to cap food costs. It has recruited a buying team to negotiate cheaper prices across the group as the cost of imported ingredients spirals because of weak sterling. It also blamed concerns over recruiting staff on Brexit and is worried about uncertainty over the economy. In the accounts, for the 12 months to the end of August 2016, the firm warns: \u201cAs a consequence of the referendum in the summer of 2016 there is a great deal of uncertainty about the future direction of the economy. \u201cThis will have a number of potential implications including cost pressures due to the inflationary impact of sterling against the euro, recruitment and the general economic climate. \u201cIn part to mitigate the inflationary impact a procurement team has been recruited to manage the supply chain.\u201d The small group of buyers will haggle with suppliers to drive down the cost of ingredients across the group\u2019s chain of 31 restaurants. Previously venues were negotiating on a restaurant-by-restaurant basis and not benefiting from economies of scale. A spokesperson for Ramsay said the arrival of the new buying team was aimed at preventing prices from rising for customers. \u201cThe business model is aimed at avoiding regular and reactionary price changes to customers [to avoid] passing on inflationary and currency pressures,\u201d she said. \u201cFor example, the biggest currency exposure is on buying wine so we are working on our supply chain in order to mitigate the impact of fluctuations in sterling. This includes sourcing wines from around the world and using purchasing power better.\u201d Restaurants have been suffering from increased food prices, along with households up and down the country. The British Retail Consortium said food prices rose 1% over the past 12 months to March \u2013 the fastest rise in 3 years. Separately Kantar Worldpanel reported the price of everyday goods rose by 2.3% in the 12 weeks to 26 March. The pound has fallen 13% against the dollar since the Brexit vote. Despite the added pressures Gordon Ramsay Group managed to bounce back to profit for the first time in two years thanks to restructuring and international expansion. Last week the firm posted earnings of \u00a3739,000, up from a \u00a32m loss on sales of \u00a351.9m. On Wednesday Chris Hutcheson, Ramsay\u2019s father-in-law, who used to run the chain before a public falling out, was sentenced to six months in jail for hacking into the group\u2019s computer system.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Major financial firms will have traders and analysts stationed at their desks by 10pm on Thursday, in time for the exit polls which will give first indication of the result of the snap general election. With the market positioned for a Conservative victory, any early sign that Theresa May\u2019s party will loosen its grip on parliament will spark a market reaction. The pound will move first, as it trades round the clock in the 24-hour foreign exchange market. But shares and and government bonds will also be jolted as their markets open on Friday morning. Investors were surprised when May called the election on 18 April, with the FTSE 100 suffering its biggest fall since the vote for Brexit while sterling rallied, but most commentators expected the Tories would win convincingly, with some predicting a landslide. \u201cA somewhat unimpressive campaign from the Conservatives, plus a better showing from [Labour leader] Jeremy Corbyn than had been expected, have combined to make this campaign more of a contest than was likely six weeks ago,\u201d said analysts at financial firm IG. \u201cNonetheless it is clear that, barring a Brexit or Trump-style surprise, Theresa May will be returning to Downing Street at PM on Friday morning.\u201d After a flurry of activity when the exit poll is published, there will be a lull until the first seats are called. Analysts will be looking at the size of the Conservative majority in parliament - it is currently 17 seats - to determine any market moves, while a hung parliament or Labour victory would cause a more dramatic reaction. Increased Conservative majority As the markets are expecting the Conservatives to win, analysts at ING reckon the party\u2019s majority would need to increase if the pound is to move sharply from its current level of just below $1.30. \u201cWe need to see a Conservative majority of at least 50 to get a significant move higher\u201d in the pound, according to analysts at Dutch bank ING. A survey of economists by Bloomberg suggests sterling will rise to $1.3100 if the Conservatives achieve a large majority. Movement in the stock market is likely to be linked to sterling. Since the vote for Brexit, the FTSE 100 has been bolstered by the weaker pound as this benefits the international companies in the index. Analysts at JP Morgan, though, reckon the index could rise by as much as 2% despite stronger sterling on relief that the Conservatives have secured victory. The political ramifications for Brexit negotiations will also be scrutinised. Paul Hollingsworth, UK economist at Capital Economics, points to rumours of a cabinet reshuffle in the event of a strong victory for May. This could include Ben Gummer moving to the Brexit department. \u201cGiven that Gummer campaigned to \u2018remain\u2019, this might perhaps soften the government\u2019s stance somewhat in negotiations,\u201d said Hollingsworth. Reduced Conservative majority This could spark expectations that May will not survive as leader of the Conservative Party. Stefan Kreuzkamp, chief investment officer at Deutsche Asset Management, said: \u201cTory losses of the sort implied by some of the recent projections could fatally undermine the position of May as prime minister and party leader. Tory infighting could then easily result in a hard Brexit candidate taking over, increasing the risk of a Brexit with no alternative arrangement in place.\u201d Kathleen Brooks, research director at financial firm City Index, agreed that a slim majority will \u201carouse fears of a hard Brexit\u201d. \u201cThis could spook sterling traders,\u201d she said, calculating the pound could fall towards $1.25 \u2013 the level it was trading at before the election was called. But others take a different view, calculating that a weakened Conservative party could soften Brexit as it would require more political compromise between the parties. The Bloomberg poll reflects these differences, showing a sterling rally \u2013 to $1.3025. A hung parliament \u201cAll hell could break loose metaphorically speaking, at least at first,\u201d said Berenberg\u2019s senior UK economist, Kallum Pickering. The Bloomberg poll puts sterling at $1.2350 in this scenario. Brooks points to a delay the Brexit negotiations, which she said could drive the pound to $1.20. \u201cIn this scenario we would expect a sharp drop in the pound and the FTSE 100. While we would expect the FTSE 100 to recover in the short term, we could see \u00a3/$ fall back towards 1.20,\u201d she said. \u201cSterling has been the conduit through which traders have expressed concern over Brexit, thus we would expect the pound to suffer the most if there is no clear winner,\u201d she said. Guy Foster, head of research at Brewin Dolphin, said the FTSE 100 could benefit as the international companies in the index will benefit from the pound\u2019s weakness. Hollingsworth at Capital Economics reckons the index may not sustain its rally, though. \u201cWe are not convinced that equity prices would continue to rise, given the political uncertainty,\u201d said Hollingsworth. A Labour victory In this scenario, Bloomberg\u2019s poll predicts sterling would reach $1.2484. Brooks expects an initial decline in sterling and in UK share prices \u201con the back of investor fears about Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s leftwing agenda\u201d, but she reckons that in the longer term the markets should have little to fear. \u201cStock market gains under a Labour government aren\u2019t unheard of ... under Tony Blair\u2019s premiership, the FTSE 100 rallied nearly 50%,\u201d she said. Pledges in the Labour manifesto that energy companies will be taken back into public ownership, the privatisation of Royal Mail will be reversed and a consultation will take place on breaking up Royal Bank of Scotland may rattle the stock market. Labour also wants to increase corporation tax to 26% in 2020 from 19%, which could also knock sentiment on the stock market. But currency experts at Dutch bank ING see some support for sterling. They said: \u201cIf a credible Labour-led coalition can be formed quickly, then we are likely to see markets price in greater odds of a softer Brexit deal and this could arguably help the pound recover from any initial sell-off. From the currency\u2019s perspective, this channel is likely to outweigh any questions over Labour\u2019s economic policies.\u201d Hollingsworth reckons there would be a reaction in government bonds, known as gilts, because of expectations that Labour would loosen fiscal policy. Gilt yields \u2013 which move inversely to price \u2013 could rise from their low levels, according to analysts at JP Morgan.",

Tory infighting could then easily result in a hard Brexit candidate taking over, increasing the risk of a Brexit with no alternative arrangement in place.\u201d</p> <p>Kathleen Brooks, research director at financial firm City Index, agreed that a slim majority will \u201carouse fears of a hard Brexit\u201d. \u201cThis could spook sterling traders,\u201d she said, calculating the pound could fall towards $1.25 \u2013 the level it was trading at before the election was called.</p> <p>But others take a different view, calculating that a weakened Conservative party could soften Brexit as it would require more political compromise between the parties. <br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>The Bloomberg poll reflects these differences, showing a sterling rally \u2013 to $1.3025.</p> <h2>A hung parliament</h2> <p>\u201cAll hell could break loose metaphorically speaking, at least at first,\u201d said Berenberg\u2019s senior UK economist, Kallum Pickerin<em>g. </em></p> <p>The Bloomberg poll puts sterling at $1.2350 in this scenario.</p> <p>Brooks points to a delay the Brexit negotiations, which she said could drive the pound to $1.20.</p> <p>\u201cIn this scenario we would expect a sharp drop in the pound and the FTSE 100. While we would expect the FTSE 100 to recover in the short term, we could see \u00a3/$ fall back towards 1.20,\u201d she said. \u201cSterling has been the conduit through which traders have expressed concern over Brexit, thus we would expect the pound to suffer the most if there is no clear winner,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Guy Foster, head of research at Brewin Dolphin, said the FTSE 100 could benefit as the international companies in the index will benefit from the pound\u2019s weakness. Hollingsworth at Capital Economics reckons the index may not sustain its rally, though. \u201cWe are not convinced that equity prices would continue to rise, given the political uncertainty,\u201d said Hollingsworth.</p> <h2>A Labour victory</h2> <p>In this scenario, Bloomberg\u2019s poll predicts sterling would reach $1.2484. Brooks expects an initial decline in sterling and in UK share prices \u201con the back of investor fears about Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s leftwing agenda\u201d, but she reckons that in the longer term the markets should have little to fear. \u201cStock market gains under a Labour government aren\u2019t unheard of ... under Tony Blair\u2019s premiership, the FTSE 100 rallied nearly 50%,\u201d she said.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Pledges <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/may/11/do-the-public-support-labours-rail-post-and-tuition-fees-policies\">in the Labour manifesto</a> that energy companies will be taken back into public ownership, the privatisation of Royal Mail will be reversed and a consultation will take place on breaking up Royal Bank of Scotland may rattle the stock market. Labour also wants to increase corporation tax to 26% in 2020 from 19%, which could also knock sentiment on the stock market.</p> <p>But currency experts at Dutch bank ING see some support for sterling. They said: \u201cIf a credible Labour-led coalition can be formed quickly, then we are likely to see markets price in greater odds of a softer Brexit deal and this could arguably help the pound recover from any initial sell-off. From the currency\u2019s perspective, this channel is likely to outweigh any questions over Labour\u2019s economic policies.\u201d</p> <p>Hollingsworth reckons there would be a reaction in government bonds, known as gilts, because of expectations that Labour would loosen fiscal policy. Gilt yields \u2013 which move inversely to price \u2013 could rise from their low levels, according to analysts at JP Morgan.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The shadow of the 2008 financial crisis loomed over the banking sector again on Wednesday when a Spanish lender was rescued from collapse by Santander and Royal Bank of Scotland racked up a \u00a31bn bill to end a legal battle sparked by the bailouts by UK taxpayers nearly a decade ago. The European authorities deployed new rules for the first time to allow Santander to rescue its ailing rival, Banco Popular. Popular is the sixth biggest bank in Spain and has been weighed down by the legacy of bad lending decisions made in the run-up to the financial crisis. Santander \u2013 a household name in the UK after its takeover of Abbey National, Alliance &amp; Leicester and Bradford &amp; Bingley \u2013 paid just \u20ac1 to take over Popular but tapped its shareholders for \u20ac7bn (\u00a36bn) to cover the bad debts facing the lender. The deal took place hours before the markets opened on Wednesday after an eleventh-hour rescue deal put together by the eurozone\u2019s new banking body, the Single Resolution Board (SRB). It was triggered by the European Central Bank, which had declared that Banco Popular was \u201cfailing or likely to fail\u201d \u2013 the first time a eurozone bank had been given this classification. Elke K\u00f6nig, chair of the SRB, made clear the deal avoided a repeat of the 2008 crisis when taxpayers were forced to bail out banks. \u201cThe decision taken today safeguards the depositors and critical functions of Banco Popular. This shows that the tools given to resolution authorities after the crisis are effective to protect taxpayers\u2019 money from bailing out banks,\u201d said K\u00f6nig. It was a first major use of the new regime and Ana Bot\u00edn, chair of Santander, said: \u201cThis deal is good for Spain and it\u2019s good for Europe\u201d. She told Bloomberg that she felt \u201cabsolutely no pressure at all\u201d from politicians to rescue Popular. The troubled Popular, weighed down by almost \u20ac40bn of bad loans, had been seeking a buyer since March. The deal has meant that shareholders have been wiped out, as were some classes of bondholders. As the markets were digesting the implications of the Spanish rescue, a high court in London was also crawling over the 2008 crisis, as RBS took steps to avoid a bruising encounter with shareholders that had threatened to force Fred Goodwin to give evidence. The case, brought by 9,000 retail investors and a handful of major institutions, dated from April 2008. They claimed they were misled by the former RBS boss, three former directors and the bank itself when they backed a \u00a312bn cash call. The bank was bailed out six months later leaving them nursing heavy losses. The case, which had been due to start on 22 May, had been subjected to a number of adjournments after a last-minute settlement offer from RBS. When the court resumed on Wednesday, the judge agreed to halt the long-running battle. However, in an unexpected twist, Mr Justice Hildyard left open the door for the case to be revived as 13% of the investors who were part of the case had yet to agree to the out-of-court deal. The legal battle has cost RBS about \u00a31bn \u2013 an estimated \u00a3900m in settlements to shareholders and \u00a3100m in legal fees. RBS had settled with 87% of the investors, which had made claims before this case began, and the judge said ending it had not proved easy. \u201cIn a difficult and novel situation, the process of bringing an end is not as easy as might be thought,\u201d said Hildyard, who has called for a review of the way such complex lawsuits are brought. The judge has said he wants to know by the end of July if those who do not settle want to resume the trial. To do so, they would need to prove they have the funding. While Goodwin looks likely to escape a court hearing, Rachel Reeves, who was a Labour MP on the Treasury select committee before the election was called, raised the prospect of the former RBS chief executive being called to parliament.",
