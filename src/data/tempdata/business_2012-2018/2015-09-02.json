The former Tatler journalist, who launched the company selling designer clothes from her Chelsea flat, leaves with more than \u00a3100m cash after selling her stake in the company, according to Bloomberg. Yoox, an Italian online retailer, agreed to buy Net-a-Porter from its current owners Richemont, the luxury fashion group, in March. The deal, which has just been cleared by European competition regulators, creates a global fashion giant with sales of more than \u20ac1.3bn. Yoox said in a statement: \u201cFollowing Natalie Massenet\u2019s tendering of her resignation as executive chairman of the Net-a-Porter Group, Ms Massenet will not be a member of the board of directors of the new group, which will result from the upcoming merger.\u201d Massenet was due to be the merged company\u2019s executive chairman with Federico Marchetti, Yoox\u2019s founder, as chief executive. Fashion insiders said Massenet, who only last month said she was planning to stay on at Net-a-Porter after the merger, was unhappy at the prospect of playing second fiddle to Marchetti. Analysts said her role amounted to being a \u201cgroup ambassador\u201d with few direct responsibilities. She said: \u201cAs for my own future, my entrepreneurial drive is as strong today asit always has been, and my passion for innovation will continue to be my greatest guide in business.\u201d Now chair of the British Fashion Council, Massenet started her career at US fashion trade journal Women\u2019s Wear Daily before moving on to Tatler, where she worked with celebrated fashionista Isabella Blow. She left in 1998 to go freelance before launching Net-a-Porter in 2000 with the backing of her then husband. Exploiting the emerging internet shopping trend, Net-a-Porter expanded to include French, German and Chinese versions of its site and now delivers its merchandise, wrapped in fine tissue paper, beautifully boxed and tied up in ribbon, in 170 countries.",

      "bodyText": "Royal Dutch Shell has got the thumbs up from the European commission for its \u00a355bn takeover of BG Group. That is two regulatory hurdles cleared, three to go. At that point, harder questions can be asked. Does this cash and shares deal, unveiled in early April, which feels like a different era for the oil market, still make sense? And will Shell shareholders back it? The second question is easier to answer. Fund managers only squash big deals in extreme circumstances. Fred Goodwin and Royal Bank of Scotland, for heaven\u2019s sake, received overwhelming backing in 2007 to buy the worst slice of ABN Amro even as credit markets started to turn icy. At Shell, the chief executive, Ben van Beurden, has staked his reputation on the BG purchase and a rebellion would amount to a vote of no confidence in the board of one of the FTSE 100\u2019s biggest companies. That drama, almost certainly, is not going to happen. But there is always the possibility that Shell could choose to walk away and pay \u00a3750m as a break fee. At today\u2019s $49 (\u00a332) for a barrel of Brent crude, the acquisition arithmetic looks less than compelling. At announcement in April, the takeover premium for BG was 50%, a price that seemed to make sense only if the oil price rebounded to $70 to $90 a barrel in reasonably short order. Indeed, Shell seemed to concede that point in the early days. Only later has the company argued, less than convincingly, that the numbers still work at current prices. BG shares are trading almost 13% below the value of Shell\u2019s terms, reflecting nervousness among its investors. Adjust for Shell\u2019s to-be-paid dividends and the gap is closer to 11%, calculates Barclays, but that is still hefty for a deal due to complete in the first quarter of next year. Barring another sustained fall in oil prices, Van Beurden is probably safe to plough on. But this purchase looks a long way from being the opportunistic piece of deal-making, which was the spin in April. One third of takeover price is cash and, make no mistake, a 50% takeover premium is hard to explain if it turns out you were not negotiating at the bottom of the market. It is too soon to say the deal is in trouble, but it is a long way from being done. Costly dividend weighs down Glencore For what feels like the umpteenth day in a row, the worst-performing FTSE 100 stock was Glencore. Yesterday\u2019s 8% fall to a new low of 123p means Ivan Glasenberg\u2019s mining-cum-trading combine has lost a quarter of its stock market value since half-year figures a fortnight ago. Back in 2013, Glencore was worth $65bn when it completed its takeover of Xstrata; now it is valued at $25bn. Viewed another way, the shares are 77% lower than 2011\u2019s flotation price. Whatever Glasenberg is telling investors during his current post-results roadshow about his flexibility to cut debts of $47bn (or $29bn if one deducts trading inventories), it is not working. A bearish industry-wide note from Bank of America Merrill Lynch\u2019s analysts has not helped. The number-crunchers reckon about $60bn is required to reinforce balance sheets in the sector. In Glencore\u2019s case, they calculated the shares are worth 42p at current spot commodity prices, and zero under a \u201cdoom and gloom\u201d scenario. An alternative view is that Glencore\u2019s debt mountain would look a lot less daunting if the prices of coal and copper, the company\u2019s two big products, rebound only modestly. That script, though, would seem to require a pickup in demand from China. Unfortunately, even Glasenberg, famed for his market-reading nous, offered little clarity on that score a fortnight ago. \u201cAt the moment none of us can read China,\u201d he said. \u201cNone of us know what is going on there and I\u2019m yet to find the guy who can predict China correctly.\u201d Instead, his report contained a long grumble about the \u201caggressive and synchronised\u201d short-selling tactics of Chinese funds in the copper market. Full marks for frankness. But, as one fund manager points out, why on earth, in these circumstances, would you simultaneously maintain a dividend that costs $2.2bn a year? Walkie Talkie \u2013 the ugly truth The Walkie Talkie, the hideous bulging office block on Fenchurch Street in the City of London, richly deserves its award of the Carbuncle Cup for worst building of the year. The belated addition of shading devices now prevents cars and pedestrians from being fried on sunny summer days. But nothing can stop the Walkie Talkie ruining the City skyline and, disgracefully, dominating views of Tower Bridge. What were City planners smoking when they granted building permission? By way of small compensation, let\u2019s hope the Carbuncle Cup injects a dose of humility into the boardroom of Land Securities, which developed the monstrosity with Canary Wharf Group. The front page of last year\u2019s annual report was embossed with the gushing opinion of a tame tenant: \u201cOur people felt a foot taller the day we moved in.\u201d Dear Land Securities, the rest of us hate the Walkie Talkie \u2013 and the tower has destroyed any claim you had to being a sensitive developer.",

      "bodyText": "Burger King is refusing to give up on its attempt to release a showpiece burger in conjunction with rival fast-food chains to mark the United Nations\u2019 International Day of Peace, despite being publicly rebuffed by McDonald\u2019s. A week after asking its rival for a ceasefire in their \u201cburger wars\u201d by creating a special McWhopper burger for the occasion, Burger King has now invited four other US fast-food chains to help create a \u201cpeace day burger\u201d. In an open letter to Denny\u2019s, Wayback Burgers, Krystal, and Giraffas, Burger King said it had received a \u201csignificant number of unexpected responses from other restaurants, large and small\u201d after its initial proposal to create a \u201cpeace burger\u201d was pointedly rejected by McDonald\u2019s. The company said it wanted to merge the \u201cindividual proposals\u201d it had received from its four rivals into one burger, which it will sell on world peace day, on 21 September, from a pop-up restaurant already under construction. The letter from Burger King was published a week after it booked full-page adverts in major US newspapers to ask long-time rival McDonald\u2019s to cooperate on the creation of the McWhopper. The burger would have combined elements of McDonald\u2019s Big Mac and Burger King\u2019s Whopper. However, the advert was greeted with a withering response from Steve Easterbrook, chief executive of McDonald\u2019s. \u201cWe love the intention but think our two brands could do something bigger to make a difference,\u201d Easterbrook wrote on Facebook. \u201cWe commit to raise awareness worldwide, perhaps you\u2019ll join us in a meaningful global effort? And every day, let\u2019s acknowledge that between us there is simply a friendly business competition and certainly not the unequalled circumstances of the real pain and suffering of war.\u201d Easterbrook added the disdainful postscript to his statement: \u201cP.S. A simple phone call will do next time.\u201d Burger King\u2019s latest open letter was also addressed to McDonald\u2019s and insists the initial offer remains on the table. \u201cAlthough they haven\u2019t yet agreed to come on board, our original proposal still stands. McDonald\u2019s, please take your time. We\u2019re totally at peace with that,\u201d it read. Burger King has said the proceeds from the burger will go to Peace One Day, a not-for-profit organisation raising awareness of the UN\u2019s International Day of Peace. It has asked its four rivals to make a donation to the organisation in order to go ahead with the burger.",

The burger would have combined elements of McDonald\u2019s Big Mac and Burger King\u2019s Whopper.</p> <p>However, the advert was greeted with a withering response from Steve Easterbrook, chief executive of McDonald\u2019s. \u201cWe love the intention but think our two brands could do something bigger to make a difference,\u201d <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/McDonalds/posts/10156031225440584\">Easterbrook wrote on Facebook</a>.</p> <p>\u201cWe commit to raise awareness worldwide, perhaps you\u2019ll join us in a meaningful global effort? And every day, let\u2019s acknowledge that between us there is simply a friendly business competition and certainly not the unequalled circumstances of the real pain and suffering of war.\u201d</p> <p>Easterbrook added the disdainful postscript to his statement: \u201cP.S. A simple phone call will do next time.\u201d</p> <p>Burger King\u2019s latest open letter was also addressed to McDonald\u2019s and insists the initial offer remains on the table. \u201cAlthough they haven\u2019t yet agreed to come on board, our original proposal still stands. McDonald\u2019s, please take your time. We\u2019re totally at peace with that,\u201d it read.</p> <p>Burger King has said the proceeds from the burger will go to Peace One Day, a not-for-profit organisation raising awareness of the UN\u2019s International Day of Peace. It has asked its four rivals to make a donation to the organisation in order to go ahead with the burger.</p>",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "A US government-appointed agricultural body tried to crush a Silicon Valley food startup after concluding the company represented a \u201cmajor threat\u201d and \u201ccrisis\u201d for the $5.5bn-a-year egg industry, according to documents obtained by the Guardian. In potential conflict with rules that govern how it can spend its funds, the American Egg Board (AEB) lobbied for a concerted attack on Hampton Creek, a food company that has created a low-cost plant-based egg replacement and the maker of Just Mayo, a mayonnaise alternative. In a series of emails obtained under the Freedom of Information Act (Foia), AEB staff, a US department of agriculture official and egg industry executives attempted to orchestrate the attack. The documents were obtained by Ryan Shapiro, a Foia expert at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and Shapiro\u2019s Washington DC-based Foia-specialist attorney, Jeffrey Light, and passed to Hampton Creek. Among the efforts coordinated between the AEB, the USDA and the egg industry: Outgoing AEB head Joanne Ivy advised Unilever on how to proceed against Hampton Creek after the food giant filed a false advertising lawsuit against its rival last year. The Department of Agriculture\u2019s national supervisor of shell eggs joined the AEB in its attack on Hampton Creek, suggesting Ivy contact the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) directly about Just Mayo with her concerns. The FDA later ruled Just Mayo must change its name. The AEB attempted to have Just Mayo blocked from Whole Foods, asking Anthony Zolezzi, a partner at private equity firm Pegasus Capital Advisors and self-described \u201ceco-entrepreneur\u201d, to use his influence with Whole Foods to drop the product. (Whole Foods still sells Just Mayo.) More than one member of the AEB made joking threats of violence against Hampton Creek\u2019s founder, Josh Tetrick. \u201cCan we pool our money and put a hit on him?\u201d asked Mike Sencer, executive vice-president of AEB member organization Hidden Villa Ranch. Mitch Kanter, executive vice-president of the AEB, jokingly offered \u201cto contact some of my old buddies in Brooklyn to pay Mr. Tetrick a visit\u201d. The AEB\u2019s research arm, the Egg Nutrition Center (ENC), tested the strength of Hampton Creek\u2019s patent for its egg replacer, Beyond Eggs, using a consultant, Gilbert Leveille. Leveille concluded that the patent was \u201cnot very strong and could be easily challenged with an alternate product\u201d, he said in an email to Kanter. \u201cWere I in your position I would focus on nutritional quality and on the emerging science, much of which ENC has sponsored,\u201d Leveille wrote. The emails, totalling 600 pages, show the AEB has become deeply concerned about Hampton Creek. The San Francisco-based tech company has attracted $120m in funding from some of tech\u2019s biggest names, including the Founders Fund, started by Facebook backer Peter Thiel, and Vinod Khosla\u2019s Khosla Ventures. The AEB represents egg farmers across the US and its board is selected by the secretary of agriculture. This year the politically connected AEB provided 14,000 eggs for the White House\u2019s annual Easter egg roll and Ivy was photographed with President Barack Obama. Hampton Creek has recently signed a deal with Compass, the world\u2019s largest catering company, and is pursuing contracts with other fast-food and food supply companies that have traditionally been held by the egg industry. \u201cMissy, I am getting a lot of emails about this product from egg producers,\u201d Ivy wrote in an email to Missy Maher, an executive at the Edelman public relations company, in August 2013. She said it \u201cwould be a good idea if Edelman looked at this product as a crisis and major threat to the future of the egg product business\u201d. Unilever \u2013 maker of Hellman\u2019s mayonnaise \u2013 sued Hampton Creek in November 2014, arguing Just Mayo was falsely named because it contained no eggs. Unilever dropped the suit last December. Emails show Ivy gave advice to people representing Unilever. \u201cI just got off the phone with a guy working with the Unilever case with Hampton Creek,\u201d Ivy wrote in an email to Howard Magwire, head of government relations for the agricultural cooperative United Egg Producers. \u201cHe wanted me to say that we supported Unilever in this lawsuit against Hampton Creek, but I told him that we could not take a position. However, since the regulation requires egg in mayo and the product does not, I said that they should make sure the FDA is aware to address this situation. I feel sure they are aware, but maybe they need to be pushed.\u201d The previous day, Ivy had written: \u201cOh, I believe I mentioned in an email yesterday that the counsel from Unilever called. If not, I am mentioning it now. I believe I provided him some basic information that was helpful but let him know that AEB cannot make statements that would support Unilever\u2019s position.\u201d Both emails were sent in November 2014, while the litigation between Unilever and Hampton Creek was ongoing. Before the discussion with Unilever, the Department of Agriculture (USDA) had already suggested ways to put pressure on Hampton Creek. In January 2014, Roger Glasshoff, then the USDA\u2019s head of shell eggs, told Ivy to contact the FDA about Just Mayo directly. \u201cI would forward the information to the FDA District Office responsible for the location where the product was marketed,\u201d Glasshoff wrote. \u201cI believe that many labels currently in commerce do not comply with the FDA\u2019s labeling policy.\u201d Last month the FDA ruled that Just Mayo could not be called mayonnaise because it does not contain eggs. Tetrick, the Hampton Creek founder, said he found the emails \u201cquite shocking\u201d, but that they didn\u2019t faze him. \u201cI\u2019m not entirely surprised that some industries that are lost in the past a little bit are fighting so hard,\u201d he said. \u201cEven though it was joking, some of those notes about putting a hit out \u2013 that\u2019s some reckless stuff.\u201d With respect to the FDA\u2019s instruction to change the name of Just Mayo, Tetrick said the product\u2019s moniker was here to stay. \u201cWe don\u2019t have any plans on changing the name,\u201d he said. \u201cNames matter, and they influence people. We want to connect to the everyday person who\u2019s shopping at the Dollar Tree or shopping at Walmart.\u201d In a statement to the Guardian, Ivy said: \u201cAnthony Zolezzi has never conducted any work on behalf of the American Egg Board; thus he was never paid for any services. The American Egg Board did not take a position on the Unilever and Hampton Creek lawsuit and did not contact the FDA regarding Just Mayo.\u201d Ivy further wrote: \u201cAt the American Egg Board, our singular focus is on supporting the American egg farmer and communicating the value of the incredible edible egg\u2122. Eggs remain all-natural and are packed with a number of nutrients, including high-quality protein. In fact, the quality of egg protein is so high that scientists often use eggs as the standard for measuring the protein quality of other foods.\u201d With respect to Kanter\u2019s joke about his Brooklyn buddies, Ivy said: \u201cWe are aware of the comments made by an American Egg Board employee. While these comments were clearly made in jest, they were inappropriate and do not reflect our organization\u2019s values. We apologize for any offense.\u201d The law that created the Egg Board says that \u201cno funds collected by the Egg Board under the order shall in any manner be used for the purpose of influencing governmental policy or action\u201d. AEB is funded by a levy of 20 cents per case of eggs sold by its constituent members. A USDA spokesman said: \u201cBy law, USDA\u2019s agricultural marketing service [the division that employed Glasshoff, then the USDA\u2019s head of shell eggs] is charged with providing oversight, ensuring fiscal responsibility, program efficiency, and fair treatment of participating stakeholders. AMS does not condone any efforts to limit competing products in commerce. \u201cThe national shell egg supervisor in AMS regularly fields questions from those seeking regulatory and labeling guidance. The national shell egg supervisor has no role in the oversight of the American Egg Board. In this case, he fielded a call about a regulatory question and simply referred the inquirer to the correct regulatory authority. In reviewing documents, AMS has not discovered any inappropriate actions by the now retired national shell egg supervisor that would fall outside of his responsibilities,\u201d he said. \u2022 This story was updated on 3 September 2015 with a comment from USDA that was emailed after publication.",

New guidance from the Financial Conduct Authority, the financial watchdog, means that for the first time, Sports Direct\u2019s executive deputy chairman, Mike Ashley, who owns a 55% stake in the company he founded, can be challenged by other investors. Before the vote on 9 September, some key shareholder advisory groups are calling on investors to vote against Hellawell, 73, who admitted last year that Ashley ran the business with three or four key executives and had informed the board of some key decisions only at the last moment. The Trade Union Share Owners (TUSO) group, a coalition of pension funds for trade unions including the TUC, Unite and Unison, has written to the top 20 investors in the company, which employs thousands of workers on controversial zero-hours contracts, urging them to vote out Hellawell. It says Hellawell has failed to tackle bad employment practices at Sports Direct. It also criticises Hellawell for a lack of knowledge and oversight of the collapse of part of USC, a subsidiary of Sports Direct, where 200 workers were laid off at the start of this year with just 15 minutes notice. At a select committee inquiry last year, MPs accused Sports Direct of behaving like a \u201cbackstreet outfit\u201d in its treatment of suppliers and staff. In the wake of that meeting, the Institute of Directors warned that Sports Direct\u2019s board was \u201cdysfunctional\u201d and does not provide a sufficient check on Ashley\u2019s powers. Hellawell, who was previously chief constable of West Yorkshire police and was the Tony Blair government\u2019s drugs tsar, became chairman of Sports Direct in 2009. PIRC, the shareholder advisory group, is also advising investors to vote against the re-election of Hellawell. It warns of a lack of communication among members of Sports Direct\u2019s board \u201cwhich puts into question the competency of the board as whole\u201d. \u201cWe are concerned that the chair\u2019s responsibilities have been poorly managed,\u201d PIRC said. It recommends shareholders oppose the re-election of Ashley as executive deputy chair and abstain on the re-election of the senior independent director, Simon Bentley. It also raises concerns about changes to a company-wide share bonus scheme, which would lower the profit target for the current financial year by \u00a360m. Frances O\u2019Grady, general secretary of the TUC, said: \u201cShareholders and workers both have an interest in reform at Sports Direct. We all want to see a successful business, but this success needs to be built on strong governance and good employment practices, not zero-hours contracts.\u201d Glass Lewis, the influential investment adviser, says shareholders should re-elect Hellawell. However, it advises investors vote against all the other non-executive directors \u2013 Bentley, Dave Singleton and Claire Jenkins \u2013 because of concerns over excessive non-audit fees. It said the firm\u2019s auditor, Grant Thornton, was paid more for non-audit services than in auditing fees and that \u201craises concerns about the objectivity\u201d. The new FCA rules, which govern companies that have a controlling shareholder with a stake of 30% or more, mean the election of non-executive directors must be approved separately by minority shareholders. The rules came into force in May 2014 but did not affect Sports Direct\u2019s last annual shareholder meeting because companies were given six months to comply. Last year, just 16% of independent shareholders did not back Hellawell although some major investors are understood to have privately expressed disquiet at his continued presence. If the majority of independent shareholders vote against Hellawell\u2019s re-election, or that of other non-executives, Sports Direct will have the option of calling a special shareholder meeting at which all investors\u2019 votes will be counted together. That would enable Ashley to push through their re-election. Paul Hewitt at Manifest, the shareholder advisory service, said: \u201cThese rules may not ultimately prevent a company from barrelling through with what they want, but they do make it more expensive and complicated, and they will have to do so in the public eye. It increases accountability and transparency.\u201d He said the new rules made it clearer who was backing directors. Fashion empire Sports Direct has bought a 25% stake in Four Marketing, the company which distributes fashionable brands including Orla Kiely, 7 For All Mankind and Stone Island in the UK. The investment is not unusual for Mike Ashley\u2019s empire, which has moved beyond its discount sportswear heartland to open more than 103 premium fashion stores under the Flannels, Cruise, USC and Van Mildert names. Over the years, it has also snapped up an array of sports and fashion brands including Dunlop, Slazenger, Kangol and Firetrap as it bids to secure access to attractive labels for its stores. Industry insiders told trade journal Drapers that Sports Direct might help Four Marketing expand its new retail format.",

    "webTitle": "Swansea Bay tidal energy scheme strives to generate waves of optimism", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Tyrone O\u2019Sullivan is not an obvious evangelist for the vast Swansea Bay tidal lagoon project, lauded by its developers as world leading but dismissed by one critic as Britain\u2019s \u201cpottiest ever\u201d renewable energy project. The 69-year-old is, after all, chairman of a local coal mining company and a former flying picket during the miners\u2019 strike in 1984, and can happily describe environmentalists as \u201ca pain in the arse\u201d. But sitting in his comfortable chalet near the seaside village of Mumbles in south-west Wales, O\u2019Sullivan is keen to extol the virtues of developing tidal power close to Wales\u2019s second largest city. \u201cThe scheme will be spectacular. It would be the equivalent of the Sydney Opera House or the London Eye for us even if it did not produce any electricity, which it certainly will,\u201d argued the former branch secretary of the National Union of Mineworkers. O\u2019Sullivan, partially disabled from a lifetime of extracting coal underground, is talking about the \u00a31bn sea scheme that will require the building of a six-mile sea wall and the installation of 16 underwater turbines. Renewable energy supporters and coal enthusiasts are not easy bedfellows given the former is basically being subsidised to replace the latter, albeit in a bid to cut carbon and tackle global warming. O\u2019Sullivan is particularly keen on the 1,900 construction jobs, but it is a far cry from a coal-fired power station \u2013 it would provide a sailing and visitor centre as well as enough power for 155,000 homes. \u201cI am not convinced by wind energy and I hate [low] prices for electricity when I get low prices for our coal but I am so excited for what it [the tidal lagoon] will bring to Swansea and my grandchildren,\u201d he said, pointing to a small girl cooking in the kitchen with his wife, Elaine. It is the same across town at the headquarters of Neath Port Talbot council, where its chief executive, Steve Phillips, said there is huge local support for the former coal and steel region becoming a leader in marine power. \u201cWe have not had an opportunity like this for 20 or 30 years. We have seen Cardiff benefit from the redevelopment of its bay area and we similarly want to have windows for investors to peer through. That is what the new university campus here provides and what a Swansea lagoon project would do,\u201d he argued. The project would take three years to build but have a design life of 120 years beyond that. Electricity would be generated by 320MW-capacity turbines propelled by the tide. The scheme is billed as a world first, but a similar \u2013 though different \u2013 tidal scheme has operated for 45 years at La Rance in north-western France. The Welsh secretary, Stephen Crabb, is unsurprisingly a fan but so is the prime minister, David Cameron, according to Mark Shorrock, chief executive of Tidal Lagoon Power, and the man at the centre of the scheme. Although the project was in the Conservative party manifesto, at a time when the government has been taking an axe to subsidies provided for solar and wind power, there are many who believe the Swansea Bay site will never be anything but a beach. Mandarins from the Department of Energy and Climate Change (DECC) and the Treasury are poring over the details before deciding whether it should be funded though a \u2018contract for difference\u2019 scheme. The cost of lagoon power \u2013 a predicted \u00a3168 per MW/hour \u2013 is considerably higher than for offshore wind, or the \u00a392.50 for nuclear. The project has already been dubbed potty and the Daily Mail has predicted it is in line for the chop \u2013 the newspaper\u2019s columnist, Christopher Booker, argued that Swansea would produce \u201ceasily the most expensive electricity in the world\u201d. But Shorrock, who claims to have already spent \u00a326m, including \u00a37m of his own money, on the scheme, is confident he can defy the sceptics and get the green light from the government. Although building Swansea Bay will require a high subsidy, Shorrock believes follow-on lagoon projects at Cardiff and Newport could shrink the power price to below \u00a3100 per MW/hour. \u201cAdd a single full-scale project to the pilot and the nation\u2019s first two tidal lagoons are, even in their early years, producing cheaper power than most other low-carbon generators in the country,\u201d he said. \u201cFor less than 1% of the UK\u2019s annual subsidy spend, the Swansea Bay tidal lagoon gives you a scalable blueprint for a secure, long-lived power supply that is low in cost and carbon. And you seed a new global industry here in the UK. That\u2019s incredible value.\u201d The ebullient 45-year-old claims to be 99.9% confident of getting the go-ahead on subsidies from the DECC before Christmas, hoping it would be too embarrassing at this stage to say no. But behind the public bravado, Shorrock is less sure. Friends of his told the Guardian that the green entrepreneur suffers bouts of fear that the government could yet \u201cpull the rug from under him\u201d. Shorrock, a former filmmaker, has plenty of other arguments as to why Swansea Bay makes sense \u2013 even for Tory ministers who are slashing subsidies on renewable energy. He stresses the potential for a massive UK supply chain, even though it is the British arm of a US-based firm, GE, that is overseeing the turbine manufacturing, and a Chinese company that will do the dredging and construct the sea wall. Sitting in a cafe overlooking Swansea docks, Shorrock said he wants Swansea Bay up and running in 2019-20, with larger schemes in Cardiff and Newport by 2022-23 and, if possible, more after that. He is already looking into plans to build storage schemes that would enable Swansea Bay power to be available for supply around the clock. Shorrock said huge institutional equity investors, such as Prudential, and those committed to buying some of the power, including Good Energy, would not attach their names to the project if it was a potty, no-hope scheme. The fast-talking Shorrock is a persuasive salesman with a track record in pulling off wind and solar schemes, but he has also made the odd blunder. A meeting meant to reassure Cornish householders over plans for his private company, Shire Oak, to reopen a quarry near the Lizard peninsula to provide rock for the Swansea Bay breakwater, only seemed to reinforce opposition. There has also been a complaint made to the government by a company about how the dredging and sea wall contract was handled, and concerns about the cosy relationship between Shorrock and Good Energy \u2013 Shorrock was until recently a paid adviser to Good Energy, which is run by his wife, Juliet Davenport. Despite all this, Shorrock seems to have almost single handedly built up huge momentum for Swansea Bay, not least by plugging the British innovation line. \u201cThe holy grail for everyone has always been a predictable renewable power,\u201d he said. \u201cEqually, it is time for us as an engineering and seafaring nation to show global leadership again. It\u2019s 100-odd years since Isambard Kingdom Brunel, but our time has come again.\u201d",

That is what the new university campus here provides and what a Swansea lagoon project would do,\u201d he argued.</p> <p>The project would take three years to build but have a design life of 120 years beyond that. Electricity would be generated by 320MW-capacity turbines propelled by the tide.</p> <p>The scheme is billed as a world first, but a similar \u2013 though different \u2013 tidal scheme has operated for 45 years at La Rance in north-western France. </p> <p>The Welsh secretary, Stephen Crabb, is unsurprisingly a fan but so is the prime minister, David Cameron, according to Mark Shorrock, chief executive of Tidal Lagoon Power, and the man at the centre of the scheme.</p> <p>Although the project was in the Conservative party manifesto, at a time when the government has been taking an axe to subsidies provided for solar and wind power, there are many who believe the Swansea Bay site will never be anything but a beach.</p> <p>Mandarins from the Department of Energy and Climate Change (DECC) and the Treasury are poring over the details before deciding whether it should be funded though a \u2018<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contract_for_difference\">contract for difference</a>\u2019 scheme.</p> <p>The cost of lagoon power \u2013 a predicted \u00a3168 per MW/hour \u2013 is considerably higher than for offshore wind, or the \u00a392.50 for nuclear.<br></p> <p>The project has already been dubbed potty and the Daily Mail has predicted it is in line for the chop \u2013 the newspaper\u2019s columnist, Christopher Booker, argued that Swansea would produce <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/debate/article-3041005/CHRISTOPHER-BOOKER-1-billion-lagoon-Britain-s-pottiest-green-scheme.html\">\u201ceasily the most expensive electricity in the world\u201d</a>.</p> <p>But Shorrock, who claims to have already spent \u00a326m, including \u00a37m of his own money, on the scheme, is confident he can defy the sceptics and get the green light from the government.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f1de3368f37803ea3edbe332c519f9989da5f54a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f1de3368f37803ea3edbe332c519f9989da5f54a/76_0_5249_3150/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Artist\u2019s impression of the sailing and boating centre\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">An artist\u2019s impression of the sailing and boating centre. </span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Although building Swansea Bay will require a high subsidy, Shorrock believes follow-on lagoon projects at Cardiff and Newport could shrink the power price to below \u00a3100 per MW/hour.</p> <p> \u201cAdd a single full-scale project to the pilot and the nation\u2019s first two tidal lagoons are, even in their early years, producing cheaper power than most other low-carbon generators in the country,\u201d he said.</p> <p> \u201cFor less than 1% of the UK\u2019s annual subsidy spend, the Swansea Bay tidal lagoon gives you a scalable blueprint for a secure, long-lived power supply that is low in cost and carbon.

Friends of his told the Guardian that the green entrepreneur suffers bouts of fear that the government could yet \u201cpull the rug from under him\u201d.</p> <p>Shorrock, a former filmmaker, has plenty of other arguments as to why Swansea Bay makes sense \u2013 even for Tory ministers who are slashing subsidies on renewable energy. </p> <p>He stresses the potential for a massive UK supply chain, even though it is the British arm of a US-based firm, GE, that is overseeing the turbine manufacturing, and a Chinese company that will do the dredging and construct the sea wall.</p> <p>Sitting in a cafe overlooking Swansea docks, Shorrock said he wants Swansea Bay up and running in 2019-20, with larger schemes in Cardiff and Newport by 2022-23 and, if possible, more after that. </p> <p>He is already looking into plans to build storage schemes that would enable Swansea Bay power to be available for supply around the clock. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f7df90e873685b3f6bbaae5b14e30383c4b96e2a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f7df90e873685b3f6bbaae5b14e30383c4b96e2a/0_0_3599_2160/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A visitor centre would also be built\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A visitor centre would also be built, including manufactured rock pools.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Juice Architects</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Shorrock said huge institutional equity investors, such as Prudential, and those committed to buying some of the power, including Good Energy, would not attach their names to the project if it was a potty, no-hope scheme.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/may/31/worlds-first-tidal-lagoon-clean-energy-scheme-environmental-concerns\">World's first tidal-lagoon clean energy scheme prompts environmental row</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The fast-talking Shorrock is a persuasive salesman with a track record in pulling off wind and solar schemes, but he has also made the odd blunder.

      "bodyText": "The recent turmoil in financial markets and the struggling Chinese economy could combine to hit global economic growth this year and force central banks to keep interest rates low, the International Monetary Fund has said ahead of a meeting of G20 finance ministers in Ankara this weekend. In a downbeat report that charted the increasing risk of a global slowdown, the IMF said finance ministers attending the conference in the Turkish capital needed to maintain government spending despite the still high public-sector debts left over from the 2008 banking crash. It said emerging economies reliant on the sale of oil and basic commodities would be especially vulnerable to a decline in trade with Beijing, which has soaked up much of the world\u2019s resources in the last decade. \u201cRisks are tilted to the downside, and a simultaneous realisation of some of these risks would imply a much weaker outlook,\u201d it said, reinforcing a warning from the IMF boss, Christine Lagarde, earlier this week. The report by the Washington-based lender of last resort came as stock markets rallied following steep falls across the world the previous day. In New York the Dow Jones was 100 points higher, while the FTSE-100 index of leading UK firms echoed continental exchanges to climb 0.4% to 6,083. The German Dax added 32 points, while the French CAC put on 14 points as both rose 0.3%. The Dow improved after industry figures showed US businesses added jobs at a steady pace last month, with most of the gains in the construction sector, which has boomed in response to a resurgence of housebuying. Manufacturing also showed solid gains, with few signs of factory closures or layoffs in response to falling exports to China. The payroll processor ADP said on Wednesday that businesses added 190,000 jobs last month, up from 177,000 in July, but below a six-month high in June of 231,000. Analysts said the figures suggested that turmoil in the financial markets and worries about faltering growth in China have not yet had much impact on the US job market. A solid performance for the UK construction sector had also boosted investor confidence. The CIPS/Markit survey of the industry showed the housebuilding sector expanding quickly alongside an improving demand for commercial building work. Earlier, the Shanghai market had tumbled to a 4% loss until the China Financial Futures Exchange said it would take further steps to curb excessive speculation in stock index futures trading. The European Central Bank meets on Thursday to consider a further loosening of its monetary policy to combat threats from China to the eurozone\u2019s steady recovery. The ECB president, Mario Draghi, is expected to say that the bank considered, but rejected, expanding its quantitative easing programme, which is currently pumping \u20ac85bn (\u00a362bn) into the banking system each month to support extra lending. Analysts said it was possible the ECB could step in later this year if declines in global trade continued to damage the prospects for the eurozone economy. Speaking ahead of his arrival at the G20 conference, Pierre Moscovici, the EU commissioner for economic affairs, said any threat to global growth posed by China\u2019s slowdown would be tackled by the eurozone international economic authorities. He said: \u201cI\u2019m reasonably optimistic and confident as far as the EU and eurozone is concerned. I think these economies are robust enough to resist some uncertainty which could come from other markets, knowing the authorities \u2013 monetary and political authorities in China and also the outside world \u2013 are ready to address those questions.\u201d Fears that higher interest rates in the US will send the dollar soaring, raising the costs to emerging economies of financing their massive dollar debts, have dogged financial markets all year. Figures showing a sharp slowdown in China\u2019s manufacturing output further spooked markets last month. The Federal Reserve was expected to make its first move to raise credit costs at its meeting later this month, hiking interest rates by 0.25 percentage points, but is now likely to delay the decision until later this year.",

The large number of unoccupied stores reflects the damage caused by the controversial administration, which led to the loss of 3,500 jobs. Nearly one in eight high street shops in Britain are empty, as town centres grapple with the growing popularity of online shopping and malls.

      "bodyText": "In Athens analysts are saying that the crisis-plagued country could be in for a nasty surprise - one that will further set back the Greek economy - when voters are called to cast ballots in the September 20 election. Our correspondent, Helena Smith reports from the capital: Another day, another poll, another sign that Greece\u2019s future remains as precarious as ever. Eighteen days before elections and the only thing that is certain is that there is no certainty. Investors, say analysts, have to be prepared for the unpredictable amid mounting evidence that the vote\u2019s outcome is likely to not only be surprising but inconclusive to boot. Opinion surveys revealed to date \u2013 and recent days have seen a barrage of them \u2013 have failed to \u201cbreak the silence\u201d of the vast majority of the electorate and therefore cannot be taken as read. \u201cThis silence in my view is extremely worrying and no one can really see if, and how, it will be expressed in the elections on 20 September,\u201d opined the political commentator Spyros Rizopoulos. \u201cThe elections may well hide surprises. But they will be unpleasant.\u201d The neo-fascist Golden Dawn could stand to benefit from a parliament that emerged more fractured than ever. With the former governing Syriza party\u2019s lead over the main opposition conservatives down to a mere one percent (according to a poll released by Alco today) the possibility of forming a viable government is being put increasingly to question. This afternoon Syriza\u2019s press spokeswoman (and former government spokeswoman) Olga Gerovasilli once again ruled out a coalition government being established with the conservatives, raising fears that a second round of elections may well be necessary to break the deadlock. That would be catastrophic for the economy and implementation of reforms required to unlock bailout funds in the months ahead. Underlying the disgruntlement in Syriza, the party\u2019s youth wing issued an excoriating letter berating the party\u2019s \u201cbankruptcy\u201d and announcing it would not be supporting it following Alexis Tsipras\u2019 spectacular embrace of creditor demands. Meanwhile another poll shows New Democracy pulling ahead: On that note, it\u2019s time to close up for now, so thanks for all your comments. Meanwhile former Greek prime minister Alexis Tsipras is continuing his campaigning via Twitter, and linking to his speech at the Syriza conference: Some positive news for Greece: Investors faced another volatile day on the markets, but after Tuesday\u2019s declines, at least Europe ended in positive territory. Shares were drifting for much of the day, but traders took heart from a recovery in China after authorities intervened to support the market and help it regain most of its losses earlier in the session. But later came a boost from - ironically - weaker than expected US jobs and factory data, which added to the idea that perhaps the Federal Reserve may not raise interest rates this month after all. (The Fed must surely also take into account the recent market turmoil caused by the devaluation of the Chinese currency and the growing fears over the outlook for global growth.) A higher than expected rise in US oil inventories took some of the shine off, sending crude prices lower again, but European markets managed to hold on to at least some of their gains. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished 24.77 points or 0.41% higher at 6083.31 Germany\u2019s Dax added 0.32% to 10,048.05 France\u2019s Cac closed up 0.3% at 4554.92 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB rose 0.75% to 21,612.00 Spain\u2019s Ibex was an exception, ending down 0.55% at 9938.3 The Athens market added 0.8% to 626.46 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently 111 points or 0.68% higher. On oil prices, IG market analyst Joshua Mahony said further falls looked likely: Crude oil prices tumbled as inventories rose for only the second time in six weeks. This comes at a time when Saudi Arabia continues to produce more than its OPEC quota, making it clear that the supply glut dominating the oil market is not over. With US driving season out the way, demand will certainly wane into the winter months, and with Iran bringing increasingly more crude to market, there is a good chance that oil prices could fall once more. As prices have tumbled in the face of rising stocks, this is being felt keenly by UK mining firms, which has helped pull the FTSE lower to erase many of today\u2019s early gains. Greece is set to miss its 2015 target for asset sales, in what would be a setback for the success of its new bailout deal, according to the head of the privatisation agency. As part of the terms of its \u20ac86bn rescue loan, Greece aims to raise \u20ac1.4bn from privatisations this year. But agency head Stergios Pitsioralas told Reuters in an interview that reaching the 2015 figure was \u201cunfeasible\u201d. The problem revolves around the deal for Germany\u2019s Fraport and energy firm Copelouzos to operate 14 regional airports. The plan has been agreed but Greece may not complete the transaction in time to receive the \u20ac1.2bn proceeds by December, Pitsiorlas said. But he added: On the other hand I think it is realistic that we achieve the 2016 targets. It aims to raise \u20ac3.7bn from asset sales next year and \u20ac1.3bn in 2017. The sales include stakes in its biggest ports, Piraeus and Thessaloniki although it wants to sell 51% initially of the latter, rather than the 67% first mooted, with an option on the remaining 16%. Oil prices, which had been moving higher, have gone into reverse after US crude stocks unexpectedly rose last week. Crude inventories climbed by nearly 4.7m barrels, according to the latest figures from the Energy Information Administration. This was the biggest one week rise since April, and compared with analysts\u2019 expectations of no change. After earlier moving as high at $50.79 a barrel, Brent crude slipped 0.63% to $49.25. Shares have also come off their best levels following the report. Over to Greece, and ratings agency Fitch says Greek depositors are unlikely to have to face a haircut as part of the bank recapitalisation. Fitch says: It is likely the relevant authorities will try to exercise available discretion within the Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive (BRRD) to avoid imposing losses on some creditors of Greek banks, particularly depositors... Discretion may be more limited from 2016, when the BRRD and the EC\u2019s Single Resolution Mechanism come fully into effect, so whatever treatment is applied to Greek banks may not establish a precedent for how BRRD will be applied in other countries. Greece voted in its BRRD legislation on 22 July. Under the \u20ac86bn bail-out agreement between Greece and its European creditors reached on 14 August, \u20ac25bn is earmarked for the banking sector to address recapitalisation and resolution costs. A \u20ac10bn tranche will be disbursed on Greece\u2019s request and confirmation of the amount by the Bank of Greece, the country\u2019s resolution authority. The balance is to be made available no later than 15 November, subject to completion of an Asset Quality Review and Stress Test (AQR) and implementation of steps to tackle impaired loans and address financial sector reform and governance. Few details about the AQR have been released but it seems likely that every effort will be made to complete it promptly. We previously estimated that \u20ac25bn would be sufficient in a \u201cCyprus style\u201d scenario, provided deferred tax assets of about \u20ac20bn remain recognised. Full report here: Fitch: Greek Banks to Test BRRD\u2019s Discretionary Powers Here\u2019s more on the dilemma facing the US Federal Reserve as it decides whether or not to raise interest rates this month. Writing before the latest ADP and factory orders data, Michael Hewson of CMC Markets said: While yesterday\u2019s ISM manufacturing number was disappointing, there is a concern that it may not have been disappointing enough to prevent a potential increase in the Fed Funds rate from its 0%-0.25% window. For what it\u2019s worth the prospect of a Fed rate rise still remains very much an outlier given the volatility seen in recent days, along with the consistent lack of inflationary pressure, not only in the global economy, but also the US economy, but given some of the current valuations in US equity markets, these remain the most vulnerable to a significant correction. What is apparent is that Fed policymakers have a wide range of views on what the next policy steps are likely to be and are being deliberately opaque, by trotting out the same lines about data dependence and taking the data on a case by case basis. Against that type of backdrop it is hard to see how they could arrive at the necessary consensus to push rates higher against such a volatile backdrop. This will of course put each US data release under much sharper focus, but we\u2019re now starting to see the results of the slowdown in the oil and gas sector start to trickle down into the headline numbers for US manufacturing, and this was borne out by yesterday\u2019s disappointing ISM report. Another piece of ammunition for those beginning to believe the US Federal Reserve may not hike interest rates this month after all. US factory orders in July came in lower than expected, up 0.4%. This was lower than the forecast 0.9% and well below the 2.2% gain recorded in July. Durable goods orders were revised up from an initial 2% to 2.2%. The rise on Wall Street has put some life into other markets, which are now showing some reasonable gains after a volatile day so far: After three days of decline, US shares have recovered some ground in early trading. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is up more than 200 points in the first few minutes, while the S&amp;P 500 is up more than 1%. On Tuesday the Dow closed down 469 points after the latest bad economic news from China prompted fears of a global slowdown, at the same time as the US Federal Reserve seemed set to raise interest rates at this month\u2019s meeting. But weaker US economic news - the latest being the ADP jobs survey - along with the China downturn has cast doubt on the Fed\u2019s timing. The ADP jobs survey may have perked up markets for the moment - on the basis perhaps that it was weaker than expected therefore the US Federal Reserve may not raise rates this month after all. But it gives little real guidance for Friday\u2019s non-farm payroll numbers, according to ING Bank\u2019s Rob Carnell. He said: With the ADP survey the only remotely accurate US non-farm payrolls directional indicator, the latest release might suggest that there is unlikely to be any significant deviation of Friday\u2019s payrolls from the 215,000 figure printed last month. The ADP employment total rose by 190,000, up from a downward revised 177,000 in July (previously 185,000). That said, a 13,000 monthly difference looks insignificant relative to the noise in this series, and a more reasonable description of the figures would be to say that there is no strong directional steer from the ADP this month. One interpretation of this would be that the August payrolls figures will be close to the 215,000 result in July. But that would be to ignore the scope for occasional but sizeable divergences in these two series. A better interpretation would be that anything is still possible from Friday\u2019s labour report figures, and scope for market surprises in both directions remains, though the probability of this coming from the payrolls figure looks smaller at this stage. There are, however, other parts of the report that might still inject some market volatility. The household employment survey in July was quite weak (+101,000), so we could be looking at some catch up in the region of +300,000 this month. So long as this isn\u2019t totally swallowed up in a surge in the labour force, which was also soft in July (+69,000), and with some helpful rounding, we might see more than a 0.1 percentage point fall in the unemployment rate, taking it down to 5.1% (consensus is for a fall from 5.3% to 5.2%). Finally, there is the hourly wages data. We have been looking in vain for a pick up here for longer than we care to remember, and anecdotes of rising wages seem to be failing to translate into higher official numbers. But the recent Conference Board labour data gave cause for some renewed optimism on the wages front, and if this is borne out, then there is just possibly some scope for wages to send a quite confusing message against the back of a non-descript payrolls number. After the roller coaster rides of recent days, the financial markets are slightly more sedate today, despite fresh losses in Asia overnight. Wall Street is expected to rally around 1% when trading begins in 30 minutes time, as traders recover their nerve after yesterday\u2019s 2.8% slide. Today\u2019s US jobs data may have calmed nerves in New York, even though it was a little weaker than expected. European market have turned positive too, after a day spent fluctuating between gains and losses after Tuesday\u2019s rout. Here\u2019s the situation in Europe heading into the Wall Street open: China\u2019s slowdown continues to loom over the world economy. IMF chief Christine Lagarde has expressed hope that Beijing achieves an \u2018orderly\u2019 transition to a mixed economy. Earlier, China\u2019s stock market fell by 0.2%, despite an attempt to prop up the market before tomorrow\u2019s military parade. One analysts fear fresh falls when the Shanghai stock market reopens, next Monday. Another City veteran explains how president President Xi Jinping is trying to get a tighter grip on the country\u2019s economic reforms. There\u2019s also plenty of worrying economic data to digest: Australia\u2019s growth rate has slowed to just 0.2% in the last quarter, one of the weakest performances yet. Brazilian industrial output took a dive last month. Eurozone producer prices have dipped, suggesting economic demand remains too weak for comfort. Financial markets may not be able to ignore Greece for long. The latest poll shows that Syriza\u2019s lead has been eroded away, leaving Alexis Tsipras\u2019s party just narrowly ahead of New Democracy. The election, on September 20, is looking too close to call: The winner of the election gets a 50-seat bonus (out of 300 MPs), but a tight result could mean another coalition government, complicating the implementation of the bailout deal and talks on debt relief. Here\u2019s some context for today\u2019s US jobs data, showing that firms are hiring fewer people than a year ago. American companies created slightly fewer jobs than expected in August, adding to the collection of disappointing data this week. Private payroll processor ADP reports that 190,000 new employees were hired in August, below the 200,000 that were inked by Wall Street. July\u2019s reading has also been revised down, from 185,000 to 177,000. That suggests that Friday\u2019s non-farm payroll, the main measure of US employment, could be weaker than expected, potentially giving another reason to leave interest rates unchanged. Here\u2019s another reason to fret about the global economy: Brazil\u2019s industrial output just shrank, and by much more than expected. Brazilian industrial output fell by 1.5% month-on-month in July, compared to forecasts of a 0.1% decline. Beijing could use the four-day closure of the stock market to devise new measures to calm the situation, argues Lukman Otunuga of FXTM. The Shanghai Composite Index will be closed on Thursday and Friday due to the World War II 70th anniversary commemorations, which will provide the market with some breathing space after receiving continual punishment over the past couple of weeks. The closure might be used as a period where policymakers in China get together and discuss policy measures that could be taken to stabilize the China markets. Wondering what\u2019s really going on in China, beyond the daily turmoil on the stock market? Then check out the latest blogpost from City veteran George Magnus, who\u2019s been tracking the country rather longer than most. China\u2019s economy: no collapse, but it\u2019s serious, and so are the politics He argues that China\u2019s economy is not collapsing -- yes, factory output has fallen, but there\u2019s still double-digit growth in retail sales and property. And Beijing isn\u2019t going to stop supporting the actual economy, even if it does let the Shanghai stock market find its own level (\u201cTimber!!!!!....\u201d). But we shouldn\u2019t be complacent. As we mentioned in yesterday\u2019s liveblog, China\u2019s service sector is slowing, putting the rebalancing at risk. That situation will worsen, Magnus predicts: As the second half of 2015 unfolds, we should expect the services sector to weaken, largely as the drag from the financial sector (following the stock market plunge) permeates the economy. This could take around 0.5% off GDP growth. The contraction in heavy industry, including metals, chemicals, cement, and power generation, may already have tipped some provinces in the north-east and west of China into a \u2018recession\u2019, defined as growth below 4-5%. Manufacturing investment will remain weak not least as a consequence of persistent excess capacity, deflation and debt in the industrial part of the economy. But the root cause of the slowdown, the market mayhem, and the devalued yuan, lies in China\u2019s political system, Magnus concludes. President Xi Jinping is trying to strengthen the Communist Party\u2019s grip on the economic levers, and drive through the reform agenda. There is little question that he and his senior colleagues understand they have to implement deep and meaningful economic reforms to unlock new sources of economic growth and productivity. The risk, as they know even better, is a loss of control. And they fear this more than anything. President Xi\u2019s anti-corruption campaign is weeding out high profile Party misfits, but simultaneously stifling growth and initiative. It is also making an example of so called \u2018tigers\u2019 \u2013 top Party officials \u2013 but it is impossible to go after all the \u2018flies\u2019 \u2013 lower level officials, whose misdemeanours (or worse) have a real effect on peoples\u2019 lives. Think only of the recent appalling chemicals explosion in Tianjn, where 11 local government and port officials have been accused of negligence and a beach of regulations, so far.... Here\u2019s the full piece: The International Monetary Fund is trying to help China reform its economy and avoid disorder, managing director Christine Lagarde told reporters in Jakarta today. Lagarde ended her two-day trip to Indonesia by emphasising the challenge facing Beijing, saying: \u201cWe are certainly talking to the Chinese authorities about their transition to a more market-determined economy, to an internationalization of their currency. It\u2019s a very significant transition, one that hopefully can be managed in an orderly fashion.\u201d Those discussions include the process of \u2018internationalising\u2019 the yuan, she added. (via Reuters) Yesterday, Lagarde warned that emerging economies should brace for a bumpy ride as China tries to rebalance its economy. Investors can take solace that the Chinese stock markets are now closed until next week, so Beijing can conduct its World War 2 victory parade. But what will happen next week, when the tanks, missiles and jets have been put away and the dignitaries have gone home? Angus Nicholson of IG says here\u2019s a \u201csense of foreboding\u201d for what the Monday session will bring. \u201cThe government has made it clear that it will not support the stock market anymore \u2013 the recent market intervention was focussed on removing the stock markets as an issue during the grand political spectacle planned for the WWII commemoration on Thursday. Once this event passes, there will be no short-term incentive to support the stock markets and we could see the SHCOMP testing its low of 2850 seen last week. This would be a further 10% decline in the index, and possibly even worse than \u2018Black Monday.\u201d Lower oil prices, and cheaper commodities, means eurozone producers received less for their wares in July. Producer prices dropped by 0.1% month-on-month in July, and were 2.1% lower than a year ago. That means that, while the eurozone escaped deflation this summer, there\u2019s little sign of price pressures building up. So, might the European Central Bank be forced into fresh stimulus measures soon? It\u2019s next monetary policy meeting is tomorrow, and economists reckon Mario Draghi may hint at further action. Economist Sean Richards explains: In many ways the ECB might have hoped for a summer lull to allow its QE program to grow and progress. If it had known the economic growth position alone then it might have been happy right now. However it has been in the past the keenest of the major central banks to hit its annual inflation target. I still recall the previous President Jean-Claude Trichet boasting about an average annual consumer inflation rate of 1.97%. In those terms the current one of 0.2% and no great expectations of much of a rise anytime soon is rather eloquent. The Saudi stock market has fallen over 2% in early trading, as it feels the knock-on impact of the 2% drop in the oil price today. Traders are calculating that there could be more of an oil glut than expected, given the weakness of the Chinese economy and yesterday\u2019s weaker factory data. Emerging markets are suffering from market volatility today. MSCI\u2019s emerging market index, which tracks shares across the region, has fallen by 0.4% today. That takes it close to its lowest level since 2009, having shed 2% yesterday. Russia is among the casualties, as Reuters reports: Russian assets took a knock from oil\u2019s sharp price reversal,with shares down half a percent and the rouble extending Tuesday\u2019s 3.8% fall, its biggest one-day loss in three months. The currency fell 0.9% to the dollar. China\u2019s slowdown is hurting emerging economies across the globe. They are also suffering capital outflows, as the \u2018hot money\u2019 which seeped into developing nations from major central banks continues to seep out again. Sebastien Barbe, head of emerging currency and debt strategy at Credit Agricole, sees more turbulence ahead, especially if the Federal Reserve hikes interest ratesL \u201cThe Chinese problems are not yet solved and the U.S. Fed rate hike is still in the pipe, so we don\u2019t expect any meaningful and sustainable rally in emerging markets in the short term.\u201d Wall Street may manage a small rally when trading begins in four hours time, having fallen by almost 3% yesterday. After that early attempt at a rally, Europe\u2019s stock markets are now falling back as a new dose of gloom sweeps trading floors. The FTSE 100 has fallen by 30 points to 6029, down almost 0.5%. And Germany\u2019s DAX has been dragged below the 10,000 point mark again too, down 0.3%, to 9986. The City is nervous after yesterday\u2019s 2.8% fall on Wall Street, which was triggered by economic concerns and confusion over when the US Federal Reserve might raise interest rates. Our old friend Glencore is the biggest faller in London yet again, down 5%, as the commodity trader takes the brunt of concerns over China\u2019s economy. Glencore shares are currently worth just 126p, bad news for anyone bought them at 530p when it floated four years ago. BP and Royal Dutch Shell are also leading the fallers, reflecting today\u2019s fall in the oil price. Growth across Britain\u2019s building firms picked up, a little, last month, according to a new healthcheck of the sector which bucks the gloomy trend today. The UK construction PMI rose to 57.3 in August, from 57.1 in July, driven by the fastest rise in commercial work since March. Companies reported a pick-up in workload, and new projects, meaning they also hired more staff. There are also signs that raw material shortages have eased, after recent brick shortages. Housebuilding remains the fastest-growing sector, while civil engineering growth slowed. Back in London, shares in two retailers have been hit this morning. Halfords tumbled almost 8% after reporting an 11% slide in bicycle sales in the last eight weeks, in an unscheduled trading statement. Asos, the online fashion retailer, fell 5% at the open after it confirmed that founder and CEO Nick Robertson is stepping down. Michael Hewson of CMC Markets also reckons that Chinese authorities stepped in to push the Shanghai market back up from its lows: While we have seen a late recovery in Asia, that\u2019s largely been as a result of some late state intervention in Chinese markets to help keep a floor under stocks, with the help of the Chinese equivalent of the plunge protection team. Beijing\u2019s preparation ahead of Thursday\u2019s military parade go beyond just propping up the stock market, incidentally. Officials have even been training monkeys to destroy birds nests, to avoid one being sucked into an engine as China\u2019s military jets fly over Tiananmen Square tomorrow. Sounds a bit extreme, but apparently it\u2019s cheaper and more efficient than using shotguns and water cannons. More here: Despite a valiant last-ditch attempt by Chinese officials, the Shanghai stock market has just closed down 0.2%. It had initially tumbled by over 4% at the start of the final session before a four-day break to mark the 70th anniversary of the end of the second world war. But then, we got one of the now-traditional afternoon rallies, as the institutions known as the \u2018National Team\u2019 bought shares to force the market up again. Angus Nicholson of IG explains: The \u2018National Team\u2019 has been busying itself in the stock markets, scaring off any bearish sentiment. The Shanghai Composite (SHCOMP) initially opened down 4.4%, but optimism over the coming two-day holiday and general patriotic sentiment seemed to spur the markets upward. Even that, though, wasn\u2019t enough to guarantee a rising stock market today, to set the mood for tomorrow\u2019s triumphant military parade. Beijing won\u2019t be happy. And that left most Asian markets in the red again: As predicted, European stock markets are pushing higher at the start of trading. The FTSE 100 is up 50 points, or 0.8%, a small recovery after Tuesday\u2019s 3% tumble. The other European equities indices are also a little higher. Investors are still anxious about the global economy, though, as Mike van Dulken of Accendo Markets reports: After US GDP was revised up last week and China data disappointed yesterday along with Canadian GDP, we had Aussie GDP miss overnight suggesting knock-on from China slowdown and commodities price declines. This adds to the muddy picture over global growth and thus monetary policy direction, notably on the other side of the pond. The oil price is coming under fresh pressure this morning too, in another sign that investors fear lower demand for energy. A barrel of US crude oil is now changing hands at $44.6, down almost 2%, adding to yesterday\u2019s losses. Having surged late last week, the rally in oil appears to be running out of steam. Markets have already received one piece of bad news today - Australia\u2019s economy has faltered. Australian GDP rose by just 0.2% in the three months to June, just half as much as economists had expected. That\u2019s down sharply on the 0.9% growth racked up in the January-March quarter, and is weaker than most of its international rivals: Not as bad as Canada, though, which fell into recession yesterday. But still not great. Although household and government spending rose, exports fell sharply. Having benefitted from China\u2019s economic boom, Australia is now feeling the pinch as demand for commodities such as iron ore falls. More here: Good morning. After Tuesday\u2019s chunky selloff, global stock markets remain jittery today as investors fret over the health of China\u2019s economy. A run of disappointing manufacturing date on Tuesday left markets on the back foot, with losses of 2.8% or worse in Tokyo, Shanghai, London, Frankfurt and New York. And Asian markets are down again today. Japan\u2019s Nikkei has lost another 0.39%, to close at 18,095 points. China\u2019s Shanghai index has been volatile too, currently down around 1% in afternoon trading - on the last day before a two-day holiday to celebrate Japan\u2019s defeat in World War II. European markets might scramble into the green when trading begins at 8am BST, but given recent volatility we can\u2019t guarantee they\u2019ll stay there for long. Yesterday\u2019s PMI reports showed that China\u2019s factory sector is shrinking at the fastest pace in three years, while Europe and the US were also weaker than expected. This has given the financial sector another reason to worry, as Ian Williams of Peel Hunt explains: The message from manufacturing PMI day across many of the world\u2019s key economies is that, despite the extended period of liquidity support, the sector is displaying less traction than hoped as demand falters in several regions. Those central bankers anxious to normalise policy were not expecting such news; nor were equity investors. Coming up..... On the agenda today, we have: 9.30am BST: UK construction PMI for August, showing how Britain\u2019s building industry fared last month. 10am BST: The eurozone producer price index for July, indicating whether inflationary pressures are picking up in Europe 1.15pm BST: The US ADP Employment report for August, which shows how many private sector jobs were created in America last month. 3pm: US factory orders for July, giving another insight into how America\u2019s manufacturing sector is faring. We\u2019ll be tracking all the action through the day.",

The ADP employment total rose by 190,000, up from a downward revised 177,000 in July (previously 185,000). That said, a 13,000 monthly difference looks insignificant relative to the noise in this series, and a more reasonable description of the figures would be to say that there is no strong directional steer from the ADP this month.</p> <p>One interpretation of this would be that the August payrolls figures will be close to the 215,000 result in July. But that would be to ignore the scope for occasional but sizeable divergences in these two series. A better interpretation would be that anything is still possible from Friday\u2019s labour report figures, and scope for market surprises in both directions remains, though the probability of this coming from the payrolls figure looks smaller at this stage.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b78ebb55bc33bcbeec586ffb1d9a91199128ce6c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b78ebb55bc33bcbeec586ffb1d9a91199128ce6c/0_0_4896_2939/1000.jpg\" alt=\"US private sector employment rises in August.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">US private sector employment rises in August.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jewel Samad/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <blockquote> <p>There are, however, other parts of the report that might still inject some market volatility. The household employment survey in July was quite weak (+101,000), so we could be looking at some catch up in the region of +300,000 this month. So long as this isn\u2019t totally swallowed up in a surge in the labour force, which was also soft in July (+69,000), and with some helpful rounding, we might see more than a 0.1 percentage point fall in the unemployment rate, taking it down to 5.1% (consensus is for a fall from 5.3% to 5.2%).<br></p> <p>Finally, there is the hourly wages data. We have been looking in vain for a pick up here for longer than we care to remember, and anecdotes of rising wages seem to be failing to translate into higher official numbers. But the recent Conference Board labour data gave cause for some renewed optimism on the wages front, and if this is borne out, then there is just possibly some scope for wages to send a quite confusing message against the back of a non-descript payrolls number.<br></p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2015-09-02T13:25:11.760Z\">at 2.25pm

This could take around 0.5% off GDP growth.

Officials tried to reassure businesses and the public after they learned they would lose the 2,000 megawatts from the Eggborough plant in North Yorkshire at a time when spare power capacity at peak times is set to reach zero. Eggborough\u2019s owners, Energetick\u00fd a Pr\u016fmyslov\u00fd Holding (EPH), had previously said it would close in six months\u2019 time. The company also said there would be 240 redundancies at the coal-burning facility, which provides 4% of the UK\u2019s electricity, or enough power for two million homes. \u201cThis is obviously disappointing news for everyone connected with Eggborough, but people can be assured that energy security will be unaffected,\u201d a DECC spokesman said. \u201cThe government takes security of supply very seriously and has worked with National Grid to put in place an effective plan which is flexible enough to adapt to individual plant closures,\u201d he said. EPH said it was forced to act because the 51-year-old plant would need \u00a3200m of additional funding to keep firing for another three years. It said its application for government subsidies to keep Eggborough open had been turned down. Neil O\u2019Hara, the plant\u2019s chief executive, said he was saddened at the prospect of generation coming to an end. \u201cEggborough Power could have a significant part to play in ensuring security of supply in the UK electricity market, particularly while there remains great uncertainty around new-build gas-fired generation. \u201cWe intend to conduct a thorough consultation process with our employees and their representatives while we continue to consider all options available to us, including seeking to engage with government bodies.\u201d In a separate move, the Treasury is being forced to defend the way it closed off parts of the climate change levy (CCL) in court. It gave the energy companies affected only 24 days\u2019 notice. Drax, the owner of another large, partly coal-fired power station in North Yorkshire, and the renewable power firm Infinis are seeking a judicial review of the CCL decision unveiled in George Osborne\u2019s July statement. Drax is generating a growing amount of energy by burning biomass pellets and estimates that the loss of CCL revenue will cut its core earnings by \u00a330m this year and \u00a360 million 12 months later. CCL is a tax on UK business energy use intended to reduce carbon emissions and promote energy from renewable sources. It was implemented in 2001 and is collected from businesses by energy suppliers through their bills. Customers were able to claim an exemption from the CCL if they bought electricity from certain renewable energy sources. Critics have accused the government of endangering the future of renewable power.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Tesco has agreed to increase the amount it pays farmers for milk used to produce cheese, in a major victory for the dairy industry in its battle with supermarkets. Britain\u2019s biggest retailer will pay farmers a price based on the cost of production in what farming leaders described as a significant move. Tesco already pays a price linked to the cost of production for milk itself, but it is the first major supermarket to extend the link to cheese. The move means it will pay 29.93p per litre for milk in cheese over the winter period, according to the National Farmers Union. The NFU has said dairy farmers face a \u201cstate of emergency\u201d after a 25% fall in the wholesale price of milk in the past year. The average farmgate price of milk stands at 23.35p a litre, below the estimated cost of production of 30p a litre. Farmers blame supermarkets for the slide in milk prices, saying it has been used as a weapon in the industry price war and that retailers are not doing enough to promote British-sourced products. In protest they have blockaded distribution centres and herded two cows through an Asda store in Stafford. Supermarkets say the fall is the result of an oversupply of milk in Europe, but they have bowed to pressure from farmers on a number of issues. Asda, Morrisons, Aldi and Lidl have increased the amount they pay, and Tesco has agreed to use only British milk in its own-brand yoghurts instead of importing from Germany, as it had done previously. Matt Simister, Tesco\u2019s commercial director for fresh food and commodities said the company was now increasing the amount it pays for milk in cheese because it \u201ccan understand how difficult the current market conditions are for farmers\u201d. He said: \u201cBy introducing a higher price, linked to our cost of production, customers can be confident that when they buy Tesco Standard Mild &amp; Medium cheddar, Tesco Value and Standard Red Leicester and Double Gloucester cheese, all our producers have benefited from a fair price for their milk. \u201cBritish farmers deliver some of the highest standards of milk quality in the world and some of the best conditions for animal welfare. \u201cIt is a naturally healthy and nutrient rich product we can all be very proud of. Across the UK, customers tell us that they want to buy milk products from cows which are looked after properly and they want the price that\u2019s paid to producers to be fair. \u201cIt\u2019s important to acknowledge that there isn\u2019t a single simple solution to resolve the uncertainty faced by many farmers, but a shared challenge for everyone in the supply chain to play their part, towards building a truly sustainable British dairy industry.\u201d Michael Oakes, the vice-chairman of the NFU\u2019s dairy board, said: \u201cWe are pleased that Tesco has recognised the challenging time the dairy industry is currently facing. This is especially welcome as we are heading towards the winter, as farmers face significantly higher costs of production while cows are housed. \u201cThis is the first retailer we have seen to make this move and this is a positive step given the current environment. Consumers have made it clear that they want to see a dairy sector that is sustainable in the long term and all retailers need to be accountable for this.\u201d",

The London-bound train was held close to the Channel tunnel for hours as police and a helicopter searched the roof, as well as under the train, with passengers sitting in darkness after power was switched off. With several other delayed trains having been returned to their destination, the Eurostar 9055 service, which left Paris at 19.13 on Tuesday, was then unable to return to the French capital due to a technical fault, and had to be towed back to the Calais-Fr\u00e9thun station.

      "bodyText": "\u201cWhat? I get $30,000 a year with no experience or skill?\u201d asks a billboard in New York\u2019s Times Square, the self-styled crossroads of the world. The poster, featuring a louche young man in sunglasses smiling smugly as he lifts one ear pad of his headphones off his baseball-capped head, is the work of a rightwing thinktank headed by Richard Berman, a man known to friends and enemies alike as \u201cDr Evil\u201d, a scourge of liberal politics, friend of indoor smokers and now a sworn enemy of the fight for a $15 minimum wage. The Employment Policy Institute bought the $100,000 ad in response to New York governor Andrew Cuomo\u2019s decision to pay the state\u2019s fast-food workers $15 an hour by 2018. \u201cWho needs an education or hard work when Gov Cuomo is raising the minimum wage to 15 dollars an hour?\u201d the billboard reads. Since the beginning of the Fight for $15 movement, there have been critics who have said that low-skilled, entry-level jobs such as those in retail and in the fast-food industry do not warrant a $15-an-hour wage. However, most public attacks have focused on the costs incurred by the businesses and the potential job losses that could be a consequence of a higher minimum wage. This latest one implies that higher wages could lead to more students dropping out of high school. \u201cThe billboard has two messages: 1) A $15 minimum wage is unfair to more-experienced employees who have already worked their way up to that wage; and 2) it has the potential to discourage people from seeking further education,\u201d Michael Saltsman, research direction of the Employment Policy Institute told the Guardian. He pointed to a 2003 study to support the institute\u2019s claims about enrollment rates. \u201cAt the $15 level, we\u2019d expect this risk to be magnified.\u201d The study referred to by Saltsman relies on data collected by the Current Population survey from 1970 to 1998. The Heritage Foundation, a conservative thinktank, also cited from this study in 2006, saying: In states which allow students to drop out of school before they are 18, a 10% increase in the minimum wage caused teenage school enrollment to drop by 2%. In states which require students to stay in school until they are 18, raising the minimum wage had no effect. In sum, when students have the option, higher minimum wages motivate some to leave school and start working. But if money were the only factor motivating these students to drop out, leaving school for a minimum-wage job \u2013 even if paid $15 an hour \u2013 would not be a smart investment. According to the New York Fed, those with a bachelor degree earn 56% more than high school graduates and are likely to earn about $1m more in their lifetime. Those with an associate degree earn 21% more than high school graduates and are likely to earn about $325,000 more in their lifetime. Guess who earns less than high school graduates? High school dropouts. Minimum-wage workers: not just teenagers Teenagers, however, represent only a fraction of workers who would benefit from a higher minimum wage, argue proponents of increasing the federally mandated minimum. \u201cThat ad simply displays employers\u2019 contempt for their low-wage workers, portraying them as young workers not needing to feed their families,\u201d Lawrence Mishel told the Guardian. Mishel is president of the other EPI \u2013 the left-leaning Economic Policy Institute. \u201cHow can that be accurate when more than 40% of America\u2019s workers earn less than $15 an hour? When the minimum wage is more than 25% below its 1968 value, almost 50 years ago and when the productivity was just half of what it is today?\u201d According to the Economic Policy Institute, if a federally mandated minimum wage were raised to $12 an hour as proposed by some Democratic lawmakers, the average age of an affected worker would be 36 years old. About 15.3% of affected workers would be aged 55 or older, compared with just 10.7% teenagers. The majority of workers \u2013 at 55.9% \u2013 would be women, including 40% of working single mothers. Additionally, about 45.1% of those who would be affected have at least some college experience. \u201cThis billboard just goes to show how out of touch the fast-food companies are with the people who work for them. We\u2019re not teenagers working at our first job \u2013 we\u2019re grown adults, with families to support,\u201d said Lawrence Williams, a Brooklyn Checkers worker in his mid-forties and father of two. \u201cMany of us have been working in fast food for years without ever seeing a raise above the minimum wage. The fact is the fast-food industry would rather spend their billions on billboards and ad campaigns than on paying their employees enough so we don\u2019t have to rely on food stamps to get by.\u201d \u201cThe billboard depicts an idea, not a specific person,\u201d Saltsman said, defending the ad. None of this controversy is likely to stop Berman\u2019s assault on Cuomo\u2019s plans. In addition to running EPI, Berman runs a public relations firm called Berman and Company and has also created the Center for Consumer Freedom. Berman has previously fought against bans on indoor smoking and the push to restrict calorie counts in fast foods. According to the New York Times, the EPI is a money-making venture for Berman, since the institute employs Berman and Company to make most of its ads. And what does Berman have to say about being called Dr Evil? \u201cIt is a term of endearment given to him by a friend,\u201d said Saltsman. \u201cCritics have co-opted it for their own purposes.\u201d",

This latest one implies that higher wages could lead to more students dropping out of high school.</p> <p>\u201cThe billboard has two messages: 1) A $15 minimum wage is unfair to more-experienced employees who have already worked their way up to that wage; and 2) it has the potential to discourage people from seeking further education,\u201d Michael Saltsman, research direction of the Employment Policy Institute told the Guardian. He pointed to <a href=\"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0272775702000067\">a 2003 study</a> to support the institute\u2019s claims about enrollment rates. \u201cAt the $15 level, we\u2019d expect this risk to be magnified.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/jul/22/new-york-fast-food-workers-15-an-hour\">New York state fast food workers celebrate $15 minimum wage victory</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The study referred to by Saltsman relies on data collected by the Current Population survey from 1970 to 1998. The <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.heritage.org/research/reports/2006/07/raising-the-minimum-wage-hurts-vulnerable-workers-job-prospects-without-reducing-poverty\">Heritage Foundation</a>, a conservative thinktank, also cited from this study in 2006, saying:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>In states which allow students to drop out of school before they are 18, a 10% increase in the minimum wage caused teenage school enrollment to drop by 2%. In states which require students to stay in school until they are 18, raising the minimum wage had no effect. In sum, when students have the option, higher minimum wages motivate some to leave school and start working.</p> </blockquote> <p>But if money were the only factor motivating these students to drop out, leaving school for a minimum-wage job \u2013 even if paid $15 an hour \u2013 would not be a smart investment.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/2014/jun/24/college-education-worth-it-jobs-debt-work\">According to the New York Fed</a>, those with a bachelor degree earn 56% more than high school graduates and are likely to earn about $1m more in their lifetime. Those with an associate degree earn 21% more than high school graduates and are likely to earn about $325,000 more in their lifetime.</p> <p>Guess who earns less than high school graduates? High school dropouts.</p> <h2>Minimum-wage workers: not just teenagers</h2> <p>Teenagers, however, represent only a fraction of workers who would benefit from a higher minimum wage, argue proponents of increasing the federally mandated minimum.</p> <p>\u201cThat ad simply displays employers\u2019 contempt for their low-wage workers, portraying them as young workers not needing to feed their families,\u201d Lawrence Mishel told the Guardian. Mishel is president of the other EPI \u2013 the left-leaning Economic Policy Institute.</p> <p>\u201cHow can that be accurate when more than 40% of America\u2019s workers earn less than $15 an hour? When the minimum wage is more than 25% below its 1968 value, almost 50 years ago and when the productivity was just half of what it is today?\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.epi.org/publication/raising-the-minimum-wage-to-12-by-2020-would-lift-wages-for-35-million-american-workers/\">According to the Economic Policy Institute</a>, if a federally mandated minimum wage were raised to $12 an hour as proposed by some Democratic lawmakers, the average age of an affected worker would be 36 years old. About 15.3% of affected workers would be aged 55 or older, compared with just 10.7% teenagers. The majority of workers \u2013 at 55.9% \u2013 would be women, including 40% of working single mothers.</p> <p>Additionally, about 45.1% of those who would be affected have at least some college experience.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/MarkLevineNYC/statuses/638127094065680385\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Times Sq billboard makes makes no sense.

We\u2019re not teenagers working at our first job \u2013 we\u2019re grown adults, with families to support,\u201d said Lawrence Williams, a Brooklyn Checkers worker in his mid-forties and father of two.</p> <p>\u201cMany of us have been working in fast food for years without ever seeing a raise above the minimum wage. The fact is the fast-food industry would rather spend their billions on billboards and ad campaigns than on paying their employees enough so we don\u2019t have to rely on food stamps to get by.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe billboard depicts an idea, not a specific person,\u201d Saltsman said, defending the ad.</p> <p>None of this controversy is likely to stop Berman\u2019s assault on Cuomo\u2019s plans. In addition to running EPI, Berman runs a public relations firm called Berman and Company and has also created the Center for Consumer Freedom. Berman has previously fought against bans on indoor smoking and the push to restrict calorie counts in fast foods. <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/10/us/politics/fight-over-minimum-wage-illustrates-web-of-industry-ties.html?_r=0\">According to the New York Times</a>, the EPI is a money-making venture for Berman, since the institute employs Berman and Company to make most of its ads.</p> <p><span tabindex=\"-1\">And what does Berman have to say about being called Dr</span><span tabindex=\"-1\"> Evil?</span></p> <p>\u201cIt is a term of endearment given to him by a friend,\u201d said Saltsman. \u201cCritics have co-opted it for their own purposes.\u201d</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p><br></p> <p></p> <p></p>",

There were a few bright spots in the falling FTSE 100 (unlike on Tuesday when only engineer Meggitt managed to make any gains as global markets including Wall Street tumbled). Equipment hire group Ashtead has added 45p to 962p after it reported a 20% rise in first quarter revenue to \u00a3539.6m and said it was on track to reach its full year target. In a buy note, Investec said: Despite concerns over comments from its main peer and wider concerns on the US macro outlook, this was another strong quarter of growth ahead of its end markets. In the US, Sunbelt delivered 23% rental only revenue growth, with A-Plant in the UK seeing a 10% rise. The group continues to take market share, its end markets are still in recovery mode and importantly, structural growth is still prevalent. On this basis and given the current rating at a 2016 estimated PE of 11.7 times and sub-6 times enterprise value/EBITDA, we reiterate our positive stance. Hikma was 99p higher at \u00a323.24 after a positive note from Barclays in the wake of the pharmaceutical group\u2019s $2.65bn purchase of the generics drug division of US business Boehringer Ingleheim. The bank said: At a point when the market was fixated on [key product] colchicine, and unfounded claims that growth was over-reliant on shortage situations, Hikma has transformed its US exposure and long-term visibility through the $2.65bn acquisition of Roxane. Boosting outer year earnings by more than 20%, the deal revolutionises future opportunities... It marks the second transaction between Hikma and Boehringer so begs the question what is next, and with a major influx of R&amp;D personnel the long term growth profile is significantly de-risked. We raise our price target to \u00a327.60 [from \u00a320.50] on the relatively de-risked investment case. With Boehringer owning around 17% of Hikma [it] could benefit from further expansion of the relationship via: i) becoming Boehringer\u2019s future authorized generic partner, ii) distributing Boehringer products in the Middle East and North Africa, and iii) potential future biosimilar collaboration. Meanwhile chip designer Arm is up 16.5p to 930p as JP Morgan Cazenove moved from underweight to neutral. Tesco has edged up 0.05p to 185.45p on reports it has picked private equity firm MBK Partners as the preferred bidder for its South Korean business. But overall the FTSE 100 is faltering again, down 16.10 points at 6042.44, ahead of US jobs data later which could give further clues as to the timing of a Federal Reserve rate rise. More significantly, Friday sees the US non-farm payroll numbers, which have the potential to cause more volatility. Meanwhile Chinese markets are closed until Monday due to celebrations to mark Japan\u2019s defeat in World War II. Commodity companies were under pressure again as the fears of a slowdown in China hit metal and oil prices. Brent crude is currently down another 1.69% at $48.72. Royal Dutch Shell B shares are down 30p at \u00a316.16 while BP is 4.8p lower at 344.6p. Among the miners Glencore continues to decline, down another 6.55p at 126.95p on financing concerns. Asia focused HSBC is down 6.55p at 492.45p and Standard Chartered is 10p lower at 714.2p on contining concerns about emerging markets. Lower down the market Halfords has lost 41p to 469p after weaker bicycle sales, although it said it was still on course to meet profit forecasts. Peel Hunt said: While the performance of Halfords\u2019 cycling division was undoubtedly disappointing in the second quarter, the fundamentals of the investment case have not changed. Cycling remains a growth market in the medium and long term, and crucially, cash generation is extremely strong here. The company will be cash- positive by 2018 and a material cash distribution is possible in the next few years. While today\u2019s news is unfortunate, we would use the weakness as a buying opportunity.",

      "bodyText": "Halfords has blamed a sharp fall in its sales of bicycles and cycling equipment over the summer on bad weather that deterred casual cyclists from taking to the road or upgrading their kit. In an unscheduled trading statement, Halfords said cycling revenues at stores open for a year or more fell 11% in the eight weeks to 28 August. The company, which is under new leadership, said discounting in the market was also a factor. The news sent Halfords\u2019 shares down by almost 10% to 459p on concerns that the retailer\u2019s success, powered by the recent wave of enthusiasm for cycling, could be faltering. The statement marked a contrast to Halfords\u2019 last trading statement in mid-July, which showed cycling sales growth had slowed to 2% in the three months to 3 July but gave no hint that sales would fall. Jill McDonald, who took over as Halfords\u2019 chief executive in May, said the falling sales had taken the company by surprise, but that there was plenty more mileage for Halfords from the cycling bug in the long run. \u201cWe issued this trading update because cycling has been a little bit weaker than expected. We are seeing cycling as a blip. Overall, poor weather over the summer has been wetter and colder than usual and it has been intermittent. We haven\u2019t had long stretches of warm weather and that has deterred the casual cyclist.\u201d Halfords\u2019 annual sales broke \u00a31bn for the first time last year, with cycling its best-performing division. The company has capitalised on bike fever in the UK, fuelled by the sporting success of cyclists such as Bradley Wiggins and Chris Boardman, whose endorsed bikes Halfords stocks, the Tour de France and the 2012 Olympics. The craze has led to a boom in sales of expensive bikes to well-off aging men, known as Mamils \u2013 middle-aged men in lycra. McDonald joined Halfords from McDonald\u2019s, where she led the fast food chain\u2019s operations in the UK and seven other countries. Her predecessor, the cycling enthusiast Matt Davies, left to run Tesco\u2019s UK operation. She said Halfords had sold more high-end bikes in the past two months than a year earlier, but that prices had come under pressure from reductions made by competitors. The company plans to revamp its children\u2019s range and introduce new offers to tap into the long-term growth in sales. Growing participation, particularly by women, government investment in cycle lanes and other infrastructure and rising consumer spending would all underpin the market, McDonald said. \u201cLook outside and see what\u2019s happening. The number of cyclists on the road is visible. We have got plenty of reasons to be optimistic about the future.\u201d Tandem Group, whose cycle brands include Dawes and Claud Butler, said a year ago that the market for cheaper leisure bikes was highly competitive with Halfords, JD Williams and supermarkets reducing prices. Halfords said its other businesses, including car maintenance and parts, had performed as expected or better. Annual profit before tax would be broadly in line with market expectations, thanks to cost cuts and better-than-forecast profit margins. Analysts at the stockbroker Stifel said: \u201cCycling sales are much weaker than expected. The company is guiding to unchanged consensus on the back of this sales weakness, which seems a little optimistic with Christmas to look forward to. This is an unexpected challenge for Jill McDonald.\u201d McDonald said her first few months had not felt like a baptism of fire. \u201cNo, it\u2019s exciting. I\u2019m as excited about automotive as I am about the cycling side. I\u2019m enjoying it,\u201d she said.",

      "bodyText": "If the next federal election is fought on economic management and economic outcomes, Labor will romp in. The economy remains moribund, with each hopeful snippet of good news quickly shot down by a flood of mediocre or downright bad news. Consumers, and that means voters, are starting to suffer financial hardship which is one reason the Coalition should find any issue other than economic management to fight the upcoming election on. Making the issue of economic management even more parlous for the Abbott government is its abject failure to deliver on its pledges and promises prior to the September 2013 election. Those included return to budget surplus, cutting government debt and having a pro-business strategy in its economic policy management. Indeed, on election night in 2013, prime minister elect Tony Abbott declared Australia \u201copen for business\u201d. Abbott has reiterated this mantra since that time with his \u201ceconomic growth and jobs\u201d theme. Even last week, Abbott said, without a hint of embarrassment, that his government \u201cwill fight for jobs, we will fight for investment and we will fight for growth\u201d. The inference from this powerful rhetoric is that under the Abbott government and its policies, the business sector would be strong and the economy robust. This stronger economy, it was implied, would lead to lower unemployment and prosperity would be unleashed as the economy was unshackled. Two years on from the election and the runs on the board for the Abbott government are scarce. In fact a scorecard of key economic indicators are quite disturbing for a government that was seemingly hellbent on super-charging the private sector of the economy. Here is a run of some economic news since the election. The starting point for comparisons is the September quarter 2013 for quarterly data and September 2013 for monthly data. Since the election, private sector capital expenditure has fallen by a quite stunning 15%. This means that businesses have savagely cut their investment plans and undermined the growth momentum of the economy. The so-called investment expectations data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics suggests that business investment will fall by a further 20% in 2015-16. These are business investment outcomes usually seen during recessions. At the same time, the national accounts revealed real GDP growth slowed to a paltry 2.0% in the year to the June quarter 2015. Growth is, at best tepid, at worst we are seeing a stagnation that is undermining incomes and living standards. Annual GDP growth has been below 3% for the term of the Abbott government and if anything, growth is slowing with quarterly GDP up just 0.2% in the June quarter. According to ABS data, company profits have fallen a sharp 6% since the election. This is despite the positive cash-flow effects of record low interest rates and the competitive boost from the lower Australian dollar which today slid below 70 US cents. Simply put, firms are struggling to maintain profits whilst the economy is weak, even though there are positive factors helping their bottom line. What is also apparent is that the business sector has responded to these economic conditions by under-hiring workers and cracking down on pay rates. The unemployment rate has jumped to a 13-year high of 6.3% and annual growth in wages, as measured by average weekly earnings, has slumped to 1.2% which is the lowest pace of wages growth in many decades. Wages growth is accordingly less than the rate of inflation, meaning that the purchasing power for the average household is falling. These labour market dynamics mean that the number of people unemployed has risen by 114,000 to more than 800,000, a 21-year high. Amid these poor economic indicators, the government has increased the budget deficit by about $25bn a year from the level presented to it in the pre-election fiscal outlook in August 2013. A mix of additional spending, giving up the revenue from the carbon price, the bank levy and mining tax and weaker growth have all conspired to see the budget deficit increase. Gone is any discussion of a surplus until at least the 2020s and gross government debt has risen to a record $384bn, over $110bn higher than the level inherited by the Abbott government. Government debt will soon exceed $400bn, given treasurer Joe Hockey\u2019s inability to get government spending and the budget deficit under control. Perhaps the most telling fact that smashes once and for all the economic management myth that surrounds the Coalition government is the weakness of the Australian stock market. The recent market volatility has not hidden the fact that since election, the ASX200 is down about 4% (using Wednesday\u2019s level of about 5,050 points). This lame performance sits in stark contrast with other major global stock markets. Over the same time, the US S&amp;P 500 and German DAX indices are both up by more than 15%, the Japanese Nikkei is up by about 25% while the UK FTSE has been weaker, dropping by about 5%. The weak economy has clearly weighed on profits and therefore share prices. There is no doubt that the economy has not responded at all well to the election of the Abbott government. Growth is sluggish, the unemployment rate is rising and the business investment and profits are in the doldrums. This is not a set of economic conditions that would normally favour an incumbent government. With just a year until the election, there needs to be a sudden and dramatic turn in conditions if the Abbott government is to go to the polls using the economy to build its case for re-election.

Gone is any discussion of a surplus until at least the 2020s and gross government debt has risen to a record $384bn, over $110bn higher than the level inherited by the Abbott government. Government debt will soon exceed $400bn, given <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/joe-hockey\">treasurer Joe Hockey\u2019s</a> inability to get government spending and the budget deficit under control.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/feb/20/unemployment-rate-of-64-means-its-time-to-spend-money-to-create-jobs\">Unemployment rate of 6.4% means it's time to spend money to create jobs | Stephen Koukoulas</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Perhaps the most telling fact that smashes once and for all the economic management myth that surrounds the Coalition government is the weakness of the Australian stock market.</p> <p>The recent market volatility has not hidden the fact that since election, the ASX200 is down about 4% (using Wednesday\u2019s level of about 5,050 points). This lame performance sits in stark contrast with other major global stock markets. Over the same time, the US S&amp;P 500 and German DAX indices are both up by more than 15%, the Japanese Nikkei is up by about 25% while the UK FTSE has been weaker, dropping by about 5%.</p> <p>The weak economy has clearly weighed on profits and therefore share prices.</p> <p>There is no doubt that the economy has not responded at all well to the election of the Abbott government. Growth is sluggish, the unemployment rate is rising and the business investment and profits are in the doldrums. This is not a set of economic conditions that would normally favour an incumbent government. With just a year until the election, there needs to be a sudden and dramatic turn in conditions if the Abbott government is to go to the polls using the economy to build its case for re-election. </p> <p><em>Stephen Koukoulas is a research fellow at Per Capita, a progressive thinktank</em></p>",
