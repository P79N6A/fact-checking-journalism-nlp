    "webTitle": "UK's loss of AAA rating starting to look inevitable", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Britain will be downgraded if the budget deficit rises because of weak growth. And it will be downgraded if the government shows any sign of backsliding on its commitment to austerity. The message for George Osborne from the rating agency S&amp;P was that he is damned if he does and damned if he doesn't. Any temptation to feel sorry for the chancellor in these trying circumstances should be resisted. It was Osborne who turned the UK's AAA credit rating into a virility symbol in his early days at the Treasury when he was out to show what a tough guy he was. Now, unless something entirely unexpected happens in the next few months, he faces the very real threat that the people he has courted so assiduously will humiliate him with a debt downgrade. Make no mistake, the chances of this happening are higher than the one in three quoted by S&amp;P when they put Britain on negative watch. The economy has moved sideways for two years, weak growth has meant the deficit has not come down as quickly as expected, the end of austerity has been pushed back deep into the next parliament, and Osborne will miss one of the targets he set himself \u2013 to have debt as a share of national income falling by 2015-16. It is hardly surprising that the warning bells are ringing at S&amp;P and that they have now fallen into line with their rival credit rating agencies: Moody's and Fitch. The chancellor will only be spared the embarrassment of a downgrade if the economy starts to show signs of a decent recovery in 2013. For this to happen, the euro crisis would need to be resolved, inflation would need to come down so that real incomes can rise, the Bank of England's Funding for Lending Scheme would need to get credit flowing to the parts of the economy that need it, businesses would have to start investing.

And it will be downgraded if the government shows any sign of backsliding on its commitment to austerity. The <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2012/dec/13/uk-credit-rating-warning-s-and-p-downgrade\" title=\"\">message for George Osborne from the rating agency S&amp;P</a> was that he is damned if he does and damned if he doesn't.</p> <p>Any temptation to feel sorry for the chancellor in these trying circumstances should be resisted. It was Osborne who turned the UK's AAA credit rating into a virility symbol in his early days at the Treasury when he was out to show what a tough guy he was. Now, unless something entirely unexpected happens in the next few months, he faces the very real threat that the people he has courted so assiduously will humiliate him with a debt downgrade.</p> <p>Make no mistake, the chances of this happening are higher than the one in three quoted by S&amp;P when they put Britain on negative watch. The economy has moved sideways for two years, weak growth has meant the deficit has not come down as quickly as expected, the end of austerity has been pushed back deep into the next parliament, and Osborne will miss one of the targets he set himself \u2013 to have debt as a share of national income falling by 2015-16. It is hardly surprising that the warning bells are ringing at S&amp;P and that they have now fallen into line with their rival credit rating agencies: Moody's and Fitch.</p> <p>The chancellor will only be spared the embarrassment of a downgrade if the economy starts to show signs of a decent recovery in 2013. For this to happen, the euro crisis would need to be resolved, inflation would need to come down so that real incomes can rise, the Bank of England's Funding for Lending Scheme would need to get credit flowing to the parts of the economy that need it, businesses would have to start investing. Few expect this to happen, and the likeliest outcome is for another year of weak growth that will prompt at least one, and probably all three, of the rating agencies into a move.</p> <p>At the moment, Osborne is in the comfortable position of knowing there are ready buyers for UK debt, with an auction of 12-year index-linked gilts so popular that investors were prepared to pay for the privilege of being allowed to lend the government money.

    "webTitle": "UK credit rating threatened with S&P downgrade", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "George Osborne's economic credibility suffered a fresh blow on Thursday when Standard and Poor's became the third of the major credit ratings agency to put the UK's AAA rating on negative outlook. In a statement issued just after the London markets closed, S&amp;P warned there was a one-in-three chance that it would strip the UK of its cherished AAA status within the next two years. \"We believe this could occur in particular as a result of a delayed and uneven economic recovery, or a weakening of political commitment to consolidation,\" it said. S&amp;P did not call for the government to abandon its austerity plans, but it warned that the deficit-cutting strategy will continue to undermine growth. \"We continue to believe that government's efforts over the next few years to engineer the planned correction in the UK's fiscal accounts will likely drag on economic growth.\" It added that belt-tightening by debt-burdened consumers and weak investment by anxious firms were likely to continue to depress demand. Ministers, including chief secretary to the Treasury Danny Alexander, have played down the significance of a ratings cut in recent days; but the chancellor has pinned his political reputation on maintaining Britain's reputation as a \"safe haven\" for foreign investors. S&amp;P's announcement came after Osborne was forced to announce in last week's autumn statement that economic growth has been far weaker than he hoped even in his March budget; and he now expects to flunk his self-imposed rule of cutting the public debt burden by 2015-16. S&amp;P said its own calculations suggested the debt-to-GDP ratio, forecast by the independent Office for Budget Responsibility to peak just below 80% of GDP, could actually hit 100% of GDP - on its own definition - if the economic recovery continues to disappoint. Its decision followed similar moves from the two other major ratings agencies, Fitch and Moody's, and will ratchet up the pressure on the government over its handling of the economy. A Treasury spokeswoman said, \"it is a hard road, but the economy is on the right track.\" She added, \"in their assessment, Standard &amp; Poor's endorse the government's 'strong commitment to implementing the fiscal mandate' and specifically warn against slowing 'the pace and extent of fiscal consolidation'.\" Government insiders have also been buoyed by the fact that both the US and France have lost their AAA ratings in the past two years, without seeing their borrowing costs rocket. David Tinsley, of investment bank BNP Paribas, said, \"2013 looks like being a year when the UK could lose its AAA rating fairly comprehensively...we would be surprised if the UK got through next year without at least one downgrade, and quite possibly two or three.\" He added: \"the Bank of England will continue to stand as a 'buyer of last resort' of gilts if the economy worsens. Nonetheless, some of the safe-haven glow of the UK is looking a bit tarnished.\" S&amp;P's intervention came after the chancellor defended his autumn statement before the cross-party treasury select committee of MPs. Osborne hinted that he might consider rewriting the Bank of England's job description, forcing it to focus on kick-starting growth, after the idea was mooted by governor-to-be Mark Carney. The chancellor acknowledged that there was a \"debate going on,\" about the best way for monetary policy to support recovery. Carney, currently governor of the Bank of Canada, has floated the idea that central banks could aim at boosting nominal GDP - economic output plus inflation - instead of tracking an inflation target, the framework followed in the UK since the early-1990s. Proponents of a nominal GDP target argue that it would increase the pressure on policymakers to take aggressive action to re-start growth, instead of fretting about unleashing inflation. The chancellor said he currently had, \"no plans,\" to change the Bank's remit; but commented that there is \"innovative stuff happening around the world.\" \"There is a debate going on. I'm glad the future Bank of England governor is part of that debate\". It was announced on Thursday that Carney, who will take over from Sir Mervyn King next summer, will himself appear before the select committee on 7 February next year. He is expected to be questioned about whether the Bank's remit should be shifted to reflect the lessons of the economic crisis. Osborne told MPs: \"It's totally to be expected after everything that has happened to the international economy, and indeed to the British economy over the last four or five years, that there is a debate about the future of monetary policy.\" However, he stressed that there would need to be a \"pretty strong case\" for any change. One of the nine members of the Bank's monetary policy committee echoed that cautious note yesterday. Paul Fisher, executive director of markets at Threadneedle Street, said the \"real debate\" was not about the technicalities of specific targets, but, \"what should policy be doing in the current environment.\"",

      "body": "<p>George Osborne's economic credibility suffered a fresh blow on Thursday when Standard and Poor's became the third of the major credit ratings agency to put the UK's AAA rating on negative outlook.</p> <p>In a statement issued just after the London markets closed, S&amp;P warned there was a one-in-three chance that it would strip the UK of its cherished AAA status within the next two years.</p> <p>\"We believe this could occur in particular as a result of a delayed and uneven economic recovery, or a weakening of political commitment to consolidation,\" it said.</p> <p>S&amp;P did not call for the government to abandon its austerity plans, but it warned that the deficit-cutting strategy will continue to undermine growth.</p> <p>\"We continue to believe that government's efforts over the next few years to engineer the planned correction in the UK's fiscal accounts will likely drag on economic growth.\"</p> <p>It added that belt-tightening by debt-burdened consumers and weak investment by anxious firms were likely to continue to depress demand.</p> <p>Ministers, including chief secretary to the Treasury Danny Alexander, have played down the significance of a ratings cut in recent days; but the chancellor has pinned his political reputation on maintaining Britain's reputation as a \"safe haven\" for foreign investors.</p> <p>S&amp;P's announcement came after Osborne was forced to announce in last week's autumn statement that economic growth has been far weaker than he hoped even in his March budget; and he now expects to flunk his self-imposed rule of cutting the public debt burden by 2015-16.</p> <p>S&amp;P said its own calculations suggested the debt-to-GDP ratio, forecast by the independent Office for Budget Responsibility to peak just below 80% of GDP, could actually hit 100% of GDP - on its own definition - if the economic recovery continues to disappoint.</p> <p>Its decision followed similar moves from the two other major ratings agencies, Fitch and Moody's, and will ratchet up the pressure on the government over its handling of the economy.</p> <p>A Treasury spokeswoman said, \"it is a hard road, but the economy is on the right track.\" She added, \"in their assessment, Standard &amp; Poor's endorse the government's 'strong commitment to implementing the fiscal mandate' and specifically warn against slowing 'the pace and extent of fiscal consolidation'.\"</p> <p>Government insiders have also been buoyed by the fact that both the US and France have lost their AAA ratings in the past two years, without seeing their borrowing costs rocket.</p> <p>David Tinsley, of investment bank BNP Paribas, said, \"2013 looks like being a year when the UK could lose its AAA rating fairly comprehensively...we would be surprised if the UK got through next year without at least one downgrade, and quite possibly two or three.\"</p> <p>He added: \"the Bank of England will continue to stand as a 'buyer of last resort' of gilts if the economy worsens. Nonetheless, some of the safe-haven glow of the UK is looking a bit tarnished.\"</p> <p>S&amp;P's intervention came after the chancellor defended his autumn statement before the cross-party treasury select committee of MPs.</p> <p>Osborne hinted that he might consider rewriting the Bank of England's job description, forcing it to focus on kick-starting growth, after the idea was mooted by governor-to-be Mark Carney.</p> <p>The chancellor acknowledged that there was a \"debate going on,\" about the best way for monetary policy to support recovery.</p> <p>Carney, currently governor of the Bank of Canada, has floated the idea that central banks could aim at boosting nominal GDP - economic output plus inflation - instead of tracking an inflation target, the framework followed in the UK since the early-1990s.</p> <p>Proponents of a nominal GDP target argue that it would increase the pressure on policymakers to take aggressive action to re-start growth, instead of fretting about unleashing inflation.</p> <p>The chancellor said he currently had, \"no plans,\" to change the Bank's remit; but commented that there is \"innovative stuff happening around the world.\"</p> <p>\"There is a debate going on. I'm glad the future Bank of England governor is part of that debate\".</p> <p>It was announced on Thursday that Carney, who will take over from Sir Mervyn King next summer, will himself appear before the select committee on 7 February next year. He is expected to be questioned about whether the Bank's remit should be shifted to reflect the lessons of the economic crisis.</p> <p>Osborne told MPs: \"It's totally to be expected after everything that has happened to the international economy, and indeed to the British economy over the last four or five years, that there is a debate about the future of monetary policy.\" However, he stressed that there would need to be a \"pretty strong case\" for any change.</p> <p>One of the nine members of the Bank's monetary policy committee echoed that cautious note yesterday. Paul Fisher, executive director of markets at Threadneedle Street, said the \"real debate\" was not about the technicalities of specific targets, but, \"what should policy be doing in the current environment.\"</p>",

      "bodyText": "European leaders were expected to push ahead with plans for winding up or shoring up weak eurozone banks on Thursday night, hours after sealing agreement to put the European Central Bank in supervisory authority over financial institutions in the single currency area. In what was being hailed as one of the most important and systemic responses in three years of battling to save the currency, finance ministers early on Thursday embarked on the first stage of a eurozone \"banking union\", burying acute Franco-German differences to establish the first single banking supervisor. A two-day summit which opened on Thursday sought to build on the momentum, discussing calls for new legislation on eurozone banks' \"resolution\" to be drafted by next year. But more ambitious schemes, drawn up by the summit chair, president Herman Van Rompuy, to move towards a eurozone fiscal and political federation were watered down and delayed amid strong German resistance to any pooling of risk and costs among the currency's 17 countries. A draft communique on the summit's decisions said that a \"single resolution authority will be required, with the necessary powers to ensure that any bank can be resolved with the appropriate tools.\" The European commission, according to the draft, was told to draw up legislation for dealing with weak banks over the next year and the law should come into force in 2014. There was also talk of a common eurozone deposit guarantee scheme, the third plank in the banking union scheme, safeguarding people's savings anywhere in the single currency area. The Germans are balking at that notion, however, and are also wary of pooling responsibility for weak banks in other countries as the common scheme would see German banks being taxed to pay for bad banks elsewhere. \"Common bank resolution is difficult for them,\" said a senior diplomat, adding that the Dutch and the Finns, hawkish allies of the Germans on the euro crisis, were also reluctant to take on \"mutualisation\" of risk in the eurozone. Berlin has told Brussels to steer clear of tabling proposals on eurozone risk-sharing and cost-sharing before chancellor Angela Merkel contests an election for a third term next September. The proposed banks resolution regime is supposed to help cut the invidious link between failing banks and weak sovereigns that is seen as having contributed hugely to the sovereign debt crisis in countries such as Spain and Ireland. \"The single most important integrative step for the eurozone in 2013 is going to be the work to create a common resolution authority,\" said Mujtaba Rahman, European analyst at Eurasia Group. Under the single supervisory regime agreed on Thursday by finance ministers, though still to be finalised in talks with the European parliament, the ECB in Frankfurt is put in authority over up to 200 of the eurozone's 6,000 banks initially. A German campaign to restrict the scope of the supervisor won over French resistance. After more than 14 hours of fractious negotiations, the ministers agreed on the single supervisor as the first stage of a more comprehensive banking union. The next two stages may turn out to be more difficult to realise because of German-led reluctance to bow to the mutualisation of risk involved. But without them, it will also be difficult to see the new regime being effective, officials and diplomats say. The idea was first proposed in June when France, Italy, and Spain exploited the euro drama to hijack Germany into agreeing that the eurozone's bailout fund could be used to recapitalise directly ailing banks, say in Spain. The Germans were arm-twisted into agreeing, but insisted the recapitalisation could only take place if eurozone banks were placed under ECB authority. Within hours of that huge concession, the Germans got cold feet and have been rowing back ever since, seeking to delay the bank supervisor and restrict its powers and scope. It will be another 15 months before the new regime starts operating properly. Germany's finance minister, Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble, ascribed the time needed to the ECB, stressing that Mario Draghi, the ECB president, wanted a year to get the new system up and running. The UK chancellor, George Osborne, whose key aim from outside the eurozone was to safeguard the UK financial sector against ECB and eurozone interference by being automatically outvoted on rule changes, standards-setting, and regulation, claimed he got a good deal for Britain. \"The safeguards we have secured protect Britain's interests and the integrity of the European single market,\" said Osborne. \"We've always said a banking union was a necessary part of a more stable single currency for the eurozone, but also that single market for the whole of the European Union must be safeguarded. The agreement Britain has secured does that.\" Despite the progress on common bank regulation, the summit shaped up to be a humiliation for Van Rompuy at the hands of the Germans. His earlier proposals for eurobonds have been scrapped and demands last week for a eurozone \"fiscal capacity\" or special budget and insurance scheme were also dropped, although the draft still talked of a eurozone \"shock absorption capacity.\" Van Rompuy's first draft communique for the summit, envisaging a three-stage process towards a more complete monetary union, has had to be comprehensively rewritten while his proposals were belittled as a \"useful input\" rather than as the \"basis\" for the debate. Merkel did not rule out supplying \"financial incentives\" for eurozone countries pledging to undertake structural reforms of their economies, policed by Brussels. But she added: \"This should not be misunderstood. This can't be used as a pretext for delivering new sources of money. That's not on for Germany.\" The leaders also disbursed more than \u20ac34bn in bailout funds to Greece, six months after it was due, while postponing a decision on a bailout for Cyprus until next month.",

      "bodyText": "For a while AstraZeneca has been seeking new treatments to take over from its fading blockbuster drugs, but now it has suffered another setback. It announced that an experimental arthritis treatment proved no better than a drug from rival Abbott Laboratories in clinical trials, sending the company's shares 84p lower to 2958.5p. The study showed fostamatinib - given as a pill rather than an injection like Abbott's Humira - was better than a placebo but not as good as Humira. Analyst Savvas Neophytou at Panmure Gordon said: Fostamatinib is AstraZeneca's most likely blockbuster emerging from its pipeline. Results announced this morning from a phase IIb trial confirm the efficacy signal for the product, but failure to show it can match Humira's efficacy are likely to limit the product's commercial potential.

They might even be right.</p> <p>After more than 14 hours of fractious negotiations, finance ministers agreed to embark on a new era of single banking supervision in the eurozone, putting the European Central Bank in Frankfurt in a position of authority over, to begin with, up to 200 eurozone banks.</p> <p>The single supervisor is supposed to be the first stage of a more comprehensive \u201cbanking union\u201d, which should also entail a single eurozone resolution authority for winding up weak banks and a common guarantee system for eurozone depositors.</p> <p>These next two stages may turn out to be difficult to realise because of German-led reluctance to bow to the mutualisation of risk involved. But without them, it will also be difficult to see the new regime being effective.</p> <p>That\u2019s for the future. For the moment, despite the marathon session, a similar session last week that failed, and the tremendous frictions between Paris and Berlin over the scheme, this morning\u2019s agreement has been relatively quick.</p> <p>The idea was only first proposed in June at an EU summit when France, Italy, and Spain exploited the euro drama to hijack Germany into agreeing that the eurozone\u2019s bailout fund could be used to recapitalise directly ailing banks, say in Spain.</p> <p>The Germans were arm-twisted into agreeing, but insisted the recapitalisation could only take place if eurozone banks were placed under ECB authority. Within hours of that huge concession, the Germans got cold feet and have been rowing back ever since, seeking to delay the bank supervisor and restrict its powers and scope.</p> <p>The overnight deal indicates it will be another 15 months before the new regime starts operating and probably considerably longer before any direct bank recap can take place.</p> <p>It is a fiendishly complex business, legally and logistically. Six months from proposal to draft legislation and agreement among 27 governments is very quick by EU standards.</p> <p>George Osborne, whose key aim from outside the eurozone, was to safeguard the UK financial sector against ECB and eurozone interference by being automatically outvoted on rule changes, standards-setting, and regulation, claimed he got a good deal for Britain.</p> <p>This will all come out in the wash.</p> <p>The French argued they could not tolerate a system where \u201cBritain and some others\u201d could exercise a veto over eurozone decision-taking. Britain argued it would not be made a hostage of eurozone \u201ccaucussing\u201d. For the moment it looks as though neither can happen. Time will tell.</p> <p>When the dust settles, it should be clearer that the eurozone has embarked on one of the biggest systemic changes in three years of fighting to save the single currency, as well as moving towards a much more integrated and federated eurozone, financially, economically, and therefore politically.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2012-12-13T09:53:55.830Z\">at 9.53am GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-50c99cc1b579d49737370efd\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-12-13T09:15:45.086Z\">9.15am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Who will pay?</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>And back to today's main story, the breakthrough banking union agreed by Euorpean finance ministers in the early hours of this morning.

      "bodyText": "My colleague Heather Stewart (@heatherstewart3) has filed this story on S&amp;P putting the UK on negative outlook. Now it's time to shut up shop. We'll be back early Friday for more eurozone action. More on the S&amp;P move to put the UK's AAA rating on negative watch: And with that, we'll close for the evening. Thanks for all the comments and back tomorrow. European markets have - generally - edged lower after recent gains, as the EU summit gets underway. \u2022 The FTSE 100 has finished 0.27% or 16.24 points lower \u2022 Germany's Dax is down 0.43% \u2022 France's Cac has closed 0.1% lower \u2022 The Athens market is off 1.54% \u2022 But bucking the trend is Italy's FTSE MIB, up 0.64% \u2022... and Spain's Ibex, 0.38% better The Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently 0.43% or 56 points lower. European leaders are expected to push ahead with plans for winding up or shoring up weak eurozone banks, hours after sealing agreement to put the European Central Bank in supervisory authority over financial institutions in the single currency area, writes Ian Traynor. In what was being hailed as one of the most important and systemic responses in three years of battling to save the currency, finance ministers embarked on the first stage of a eurozone \u201cbanking union\u201d, burying acute Franco-German differences to establish the first single banking supervisor. A two-day summit which has just opened sought to build on the momentum, discussing calls for new legislation on eurozone banks\u2019 \u201cresolution\u201d to be drafted by next year. But more ambitious schemes, drawn up by the summit chair, President Herman Van Rompuy, to move towards a eurozone fiscal and political federation were watered down and delayed amid strong German resistance to any pooling of risk and costs among the currency\u2019s 17 countries. Ratings agency Standard &amp; Poor's has revised the UK outlook from stable to negative, although there is no downgrade to the AAA rating yet. There was much talk of the ratings agencies cutting the prized rating in the wake of the government missing its debt targets, with many saying it would not really matter anyway. S&amp;P reaffirmed the AAA but said: We expect the UK's net general government debt as a percentage of GDP to continue to rise in 2015, before declining again. We are therefore revising our outlook on the unsolicited long-term ratings on the UK to negative, from stable, reflecting our view of a one in three chance that we could lower the ratings if the UK's economic and fiscal performances weaken beyond our current expectations. EU president Herman Van Rompuy has welcomed last night's agreement on banking supervision, and maintained the worst of the eurozone crisis was now behind us: But of course much still needs to be done. Our objective for today is to map out our next steps towards a genuine Economic and Monetary Union. We must implement our agenda on competitiveness and on growth. Earlier this week in Oslo, I quoted Jean Monnet: \"It's better to fight around the table than on a battlefield.\" But around such tables, it's even better to reach agreements, and that's what I now propose for today and tomorrow! Full opening remarks here. And here we have another European announcement on banks which stops short of a full agreement. The EU has failed to agree an overall deal to implement Basel 111 rules which require banks to hold more capital against the possibility of a major failure, following a meeting in Strasbourg. But progress was apparently made, and another get together will take place on Tuesday. According to Reuters, Austria's Othmar Karas said: \"We are on the cusp of an agreement.\" The plan is to get agreement to introduce the new rules in January 2014, which would include a cap on bankers' bonuses. A dispute had arisen over suggestions that bonuses should not be more than the size of a banker's salary. But a compromise was reached that with shareholder approval, this could rise to two times salary. This comes after the all nighter in Brussels which saw agreement on giving the ECB supervisory powers over the region's banks. There was some controversy about the lists of supposed tax evaders given to the Greek government, which seemed to have been misplaced for a while. And now Spain is apparently preparing to name names too: And it looks like we're underway. A summing up of the Italian job: And more: Away from the eurozone, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently edging lower, much in the vein of the European markets. The US data out today seemed pretty reasonable but no one wanted to take any chances as the US fiscal cliff - ie budget - talks continued with the outcome uncertain. Still, US retail sales rose in November after falling in October, while weekly jobless claims fell sharply last week, down 29,000 to 343,000. The unemployment rate was, of course, one of the key factors the US Federal Reserve identified as heavily influencing its interest rate setting policy. And with that I'm going to hand over to my colleague Nick Fletcher. Thanks for all your comments. George Osborne is making his delayed appearance before MPs on the Treasury select committee. He is being asked about comments by Bank of England governor elect Mark Carney that the UK should drop its inflation targets in favour of more radical monetary policy. But Osborne says that if you were to move away from inflation targets you need to see \"very significant rewards\". He adds that he doesn't think it would be sensible for him to openly speculate about any new Bank framework. He says: If you want to change the regime you have to make a pretty strong case for doing so. My colleague Andrew Sparrow is live blogging Osborne here. Meanwhile, the Greek media is replete with positive reports that the debt-stricken nation is on course to get even more rescue funds than expected \u2013 thanks to Germany (yes, that\u2019s right). Our correspondent Helena Smith writes: Even before today\u2019s euro group meeting, the leading daily, Ta Nea, had summed up the decision it was likely to yield with the following headline: Last Act for the mammoth installment. 'The amount of aid that will be given by the eurozone [to Greece] by the end of March, and whose disbursement is expected to be approved by the euro group, will be up to \u20ac49.1bn.' The last Eurogroup, it reminded readers, had decided to disburse \u20ac34.4bn in December (which has now come true) and \u20ac9.3bn in three separate installments through to March. Factor in the contribution from the IMF, the paper trilled, and the total amount would come to \u20ac52.5bn (the additional amount being used to cover the repurchasing of Greek debt). \u201cIn Germany the finance ministry has come out in favour of the installment being disbursed,\u201d it enthused. \u201cIt said indications show that the buyback program 'went very, very well.'\u201d EU diplomats, based in Athens, however, have a more reserved outlook. One cautioned against Greece over-interpreting the decision as a \u201cvote of confidence in its efforts when it\u2019s more about the EU not wanting Greece to go under\". Foreign observers worry that, as had been the case before, Athens will see the disbursement as an excuse to relax implementation of long-overdue structural reforms. The centre-left candidate, Pier Luigi Bersani, who is leading the polls to become the next prime minister, has already said that he could offer Mario Monti a role in his government, according to a report in the Italian press. Here comes Italian PM, Mario Monti. Some say his appearance at the summit suggests he will be running in the elections. With Berlusconi already inside, the dynamics could be interesting. Jean-Claude Juncker, on the other hand, is looking somewhat preoccupied. Here come the pictures of the politicians arriving. EC president Jose Manuel Barroso, for one, looks like a happy man. The Greek prime minister, Antonis Samaras, is not missing out on the euphoria, reports Helena Smith. Samaras told reporters in Brussels: Solidarity in our Union is alive. Grexit is dead. Greece is back on its feet. The sacrifices of the Greek people have not been in vain. Today is not only a new day for Greece, it is indeed a new day for Europe. So for a quick lunchtime roundup and, to make a change, there's a lot of good news around today... Eurozone finance ministers have agreed to give the ECB powers to act as supervisor to the region's biggest banks. The so-called single supervisory mechanism (SSM) will kick in in March 2014. (see 9.25am for Ian Traynor's take on the deal) The Eurogorup has decided to release the next \u20ac49.1bn tranche of aid to Greece, with \u20ac34.4bn to be released this month. (see 11.02am and following) Spain and Italy's borrowing costs came down at bond auctions earlier today. (see 9.59am and 10.17am) Now the current Italian prime minister, Mario Monti, is speaking in Brussels but will not be drawn on his future. He says: It seems more important that the next Italian government stays committed with the EU policy than to speak on my personal situation. The decision has prompted rather more muted jubilation on Twitter. In Greece, today\u2019s decision to release \u20ac41.9bn of aid to the crisis-hit country has been greeted expected with joy and jubilation, reports our correspondent Helena Smith. She writes: All\u2019s well that end\u2019s well. Greek officials, predictably, are both thrilled by the announcement. After an endless summer of nail-biting negotiations the relief both in Athens - and among the Greek delegation in Brussels - is almost palpable. \u201cThis is a big day for Greece,\u201d the country\u2019s finance minister Yiannis Stournaras told reporters. In Athens one senior official described the decision to release the aid as \"a dream come true.\" In Brussels, the European commission president, Jos\u00e9 Manuel Barroso, has told journalists he has spoken to Berlusconi. He said: I spoke with Mr Berlusconi yesterday early afternoon. It was a personal conversation. I stressed importance of stability in Italy. Back in the UK, the CBI industrial trends showed a small improvement in December, suggesting that manufacturing output may have stabilised towards the end of the year. The survey shows that the balance of manufacturers reporting that their orders are at normal levels jumped to -12% in December from -21% in November and -23% in October. This took it appreciably above the long-term average of -17% for the orders balance. Howard Archer of IHS Global Insight said: A significantly improved December CBI industrial trends survey offers some grounds for optimism for manufacturers going into 2013 after they suffered a pretty torrid end to a largely difficult 2012. However, domestic and international conditions clearly remain challenging for manufacturers and they are unsurprisingly cautious over the outlook. Furthermore, it still looks highly likely that manufacturing output will see appreciable contraction in the fourth quarter and will weigh down on GDP. Given that manufacturing output plunged 1.3% month-on-month in October with most sectors suffering, it will have taken a substantial pick up in output in November and December to prevent marked contraction in the fourth quarter and the survey evidence from the CBI and the purchasing managers suggest this has not happened. The leaders are arriving for an enlarged summit of the European People's party. This involves EU and non-EU heads of state and government and opposition leaders along with the presidents of the European council and the European commission, to prepare for the European council later in the day, which continues tomorrow. And among the star guests, none other than former Italian prime minister, Silvio Berlusconi. The Eurogroup has issued its statement on Greece and one on Cyprus. Some highlights... Re Greece: The Eurogroup welcomed the result of the debt buy back operation, which will lead to a substantial reduction of the Greek debt-to-GDP ratio. The Eurogroup reaffirmed that this, together with the initiatives agreed by the Eurogroup on 27 November and full implementation of the adjustment programme, should bring Greece's public debt back on a sustainable path, to 124% of GDP in 2020. Greece and the other euro area Member States are prepared to take additional measures, if necessary, to ensure that this objective is met. Re Cyprus: We are confident that agreement on the programme could soon be reached, and we call on the international institutions and Cyprus to finalise negotiations accordingly. The IMF chief, Christine Lagarde, has confirmed that she will recommend the disbursement of aid to Greece. She also says additional debt relief for Greece was possible. I expect that a Board meeting could take place in January, for the first review of Greece's Fund-supported program. These steps will ensure that Greece\u2019s debt-to-GDP declines to 124% by 2020 and to substantially below 110% by 2022, she adds. Can we have a decision on Cyprus in January? asks another journalist. Juncker says he doesn't want to be held to a timetable but they will work to find a solution as quickly as possible. And with that they are gone. With Juncker in this kind of mood it's not wonder the meeting was so quick. Juncker is asked when there will be discussions over who will take over from him. He says: I am still alive. I will talk to Van Rompuy today and all the initiatives needed will be taken. Juncker is being rather laconic in his responses. On Cyprus he says: I don't want to draw an alarming picture of Cyprus. The problem of Cyprus is serious and we are tackling this problem in a serious way. Juncker says it is not certain that we will need additional measures to help Greece get its debt down. But if we do we are prepared to use them. He said the IMF is, of course, participating in distributing aid to Greece. Klaus Regling, chief executive of the bailout fund the EFSF, says the fund has issued bonds worth \u20ac120bn this year. Half of that raised directly in the markets. \u20ac40bn in long-term, \u20ac20bn in short-term bills. So total aid paid out to Greece between now and March will be \u20ac49.1bn, which all falls within the overall \u20ac109bn package previously agreed. \u20ac34.4bn of that will be disbursed in December. We also discussed a reform programme for Cyprus. The Cypriot authorities have moved swiftly to adopt measures. An encouraging sign. We are now looking forward to receiving final results of due diligence on Cyprus' banking sector in January. After focusing on disagreements in negotiations on single supervisory mechanism for eurozone banks, let me ask you how many people would have believed that we could have agreed this so quickly. Today we have put in an essential block of the banking union. We hardly made it to the full time (of the meeting) - only 90 minutes long, says Rehn. (They are obviously very pleased with how short this meeting was.) He said the decision to release aid to Greece will open the way for a return of confidence of growth and job creation for the Greek people. As we approach the end of this turbulent year, Cassandras have been proven wrong. (Plenty of classical references here). Greece has got its programme back on track. Eurozone has made good on its word to support Greece. Message to Greece (from Rehn) - the EU stands by you and will continue to do so. They were also discussing Cyprus. We consider that progress has been made towards a possible macro financial assistance programme for Cyprus. We welcome their commitment to reforms - Juncker. He's now passing over to Olli Rehn. More money will be disbursed subsequently. We are prepared to take additional measures if necessary to ensure Greece gets on a sustainable path to reduce deb - Juncker. This was the shortest meeting ever of the Eurogroup, says Juncker. With the strong resolve of the Greek government we are convinced the programme is back on track. We are willing to take measures to make sure it stays that way. Money will be flowing to Greece as early as next week. As expected the Eurogroup has agreed to disburse a \u20ac34.4bn tranche of aid to Greece (plus more early next year), which has been delayed since June. This morning's Eurogroup meeting of eurozone finance ministers is over and its president, Jean-Claude Juncker, will give a press conference shortly alongside European commissioner Olli Rehn. You can watch it live here and we'll be reporting all the key points. The head of Italy's centre-left Democratic party, Pier Luigi Bersani, said Berlusconi's goal is to distract the public, but that he will lose. Bersani, whom polls tip to be Italy's next leader, said the rigour brought in by current prime minister, Mario Monti, \"must continue\". That sounds a touch contrary to his assertion yesterday that Monti should not run in the next elections. He also warns that Germany is at risk of a bubble with negative real rates. Reports are coming through on Twitter that the Dutch finance minister, Jeroen Dijsselbloem, says banks will be restructured before the ECB takes on its role as banking supervisor. And Italy's borrowing costs have also come down. It sold a 2015 bond at a yeild of 2.5% compared with 2.64% in November, the lowest yield since October 2010. And still the Greek unemployment rate continues to climb. Data shows almost one in four are unemployed, with joblessness up at 24.8% in the third quarter from 23.6% in the second. That is up from 17.7% this time last year. Unemployment among young people (between 15 and 24 year olds) is 56.6%. The president of the European commission, Jos\u00e9 Manuel Barroso, has welcomed the deal as a \"crucial and substantive step\" towards banking union. On behalf of the European Commission, I warmly welcome this exceptionally important agreement on the Single Supervisory Mechanism reached by the Council. Based on the proposal tabled by the Commission on 12 September, this is a crucial and very substantive step towards completion of the banking union and a timely step forward in the integration of financial supervision for the euro area and for the other Member States which the Commission hopes will also participate. We now hope that the co-legislators are able to finalize the agreement on the Single Supervisory Mechanism as quickly as possible. I want to underline that in four months we have moved from a Commission proposal to political agreement by the Council, which demonstrates once again that the European Union has the political will and capacity to act quickly on momentous issues. Spain's borrrowing costs have come down after an auction of more than \u20ac2bn of bonds. It sold bonds maturing in 2015 with a yield of 3.358%, down from 3.39% on 5 December Bonds maturing in 2017 with a yield of 4.2% compared with 4.766% previously And bonds maturing in 2040 with a yield of 5.893%. And Angela Merkel's fake Twitter account has an entertaining take on the EU deal. George Osborne has been delayed in Brussels so won't be appearing before the Treasury Select Committee to defend his autumn statement at 10am as planned. The select committee said: No decision has yet been taken as to when it will take place. The session may still happen this afternoon, if not it will likely be next week. Sticking with the banking union, Eurointelligence has provided another helpful summary of what has been agreed so far... The ECB will be the regulator of banks with assets of more than \u20ac30bn, or banks constituting at least one fifth of their home country\u2019s GDP. The thresholds were chosen to include the three biggest banks in each country. The estimates last night range from a total number of 150 to 200 banks in the eurozone. The ECB can intervene in smaller banks (under a procedure that has yet to be made known, or yet to be worked out) The governance structure will consist of a separate supervisory body, the ECB governing council as final arbiter, and a steering committee to solve disagreement. Agreement to be finalised in February 2013 \u2013 as this requires support from the European parliament. The single supervisory mechanism (SSM) kicks in March 2014. The EBA will continue to be in charge of harmonising rules at EU-level, and there will be safeguards for the non-eurozone members through a double majority \u2013 one inside the banking union, one outside. No direct bank recapitalisation by the ESM until at least 2014. It also poses some questions that still need answering: Is the \u20ac30bn a fixed nominal sum, will it get adjusted over time? Will banks automatically switch regime once they exceed the total? How and when this is determined? Does the threshold include off-balance sheet vehicles? If No, then the arrangement would give banks an incentive to circumvent the rule; Can the ECB decide whether to usurp authority over a smaller bank on its own, or does it need approval of any other body? Do banks have legal redress to such a decision under national law? Can the SSM give, and enforce, instructions to national supervisors? Does the SSM have full access to all information held by national supervisors? Via the FT. Our European editor, Ian Traynor, writes of the deal from Brussels: Another late night/early morning in Brussels, another hard-fought compromise that will be dubbed \u201chistoric\u201d, \u201cpioneering\u201d, \u201ccritical\u201d by EU policy-makers and officials. They might even be right. After more than 14 hours of fractious negotiations, finance ministers agreed to embark on a new era of single banking supervision in the eurozone, putting the European Central Bank in Frankfurt in a position of authority over, to begin with, up to 200 eurozone banks. The single supervisor is supposed to be the first stage of a more comprehensive \u201cbanking union\u201d, which should also entail a single eurozone resolution authority for winding up weak banks and a common guarantee system for eurozone depositors. These next two stages may turn out to be difficult to realise because of German-led reluctance to bow to the mutualisation of risk involved. But without them, it will also be difficult to see the new regime being effective. That\u2019s for the future. For the moment, despite the marathon session, a similar session last week that failed, and the tremendous frictions between Paris and Berlin over the scheme, this morning\u2019s agreement has been relatively quick. The idea was only first proposed in June at an EU summit when France, Italy, and Spain exploited the euro drama to hijack Germany into agreeing that the eurozone\u2019s bailout fund could be used to recapitalise directly ailing banks, say in Spain. The Germans were arm-twisted into agreeing, but insisted the recapitalisation could only take place if eurozone banks were placed under ECB authority. Within hours of that huge concession, the Germans got cold feet and have been rowing back ever since, seeking to delay the bank supervisor and restrict its powers and scope. The overnight deal indicates it will be another 15 months before the new regime starts operating and probably considerably longer before any direct bank recap can take place. It is a fiendishly complex business, legally and logistically. Six months from proposal to draft legislation and agreement among 27 governments is very quick by EU standards. George Osborne, whose key aim from outside the eurozone, was to safeguard the UK financial sector against ECB and eurozone interference by being automatically outvoted on rule changes, standards-setting, and regulation, claimed he got a good deal for Britain. This will all come out in the wash. The French argued they could not tolerate a system where \u201cBritain and some others\u201d could exercise a veto over eurozone decision-taking. Britain argued it would not be made a hostage of eurozone \u201ccaucussing\u201d. For the moment it looks as though neither can happen. Time will tell. When the dust settles, it should be clearer that the eurozone has embarked on one of the biggest systemic changes in three years of fighting to save the single currency, as well as moving towards a much more integrated and federated eurozone, financially, economically, and therefore politically. And back to today's main story, the breakthrough banking union agreed by Euorpean finance ministers in the early hours of this morning. Reuters has written a very handy factbox on the deal. This highlights one of the big unanswered questions: who will pay? The Reuters reporters write: Any agency [to close down failing banks] would need to be backed by a fund to cover the costs involved in winding down banks. A resolution fund provides emergency financing so that when a bank fails, those parts of the bank are kept alive to continue payments and lending, while the rest is liquidated. But Germany does not want to find itself on the hook for costs associated with closing a bank in Spain, for example, which will make it difficult to set up such a fund. They also contradict earlier reports of a common deposit guarantee. The third and final pillar of a banking union is a combined scheme to protect deposits to stop bank runs. But this has little political backing and there is no prospect of such a framework in the near term. And a quick post on Italian consumer price inflation, which has come in at 2.6% for the year to November. That's down 0.3% on the previous month, confirming preliminary estimates. European markets show an interesting mix this morning: shares in the southern, crisis-hit countries are up, while those in the northern, creditor countries are down. Fears that deeper integration will end in bigger bailout bills perhaps. UK FTSE 100: down 0.2%, or 12 points at 5934 Germany DAX: down 0.54% France CAC 40: down 0.19% Spain IBEX: up 0.5% Italy FTSE MIB: up 0.3% Eurozone finance ministers are arriving for their meeting to discuss Greece and Cyprus. President of the Eurogroup, Jean-Claude Juncker, has said on his way in that he does not expect a financial aid package for Cyprus to be agreed today but that it will probably come early next year. I don't think that we can find a definitive solution for Cyprus today. It will probably be done in January. Reuters reports: Cyprus, one of the smallest economies in the 17-nation euro zone, sought aid in June to buffer banks substantially exposed to debt-crippled Greece. It says it has agreed a preliminary aid deal with the European Union and the International Monetary Fund. The cost of recapitalising the island's banking sector could be as high as 10 billion euros - more than half of Cyprus's annual output. But Olli Rehn of the ECB is confident of a decision on the way forward for Greece. Rather poetically, he says the Eurogroup decision will \"remove clouds\". Meanwhile, Angela Merkel has added some rousing comments to her speech to the German parliament. She is convinced Europe will emerge stronger from its crisis, and hopes the EU will agree a roadmap for more concrete steps to strengthen competitiveness at today's summit. She reiterates Germany's opposition to the long-term mutualisation of debt in any form ie Germany is not willing to foot the bill for Greek borrowing. She says Europe cannot live on the services sector alone, but also needs industrial production. Europe has come a long way towards stability but there is still more work to do, she says. And on Greece, she believes the bond buyback agreed this week qualifies it for the delayed tranche of aid that the finance ministers are discussing today. And the Swiss national bank has kept rates on hold at 0%, as expected, but says it is ready to take further measures any time. It's a busy day today. It looks like the poor eurozone finance ministers will have to get up again and hold yet another meeting at 9am (after a few snatched hours of sleep), this time to agree on whether to let Greece have its next slice of aid. The EU leaders are holding a summit in Brussels; and the ECB and IMF are holding a joint conference on fiscal governance. Angela Merkel addresses Bundestag: 8am Eurozone finance ministers meet on Greece: 9am ECB publishes report for December: 9am Italy inflation for November: 9am George Osborne in Treasury select committee to defend autumn statement: 10am Italy's Democratic leader Pier Luigi Bersani (Silvio Berlusconi's main rival) holds press conference: 10am UK CBI industrial trends: 11am More Merkel coming through on the wires (see below). She says she hopes the Eurogroup (of eurozone finance ministers) will agree today to pay out the next Greek aid tranche. Greek state and banks need the money to revive the economy. And she says that the efforts of the Greek government to reform deserve Germany's support. Supporting individual member states helps the entire eurozone. Angela Merkel is speaking in the German parliament and has hailed the concessions won by her finance minister Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble. She says he managed to push through Germany's main demands on the EU bank supervision deal. She also says she cannot overstate the importance of the deal. It looks like this push for greater integration could make it harder for new countries to join the union. Merkel is saying the EU needs tougher admission rules for new members. There have been concessions made to both Germany and the UK in the new eurozone banking union. Germany was concerned the ECB would wield too much power under the new regime. The fear was that the ECB's dual roles of bank supervisor and guardian of monetary policy could throw up a conflict of interest. For example, the ECB might be inclined to keep rates low to prop up the banks, which may not be prudent with regards to inflation etc. So it was agreed to introduce a mediation panel to resolve disputes with national supervisors to provide a counterbalance to the ECB's power. That was, apparently, enough for Germany's finance minister Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble. The UK, for its part, was concerned that any new union would undermine the authority of the City of London, in terms of defining the capital buffers banks must have and so on. So, it was decided that when the European Banking Authority votes on these measures, there will be a double vote: one for those in the banking union and another for non-euro countries. There has been a long road to get to this point, with months of tortuous negotiations, culminating in last night's meeting, which lasted for more than 14 hours. The deal was struck in the early hours of this morning, so there were probably some bleary-eyed finance ministers staggering back to their hotel rooms just a few hours ago. (It remains to be seen if they will still be meeting later today to discuss Greece and Cyprus). [Correction: the agreement this morning is on bank supervision. While the rest may come at some stage, it has not yet been agreed. Apologies.] But first some detail on the nature of the deal, which can be broken down into three main pillars: 1) A common banking supervisor The European Central Bank will be given the power to supervise all the major banks within the eurozone, and intervene if any gets into trouble. This could then lead to... A common resolution scheme: This would come into play if any eurozone bank gets into trouble. The common resolution scheme would decide whether to bail the bank out or let it go bust, with eurozone governments jointly bearing the cost of any bailout. A common deposit guarantee: A European version of the Financial Services Compensation Scheme. Anyone who puts money in an ordinary bank account anywhere in the eurozone would have their money guaranteed by a eurozone fund, up to a limit, expected to be \u20ac100,000. Good morning and welcome to our rolling coverage of the eurozone crisis. The big news this morning is that eurozone finance ministers have agreed to give the ECB powers to police eurozone banks, marking the first step on the road to closer integration. We'll have market reaction, analyst comment and all the ramifications of this huge step during the day.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Britain has slipped two places down Europe's league table of living standards, falling to sixth after being overtaken by Austria and Germany, the European Union's statistical body said. With high inflation eroding spending power in Britain, Eurostat said actual individual consumption (AIC) per head dropped from 120% of the EU average in 2010 to 118% in 2011. Living standards in the UK have been hit since the onset of recession in 2008 by higher unemployment, higher taxes, and failure of wages to keep pace with prices. Bank of England governor Sir Mervyn King warned at the end of 2011 that households suffered the biggest squeeze since the Great Depression of the 1930s. The Eurostat figures coincided with a report from the Department for Communities and Local Government showing that a decade of progress in tackling deprivation was reversed in 2009 \u2013 the year when the slump was the deepest. In his decade as chancellor, Gordon Brown made a priority of tackling poverty and the DCLG data shows income deprivation fell on average between 1999 and 2008. The most deprived communities in Britain saw the biggest drop in deprivation but then suffered from the biggest increases in 2009. The DCLG report divided Britain's local communities into tenths and ranked them by the level of deprivation. It found the downturn of 2008-09 was so severe that only the two poorest deciles had lower levels of deprivation in 2009 than they had in 1999. Hackney, Knowsley, Manchester and Lambeth featured in the list of the 10 most deprived authorities in every year from 1999 to 2009. Eurostat, which looks at living standards for countries inside and outside the EU, said the top five countries for living standards in 2011 were Luxembourg (140% of the EU average), Norway (135%), Switzerland (130%), Germany (120%) and Austria (119%). Inside the EU living standards were lowest in Bulgaria (45% of the EU average) and Romania (47%), although Europe's debt crisis has taken a heavy toll of AIC per head in Greece, where it has fallen from 104% of the EU average in 2009 to 91% in 2011. Eurostat reported smaller declines in living standards in the other countries at the centre of the sovereign debt storm \u2013 Ireland, Spain and Portugal. AIC per head is often used as an alternative to gross domestic product as a way of measuring living standards. It includes the services households consume, such as benefits in kind including health and education. Using GDP per head as a yardstick, the UK was 10th in the EU table of living standards in 2011, unchanged from the previous year. Luxembourg was comfortably the best off EU country on this measure, with GDP per head at 271% of the average, compared with 109% in Britain. Eurostat's comparison of living costs showed the UK was the 14th most expensive country in the EU in 2011, up from 15th most expensive in 2010. Prices were 3% above the EU average.",
