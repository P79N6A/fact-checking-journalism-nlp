      "bodyText": "Security firm G4S has hit back at allegations of contract overcharging, accusing court and prison services of failing to pass on vital information to prevent bills on electronic tagging contracts stacking up. Pointing the finger back at justice secretary Chris Grayling, who has called on the Serious Fraud Office to launch a criminal investigation, G4S told the Guardian: \"We have not overcharged the Ministry of Justice, but have always billed in line with the contract.\" Grayling told MPs the overcharging, worth tens of millions of pounds, included billing for tracking people who had moved abroad, returned to prison or even died. But the firm claimed: \"We will always stop charging when a curfew order formally ends. However, when no end date is given, as in bail cases, we have no legal authority to suspend or close a curfew order. We must receive specific instructions from the courts or a prison in these cases.\" It is unclear, however, what action G4S took to alert the prison and court services in cases where it knew the offender was in a prison or had left the country \u2013 even if a curfew order had not been ended. Whitehall sources have said allegations should be examined that the justice ministry was being billed for the tagging of 18,000 offenders a day when only 15,000 were actually being monitored \u2013 raising the prospect of 3,000 \"phantom\" offenders, or one in six of all those on tags. An official referral is yet to be received by the Serious Fraud Office but it is not certain that SFO director David Green will take up the investigation Grayling has called for \u2013 or, if he does, whether he will limit it to G4S. . G4S yesterday claimed its hands were tied on how it billed for tagging offenders. It said it had no legal authority to close or suspend a curfew order, something it said could only be done at the behest of a prison or the courts. Of the most shocking allegation \u2013 that G4S had continued to charge for tagging offenders after their death \u2013 the security firm said it could find almost no evidence to support such claims, suggesting they had been \"taken out of all proportion\". The company said it had found one case where the Ministry of Justice had been charged \u00a360 for two days beyond the death of the offender. The sum had been repaid, the company said. A Ministry of Justice spokesman declined to comment, referring back to Grayling's statement to parliament on Thursday.Despite inheriting one of the worse corporate reputations in the outsourcing industry following the fiasco around its botched provision of security staff to the Olympic games last year, new G4S chief executive Ashley Almanza is determined to show he is uncowed and will not pushed around by ministers. The approach is in marked contrast to that of rival Serco, which has acceded to Grayling's demands for an independent forensic investigation of its tagging operations and a review of certain other contracts.

      "body": "<p>In Bulwell, on the northern edge of Nottingham, in the bright July sunshine, hard-hatted construction workers are setting up a lawn sprinkler to soak the grass of a pristine children's playground, while saleswoman Lorraine escorts keen young couples around a trim little show home.</p> <p>There will be 40 houses here, on the site of a bulldozed former council estate, and the developer, Keepmoat, which specialises in regeneration projects, can't sell them quickly enough.</p> <p>Like many smaller builders, Keepmoat suffered badly during the depths of the downturn, shutting down its Midlands operation altogether in 2008 \u2013 but it is due to build 600 properties locally this year and 2,000 across Britain.</p> <p>You don't have to go far to see why: for the first time since the onset of the financial crisis more than five years ago, the local property market is looking up.</p> <p>\"Buyers are far, far more confident than they've been for a number of years,\" says Karen Eccles, manager of the Beeston estate agency branch of the Nottingham building society. In leafy Wollaton, close to the rolling Wootton Park and the main A52 to Derby, she proudly shows off a smart-looking four-bedroom detached house that sold within a fortnight, just below its \u00a3440,000 asking price. Another, modern property nearby with a sunny garden went on the market on Saturday, at \u00a3410,000, and was snapped up by the end of Monday.</p> <p>A year ago, Eccles says, either of these homes could have sat on her books for months; now, when new prospective sellers come into the office, she can point to a string of local sales in recent months. \"It was really busy in March and April: we were putting things on like crazy\".</p> <p>A few minutes up the road in less affluent Bilborough, a neat ex-council house has just been snapped up, again within two weeks, for just below the asking price of \u00a389,950.</p> <p>Lorraine Giddings, head of the Nottingham's branch network, says viewings in the first six months of 2013 were the same period last year, and sales up 30%. \"That's the feedback from other agents as well: the market is definitely more buoyant, and customers are definitely feeling more confident,\" she says.</p> <p>After five years when most housing markets outside London and the south-east remained in the deep freeze, the revival in Nottingham is reflected across a growing number of areas.</p> <p>Simon Rubinsohn, chief economist at the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors, whose latest survey showed a marked improvement, says: \"If you look at the underlying trend, it certainly suggests that things are picking up in certain parts of the country.\"</p> <p>The newfound sense of optimism has not sprung up in a vacuum. Cheaper mortgages have helped. The Bank of England's Funding for Lending policy, launched a year ago, gives banks cut-price loans so that they can reduce the costs of borrowing for their customers.</p> <p>Lenders have responded with bargain borrowing deals, many of them offering fixed rates for up to five years \u2013 rare before the crisis. With prices in many areas still well below their pre-crisis peak (by 6.4% in central Nottingham, for example), the banks have also started to relax some of their lending criteria. A report from the surveyors e.surv last week suggested high loan-to-value mortgages, worth at least 85% of the value of the property, are at their highest level since 2008.</p> <p>Richard Donnell, director of research at the housing data firm Hometrack, said: \"Some of these mortgages are very attractive for people, and then it only takes a pick-up in confidence, and they decide to move.\"</p> <p>He argues that Funding for Lending has been a much more important driver of the surge in property transactions than the government's Help to Buy scheme, launched at the budget. The first part of Help to Buy, which is already available, offers five-year interest-free loans to the buyers of newbuild properties.</p> <p>The much larger second element of Help to Buy will begin in January 2014, offering taxpayer-backed mortgage guarantees \u2013 an idea questioned by, among others, Sir Mervyn King and the Treasury select committee.</p> <p>The chancellor, George Osborne, hopes that boosting demand, by making more mortgages available, will prompt Britain's builders to crank up thousands of new projects up and down the country, helping to tackle the housing shortage.</p> <p>But Roger Harding, head of policy at homelessness charity Shelter, warns that the big private-sector housebuilders that dominating the market are unlikely to build the right mix of housing at the right pace.</p> <h2>Homelessness</h2> <p>\"The builders are open about how they are moving towards a lower volume, higher margin model, which is good for their profitability, but won't deliver the housing we need for society.\"</p> <p>In a report to be published next week, Shelter argues that the government's package of housing policies will fall woefully short of the 250,000-a-year building target many experts see as necessary to keep pace with rising demand and tackle homelessness.</p> <p>It's hard not to agree with Keepmoat's spokesman, Shaun Fielding, that the bright new homes in Riverside View are more appealing than the cheek-by-jowl ex-council properties that adjoin the site; but at \u00a3110,000 (up from \u00a395,000 when they first went on the market a year ago), they are unlikely to be within reach of the residents of the homes that were demolished to make way for them.</p> <p>Harding fears that in the short term, the main result of improved mortgage availability will just be a renewed surge in prices.

      "bodyText": "In Bulwell, on the northern edge of Nottingham, in the bright July sunshine, hard-hatted construction workers are setting up a lawn sprinkler to soak the grass of a pristine children's playground, while saleswoman Lorraine escorts keen young couples around a trim little show home. There will be 40 houses here, on the site of a bulldozed former council estate, and the developer, Keepmoat, which specialises in regeneration projects, can't sell them quickly enough. Like many smaller builders, Keepmoat suffered badly during the depths of the downturn, shutting down its Midlands operation altogether in 2008 \u2013 but it is due to build 600 properties locally this year and 2,000 across Britain. You don't have to go far to see why: for the first time since the onset of the financial crisis more than five years ago, the local property market is looking up. \"Buyers are far, far more confident than they've been for a number of years,\" says Karen Eccles, manager of the Beeston estate agency branch of the Nottingham building society. In leafy Wollaton, close to the rolling Wootton Park and the main A52 to Derby, she proudly shows off a smart-looking four-bedroom detached house that sold within a fortnight, just below its \u00a3440,000 asking price. Another, modern property nearby with a sunny garden went on the market on Saturday, at \u00a3410,000, and was snapped up by the end of Monday. A year ago, Eccles says, either of these homes could have sat on her books for months; now, when new prospective sellers come into the office, she can point to a string of local sales in recent months. \"It was really busy in March and April: we were putting things on like crazy\". A few minutes up the road in less affluent Bilborough, a neat ex-council house has just been snapped up, again within two weeks, for just below the asking price of \u00a389,950. Lorraine Giddings, head of the Nottingham's branch network, says viewings in the first six months of 2013 were the same period last year, and sales up 30%. \"That's the feedback from other agents as well: the market is definitely more buoyant, and customers are definitely feeling more confident,\" she says. After five years when most housing markets outside London and the south-east remained in the deep freeze, the revival in Nottingham is reflected across a growing number of areas. Simon Rubinsohn, chief economist at the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors, whose latest survey showed a marked improvement, says: \"If you look at the underlying trend, it certainly suggests that things are picking up in certain parts of the country.\" The newfound sense of optimism has not sprung up in a vacuum. Cheaper mortgages have helped. The Bank of England's Funding for Lending policy, launched a year ago, gives banks cut-price loans so that they can reduce the costs of borrowing for their customers. Lenders have responded with bargain borrowing deals, many of them offering fixed rates for up to five years \u2013 rare before the crisis. With prices in many areas still well below their pre-crisis peak (by 6.4% in central Nottingham, for example), the banks have also started to relax some of their lending criteria. A report from the surveyors e.surv last week suggested high loan-to-value mortgages, worth at least 85% of the value of the property, are at their highest level since 2008. Richard Donnell, director of research at the housing data firm Hometrack, said: \"Some of these mortgages are very attractive for people, and then it only takes a pick-up in confidence, and they decide to move.\" He argues that Funding for Lending has been a much more important driver of the surge in property transactions than the government's Help to Buy scheme, launched at the budget. The first part of Help to Buy, which is already available, offers five-year interest-free loans to the buyers of newbuild properties. The much larger second element of Help to Buy will begin in January 2014, offering taxpayer-backed mortgage guarantees \u2013 an idea questioned by, among others, Sir Mervyn King and the Treasury select committee. The chancellor, George Osborne, hopes that boosting demand, by making more mortgages available, will prompt Britain's builders to crank up thousands of new projects up and down the country, helping to tackle the housing shortage. But Roger Harding, head of policy at homelessness charity Shelter, warns that the big private-sector housebuilders that dominating the market are unlikely to build the right mix of housing at the right pace. Homelessness \"The builders are open about how they are moving towards a lower volume, higher margin model, which is good for their profitability, but won't deliver the housing we need for society.\" In a report to be published next week, Shelter argues that the government's package of housing policies will fall woefully short of the 250,000-a-year building target many experts see as necessary to keep pace with rising demand and tackle homelessness. It's hard not to agree with Keepmoat's spokesman, Shaun Fielding, that the bright new homes in Riverside View are more appealing than the cheek-by-jowl ex-council properties that adjoin the site; but at \u00a3110,000 (up from \u00a395,000 when they first went on the market a year ago), they are unlikely to be within reach of the residents of the homes that were demolished to make way for them. Harding fears that in the short term, the main result of improved mortgage availability will just be a renewed surge in prices. In the capital, where the top end of the housing market has been turbocharged by foreign investment, the recovery began more than a year ago. The gap between London house prices and those in the rest of the country is at a record high, and the skyline is already thick with cranes. Here, building is happening on a gargantuan scale. At Nine Elms, the mind-bogglingly large \u00a315bn regeneration scheme on the south bank of the Thames, around Battersea power station, 16,000 new homes will be built over the next few years. Local councillors, led by Lib Peck, the Labour leader of Lambeth council, the co-chair of the Nine Elms Partnership, have battled to extract the highest proportion of affordable homes they can from developers \u2013 about 30% on most of the sites in the borough. But Peck admits that it's a tough struggle: \"The aspiration is to make sure it feels like a place \u2013 we don't want it to be bolted on, so that it's alien to our existing population.\" But so far, one of the few completed developments is the swanky St George's Tower, which offers, \"exceptional interior design, elegant exteriors and breathtaking views\" \u2013 for those who can afford them. A busier, more vibrant housing market will be good news for many, but Harding says: \"For young families, every price increase means home ownership slips further out of reach.\"",

President An\u00edbal Cavaco Silva\u2019s recent insistence that the shaky government reach an agreement with the opposition Socialists to ensure the \u201cgovernability of the country\u201d has added to markets\u2019 concerns. (While the President has wide-reaching powers in theory, in practice he rarely intervenes.)</p> <p>The Socialists are against the Government\u2019s austerity plans and have called for a renegotiation of Portugal\u2019s bail-out terms. The situation has forced Lisbon to delay the Troika\u2019s review of its progress, initially scheduled to start on Monday, until September and prompted 10-year bond yields to rise towards 8%.</p> <p>If Portugal does request another bail-out, there will be two key questions: will the German Parliament agree to provide more money with a general election imminent at home? And, if a bail-out is agreed, will the ECB then implement OMTs to match the hype that their announcement generated? There is a big risk that the answer to at least one of these questions is \u201cno\u201d, suggesting that a Portuguese debt restructuring remains a very real threat.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-51e01c07e4b092e250ab3810\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-07-12T15:08:58.943Z\">4.08pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">A tale of two bailout bond yields</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Back to Portugal now, where <strong>bond yields continue to rise</strong> on the back of the political crisis and Lisbon's related request to the troika of creditors to delay the next review of its progress on meeting bailout conditions. </p> <p>Portuguese 10-year yields are up 67 basis points on the day to 7.65%.

This would be the second of three pillars of the 'banking union' meant to galvanise the response to the euro zone crisis. </p> <p>....</p> <p>Schaeuble has long argued that an EU Treaty change is necessary before a resolution agency could get executive clout. He reiterated in the letter that Germany wanted a two-step approach to get there.</p> <p>The first stage should build on national resolution authorities taking coordinated decisions, with a board at the central level to \"ensure quick, effective and coherent decision-making\", Schaeuble wrote. </p> <p>\"This approach would not exclude the Commission. To the contrary, I advocate a decisive role for (the Commission) to rigorously apply the State Aid rules as minimum standards, and to protect taxpayers' interests,\" read the letter.</p> <p>Phase two would require a treaty revision and a more centralised solution, Schaeuble wrote.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-51dfebc8e4b019f8d7037ab9\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-07-12T11:43:11.033Z\">12.43pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Reactions to Portugal crisis</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Porutgal's main opposition Socialists are saying they want to renegotiate the terms of the country's bailout.</p> <p>Speaking in parliament, leader <strong>Antonio Jose Seguro</strong> says:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It is necessary to renegotiate our programme, to gain more time.</p> </blockquote> <p>Some reactions on Twitter to the latest developments in the country's political crisis:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/RobinBew/statuses/355597554907492353\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%23Portugal&amp;src=hash\">#Portugal</a> President intervention shows lack of confidence that Gov can deal with economic crisis.

The hiccup in global growth due to the slowdown in China and the rise in bond yields means that external demand for industrial goods may not strengthen much. Moreover, with fiscal policy set to remain tight in many eurozone countries, domestic demand is unlikely to rise sharply either. The best we can realistically hope for is that industrial production will be on a gradual upward trend over the next six to 12 months.

So at the close: \u2022 The FTSE 100 edged up 1.53 points or 0.02% to 6544.94 \u2022 Germany's Dax is up 0.66% at 8212.77 \u2022 France's Cac closed down 0.36% at 3855.09 \u2022 Italy's FTSE MIB was 1.57% lower at 15,430 \u2022 Spain's Ibex finished 2.32% down at 7844.7 \u2022 Portugal's PSI 20 fell 1.09% to 5364 while its 10 year yields are at 7.5% \u2022 The Athens market lost 0.9% to 804 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average edged down 7 points or 0.05% in early trading. On that note it's time to close for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, have a good weekend and we'll be back on Monday. Staying with Portugal, a last bit of analysis on the situation there, where to sum up main events: \u2022 Lisbon has asked the troika of international lenders for a delay to the next review of Portugal's bailout programme because of the political crisis. It was initially due to start on Monday, the request is for it to be moved to the end of August or early September \u2022 Bond yields have risen sharply \u2022 The opposition Socialists have demanded a renegotiation of Portugal's bailout terms \u2022 President Anibal Cavaco Silva has demanded (earlier this week) a cross-party agreement to last until the end of the bailout programme in June 2014 Jennifer McKeown at Capital Economics has this assessment of events: The risk of the Portuguese Government needing a second bail-out is growing by the day. President An\u00edbal Cavaco Silva\u2019s recent insistence that the shaky government reach an agreement with the opposition Socialists to ensure the \u201cgovernability of the country\u201d has added to markets\u2019 concerns. (While the President has wide-reaching powers in theory, in practice he rarely intervenes.) The Socialists are against the Government\u2019s austerity plans and have called for a renegotiation of Portugal\u2019s bail-out terms. The situation has forced Lisbon to delay the Troika\u2019s review of its progress, initially scheduled to start on Monday, until September and prompted 10-year bond yields to rise towards 8%. If Portugal does request another bail-out, there will be two key questions: will the German Parliament agree to provide more money with a general election imminent at home? And, if a bail-out is agreed, will the ECB then implement OMTs to match the hype that their announcement generated? There is a big risk that the answer to at least one of these questions is \u201cno\u201d, suggesting that a Portuguese debt restructuring remains a very real threat. Back to Portugal now, where bond yields continue to rise on the back of the political crisis and Lisbon's related request to the troika of creditors to delay the next review of its progress on meeting bailout conditions. Portuguese 10-year yields are up 67 basis points on the day to 7.65%. Irish yields, boosted by S&amp;P's upgrade to its outlook for Ireland's credit rating, are headed the other way. On 10-year bonds they are down 5 basis points to 3.9%. That leaves the spread between the two at 374 basis points. On the CDS market, plenty of drama too: A quick heads up for central bank followers who happen to be in London tomorrow that there will be a rare chance to see inside the Bank of England as part of the City of London festival. Tthe Bank and its Museum will be open to visitors on Saturday and museum staff will be conducting 30 minute guided tours of parts of the Bank. No word on whether new man Mark Carney will be staffing any festival cake stands... More now on that Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan consumer sentiment survey: The drop in the headline index to a weaker-than-expected 83.9 comes as the index on current economic situation rose to a six-year high of 99.7 but that was offset by a decline in the consumer expectations gauge. Consumer sentiment in the US this month is weaker than most economists had been expecting, according to the preliminary reading on the Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan consumer sentiment survey. The headline index came in at 83.9, confounding expectations for it to rise to 85 from June's 84.1. As Gavan Nolan at data specialists Markit says here, the political crisis in Portugal continues to move the credit markets. News that Lisbon has delayed a review from its international lenders has further shaken faith in the country's ability to meet fiscal targets and seen Portuguese government bonds underperform today. Yields on 10-year Portuguese bonds are a hefty 90 basis points higher at 7.9%. That contrasts with a drop of 7 basis points to 1.55% for 10-year Bunds. News now from Berlin, where Reuters has got hold of a letter from German finance minister Wolfgang Schaeuble telling the European Commission it is trying to have too much power with its proposals on how to salvage or shut failing eurozone banks. Reuters reports: Schaeuble wrote in his letter to Michel Barnier, Commissioner for Internal Market and Services, that the proposal for the Commission to make the final decision on whether to wind down banks was out of step with European Union law. \"The proposal published by the Commission regrettably envisages too high a degree of centralisation with regard to the boundaries of the existing (EU) law,\" reads the letter, which was seen by Reuters on Friday and is dated July 11. \"The proposal does not match the current legal, political and economic realities and would create major risks,\" Schaeuble wrote, adding that the transfer of powers to the Commission was not backed by EU treaties. The Commission on Wednesday presented plans for an agency to salvage or shut troubled banks, in which it would call the final shot. This would be the second of three pillars of the 'banking union' meant to galvanise the response to the euro zone crisis. .... Schaeuble has long argued that an EU Treaty change is necessary before a resolution agency could get executive clout. He reiterated in the letter that Germany wanted a two-step approach to get there. The first stage should build on national resolution authorities taking coordinated decisions, with a board at the central level to \"ensure quick, effective and coherent decision-making\", Schaeuble wrote. \"This approach would not exclude the Commission. To the contrary, I advocate a decisive role for (the Commission) to rigorously apply the State Aid rules as minimum standards, and to protect taxpayers' interests,\" read the letter. Phase two would require a treaty revision and a more centralised solution, Schaeuble wrote. Porutgal's main opposition Socialists are saying they want to renegotiate the terms of the country's bailout. Speaking in parliament, leader Antonio Jose Seguro says: It is necessary to renegotiate our programme, to gain more time. Some reactions on Twitter to the latest developments in the country's political crisis: A look ahead to the weekend briefly now, when China is due to report its latest GDP figures. Remarks from the country\u2019s finance minister have fuelled expectations they will show growth has slowed in recent months. Speaking in Washington, Lou Jiwei said growth could be 7% this year, the official Xinhua news agency reported. That would mean growth coming in below the government\u2019s official target for the first time in living memory. Lou said economic growth in the first half of the year would be \u201cslightly lower than 7.7%\u201d. \u201cThere is no doubt that China can achieve the growth target, though the 7 percent goal should not be considered as the bottom line,\u201d Xinhua reported in paraphrasing Lou\u2019s remarks. Economists polled by Reuters forecast second quarter GDP will post annual growth of 7.5%, down from 7.7% in the first quarter. Societe Generale is forecasting growth of 7.4% in the second quarter. Economist Wei Yao at Societe Generale comments: \u201cIndustrial production and fixed asset investment likely continued to decelerate in June as well. Retail sales growth may be the only exception, albeit just in nominal terms. In our view, the chance of upside surprises from the upcoming data release is fairly limited. Also we don\u2019t think policymakers will substantially ease their tough love stance in response to the data.\u201d More details on the situation in Portugal now where the political crisis continues and threatens to derail the country's smooth exit from its bailout next year. Reuters reports from Lisbon this morning that Prime Minister Pedro Passos Coelho says he is ready to overcome differences with his coalition partner and the opposition Socialists to resolve the crisis as requested by the country's president. The report continues: \"The president's words must be heard...let us reach a deal that matches everyone's wish, which is to conclude successfully the adjustment program by June 2014,\" he told parliament. \"The complexity of our situation forces all political agents, including the government, to cultivate democratic unity and political realism,\" the premier added. ... President Anibal Cavaco Silva threw the country into disarray this week by rejecting the premier's bid to heal the coalition rift via a cabinet reshuffle, lighting the fuse on what critics called a \"time bomb\" by calling for early elections next year. \"What happened should not have happened, and we have to show that it will not happen again,\" Passos Coelho said, adding that the government is still in office and fulfilling its duties. Socialist leader Antonio Jose Seguro also told parliament that his party is ready to contribute to solutions for the country, but reaffirmed it would not join the current center-right coalition government. \"The government's days are numbered,\" he said. In Portugal, government bonds are underperforming their equivalents throughout the rest of Europe after the bailed-out country asked to delay the next review by its international creditors. Yields on Portuguese two-year bonds are up 19 basis points at 5.96%, yields on 10-year bonds are up 12 basis points at 7.1%. In contrast, yields on 10-year Bunds in Germany are down 4.5 basis points at 1.57%. Following S&amp;P's comments on Ireland (reported here at 9.43am), yields on 10-year Irish bonds are down 13 basis points 3.83%. Martin van Vliet of ING says the drop in eurozone industrial production (covered here at 10.18am) \"confirms that the Eurozone economy is still struggling to return to growth.\" But he continues: Nonetheless, industry remains on track to make a positive contribution to Q2 GDP. Indeed, if industrial output were to remain unchanged in June, it would still expand by 0.9.% in Q2 as a whole, adding around 0.2 ppt to GDP growth. This, coupled with a weather-related rebound in construction in some Eurozone countries, may mean that a negative GDP reading could have been avoided. Looking ahead, the scope for further output recovery in the industrial sector in the remainder of this year appears limited. The hiccup in global growth due to the slowdown in China and the rise in bond yields means that external demand for industrial goods may not strengthen much. Moreover, with fiscal policy set to remain tight in many eurozone countries, domestic demand is unlikely to rise sharply either. The best we can realistically hope for is that industrial production will be on a gradual upward trend over the next six to 12 months. Against this backdrop, we suspect that ECB interest rates will indeed have to remain low for an extended period. Continuing this week's theme of calming market fears with words of comfort -- of the loose monetary policy kind -- another ECB official has been reassuring on rates. Speaking in Singapore, ECB cice-president Vitor Constancio said that with the eurozone likely to see an extended period of slow economic growth, ECB policy will have to stay loose for a long time. He also criticised the European Commission's proposal for shutting down failing banks, saying that the planned authority should be given access to a public credit line. The full text of his speech is here. Highlights include: Europe is behind the US in economic recovery and inflation risks which implies that monetary policy has to stay accommodative for a longer period of time. ... Advanced economies, Europe in particular, face a long period of slow growth that will test the quality of our institutions. The European social compact will have to prove its adaptability and resilience. The Euro Area is still facing a painful crisis of imbalances, financial fragmentation and low growth. Questions of excess inequalities and high unemployment will have to be addressed. ... As someone said, \u201ca crisis is a terrible thing to waste\u201d \u2013 and we are using this crisis to build a stronger and more stable monetary union that will play a constructive part in global rebalancing. Industrial output in the eurozone has come in largely as expected, slipping 0.3% in May from April. In annual terms, output fell 1.3%, according to data from Eurostat. There was some mildly positive news in revisions to previous data, with output now believed to have expanded 0.5% on the month in April, compared with a previous reading of 0.4%. Further details from Eurostat also bring some welcome cheer for Portugal, which tops the industrial growth league in May. Eurostat reports: Among the European Union member states for which data are available, industrial production fell in thirteen, rose in nine and remained stable in the UK. The largest decreases were registered in Romania (-10.7%), Lithuania (-6.3%) and Sweden (-3.8%), and the highest increases in Portugal (+6.1%), Latvia (+2.2%) and Estonia (+2.0%). Looking at the drivers of production throughout the eurozone, Eurostat says: In May 2013 compared with April 2013, production of durable consumer goods dropped by 2.3% in the euro area. Capital goods decreased by 1.5%. Energy rose by 0.1%. Intermediate goods grew by 0.4%. Non-durable consumer goods increased by 0.6%. Howard Archer, chief UK and European economist at IHS Global Insight thinks that despite the flat reading for construction output in May, the sector may well have boosted the overall economy in the second quarter. He send through this reaction to the UK data (covered here at 9.58am): It looks highly likely that construction output made a recently all-too rare positive contribution to GDP growth in the second quarter, thereby helping growth to strengthen and broaden from the first quarter when GDP rose 0.3% quarter-on-quarter. We currently estimate that GDP expanded 0.6% quarter-on-quarter in the second quarter. Indeed, even if construction output was only flat month-on-month in June, it would have still expanded by 2.2% quarter-on-quarter in the second quarter. This would translate into a positive contribution of 0.15 percentage point to quarter-on-quarter GDP. And latest survey evidence from the purchasing managers suggests that construction output expanded modestly in June. Britain's construction sector flatlined in May, according to official figures just out that will add a further note of caution to forecasts for overall growth to accelerate. The Office for National Statistics reports in its Output in the Construction Industry report for May - the first one to provide seasonally adjusted monthly figures - that there was no growth from April. The highlights are: The estimated monthly seasonally adjusted, total volume of construction output in May 2013 was 4.8% lower than in May 2012 Comparing the three months from March 2013 to May 2013 with the same three months a year earlier, the volume of construction output decreased by 4.8% Comparing May 2013 with April 2013, the seasonally adjusted total volume of construction output showed zero growth. There was a small increase in all new work of 0.3%, which was negated by a decline in repair &amp; maintenance output of 0.5%. More details on the move by credit ratings agency, Standard &amp; Poor's, to upgrade its outlook on Ireland's credit rating. The upgrade to \"positive\" from \"stable\" on Ireland's BBB-plus rating comes ahead of a planned year-end exit from its EU/IMF bailout. S&amp;P says in a statement: The outlook revision reflects our view that Ireland's general government debt burden is likely to decline more rapidly, as a percentage of GDP, than we had previously expected. Ireland's economic recovery is under way. S&amp;P said it saw a more than one-in-three probability it would raise Ireland's credit rating during the next two years, citing expectations that national debt will fall from 122% of GDP in 2013 to 112% by 2016. Reacting to the news, Philip O'Sullivan, chief economist at NCB Stockbrokers, said it will fuel expectations that Moody's, the only major rating agency that rates Irish sovereign debt as non- investment grade, will also take a more positive stance on Ireland. He told Reuters: When you look at some of the cliff-hangers we have had in the rest of the periphery, Ireland has kept its head down and got on with it and I think that has been recognised. What S&amp;P has done today illustrates the widening gap between the Moody's stance and how many others on the market view the country. We see a Moody's upgrade as a question of when, not if. While we are previewing data, there could be a further boost for US stocks today after Thursday's record highs if news there on consumer sentiment comes in as strongly as most economists expect. The main data awaited in the US today is the preliminary reading on the Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan consumer sentiment survey. The final reading for June at 84.1 points suggested sentiment was close to a six-year high set in May. The consensus forecast is for 85 today, according to a Reuters poll of economists. Capital Economics is forecasting a reading of 86 points. Economists at the thinktank say: Despite the drop back in some of the more timely consumer confidence indices in early July, we think there is some scope for the University of Michigan measure to rise a bit. After dropping by nearly 2% in the month of June as a whole, equity prices started to recover in early July. Gasoline prices began to trend downwards again, falling close to $3.60 a gallon. And the housing market is also progressing well, which we suspect may have started to play a bigger part in boosting consumers\u2019 moods. That said, labour market conditions are still improving only gradually and the more timely daily Gallup and monthly RBC measures of sentiment fell slightly in July. A quick preview now of the main data coming up shortly in the UK. Construction figures at 9.30am should give further fuel to the debate over what the economy did over the second quarter after the tepid growth of 0.3% in the first quarter. Official figures on Tuesday showed the manufacturing sector shrunk in May, bringing to an end the recent run of stronger-than-expected indicators on the UK. It was a timely reminder of the challenges that remain for the economy and cast doubt over some of the more punchy forecasts for GDP growth in the second quarter - some of which were as high as 0.8%. The construction data are erratic so analysts are reluctant to forecast further progress in May on April\u2019s brighter picture. That previous month\u2019s data showed the smallest annual fall - 1.1% - in well over a year, raising hopes construction may well have contributed to overall economic growth in the second quarter. Alan Clarke, economist at Scotiabank in London says today\u2019s construction numbers could \u201cruin the mood music\u201d on Britain\u2019s recovery: Construction output data is a random number generator at the best of times. That was incredibly robust in April, so it will be crucial to see if there was any payback in May. Even so, as things stand the least we should see for Q2 GDP is 0.5% q/q. Our base case is 0.75% q/q. After their tapering fears tantrum earlier in the month, stock markets soared the other way yesterday thanks to Ben Bernanke\u2019s latest remarks. His assurances that Federal Reserve help will be on hand for some time yet saw US stock markets reach new closing highs last night and that surge has boosted share indices around Europe in early trading. After the Fed pledged on Wednesday to keep interest rates low until unemployment falls nearer to levels last seen before the banking crash the Dow Jones industrial average and S&amp;P 500 index both rallied on Thursday to achieve at new record closes. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 169.26 points, or 1.1%, to 15,460.92. The S&amp;P 500 gained 22.4 points, or 1.4%, to 1,675.02 and the Nasdaq Composite added 57.55 points, or 1.6%, to 3,578.3. This morning, Germany\u2019s Dax is up 0.6% at 8205, France\u2019s CAC40 is up 0.3% at 3882 and the FTSE 100 in the UK is up 0.2% at 6557. Reuters reports that world stocks are heading for their best week in almost eight months -- MSCI\u2019s world stock index, which tracks markets in 45 countries, is on track for its best week since November. Michael Hewson, senior market analyst at CMC Markets UK comments: When Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke gave his post FOMC press conference in June he compared the Fed\u2019s intentions with respect to tapering to that of \u201ceasing up on the gas pedal as the car begins to pick up speed, not applying the brakes\u201d. The subsequent market response to that was to push up US bond yields, particularly at the long end of the yield curve, which caused a ripple through effect into the US economy, and in the process tightening up lending conditions. Mr Bernanke\u2019s response, at his speech on Wednesday, appears to have been the equivalent of a quick pump of the accelerator, pushing the said car back up to cruising speed and in the process we\u2019ve seen US markets close at their highest ever closing levels, and just shy of their previous all time highs, as US markets continue to outperform their European and global peers. These positive finishes look set to translate into another positive open for European markets this morning as we look to finish the third successive week in a row in positive territory, though China could be a cloud on the horizon after the finance minister suggested that growth could come in at 7% for this year, which is below the governments official forecast as well as a whole host of others. Good morning and welcome to our rolling coverage of the latest events across the eurozone, the financial markets, and the global economy. The main piece of news early on is an upgrade from ratings agency Standard &amp; Poor's to its outlook on Ireland's credit rating. It has bumped the outlook up to \"positive\" from \"stable\" on a view the Irish government may beat its fiscal targets and cut its debt faster than expected. Also coming up today (all UK times) we have: \u2022 UK construction output at 9.30am. The sector is only a small part - just shy of 7% - of the overall economy but this data series from the ONS is closely watched by economists trying to call UK growth. More to follow on that. \u2022 Eurozone industrial production data are due at 10.00am \u2022 In the US the latest University of Michigan consumer sentiment survey is out at 2.55pm and is expected to show a pick-up in optimism",

      "standfirst": "Shares lose 5% as US healthcare company says it will drop film version of Reckitt's heroin substitute", 
      "body": "<p><strong>Reckitt Benckiser</strong> is best known for its consumer products like Cillit Bang, but it also makes substantial profits from its pharmaceuticals business, notably its Suboxone heroin substitute.</p> <p>With its Suboxone tablets out of patent, Reckitt has been <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2012/oct/01/expert-questions-reckitt-benckiser-withdrawal-of-suboxone\" title=\"\">trying to encourage the use of its film version instead</a>, which is still protected from generic competition.</p> <p>But a US healthcare provider, CVS CareMark, has just announced it is dropping the film version of Suboxone from the list of medicines available under its insurance cover, prompting new fears about the treatment's future growth. The news sent Reckitt down 252p or 5% to \u00a346.77, making it the biggest faller in the FTSE 100 yesterday.</p> <p>Credit Suisse analyst Charlie Mills put a neutral rating on the company but cut his price target from \u00a349 to \u00a346.50. He said:</p> <blockquote> CVSC clearly appears to have decided that film and tablet are effectively the same product and so is steering its customers to the cheaper [generic] version...It is hard to see others won't follow suit (though we have no evidence this has happened yet). This opens the prospect of Reckitt losing not only the cash payers for Suboxone, but also a decent proportion of those on insurance plans as well. We estimate 15% of Suboxone users pay cash, 10% Medicaid, 70% third party insurance, 5% others. <br> How to model this is far from an exact science, but we will assume 50% of the insured patients are lost in 2014, along with all the cash buyers. This is materially worse than we had before, with a 5% cut to 2014 earnings, and 10% in 2015 (when all insured patients are lost, leaving just Medicaid/others). We cut our valuation for Suboxone to \u00a31.1bn (was \u00a32.9bn). The [remainder of Reckitt] we believe is in better shape and trading well, but if Suboxone is only worth \u00a31.1bn then the implied PE on the rest is 20.5 times (2014), and is beginning to look rather fully valued. </blockquote> <p>Overall, with further comments from US Federal Reserve chairman Ben Bernanke playing down fears of an early end to its bond buying programme, markets recorded another positive week. There was a touch of caution yesterday as Chinese officials hinted at lower than expected economic growth, while in the eurozone Portugal's continuing political crisis sent its bond yields sharply higher.</p> <p>Michael Hewson, senior market analyst at CMC Markets, said:</p> <blockquote> It would appear that comments from the Chinese finance minister that the world's second biggest economy could well miss its growth target for this year have taken some of the edge off the exuberance of the last two days though core European equity markets continue to remain underpinned on the prospects for continued central bank support from the Federal Reserve. <br> Southern Europe has been another story entirely with Portuguese markets getting hit on political uncertainty there, and the Spanish IBEX being hit by talk of a new energy bill which will raise prices to consumers as a part of electricity sector reform with the government slashing subsidies on renewables. </blockquote> <p>So the <strong>FTSE 100</strong> finished at 6544.94, up just 1.53 points on the day but almost 170 points ahead over the week.</p> <p>Banks were in the spotlight, with growing talk that a sale of shares in <strong>Lloyds Banking Group</strong> could happen sooner rather than later.</p> <p>At the start of the week Singapore sovereign wealth fund Temasek and a consortium of institutional investors were both said to have approached the UK government about buying part of its stake in Lloyds.</p> <p>Then came reports that up to 5% of Lloyds' shares - worth up to \u00a35bn - could be sold to institutions in September, a few weeks after its interim results. This would be following by a sale of another chunk of the government's stake to retail investors. Gary Greenwood at Shore Capital said:</p> <blockquote> [Selling shares to the public] may be politically astute but could be difficult to execute, in our view. However, whatever the ultimate outcome is, we think the government will be careful to ensure that an initial share sale is structured to avoid any potential overhang, thus damaging the prospect for future sales. <br> We believe news of a planned share sale could coincide with or come soon after the company announces its interim results on 1 August. We expect these results to have an upbeat tone given the recently strengthened capital position of Lloyds (following a series of asset disposals) and given the improving outlook for the UK economy and housing market.

      "bodyText": "Reckitt Benckiser is best known for its consumer products like Cillit Bang, but it also makes substantial profits from its pharmaceuticals business, notably its Suboxone heroin substitute. With its Suboxone tablets out of patent, Reckitt has been trying to encourage the use of its film version instead, which is still protected from generic competition. But a US healthcare provider, CVS CareMark, has just announced it is dropping the film version of Suboxone from the list of medicines available under its insurance cover, prompting new fears about the treatment's future growth. The news sent Reckitt down 252p or 5% to \u00a346.77, making it the biggest faller in the FTSE 100 yesterday. Credit Suisse analyst Charlie Mills put a neutral rating on the company but cut his price target from \u00a349 to \u00a346.50. He said: CVSC clearly appears to have decided that film and tablet are effectively the same product and so is steering its customers to the cheaper [generic] version...It is hard to see others won't follow suit (though we have no evidence this has happened yet). This opens the prospect of Reckitt losing not only the cash payers for Suboxone, but also a decent proportion of those on insurance plans as well. We estimate 15% of Suboxone users pay cash, 10% Medicaid, 70% third party insurance, 5% others. How to model this is far from an exact science, but we will assume 50% of the insured patients are lost in 2014, along with all the cash buyers. This is materially worse than we had before, with a 5% cut to 2014 earnings, and 10% in 2015 (when all insured patients are lost, leaving just Medicaid/others). We cut our valuation for Suboxone to \u00a31.1bn (was \u00a32.9bn). The [remainder of Reckitt] we believe is in better shape and trading well, but if Suboxone is only worth \u00a31.1bn then the implied PE on the rest is 20.5 times (2014), and is beginning to look rather fully valued. Overall, with further comments from US Federal Reserve chairman Ben Bernanke playing down fears of an early end to its bond buying programme, markets recorded another positive week. There was a touch of caution yesterday as Chinese officials hinted at lower than expected economic growth, while in the eurozone Portugal's continuing political crisis sent its bond yields sharply higher. Michael Hewson, senior market analyst at CMC Markets, said: It would appear that comments from the Chinese finance minister that the world's second biggest economy could well miss its growth target for this year have taken some of the edge off the exuberance of the last two days though core European equity markets continue to remain underpinned on the prospects for continued central bank support from the Federal Reserve. Southern Europe has been another story entirely with Portuguese markets getting hit on political uncertainty there, and the Spanish IBEX being hit by talk of a new energy bill which will raise prices to consumers as a part of electricity sector reform with the government slashing subsidies on renewables. So the FTSE 100 finished at 6544.94, up just 1.53 points on the day but almost 170 points ahead over the week. Banks were in the spotlight, with growing talk that a sale of shares in Lloyds Banking Group could happen sooner rather than later. At the start of the week Singapore sovereign wealth fund Temasek and a consortium of institutional investors were both said to have approached the UK government about buying part of its stake in Lloyds. Then came reports that up to 5% of Lloyds' shares - worth up to \u00a35bn - could be sold to institutions in September, a few weeks after its interim results. This would be following by a sale of another chunk of the government's stake to retail investors. Gary Greenwood at Shore Capital said: [Selling shares to the public] may be politically astute but could be difficult to execute, in our view. However, whatever the ultimate outcome is, we think the government will be careful to ensure that an initial share sale is structured to avoid any potential overhang, thus damaging the prospect for future sales. We believe news of a planned share sale could coincide with or come soon after the company announces its interim results on 1 August. We expect these results to have an upbeat tone given the recently strengthened capital position of Lloyds (following a series of asset disposals) and given the improving outlook for the UK economy and housing market. We also expect firmer guidance on plans to resume dividend payments to ordinary shareholders, with our forecasts now assuming a 1.5p final dividend will be proposed this year. Lloyds closed 1.48p higher at 67.73p while the other taxpayer controlled bank, Royal Bank of Scotland, rose 0.4p to 304.4p. Insurer Resolution climbed 10.5p to 318.5p after Nomura raised its rating from reduce to neutral and its target price from 250p to 311p, while ITV added 3.9p to 157.9p as Exane BNP Paribas put an outperform rating on the broadcaster with a 170p target. But with talk of a Chinese slowdown, the week's revival in commodity companies went into reverse yesterday. Mexican silver miner Fresnillo fell 37p to 981p while Anglo American dropped 42.5p to 1294.5p. Experian dipped 16p to \u00a311.83 on profit taking after the credit data specialist said it was on track to meet its growth targets for the year. British American Tobacco and Imperial Tobacco failed to benefit from yesterday's news that the government had postponed plans to introduce plain packaging for cigarettes. Instead investors noted reports the companies could be interested in a possible bid for cigar and snuff specialist Swedish Match, as they seek expansion to make up for a declining market for traditional cigarettes. Another competitive threat comes from electronic cigarettes, which vaporise nicotine to give users their fix without smoke or carcinogenic risks. Earlier in the week Canaccord Genuity said e-cigarettes would be the most significant development in the history of the tobacco industry: We estimate the e-cigarette market will grow from $2bn in 2012 to $3bn in 2013 (tobacco is approximately $700bn).

Invensys led the FTSE 250 risers following overnight news of a possible \u00a33.3bn or 505p a share offer from France's Schneider Electric, adding 67.9p to 508p. Finally, Oxford Instruments closed 120p higher at \u00a313.70 after a positive update from the technology group, which showed improving orders, sales and profits in the third month of the first quarter after a slow start to the year.

An initial venture will be a \u00a310m competition for businesses to come up with innovative, collaborative low-carbon vehicles, with winners potentially fast-tracked for commercial development through the centre. The government claimed the commitment would secure 30,000 jobs currently linked to producing engines. The industry expects traditional petrol or diesel engines to have disappeared by 2040. The business secretary joined car industry representatives to unveil the proposed research centre as part of a long-term industrial strategy, called Driving Success, which highlighted a shortage of engineers and other skilled workers that would need to be addressed if the UK industry was to continue growing. It also identified the potential to fill some gaps in the supply chain, with only a third of parts for cars produced in the UK being made domestically. Cable said: \"The UK automotive sector has been incredibly successful in recent times, with billions of pounds of investment and new jobs. This has been achieved by government and industry working together. \"With the next generation of vehicles set to be powered by radically different technologies we need to maintain this momentum and act now. Our industrial strategy will ensure we keep on working together to make our automotive industry a world leader.\" Cable's co-chair of the Automotive Council, the former Ford development supremo Prof Richard Parry-Jones, said that agreeing the new industrial strategy was \"critical to sustaining and growing a thriving UK automotive sector in a highly competitive global industry\". He said: \"Businesses prefer consistency, stability and a clear path to the future in order to make investment plans.\" Cable last month announced \u00a33m in funding for a new Automotive Investment Organisation, which seeks to persuade foreign firms to bring their operations to Britain. Around \u00a36bn has been invested in the UK car industry over the last two years, with vehicle production rising to 1.58m in 2012 against a background of slipping European figures. Although Ford is shutting plants here \u2013 at Southampton and Dagenham \u2013 the industry said it expected to recruit more than 7,600 apprentices and 1,700 graduates in the next five years. Mike Baunton, the interim chief executive of the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders, said: \"The motor industry is a major contributor to the UK economy and has been increasing that contribution in a challenging economic environment. \"I am confident that the strategy and the joint investment by government and the industry will make the UK an even more attractive place to design, build and sell automotive components and vehicles.\"",
