      "bodyText": "Major energy companies, banks and trading houses have stopped providing information to the price reporting agencies (PRAs) whose indices have underpinned the wholesale and in turn the retail gas market. The moves follows an investigation by the Guardian into alleged manipulation of energy trading, which has triggered an inquiry by the City and energy regulators. Officials at the Norwegian state-owned gas company, Statoil, plus several banks and two top Swiss-based commodity trading houses have told the Financial Times that they have ceased co-operating with three PRAs, Platts, Argus and Icis Heren. The PRAs were never accused of price manipulation themselves, but their reporting methods have been under question in both the UK and Europe. Fears were raised by an Icis Heren reporter and whistleblower, Seth Freedman, that unscrupulous traders could submit false data to the PRAs. Both trading irregularities and the PRAs' methodology are currently being looked at by regulators. Independent analysts told the FT that if major players declined to cooperate with the PRAs, then the price indices on which some multi-billion-pound contracts are based could be even more unreliable than they already are. Huge gyrations in reported prices on 28 September last year raised fears that it could represent market manipulation similar to Libor interest-rate rigging, a scandal that has undermined the financial markets and led to fines of \u00a3290m for Barclays and \u00a3390m for Royal Bank of Scotland. The prices reported by agencies such as ICIS form the basis for long-term contracts, and one explanation for the 28 September price movements is that traders stood to benefit by manipulating the benchmark price. In a letter responding to a consultation exercise launched by ICIS, published on its website last month, Statoil UK's regulatory affairs adviser, Shelley Rouse, said the current price reporting methodology should be amended to improve the transparency and reliability of the calculations and the pricing indices. \"We are concerned that the current methodology allows for the potential use of incorrectly reported trades to be factored into the index calculations, which can result in inaccurate prices being published,\" she wrote. \"Statoil would support the use of a daily weighted average of reported physical trades.

Centrica, the owner of British Gas, also expressed positive views about basing prices on deals done through exchanges rather than on the over-the-counter (OTC) market. ICIS, owned by Reed Business Systems, has now promised to set up an alternative system of price reporting based only on actual executed trades, which will run alongside its current system.

    "webTitle": "Coca-Cola says it will drive obesity battle with calorie counts", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Coca-Cola has announced plans to help tackle obesity by displaying the calorie counts of its fizzy drinks more visibly and promoting regular exercise. The measures, which will cover more than 200 countries, are part of the strategy of the world's most valuable brand' to improve its reputation among consumers amid concerns that its sugar-laden carbonated drinks are helping to fuel the global obesity epidemic. The Atlanta-based company is also ending advertising aimed at children under 12 around the world, a measure it implemented in the UK in 2009, and has pledged to offer low- or zero-calorie drinks in every country it operates in. \"We want to be part of the solution,\" Coca-Cola's chairman and chief executive, Muhtar Kent, said in an interview on CBS on Wednesday. He did not specify how the company might promote healthier life-styles, but said: \"We all know that taking in calories is more fun than spending calories and we want to make spending calories also a little bit of fun. \"We believe that this will begin to make a difference [and] create awareness around the importance of active, healthy, lifestyles.\" In a statement setting out the company's plans, Kent described obesity as \"a global societal problem\" and \"today's most challenging health issue, affecting nearly every family and community across the globe\". The move, which coincides with the 127th anniversary of the company, comes after Coca-Cola broadcast its first advert to mention obesity, earlier this year \u2013 which was believed the first in the history of food and beverage advertising to address the issue directly. Adverts were broadcast during the US Superbowl and during Coronation Street. Recent research suggested that sugary drinks caused people to put on weight irrespective of other behaviour. A decades-long study involving more than 33,000 Americans suggested that drinking sugary beverages interacted with genes that affected weight and enhanced a person's risk of obesity beyond factors of heredity. Tam Fry, spokesman for the National Obesity Forum, welcomed Coca-Cola's plans, particularly on calorie labelling, which he said was often unclear and confusing to consumers. Fry said the company had made significant improvements in the calorie content of its product line in recent years, by, for example, using a natural zero-calorie sweetener derived from the stevia plant instead of sugar. He said: \"It's Coke becoming more and more responsible because consumers are becoming more and more vociferous about health concerns. \"It's part of their philosophy that they're becoming more understanding of the problem of obesity and recognising that a lot of people put it down to carbonated drinks. \"[The drinks] were awful because they used to have only one high-sugar product but over the last 20 to 30 years they've been moving in the right direction and now have a number of low- and zero-calorie drinks, like Diet Coke and Coke Zero.\" Fry said it was difficult to demand the company ended production of standard red Coke \u2013 a 16-ounce bottle of which contains 210 calories \u2013 when it remained the backbone of its global business. But he said the company was partially responding to consumer trends in the UK that suggested lower calorie alternatives were the growing market. \"At the Olympic Games [Coca-Cola] did market research on the drinks people bought, which was taken on board by the company. Diet Coke, Coke Zero and water accounted for 73% of their sales, with red Coke only making up 23%.\" Coca-Cola sells all types of non-alcoholic drinks, from fizzy pop and sports beverages to tea, coffee, juice and energy drinks. About a quarter (800) of its products are described as low- or no-calorie drinks.",

Yes, yes, but what hurdles do chief executive Tim Steiner &amp; co have to clear to get the big bucks? \"The actual performance conditions are not disclosed due to their commercial sensitivity,\" the passage eventually confesses. What a nonsense. The arrangement is a charter for Ocado to draw up its own definition of success without outside scrutiny. Asking shareholders to signal their approval by a vote at Friday's annual meeting is a joke. Investors cannot know what they are sanctioning the board to do on their behalf. Both chairmen \u2013 the outgoing Lord Grade and incoming Sir Stuart Rose \u2013 should know better. The absurdity of the impenetrable long-term incentive plan will get lost amid the excitement around Ocado's supply agreement with Morrisons, due to be announced on Thursday, and a share price that has recently bounded back to 210p, above the flotation price of 180p. Well done, persistence may be about to gain its reward and the doubters may be confounded. But it's also time to stop taking outside shareholders for granted, even if Ocado is really only a semi-public company in ownership terms. As for banning the press from the meeting, come on, it's cruel to deprive Sir Stuart of a full audience.",

Yes, yes, but what hurdles do chief executive Tim Steiner &amp; co have to clear to get the big bucks?</p> <p>\"The actual performance conditions are not disclosed due to their commercial sensitivity,\" the passage eventually confesses.</p> <p>What a nonsense. The arrangement is a charter for Ocado to draw up its own definition of success without outside scrutiny. Asking shareholders to signal their approval by a vote at Friday's annual meeting is a joke. Investors cannot know what they are sanctioning the board to do on their behalf. Both chairmen \u2013 the outgoing Lord Grade and incoming Sir Stuart Rose \u2013 should know better.</p> <p>The absurdity of the impenetrable long-term incentive plan will get lost amid the excitement around Ocado's supply agreement with Morrisons, due to be announced on Thursday, and a share price that has recently bounded back to 210p, above the flotation price of 180p. Well done, persistence may be about to gain its reward and the doubters may be confounded.</p> <p>But it's also time to stop taking outside shareholders for granted, even if Ocado is really only a semi-public company in ownership terms. As for banning the press from the meeting, come on, it's cruel to deprive Sir Stuart of a full audience.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Marks &amp; Spencer is promising huge improvements to the way it serves online shoppers after opening a fully automated 900,000 sq ft warehouse in Castle Donington on Wednesday that will be able to handle 1m orders a day. The retailer, which sells just 15% of its clothing and homewares online, compared with about 35% at major rival Next, admitted that its current systems were ageing and inefficient. Laura Wade-Gery, director of multi-channel and e-commerce, said: \"E-commerce has become the cuckoo in the business nest. \"It has outgrown our business infrastructure. Our delivery proposition and availability is not as good as customers would like.\" Sales online have been increasing by 22%, but M&amp;S is still behind competitors partly because its website is run with Amazon, which has restricted the UK store's ability to sell overseas. M&amp;S has been building its own website, which will launch next year, and it hopes its new distribution centre in the Midlands will help ramp up sales. After more than 20 years of under-investment, M&amp;S is now aiming to launch a \"market-leading proposition\" in the way it delivers online purchases to shoppers, according to Wade-Gery. A first step will be an option, available within the next 12 months, to order goods late at night via its large stores for delivery the next day, before moving to same-day delivery. The new warehouse will help make that happen by cutting by 70% the time it takes to move products from UK ports to stores and improving the availability of popular items both in stores and online. The centre is currently handling just a few hundred orders a day, but by next year it will be dealing with 1m items daily, with 1,200 people working at the site during peak periods. Marc Bolland, the chief executive, said: \"We need to be agile and flexible as this world is changing.\" The company is in the middle of a \u00a31bn programme to improve ageing IT and distribution systems that began life in 2009. The changes will also reduce the amount of stock the company needs to hold by a third and help it to cut costs by using just three distribution centres rather than more than 50 warehouses at present. Analysts say M&amp;S faces a risky period over the next few years as it builds the Castle Donington facility to full capacity, adds clothing to an existing centre in Bradford, and sets up a new distribution centre in the south-east. The chain also has to urgently improveits clothing ranges as underlying sales of clothing and homewares have fallen for the last seven quarters. Bolland, said he was feeling \"confident\" ahead of M&amp;S's launch of its key autumm/winter clothing ranges to the fashion press next week. He denied that M&amp;S was losing key staff, despite the departure of Janie Schaffer, head of lingerie and beauty, after just three months in the business, and the exit of two other senior womenswear executives in recent weeks.

      "bodyText": "Time to stop, after a fairly slow-moving day, I'm afraid. Here's a closing summary. \u2022 Germany's economy may be recovering faster than thought after fresh industrial production data beat forecasts. The 1.2% jump in industrial output was hailed as a sign that Europe's largest economy would dodge recession (see 11.10am onwards) \u2022 There was further relief after China's trade data showed an increase in both imports and exports. Although some analysts questioned the figures, they were taken as a positive sign for the global economy (see 8.26am for the detail, and 10.44am for the concerns). \u2022 World stock markets kept climbing. Japan's Nikkei hit a five and a half-year high overnight, while Europe's markets finished at their highest levels since 2008. But some City analysts fear that a rally based on accomodative central banks will end in tears... (see 5.22pm) \u2022 The inquest into the Cyprus bailout continued. MEPs quizzed commissioner Olli Rehn and the ECB's J\u00f6rg Asmussen over the errors that led up to its rescue package. Both men tried to pin the blame on the failures of the Cyprus government, and argued that banking union and new resolution mechanisms would avoid a repeat (see 9.07am onwards) \u2022 The International Labour Organisation warned that the youth unemployment crisis is worsening. Those aged 15-25 are almost three times as likely to be jobless as older workers. (see 2.07pm) \u2022 Poland's central bank cut interest rates to a new record low. Norway, though, held borrowing costs unchanged (see 12.37pm onwards). Back tomorrow. Goodnight! During Jorg Asmussen's testimony at the European Parliament today, the ECB executive talked about how the much-criticised Troika won't be needed one day. I missed the key quotes, but Matina Stevis of the WSJ has filed a news story on it tonight. Here's a flavour: Europe should eventually put an end to the much-criticized \"troika\" of International Monetary Fund, European Commission and European Central Bank ad hoc teams managing the euro-zone bailouts, ECB executive-board member Joerg Asmussen said Wednesday. Future economic crises should be dealt with using the European Union's own institutions, he added, calling for a strong EU crisis-mechanism framework to handle future financial turmoil. Mr. Asmussen didn't mention the IMF as part of his vision for future European crisis-resolution. The IMF has participated in the troika from the start of the crisis and contributes money to the four euro-zone bailouts, although much less than the euro zone. \"The [troika] setup is a bit of a strange [one]\u2026decided in a crisis mood. So this has to be changed,\" Mr. Asmussen said. And here's the full story: Call to End Troika in Europe Crises. Keeping future bailout packages within the EU might calm some of the accusations that policies are being imposed undemocratically, and could also remove some of the tensions in negotiations. It's not going to happen anytime soon, though.... European stock markets have closed at their highest levels since before the collapse of Lehman Brothers in 2008. In Germany, the DAX has finished at a new record high, following its strong industrial production data. It was also helped by solid results from Deutsche Telekom, which hiked its profit forecasts. In the City, the FTSE 100 finished at levels not seen since December 2007, helping the wider FTSEurofirst300 index to a five-year high. But it's not hard to find analysts warning that the rally is built on shaky ground, with accomodative central banks underpinning share prices. Here's the closing prices: \u2022 FTSE 100: up 26 points at 6583, + 0.4% \u2022 German DAX: up 70 points at 8251, +0.8% \u2022 French CAC: up 35 points at 3956, + 0.9% \u2022 Spanish IBEX: up 53 points at 8597, + 0.6% \u2022 Italian FTSE MIB: up 133 points at 17255, + 0.78% Torben Kaaber, chief executive of Saxo Capital Markets, said the decent-looking (if dubious) Chinese trade data also pushed shares up. Kaaber, though, warns that the rally could soon unravel: As long as China keeps growing and the US keeps announcing positive corporate results, then Europe will continue to have oxygen pumped into its lungs. This is artificial strength, however. There are still too many bogeymen lurking under the European bed to believe that the upward trajectory of European indices, including the FTSE, is a sure sign of rude economic health. If you pump a 9 stone librarian full of steroids and get him to compete in the Sumo Wrestling World Championships, he may last for a short while but will still eventually, inevitably get squashed. We could be seeing a similar situation across European markets. The Omikron Project, a Greek group that aims to dispel stereotypes about their country, released a new video today starring Alex The Lazy Greek (who isn't lazy really). It uses official data to show that Greeks aren't actually the workshy, indulged characters you might see painted in the media sometimes: The figures seem to check out. One of Greece's biggest problems, though, is its relatively poor productivity. As Paul Krugman wrote almost a year ago, joining the euro actually masked that issus, until the crisis blew up. Fifteen years ago Greece was no paradise, but it wasn\u2019t in crisis either. Unemployment was high but not catastrophic, and the nation more or less paid its way on world markets, earning enough from exports, tourism, shipping and other sources to more or less pay for its imports. Then Greece joined the euro, and a terrible thing happened: people started believing that it was a safe place to invest. Foreign money poured into Greece, some but not all of it financing government deficits; the economy boomed; inflation rose; and Greece became increasingly uncompetitive. To be sure, the Greeks squandered much if not most of the money that came flooding in, but then so did everyone else who got caught up in the euro bubble. And then the bubble burst, at which point the fundamental flaws in the whole euro system became all too apparent. And as Krugman point out, America - a single currency region with full political union - can support areas of lower productivity without imposing tough fiscal programmes. Is fully opening up Europe's service market the key to the recovery? And should some countries stop waiting patiently for a deal on liberalisation, and strike their own deal? Open Europe, the think tank, believes it is, and they should. It released a new report today arguing that a fully liberalised EU services sector would boost European GDP by almost \u20ac300bn, or around 2.3%. Yet Europe still doesn't have a complete single market in services -- despite politicians such as David Cameron often lobbying for it at EU Summits. The solution could be for a smaller group of countries to 'go it alone' using the so-called \u2018enhanced cooperation\u2019 procedure, under which the Financial Transaction Tax is being implemented. As Open Europe\u2019s director Mats Persson put it: EU-mandated reform programmes are already being used to open up and liberalise the services sector in places such as Greece and Portugal so, logically, the very same reforms should happen at the EU level. Governments now have the chance to show they\u2019re committed to \u2018more Europe\u2019 in the area where it really matters \u2013 reigniting economic growth and boosting employment. And Dr Adam Marshall of the British Chambers of Commerce argues that countries with dominant service sectors are missing out because it's not as easy for them to do business across the EU as for manufacturers: The single market in services, which would benefit Britain, has barely started \u2013 in contrast to the single market in goods, which has benefited Germany for years now. And here's the full report: \u201cKick-starting growth: How to reignite the EU\u2019s services sector\u201d The eurozone downturn appears to be hitting fast-food giant McDonald's. It has reported a 2.4% drop in sales in Europe, it's biggest market, in April. A drop in demand in Continental Europe was blamed: Positive performance in the U.K. and Russia more than offset by Germany, France and other markets. That took the shine off a 0.7% rise in US sales last month, and helped to drag total sales down by 0.6%. In the Asia-Pacific region, sales were down 2.9% -- which it partly attributed to bird flu outbreaks. McDonald's chief executive Don Thompson warned that the company faces \"a persistently challenging macro environment\". Here's the official statement. The global youth unemployment situation is nearing danger point, an influential UN body warned today. The International Labour Office said that young people are nearly three times more likely to be out of work than older adults. And as the financial crisis has rumbled on, many are giving up on ever finding employment. The Lost Generation is becoming a predictably depressing reality -- In a new report, the ILO flaggged up that the global youth unemployment rate is rising again. The weakening of the global recovery in 2012 and 2013 has further aggravated the youth jobs crisis and the queues for available jobs have become longer and longer for some unfortunate jobseekers. So long, in fact, that many youth are giving up on the job search. The youth jobless rate was 11.5% in 2007. It peaked at 12.7% in 2009 before falling back, but has now climbed again to 12.6%. It is forecast to reach 12.8% by 2018. My colleague Katie Allen has the full story here: Young people 'almost three times more likely than adults' to be unemployed And the FT explains that This Time It's Different, in a bad way: In the past, youth unemployment has in some countries risen quickly during recession, but fallen quickly afterwards. This time, the length of the downturn is causing particular problems. In the majority of countries in the OECD club of mostly rich nations, one-third or more of young jobseekers have been unemployed for at least six months, up from a quarter in 2008 FT: UN warns global youth unemployment will continue to rise Missed this earlier -- Spain's prime minister, Mariano Rajoy, told the Madrid parliament this morning that the country was increasingly unlikely to need a bailout. Rajoy told MPs that his austerity measures and reforms -- deeply unpopular in Spain -- are starting to pay off. Associated Press has the details: Conservative Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy told Parliament on Wednesday that Spain was no longer close to a financial abyss and the threat of needing a bailout had receded. Rajoy said his policies were \"beginning to work,\" though he said much remained to be done. The premier claimed one major achievement was the sharp drop in recent months of the country's borrowing costs on bond markets. He said that could save the country up to 1 billion euros ($1.31 billion) this year. Spain's 10-year bonds are trading at a yield of around 4.1% today, indicating it can borrow much cheaper than last summer when yields topped 7%. But the real economy still looks dire -- with unemployment at 27% (and 54% for young people), and no hope of the recession ending soon. The central bank of Norway has resisted joining the ranks of the rate-cutters, and has just voted to leave interest rates unchanged. That rate cut means Poland's interest rates are now at a record low - as in the US, the eurozone, Japan, Australia, the UK... Just in - the central bank of Poland has cut interest rates by 25 basis points, becoming the latest county to ease monetary policy. This cuts the headline cost of borrowing in Poland to 3%, from 3.25%. Carsten Brzeski, ING's senior economist, reckons Germany is emerging from its winter contraction, when GDP shrank by 0.5% in the last three months of 2012. Commenting on Germany's strong industrial output data (see 11.10am onwards), Brzeski said: It looks as if the outlook for German industry is clearing slowly but surely... There's a lot of contradictory signs... but industrial production looks OK - we will get out of the contraction of the fourth quarter and though we're not accelerating as much as in 2010, we won't have a recession. One contradictory sign is the latest PMI data, which has shown Germany's private sector contracting slightly in April. Greg Smith, head of corporate dealing at foreign exchange company World First, is also cheered by today's data: It seems like the German juggernaut is still powering ahead, which will be a welcome boost for Merkel and the Eurozone in general. This news follows on from upbeat German factory orders yesterday and, coupled with stronger trade figures overnight from China, means that the global economy has had a good 24 hours or so \u2013 although we shouldn\u2019t get carried away as the underlying growth picture remains fragile. Germany's economy ministry was also upbeat about prospects in the manufacturing sector, saying improving order levels and a recovery in the construction industry should provide further impetus later this year. The Athens stock market has joined today's rally, rising by over 7% - driven by bank shares. Generally, though, the City is pretty quiet: European stock markets have climbed higher after Germany's industrial data was released, with its DAX index hitting a new record intraday high. \u2022 German DAX: up 48 points at 8230, + 0.6% \u2022 French CAC: up 27 points at 3948, + 0.7% \u2022 FTSE 100: up 15 points at 6573, + 0.24% \u2022 Spanish IBEX: up 40 points at 8584, + 0.47% \u2022 Italian FTSE MIB: up 90 points at 17213, + 0.5% Yusuf Heusen, sales trader at IG, suggests we're entering a phase where economic data comes in stronger but without the chance of monetary policy being tightened. For investors nothing could be sweeter, so it will take a fairly substantial chunk of bad news to disrupt the positive narrative. Germany's forecast-beating industrial output in March (see 11.10) was partly driven by a surge in energy use, which made up for a sharp drop in construction. Here's the details of the 1.2% rise in industrial output: Manufacturing output: +1.4%, of which: Intermediate goods: +0.6% Capital goods: +2.1% Consumer goods: +1.0% (durables: +2.2%; non-durables: 0.7%) Energy: +4.0 Construction: -3.1% German industrial output jumped last month, according to data just released which bolsters hopes that Europe's largest economy has avoided falling into recession. Industrial output rose by 1.2% month-on-month in March, rather better than consensus (of -0.1% on average, according to Reuters). The news follows yesterday's rise in German factory orders (+2.0%), It means German industrial output fose by 0.2% in the first three months of 2013, after a 2.6% drop in the last three months of 2012. An encouraging signal for German GDP. The euro swiftly rose half a cent against the US dollar, to $1.313. I mentioned earlier (opening post) that the strong Chinese trade data was being treated with suspicion by some analysts... ...well, Business Insider just helpfully posted a research note from Nomura, which argues that the figures are being artificially inflated as Chinese sellers are effectively 'over-charging' as a way of drawing extra capital into the country. Nomura analyst Zhiwei Zhang explained: We believe exports to destinations like Hong Kong, a major financial hub, are likely being over-invoiced in an attempt to circumvent capital controls and bring foreign capital into China. This view is supported by the recent SAFE announcement of capital flow controls on 5 May, which identified trade as a potential channel for unregulated capital flows. In the debt markets, Greece just sold \u20ac1.3bn of six-month bills, at an average yield of 4.2%. That's a drop on the 4.25% demanded by bond traders at the previous auction. Some reassurance for the Athens government, as it tries to attract new investment to Greece. Prime minister Antonis Samaras* will fly to China next week in the hope of drumming up new businesss Kathimerini has the latest: The government was buoyed by the news on Tuesday that German company Hochtief had sold its 26.7 percent stake in the management of Athens International Airport to a Canadian pension fund. Samaras is also keen to come back with trade agreements from China when he visits for five days later this month. The prime minister stepped up preparations for his trip on Tuesday, when he met with Development Minister Costis Hatzidakis. It is expected that as many as 60 Greek businessmen as well as representatives of the state privatization fund, TAIPED, will accompany Samaras on his visit between May 15 and 19. * - NOT Nicos Anastasiades as originally scribbled - thanks to kind readers for flagging up my error A few more key points from the Asmussen/Rehn hearing (see here onwards) Asmussen, who is Germany's man on the executive board of the European Central Bank, denies being influenced by domestic concerns during the Cyprus negotiations: Great question for the European Central Bank from Greek MEP Thodoros Skylakakis -- why did the ECB extend emergency loans to certain Cypriot banks, and allow them to increase their borrowing, in the run-up to the bailout request. Asmussen explains that Laiki Bank needed emergency liquidity assistance after it suffered large losses on its Greek bonds. The ECB reckoned that the ELA loan was a fair decision, as long as it believed that Laiki could be recapitalised. Yet.... the total ELA assistance came to upwards of \u20ac9bn -- or more than half Cyprus's annual economic output: Skylakakis wasn't happy with Asmussen's answer -- but at least someone's asking the key questions about how the Cyprus debacle occured: MEPs are pushing for answers on how the Cyprus rescue deal was so badly botched, but Rehn and Asmussen aren't taking the blame. Rehn argued that the Nicosia government froze in the face of the crisis: In Cyprus, and I speak with some experience of years of crisis management. We saw the usual pattern of a country in front of an impossible situation and leading to a programme. First there is a sense of denial, which leads to delays. Then there is a draining of funding. With Cyprus there was a loan from Russia which bought time, but was not used to implement structural reforms. And finally, the Cyprus people were hit with a \"very painful\" moment when its government finally asked for help. In other words -- 'don't blame us, blame the Cypriots\": Asmussen's full statement is online here. J\u00f6rg Asmussen says the lessons from the Cyprus financial crisis are that Europe needs to agree a banking union, and agree a European framework for the resolution of financial institutions Here's the key quote: This should include a clear set of commonly known ex ante rules for bail-in, buffers of \u2018bail-inable\u2019 assets and depositor preference. Regarding the latter, the new framework should place depositors at the top of the creditor hierarchy and ensure that the role of DGS in resolution is limited to insuring eligible depositors. This will contribute to reducing the risks to financial stability by providing legal certainty and predictability to resolution. Thirdly, a single resolution mechanism (SRM) should be set up. It would include a resolution fund which would allow a bank to access \"temporary, fiscally neutral, public funding\". EC commissioner Olli Rehn and J\u00f6rg Asmussen of the European Central Bank are now appearing at the European Parliament's Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs. It's being streamed live here. We're hoping to hear more details about how the Cyprus bailout was handled (and mishandled). Asmussen is explaining the ECB's approach to Cyprus, saying that the negotiations over its aid package dragged on too long, until the ECB had no choice but to withdraw its emergency liquidity assistance unless Cyprus's banks were restructured. He admits, too that Cyprus's banking sector is still not stabilised (with capital controls still in place). Olli Rehn also spoke, and told MEPs that the first tranche of the Cyprus bailout will be released soon. Rehn also claimed that the EU stood by the Cypriot people -- and stating that 'insured deposits' (below \u20ac100,000) must be protected in future. A sharp fall in Netherlands manufacturing production this morning has added to concerns over the Dutch economy. Manufacturing output fell 2% month-on-month in March, on a seasonally-adjusted basis (or 5.3% if you strip out seaonal variations). That's a nasty reversal on February's 0.5% expansion. The Dutch economy fell back into recession three months ago, as the eurozone financial crisis reached the Northern core. This doesn't offer much hope that it's returning to growth. Two top eurozone officials, Olli Rehn and J\u00f6rg Asmussen, will be answering questions about the Cyprus bailout in the European parliament this morning. Also coming up. we get German Industrial Production for March at 11am BST. And interest rate decisions from Norway (1pm BST) and Poland -- they could follow recent trends and cut the cost of borrowing. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the latest events in the eurozone and across the global economy. The share rally underpined by the world's accomodative central banks continues. Asian stock markets have rallied again overnight, with Japan's Nikkei closing at a new five-year high. The latest flurry of optimism was sparked by surprisingly strong trade data from China in the early hours of the morning. It posted a 14.7% year-on-year rise in exports, and a 16.8% jump in imports, which eased fears about both the strength of its economy, and global demand generally (although some economists were rather sniffy about the accuracy of the data, as China's exports don't actually match the import data from its Asian partners - details here). With many central banks poised to ease monetary policy if needed, the financial markets seem happy to cheer the good news, while ignoring the bad. \u2022 Japan's Nikkei, up 105 points at 14285, + 0.74% \u2022 Hong Kong Hang Seng, up 152 points at 23199, + 0.66% This followed another upbeat day on Wall Street, where the Dow Jones closed above the 15,000 mark for the first time. As Michael Hewson of CMC Markets put it: With central banks across the globe in full blown easing mode what could possibly go wrong? Poor economic data is shrugged off as an irrelevance, note the indifferent reaction to the ugly French manufacturing data yesterday, while positive economic data like yesterday\u2019s much better than expected German factory orders data for March; helps make the case for some form of economic turnaround. And in Europe the main stock markets are inching higher, in more cautious mood after the German DAX hit a record high yesterday. But while the financial markets remain upbeat, the real European economy remains troubled. And in the UK, we'll be watching out for the IMF. Officials from the International Monetary Fund are arriving for the start of their annual assessment of the British economy. This could see another front opening up in the ongoing battle between those favouring a fresh economic stimulus and those committed to fiscal consolidation -- though the clash will be fought behind the closed doors of the Treasury in the coming days. As usual I'll be tracking events across the eurozone and beyond through the day...",

Credit Suisse said: The FT has reported this morning that Qatar has sounded out IAG about acquiring Bankia's 12% stake in the company. An initial approach was reportedly made in 2012. We note that Qatar Airways chief executive Akbar Al Baker has previously denied interest in acquiring Bankia's stake. Qatar Holding owns 20% of Heathrow airport with Al Baker one of its two board representatives. Qatar has been repeatedly linked with acquiring Bankia's 12% stake, and this would not come as a surprise following Qatar Airways' decision last year to join IAG's oneworld alliance. An investment by Qatar would likely prove a positive for IAG, given Qatar's firepower to invest in partners and infrastructure to enhance the quality of IAG's global offering. However, we highlight that EU foreign ownership restrictions (49%) would limit the scope for Qatar to provide capital directly to IAG. We re-iterate that in our view the primary benefits of Qatar Airways joining oneworld include providing onward feed to IAG customers via Doha to markets including India/Australia (albeit via low-yielding double-connections), and potential reciprocal feed for IAG to the US or LatAm.",
