      "bodyText": "They are like great beasts: eight 12-metre-long machines with needle teeth that gnash away, spewing out a dozen mustard-yellow sweater sleeves or sides at a time. These 50-year-old knitting machines at Hawick Knitwear in the Scottish Borders may look like they are from the Victorian era, but are computer-controlled and as ruthlessly efficient as the hi-tech German computerised machines next door, which hum softly as they produce complex-patterned knitwear. Both are spectacular evidence of the survival of the UK's textile industry against the odds, as they turn out high-quality and highly desirable Scottish-made cashmere sweaters that sell for hundreds of pounds around the world. Hawick Knitwear, a private British-owned company that was once part of the Lyle &amp; Scott knitwear firm founded in 1874, is one of the survivors of a cashmere industry in the town of the same name that once employed 4,000 people in some 30 factories turning out more than 100,000 sweaters a week. Today eight knitting houses remain in the town, employing just over 1,000 workers \u2013 and the industry encapsulates both the challenges and opportunities for British manufacturers. Recently, there have been signs of revival as interest has risen in quality British-made products with a strong heritage. The fashion house Chanel bought the struggling Barrie brand and factory in Hawick in 2012, while the town's Peter Scott brand and mill was rescued by the Korean firm Gloverall after going bust in 2010. Survivors such as Hawick Knitwear are keen to join George Osborne's longed-for \"march of the makers\" and now the company is turning to a new TV business adviser. It is one of three companies to feature in a revival of the 1990s TV hit Troubleshooter. The show, which attracted 3 million viewers at the height of its popularity, was the first programme to turn business into prime-time, must-see TV, well before Lord Sugar's The Apprentice reached our screens. And it made the kipper-tied former boss of ICI, Sir John Harvey-Jones \u2013 the show's troubleshooter \u2013 an unlikely TV star as he toured the country, hair awry, giving hard-nosed advice to struggling businesses. This time around, it is the former CBI boss Lord (Digby) Jones doling out the advice, and he's determined to be more Sir John than Siralan. \"I'm not in a Rolls-Royce screaming 'you're fired' at people,\" Jones says. He says he took part in the programme to build awareness of the possibilities for British manufacturing in a world where technology is making labour costs less important than the ability to ensure top quality. \"If I hear once more that we don't make things any more, I will go pop,\" he says. \"Half of any Airbus is made in Britain and we make so many motor cars. Jaguar Land Rover can sell every car they make. Their export story has been achieved by not trying to build the cheapest but trying to build the best.\" Jones spent months working with three firms, including Hawick Knitwear and Hereford Furniture, to come up with ideas for what they could do differently before making his recommendations. \"I think in all three companies I was a force for good \u2026 a force for change by making them look in the mirror and analyse what they were doing.\" But, just as Harvey-Jones found two decades ago, Jones is not convinced the companies will take his advice. Hawick Knitwear's co-owner and managing director, Benny Hartop, says Jones may not have spotted anything the company had not already discussed, but he has prompted it to reorder priorities. \"He said to us, you need to focus on China and I think he has probably brought forward our plans there by about 18 months. But the UK is still our No 1 market and there is a huge amount of untapped potential there.\" The firm has won new orders from customers including Marks &amp; Spencer, which buys its Best of British cashmere sweaters from Hawick, but Hartop is not looking for soaraway sales growth. Although his machinery could knit far more sweaters every week, he says it is almost impossible to find staff who have the skills to link up knitted sleeves to shoulders without dropping a stitch. Hartop has trained 30 apprentices in the past three years, and will train more, but doing so is expensive: it can take nine months to learn to do the fine work at speed. Hartop's strategy is to improve profitability rather than topline sales, by pushing Hawick Knitwear's own-brand product. \"All our sweaters are made in Scotland and finished by hand. Some heritage or imported brands are importing from low-cost countries but retailing for a premium and so they have a lot of margin to spend on marketing about how British they are. \"For us that's a potential lost sale but also that customer who has saved up and paid more for a product because they think it's made in Britain and going to be better quality can be disappointed and they're not going to look at British product again.\" Jones, the new Troubleshooter, agrees: \"Hawick is making something the world wants. The issue is: do they go backwards by standing still or forward by taking a few risks?\" In the firing line Sir John Harvey-Jones, the original Troubleshooter, visited a string of companies over five series of the programme between 1989 and the mid 1990s. Some of his \"victims\" took his advice and thrived. Some didn't \u2013 and still thrived. Winners Morgan Motor Company Possibly the best-remembered participant as the family-owned classic sportscar maker snubbed Harvey-Jones' advice to modernise, raise its prices and cut waiting lists \u2013 but it still went on to prosper. Founded in 1910, today the company employs 177 people in Malvern, Worcestershire, and continues to assembly all its cars by hand. It credited its appearance on the show with bringing in hundreds of orders. Today about 70% of its cars are sold abroad and it opened a showroom in China last year. Copella A fruit juice and farming business based in Boxford, Suffolk, was founded in the 1930s. Harvey-Jones advised the founding family to sell out to a bigger firm in order to expand. They followed his advice, selling to Taunton Cider, but remained involved and bought the company back in 1991. It was acquired by the soft-drink firm Tropicana five years later, which in turn was bought by PepsiCo. Churchill China The pottery firm in Stoke-on-Trent was criticised by Harvey-Jones for only having one person in charge of design. It followed much of his advice and now credits its strong design team and focus on quality for helping it thrive while rivals have collapsed. The company employs 400 people and is listed on the Aim market with a strong family shareholding. In 2013 sales rose 4% and pre-tax profit was up 24% as the market improved in the UK and exports grew strongly. Velden Engineering Sir John took a shine to the Bolton-based engineering company, buying one of its electric golf buggies for his daughter. He said it needed to replace outdated machinery and improve its marketing when he visited in 1995 and the firm agreed. The company, which is still owned by the Kitchen family, continues to thrive. Currently employing about 50 people and has expanded into new markets including parts for the electrical, nuclear, even food manufacturing industries. Its gone from barely breaking even to making between \u00a3700,000 and \u00a3300,000 in profits a year on sales of between \u00a36m and \u00a37m. Losers Tri-ang toys In the first episode of Troubleshooter, Harvey-Jones didn't mince his words, telling the company to \"change or die\". It didn't change \u2013 and went bust. Norton Motorcycles Harvey-Jones' advice to the business was that only its racing team was worth saving and that it should go into administration. The business duly went bust shortly after the 1992 programme and its assets were sold to a US company.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Get ready for the government's next sale of Royal Mail shares. Nothing has been announced, it should be said, but consider the facts. The government is free to sell all or part of the state's remaining 30% stake from 13 April when the six-month lock-up agreed at privatisation expires. And business secretary Vince Cable, who shoved 60% out of the door at 330p, still thinks the current share price of 550p is full of \"froth.\" Why wouldn't he sell the remainder? If 330p was \"value for money,\" which Cable bafflingly maintained this week in the face of a damning National Audit Office report, he must surely regard the market's current bid as too good to miss. This is not an idle debating point. Imagine if the government sits on its 30% and Royal Mail's shares drift lower over the course of this year to, say, 450p. Cable and Michael Fallon might then be able to say \"look, 330p wasn't quite so terrible, after all,\" but they would have to explain why they didn't grab 500p-plus when they had the chance. Cable and Fallon's new conundrum underlines the madness of selling 60% in a single job-lot last October. There was no need to sell so many. They could have sold in several stages, as is happening with the state's holding in Lloyds Banking Group, made their lives easier and protected taxpayers. Sympathy for the duo extends only this far: Royal Mail was tricky to value. The bears pointed to the risk of a strike and argued that the restructuring road would be long and difficult. But, in the week before final pricing, it was blindingly obvious that shares priced at 330p or below would fly. Demand was spectacularly strong. Royal Mail was offering a dividend yield of 6.1% and savvier City folk had worked out that the company's cash flows were likely to become a lot stronger still (note: almost all City analysts predict 20%-plus growth in dividends for each of the next three years). The so-called \"grey\" market price was pointing to a day-one price of 450p, which materialised. If privatisation itself was deemed too far advanced to be delayed, ministers should have done the next best thing \u2013 sold fewer than 600m shares. As the NAO report pointed out: \"The department could have retained 110m more shares, worth \u00a3363m at the offer price, while still achieving the policy objective of reducing the government's ownership to less than 50%.\" That detail is painful. Those 110m shares are now worth \u00a3605m, and the difference in value is a straightforward loss for the taxpayer. Ministers were naive in the first place to swallow the self-serving bluster from \"long-term\" investors \u2013 who turned out to be nothing of the sort \u2013 that 330p was a rich price. But then, when everybody could see that 330p was actually a lowball price, they compounded the error by selling the full allocation. That is the point to remember if, in coming weeks, the government does indeed sell the remaining 30%, or 300m shares, at a healthier price and then tries to declare a mini-triumph. Don't believe it for a minute: the privatisation rush cost taxpayers dearly. Bad timing for McIlwee's Tesco checkout Laurie McIlwee's departure from Tesco has been long rumoured, but the timing bodes ill. Announcing the departure of your finance director ten days before unveiling a critical set of full-year results smacks of a loss of corporate confidence. McIlwee's supposed sin \u2013 in the eyes of some in the City \u2013 is that he's a poor communicator. Really? In McIlwee's shoes, you might question the material you've been handed. For example, Tesco chief executive Philip Clarke initially said in 2012 that his \u00a31bn overhaul of the UK stores could be achieved while maintaining a 5.2% profit margin. This was taken as a firm goal because it came from the big boss. But Clarke retreated from 5.2% almost from the off. The final abandonment came this February only via Clarke's passing remark that \"the margin will be what the margin will be.\" No wonder investors were confused. There was another kerfuffle over Tesco's woes in continental Europe. The City's grumble was that the impending loss of market share should have been signalled more clearly. Frankly, though, Tesco's deterioration in eastern Europe has been so rapid that you can't blame the finance director for declining to guide grown-up fund managers through the thickets. In these circumstances, a strong chief executive would have backed his numbers man to the hilt. Maybe Clarke did so. But, if he did, it hasn't worked because McIlwee has quit anyway, which is hardly comforting. Or perhaps the rumours about a disagreement over strategy are correct. That would be worse: it would suggest deep divisions within Tesco Towers. Whatever the full story, Tesco looks increasingly like Marks &amp; Spencer in the early 2000s when a couple of decade of unbroken success came to a juddering halt. As at M&amp;S then, the lower Tesco's share price goes, the faster the revolving boardroom door spins. Cheap borrowing for Spain could be cold comfort Super Mario strikes again? Spain can now borrow more cheaply for five years than the US. The latest fall in bond yields across the eurozone is, in part, the handiwork of Mario Draghi, president of European Central Bank. By embracing a discussion about \"unconventional instruments\" \u2013 aka, quantitative easing \u2013 Draghi and the ECB appear to have taken eurozone countries' borrowing costs down another notch. Bond purists would object that comparing bond yields in different currencies is silly if you're not adjusting for inflation. Fair point. The eurozone faces the imminent threat of deflation; the US doesn't. Even so, the collapse in eurozone yields in the past 18 months has been spectacular. At the very least, it says investors no longer fear a break-up of the eurozone in its current form. But, as a House of Lords committee rightly warned this week, don't assume the eurozone storm has passed. Weak growth, massive differences in prosperity between states and \"destructively high\" unemployment remain. To that list, we should add the fact that Draghi is not actually doing anything. He's talking about the principle of unconventional measures, not adopting them, and may already have left it too late to avoid deflation. If so, those tumbling bond yields could yet go even lower. In a real deflationary bite, they would offer only cold comfort. Answers still needed from FCA Martin Wheatley, chief executive of the Financial Conduct Authority, should not be hounded out of office by aggrieved insurers, almost everybody seems to think. Why let a small incident, like an employee's cack-handed briefing of a newspaper that temporarily upset a few share prices, end a promising start at the new regulator? It's a point of view. Before joining the Wheatley-must-stay campaign, we need better answers than provided so far. The staggering part of the tale is that the FCA seemed unable to recognise price-sensitive information, or misinformation, when it was in plain view. That is meant to be part of its job. The Telegraph report of the FCA's inquiry into zombie funds was published online at 10pm. It took 16 hours for the regulator to issue its \"clarification\", even though one must assume both the Treasury and the Bank of England were screaming at the FCA to address an obviously disorderly market. Cock-ups happen, but those long hours of silence are very hard to explain.",

Don't believe it for a minute: the privatisation rush cost taxpayers dearly.</p> <h2>Bad timing for McIlwee's Tesco checkout</h2> <p>Laurie McIlwee's departure from Tesco has been long rumoured, but the timing bodes ill. Announcing the departure of your finance director ten days before unveiling a critical set of full-year results smacks of a loss of corporate confidence.</p> <p>McIlwee's supposed sin \u2013 in the eyes of some in the City \u2013 is that he's a poor communicator. Really? In McIlwee's shoes, you might question the material you've been handed.</p> <p>For example, Tesco chief executive Philip Clarke initially said in 2012 that his \u00a31bn overhaul of the UK stores could be achieved while maintaining a 5.2% profit margin.</p> <p>This was taken as a firm goal because it came from the big boss. But Clarke retreated from 5.2% almost from the off. The final abandonment came this February only via Clarke's passing remark that \"the margin will be what the margin will be.\" No wonder investors were confused.</p> <p>There was another kerfuffle over Tesco's woes in continental Europe. The City's grumble was that the impending loss of market share should have been signalled more clearly.</p> <p>Frankly, though, Tesco's deterioration in eastern Europe has been so rapid that you can't blame the finance director for declining to guide grown-up fund managers through the thickets.</p> <p>In these circumstances, a strong chief executive would have backed his numbers man to the hilt. Maybe Clarke did so. But, if he did, it hasn't worked because McIlwee has quit anyway, which is hardly comforting. Or perhaps the rumours about a disagreement over strategy are correct. That would be worse: it would suggest deep divisions within Tesco Towers.</p> <p>Whatever the full story, Tesco looks increasingly like Marks &amp; Spencer in the early 2000s when a couple of decade of unbroken success came to a juddering halt. As at M&amp;S then, the lower Tesco's share price goes, the faster the revolving boardroom door spins.</p> <h2>Cheap borrowing for Spain could be cold comfort</h2> <p>Super Mario strikes again? Spain can now borrow more cheaply for five years than the US. The latest fall in bond yields across the eurozone is, in part, the handiwork of Mario Draghi, president of European Central Bank. By embracing a discussion about \"unconventional instruments\" \u2013 aka, quantitative easing \u2013 Draghi and the ECB appear to have taken eurozone countries' borrowing costs down another notch.</p> <p>Bond purists would object that comparing bond yields in different currencies is silly if you're not adjusting for inflation. Fair point. The eurozone faces the imminent threat of deflation; the US doesn't.</p> <p>Even so, the collapse in eurozone yields in the past 18 months has been spectacular. At the very least, it says investors no longer fear a break-up of the eurozone in its current form.</p> <p>But, as a House of Lords committee rightly warned this week, don't assume the eurozone storm has passed. Weak growth, massive differences in prosperity between states and \"destructively high\" unemployment remain.</p> <p>To that list, we should add the fact that Draghi is not actually doing anything. He's talking about the principle of unconventional measures, not adopting them, and may already have left it too late to avoid deflation. If so, those tumbling bond yields could yet go even lower. In a real deflationary bite, they would offer only cold comfort.</p> <h2>Answers still needed from FCA</h2> <p>Martin Wheatley, chief executive of the Financial Conduct Authority, should not be hounded out of office by aggrieved insurers, almost everybody seems to think. Why let a small incident, like an employee's cack-handed briefing of a newspaper that temporarily upset a few share prices, end a promising start at the new regulator?</p> <p>It's a point of view. Before joining the Wheatley-must-stay campaign, we need better answers than provided so far. The staggering part of the tale is that the FCA seemed unable to recognise price-sensitive information, or misinformation, when it was in plain view. That is meant to be part of its job.</p> <p>The Telegraph report of the FCA's inquiry into zombie funds was published online at 10pm. It took 16 hours for the regulator to issue its \"clarification\", even though one must assume both the Treasury and the Bank of England were screaming at the FCA to address an obviously disorderly market. Cock-ups happen, but those long hours of silence are very hard to explain.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Helped by this week's hints from the European Central Bank that bond buying could be on the cards if inflation remains low, European markets have ended the week on a positive note. The rises came despite an early fall in US markets, after the slight miss in the non-farm payroll numbers. Overall the scores showed: \u2022 The FTSE 100 finished 46.41 points or 0.7% higher at 6695.55 \u2022 Germany's Dax rose 0.7% to 9695.77 \u2022 France's Cac climbed 0.79% to 4484.55 \u2022 Italy's FTSE MIB added 0.83% to 22,175.48 \u2022 Spain's Ibex ended 0.88% better at 10,677.2 But on Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently 50 points or 0.3% lower. And on that note it's time to close up for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, have a good weekend and we'll be back on Monday. Over to Greece where there are growing signs that the country could tap markets again \u2013 possibly as early as next week. Helena Smith reports : Athens is abuzz with the news that after almost four years of being locked out of them, Greece will once again foray into international markets with insiders talking about the process beginning possibly as early as Monday. With yields on benchmark 10-year Greek bonds at a four-year low, the coalition government wants to seize the moment. Throughout the day the hints have been coming through thick and fast. \u201cA cycle has closed. Now a new book is opening,\u201d the finance minister Yannis Stournaras told reporters as he emerged from talks with prime minister Antonis Samaras this morning. Although he refused to be drawn on when Athens would tap markets Stournaras referred to earlier statements he had made \u2013 regarding market conditions and the positive attitudes now prevailing among investors. \u201cThe global economy is encircling Greece and the Greek economy with great confidence, spreads are continuing to fall and this is a very significant development,\u201d he told reporters late Thursday. Finance ministry sources \u2013 and traders \u2013 have intimated that an announcement could be made as early as this evening when Greece expects a credit rating upgrade by Moody\u2019s. Bankers in Athens contacted by the Guardian confirmed that preparations had also begun with the government hiring international investment banks including JP Morgan and Goldman Sachs to mediate on its behalf. It is widely believed that the government will attempt to raise \u20ac2bn in a sale of five-year bonds . Setting the tone, deputy prime minister Evangelos Venizelos who heads the governing coalition\u2019s centre-left junior partner, Pasok, also highlighted the role of money markets in what he described as Greece\u2019s return to normality. \u201cThe return to markets is symbolic of the gradual return to normality,\u201d he also said after holding talks with prime minister Samaras earlier today. \u201cMarkets move with more speed and wit than political and institutional discussions because there is always the element of profit, of enterprise [in them]. It is very important that we have an answer from international markets to where the Greek economy is today. And the answer will be positive, encouraging and optimistic.\u201d Analysts agree that if Greece does return to markets it will mean the beginning of the end of the country\u2019s debt crisis. That story of the ECB modelling a \u20ac1trn bond buying programme looks like it is being played down by the central bank's vice president Vitor Constancio: Back in the UK and Tesco has confirmed earlier reports that Laurie McIlwee, its finance director, is stepping down from the supermarket group. Tesco said it was considering both external and internal applicants to replace him. He will stay in position \"to ensure a smoothe handover to his successor.\" The supermarket is due to report results shortly. The ECB has modeled the economic effects of buying up to \u20ac1trn in bonds as part of possible quantitative easing, according to a report in German newspaper Frankfurter Allgemeine. The speculation has pushed Bunds and treasuries higher. Here are the Reuters snaps: 04-Apr-2014 15:20 - ECB HAS MODELLED QE PROGRAMME INVOLVING 1 TRILLION EUROS OF SECURITIES PURCHASES SPREAD OVER ONE YEAR - FAZ NEWSPAPER 04-Apr-2014 15:21 - ECB MODELS SUGGEST 1 TRLN EURO ASSET PURCHASES WOULD RAISE INFLATION BY 0.2-0.8 PERCENTAGE POINTS - FAZ NEWSPAPER The Anglo Irish Bank trial continues, and Henry McDonald, Ireland Correspondent, has the latest: The daughter of Ireland's one time richest man Sean Quinn was the final person today to give evidence for the state against three Anglo Irish Bank executives. Aoife Quinn was the final witness the prosecution put forward in the case against the trio in Dublin's Central Criminal Court. Quinn told Court no.19 that although Anglo Irish Bank made a loan to her worth \u20ac10m in shares in the now busted and nationalised bank, no official from the financial institution had any direct dealings with her. She also said that she had no contact back in July 2008 with Morgan Stanley, the international investment bank which organised the loans for shares in the bank deal. Nor did Aoife Quinn have any discussions with Ireland's Financial Regulator or even a lawyer in connection with the loan. In court she accepted her signature was on documents in relation to the so called CfD loans (contracts for difference) which were essentially bets on the share price of the Anglo Irish Bank rising. She also denied having any knowledge of a parallel deal Anglo Irish Bank was concocting with a group of ten investors to buy shares in their bank \u201cI was not aware of the role of the so called Maple 10 in relation to unwinding the cfd position that my father Sean Quinn senior had built up in relation to Anglo Irish Bank,\u201d Quinn said. The three men on trial - Sean Fitzpatrick, William McAteer and Pat Whelan - deny charges that they unlawfully gave financial assistance to 16 individuals including members of the Quinn family. Sean Quinn, who gave evidence earlier in the trial, lost his business empire due to his continued borrowings from the bank. He was using the loans from Anglo Irish to shore up a global property portfolio which crashed when the world financial system went into meltdown. It is expected that what has been billed as the biggest trial in European financial criminal history will finish earlier than expected. The case could be completed before Easter. The trial continues. Back with the eurozone, and more about this week's meeting of the European Central Bank. Although the ECB kept its policy unchanged, president Mario Draghi indicated that quantitative easing, once thought to be outside the ECB's remit, could be on the table. Now in an interview with broadcaster CNBC, vice president Vitor Constancio said the meeting agreed asset purchases could be considered if inflation stayed below 1% but no details were discussed. He said: That was not the environment to do it. We will see how it goes...and if indeed we will have to use all those instruments [such as bond buying]. Our US finance and economics editor, Heidi Moore, points out that there are still around 10.5 million people officially unemployed in America. And although the 192,000 new jobs created in March is welcome, it's not enough to drag the labour market out of its malaise, she writes: Only around 192,000 Americans found new jobs in March, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Economists had expected a much higher number \u2013 200,000 to 225,000 new jobs \u2013 last month after the end of severe winter weather. The numbers seem to confirm Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen's observation last month that the elevated rate of joblessness shows that the economic recovery is \"far from complete\". Here's her full story: US adds 192,000 jobs in March as unemployment rate remains at 6.7% And with that, I'm handing over to Nick Fletcher - cheers guys, and have a great weekend. GW A couple of views on the rally in Spanish and Italian sovereign debt: The main US jobs indices are inching higher in early trading, as Wall Street takes the jobs report in its stride. The Dow Jones industrial average is currently up just 15 points at 16587. Back in Europe, Italian government debt has strengthened to its highest level since the creation of the euro -- hours after Spanish borrowing costs (on five-year bonds) fell below the US equivalent (see earlier post). The prospect of the ECB launching quantitative easing, and weak inflation in Europe are helping to push money into 'peripheral' eurozone debt. You can rely on George Magnus, chief economist at UBS, for some pithy analysis: Rob Carnell of ING says the 192,000 increase in the non-farm payroll is a \"pretty decent figure\". He's not worried that the unemployment rate remained at 6.7%; with the participation rate rising, the labour force has swelled in recent months: He agrees that the Fed will keep trimming its bond-buying programme: With data like this, Fed chairman Yellen can continue to pursue her course of tapering, and remain comfortable that the Fed is not falling behind the curve in terms of continuing labour market slack. However, these data continue to point to ongoing improvements in the economy, and there is nothing here to suggest that the Fed is rushing things, if they do indeed raise rates for the first time in April 2015, as Yellen seemed to indicate at the last FOMC briefing. Just to clarify one point, while average hourly earnings were unchanged Americans did work more in March than February. The average working week rose by 0.2 hour in March to 34.5 hours, so take-home pay should have been a little higher. Randall Kroszner, a former member of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve, says the jobs report suggests that \"things are pretty much right on track\" for the Fed's forecasts. He is also concerned that average hourly earnings didn't rise in March, telling Bloomberg: We are seeing a drop in nominal income, and therefore a drop in real income. The Financial Times have dubbed it the 'Goldilocks' payroll -- with nothing to spook traders. US Treasury bills are rising alongside stock market futures, while the gold price has gained 1% to $1,300 per ounce. The FTSE 100 has pushed higher too, now up 0.5% on the day at 6683, a gain of 34 points. America has put last winter's blizzards behind it, according to data released with the non-farm payroll (highlights from 1.31pm) The number of respondents in the Labor Department's household survey who said they couldn't work because of the weather in March dropped back into line with the historical average for that month, flags up Capital Economics. Their chief economist, Paul Ashworth, says the only black spot in today's report is American firms' failure to raise hourly wages: The only disappointment is that after rising by 0.4% m/m in February, average hourly earnings were unchanged in March, pushing the annual growth rate back down to 2.1%, from 2.2%. Factoring in the jump in employment and hours worked, however, it's clear that household incomes enjoyed a solid gain last month. We also expect wage growth to accelerate later this year. Overall, now that the weather-related weakness is behind us, we anticipate that the monthly gains in payroll employment will remain close to the 200,000 mark, driving the unemployment rate gradually lower and allowing the Fed to continue winding down its monthly asset purchases. Wall Street is expected to open a little higher, when trading begins in 30 minutes time. The Dow Jones is being called up 55 points in the futures market, compared to just 17 points before the NFP hit the wires. Gautam Batra, investment strategist at Signia Wealth, reckons today's NFP report won't persuade the Federal Reserve to stop slowing its bond-buying stimulus programme \u201cThe falling unemployment rate remains frozen in its tracks at 6.7 percent, and payroll growth is hardly the strong data that forecasters expected. Nevertheless, as growth is materialising, albeit at a glacial pace, today\u2019s figures will not quell the Federal Reserve\u2019s tapering plans.\" But even with the revisions, the US economy has been adding just 177,000 new jobs per month in 2014, below the Federal Reserve's target of 200,000 new jobs. That suggests the US economy is still healing, as Joseph Brusuelas, senior economist at Bloomberg, tweets: US economist Justin Wolfers says the March jobs report, and the revisions to January and February, shows the US economy didn't stall in early 2014: Today's US jobs report is online here, at the Bureau of Labor Statistics: Here's a flavour: Professional and business services added 57,000 jobs in March, in line with its average monthly gain of 56,000 over the prior 12 months. Within the industry, employment increased in March in temporary help services (+29,000), in computer systems design and related services (+6,000), and in architectural and engineering services (+5,000). In March, health care added 19,000 jobs. Employment in ambulatory health care services rose by 20,000, with a gain of 9,000 jobs in home health care services. Nursing care facilities lost 5,000 jobs over the month. Job growth in health care averaged 17,000 per month over the prior 12 months. Employment in mining and logging rose in March (+7,000), with the bulk of the increase occurring in support activities for mining (+5,000). Over the prior 12 months, the mining and logging industry added an average of 3,000 jobs per month. Employment continued to trend up in March in food services and drinking places (+30,000). Over the past year, food services and drinking places has added 323,000 jobs. But at first glance, there are no real shocks. One disappointment -- US workers' pay rates did not go up. Average private sector earnings in March were $24.30 per hour, compared with $24.31 in February. The NFP report shows that the private sector workforce increased by 192,000 -- in other words, there were ZERO new government jobs created during in March. The US labour force participation rate is a little higher, up to 63.2% from 63.0% in February. That suggests more people were either in work, or looking for work, in March. So, a small miss. BUT importantly, the US labor department has revised up the readings for the previous two months. February's non-farm payroll has been revised upwards, to show 197,000 new jobs created that month, up from 175,000 initially. And January's reading has been hiked to 144,000, from 129,000 previously. Breaking: 192,000 new jobs were created in the American economy last month. The US Non-Farm Payroll also shows that the US unemployment rate was unchanged at 6.7%, the same as last month. More to follow...... Just 10 minutes until the US employment report is released. A reminder: we're expecting around 200,000 new jobs to have been created in March, pushing down the US unemployment rate to 6.6%. But the non-farm payroll (so called because it ignores the agriculture sector) is famously hard to predict -- economist forecasts are often wildly out. While protests take place in Brussels, there is a clean-up operation underway in Athens as the Greek government tried to make its capital look its best. With EU foreign ministers starting a two-day meeting today, workmen have been sprucing up Syntagma Square. Athens correspondent Helena Smith sends a photo: There's chat in the City that House of Fraser, the UK department store, has been sold to China's SanPower in a \u00a3450m deal My colleague Zoe Wood tweets a link to a photo that appears to show chairman Don McCarthy shaking hands on the deal: And the Daily Telegraph's Ashley Armstrong reports that the final touches are being made now. House of Fraser: Chinese tycoon agrees deal to buy 89pc An hour to go until the US jobs data. Eimear Daly, head of market analysis at Monex Europe, says today's non-farm payroll will show whether the recent \"soggy\" US economy is due to adverse winter weather, or shows \"a more chronic and deeply rooted problem\". She points out that job creation has slowed badly since November, behind the Federal Reserve's target. The effect of heavy snowfall and freezing temperatures had completely faded by the March reporting month, meaning a weak result can no longer be overlooked. \"In the first eleven months of 2013, jobs growth averaged 210,000, meeting the Fed\u2019s desired criteria of over 200,000. The US has added an average of 129,000 jobs a month since December, hardly the \u201congoing improvement\u201d in the labour market that the Fed claims. A demonstrator has been hurt at the Brussels protests, the WSJ's Matina Stevis reports: Update: it may be a man, not a woman: Back to those anti-austerity protests in Brussels (see 11.31am), and there are multiple reports of clashes between European unions and riot police. Journalists at the scene say tear gas and water cannons have been used, after the US embassy went into lock-down mode as crowds demonstrated outside. The tweets show pictures and video from the scene (you might need to refresh the page...) Christian Stocker, an equity strategist at UniCredit in Munich, also predicts a strong US jobs report today. He points to Thursday's strong ADP report, showing 191,000 new jobs were created in the US private sector. That means most people are expecting a \"better-than-expected\" non-farm payroll (I know that sounds daft, but most NFP forecasts were made earlier this week) Stocker told Reuters: \"After an encouraging ADP report this week, it\u2019s highly possible that the non-farm payrolls numbers will be very solid today.\" \"The market has mostly priced in a better-than-expected number, but a much stronger reading will trigger a rally...If the data shows that only about 200,000 jobs were added, then we could see a bout of profit-taking.\" European stock markets have pushed higher this morning, as investors anticipate a strong US employment report when the monthly Non-Farm Payroll is released in just under two hours. The consensus forecast in the City is that around 200,000 new jobs were created across the American economy last month, with the unemployment rate dropping from 6.7% to 6.6% Firms are expected to have hired more staff last month as the weather improved -- the bad US winter has been blamed for weak job creation in January and February. A really blow-out number, over 200,000, could show that the US recovery is gathering pace. Conversely, a weak reading will reignite worries of a slowdown. Yesterday, a survey of the US private sector showed firms hired staff at the fastest rate in three months in March, with February's reading also revised higher. Marc Ostwald of Monument Securities reckons there's more chance that the NFP will come in above the consensus forecast. There is no doubt that this month's US labour report marks something of watershed, primarily from the aspect that it will be free of weather effects. That optimism has sent the FTSE 100 up 26 points, or 0.4%, to 6676 after a fairly calm morning's trading. Most other indices are also higher. Heads-up: reporters in Brussels say they've currently locked down at the US embassy, while an anti-austerity protest takes place outside: Dan Quayle, the former US vice president, has helped take a major stake in the Northern Ireland property market. Quayle's private equity company, Cerberus Capital Management, has bought up a multi billion-dollar portfolio of loans secured on empty properties once owned by the brash builders and slick speculators from the Republic of Ireland's Celtic Tiger years. Henry McDonald, Ireland correspondent, has the details: Ireland's state-owned \"Bad Bank\", which took over the toxic, debt ridden assets of property speculators during the financial crash, has sold its portfolio of empty flats, houses and buildings in Northern Ireland, it was announced today. The National Assets Management Agency (NAMA) has off-loaded its entire stock of property across the border, valued at \u00a34.5bn, to Cerberus Capital Management. The New York-based investment firm will now take over the control of the assets which the Republic's \"bad bank\" used to own. According to reports, Cerberus paid around \u20ac1.3bn for the portfolio of loans. First Minister Peter Robinson, who is currently wrestling with his power sharing cabinet colleagues in Belfast over welfare reform, has welcomed the sale. Robinson said the disposal of the assets including high grade commercial properties in central Belfast would boost the overall property market in Northern Ireland. He said \"For some time I have made clear the danger to the local economy of leaving valuable assets undeveloped and the threat that these posed to otherwise profitable businesses. I believe that this deal can be of real benefit to our economy.\" The Democratic Unionist Party leader also thanked the Republic's government for selling off the portfolio. \"I am grateful to the authorities in the Republic for the way in which this transaction has been handled and the importance of assisting the Northern Ireland economy.\" Robinson revealed that he had spoken to Quayle, chairman of Cerberus Global Investments, yesterday to confirm the sale as well as NAMA's chairman in the south, Frank Daly. \"Dan Quayle offered to send a team to Belfast to meet with us to discuss the way forward and we intend to take him up on that offer. \"In the weeks to come the Northern Ireland Executive will work with Cerberus to ensure that the deal can help kick start growth in this area of our economy.\" Greek retail sales have taken another tumble, with turnover dropping by another 4.3% year-on-year in January. Elstat's data , released this morning, showed that sales volumes fell 21% in monthly terms, as shoppers cut back after Christmas. The data also illustrates the effects of deflation in Greece -- sales volumes (rather than turnover, which measures the value of the goods) were down 1.9% annually and 17% month-on-month. It reinforces the battered state of the Greek economy after years of recession and austerity. Analysts are now talking about the country returning to growth this year, but we shouldn't get carried away. Supermarkets sales were the biggest casualty, down over 8% year-on-year, while spending on books and stationary actually rose by 2.7%. Britain's car industry has just racked up its biggest month's sales in a decade, as consumers take advantage of cheap credit deals. More than 464,000 new cars were sold in March alone, a 17,7% jump on a year ago, and the biggest surge since 2004. Mike Hawes, SMMT Chief Executive, claims there's still untapped demand, after years of belt-tightening: \u201cThere has never been a better time to buy a new car thanks to attractive finance deals and advanced technologies that often make new cars cheaper to run. We expect the market to continue to perform positively for the rest of the year, albeit at a more modest rate.\u201d Demand for new 14-plate sees March reach 464,824 new car registrations, a rise of 17.7%. Since move to twice-yearly plate change in 1999, only March 2004 saw higher registrations (at 466,954). Year-to-date registrations up 13.7% to 688,122 units. March is typically biggest month in year accounting for almost a fifth of full-year registrations. Biggest-ever month for alternatively-fuelled vehicles as volumes reach 8,713 units, growth of 63.8% on 2013. The latest UK house price index from Halifax contains a surprise - it reckons prices actually fell last month. Halifax's survey shows a 1.1% drop in prices in March, compared to February, which may indicate that some heat came out of the market. However, on an annual basis prices jumped 8.7% in the first quarter of the year, the biggest rise since October 2007. If you'd declared two years ago that Spanish bond yields (interest rates) would be below the US equivalent today, you'd probably have been sent to a dark room to recover. But it happened, this morning. Spanish five-year bonds are trading at a yield of just 1.78% this morning, dropping below the 1.79% level at which US five-year Treasury bills are changing hands. This comes as traders continue to digest yesterday's European Central Bank meeting, where Mario Draghi revealed that the governing council had talked about the possibility of a quantitative easing programme (although the details are vague) The Turkish lira has taken a dive this morning after Recep Tayyip Erdogan declared that Turkey's central bank should hold an emergency meeting and cut interest rates. He said: [Bond] yields are falling. In line with this, the central bank will probably convene an extraordinary monetary policy committee meeting Just like it convened extraordinarily last time to hike rates, this time it should convene and lower interest rates. The Turkish PM's latest foray into monetary policy had a predictably weakening effect on the lira, knocking it to 2.1460 against the US dollar , from 2.1350 beforehand. Back in late January, the Turkish central bank defied Erdogan's wishes and hiked the headline rate to 12%, from 7.75% previously, in a bid to underpin the lira as the emerging market crisis bubbled up. They've been there ever since. Erdogan sounded in combative mood this morning. He also criticising the Turkish Constitutional Court for overturning his ban on Twitter this week, saying: \"We are of course bound by the Constitutional Court verdict, but I don't have to respect it. I don't respect this ruling,\" In the City, Royal Bank of Scotland has confirmed the rumours and announced that it has lured Credit Suisse senior investment banker Ewen Stevenson to be its next chief finance officer. Stevenson takes the hot seat in mid-May, as the state-owned bank continues with the gruelling task of cutting its balance sheet and refocusing on the UK. Stevenson's fellow New Zealander, CEO Ross McEwan, pointed out that RBS still has a lot of work to to \u201cAt RBS we are determined to re-earn the trust of our customers and our continued financial health is central to that task. Ewen shares our vision for building a great customer bank and I look forward to working with him.\u201d The 0.6% rise in German factory orders in February suggests growth in Europe\u2019s largest economy is gathering pace, with domestic demand cushioning weakness overseas. So reckons Christian Schulz, senior economist at Berenberg Bank in London, who said: \u201cThe emerging market turbulences and the cold winter in the US may have at least temporarily prevented further growth in export orders. \u201cDomestic demand and especially consumption are increasingly taking over the role of exports as growth locomotive. That insulates Germany a bit from troubles abroad and should continue to help the euro crisis countries via increased German imports.\u201d That's via Bloomberg. More here. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the financial markets, the world economy, the eurozone and business. And I should wish those of you in the markets a happy Non-Farm Payroll Day too. Later today (1.30pm BST) the latest American jobs report is announced, and traders are expecting a big jump in employment as the US economy picks up pace after the winter. But first up, the latest factory data from Germany has beaten expectations, with new orders rising by 0.6% in February. It was driven by a 1.2% jump in domestic demand, with orders from overseas inching up just 0.2%. That may be a welcome sign that Europe's largest economy is picking up, which could ultimately ripple out across the euro area. The German Economy Ministry sounds upbeat, declaring that: \"The data suggests industrial production will continue to revive in the coming months and momentum in domestic demand is picking up in the first quarter,\" Domestic orders for new capital equipment jumped by 1.4% in February, suggesting German factory owners are confident enough to buy new, expensive machinery. But capital equipment orders from overseas dipped by 0.2%, underlining that many other countries are in a more fragile state. And the figures aren't all rosy -- January's data have been revised down to show orders rose by just 0.1%, not the 1.2% first estimated. But still, this is the first time in almost a year that the notoriously volatile industrial orders have risen for two months in a row. ING's Carsten Brzeski reckons Germany's economy probably enjoyed a decent start to 2014. Otherwise, there's not too much afoot this morning. But I'll be tracking the main events -- including those eagerly awaited US jobs numbers....",

We had previously taken guidance (that Spring would be EBITDA break-even in year 3) at face value and implicitly assumed costs were temporary but guidance actually presupposes price increases to offset the costs - which we are reluctant to give credit for on this timeframe. As a result, we no longer assume a rebound in margins post Project Spring. Vodafone has given back its gains since the return of value [from the proceeds of the sale of its Verizon Wireless stake], but we do not see any rush to buy today given fundamental concerns, the likely introduction of prudent guidance from a new chief financial officer and scope for AT&amp;T to manage down expectations further in coming months. We would expect to revisit a more positive risk-reward opportunity in the early summer. FirstGroup fell 2.5p to 132p as Goldman Sachs reduced its recommendation from buy to neutral and Deutsche Bank cut its price target from 128p to 125p after this week's update from the bus and rail group. It said operating profits for the year would be \u00a314m lower than expected due to recent severe weather conditions, especially in the US which affected its First Student and Greyhound operations. Finally Cranswick, the pork and sausage company, added 8p to k\u00a312.77p ahead of a fourth quarter trading statement due on Monday. In a hold note Peel Hunt said: Margins should be continuing to improve, as pig prices have slipped back from a peak of 172p to 162p per kilo currently, and Cranswick secured price increases. The greater level of vertical integration (around 25% of pigs internally generated) means the company is now partially protected from movements in the pig price. The shares look fairy rated, given the relatively pedestrian growth and the likely step-up in pressure from the retailers.",

      "bodyText": "Tesco was facing fresh turmoil on Friday as the supermarket confirmed that Laurie McIlwee, its embattled finance director, has quit just days before the company is expected to announce a new decline in profits. In a statement released to the stock exchange Tesco said McIlwee had \"decided to step down from the board and resign from the company but has agreed to remain in his role to ensure a smooth handover to his successor\". He will leave the business once a replacement has been found and is likely to walk away with a pay-off of around \u00a31m to cover his one-year contract and potentially a larger sum to cover share options he has been awarded. McIlwee's departure comes after months of speculation about his future and amid reports of disagreements over strategy with chief executive Philip Clarke, who is trying to reverse shrinking sales and falling profitability at the supermarket chain. In February Tesco formally abandoned its profit margin target of 5.2% which, despite its recent problems, had remained the highest in the industry. That was followed by last month's industry data which showed its UK market share had shrunk to 28.7%, its lowest level in almost a decade. The pressure on McIlwee, who has worked at Tesco since 2000, has been growing before upcoming annual results on 16 April when analysts expect underlying profits to fall back to \u00a33bn from \u00a33.2bn \u2013 the second consecutive decline. Last year's fall was the first in a generation. In 2012 Tesco made \u00a33.8bn. McIlwee joined Tesco from PepsiCo in 2000 and was promoted to the board in 2009 when he took on the finance brief. He earns a basic salary of \u00a3863,000 and is likely to be entitled to a pay-off of one year's salary. During his tenure he has amassed a \u00a35.2m pension pot and been awarded 2.7m share options. \"I am proud of what we have achieved at Tesco over the last few years,\" said McIlwee in the statement. \"However, after 14 years at Tesco I feel that now is the right time for me to pursue new opportunities. I wish Philip and the team well and I am absolutely confident that Tesco will emerge from the current period of unprecedented change in the industry stronger than ever.\" Tesco said it had begun looking for a new chief financial officer and that both internal and external applicants would be considered. Its chairman Richard Broadbent said: \"Together with Philip and the wider team, Laurie has played an important role in our process to transform Tesco and position it to be a winner in the new era of retailing. I and the board wish him every success for the future.\" Insiders played down reports of a bust up over strategy between the two men but conceded McIlwee had had a difficult relationship with some analysts. Headhunters are yet to be appointed but it is thought that investors would welcome the appointment of an external candidate.",

      "bodyText": "Shell has been accused by the US Coast Guard of ignoring safety warnings and moving one of its drill ships in the US Arctic, partly in a bid to avoid paying extra taxes. The damning allegation is contained in an official 152-page report by the US Coast Guard into how the Anglo-Dutch oil group came to allow the Kulluk to run aground in December 2012. Shell has recently been forced to shelve any plans to drill in the Beaufort Sea again this summer after a federal appeal court ruled the US authorities had failed to properly consider the potential risks. One senior US politician said Shell should be punished for its \"reckless\" behaviour and the report raised \"major red flags\" over any future oil and gas exploration in the pristine waters of the far north. The US Coast Guard report said Shell's plans \"were not adequate for the winter towing operation across the Gulf of Alaska\" while arguing that a potential tax penalty influenced the decision to set sail in stormy weather. The Kulluk was in danger of being subjected to new Alaskan taxes if it stayed in local waters beyond the end of December.

Sanpower, which is controlled by one of China's richest men, Yuan Yafei, owns China's oldest department store, Nanjing Xinjiekou. The deal puts paid to plans to list House of Fraser on the London stock exchange with Sanpower inking a deal to buy a 89% stake. House of Fraser, which traces its roots back to a small Glasgow drapery shop opened by Hugh Fraser and James Arthur in 1849, has been in play for several years but earlier talks with France's Galeries Lafayette and the Sports Direct founder, Mike Ashley, came to nothing. In recent months a listing had looked increasingly likely with the negotiations with Sanpower run as a parallel process.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "New car sales leapt in March to record their biggest month in a decade, fuelled by demand for the new 14 registration plate. The Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders said new car registrations, a proxy for sales, rose 17.7% to 464,824 last month. Since the move to twice-yearly plate changes in 1999, only March 2004 saw higher registrations, of 466,954. The society's chief executive, Mike Hawes, said the surge in sales reflected \"intensifying consumer confidence and the availability of great new products\". He added: \"Given the past six years of subdued economic performance across the UK, there is still a substantial margin of pent-up demand that is contributing to a strong new and used car market. We expect the market to continue to perform positively for the rest of the year, albeit at a more modest rate.\" Sales for the first three months of 2014 stood at 688,122, up 13.7% from the same period last year. March is typically the biggest month of the year and accounts for nearly a fifth of annual registrations. It was the biggest-ever month for alternatively fuelled cars as sales reached 8,713, up 63.8% on a year ago. Howard Archer, the chief UK and European economist at IHS Global Insight, described the figures as \"extremely good news for the car industry and a significant boost to first-quarter growth prospects for the overall economy\". The biggest seller was once again the Ford Fiesta, which sold 25,753 cars in March, followed by the Ford Focus with 16,860 and the Vauxhall Corsa with 16,231. White was the most popular car colour, compared with silver a decade ago. Separately, Bentley Motors said global deliveries to customers rose by 17% to 2,580 cars in the first quarter of this year from a year earlier. There was growth in every region, with the US cementing its number one position, and double digit growth in the Middle East, China and Europe. New models including the 206 mph (331 km/h) Continental GT Speed coupe and the Flying Spur V8 luxury sedan, unveiled at last month's Geneva motor show, should boost sales in coming months.",

According to the Betaville blog, tentative discussions have been held between investment banking advisers to the French cognac maker and Brown-Forman, which makes the Tennessee whiskey, although the chances of a takeover by the US drinks company at the moment are judged \"very slim\".
