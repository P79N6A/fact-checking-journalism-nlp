The brothers, who recently turned 50, have sold the family firm Hancocks, which was started in 1962 by their parents Liz and Ray from a single sweet shop in Shepshed, near Loughborough, to the Dutch firm H2 Equity Partners. Andrew Hancock said he was confident the business was in good hands: \"We hand the baton on with pride,\" he said, predicting it would \"go from strength to strength\". \"From a sweet shop in Shepshed, our family has grown the business to a group that serves many thousands of businesses. This can only be great news for our customers, employees and suppliers,\" Hancock said. The British passion for jelly beans, humbugs, fudge, cola bottles and liquorice has added up to big business for Hancocks, which has expanded to become the country's biggest confectionery wholesaler. With 18 cash and carries around the country, the pick'n'mix specialist supplies sweet shops and convenience stores with 5,000 products ranging from jars and pails of boiled sweets to bestsellers from major manufacturers such as Mars and Haribo. It has also cashed in on a surge in popularity for retro sweet brands selling penny sweets \u2013 such as sherbet lemon, flying saucers and rhubarb-and-custards \u2013 from days gone by. The company's growth has accelerated since the demise of Woolworths in 2008 and it made a pre-tax profit of \u00a34.3m last year on sales of \u00a3120m. Following the deal, H2 Equity Partners will own a majority stake, with the remainder owned by a management team led by chief executive Mark Watson. The Hancocks have left the company. Watson insisted it was \"business as usual\" and promised current supplier arrangements would remain in place. \"I am delighted to be leading such a strong company,\" he said. Future plans include expanding the network of depots and its internet operation and developing new own label ranges. Caroline Belcher, a partner at advisory firm Cavendish Corporate Finance which acted for the brothers, described it as a \"sweet deal\" that had found a \"supportive home\" for the 50-year-old family firm. \"From the outset, H2 showed an understanding of the wholesale sector and an appreciation of Hancocks and its family roots,\" she said.",

The commission on banking standards scored a scoop on Thursday when the governor of the Bank of England said he would have preferred a total separation of banks' retail and investment banking activities but his likely successor said he didn't \"completely\" agree with his boss. But let's not get carried away. Even King thinks the best way forward now is for the government to get on with the job of implementing Sir John Vickers' ring-fencing proposals, even if they are several steps short of full separation. Indeed, the more important clash is King v Osborne on the vital issue of the degree of leverage on UK banks' balance sheets. Vickers' panel was crystal clear: leverage should be capped at 25 times capital. But the chancellor has watered down that proposal, saying the government is happy to tolerate 33 times. To most outsiders, it looks as if Osborne has been swayed by the lobbying of the likes of Santander UK, which argues that a mortgage-dominated bank would be constricted by Vickers' harder limits. Vickers was unhappy about the watering-down and King sounds furious. The governor gave a blistering defence of the more conservative approach. International standards for calculating risk-weighted assets are too inflexible; risk weights move over time; and in major crises risks tend to interact. For those reasons, pure leverage ratios have proved the best guide to the strength of a bank in a crisis. As King pointed out, Northern Rock, while fully up-to-date with the Basel banking committee's finely tuned risk calculations, was still operating at 80 times leverage before its collapse. Setting sensible leverage ratios should therefore be at the top of the reform agenda. It's more important than the detail of which activities should lie, or be required to lie, within a ring-fenced bank. If King, Vickers (and Tucker?) think 25 times is high enough and that Osborne is being too racy, that's a major concern. Let's hope the commission, which seems to be in a mischievous mood, kicks up a storm about leverage.",

If King, Vickers (and Tucker?) think 25 times is high enough and that Osborne is being too racy, that's a major concern. Let's hope the commission, which seems to be in a mischievous mood, kicks up a storm about leverage.</p>",

    "webTitle": "Splitting retail and investment banks won't make system safe, Paul Tucker warns", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Paul Tucker, the Bank of England deputy governor who is frontrunner to succeed Sir Mervyn King next year, has clashed with his boss, saying he does not want the full separation of retail and investment banks. He told the parliamentary commission on banking standards that even if full separation of banks was enforced by law, the economy would still be at risk of being \"blown up\" by non-retail banks and other financial institutions. \"People fall into thinking: 'If only we could make retail banking safe, the financial system will be safe,' and frankly I think that is nonsense,\" he said. \"I think the financial system and the economy will be capable of being blown up by vast wholesale dealers and non-banks.\" His comments, coming weeks before the chancellor, George Osborne, is expected to name King's successor, reveal a split with the governor, who has been pushing for full separation for the past five years. Osborne is expected to name the next governor with his autumn statement on 5 December and urged the banking standards commission this week to avoid \"tearing up\" the consensus on reform by pushing for a full bank break-up. He rejected the idea that ringfencing would fail to tackle the risk-taking culture that led to the financial crisis. Tucker supported reforms proposed by Sir John Vickers to ringfence retail banking and said any further delay in implementing the change could damage the economy. \"We should get on with Vickers and I think it will be damaging in all sorts of ways, most importantly to credit conditions if there is a further prolonged period of uncertainty.\" King, who has seven months to serve, agreed the government should implement Vickers now but said there should be a review in the future to decide \"whether we need to go further\". The government needed to define more clearly what banking services it wanted to ringfence. Clarity, said King, was crucial to avoid banks lobbying the regulator. \"For the regulator to be effective, it has to be able to use judgment. But if judgment ends up simply as a negotiation between the regulator and the regulated bank, there's only one winner in that and I think that will be a very bad outcome.\" Tucker also disagreed with the Bank's executive director for financial stability, Andy Haldane, who is in the running for deputy governor. Haldane, who was also giving evidenceon Thursday, said loans, mortgages and loans to small and medium-sized businesses should all be within the ringfence, but Tucker said non-ringfenced banks should offer small business lending too. Haldane said directors should be primarily responsible for ensuring their bank was implementing the ringfence. But regulators should police compliance and punish any bank found to be in breach by requiring that bank to hold extra capital. Beyond that, he said, the regulator should have powers to restructure any bank found \"burrowing under\" the ringfence. Among other proposals by Vickers was a so-called leverage cap for banks of 4% \u2013 essentially the ability to lend out 25 times capital. The government watered that down to a 3% cap \u2013 which would allow banks to lend out 33 times. King said this was \"much too high\". In countries where the banking system was very large, he said, it was in the interests of the government to have a much tougher leverage ratio. King said regulations would only ever require the minimum of banks. Since the financial crisis, investors have been demanding that banks hold more capital and conduct their business in less risky fashion. \"The economics of investment banking is changing \u2013 has changed considerably \u2013 and that itself is driving the new generation of leadership in banks to recognise that it is in their own interest now to change the culture.\" The trouble banks had in raising funds would be exacerbated by uncertainty over the compensation and fines they may have to pay over the Libor scandal, as well as other regulatory fines. \"It's one of the uncertainties that is weighing on banks and will add to the difficulties they will have in obtaining funding,\" said King. Cable call Powerful shareholder bodies are disagreeing over a call by Vince Cable to set up a new investor forum. The business secretary, in his response to the review conducted by economist John Kay, said: \"The review recommended an investor forum and \u2026 I am happy to be a catalyst, but it is not for government to create a quango \u2013 a forum will only succeed if it is created by the investors it represents\". He added: \"High on the to-do list is to tackle complex incentive schemes that encourage short-termism and tend to pay out asymmetrically. Some executives see spectacular rewards for good performance but there is no \u2026 fall in pay when performance is poor.\" The Investment Management Association immediately invited all major investors to begin work on Kay's recommendation, but the Association of British Insurers was less sanguine. Robert Hingley, director of investment affairs at the ABI, said: \"We remain to be convinced about the idea of a new 'investor forum' and this needs very careful consideration: any new collective mechanism must demonstrably enhance and complement investors' individual engagement and existing means of co-ordination\".

The Council is supposed to set a \"commitment ceiling\", which represents the maximum which the EU can promise to spend over the seven years, as well as a \"payments ceiling\", which is the maximum it can actually spend over that period and is generally rather lower. <br>But the actual budget is set annually, in a separate set of negotiations. <br>Historically, the budget has always been well below either of the ceiling figures. But we won't know its size until 2020 - and maybe not even then. <br>Negotiations are still going on in Brussels not only about the budget for 2013, but also the budget for 2012. </p> <p>Q: With Europe in financial trouble, presumably everyone agrees the EU will have to tighten its belt? <br>A: Not at all. More than half of the EU's members - including several of those in the worst financial difficulties, such as Greece - receive more from Brussels than they contribute. Understandably, many of them want to see EU spending rise, particularly on support for disadvantaged regions. The European Commission and European Parliament, too, have both called for an increase in the overall budget. </p> <p>Q: What does Prime Minister David Cameron want? <br>A: Mr Cameron has said he will insist at least on a real-terms freeze in the EU budget, and preferably a cut. He has also said he will protect Britain's rebate. But he is under massive pressure from his own backbenchers, after Tory rebels joined Labour to pass a parliamentary motion demanding a reduction in the budget. </p> <p>Q: What are the proposals on the table at this summit? <br>A: European Council president Herman van Rompuy has put forward a set of proposals which it is thought would result in a commitment ceiling of around \u20ac973bn and a payments ceiling of around \u20ac940bn, at 2011 prices. After inflation has been taken into account, this would amount to a small reduction on the ceilings set for the previous period 2007-13. </p> <p>Q: What does the European Commission want? <br>A: Its latest proposal would see the commitments ceiling soar to \u20ac1,033bn and the payments ceiling to \u20ac988bn, again in 2011 prices. </p> <p>Q: So is Mr Cameron happy with the Van Rompuy proposals? <br>A: Not entirely. Britain regards the President's plan as a step in the right direction, but is wary about what spending levels would actually result. The van Rompuy proposals also involve a reform of the \"Own Resources\" system, including Britain's rebate, which will provoke stiff resistance from London.</p> <p>Q: What about the rebate? <br>A: Britain believes its rebate, negotiated by Margaret Thatcher in the 1980s and currently worth about \u20ac3.6bn a year, remains fully justified. Essentially, the rebate compensates Britain for the fact that, although it is one of Europe's biggest economies, it receives relatively little in support for its farmers through the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP). Without it, the UK's net contribution to Brussels in 2010 would have been \u20ac10.9bn - almost as much as Germany. Even with the the rebate, Britain's net contribution is considerably higher than those of France or Italy. </p> <p>Q: Will the CAP be reformed? <br>A: Mr van Rompuy's plans envisage a small reduction in CAP spending, but this is fiercely resisted by France. Ironically, if the CAP is cut, Britain might end up having to contribute more, because the level of the rebate is fixed according to a complicated mathematical formula including the level of EU spending on agriculture.</p> <p>Q: So how will we know if Mr Cameron has got what he wants? <br>A: It will be difficult to be sure. With so many different measures of EU spending, a freeze or cut in one of the ceilings being set this week may not translate into a freeze or cut in the actual amount of money spent. No figures for the level of the rebate or Britain's net contribution are expected to emerge until some time after the summit, once the number crunchers have had the chance to analyse its outcome.</p> <p>Q: Is the Prime Minister likely to walk out? <br>A: Sources close to Mr Cameron insist he is keen to get a deal this week, though he recognises it will be difficult. It looks likely he will only wield the UK's veto if he feels it is absolutely necessary to avoid an agreement which is not in the national interest. </p> <p>Q: How long will it all last? <br>A: Nobody knows. Mr van Rompuy will hold one-on-one talks with all 27 leaders, including Mr Cameron, before the summit opens. After an initial working session, he will produce a new \"negotiation box\" late today, taking into account the competing priorities of different countries. That will fire the starting gun on a new round of wrangling, with different national teams working through the night to determine whether the new proposals are favourable to them. <br>Few in Brussels believe the arguments will be done and dusted by the official conclusion of the summit tomorrow evening. Chances are there will be talks through the night tomorrow, with a final conclusion - or the collapse of the talks - not arriving until Saturday or even Sunday.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-50ae1747b579714a8ffd35f7\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-11-22T12:15:03.245Z\">12.15pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Rehn: 'no reason' why Greek debt deal can't be done</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Another quick note of optimism on Greece (there are reason to be cheerful, if you look hard enough).

Investors seem to think it's worth a punt.</p> <p>Spain sold nearly \u20ac4bn of bonds with ease at an auction this morning as it kicked off what will be a rather daunting funding programme for 2013.</p> <p>The Treasury beat the top end of the target of \u20ac2.5-3.5bn at borrowing costs that were slightly down from previous auctions - although they are still high.</p> <p>The average yield on the 2021 bond was 5.517%, compared with around 5.6% for the benchmark 10-year on the secondary market, a long way from over 7% levels in July.</p> <p>Nicholas Spiro, managing director of Spiro Sovereign Strategy, has three points to make on it all: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>1. The surreal air of calm surrounding Spain's bond market shows no signs of dissipating. Quite the opposite. The Treasury has met its financing needs for this year and is already pre-funding its 2013 requirements. The fairly modest size of today's auction, and the enduring signalling effect of the ECB's bond-buying programme, made for a relatively successful sale - and one of longer-term paper at that. Demand held up and yields for the 3 and 5-year notes were just a tad below secondary market levels. For the time being, Spain is accessing the market with relative ease.<br>&#xa0;<br>2. Right now, the million dollar question is: how long will the ECB's signalling effect alone suffice to suppress Spanish yields? It's tempting to take the view that the market is becoming less sensitive to a Spanish request for an ECB-backed bond-buying programme. Madrid would like to think this is the case but it's very unlikely, given the scale and severity of Spain's financial and economic plight, that investors no longer believe Spain requires external aid. The reality is that the current standoff over a sovereign bailout for Spain suits all three sides - Madrid, investors and the ECB - to varying degrees.<br>&#xa0;<br>3. This is the longest period of relative calm enjoyed by Spanish and Italian debt markets since the eurozone crisis escalated dramatically in November 2011. Indeed, the yield on 10-year Spanish paper now stands at the top end of the band in which it was trading early last year when Spain was said to have \"decoupled\" from its more distressed eurozone peers. But while the ECB is holding the fort, eurozone leaders keep dragging their feet in putting in place the political, regulatory and institutional measures needed to shore up the ill-managed single currency area.&#xa0;</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-50adfd58b579a05c24cb1490\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-11-22T10:24:24.723Z\">10.24am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Cameron first</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>David Cameron is the first of the string of EU leaders to being ushered in to meet with the European Commission president, Jos\u00e9 Manuel Barroso, and the European Council president and summit chairman, Herman Van Rompuy this morning.</p> <p>This is part of an unusual pre-summit effort to avoid deadlock when the actual thing gets under way tonight over dinner - although we'll see about that.</p> <p>Cameron wants at least a real-terms freeze in EU spending, if not actual cuts, and to retain in full Britain's EU budget rebate worth nearly \u00a33bn a year off the UK's annual contributions to Brussels.</p> <p>A pre-summit compromise is already on offer - a seven-year budget \"envelope\" of \u20ac940bn for 2014/2020 - a cut of nearly \u20ac5bn compared with the 2007/2013 ceiling.</p> <p>The move was seen in Downing Street as being in the right direction - although the \"cut\" is in a spending ceiling which officials say has not been reached.</p> <p>It is also above the \u20ac886bn originally pitched by the Treasury as in line with the real-terms freeze Cameron wants.</p> <p>The Prime Minister's allies for budget belt-tightening, including Sweden and the Netherlands, have both demanded hefty financial cuts.

The lack of change in the headline composite index (45.8 versus 45.7 in October) reflected diverging movements across the main components. In a clear sign that fiscal tightening continues to take a heavy toll on domestic demand, the services PMI fell from 46.0 to a 40-month low of 45.7. The manufacturing PMI, by contrast, improved, but at 46.2 it remains in deep contraction territory.</p> <p>Looking at the available country data, the French composite output index rose for a second month from 43.5 to 44.6, while the German equivalent also edged higher from 47.7 to 47.9. A flash estimate for the other Eurozone countries is not available, but the average for this group sank further into contraction territory \u2013 which arguably is the most disturbing aspect of today\u2019s report.</p> <p>All in all, today\u2019s PMI figures confirm that the eurozone economy remains firmly stuck in recession. Looking ahead, we still think that ECB\u2019s recent actions and the improvement in the global economy (as signaled by the further pickup in the Chinese PMI) will provide some respite to the Eurozone economy. But with the fiscal squeeze across the region continuing, any return to positive growth next year will likely be slow and gradual \u2013 and largely confined to the \u2018core\u2019 countries.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2012-11-22T10:49:39.926Z\">at 10.49am GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-50adf075b579a05c24cb1489\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-11-22T09:29:25.880Z\">9.29am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Eurozone as bad as 2009</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Another half hour, another set of PMIs.</p> <p>It seems that the eurozone economy is on course for its weakest quarter since early 2009, as business surveys showed companies battling shrinking order books in November.

Speaking of Spain, the New York Times is running a hard-hitting piece about how Spaniards are scrimping in the time of crisis. Dan Bilefsky writes: Mar\u00eda Cristina Riveros can barely afford to live, let alone die. So when the end comes, she insists, there will be no spray of red roses or marble tombstone to mark her grave. Instead she is donating her body to science, to avoid being a financial burden on her family. I\u2019m not upset about death \u2014 I\u2019m upset about life,\u201d said Mrs. Riveros, 53, an unemployed geriatric nurse and single mother, as she waited in line on a recent day for food at a church here. In steps Spanish prime minister Mariano Rajoy, who is sounding very relaxed about the budget discussions. I would like us to reach an agreement, but there is no drama if there's no agreement tonight. He is expecting a \"reasonable\" budget. Our main concerns are agriculture, the regions, ultra-peripheral regions, such as Ceuta, Melilla. If the EU budget goes down, then Spain will have to contribute less. But it is premature to talk about numbers now. He does, however, expect negotiations to be \"difficult\". I'm going to be very active, as usual. I'm attending this [summit] with a constructive spirit. No pictures of him emerging from a car just yet. Quick look at the markets, which rose for a fourth day running, after strong Chinese data boosted mining stocks. UK FTSE 100: up 0.7%, or 39 points, at 5791 points Spain IBEX: up 1% Italy FTSE MIB: up 1% France CAC: up 0.6% Germany DAX: up 0.9% Rakesh Shah, FX Trader at Saxo, said: Even with the potential for news of a compromise solution for the budget participation of the UK within the eurozone, markets will quickly begin to price in the uncertainty over the US fiscal cliff. So any euphoria with good news can be expected to be short lived. Dark clouds lie ahead, with 2013 approaching and more questions than answers right now. Will the UK continue to be perceived as a relative safe haven within the eurozone? Until this question can be answered with some conviction, the FTSE 100 markets can be expected to remain range bound. Next up, Polish PM Donald Tusk. Tusk says the UK is \"very likely\" to block a budget compromise at the EU summit. And over to French president Fran\u00e7ois Hollande. He is not in Brussels to pose an ultimatum but to find a compromise, apparently. Europe is a compromise, not individual interests. I am here to find a consensus with the help of Germany, not to impose an ultimatum. Merkel says there is a chance of a second summit to discuss the EU budget, after a decision on Greece was postponed for a second meeting. It is important that we arrive at a solution. Whether that can happen now in these two days, Thursday and Friday, I don't know. Germany wants to reach the goal but it may be that we need a further stage. And now for the politicians laying the ground for another failed summit. German Chancellor Angela Merkel has said an EU budget deal may not be possible this week. She, at least, is saying she is prepared to compromise to reach a deal. Judging by the posturing from everyone else she may have to compromise quite substantially to reach any kind of agreement. There's talk that British PM David Cameron will veer even further away from Europe and call an in/out referendum in 2014. A recent opinion poll showed that 56% percent of Britons would either definitely, or most likely, vote to leave the EU in a referendum. Only 30% said they wanted the UK to remain a member. The desire to leave cut across all the three main political parties. There are some miserable consumer confidence figures out of the eurozone, where morale has apparently hit a three-and-a-half year low. European Commission figures show confidence dropped again in November to a 42-month low. Confidence had previously edged up in October after falling continuously over the four-month period between June and September. Howard Archer of IHS Global Insight said: The renewed drop in confidence reinforces suspicion that Eurozone consumers will be extremely careful in their spending in the fourth quarter, thereby contributing to a likely further fall in GDP. Indeed, with consumer confidence sinking to a 42-month low in November and the purchasing managers\u2019 surveys pointing to ongoing appreciable overall contraction in services and manufacturing activity and new orders, the Eurozone seems headed for deeper GDP contraction in the fourth quarter than the 0.1% quarter-on-quarter drop that occurred in the third quarter. Here's a picture of Monti arriving at the summit. Mario Monti is being particularly vociferous in his opposition. The Italian PM says he will not accept any compromise on the budget. He says Italy is disproportionately penalised in the EU budget adn that it will refuse any \"unacceptable outcomes\". Monti also makes the same point as Cameron, that the EU must show constraint when national governments are having to cut back. Back to the eurozone summit, where Cameron is not, in fact alone in his bid to veto the budget. Think tank Open Europe has developed an entire football squad of naysayers, with Cameron as centre forward in prime position to strike. They write: CF:David Cameron leads the line, ready to strike and seen as the most likely to pull the trigger on any veto. RW: Swedish Prime Minister Fredrik Reinfeldt at right winger hugging the line (sticking to his guns), happy to put in a shift for the team and more likely to offer an assist/support for Cameron than to deliver the final blow himself. AM: French President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande is the mercurial trickster playing between the lines but not quite sure of his role or his aims. Ultimately a selfish player (as are many of the others) but who\u2019s own personal gain could ultimately be detrimental to the rest of the team. DM: Italian Prime Minister Mario Monti is playing the stoic holding role, refusing to budge and occasionally gesticulating wildly at the referee, although never actually getting into the danger zone at the forefront of the action. More likely to break up play and provide a stumbling block than deliver a knockout blow to the opposition. Unlike the rest of the team, not here on merit (elected) but parachuted in by the powers above. ... (more here). Right, that's me done so I'm leaving you in the (more) capable hands of my colleague Jo Moulds. The German finance minister, Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble, is at it again, by which we mean declaring his opposition to a writedown of public holdings of Greek debt. He said today: The moment we decide to give Greece a haircut, we cannot give Greece any new guarantees - that is logical because the budget law rightly says you can only take on guarantees if you believe that the debt will be paid back so you can't do both. He said as much last week, and at the end of October, so top marks for consistency - both to Sch\u00e4uble and the hacks who keep asking him the same question. Lordy, it's quiet. So while we all wait for a load of politicians to sort out the Euro budget over a nice supper (plus midnight feast and breakfast) it is perhaps not the worst time to run through exactly what this is all about. The Press Association's political editor Andrew Woodcock has written a nice QnA on all this: Q: What's the summit all about? A: This special summit of the 27 leaders of EU member states has been called to set the ceiling for European Union spending over the seven-year period 2014-20 - known in euro-speak as the Multiyear Financial Framework or MFF. As well as a global figure for spending, the leaders also aim to agree a framework for contributions by member states to fund the EU's activities and around 70 spending programmes for different policy areas - such as growth, agriculture or security - which will shape the EU's priorities up to the end of the decade. Q: So can we expect to know by the end of it exactly the size of the EU's budget for the rest of the decade? A: It's not as simple as that. The Council is supposed to set a \"commitment ceiling\", which represents the maximum which the EU can promise to spend over the seven years, as well as a \"payments ceiling\", which is the maximum it can actually spend over that period and is generally rather lower. But the actual budget is set annually, in a separate set of negotiations. Historically, the budget has always been well below either of the ceiling figures. But we won't know its size until 2020 - and maybe not even then. Negotiations are still going on in Brussels not only about the budget for 2013, but also the budget for 2012. Q: With Europe in financial trouble, presumably everyone agrees the EU will have to tighten its belt? A: Not at all. More than half of the EU's members - including several of those in the worst financial difficulties, such as Greece - receive more from Brussels than they contribute. Understandably, many of them want to see EU spending rise, particularly on support for disadvantaged regions. The European Commission and European Parliament, too, have both called for an increase in the overall budget. Q: What does Prime Minister David Cameron want? A: Mr Cameron has said he will insist at least on a real-terms freeze in the EU budget, and preferably a cut. He has also said he will protect Britain's rebate. But he is under massive pressure from his own backbenchers, after Tory rebels joined Labour to pass a parliamentary motion demanding a reduction in the budget. Q: What are the proposals on the table at this summit? A: European Council president Herman van Rompuy has put forward a set of proposals which it is thought would result in a commitment ceiling of around \u20ac973bn and a payments ceiling of around \u20ac940bn, at 2011 prices. After inflation has been taken into account, this would amount to a small reduction on the ceilings set for the previous period 2007-13. Q: What does the European Commission want? A: Its latest proposal would see the commitments ceiling soar to \u20ac1,033bn and the payments ceiling to \u20ac988bn, again in 2011 prices. Q: So is Mr Cameron happy with the Van Rompuy proposals? A: Not entirely. Britain regards the President's plan as a step in the right direction, but is wary about what spending levels would actually result. The van Rompuy proposals also involve a reform of the \"Own Resources\" system, including Britain's rebate, which will provoke stiff resistance from London. Q: What about the rebate? A: Britain believes its rebate, negotiated by Margaret Thatcher in the 1980s and currently worth about \u20ac3.6bn a year, remains fully justified. Essentially, the rebate compensates Britain for the fact that, although it is one of Europe's biggest economies, it receives relatively little in support for its farmers through the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP). Without it, the UK's net contribution to Brussels in 2010 would have been \u20ac10.9bn - almost as much as Germany. Even with the the rebate, Britain's net contribution is considerably higher than those of France or Italy. Q: Will the CAP be reformed? A: Mr van Rompuy's plans envisage a small reduction in CAP spending, but this is fiercely resisted by France. Ironically, if the CAP is cut, Britain might end up having to contribute more, because the level of the rebate is fixed according to a complicated mathematical formula including the level of EU spending on agriculture. Q: So how will we know if Mr Cameron has got what he wants? A: It will be difficult to be sure. With so many different measures of EU spending, a freeze or cut in one of the ceilings being set this week may not translate into a freeze or cut in the actual amount of money spent. No figures for the level of the rebate or Britain's net contribution are expected to emerge until some time after the summit, once the number crunchers have had the chance to analyse its outcome. Q: Is the Prime Minister likely to walk out? A: Sources close to Mr Cameron insist he is keen to get a deal this week, though he recognises it will be difficult. It looks likely he will only wield the UK's veto if he feels it is absolutely necessary to avoid an agreement which is not in the national interest. Q: How long will it all last? A: Nobody knows. Mr van Rompuy will hold one-on-one talks with all 27 leaders, including Mr Cameron, before the summit opens. After an initial working session, he will produce a new \"negotiation box\" late today, taking into account the competing priorities of different countries. That will fire the starting gun on a new round of wrangling, with different national teams working through the night to determine whether the new proposals are favourable to them. Few in Brussels believe the arguments will be done and dusted by the official conclusion of the summit tomorrow evening. Chances are there will be talks through the night tomorrow, with a final conclusion - or the collapse of the talks - not arriving until Saturday or even Sunday. Another quick note of optimism on Greece (there are reason to be cheerful, if you look hard enough). The country has taken all the steps necessary to secure its next tranche of aid, and eurozone finance ministers should be able to sign off definitively on the assistance on Monday, the European commissioner for economic affairs has said. Olli Rehn told the European parliament: I trust everyone will reconvene in Brussels on Monday with the necessary constructive spirit, and move beyond the detrimental mindset of red lines. Frankly, I see no reason why we should not be able to conclude the package - and do away with the uncertainty that has been holding back a return of confidence, and thus of investment and growth, in Greece. Still, cynics might say they can identify at least one reason it all might fail: namely form. Finance ministers have met twice in the past two weeks but failed both times to agree on the next steps for Greece and how to bring its debt level down to a sustainable level, despite more than 24 hours of negotiation. Back at the Commission on Banking Standards, Paul Tucker, the frontrunner to become the next governor of the Bank of England, told MPs he does not want to see the full separation of retail and investment banks, warning that even if it were forced by law, the economy would still be at risk of being \u201cblown up\u201d by non-retail banks and other financial institutions. He said: \u201cThe thing that has worried me most about this debate from the beginning... is that people fall into thinking, \u2018if only we could make retail banking safe, the financial system will be safe\u2019, and frankly I think that is nonsense. I think the financial system and the economy will be capable of being blown up by vast wholesale dealers and non-banks.\u201d The full story will be online shortly. Bit of Spanish debt anyone? Investors seem to think it's worth a punt. Spain sold nearly \u20ac4bn of bonds with ease at an auction this morning as it kicked off what will be a rather daunting funding programme for 2013. The Treasury beat the top end of the target of \u20ac2.5-3.5bn at borrowing costs that were slightly down from previous auctions - although they are still high. The average yield on the 2021 bond was 5.517%, compared with around 5.6% for the benchmark 10-year on the secondary market, a long way from over 7% levels in July. Nicholas Spiro, managing director of Spiro Sovereign Strategy, has three points to make on it all: 1. The surreal air of calm surrounding Spain's bond market shows no signs of dissipating. Quite the opposite. The Treasury has met its financing needs for this year and is already pre-funding its 2013 requirements. The fairly modest size of today's auction, and the enduring signalling effect of the ECB's bond-buying programme, made for a relatively successful sale - and one of longer-term paper at that. Demand held up and yields for the 3 and 5-year notes were just a tad below secondary market levels. For the time being, Spain is accessing the market with relative ease. 2. Right now, the million dollar question is: how long will the ECB's signalling effect alone suffice to suppress Spanish yields? It's tempting to take the view that the market is becoming less sensitive to a Spanish request for an ECB-backed bond-buying programme. Madrid would like to think this is the case but it's very unlikely, given the scale and severity of Spain's financial and economic plight, that investors no longer believe Spain requires external aid. The reality is that the current standoff over a sovereign bailout for Spain suits all three sides - Madrid, investors and the ECB - to varying degrees. 3. This is the longest period of relative calm enjoyed by Spanish and Italian debt markets since the eurozone crisis escalated dramatically in November 2011. Indeed, the yield on 10-year Spanish paper now stands at the top end of the band in which it was trading early last year when Spain was said to have \"decoupled\" from its more distressed eurozone peers. But while the ECB is holding the fort, eurozone leaders keep dragging their feet in putting in place the political, regulatory and institutional measures needed to shore up the ill-managed single currency area. David Cameron is the first of the string of EU leaders to being ushered in to meet with the European Commission president, Jos\u00e9 Manuel Barroso, and the European Council president and summit chairman, Herman Van Rompuy this morning. This is part of an unusual pre-summit effort to avoid deadlock when the actual thing gets under way tonight over dinner - although we'll see about that. Cameron wants at least a real-terms freeze in EU spending, if not actual cuts, and to retain in full Britain's EU budget rebate worth nearly \u00a33bn a year off the UK's annual contributions to Brussels. A pre-summit compromise is already on offer - a seven-year budget \"envelope\" of \u20ac940bn for 2014/2020 - a cut of nearly \u20ac5bn compared with the 2007/2013 ceiling. The move was seen in Downing Street as being in the right direction - although the \"cut\" is in a spending ceiling which officials say has not been reached. It is also above the \u20ac886bn originally pitched by the Treasury as in line with the real-terms freeze Cameron wants. The Prime Minister's allies for budget belt-tightening, including Sweden and the Netherlands, have both demanded hefty financial cuts. Germany, France, Finland and Austria want to freeze the maximum Brussels can draw from member states every year - leaving plenty of scope to argue over the actual spending figures within the ceiling. And 15 countries, led by Poland, are backing budget increases - not least to preserve the scale of cash aid they receive as \"net beneficiaries\" from the EU kitty. If you can bear to drag yourself away from all the action in the eurozone, the Banking Standards Commission hearing has kicked off. My colleague Jo Moulds, who follows these things so that we don't have to, reports: The Bank of England governor, Sir Mervyn King, is counting down the days to the end of his term. \"Seven months, eight days\", he told Andrew Tyrie. \"Is it that bad? asked Tyrie. King added that the ringfence should start with defining what are core banking services. So you stick the ringfence around them and not the other way round as it's hard to define what is prop trading etc. Meanwhile - Paul Tucker has finally made a contribution after a very quiet start (who can blame him after his last performance in front of MPs over Libor?). He says that future EU law could allow the regulator to require banks to restructure so that they are \u201cresolvable\u201d. The periphery is getting more peripheral, it seems. Here's ING's Martin van Vliet with his reaction to the euro zone PMI data: The weak Eurozone PMI outturn for November is a major disappointment in light of the increases in the German and French PMI surveys, and suggest that that the recession on the Eurozone\u2019s periphery is gathering further pace. The lack of change in the headline composite index (45.8 versus 45.7 in October) reflected diverging movements across the main components. In a clear sign that fiscal tightening continues to take a heavy toll on domestic demand, the services PMI fell from 46.0 to a 40-month low of 45.7. The manufacturing PMI, by contrast, improved, but at 46.2 it remains in deep contraction territory. Looking at the available country data, the French composite output index rose for a second month from 43.5 to 44.6, while the German equivalent also edged higher from 47.7 to 47.9. A flash estimate for the other Eurozone countries is not available, but the average for this group sank further into contraction territory \u2013 which arguably is the most disturbing aspect of today\u2019s report. All in all, today\u2019s PMI figures confirm that the eurozone economy remains firmly stuck in recession. Looking ahead, we still think that ECB\u2019s recent actions and the improvement in the global economy (as signaled by the further pickup in the Chinese PMI) will provide some respite to the Eurozone economy. But with the fiscal squeeze across the region continuing, any return to positive growth next year will likely be slow and gradual \u2013 and largely confined to the \u2018core\u2019 countries. Another half hour, another set of PMIs. It seems that the eurozone economy is on course for its weakest quarter since early 2009, as business surveys showed companies battling shrinking order books in November. Reuters reports: Service sector firms like banks and hotels that comprise the bulk of the economy fared particularly badly this month, and laid off staff at a faster pace. While the monthly rate of decline that manufacturers reported eased far more than economists anticipated, Markit's latest Purchasing Managers' Indexes (PMIs) pointed to little change overall for a recession-hit euro zone this month. The flash service sector PMI fell to 45.7 this month, its lowest reading since July 2009, the survey showed on Thursday, failing to meet the expectations of economists who thought it would hold at October's 46.0. Still, there are more positive signs in other sectors: While we are being promised a solution to Greece very soon (honestly), there is an intriguing report in the FT about how Argentina is being made to pay $1.3bn to hedge funds that refused to restructure their debts after the country\u2019s 2001 default. The US court ruling, made late on Wednesday in New York, apparently raises the possibility of Argentina defaulting again, but more significantly it seems to undermine the concept of sovereign immunity against creditors that has \"largely reigned in international law for almost a century\". By the way, if you'll forgive the rather strained link, for anyone wanting to read an accessible guide to the euro crisis, there are many worse than this - with thanks to Pedro Barrento. Mixed news from Germany. On one hand its November manufacturing PMI has come in at 46.8, compared to the consensus estimate of 46.0. But on the other, services PMI came in at 48.0, less than estimates of only 48.4. Markit Economics, which releases the figures, has some historical context: Some good news, of sorts. France has provided a less miserable start to the day than feared. Its manufacturing PMI rose more than expected last month, the preliminary data shows, to a seasonally adjusted 44.7, from 43.7. Obviously that still represents a contraction, but analysts had expected the measure to rise to only 44.1. Still, some depressing caveats remain. London markets have opened and we are up \u2013 at least partly on the back of a return to growth of in Chinese manufacturing, which boosted demand prospects for the produce of FTSE metals and energy companies. The Chinese HSBC Flash Manufacturing PMI rose to 50.4 in November \u2013 more than 50 separates growth from contraction. This is the sector's first period of growth in 13 months. The FTSE was up about 0.3%. There are far worse ways of starting the morning than listening to Michael Hewson, the senior market analyst at CMC Markets. Here are a few of his early thoughts: Putting aside and parking the perennial problem of Greece and the preoccupation about its debt to GDP ratio and debt sustainability for a few days, there remains the problem of a European economy mired in recession, with EU leaders too preoccupied with meetings and protracted budget negotiations to notice that growth is non-existent and unemployment continues to rise rapidly. This is expected to be reinforced by preliminary November manufacturing and services PMI for France, Germany and the aggregated Eurozone numbers, which aren\u2019t expected to show much of an improvement on figures a couple of weeks ago. Needless to say while some small improvements are expected, the numbers still point to a Q4 in Europe firmly in contraction with Germany starting to feel the proverbial chill quite sharply. Expectations are for France manufacturing and services PMI to improve slightly to 44.1 and 45.3 respectively, while Germany manufacturing and services is expected to remain unchanged at 46 and 48.4. The Eurozone numbers for manufacturing and services are expected to improve slightly to 45.6 and 46.1. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the eurozone crisis. Oh, and happy Thanksgiving. Obviously the US will be eating rather than working this afternoon, so much of the market action is going to be packed into the first part of our day. There have been a few gains overnight (the euro has hit a six-and-a-half-month high against the yen) as traders seem to have bought the line from politicians that a deal on emergency aid for Greece is close (you may have heard that one before). We are also awaiting a string of PMI numbers, get the Banking Standards Commission quizzing a trio from the Bank of England \u2013 governor Sir Mervyn King, (the governor in waiting?) Paul Tucker and Andy Haldane. And, of course, later today EU leaders meet to overcome deep divisions over the bloc's spending plans, worth almost \u20ac1tn. Obviously when we say \"overcome\" that is aspiration rather than expectation.",

Digitas research shows that 28% of shoppers plan to use mobile apps to shop \u2013 on Thursday, not Monday. Target is offering online deals as early as Thanksgiving Day and also had a \"beat-the-rush\" sale on its website before people even started traveling for Thanksgiving.

What the numbers say is that the huge percentage growth in sales is on Monday,\" Davidowitz said. \"My retail clients are all planning on that, and are planning special promotions for Cyber Monday.\" </p> <p>In fact, Davidowitz believes Cyber Monday will be a bigger shopping day than Black Friday, as it has been for the past two years. \"Everyone who's opening all these early hours, and all this carrying on, sales will be up 2-3% if they're lucky,\" he said of Black Friday.</p> <p>In fact, with so many retailers, like Amazon and coupon sites, working exclusively online, Cyber Monday can't be dropped because they don't expect physical inventory to fly off the shelves.</p> <p>Davidowitz is projecting $2bn in sales for Cyber Monday. ComScore, a data firm, said it expects $1.5bn in sales that day.</p> <p>\"There's no death. Hold the funeral,\" Davidowitz said of the speculation about the death of Cyber Monday. \"It's the opposite of dead.\"</p>",

Increasingly, however, the deals happen earlier, and on smaller screens. Digitas research shows that 28% of shoppers plan to use mobile apps to shop \u2013 on Thursday, not Monday. Target is offering online deals as early as Thanksgiving Day and also had a \"beat-the-rush\" sale on its website before people even started traveling for Thanksgiving. Wal-Mart also had a pre-Black Friday sale online, although it was planned to end well before Thanksgiving. The Black Friday sales online at Kohl's actually started on Wednesday. But the retail industry has a plan, says Howard Davidowitz. He's the chairman of Davidowitz &amp; Associates, a New York-based retain consulting and investment banking firm. He says Cyber Monday will survive, just as Black Friday has. \"Why would someone wait in line for four hours when they could get the same thing for less online? You would need a clinical psychologist to answer that. I don't know. What the numbers say is that the huge percentage growth in sales is on Monday,\" Davidowitz said. \"My retail clients are all planning on that, and are planning special promotions for Cyber Monday.\" In fact, Davidowitz believes Cyber Monday will be a bigger shopping day than Black Friday, as it has been for the past two years. \"Everyone who's opening all these early hours, and all this carrying on, sales will be up 2-3% if they're lucky,\" he said of Black Friday. In fact, with so many retailers, like Amazon and coupon sites, working exclusively online, Cyber Monday can't be dropped because they don't expect physical inventory to fly off the shelves. Davidowitz is projecting $2bn in sales for Cyber Monday. ComScore, a data firm, said it expects $1.5bn in sales that day. \"There's no death. Hold the funeral,\" Davidowitz said of the speculation about the death of Cyber Monday. \"It's the opposite of dead.\"",

Autonomy signed a \u00a320m sponsorship deal with the football club in 2010. A spokesman for Deloitte said there was no link between Mercer's involvement with both clients. The proportion of non-audit work Deloitte did for Autonomy had reduced over the years.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 22 November 2012. In the original $8.8bn was converted to \u00a35.5m, rather than \u00a35.5bn. The article was further amended on 26 November 2012 to remove an incorrect reference to RBC Capital Markets giving a positive recommendation for Autonomy stock in the year before its acquisition. In fact RBC switched its recommendation from negative to neutral in the 18 months before the completion.</p>",

That is a bad consequence and that might be what happened here.\" Autonomy's chief operating officer, Andrew Kanter, wrote to Morland's bosses at Astaire Securities, where he worked at the time, insisting on corrections and retractions to his published research. One letter said: \"Autonomy likes to encourage robust debate among analysts,\" but it went on to accuse Morland of \"knowing dissemination of false information into the marketplace\". Morland described how he was one of three analysts \u2013 Daud Khan at JP Morgan Cazenove and Roger Phillips at Merchant Equity Partners were the others \u2013 who were not allowed to ask questions at a particularly fraught results presentation. At one point Khan was banned from attending results announcements for a year. Pressure was also put on technology specialists. Khan did not respond to requests to comment. Alan Pelz-Sharpe, of IT experts 451 Research, was banned from speaking to company staff. He said: \"I was essentially blacklisted by them, so in theory nobody there could talk to me. If I wrote anything critical I would have a threatening note come back saying my report was riddled with inaccuracies and there was no way it could go to press.\" Lynch said on Wednesday there was no sense in the claim by HP that more than $200m of improperly recorded revenue led to a writedown worth billions. \"After being ambushed by all this yesterday, I've had a chance to look at some of the things that they're saying \u2013 it just doesn't add up,\" Lynch said in an interview with technology site All Things D. \"HP is looking for scapegoats, and I'm afraid I'm not going to be one of those.\" The 47-year-old, who left the combined company in May, said that he has no plans to hire a lawyer and has not been in contact with HP. Deloitte's deal Deloitte, the top four accountancy firm that signed off Autonomy's annual reports, earned \u00a34.44m in non-audit fees from the technology firm during the last four years it was charged with scrutinising the accounts. The sum, paid for advice on tax, acquisitions and other services \"pursuant to legislation\", is close to the \u00a35.422m Deloitte collected for auditing work. Investor advisory service PIRC has in the past recommended Autonomy shareholders vote against the reappointment of Deloitte on the grounds that it was conflicted by taking extra commissions. Definitions of auditing tasks vary, and PIRC rules put the fees earned by Deloitte that had nothing to do with auditing at 40% over the four year period. Nigel Mercer, the Cambridge-based Deloitte partner who scrutinised Autonomy in 2010, was also Tottenham Hotspur's auditor. Autonomy signed a \u00a320m sponsorship deal with the football club in 2010. A spokesman for Deloitte said there was no link between Mercer's involvement with both clients. The proportion of non-audit work Deloitte did for Autonomy had reduced over the years. \u2022 This article was amended on 22 November 2012. In the original $8.8bn was converted to \u00a35.5m, rather than \u00a35.5bn. The article was further amended on 26 November 2012 to remove an incorrect reference to RBC Capital Markets giving a positive recommendation for Autonomy stock in the year before its acquisition. In fact RBC switched its recommendation from negative to neutral in the 18 months before the completion.",
