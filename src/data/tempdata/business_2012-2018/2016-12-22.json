      "bodyText": "The US department of justice has accused Barclays of jeopardising the financial position of millions of American homeowners over a decade-old mortgage bond mis-selling scandal. The DoJ is now taking the bank to court, in what was thought to be the first time an institution had failed to reached a settlement with the US authorities over the sale of residential mortgage-backed securities (RMBS) in the run-up to the banking crisis. Responding to the news on Thursday night, Barclays said it would fight the case. Loretta Lynch, the US attorney general, said: \u201cFinancial institutions like Barclays occupy a position of vital public trust. Ordinary Americans depend on their assurances of transparency and legitimacy, and entrust these banks with their valuable savings.\u201d As the DoJ issued its civil claim in the New York courts, Lynch said: \u201cAs alleged in this complaint, Barclays jeopardised billions of dollars of wealth through practices that were plainly irresponsible and dishonest. With this filing, we are sending a clear message that the department of justice will not tolerate the defrauding of investors and the American people.\u201d No figure was released about the sum that the DoJ had been seeking from Barclays for settling the complaint, which was announced amid speculation that Deutsche Bank was close to reaching an agreement over the mis-selling scandal. Deutsche Bank has been facing a $14bn settlement with the DoJ over similar allegations and when the size of the potential penalty leaked in September the shares in Germany\u2019s biggest bank tumbled to new lows. Deutsche\u2019s chief executive, John Cryan, has repeatedly insisted that it will not agree to pay such a penalty for a mis-selling saga that dates back to 2005. Earlier this week Reuters reported that the Swiss bank Credit Suisse had been asked to pay between $5bn and $7bn to settle the long-running investigation. Bailed-out Royal Bank of Scotland has repeatedly warned that it too faces a penalty from the DoJ over the investigation that reflects an attempt by outgoing president Barack Obama to hold banks accountable for selling the bonds \u2013 which packaged up home loans \u2013 without telling investors about the risks. Analysts have calculated that RBS could face a bill of up to \u00a39bn. Since the election of Donald Trump \u2013 who takes office next month \u2013 analysts have been to trying to gauge what impact this might have on outstanding investigations. In an announcement that will be released to the London Stock Exchange on Friday, Barclays said it would fight the DoJ. \u201cBarclays rejects the claims made in the complaint. Barclays considers that the claims made in the complaint are disconnected from the facts. We have an obligation to our shareholders, customers, clients, and employees to defend ourselves against unreasonable allegations and demands.

The government\u2019s complaint alleges that Barclays fraudulently sold investors RMBS full of mortgages it knew were likely to fail, all the while telling investors that the mortgages backing the securities were sound.\u201d The complaint covered the period between 2005 and 2007 and includes allegations of misleading staff against two Barclays staff. The scheme involved 36 RMBS deals in which $31bn worth of loans were packaged up in securitisations. The DoJ more usually reaches settlements with major financial firms over its investigations and has done so in relation to RMBS with a number of US banks, including JP Morgan, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, Bank of America Merrill Lynch and Citi. The US has recouped $48bn so far as a result of the mortgage bond mis-selling. Barclays has set aside \u00a34bn for upcoming fines and litigation but did not have a specific provision for RMBS. Bloomberg reported that Barclays had hired law firm Williams &amp; Connolly to run its defence against the DoJ.",

      "bodyText": "All has gone quiet in Italy, so I\u2019m going to pause this liveblog - but I\u2019ll try to pop back if anything dramatic happens. Otherwise, keep an eye on the Guardian Business page for fresh developments. Here\u2019s the situation right now, by my colleagues Jill Treanor and Stephanie Kirchgaessner (out in Rome): The Italian government is braced to bail out the world\u2019s oldest bank, Monte dei Paschi di Siena (MPS), which is expected to reveal it has failed to win support from private investors for a \u20ac5bn (\u00a34.2bn) rescue package. The board of Italy\u2019s third largest bank was meeting on Thursday after it failed to secure an anchor investor \u2013 thought to be the Qatar sovereign wealth fund \u2013 to support its fundraising effort. Shares in the bank were volatile, lifting off record lows but then falling back in confusion about the next steps. The shares \u2013 down 85% this year \u2013 slumped by 7.5%. MPS is under instruction from the European Central Bank to bolster its finances after it was the weakest of 51 European banks subjected to stress tests. The inability to convince Qatar to put in up to \u20ac1bn is expected to lead the bank\u2019s board to concede it would not be able to secure a solution to its capital gap without the Italian government. This means Italy would have to impose losses on bondholders before it could stump up cash because of new EU rules intended to stop taxpayers having to pick up the bill for bank losses. However, about \u20ac2bn of the bonds are held by private investors and there are expectations that an arrangement would be put in place to limit their losses. The Italian cabinet is expected to convene on Thursday to discuss its options for protecting retail investors and to try to limit its eventual stake in the bank to below 50%. The bailout is not just a financial issue. It is also expected to have political consequences for Italy\u2019s controlling Democratic party and Matteo Renzi, the former prime minister who stepped down from office earlier this month after he was roundly defeated in the 4 December referendum. Paolo Gentiloni has taken over as prime minister for now, but Renzi is expected to run for election again as early as next year. Wolfango Piccoli, an analyst with Teneo Intelligence, said a government rescue might not be immediately damaging politically, in large part because public attention will be diverted from the issue during the Christmas period. But the issue could become \u201cpolitically toxic\u201d later, once it becomes clear how many of the bank\u2019s junior bondholders are eventually compensated for their losses, and how long it takes for them to be paid.... Piccoli said: \u201cIn terms of the junior bondholders, let\u2019s see what happens. it will eventually be decided by Brussels,\u201d Once MPS is saved, a number of other banks could also require government support, keeping the issue in the news for the foreseeable future. \u201cThis will drag on for some time. If we have elections in May or June, it will be used then [against Renzi\u2019s Democratic party], and there is no way to deflect that.\u201d Here\u2019s their full story: Shares on Monte dei Paschi (MPS) have slumped to a new all-time low tonight, as investors anticipate a state bailout for the bank. After another volatile day, they closed down 7.5% at \u20ac15.08 - around 99.85% lower than in early 2007. MPS\u2019s apparent failure to raise \u20ac5bn in new capital means investors now expect the Italian government to step in; a move which could end up with it owning a large stake in the bank. Paresh Davdra, CEO and Co-Founder of RationalFX, says: The failure of MPS to secure \u20ac5bn from an anchor investor will have far ranging implications, as the Italian government prepares for a \u20ac20bn bailout. With the Italian banking sector in an incredibly fragile state and the ongoing Deutsche Bank situation creating uncertainty in Europe\u2019s banking system as a whole, an unsuccessful rescue effort could destabilise the Eurozone. So, what happens next with Monte dei Paschi? We\u2019re basically waiting for the bank\u2019s board to conclude their meeting, and submit their request for state aid (having failed to raise the necessary \u20ac5bn from private investors to strengthen their balance sheet). Then the ball is in new prime minister Paolo Gentiloni\u2019s court; will his cabinet meet this evening, or push the decision back to Friday? Reuters reckons it could go either way. Here\u2019s their latest report: Italy\u2019s government will meet late Thursday or early Friday before European markets open to discuss an emergency decree to bail out troubled bank Monte dei Paschi di Siena, sources familiar with the matter told Reuters. The salvage of Monte dei Paschi would be part of a \u20ac20bn safety net that Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloni plans to set up beneath the banking industry. Gentiloni said on Thursday the cabinet would meet on Friday to discuss measures to help Italy\u2019s under-developed southern regions. He did not mention the banking decree, leaving open the door on a late-night meeting on Thursday. European stock markets have closed for the night, after a fairly dull day dominated by worries over Monte dei Paschi. London\u2019s FTSE 100 gained 22 points, or 0.3%, to 7063, led by precious metals producers and defensive stocks including ITV, Whitbread and Tui Travel. Mining stocks, and banks, led the fallers. Across Europe, Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB weakened by 0.5% as investors braced for the country\u2019s biggest banking bailout in many years, while the German DAX lost 0.2% and the French CAC closed flat. Meanwhile on Wall Street, the Dow Jones has slipped a little deeper into the red, and a little further from the 20,000 point milestone. Robert O\u2019Daly of The Economist Intelligence Unit agrees that Monte dei Paschi is heading for a state rescue, now that its attempt to raise \u20ac5bn from private investors has faltered. He also predicts that populist parties could get an electoral boost, if more banks require government help. O\u2019Daly writes: We expect the state to approve the MPS board\u2019s request to inject capital. This will require a bail-in of junior bondholders, though the state may move to compensate retail bondholders. The government is putting in place a \u20ac20bn fund to shore up MPS and other weak banks. More broadly, we believe that addressing Italy\u2019s banking woes would be manageable from an economic standpoint, as market estimates place the costs of cleaning up the banks\u2019 bad loans at 2.5% of GDP or less. If mishandled, MPS\u2019s recapitalisation and future efforts to address other problematic banks could further inflate populist rhetoric at Italy\u2019s next national election campaign, following the boon for anti-establishment parties provided by the resounding \u201cno\u201d vote at the referendum. Over in New York, the US stock market has opened with barely a grunt. The Dow Jones industrial average has dipped by 8 points in muted trading, to 19,933. That takes it away from its record highs, and further way from the much-obsessed about 20,000 mark. Back to Monte dei Paschi.... and the Financial Times also reckons that the bank\u2019s board will meet later today to discuss their next move,. With MPS\u2019s capital raising push now over, the FT says: According to people close to the matter, the Italian cabinet will meet to approve the bailout of MPS late on Thursday or early on Friday, after the MPS board has requested help. The MPS board was not expected to make any statement until after the end of trading on Thursday, those people said. The FT also reports that Rome\u2019s government will try to protect small bondholders, if there is a bailout: Due to EU rules designed to limit the hit to taxpayers, the government rescue will impose losses on MPS shareholders and junior bondholders, making them share some of the financial burden. Italian officials said that they would move to compensate some of the 40,000 MPS retail bondholders who might take a hit, though institutional investors would not be spared. \u201cThe scheme is ready\u201d, said one senior Italian official. \u201cThe burden-sharing principle will be respected but we will try to limit the damage to savers as much as possible. Breaking news from America: the world\u2019s largest economy grew even faster than previously thought in the third quarter of 2016. US GDP expanded by an annual rate of 3.5% in the July-to-September period, up from a previous estimate of 3.2%. That\u2019s the equivalent of a quarterly growth rate of around 0.85% -- much faster than Britain\u2019s 0.5% growth in the same period. This shows that America\u2019s economy is growing at the fastest pace in two years, driven by a 3% rise in consumer spending, a 10% jump in exports, and a rise in companies restocking their inventories: There\u2019s a flurry of other economic data flashing across my terminal too, including the news that New orders for US-made capital goods (heavy-duty machinery, electronics) jumped by 0.9% last month (excluding aircraft sales). The number of new claims for unemployment benefit hit a six-month high of 275,000 last week. The clocks in Siena have chimed two o\u2019clock, which means that Monte dei Paschi\u2019s attempt to raise \u20ac5bn from private investors has officially ended. Unless something remarkable happened in the last few hours, MPS will have failed to hit its target. As we flagged up this morning, MPS had only managed to raise \u20ac2bn, once the Qatar sovereign wealth fund declined to back the plan last night. One insider tells us that the Monte dei Paschi board will now meet to plan their next move. They could decide to ask Italy\u2019s government for assistance tonight, to help the bank reach its \u20ac5bn target. Any rescue plan could also force losses on investors who hold MPS bonds; under European banking rules, these bondholders must be \u2018bailed in\u2019, before the state can help. But the Italian government will be keen to avoid penalising the retail investors (individuals, families, small businesses...) who hold debt issued by the world\u2019s oldest bank..... So they could look to find a way of compensating them (one theory is that anyone holding less than \u20ac100,000 of bonds is protected, as with retail savings accounts). Monte dei Paschi isn\u2019t the only Italian bank in a fix. Economists estimate that Italy\u2019s banking sector needs more than \u20ac50bn in fresh capital, to help it tackle its bad debts. Unicredit, the country\u2019s largest bank, got the ball rolling with a \u20ac13bn cash call last week, but many other lenders have not yet acted. This chart from Bloomberg shows how the \u20ac20bn set aside by the Italian government this week might not be enough: Mihir Kapadia, CEO and Founder of Sun Global Investments, argues that the sector needs deep-rooted reforms, as well as fresh capital. He writes: \u201cShares of Monte dei Paschi di Siena have fallen further as efforts to raise private capital failed at the eleventh hour. With Qatar\u2019s sovereign wealth fund pulling out from the \u20ac5bn cash call, the bank now needs a state bailout to stay afloat. Under the current scenario of low interest rates, massive fines and negligible earnings, the reluctance of the private investors to take on such weak structures is understandable. The Italian parliament has vowed to inject more than \u20ac20bn into the bank, in order to prevent a collapse which would have far reaching consequences. If the bank fails, there are strong fears that its collapse could pull down much of the country\u2019s bad debt ridden banking sector with it. The bank had been named as the weakest lender in Europe because of billions of euros of risky loans, failing the EU stress test in July this year. Given this, the Italian government\u2019s efforts cannot end with simple state support, but rather large-scale banking reforms and stringent policy measures are needed. Unless this is achieved a banking crisis looks almost inevitable. This is not just a threat to Italy, but for the larger Eurozone, the euro and the region\u2019s political future.\u201d Electric carmaker Tesla has become the latest firm to raise the cost of its products in the UK, in response to the pound\u2019s decline this year. The company told some UK showrooms that prices will go up at the start of next month. In an email, Tesla said: We have just received some information that we need to share with you \u2013 due to currency fluctuations we will be increasing our UK prices for custom orders by 5% on 1 January 2017.\u201d \u201cPrices on showroom and pre-owned cars will remain fixed at current prices.\u201d More here: The fog has now lifted in London, but there\u2019s little else to report from the City. After three hours of trading, Europe\u2019s financial markets still seem becalmed, as people wait for Monte dei Paschi\u2019s cash call to formally end after lunchtime (2pm in Italy, or 1pm GMT). Some investors are hopeful that the saga will soon end. As LC Macro Advisors head, Lorenzo Codogno, explains (via Reuters):. \u201cThis situation has dragged on for years without a clear solution. Now a solution is in sight. My perception is that the government backstop will be welcomed by financial markets and it will be a plus for the (Italian) economy as well.\u201d But Mike van Dulken, head of research at Accendo Markets, isn\u2019t pleased that a rescue might take three whole months (see earlier post): Risk appetite remains hampered by thinner holiday trading into Christmas as well as talk of a Monte dei Paschi bailout taking a whopping 3-months to complete, taking us well beyond a supposed 31 Dec deadline for shoring up Italy\u2019s knackered banks. An official announcement still eludes markets which understandably want clarity on the issue. The Financial Times flag up that some Monte dei Paschi savers have been taking money out of the bank in recent months, as its funding crisis accelerated. More here (\u00a3). Toby Nangle, top multi-asset manager at Columbia Threadneedle, isn\u2019t convinced that the Treasury Committee\u2019s new inquiry into the Bank of England will crack the mysteries of monetary policy. After all, the BoE does devote plenty of time to assessing whether its measures are working. So MPs (or their staffers) may find themselves wading through long, competing theories about how interest rates and quantitative easing works. Toby tweets: But...economist Shaun Richards is encouraged that MPs have launched an inquiry into the BoE\u2019s work: Newsflash from London: A group of influential MPs have just launched an inquiry into the effectiveness of Britain\u2019s monetary policy since the financial crisis struck. The Treasury committee will investigate whether the Bank of England was right to slash interest rates to record lows, and buy up hundreds of billions of government bonds with new money. They will examine whether this policy has actually worked, what impact it has had on savers, house prices and struggling companies, and whether policymakers are now out of ammunition to fight the next crisis. The move follows growing criticism of the Bank\u2019s actions in the crisis, most notably from prime minister Theresa May. The BoE, though, insists that it has acted sensibly to protect the economy and preserve jobs. Committee chairman Andrew Tyrie explains why MPs are now taking action: Interest rates are stuck near zero, the Bank of England has used increasingly unconventional forms of quantitative easing, and inflation has been below the two per cent target for three years. \u201cThe efficacy of monetary policy or otherwise, its unintended consequences, and its prospects, need careful examination. \u201cThe Treasury Committee will continue to act as a safeguard on the operational independence of the Bank. The Treasury indemnity, which underpins parts of the Bank\u2019s monetary policy, could all too easily encourage the Treasury, or politicians, to put undue pressure on the Bank. The Committee will examine the risks of that, too.\u201d Here are the terms of reference for the inquiry: The effectiveness of monetary policy in meeting the inflation target: The effectiveness of holding Bank rate near zero and whether extremely low rates can encourage more, rather than less, saving The effectiveness of quantitative easing and whether it has met with diminishing returns The scope for further expansion of \u201cqualitative easing\u201d (e.g. corporate bond purchases) Whether forward guidance effectively binds the Bank to a policy course, and the desirability of doing so The unintended consequences of monetary policy The impact on asset-price inflation, the housing market and financial stability The implications for the long-term sustainability of pensions and savings income The distributional impact The impact on competition, \u201czombie companies\u201d and productivity The effects on the structure of relative prices in capital and commodity markets and the consequences for capital allocation, productivity and the trade cycle The implications of a large balance sheet and the Treasury indemnity for Bank accountability and its relationship with the government and other agencies The use of macro-prudential, fiscal and other policy to counterbalance any unintended consequences of monetary policy The prospects for monetary policy The drivers behind and prospects for low real interest rates in the UK and globally What is the significance for monetary policy of rises in bond yields since the US election? The impact and trade-offs of tightening monetary policy in the near-term Whether monetary policy is currently out of ammunition for the next crisis Options for raising the \u201cnatural rate\u201d of interest (e.g. fiscal policy, promoting investment) Scrap what we said about MPS buyers being in short supply -- its shares are now up 3% on the day. At this stage in proceedings, and with prices so low, we probably shouldn\u2019t read too much into it. Monte dei Paschi\u2019s shares are having one of those mornings; they\u2019ve already been suspended once, after plunging over 6%: Europe\u2019s stock markets have dipped into the red in early, subdued trading. There\u2019s no sign of the traditional \u201cSanta Rally\u201d yet; perhaps it has been lost in the fog gripping London this morning. Connor Campbell of SpreadEx sums up the mood: Once again the main news surrounded Monte dei Paschi. With the world\u2019s oldest bank rapidly running out of time to raise the \u20ac5 billion in capital it desperately needs \u2013 it\u2019s only managed \u20ac2 billion so far, with a key Qatari investors choosing not to invest a \u20ac1 billion chunk \u2013 it looks like MPS will be forced into a government bailout. Italy approved a \u20ac20 billion increase to its debt ceiling yesterday, freeing up money for its ailing banks, starting with Monte dei Paschi. This news has begun to drag on the rest of the European banking sector, with the likes of Deutsche Bank, Barclays and Lloyds all dipping their toes into the red after the bell. This in turn capped the region\u2019s indices, with the DAX and CAC falling 0.1% and 0.2% respectively. Update: Shares in Monte Dei Paschi have finally opened, and they\u2019re down 6.75% at \u20ac15.20. They\u2019ve already shed more than 99% of their value in the last decade, as this graph from blogger Jeroen Blokland shows: Shares in Monte dei Paschi have failed to open at the start of trading in Milan. Buyers may be in short supply today, as they risk being wiped out if the Italian state has to bail the bank out  . Italian newspaper Il Sole 24 is reporting that the rescue of Monte Dei Paschi might take two or three months. The paper says that the details haven\u2019t been worked out yet, but that MPS would initially be able to tap state guarantees to bolster its liquidity. That would help MPS avoid running out of cash, now that Qatar has declined to back its \u20ac5bn cash call. A long-term recapitalisation plan would take longer; and involve MPS\u2019s management presenting a new business plan. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Monte dei Paschi di Siena has been through a lot since it was founded back in 1472, twenty years before Columbus discovered America. And the world\u2019s oldest bank finds itself in the undignified position of needing a bailout this morning, after efforts to persuade private investors to provide desperately needed fresh capital floundered. Monte dei Paschi di Siena admitted last night that Qatar\u2019s sovereign wealth fund had not been persuaded to become the \u201canchor investor\u201d to underpin its \u20ac5bn cash call. So a saga that has been dragging on for months could finally be resolved today, when the cash call closes at lunchtime today. Without private sector capital, MPS is now likely to miss an end of year deadline imposed by the European Central Bank to raise fresh funds. So the Italian government is now under serious time pressure to step in and put in fresh capital itself. As we wrote last night, MPS is running out of time and options. Shares in the bank, Italy\u2019s third largest, gyrated wildly in Wednesday\u2019s trading session, plunging 18% to record lows before closing 12% lower amid rumours that the fund-raising effort would fail. \u201cThe idea that Qatar could be an anchor investor has vanished and without an anchor investor there is no demand from anyone else,\u201d one source told Reuters. In the last few minutes, the bank reported that it had only raised \u20ac2bn in new capital through the debt-for-equity swap, far short of the \u20ac5bn target. Yesterday, Italy\u2019s government prepared for a rescue bid by approving a \u20ac20bn fund for bank recapitalisation. Ministers have also insisted that there will be a \u201cminimised or non-existent\u201d impact on savers. But shareholders, and those who hold MPS\u2019s junior, and riskier, bonds could suffer losses. Also coming up today The Dow Jones industrial average will have another tilt at smashing through the 20,000 point mark, after faltering and falling back from record highs yesterday. We get a flurry of US economic data, including new personal consumption and durable goods orders at 1.30pm GMT, plus the latest weekly jobless report -- and a new estimate of American growth in the last quarter. And rumours continue to swirl that Deutsche Bank might be close to a settlement with the Department of Justice, over misconduct before the 2008 financial crisis.",

The shares \u2013 down 85% this year \u2013 slumped by 7.5%. MPS is under instruction from the European Central Bank to bolster its finances after it was the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jul/29/rescue-package-in-place-as-europes-oldest-bank-fails-stress-tests\">weakest of 51 European banks subjected to stress tests</a>.</p> <p>The inability to convince Qatar to put in up to \u20ac1bn is expected to lead the bank\u2019s board to concede it would not be able to secure a solution to its capital gap without the Italian government. This means <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/italy\">Italy</a> would have to impose losses on bondholders before it could stump up cash because of new EU rules intended to stop taxpayers having to pick up the bill for bank losses.</p> <p>However, about \u20ac2bn of the bonds are held by private investors and there are expectations that an arrangement would be put in place to limit their losses.</p> <p>The Italian cabinet is expected to convene on Thursday to discuss its options for protecting retail investors and to try to limit its eventual stake in the bank to below 50%.</p> <p>The bailout is not just a financial issue. It is also expected to have political consequences for Italy\u2019s controlling Democratic party and Matteo Renzi, the former prime minister who <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/dec/11/italy-paolo-gentiloni-to-succeed-matteo-renzi-as-prime-minister\">stepped down from office earlier this month</a> after he was roundly defeated in the 4 December referendum. Paolo Gentiloni has taken over as prime minister for now, but Renzi is expected to run for election again as early as next year.</p> <p>Wolfango Piccoli, an analyst with Teneo Intelligence, said a government rescue might not be immediately damaging politically, in large part because public attention will be diverted from the issue during the Christmas period. But the issue could become \u201cpolitically toxic\u201d later, once it becomes clear how many of the bank\u2019s junior bondholders are eventually compensated for their losses, and how long it takes for them to be paid....<br></p> <p> Piccoli said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\u201cIn terms of the junior bondholders, let\u2019s see what happens. it will eventually be decided by Brussels,\u201d</p> </blockquote> <p>Once MPS is saved, a number of other banks could also require government support, keeping the issue in the news for the foreseeable future.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\u201cThis will drag on for some time.

With Qatar\u2019s sovereign wealth fund pulling out from the \u20ac5bn cash call, the bank now needs a state bailout to stay afloat. Under the current scenario of low interest rates, massive fines and negligible earnings, the reluctance of the private investors to take on such weak structures is understandable. The Italian parliament has vowed to inject more than \u20ac20bn into the bank, in order to prevent a collapse which would have far reaching consequences. If the bank fails, there are strong fears that its collapse could pull down much of the country\u2019s bad debt ridden banking sector with it.</p> <p>The bank had been named as the weakest lender in Europe because of billions of euros of risky loans, failing the EU stress test in July this year. Given this, the Italian government\u2019s efforts cannot end with simple state support, but rather large-scale banking reforms and stringent policy measures are needed. Unless this is achieved a banking crisis looks almost inevitable. This is not just a threat to Italy, but for the larger Eurozone, the euro and the region\u2019s political future.\u201d</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-585bbf20e4b0966513aeca64\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-12-22T12:12:22.436Z\">12.12pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Weak pound prompts Tesla to hike prices in UK</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"2c5d25aa5cef280c17e2d935f39d8842f8768bdd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2c5d25aa5cef280c17e2d935f39d8842f8768bdd/232_187_3558_2135/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A Tesla Model S electric car.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p><strong>Electric carmaker Tesla has become the latest firm to raise the cost of its products in the UK, in response to the pound\u2019s decline this year.</strong></p> <p>The company told some UK showrooms that prices will go up at the start of next month.</p> <p>In an email, Tesla said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We have just received some information that we need to share with you \u2013 due to currency fluctuations we will be increasing our UK prices for custom orders by 5% on 1 January 2017.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cPrices on showroom and pre-owned cars will remain fixed at current prices.\u201d</p> </blockquote> <p>More here:</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/dec/22/tesla-uk-prices-new-year-currency-brexit-vote\">Tesla to hike UK prices by 5% in the new year</a> </p> </aside> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-585bb0f1e4b0d460757eb76c\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-12-22T11:05:33.260Z\">11.05am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>The fog has now lifted in London, but there\u2019s little else to report from the City. </strong></p> <p>After three hours of trading, Europe\u2019s financial markets still seem becalmed, as people wait for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2016/dec/22/italys-monte-dei-paschi-bailout-rescue-bid-business-live?page=with:block-585b7be6e4b06265ff0d5a1b#block-585b7be6e4b06265ff0d5a1b\">Monte dei Paschi\u2019s cash call to formally end after lunchtime</a> (2pm in Italy, or 1pm GMT).<br></p> <p>Some investors are hopeful that the saga will soon end.

With central-government austerity policies (Cuts at catastrophic level, says Birmingham council chief, 13 December), they are now all vanishing, or hard-pressed local volunteers are struggling to deal with community-asset transfer, taking over the running and the management of such amenities, if they are not sold off to unaccountable private companies. The latest proposal from Bradford metropolitan district council is to pass many of its local halls over to local groups, should they be willing and able to take on this community-asset transfer. Our Silsden town hall is on the list. We will fight to retain it as it has been run over the past two years: with a local volunteer Friends group working hard to encourage use of the town hall (which is a fine, historic building in the heart of the former mill town), but with the council paying for the upkeep and staffing. This arrangement has been working very satisfactorily, the hall almost cost-neutral. I rejoice much less now as I go through the local park. This has happened in the last few years.

Shares in Weight Watchers jumped by almost a fifth on Thursday following the news that the broadcasting titan had lost 18kg (40lb) by following the company\u2019s latest guidance. A new advertising campaign showed Winfrey urging viewers to \u201ctake the leap\u201d, as she clinked wine glasses with friends over spaghetti and salad. \u201cSince I started Weight Watchers, I\u2019ve lost over 40lb.

Investors lapped up the message and sent Weight Watchers shares soaring by 18% to $12.35, their biggest move in 10 months. The ads are due to air on US television and social media from 26 December, a time when potential customers will be looking to burn off their Christmas calories. Weight Watchers has suffered in recent years as consumers have moved away from diet programmes, in favour of healthier eating, calorie-counting apps and activity trackers such as FitBit. Shares hit a one-year low of below $10 in September after the chief executive, James Chambers, resigned. They soared to $26 after Winfrey bought her stake in the firm 14 months ago.",

      "bodyText": "Supermarkets are braced for their busiest day of the year on Friday, with shoppers expected to spend nearly \u00a3900m on groceries for the Christmas break. Tesco, the UK\u2019s biggest supermarket, is expecting 10 million shoppers and to sell one-third of its Christmas turkeys, as 200,000 customers buy their birds and turkey crowns in one day. Sainsbury\u2019s said its busiest shopping period would start at about 12pm. Although many people make last-minute purchases on Christmas Eve, traditionally the number of shoppers out and about the day before Christmas is one-fifth lower than on 23 December. But with Christmas Day falling on a Sunday, potentially leaving time for a full day of shopping on Christmas Eve, retailers are expecting to be busy. The number of shoppers visiting the UK\u2019s high streets and shopping centres was down 7.7% last week, according to shopper tracking company Springboard, and retailers are holding their breath for a final dash to stores. Waitrose, which announced a 1.7% drop in sales last week on the same period last year, said many shoppers were holding off to make their big purchases later. It expects takings to be three-and-a-half times higher than on a normal Friday. Grocers that focus on premium quality foods usually grab a bigger share of the market at Christmas. Marks &amp; Spencer, which typically accounts for 3% of UK grocery spend, sells one-quarter of all festive turkeys. In the past few years, discounters Aldi and Lidl have taken a bigger slice of the Christmas pie by tempting shoppers with luxury foods such as lobster and champagne at bargain prices. This year, the major supermarkets have fought back, with Asda offering seasonal packs of vegetables such as carrots and potatoes for 20p, and Lidl slashing its price to 19p to undercut Tesco\u2019s 39p packs, which were a hit last year. Meanwhile, Iceland, which has struggled in recent years, has been seeing strong growth. Malcolm Walker, the chief executive of the supermarket, said: \u201cWe are on a roll, with everything going well.\u201d He said Friday is expected to be the chain\u2019s best Christmas sales day since its launch more than 40 years ago. Meanwhile, the rise of next day delivery and click and collect is also encouraging shoppers to leave things later than in previous years. Online retailers are offering some of their latest order dates in history. Fashion website Asos says shoppers who order before 8pm on Friday will get their gifts ahead of Christmas Day and Debenhams is promising click and collect next day delivery to stores for orders made before 9pm on Friday. M&amp;S and Next shoppers must order by Thursday night in order to get their gifts on time, although the latter is promising shoppers a refund and gift card if it does not meet its delivery promise.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "A long, hard look at the way the Bank of England has conducted monetary policy since 2008 is long overdue so the announcement by the Treasury select committee that it is launching an inquiry into ultra-low interest rates, quantitative easing and forward guidance is welcome. It is worth recalling that when Threadneedle Street slashed the cost of borrowing to 0.5% and began using asset purchases to print money both were seen as temporary measures to deal with an immediate crisis. The UK economy is no longer collapsing as it was during the winter of 2008-09 but unconventional monetary policy has become a permanent fixture. Indeed, the aftermath of the Brexit vote saw the Bank cut interest rates still further to 0.25% and increase the size of its QE programme. The measures taken during the slump were appropriate at the time. Low interest rates were designed to reduce borrowing costs for companies and individuals, and to persuade them to spend rather than save. Quantitative easing was a way in which central banks could counteract the sharp contraction in private credit creation by commercial banks. But that was eight years ago. As Claudio Borio, the head of the monetary and economics department at the Bank for International Settlements, noted back in 2011, the certainties of the \u201cGreat Moderation\u201d \u2013 the pre-crisis years when growth was strong and inflation stable \u2013 are gone. Central banks, Borio noted, were sailing in uncharted waters. There are three big charges that Mark Carney will face when he gives evidence to the Treasury committee. The first is that monetary policy has only really worked by raising asset prices, and by doing so has widened the gap between those who own shares and houses and those that don\u2019t. The Bank has always argued that the poor would have been even worse off had it not slashed interest rates and used QE, because the recession would have been deeper and unemployment higher. The second charge is that unconventional monetary policy has led to misallocation of capital on a grand scale. One explanation for the UK\u2019s woeful productivity record since the financial crisis is that too many poorly-performing companies have survived courtesy of ultra-low interest rates while growing firms have been starved of investment. Finally, and perhaps most importantly, there is the charge that by keeping unconventional measures in place for too long, the Bank of England has helped create the conditions for the next crisis and will lack the firepower to deal with it when it comes. Whether the inquiry leads to any changes in policy remains to be seen. It certainly should. Monetary policy has been hyperactive while fiscal policy \u2013 tax and spending \u2013 has been sucking demand out of the economy. The theory behind austerity was that monetary stimulus would generate the growth and the tax revenues to enable the government to fix the hole in the public finances. Instead of taking advantage of historically low interest rates to borrow for much-needed public investment, George Osborne relied on the Bank to stimulate growth through private borrowing. The conclusion the select committee should reach is that this unbalanced approach didn\u2019t work last time and it won\u2019t work next time either.",

      "body": "<p>A long, hard look at the way the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/bankofenglandgovernor\">Bank of England </a>has conducted monetary policy since 2008 is long overdue so the announcement by the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/dec/22/mps-bank-of-england-low-interest-rates-treasury-select-committee\">Treasury select committee that it is launching an inquiry </a>into ultra-low interest rates, quantitative easing and forward guidance is welcome.</p> <p>It is worth recalling that when Threadneedle Street slashed the cost of borrowing to 0.5% and began using asset purchases to print money both were seen as temporary measures to deal with an immediate crisis.</p> <p>The UK economy is no longer collapsing as it was during the winter of 2008-09 but unconventional monetary policy has become a permanent fixture. Indeed, the aftermath of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/eu-referendum\">Brexit</a> vote saw the Bank cut interest rates still further to 0.25% and increase the size of its QE programme.</p> <p>The measures taken during the slump were appropriate at the time. Low interest rates were designed to reduce borrowing costs for companies and individuals, and to persuade them to spend rather than save. Quantitative easing was a way in which central banks could counteract the sharp contraction in private credit creation by commercial banks.</p> <p>But that was eight years ago. As Claudio Borio, the head of the monetary and economics department at the Bank for International Settlements, <a href=\"http://www.bis.org/publ/work353.htm\">noted back in 2011</a>, the certainties of the \u201cGreat Moderation\u201d \u2013 the pre-crisis years when growth was strong and inflation stable \u2013 are gone. Central banks, Borio noted, were sailing in uncharted waters.</p> <p>There are three big charges that Mark Carney will face when he gives evidence to the Treasury committee. The first is that monetary policy has only really worked by raising asset prices, and by doing so has widened the gap between those who own shares and houses and those that don\u2019t. The Bank has always argued that the poor would have been even worse off had it not slashed interest rates and used QE, because the recession would have been deeper and unemployment higher.</p> <p>The second charge is that unconventional monetary policy has led to misallocation of capital on a grand scale. One explanation for the UK\u2019s woeful productivity record since the financial crisis is that too many poorly-performing companies have survived courtesy of ultra-low interest rates while growing firms have been starved of investment.</p> <p>Finally, and perhaps most importantly, there is the charge that by keeping unconventional measures in place for too long, the Bank of England has helped create the conditions for the next crisis and will lack the firepower to deal with it when it comes.</p> <p>Whether the inquiry leads to any changes in policy remains to be seen. It certainly should. Monetary policy has been hyperactive while fiscal policy \u2013 tax and spending \u2013 has been sucking demand out of the economy.</p> <p>The theory behind austerity was that monetary stimulus would generate the growth and the tax revenues to enable the government to fix the hole in the public finances. Instead of taking advantage of historically low interest rates to borrow for much-needed public investment, George Osborne relied on the Bank to stimulate growth through private borrowing. The conclusion the select committee should reach is that this unbalanced approach didn\u2019t work last time and it won\u2019t work next time either.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The Bank of England\u2019s policy of near zero interest rates since the 2008 financial crash is to come under scrutiny by MPs in a far-reaching probe that could lead to calls for changes to the central bank\u2019s remit, it was announced on Thursday. The influential Treasury select committee said it would also examine the damage to the Bank\u2019s reputation from attacks on governor Mark Carney by senior politicians. The review comes after Theresa May\u2019s comments at the Tory conference that low interest rates and the \u00a3435bn programme of purchasing government bonds, known as quantitative easing, had \u201cbad side-effects\u201d, sparking concerns that ministers wanted to bring the central bank back under Treasury control. May said she was concerned that \u201cjust managing\u201d families were suffering from policies devised in Threadneedle Street that increased inequality. Newspaper articles and comments that followed by former ministers and pro-Brexit campaigners Michael Gove and Nigel Lawson, and the Eurosceptic former Conservative party leader William Hague, appeared to be part of a co-ordinated assault on Carney and prompted the bank governor to say last month that politicians had embarked on a \u201cmassive blame-deflection exercise\u201d. Most economic forecasts predict that the UK\u2019s slowing economy will force the Bank to stick with its current policies of rock-bottom rates for another year, angering powerful lobby groups of pensioners that have complained about receiving meagre returns on their savings. Andrew Tyrie, the Tory MP who chairs the committee, said he also wanted to investigate the \u201cunintended consequences\u201d of maintaining the bank\u2019s base rate at 0.25% and how much it had increased the incentive for households to put extra money aside. Seven years of government bond purchases by the bank, which amount to \u00a3435bn, will also be questioned by MPs. Tyrie said the committee wanted to consider the stimulating effect on the economy of extending the bond buying programme to corporate bonds. \u201cInterest rates are stuck near zero, the Bank of England has used increasingly unconventional forms of quantitative easing, and inflation has been below the 2% target for three years,\u201d he said. \u201cThe efficacy of monetary policy or otherwise, its unintended consequences, and its prospects, need careful examination.\u201d Tyrie said he was concerned about the series of attacks on the Bank and wanted to consider further safeguards to protect its independence He said: \u201cThe Treasury committee will continue to act as a safeguard on the operational independence of the Bank. The Treasury indemnity, which underpins parts of the Bank\u2019s monetary policy, could all too easily encourage the Treasury, or politicians, to put undue pressure on the Bank.\u201d The review is likely to dismay Carney, who has assured Tyrie and MPs on the committee on several occasions that the monetary policy committee, which he chairs, has considered all the consequences of its actions and followed the only path open to it. Some thinktanks urged Carney to raise interest rates in 2014 once the UK economy began to recover strongly from the banking crash. But a succession of shocks, including the recent Brexit vote result, have persuaded Carney and the nine-strong MPC to reject these calls and inject further funds to stimulate the economy. In August, following a panicky reaction to the Brexit vote by businesses and consumers, the Bank cut the base rate from 0.5% and added another \u00a360bn to its quantitative easing programme. Threadneedle Street has come under fire from pensioner groups and savers who argue that it has favoured borrowers over savers by keeping interest rates low. The committee said it wants to test how much savers have found themselves pumping even greater funds into their pensions and savings plans to make up for the lost interest, possibly depressing consumer spending and business investment as a result. Deputy governor Ben Broadbent said the bank\u2019s analysis showed that while savers had experienced lower interest rates since 2008, the value of their assets had been protected by the bank\u2019s policies. Broadbent said a long spell of ultra-low interest rates had not caused a rise in inequality in the UK, explaining in his speech that, given most income came from wages and not assets, low rates had not encouraged a rise in income inequality. Furthermore, in the case of assets, there was little effect on inequality from loose monetary policy, he said. \u2022 This article was amended on 23 December 2016. An earlier version said incorrectly that William Hague was a pro-Brexit campaigner; although a Eurosceptic, he supported a remain vote in the EU referendum.",

The US firm\u2019s UK showrooms were informed of the decision earlier this week and staff have been contacting prospective customers to warn them about the imminent price hikes. One email seen by the Guardian states: \u201cWe have just received some information that we need to share with you \u2013 due to currency fluctuations we will be increasing our UK prices for custom orders by 5% on 1 January 2017.\u201d It also states: \u201cPrices on showroom and pre-owned cars will remain fixed at current prices.\u201d In the six months since the vote for Brexit retailers and manufacturers have signalled the weakness of sterling will push up prices in 2017 as the cost of importing goods increases. The pound has lost more than 15% of its value against the dollar since the Brexit vote. Fashion retailer Next has said its clothing prices will rise by up to 5% while electrical goods retailers Dixons Carphone and AO have also said their suppliers want to charge more. Apple has pushed up the price of every computer in its range, while Microsoft and Dell have also signalled that price hikes are on the way. Tesla\u2019s main base of operations and factory is in California but it has a European base in Amsterdam and a distribution centre in Tilburg in the Netherlands. A Tesla spokesperson said: \u201c\u2018Due to currency fluctuations, we will be increasing our UK prices by 5% on 1 January 2017.\u201d It is understood that this means prices for both Model S and Model X will increase on 1 January. Last month its chief executive Elon Musk announced plans to expand its European operations by building a second \u201cgigafactory\u201d battery production plant and an automated manufacturing research centre. The expansion follows the purchase of German firm Grohmann Engineering which specialises in automated assembly systems serving the automotive, telecommunications, consumer electronics and biotechnology industries. Tesla did not confirm the timescale for building Gigafactory 2 in Europe with Musk stating it would do so after production of its Model 3 was under way. At that time Tesla said it had taken 370,000 pre-orders of its more affordable Model 3, which will sell for about $35,000 (\u00a328,263) and is expected to start being delivered in 2017 with full production in 2018. Until now, mid- and high-capacity models of the company\u2019s Model S and Model X cars have come with free access to Tesla\u2019s network of superchargers, which are capable of putting a half-charge into a car\u2019s batteries within 30 minutes. But it has already announced plans to start charging for this service in January.",

      "bodyText": "When Mike Coupe took over from his showier former boss Justin King as Sainsbury\u2019s chief executive in 2014, just as the group\u2019s nine year-long stretch of sales growth was coming to an end, many industry observers believed he had been handed one of the biggest turkeys in the business. The rise of discounters Aldi and Lidl forced all of the big four grocers, including Sainsbury\u2019s, to slash profits to fund price cuts just as they had to close stores which were surplus to requirements thanks to the rise of online shopping. However, two-and-a-half years on, despite a slight drift down in market share, Sainsbury\u2019s has more or less held its own helping it to steal back its position as the UK\u2019s second largest grocer from a shrinking Asda. Coupe reckons it is now the discounters on the back foot. \u201cThey are under pressure and it\u2019s more challenging for them,\u201d Coupe says. He says the major chains have all narrowed the price gap with Aldi and Lidl in the past year and, even where the gap hasn\u2019t closed, the discounters have been forced to compress their already slim profit margins to maintain their price lead. Sainsbury\u2019s has already spent more than \u00a3150m on cutting prices in the past two years. The Christmas meal has proved a significant battleground: last year, Tesco stole a march on the discounters with cheap seasonal veg and this year Sainsbury\u2019s claims it has the cheapest turkeys on the market at \u00a33.50 a kg. Sainsbury\u2019s is also investing in developing product areas where it believes it can differentiate itself from the discounters such as ready meals, prepared fruit or the fast growing gluten and dairy free foods. It has already revamped 3,000 food products, a move which it also hopes will help it fight back against the expansion of Waitrose and Marks &amp; Spencer, which has impinged on Sainsbury\u2019s comfortable position as the handiest place to buy quality food. This year, 25% of its Christmas products are new and hundreds more items will be revamped next year. Sainsbury\u2019s has already spent \u00a360m on improving the quality of its products including \u00a39m on its takeaway food ranges. Introducing options such as porridge and cold pressed juices and improving basics by, for example, using tomatoes that will not make its sandwiches soggy, has helped to boost sales. Coupe says the strategy is working but it\u2019s still tough. \u201cWe have seen a significant refocusing of the mainstream supermarkets on the discounters and that\u2019s undoubtedly dampened their growth. But they are still growing because they are opening lots of shops and the threat isn\u2019t going to go away,\u201d he says. Some argue that, given the tough environment, Coupe should be focusing on the food business, but he believes the future is in branching out. Coupe, who after stints at nearly every major grocer was seen as a safe pair of hands after the showmanship of King, has proved to be even more ambitious and bold than his predecessor. Always more interested in online retailing than King, Coupe has invested \u00a31.4bn in buying Argos, the catalogue shop which makes half of its sales online and specialises in high speed deliveries. \u201cI believe there is a significant opportunity in clothing and general merchandise. That market is unconsolidated and where we have relatively small market share and an opportunity for financial services,\u201d he says. Coupe\u2019s strategy hinges on the three divisions of Sainsbury\u2019s \u2013 its supermarkets, bank and Argos, all cross selling their goods and services to each other\u2019s client base while reducing central costs. \u201cIt\u2019s the three businesses together that gives the group more flexibility, more resources and more ability to compete,\u201d he says. After an \u201coperationally successful\u201d Black Friday last month, the biggest sales day of the year for Argos, Coupe says he is more confident than ever about the buyout. About 250 Argos outlets will open in Sainsbury\u2019s supermarkets as part of an aim to build destination stores where, along with coffee shops, clothing areas, groceries and other services, they will tempt shoppers away from their computers. The Sainsbury\u2019s Argos stores will be cheaper to operate than those on the high street where analysts believe at least 100 will close. A planned \u00a3160m of synergies from the merger will feed through to the group\u2019s bottom line as promised to the City but Coupe hints there are likely to be further financial benefits to play with. \u201cIf we can generate benefits above \u00a3160m, Sainsbury\u2019s and Argos have options on what we do with that and one of those is price and another is quality or more profitability. All of those are possible and the key thing is to have the options.\u201d Coupe has promised that the combined business will grow its profit margins from 2.5% to as much as 3.5% over the next few years, clawing back the margin lost during the rise of the discounters. But some analysts argue that the Argos acquisition has only exposed Sainsbury\u2019s to more risk and inflationary cost pressures. It sources more goods, such as electrical appliances, priced in dollars from the far east \u2013 which could only increase the pain from potential cost increases caused by the 15% fall in the value of the pound since the Brexit vote. However, Coupe says the bigger group will be more capable of withstanding competitive pressures. It is not just about saving money. In the 10 Sainsbury\u2019s stores where Argos has already opened outlets, grocery sales have been boosted by 1% to 2% while sales the catalogue outlets are seeing growth of more than 20% a year after they opened. Part of the logic for the buyout of Argos is to access its quick delivery service which Sainsbury\u2019s hopes to capitalise on to sell more of its clothing and homewares and, perhaps one day, groceries. Coupe says the tie-up with Argos makes Sainsbury\u2019s better equipped for the future with the likes of Amazon ploughing into the UK grocery market and online food shopping expected to rise 68% over the next five years, according to the IGD industry body. The smartphone has swiftly become the preferred tool for internet shoppers and Coupe says he expects the pace of change to be even more rapid over the next five years as new technologies and ways of shopping emerge. \u201cThe building blocks are in place. Our job is to make stuff happen as we said it would.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 22 December 2016 to correct the price of Sainsbury\u2019s turkeys.",

      "bodyText": "A \u20ac20bn (\u00a317bn) rescue fund for Italy\u2019s banking sector has been approved by the country\u2019s parliament, heralding a bailout of the world\u2019s oldest bank, Monte dei Paschi di Siena (MPS). The bank said late on Wednesday that it had failed to secure an anchor investor \u2013 the Qatar sovereign wealth fund \u2013 for a \u20ac5bn offer of new shares. Despite announcing on Wednesday night that a debt-for-equity swap offer raised slightly over \u20ac2bn \u2013 part of a complex fundraising exercise intended to bolster the strength of the bank \u2013 the failure to persuade a major investor to contribute \u20ac1bn meant the rescue plan would not succeed before it closed at 2pm on Thursday. Shares in the bank, Italy\u2019s third largest, gyrated wildly in Wednesday\u2019s trading session, plunging 18% to record lows before closing 12% lower amid rumours that the fundraising effort would fail. \u201cThe idea that Qatar could be an anchor investor has vanished and without an anchor investor there is no demand from anyone else,\u201d one source told Reuters. With MPS now likely to miss an end-of-year deadline imposed by the European Central Bank to raise fresh funds, the Italian government was expected to step in, possibly as soon as Thursday, and increase its 4% stake in the bank. Led by prime minister, Paolo Gentiloni, the government is now expected to force private investors owning about \u20ac2.1bn of the bank\u2019s bonds to take losses. Gentiloni was propelled into the role after Matteo Renzi resigned following the referendum defeat earlier this month that sparked fresh political turmoil and deterred investors from backing the fundraising. Piercarlo Padoan, the finance minister, told parliament that the government\u2019s proposed \u20ac20bn bailout would have a minimal impact on savers, in comments that sought to assuage the concerns of retail investors. Padoan said: \u201cThis measure reinforces the ability of the Italian system to grow and consolidate itself and this growth will be a further element that helps banks\u2019 balance sheets.\u201d He said that the impact on savers \u201cif there was an intervention, would absolutely be minimised or non-existent\u201d. The implications of a government bailout stretch beyond Italy, the eurozone\u2019s third largest economy which is already running a debt to GDP ratio of more than 130%. It will be a major test of the new EU rules requiring bond holders to take losses before taxpayer money can be injected into banks. It will also be used as barometer for how the government will tackle the problem inside its banking sector, laden down with \u20ac360bn of bad debts. Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at IG, said: \u201cBanking concerns have played across European markets once again today, as Monte dei Paschi looks set for a government takeover. The rescue plan has fallen apart, with Rome unable to find an anchor investor; for understandable reasons, no one wants to be first \u2018over the top\u2019 should the crisis worsen.\u201d The bank was instructed to find more capital after it was the weakest in a health check earlier this year on 51 European banks. Its struggle to boost its capital appeared to have an impact on its day-to-day funding as it warned its liquidity position \u2013 assets it can use immediately \u2013 was falling sharply. By April, it could breach regulatory minimums, reports said. It was not immediately clear how much of the \u20ac20bn approved by the Italian government would be used for MPS, one of many banks which are in need of fresh funds. There were doubts about whether the \u20ac20bn would be a large enough sum to tackle Italy\u2019s problem banks, which have accumulated bad debts as the economy stagnated. Eight years after the financial crisis, economic output remains 8% down on its pre-crash level. Renzi had been attempting to tackle the problem before he resigned after losing the referendum he had called on constitutional reform. He had set up a \u20ac4.25bn backstop fund \u2013 known as Altante \u2013 which was backed by the major lenders and intended to be used to help troubled banks. It has a role in the MPS situation as it was involved in hoovering up bad loans in a clean-up exercise.",

The rescue plan has fallen apart, with Rome unable to find an anchor investor; for understandable reasons, no one wants to be first \u2018over the top\u2019 should the crisis worsen.\u201d</p> <p>The bank was instructed to find more capital<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jul/29/rescue-package-in-place-as-europes-oldest-bank-fails-stress-tests\"> after it was the weakest in a health check earlier this year on 51 European banks</a>. </p> <p>Its struggle to boost its capital appeared to have an impact on its day-to-day funding as it warned its liquidity position \u2013 assets it can use immediately \u2013 was falling sharply. By April, it could breach regulatory minimums, reports said.</p> <p>It was not immediately clear how much of the \u20ac20bn approved by the Italian government would be used for MPS, one of many banks which are in need of fresh funds. There were doubts about whether the \u20ac20bn would be a large enough sum to tackle Italy\u2019s problem banks, which have accumulated bad debts as the economy stagnated. Eight years after the financial crisis, economic output remains 8% down on its pre-crash level.</p> <p>Renzi had been attempting to tackle the problem before he resigned after losing the referendum he had called on constitutional reform. He <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/may/10/battle-prop-up-italy-banks-eu-brexit-grexit-bad-loans\">had set up a \u20ac4.25bn backstop fund \u2013 known as Altante</a> \u2013 which was backed by the major lenders and intended to be used to help troubled banks. It has a role in the MPS situation as it was involved in hoovering up bad loans in a clean-up exercise. </p>",

      "bodyText": "BP has finally officially withdrawn its application to drill for oil in the pristine Great Australian Bight, ending months of uncertainty after it announced it was not pursuing the project but then did not withdraw its application. The Wilderness Society, which has been fighting plans from BP, Chevron, Santos, Murphy Oil and others to create a massive new oil field in the remote waters, described the announcement as an \u201cearly Christmas present\u201d for Australians. \u201cBP\u2019s decision to finally withdraw its risky plans for the bight has given Australians something to really celebrate this Christmas,\u201d said the Wilderness Society\u2019s South Australia director, Peter Owen. The National Offshore Petroleum Safety and Environmental Management Authority (Nopsema) announced on Wednesday night that it had been notified of BP\u2019s withdrawal on Tuesday. BP\u2019s applications had failed to meet Nopsema\u2019s regulatory requirements several times and, in a statement, Nopseama said BP had failed to provide it with more information it needed on several issues including oil spill response plans, environmental monitoring, risks to commonwealth marine reserves and impacts of \u201cplanned emissions and discharges\u201d. The Wilderness Society called for other companies to follow suit. \u201cIf BP with all its experience could not produce an acceptable drilling plan for the regulator, Nopsema, the remaining companies exploring in the bight will be wasting their shareholders\u2019 money trying to pursue this folly,\u201d Owen said. At a Senate inquiry hearing in November, Nopsema\u2019s chief executive said BP\u2019s application was \u201cstill in play\u201d and said if it pursued its application, and received approval, it would be possible for BP to transfer or sell their rights to drill to another company. Nopsema\u2019s announcement ends that speculation but leaves several other applications to drill for oil in the Great Australian Bight progressing as usual. The Great Australian Bight\u2019s pristine waters are home to dozens of species of whales and dolphins, many of which are protected under Australian law. It is often described as the world\u2019s most important nursery for the endangered southern right whales. Oil spill modelling, a summary of which was released by BP, showed that, in a very bad spill, oil could reach as far as New South Wales. The offshore oil industry in the US has been plagued by safety concerns about the bolts used to secure underwater equipment. The US regulator has said the issue is ongoing, with no known solution, and that it is was only a matter of time until a faulty bolt caused a catastrophic spill. Disaster experts from the US and Australia have been highly critical of Australia\u2019s response to those safety concerns.",

      "bodyText": "Britain\u2019s car industry reported record exports in the first 11 months of the year as a combination of the low pound and open access to Europe\u2019s single market boosted sales. UK car exports jumped to 1.25m, the highest ever, after factories put on more shifts and increased overtime to meet the demand for British-made vehicles. The low pound has widely been cited by car makers as a reason for increased demand abroad while others have stressed the need for the UK to maintain zero tariffs and harmonised regulations to aid the steady flow of parts and finished vehicles across Europe. Last week Nissan UK, which employs 7,000 workers at its plant in Sunderland and exports more than 80% of its vehicles, warned that it would be forced to reconsider expanding production in the UK should it face higher shipment costs or restrictions on the supply of vital parts. Mike Hawes, chief executive of UK car industry trade body SMMT, said the car industry\u2019s success could be jeopardised without the current arrangements staying in place. \u201cMade in Britain is a badge coveted by car buyers worldwide, and these latest figures highlight not just that international appeal but the fact that the UK is a globally competitive place to make cars,\u201d he said. \u201cThese latest results are the product of significant investments made over the past few years, but which will continue only if we can maintain the competitive trading conditions that have enabled the UK to become an automotive success story.\u201d The UK car industry\u2019s total production was also strong, reaching a level not seen since 1999 after it climbed 9.6% in the first 11 months to more than 1.6m units. In November the total reached 170,000 vehicles, also a 17-year high. The SMMT said production for the home market was \u201cparticularly strong in November\u201d after rising 14.0% to 33,745 units, a situation that is expected to continue as the cost of imported cars begins to rise in the new year, giving UK-built cars a price advantage. The automotive industry is increasingly seen as a vital part of the UK economy that accounts for more than \u00a371.6bn turnover. \u201cWith some 169,000 people employed directly in manufacturing and 814,000 across the wider automotive industry, it accounts for 12.0% of total UK export of goods and invests \u00a32.5bn each year in automotive R&amp;D,\u201d the organisation said.",
