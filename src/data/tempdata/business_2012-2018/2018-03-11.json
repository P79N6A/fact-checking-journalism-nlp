You\u2019ll recall there was an almighty pile-up at the first hurdle in January, when several veteran riders found themselves unseated during the Presidents Club charity dinner at the Dorchester hotel in Park Lane, central London. There, a steward\u2019s inquiry was convened after a string of \u201chostesses\u201d \u2013 all clad in short, tight black skirts and high heels \u2013 accused the gentlemen of the City of groping, lewd comments and extending invitations to adjourn to hotel bedrooms. Then, in February, a clutch of gambling companies fell at the second after they defied calls from their regulator to stamp out sexism at the industry\u2019s showcase UK event \u2013 the ICE Totally Gaming conference at the Excel centre in the London docklands. The delegates were entertained by pole dancers and a Playboy-themed show, while hostesses claimed to have been harassed and propositioned. Now those who haven\u2019t been gelded enter one of the trickier-looking legs of the whole chase this week, with the property industry assembling in Cannes for its annual boondoggle, called Mipim (March\u00e9 international des professionnels de l\u2019immobilier). Meanwhile, in the UK, the corporate hospitality industry is working itself up into a heightened state of arousal as it prepares to serve copious amounts of Guinness to already well-refreshed stockbrokers attending a paid-for jolly at the Cheltenham festival. The property industry stable is particularly concerned here, following the string of entries it had running under its colours at the Presidents Club. For the sector\u2019s main bash in France, frequent Mipim attendees report that the crowd is typically \u201c90% male\u201d, with some supposedly fond of using the phrase \u201ca rental\u201d to gallantly refer to something other than a tenancy on a new maisonette. Bars and hotel lobbies along La Croisette have previously been reported to be \u201cfull of leggy blondes with broken English and not even a passing interest in real estate yields\u201d. One hotel once supplied its corporate guests with \u201clove boxes\u201d containing condoms, massage oil and scented candles. It is hard to discern what is more clumsy about some of this crowd: their language, their errant hands or their efforts to employ fading O-level French. But, whichever you alight on, you can tell the trade is panicking that its members might be about to let the side down again. As the event organisers reassuringly said in an official statement last month: \u201cUnder no circumstances does Mipim register prostitutes.\u201d Over in the west country, at the other big corporate playground this week, the mood is similarly tense. The event, a huge drinking festival occasionally intertwined with a spot of National Hunt racing, is the sort of place that encourages behaviour that even footballers can feel the need to apologise for. The bookie and race sponsor Sky Bet is attempting to set the tone this year, saying: \u201cWe have long felt the use of walk-in girls for promotional uses has had its day in sport and the time was right to use this exposure opportunity more positively.\u201d And so instead it intends to offer a charity, the Injured Jockeys Fund, the chance of walking in the winner of the first race. Meanwhile, the City firms who will be paying for a lot of the booze are believed to be warning attendees about their conduct. Nothing could possibly go wrong.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "For years Britain has had not one annual budget but two. The real deal \u2013 the one where the chancellor stands outside 11 Downing Street with his little red box \u2013 has been in the spring, but there has also been another round of tax and spending measures included in an autumn statement. Philip Hammond has changed all that. As of now, there will be only one big set-piece event each year and it will be a budget in the late autumn. This week we will see the first spring statement, a pared-down affair in which the chancellor will provide the latest economic and public finance forecasts from the Office for Budget Responsibility, announce some areas for consultation and leave it at that. No tax sweeteners, no extra money for cabinet colleagues pleading for cash, no change to the government\u2019s deficit-reduction approach. Hammond made it clear on the BBC\u2019s Andrew Marr Show that he doesn\u2019t want the spring statement to create too many waves, and there are both political and economic reasons for adopting such an approach. It is less than a year since the last election and unless forced to do so chancellors don\u2019t give money away early in a parliament even if it means alienating voters as a result. As it happens, the polls are not looking too bad for the Conservatives. Hammond certainly has the scope to be generous should he wish to be. Although it is less than four months since the last OBR update on the economy, there have been three developments worthy of note \u2013 all of them helpful to the chancellor. Firstly, growth in 2017 \u2013 while sluggish \u2013 has come in above the OBR\u2019s November forecast of 1.5%. An upgrade to the 1.4% predicted for 2018 also looks likely. Secondly, the public finances look a lot better or, to be more accurate, much less bad than expected last autumn. Back then the OBR was assuming a budget deficit of just shy of \u00a350bn in the current financial year: the actual figure looks like being closer to \u00a340bn. For the first time since the financial crisis, tax receipts are covering day-to-day government spending, which means the Treasury is only borrowing for investment. Finally, no sooner had the OBR slashed its forecasts for productivity than the numbers started to improve, with the final two quarters of 2017 recording output per head rising by 0.8-0.9%. While it is far too early to draw any hard conclusions from such limited data, it is possible the OBR has been a little too gloomy about the long-term productivity outlook. Hammond\u2019s instinct is to bank all these gains, and that would be the case even if he was standing up on Tuesday to deliver a classic spring budget. The chancellor is uncomfortable with a national debt that has more than doubled as a share of annual output (gross domestic product) in the past decade because he knows that sooner or later the economy will have another recession. He would prefer to face that with the debt ratio a lot lower than its current 86% of GDP. Finally, of course, there\u2019s the little matter of Brexit, now little more than a year away. All things considered, the government has been pleasantly surprised by how well the economy has held up since the referendum but accepts that there could be more difficult times ahead. It thinks the economy might be more of need of support in 2019 than it is in 2018. Labour would prefer a bolder approach. The shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, says that austerity has been holding growth back \u2013 an argument backed by the OBR. There is no doubt that the economy would have expanded faster had it not been for the curbs on departmental spending, welfare cuts and tax increases implemented since 2010. Nor is at all obvious that the pain inflicted has been worth it. In a report published last week, the Washington-based Center for Economic and Policy Research thinktank notes that the financial markets have not been troubled by the UK\u2019s rising national debt, with the interest rate on 10-year government borrowing below 1.5%. \u201cThis is significantly lower than the current rate and projected rate of inflation, which means that the UK government can borrow long-term at real interest rates that are negative. Since there are many public investments that have a positive real rate of return by increasing productivity, this means the economy and the public could benefit from public investment financed at these long-term negative real interest rates.\u201d Higher investment spending makes a lot of sense. For a start, it would help offset higher interest rates from the Bank of England. It would also provide a much-needed boost to the UK\u2019s struggling construction sector. It would help address the problem of weak long-term productivity growth identified by the OBR. And it would raise activity in the short term, putting the UK in a stronger bargaining position in the Brexit negotiations. Hammond is in a much stronger position personally than he was a few months ago. He will be able to brush aside suggestions that he could find better uses for his \u00a310bn windfall this year than save it for a rainy day. But the case for higher investment is being made not just by Labour but also by Hammond\u2019s critics within the Conservative party, such as the MP Nick Boles and Theresa May\u2019s former policy adviser Nick Timothy. They note that violence in prisons is on the increase and that waiting lists in A&amp;E departments of hospitals are rising sharply. After eight years of austerity, public services are close to breaking point.",

First, cut spending on the public sector, on wages, for instance, or on social security. Second, raise revenue through higher taxes and selling state assets. Greece, for instance, has sold its airports in Corfu and Santorini, among others, to a German company.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What was their reasoning?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Proponents made a variety of arguments for this strategy. It was said that governments had spent too much money, that everyone needed to tighten their belts. The UK\u2019s then-chancellor, George Osborne, claimed that the public sector was \"crowding out\" the private sector, taking resources and workers away from businesses. Particularly influential was a paper by two US-based economists, Ken Rogoff and Carmen Reinhart, arguing that once a country\u2019s total public borrowing rose above 90% of its national income, or GDP, growth would slow sharply.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Did austerity get unanimous backing?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Critics argued that austerity would stop economies recovering from the shock of the banking meltdown and would make teachers and nurses and people with disabilities pay for the excesses of bankers and chief executives. In his book Austerity: The History of a Dangerous Idea, political economist Mark Blyth showed that austerity had been tried before in the 20th&nbsp;century \u2013 everywhere from Weimar Germany to 1930s America \u2013 and failed, often with politically disastrous consequences.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Finally, no sooner had the OBR slashed its forecasts for productivity than the numbers started to improve, with the final two quarters of 2017 recording output per head rising by 0.8-0.9%.

The figures usually get revised in subsequent months as more data from businesses and government departments is received.

      "bodyText": "For me, one of the great tests of a play, film or opera is that it should be so absorbing that one\u2019s mind switches off from day-to-day, mundane concerns. The Churchill film Darkest Hour is an exception that proves the rule. How could one possibly not reflect on the present failure of British leadership as we are reminded of the way Churchill rose to the occasion in the face of powerful opposition? Last week\u2019s response from our partners (still!) in the European Union to Theresa May\u2019s latest speech confirmed that, in its pusillanimous reaction to the referendum, the May government has been going around in circles. Why should they be surprised? By bowing to a vociferous minority of rightwing, deeply prejudiced, anti-European fantasists in her party, May has ruled out membership of the present customs union and single market \u2013 privileges that more enlightened predecessors in her party, including the Brexiters\u2019 heroine, Margaret Thatcher, fought for decades to achieve. I say \u201cfantasists\u201d advisedly. I have pointed out before that dreams of being free to build up markets in China look absurd when one notes that, supposedly imprisoned by the shackles of the EU, Germany already manages to export many multiples of what we send there. But if ever there were an example of why the advisory vote by 37% of the electorate to leave the EU should be reconsidered, it is the obvious impact of the lurch into protectionism by the egregious president of the United States. This surely scotches the fantasy of Messrs Johnson, Gove and Fox that all would be plain sailing after Brexit via a wonderful new trading relationship with the US. In the admirably swift response from Brussels, within a week there has arisen the prospect of a trade war between the US and EU. One hopes it will not come to that, but it was smart of our EU partners to list examples of Europe\u2019s favourite US imports that would be affected in a tit-for-tat response to Trump\u2019s plan for steel and aluminium tariffs. The situation has echoes of the 1930s, and the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act of June 1930. This was considered by the economist AH Metzler to have converted the recession aggravated by the 1929 Wall Street crash and banking crisis into a depression. But in his magnum opus Major Recessions, the British economist Christopher Dow points out that, by that stage, the Depression was already severe. What Smoot-Hawley did was, \u201cby reducing foreign competition\u201d, divert demand from imported to domestic supplies and raise US output. This, of course, is precisely what Trump has in mind for his rust-belt voters. But it is not good news for the liberal world trading order, let alone for the British steel industry. There are many reasons why the result of the referendum should be reconsidered, and the thought of \u201cgoing it alone\u201d on the eve of a potential trade war is certainly one of them. There is also the manifestly insoluble problem of Northern Ireland. It seems to me no coincidence that in recent weeks, former prime ministers Sir John Major and Tony Blair, both of whom worked on what became the Good Friday agreement, should have spoken out in favour of a reconsideration of the May government\u2019s policy. It is a tragedy that Blair is not taken seriously on this issue on account of his historic misjudgment over Iraq \u2013 about which I said a great deal in this column at the time. But Major, who knows what it is like to have to put up with Eurosceptical fantasists, has developed into a formidable elder statesman. Having endured quite enough backseat driving from Thatcher, whom he succeeded, he does not criticise successors lightly. But he recently attacked May\u2019s \u201cunrealistic\u201d negotiating strategy and her \u201cultra-Brexiteer\u201d colleagues. It was Philip Hammond, the chancellor, who said after the event that the British people did not vote to become poorer. Yet May\u2019s \u201cstrategy\u201d amounts to just that. In one historically important phrase, Major said the prime minister had a duty to consider the impact of Brexit on the \u201cwellbeing\u201d of the people. As DJ Galligan, editor of the book Constitution in Crisis puts it: \u201cThe House of Commons is a representative body, the principal duty of which is to act for the good of the nation, formerly called the common weal, now sometimes expressed as the common good, at other times the public interest.\u201d Terrible things are going on in the world at present. Brexit has not yet happened. If it does, it is guaranteed to make things worse for the common good of this country, and to destroy our reputation and influence abroad. Wake up, Theresa May! Rise to the occasion!",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The chancellor\u2019s budget remarks on Tuesday, now downgraded as a \u201cpolicy-neutral\u201d spring statement, will be a chance to look in the rear-view mirror and see what a missed opportunity the past eight years have been. It was a period dominated by George Osborne\u2019s portrayal of the UK as a sinking ship, where every Whitehall department needed to be scaled down, welfare spending cut and some services provided by the state thrown overboard. There was a clear ideological drive behind his mission \u2013 one that sought a smaller state and favoured corporation tax cuts while workers suffered a prolonged wages freeze. There are few thinktanks and significant figures who influenced the debate at the time who still agree that austerity was the right medicine. The Paris-based Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development and the International Monetary Fund were cheerleaders for austerity in 2010. Both later renounced their support. They came to see what Keynesian economists saw at the time: that the UK version of austerity was a leeches-and-mercury remedy that meant Osborne was more akin to an 18th-century doctor than a 21st-century economic strategist. There was an opportunity in 2010, and that was to invest in the country\u2019s essential services with the knock-on effect of creating skilled jobs and a lasting legacy of improved infrastructure. The Bank of England\u2019s stimulus package, which has amounted to the longest period of almost zero interest rates in history and \u00a3435bn of quantitative easing, provided the confidence and cheap borrowing needed for higher levels of investment. Instead, Osborne encouraged a coffee culture that meant most of the borrowed funds went on property purchases or cappuccinos and barista wages. It meant more people could be employed in the hospitality trade, pushing employment to record highs. But it was all froth and will probably evaporate when the cheap borrowing comes to an end. While it might be an exaggeration to say that an end to the era of cheap borrowing is around the corner, the UK is now entering its first year of monetary tightening since the financial crash of 2008. Last November\u2019s interest rate rise merely reversed a post-Brexit referendum cut from the year before. In May there is the prospect of a first material rise for a decade, with another later in the year. Whatever the Bank\u2019s justification for reducing its stimulus, the fact is that it will effectively be withdrawing funds at the same time as the chancellor, Philip Hammond, presses on with Osborne-like austerity. There will be another benefits freeze in April and a 3% council tax rise. Inflation may start to come down this year, but wages show little sign of keeping pace, meaning that workers face another year of zero or very low real wages growth. So it makes sense, just to keep the economy on an even keel, to relax the budget purse strings. The shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, is right to say that austerity has pushed essential services to the brink. He says that the spring statement should contain measures to ease austerity. And the chancellor has the money to do it. Official figures show that in the 12 months ending in January, there was a surplus in the government\u2019s day-to-day spending over the previous year of \u00a33bn. The overall public spending deficit is below 2%. The Treasury\u2019s independent forecaster, the Office for Budget Responsibility, is expected to say that future borrowing levels will be much lower than previously predicted. Hammond will defend his frugality by saying that he needs the money in reserve to cope with a potentially disastrous Brexit. That\u2019s a defence he has used at every budget. Now he must attend to Britain\u2019s fraying fabric or risk lasting damage, Brexit or no Brexit. Slowing housing market doesn\u2019t need pumping up Why don\u2019t estate agents look out of the window in the morning? Because then they\u2019d have nothing to do in the afternoon. That was the joke that went the rounds in the early 1990s, when the UK property market went through a savage recession that saw arrears and repossessions rise to levels not seen before or since. It might not be all that long before that joke makes a comeback. The trade body that represents estate agents says new-buyer inquiries have fallen for an 11th month and that the number of properties for sale has hit a record low. Meanwhile, Britain\u2019s biggest mortgage lender, the Halifax, says annual house price inflation slowed to 1.8% in February, its lowest level in five years. The last time the housing market was as flat as this, George Osborne to hit the panic button. Mortgage lending was boosted by the cheap credit offered to banks through the Funding for Lending scheme while the Treasury subsidised first-time buyers through help to buy. Up to a point, the strategy worked. The economy had a sugar rush in which a rising housing market led to stronger consumer demand. Osborne was considered a political genius when the Tories won a surprise majority in the 2015 election. But then prices rose so high that houses became unaffordable to first-time buyers, even with ultra-low interest rates. And unlike in the 1990s, there is no pressure on homeowners to sell, because unemployment continues to fall and it is so cheap to service a mortgage. The easing back of house price inflation has simply increased the incentive for sellers to sit tight. Activity will recover, but only when houses get more affordable. That will only happen if prices stay flat and wages rise \u2013 which may take some time, given that annual earnings growth is running at only 2.5%. The government should resist the temptation to interfere with this process, no matter what estate agents say. Low house price inflation is both inevitable and welcome. Ups and downs of the fracking game It\u2019s been a rollercoaster fortnight for Britain\u2019s nascent shale industry. First, frackers received the perfect gift to bolster their case that the UK needs to extract the gas beneath its feet, when freezing Siberian weather and supply problems forced National Grid to issue a plea to markets for more gas. A sudden record-breaking jump in prices meant more gas flowed to the UK and no one suffered a shortfall, but the shale industry was quick to seize on the episode as evidence the UK is over-reliant on imports. With the UK importing 60% of its gas today, and National Grid expecting that to rise to 93% by 2040, it seems like a compelling argument. But then came the setbacks for shale firms last week, which raises the question of whether they will ever get round to extracting gas buried in rocks deep underground. First, Third Energy started dismantling and removing crucial equipment at its site at Kirby Misperton in North Yorkshire because of delays stemming from government checks on its financial health. A day later, the Barclays-backed firm announced that, rather than becoming the first company to frack in the UK since 2011, as expected, it would now postpone work until autumn. There was more to come. UK petrochemicals firm Ineos suffered its third rejection by a local authority this year, when Rotherham borough council turned down its bid to drill near the village of Woodsetts. Other shale firms have also been knocked back in recent weeks. The shale industry says such delays are to be expected in the energy business, and are no different from those facing nuclear and renewables projects. But there is no getting around the fact that there have now been years of false dawns for UK shale. The industry hasn\u2019t even begun its exploration phase, let alone commercial production. All eyes are now on Cuadrilla, the Lancashire-based firm backed by British Gas owner Centrica, which has also been repeatedly delayed in its efforts. If Cuadrilla can start work in Lancashire in June, as it claims, it would finally show the industry can do more than just talk.",

Mortgage lending was boosted by the cheap credit offered to banks through the Funding for Lending scheme while the Treasury subsidised first-time buyers through <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/help-to-buy-scheme\" title=\"\">help to buy.</a></p> <p>Up to a point, the strategy worked. The economy had a sugar rush in which a rising housing market led to stronger consumer demand. Osborne was considered a political genius when the Tories won a surprise majority in the 2015 election.</p> <p>But then prices rose so high that houses became unaffordable to first-time buyers, even with ultra-low interest rates. And unlike in the 1990s, there is no pressure on homeowners to sell, because unemployment continues to fall and it is so cheap to service a mortgage. The easing back of house price inflation has simply increased the incentive for sellers to sit tight.</p> <p>Activity will recover, but only when houses get more affordable. That will only happen if prices stay flat and wages rise \u2013 which may take some time, given that annual earnings growth is running at only 2.5%.</p> <p>The government should resist the temptation to interfere with this process, no matter what estate agents say. Low house price inflation is both inevitable and welcome.</p> <h2>Ups and downs of the fracking game</h2> <p>It\u2019s been a rollercoaster fortnight for Britain\u2019s nascent shale industry. First, frackers received the perfect gift to bolster their case that the UK needs to extract the gas beneath its feet, when freezing Siberian weather and supply problems <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/mar/01/uk-is-running-out-of-gas-national-grid-warns-freezing-weather\" title=\"\">forced National Grid to issue a plea to markets for more gas</a>.</p> <p>A sudden record-breaking jump in prices meant more gas flowed to the UK and no one suffered a shortfall, but the shale industry was quick to seize on the episode as evidence the UK is over-reliant on imports. With the UK importing 60% of its gas today, and National Grid expecting that to rise to 93% by 2040, it seems like a compelling argument.</p> <p>But then came the setbacks for shale firms last week, which raises the question of whether they will ever get round to extracting gas buried in rocks deep underground.</p> <p>First, Third Energy started dismantling and removing crucial equipment at its site at Kirby Misperton in North Yorkshire because of delays stemming from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/jan/25/blow-to-fracking-firms-as-uk-insists-on-financial-checks\" title=\"\">government checks on its financial health</a>. A day later, the Barclays-backed firm announced that, rather than becoming the first company to frack in the UK since 2011, as expected, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/mar/07/fracking-delayed-north-yorkshire-site-autumn-third-energy\" title=\"\">it would now postpone work until autumn</a>.</p> <p>There was more to come. UK petrochemicals firm Ineos suffered its third rejection by a local authority this year, when <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/mar/08/uk-fracking-backlash-seven-out-of-eight-plans-rejected-in-2018\" title=\"\">Rotherham borough council turned down its bid to drill near the village of Woodsetts</a>. Other shale firms have also been knocked back in recent weeks.</p> <p>The shale industry says such delays are to be expected in the energy business, and are no different from those facing nuclear and renewables projects. But there is no getting around the fact that there have now been years of false dawns for UK shale. The industry hasn\u2019t even begun its exploration phase, let alone commercial production.</p> <p>All eyes are now on Cuadrilla, the Lancashire-based firm backed by British Gas owner Centrica, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/dec/25/fracking-start-2018-shale-gas-uk-industry-protests\" title=\"\">which has also been repeatedly delayed in its efforts</a>. If Cuadrilla can start work in Lancashire in June, as it claims, it would finally show the industry can do more than just talk.</p>",
