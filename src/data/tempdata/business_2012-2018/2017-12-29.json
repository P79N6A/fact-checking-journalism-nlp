      "bodyText": "The rich got richer and the poor piled on more debt as shockwaves from the Brexit vote continued to reverberate in 2017. Billionaire George Soros dismissed Donald Trump as a \u201ccon-man\u201d, while Britain\u2019s biggest chicken supplier was revealed to have been fiddling its food safety records. Airlines had a turbulent year, from the sad death of Simon the giant rabbit to Ryanair\u2019s shock cancellation of thousands of flights after it messed up its pilot rosters. Based on the number of page views, here are our 10 most popular business stories of 2017. 1. Hard times for Whole Foods: \u2018People say it\u2019s for pretentious people. I can see why\u2019 A \u201cpretentious\u201d American grocery group nicknamed \u201cWhole Paycheck\u201d made it to the top of our most-read list in 2017, as takeover rumours swirled around the once high-flying, organic-focused retailer. Shoppers loved Whole Foods\u2019 products, but not its prices: \u201cWhen you\u2019re shopping for the cheaper, more afofrdable things, you\u2019re reminded of the things you can\u2019t afford,\u201d said one. A consumer backlash had led to six straight quarters of declining sales by April. Two months later online giant Amazon swooped in with a $13.7bn takeover in a bold move seen as a game-changer for the entire food retail sector. 2. Deloitte hit by cyber-attack revealing clients\u2019 secret emails In September the Guardian revealed one of the world\u2019s \u201cbig four\u201d accountancy firms had been the victim of a sophisticated cybersecurity attack that had gone unnoticed for months. The attack on Deloitte compromised confidential emails and plans of some of the firm\u2019s blue chip clients, including household name companies and US government departments. Hackers may have accessed usernames, passwords and other personal details. 3. United Airlines \u2018saddened\u2019 by death of giant rabbit after transatlantic flight Simon, a 10-month-old giant rabbit, met a sad end after a transatlantic flight from London Heathrow to Chicago\u2019s O\u2019Hare airport in April. Although he was alive when the United Airlines plane landed in America, Simon was later found dead in his cage in a pet facility run by the airline. It was a tragedy for Simon \u2013 whose owner said he had been \u201cas fit as a fiddle\u201d on leaving London \u2013 and another PR disaster for United Airlines. Just three weeks earlier, a video showing a passenger being dragged off a United flight had sparked widespread outrage. 4. George Soros: Theresa May won\u2019t last and Trump is \u2018would-be dictator\u2019 One of the highlights of this year\u2019s World Economic Forum in Davos was an attack on Donald Trump from octogenarian billionaire and philanthropist George Soros. At a plush dinner at the Swiss ski resort last January, the night before the presidential inauguration, Soros called Trump an \u2018imposter and a con-man\u201d who would trigger a trade war and try \u2013 unsuccessfully \u2013 to rule as a dictator. Soros also predicted that Theresa May wouldn\u2019t last long as UK prime minister and the inflation would drive down UK living standards \u2013 so he certainly got one prediction right. 5. UK\u2019s top supplier of supermarket chicken fiddles food safety dates An investigation by the Guardian and ITV news revealed that the UK\u2019s top supplier of chicken to supermarkets was tampering with food safety records. In undercover footage recorded at a 2 Sisters plant, workers were seen altering the slaughter date of poultry being processed, which may have duped customers into buying out-of-date meat. 6. Ryanair may face legal action over flight cancellations Ryanair was forced to cancel thousands of flights after a \u201cmess-up\u201d in how it scheduled time off for its pilots. Chief executive Michael O\u2019Leary apologised to customers but the budget airline\u2019s inept handling of the roster-related cancellations served to compound the outrage, as it was accused by the Civil Aviation Authority of \u201cpersistently misleading passengers\u201d about their rights. By the end of the year, the airline would finally recognise pilot and cabin crew unions, marking dramatic shift after decades of refusing to negotiate with them. 7. Jamie Oliver to close six restaurants in \u2018tough market\u2019 after Brexit vote In January, Jamie Oliver was left exposed by tough trading and the \u201cpressures and unknowns\u201d following the Brexit vote, which saw him close six of his Jamie\u2019s Italian outlets. The six restaurants shuttered accounted for less than 5% of the restaurant chain\u2019s total turnover and overall the chain was continuing to perform well both in the UK and abroad. 8. World\u2019s witnessing a new Gilded Age as billionaires\u2019 wealth swells to $6tn Not since the time of the Carnegies, Rockerfellers and Vanderbilts at the turn of the 20th century was so much owned by so few, as a new wealth report published in October revealed that billionaires had increased their combined global wealth by almost a fifth, to a record $6tn. But the world\u2019s ultra-wealthy were, apparently, worried by this new \u201cGilded Age\u201d. According to the the lead author of the UBS/PwC Billionaires report they feared the growing gap between rich and poor could lead to a \u201cstrike back\u201d. 9. Chief economist of Bank of England admits errors in Brexit forecasting \u201cIt\u2019s a fair cop\u201d, admitted the Bank of England\u2019s chief economist Andy Haldane just a few days into the new year, as he accepted that the UK\u2019s central bank had misjudged the impact of the Brexit vote. Economists had been brought into disrepute by a series of forecasting errors before and after the financial crash, and for predicting there would be a dramatic slowdown in the economy if the UK were to vote to leave the EU, he said. But while the Bank was wrong about the timing of a post-Brexit slump, Haldane insisted it would be proved right about the fundamentals. 10. Britain\u2019s debt timebomb: FCA urges action over \u00a3200bn crisis Britain\u2019s borrowing binge topped \u00a3200bn, prompting a warning from the nation\u2019s chief financial regulator that the government needed to step in to avert a debt crisis. Andrew Bailey told the Guardian that he was concerned about the sheer number of people who need loans to make ends meet, pinpointing gig economy workers as particularly vulnerable. \u2022 Follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk, or sign up to the daily Business Today email here.",

      "bodyText": "Global stock markets have ended 2017 on record highs, gaining $9tn (\u00a36.7tn) in value over the year due to a strong worldwide economy, President Donald Trump\u2019s tax cuts and central banks\u2019 go-slow approach to easing financial support. The FTSE 100 hit a new peak in London, with an all-time closing high of 7687.77, having earlier hit a new all-time peak of 7697.62. The leading UK index was boosted by a late surge in mining stocks as commodity prices rose against a weaker dollar and optimism grew about the Chinese economy, leaving the index up 7.6% over the year. In global terms, the MSCI all-country world index gained 22% or $9tn on the year to an all-time high of 514.53. Even the rival attractions of bitcoin, up nearly 14 times over the year, and concerns about war with North Korea, political upheaval in Europe with the Catalan separatist movement in Spain and an inconclusive German election failed to dampen the party mood. Craig James, chief economist at Sydney-based fund manager CommSec, said that of the 73 bourses it tracks globally, all but nine have recorded gains in local currency terms this year. The key for 2018 will be whether central banks maintain a benign approach to reducing their financial support, he added, with the Federal Reserve and Bank of England raising borrowing costs only gradually this year. Low interest rates and quantitative easing, where central banks buy bonds from financial institutions, have been a major support for investors and asset prices in recent years. \u201cFor the outlook, the key issue is whether the low growth rates of prices and wages will continue, thus prompting central banks to remain on the monetary policy sidelines,\u201d said James. \u201cGlobalisation and technological change have been influential in keeping inflation low. In short, consumers can buy goods whenever they want and wherever they are.\u201d President Trump\u2019s political agenda was a key factor for investors in 2017. The US president\u2019s tax bill, which finally passed through Congress in December, fanned hopes that companies would use their windfalls from the changes to expand their businesses or return cash to shareholders. A spate of recent mergers, including Disney\u2019s $66bn move for Rupert Murdoch\u2019s 21st Century Fox, France\u2019s Unibail-Rodamco buying shopping centre specialist Westfield for $25bn and GVC agreeing a deal for Ladbrokes Coral, also helped sentiment. Despite the FTSE 100\u2019s latest record, its annual 7.6% increase was dwarfed by the 19% gain recorded by Japan\u2019s Nikkei 225, the 32% rise on the Nasdaq 100, the near 13% jump on Germany\u2019s Dax and the almost 26% boost to the Dow Jones Industrial Average. Over the year, the FTSE 100 has added \u00a3141bn to the value of Britain\u2019s top companies. But it has lagged rivals due to concerns about the increasingly tricky talks on the terms of the UK\u2019s departure from the EU. However, a breakthrough deal on the Irish border and citizens\u2019 rights in December lifted some of that cloud, and nearly 5% of the FTSE 100\u2019s annual gain came in the final month of the year following the Brexit agreement. Its low point of 7093 was in early February, as Trump\u2019s first attempt at a travel ban upset investors. There were also currency issues for the FTSE 100. A partial recovery in the pound from its post-referendum lows \u2013 sterling had fallen by almost 20% at its worst but ended the year down less than 10% \u2013 hit the overseas earners which dominate the 100 index, since they benefit from a weaker UK currency. The mid-cap FTSE 250 index, which contains more domestically focused companies, also outperformed the FTSE 100, climbing more than 14% over the year. Craig Erlam, senior market analyst at online trading group Oanda, said: \u201cThe FTSE 250 started on the back foot at the start of the year compared to the FTSE 100 [due to Brexit concerns], with sentiment towards the UK economy being more pessimistic than it is now. As the year has progressed though, it\u2019s become clear that the economic downturn in the UK has not been as severe as some feared while progress in the negotiations provides hope for domestic stocks, benefiting FTSE 250 companies over the FTSE 100.\u201d The best performers in the FTSE 100 over the year were NMC Health, which pleased investors with news of its expansion into Saudi Arabia, Worldpay after a merger approach from US payments firm Vanti, and housebuilders Persimmon and Berkeley, which recovered from their post-EU referendum falls. Why stock markets have hit record high Here are five reasons behind the record-breaking run for global stock markets this year. Boom in global growth Almost a decade since the financial crisis sparked economic decline around the world, 2017 was the year when global growth came back with a bang. Failure by rightwing populists to seize power in Europe led to political stability, helping the single currency bloc to recover after years of tumult, while China kept up its rate of expansion despite fears over a sharp slowdown. According to the OECD, global real trade growth accelerated from 2.6% in 2016 to 4.8% this year and world GDP growth jumped from 3.1% in 2016 to 3.6% in 2017. Loose tax and monetary policy Markets have received a double boost from low interest rates and tax cuts this year, stimulating demand for shares. Donald Trump\u2019s US corporate tax rate cuts are expected to boost company profits in the world\u2019s largest economy \u2013 therefore boosting returns to shareholders. Meanwhile, central banks kept pumping money into the global financial system through quantitative easing. These debt buying programmes have caused a fall in bond yields \u2013 the interest rate they pay to investors \u2013 which has forced market professionals to hunt for greater returns from riskier assets, with stocks the investment of choice. Low volatility Known as Wall Street\u2019s fear gauge, the Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility Index has fallen to record lows this year \u2013 helping to fuel the rally in shares. The gauge measures investor expectations for price swings in the stock market over a 30-day period, up or down. The Vix fell to below 9 points in July and has not gone anywhere near the 20 mark, which typically indicates that things are going awry and is a common feature of falling markets. Weak pound In Britain, the FTSE 100, packed with companies that earn much of their profit in foreign currencies, has surged as a result of stronger global growth and the weak pound since the Brexit vote. Although it has staged a recovery this year, sterling is still almost 10% down on the dollar, which benefits companies making money in foreign markets. Irrational complacency A general sense of confidence amongst investors over the state of the global economy \u2013 and the state of geopolitics \u2013 has been key. However, investors may be ignoring problems lying just beneath the surface. The fund manager Alberto Gallo at Algebris Investments thinks there are reasons to be cautious \u2013 with risks arising from geopolitics, central bank policy and higher inflation. Markets barely blinked this year, despite faltering Brexit talks and concerns over North Korea\u2019s nuclear weapons programme. Given the rising number of one-sided bets for the market to keep on rising, the risks of a rise in volatility could be growing.

      "bodyText": "Despite today\u2019s losses on Wall Street, global stock markets had a historic year. World stocks, as measured by the MSCI All-Country World Index, rose in every single month - the first time ever that shares have avoided a monthly decline. Marketwatch\u2019s Ryan Vlastelica explains: In fact, the index hasn\u2019t had a down month since October 2016. It ended up 0.5% in December, and rose 21.8% over the course of the year. Jeffrey Kleintop, chief global investment strategist at Charles Schwab, credited the strength to improving corporate profitability, tweeting, \u201cWhy have global stocks gone up every month so far this year? Earnings have too (both actual and expected).\u201d And on that note, we really are finished for 2017. Best wishes for the new year, and goodnight! Hello again. After a rollicking year, the US stock market actually ended the final session of 2017 with some small losses. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.5% to end 2017 at 24,719.22, the broad-based S&amp;P 500 index also dropped 0.5% to close the year at 2,673.61, while the tech-rich Nasdaq Composite Index shed 0.7% to end at 6,903.39. But it was still a very good year for the Dow, which closed at record levels on 71 occasions - itself a record. Hello again. Here\u2019s our news story about the global stock market rally this year: I may pop back later with the Wall Street close, or any other major events. Either way, we wish you all the best for 2018. Happy New Year! GW Amazon\u2019s share price has taken a knock, though, after Donald Trump tweeted that it was getting an unfairly generous deal from the US post service. Here\u2019s the tweet in question: Ding ding! Over in New York, the final trading day of the year is underway. And stocks are moving a little higher - with the Dow Jones industrial average gaining 30 points or 0.12%, and the S&amp;P 500 index up 0.16%. 2017 has been a bumper year for America\u2019s stock market, with the Dow surging by 25%m, and the tech-focused Nasdaq up by nearly a third. Technology stocks had a particularly amazing year -- Facebook, Amazon and Netflix all jumped by over 50%, and Apple was close behind. Gold has had its best year since 2010, pushed up by the weaker US dollar. It just hit $1,300 for the first time since mid-October. The FTSE 100 surged by around \u00a3141bn during 2017, according to the London stock exchange. The FTSE 250 index, which contains medium-sized companies, gained around \u00a352bn as it rattled to fresh record highs. That fed into the $9 trillion surge in global share prices during this year (as measured by MSCI) Shares have been a pretty decent investment this year - giving a rather better return than your local bank. Richard Stone, chief executive of The Share Centre (a retail stockbroker) says there are reasons why shares could keep rising in 2018. He says: \u201cFor the second year in a row the FTSE100 has ended the year at an all-time high. Personal investors will have been relieved this year by a respite from the high volatility seen in the last couple of years. The level of volatility this year has though been remarkably low by historical standards and this has perhaps meant fewer trading opportunities for those investors who trade more actively. Market commentators have expressed concerns about valuation levels for some time indicating a correction may be on the horizon. However, the market appears to be shrugging off any such concerns and continuing to go from strength to strength. Higher global growth forecasts, a continuation of relatively relaxed monetary policy and a loosening of fiscal policy specifically in the United States are all helping support equities. A personal investor who put money into a FTSE 100 tracker fund at the start of this year will have seen a return of nearly 8% with a dividend payout (yield) of over 3% on top of that. With base rates now at just 0.5% and returns on cash remaining depressed the stark choice for investors seeking to drive an income from their capital is clear and this too helps drive demand for equities and equity based collectives (funds). Mining giants also had a good year, thanks to a boom in commodity prices which saw copper hit a four-year high this week. So, which shares should you have bought a year ago, and which should have come with a health warning? The best-performing share on the FTSE 100 during 2017 was actually a healthcare business based in the the United Arab Emirates, called NMC Health. It jumped by 86% during the year; any traders who backed NMC may be sprinting to the nearest City champagne bar this afternoon.... Second was Worldpay, the payments processor company spun out of the wreckage of Royal Bank of Scotland. It jumped by 57%, thanks to a takeover bid from US rival Vantiv. Housebuilders also had a strong year; Persimmon was the third-best performing member of the Footsie, up 54%, followed by Berkeley Group which gained 49%. But some companies will be glad to see the back of 2017. Centrica slumped by over 40%, partly due to a big profits warning in November, while telecommunications group BT and advertising giant WPP both shank by around a quarter. Breaking! A late burst of buy orders have sent Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 index up to a new all-time high. The final trading day of 2017 ended with a flourish, with the FTSE 100 closing up 64 points or 0.85% at 7,687 points. Just before the close, it hit a new intraday high of 7697 points. This means the blue-chip index has gained 7.6% during 2017. With the smaller FTSE 250 index also closing at a new record high, this puts the seal on a good year for the London stock market. But, this still means the Footsie has lagged behind other stock markets - with Japan\u2019s Topix and the US S&amp;P 500 both up around 20% during 2017. Just 10 minutes until the end of the trading year in London, and the FTSE 100 is heading towards a fresh closing high..... World stock markets have surged to a new alltime high today, meaning they\u2019ve put on a blistering $9 trillion in value since the start of January. That\u2019s according to Reuters, which reports: Markets were ending 2017 in a party mood on Friday after a year in which a concerted pick-up in global growth boosted corporate profits and commodity prices, while benign inflation kept central banks from snatching away the monetary punch bowl. MSCI\u2019s world equity index, which tracks 47 countries, inched up 0.15% as six straight weeks and now 13 straight months of gains left it at yet another all time high. The index has been on an upward trajectory for pretty much all of 2017, putting it 22 percent and almost $9 trillion higher for the year. Emerging markets have led the charge with gains of 34%. Hong Kong surged 36%, South Korea notched up 22% and India and Poland both made 27% in local currency terms. Japan\u2019s Nikkei and the S&amp;P 500 are both ahead by almost 20%, while the Dow has risen by a quarter. In Europe, the German DAX has gained nearly 14 %, though the UK FTSE has lagged a little with a rise of 7%. More here: Stocks cheer $9 trillion year, downer for the dollar The euro has enjoyed its best year since 2003, thanks to the recovery in the eurozone economy. The single currency is the best performing G10 currency, according to Bloomberg data: More photos of traders celebrating the last day of trading at the Philippine Stock Exchange in Manila have arrived; it seemed wrong not to share them. Traders have plenty to celebrate -- the main Philippine stock index hit an alltime high this morning, and has gained 25% this year. That helped Asian shares to rack up their best year since 2009 (as discussed earlier). The smaller FTSE 250 index is also at record levels. It rose by 0.25% to 20,695 points, a gain of 55 points this morning. The FTSE 100 is pushing further into record territory, as City investors get their buy orders in before trading closes early at 12.30pm. The blue-chip index has now hit a fresh record high of 7,648 points, up 25 points or 0.3% today. Reuters points out that natural resourse stocks had a stonking year: Miners have been among the FTSE\u2019s best-performing stocks this year, with Antofagasta up 47.4% and Glencore up 40.7% year-to-date. Elsewhere NMC Health has been the index\u2019s best-performing stock, while a takeover has pushed Worldpay\u2019s shares 57 percent higher this year. Housebuilders Persimmon and Berkeley Group have both had a comeback year, recovering after seeing their shares plummet in the immediate aftermath of the UK\u2019s Brexit referendum in June 2016. Technology companies have led the rally in Europe this year, mirroring the surge in Amazon, Google, Apple, Facebook et al. Miners, banks and industrial companies also had a good year, as this chart shows: Like most financial assets, shares are generally held by richer people (either directly or through pension funds). So the surge in global stock markets this year won\u2019t have helped tackle wealth inequality. The FTSE 100\u2019s 6% rise this year has outpaced inflation (3.1% in December) and wages (up 2.3% during 2017). And the bad news for British workers is that pay growth is likely to lag behind all other wealthy nations in 2018. 2017 hasn\u2019t just been about rising stock markets. Brexit, Donald Trump, food safety, inequality and even a giant, sadly deceased, rabbit called Simon featured in our most popular stories this year. Here\u2019s a round-up of the business news that got you all clicking this year. The strong rally in Asia\u2019s stock markets this year is particularly remarkable, given the geopolitical threat posed by North Korea and the risk that president Trump could trigger a trade war. But instead, traders have shrugged off these worries - sending shares jumping across the region. As CNBC puts it: While geopolitical uncertainty was a major focal point earlier this year \u2014 with several North Korean missile launches initially sending investor scurrying into safe-have assets \u2014 risk appetite has since improved, with markets looking instead to stronger economic growth globally. MSCI\u2019s broad index of shares in Asia Pacific excluding Japan was up more than 34 percent year-to-date on Friday morning. That\u2019s above the roughly 25 percent climb seen on the Dow Jones industrial average and 8 percent rise on the pan-European STOXX 600 over the same period. The London stock market is \u201cdoing its festive best\u201d to reach the New Year at a fresh record high, says Mike van Dulken of Accendo Markets. Here are the top risers and fallers on the FTSE 100, as it hovers around this morning\u2019s peak of 7,636 points. Most global stock markets have enjoyed strong gains this year. Craig James, chief economist at fund manager CommSec, said of the 73 bourses it tracks globally, all but nine have recorded gains in local currency terms this year (that\u2019s via Reuters). Japan\u2019s Topix share index has also enjoyed a bumper year; it\u2019s risen by over 19% during 2017. Traders held a ceremony to mark the end of the trading year, and invited Go champion Yuta Iyama to ring the closing bell. European stock markets are on track to record their best year since 2013. The Stoxx 600 index has just opened flat, leaving it on track for a near-8% gain over the last 12 months. The pound is also having a good morning. It\u2019s up 0.5% against the US dollar at $1.35, a three-week high. Boom! Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 index has hit a new record at the start of trading. The blue-chip index has jumped by 13 points to 7,636, slightly over yesterday\u2019s record high. It means the Footsie has risen by 4.5% during December - a month that saw Britain agree the first phase of a Brexit deal with Brussels. Just Eat, the fast food-ordering app company, is leading the risers, up 1.8%. It only joined the FTSE 100 this month, after seeing its value overtake the likes of supermarket chain J Sainsbury. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. It\u2019s the final day of the trading year, and what a year it\u2019s been for investors. Stocks have surged world wide over the last 12 months - thanks to renewed confidence in the global economy and a steady drip-drip-drip of monetary stimulus from central bankers. Over in Asia, the markets have enjoyed their best year since the aftermath of the financial crisis in 2009. The MSCI Asia Pacific Index, which tracks stocks across the region, has surged by almost 29% this year. Hong Kong has enjoyed a particularly exuberant year - jumping by an sparkling 36%, while South Korea posted a 22% gain and India jumped by 27%. Ceremonies have already been taking place at stock markets across Asia, including in Tokyo and Manila. Many commodities have strengthened this year too, at the expense of the weaker US dollar. Donald Trump\u2019s push for tax cuts has not made the greenback great again. In Europe, many stock markets are already sitting on double-digit gains - Germany\u2019s DAX, for example, is up 13%. Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 hit fresh record highs this week, but has actually only gained around 6.7% during the year. Today\u2019s trading session will end at 12.30pm. So, a solid year for shares. But could the markets be peaking? Some investors worry that the good times could end soon. For example, an index from State Street that tracks investor risk appetite suffered its six straight monthly fall in December. As Michael Metcalfe, State Street\u2019s head of global macro strategy, put it: \u201cWhile the broader economic outlook appears increasingly rosy, as captured by measures of consumer and business confidence, the more cautious nature of investors hints at a concern that markets may have already discounted much of the good news.\u201d There\u2019s not much in the agenda (understandably), apart from new inflation figures from Germany.",

      "bodyText": "The first-ever shipment of Russian gas to the UK looks likely to head straight back out on another ship, disproving Moscow\u2019s claims that Britain will be reliant on it for supplies this winter. National Grid confirmed that gas from a Russian field targeted by US sanctions had been delivered by a Russian icebreaker to storage facilities at the Isle of Grain in Kent on Thursday night. Russian media seized on the delivery of liquefied natural gas (LNG) to claim it would \u201ckeep Britons from freezing this winter\u201d while the Russian embassy in the UK tweeted: \u201cFeeling cold? Help is on the way.\u201d However, industry experts said the most likely scenario was that the UK would simply be a stopping-off point for the gas, which could fetch a much higher price in Asia. Ed Cox, the editor of global LNG at the market intelligence firm ICIS, said: \u201cI would urge some caution [on the idea Russian gas will be supplying the UK]. There\u2019s another empty LNG vessel outside the Isle of Grain now, which looks like it\u2019s going to come in and pick up that cargo. \u201cThe [gas] prices are much more attractive in Asia and India than they are in Europe.\u201d Market sources had told ICIS that the LNG was expected to be picked up by the other ship, he added. A spokesperson for National Grid said the gas had not entered the national network of pipelines that supplies homes and businesses. The Christophe de Margerie tanker arrived at the Isle of Grain at about 7.20pm on Thursday and has been offloading its gas to huge storage tanks before a planned departure at 6pm on Friday. The icebreaker set off earlier this month from the Yamal LNG project in the Russian Arctic, a gas field that is jointly owned by the Russian gas producer Novatek, the state-owned China National Petroleum Corporation and the French oil firm Total. The project is one of those affected by US sanctions against Russian energy projects, though not directly by UK sanctions. The ship\u2019s departure came after UK gas prices soared in mid-December when a major North Sea oil and gas pipeline was shut down after a crack was discovered. Ineos, owner of the Forties pipeline system, said this week the crack had been repaired and normal operation would resume \u201caround the new year\u201d. UK gas prices have since fallen back down to normal levels, and Cox said the real story was not Russian gas but imports from Belgium. \u201cWe are on course for very high gas pipeline imports from Belgium, potentially for a four-and-half-year high,\u201d said Cox.",

The investment bank said most of the cost would come from Trump\u2019s \u201crepatriation tax\u201d designed to encourage multinationals to bring back the trillions of dollars they hold overseas to avoid tax. Goldman, which made profits of $7.4bn last year, said: \u201cThe enactment of the tax legislation will result in a reduction of approximately $5bn in the firm\u2019s earnings for the fourth quarter and year ending 31 December 2017, approximately two-thirds of which is due to the repatriation tax. \u201cThe remainder includes the effects of the implementation of the territorial tax system and the remeasurement of US deferred tax assets at lower enacted corporate tax rates,\u201d the bank said in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission on Friday. Last week Congress approved the biggest tax overhaul in 30 years, which includes big tax cuts for companies and wealthy people. The reduction in corporation tax \u2013 from 35% to 21% \u2013 is designed in part to encourage multinational to repatriate cash from overseas. US companies were estimated, by Citigroup, to hold $2.5tn of capital overseas. Companies had previously explained that they had a duty to shareholders to keep the money abroad, rather than bring it back to the US and pay large tax bills. The tax overhaul will allow Apple to bring back its $252.3bn foreign cash mountain without a major tax hit. The huge amount of untaxed profits Apple holds overseas has become a major political football and a headache for the world\u2019s most valuable company. Drugmaker Amgen said last week that it expected to pay $6bn to $6.5bn repatriating its cash to the US. Goldman said the rest of the $5bn knock to its profits would come from the cost of implementation of the territorial tax system, and tax changes that will make it harder for companies to deduct past losses from future tax bills. Barclays said this week the change to \u201cdeferred tax assets\u201d and would cost it about \u00a31bn. The tax changes were overseen by the treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, who declared the bill to be \u201cgreat for hardworking workers\u201d.

      "bodyText": "The UK boss of Bunnings is taking a surprise three-month break as the new Australian owner of Homebase struggles to crack Britain\u2019s DIY market. Peter \u201cPJ\u201d Davis will start his extended period of leave in mid-January, a decision that will raise eyebrows in the City. The 59-year-old company veteran defended his decision to take time out. He said: \u201cI\u2019ve been away from my family in Australia for three years and I want to take a break and I\u2019m going to take a break. \u201cWe have brought in a number of new senior executives so now seems like a good time. Then I\u2019ll come back fresh as a daisy and get on with it.\u201d Asked about the performance of Homebase, Davis said: \u201cThe business is tough.\u201d Wesfarmers, the Australian conglomerate, took a gamble with its \u00a3340m purchase of the struggling Homebase chain in 2016. It intends to give the 250-store chain a facelift, spending \u00a3500m to turn it into a British version of the successful Australian DIY chain Bunnings, which is famous for low prices and customer service. But at last count Homebase\u2019s figures made grim reading, with sales tumbling nearly 14% in the three months to September, a disastrous performance blamed on clearing discontinued stock. The chain lost \u00a354m in the first full year of Wesfarmers\u2019 ownership and that figure is expected to increase in the current financial year, which runs until June. Damian McGloughlin, who joined from the rival DIY chain B&amp;Q this year, would be stepping up as acting managing director, the company confirmed. Bunnings has also drafted in David Haydon from sister chain Officeworks to run Homebase. Haydon, who has worked for Wickes and B&amp;Q, will be acting chief operating officer in Davis\u2019s absence. With years of hard work and a lot of cash required to reinvent Homebase, there are questions mark over whether new Wesfarmers chief executive Rob Scott, who according to Australian press reports recently visited the UK, will be as committed to the expensive project as his predecessor Richard Goyder. John Gillam, who as boss of Bunnings was a keen supporter of the deal, has also left the group. At Wesfarmers\u2019 quarterly update in October, Bunnings\u2019 managing director, Michael Schneider, said: \u201cWhile the performance of Homebase is disappointing, we continue to be encouraged by the performance of the Bunnings pilots. We will patiently trial a range of formats, locations, and competitive environments to achieve proof of concept.\u201d There are 15 Bunnings stores in the UK, with the most recent Homebase conversion in Bicester, Oxfordshire. At just 36,700 sq ft, the Bicester branch is half the size of its big box format Bunnings Warehouse and its success will provide a template for smaller stores in the chain. \u2022 Follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk, or sign up to the daily Business Today email here.",
