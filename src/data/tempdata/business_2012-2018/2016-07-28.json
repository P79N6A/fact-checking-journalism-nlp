      "bodyText": "Growing worries about the economic outlook have dented the confidence of UK households and manufacturers, according to the latest reports to suggest the Brexit vote result will slow the economy. A poll by market researchers GfK recorded the biggest slide in consumer confidence for more than 26 years in July. The group said people were on average gloomier about their own finances, the broader economy and whether now was a good time to make big purchases such as furniture and household appliances. A separate survey of manufacturing companies, also published on Friday, paints a similar picture. Manufacturers\u2019 organisation EEF said that the sector\u2019s recovery was under threat as its poll revealed business confidence had fallen in every region of England and Wales. The GfK report on household reactions to the Brexit vote adds to evidence that consumers could rein in spending amid higher uncertainty about jobs, pay and the UK\u2019s economic health. The headline confidence index fell to -12 in July from -1 in the June survey carried out before the referendum. That was the sharpest month-to-month drop since March 1990, shortly before the UK fell into recession. The latest result was also weaker than a reading in a one-off post-referendum GfK poll of -9 conducted from 30 June to 5 July. The researchers, who surveyed 2,000 people for the full report between 1 and 15 July, said the outlook for consumer confidence would depend on how quickly the UK\u2019s trading position is clarified. \u201cConsumers in post-Brexit Britain are reporting higher levels of concern this month,\u201d said Joe Staton, head of market dynamics at GfK. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen a very significant drop in confidence, as is clear from the fall in each of our key measures, with the biggest decrease occurring in the outlook for the general economic situation in the next 12 months. \u201cHowever, the index continues to remain at a relatively elevated level by historic[al] standards. Its future trajectory depends on whether we enter a new period of damaging economic uncertainty or restore confidence by embracing a positive stance on negotiating a new deal for the UK.\u201d The poll showed people were gloomier about their current and future personal finances and about the current and future state of the UK economy. Some of the results will have been collected before Theresa May became prime minister on 13 July and appointed a new cabinet, so ministers will be hoping a return to some political stability could improve confidence readings in coming months. The report follows a clutch of business surveys this week suggesting the vote to leave the EU could derail Britain\u2019s economy following relatively strong economic growth in the run-up to the referendum. GDP was revealed to be up 0.6% in the second quarter, greater than the 0.4% growth seen in the previous three months, but more timely indicators pointed to falling confidence among car factories, high street stores and in the construction industry. Manufacturing group EEF has added its voice to that gloom on Friday. Its overview of business confidence among factory bosses found optimism dropped most sharply in the south-east England and London region and in Wales. The smallest decline in confidence was among firms in the north-east England, according to the survey carried out with accountants BDO. The poll of 410 firms found that UK manufacturers\u2019 average confidence score just before the referendum was 6.37 out of a possible 10 points, and had declined to 5.24 following the vote. \u201cThe Brexit vote has put the manufacturing sector\u2019s recovery in jeopardy,\u201d said Lee Hopley, chief economist at EEF. She noted that despite suffering the largest fall, the south east England and London region still ranked top in the UK for business confidence while the north-west England and the east Midlands had the lowest scores. \u201cThe growth path is now uncertain in all regions and, while firms in the south-east and London and Wales look better placed to ride the storm, companies in the eastern counties, north-east and the south-west appear more downbeat about their ability to cope,\u201d Hopley said. Exchange rate volatility, political uncertainty and the prospect of increased costs on the back of a weaker pound were all causing concern for manufacturers, the lobby group said. \u201cWith a solid business environment, supportive policies and the right outcome from Brexit negotiations allowing for trade and ongoing access to skilled workers, manufacturers should be able to overcome the risks, reap future growth rewards and get their business confidence back on track,\u201d it added. Tom Lawton, manufacturing head at the report\u2019s co-author, BDO, said there had been encouraging signs from the new government of support for the sector. \u201cThe lack of a clear strategy for the manufacturing sector over recent years has been of huge concern and it is encouraging to see Theresa May\u2019s promise of a proper industrial strategy,\u201d said Lawton. \u201cWe would like to see the government match manufacturers\u2019 long-term outlook by developing a 15 to 20 year industrial policy that avoids the disruptions of the political cycle.\u201d",

Despite the economic uncertainly created by the UK vote to leave the EU, Ryanair said this week that it remained on track to post a record annual profit. The airline \u2013 Europe\u2019s largest by passenger numbers \u2013 expected to make a profit of as much as \u00a31.2bn for the year to March 2017. The forecast was in marked contrast to easyJet, which said last week that it could not give a profit forecast in the aftermath of the Brexit vote, the attack in Nice and an attempted coup in Turkey. Germany\u2019s Lufthansa has also issued a profit warning. \u2022 This article was amended on 1 August 2016. An earlier version said that adults travelling with children under 12 will have to pay to reserve a seat at a cost of \u00a38. In fact one adult per party needs to pay for a reserved seat when travelling with children under 12, at a cost of \u00a34.",

      "bodyText": "The luxury property tycoon Christian Candy has insisted he gave his brother Nick gifts worth more than \u00a3200m out of family affection and respect for the dying wishes of their late father \u2014 and not as part of an alleged plot to evade tax. The largesse Christian handed to his business partner brother include a penthouse apartment at One Hyde Park, where Nick lives with his pop singer wife Holly Valance; the couple\u2019s future family home, a grade II-listed mansion in Chelsea; and \u00a310m in cash. Loans from Christian\u2019s business empire have also been used, in part, to help Nick buy a \u00a326m, 60-metre Italian yacht called 11-11. The multi-millionaire brothers, who are Conservative party donors, have been forced to provide a rare glimpse into their relationship \u2014 both business and personal \u2014 as part of a bitter legal dispute over a loan to another property developer, Mark Holyoake. They say Holyoake is making allegations about tax evasion to force settlement of his claim and detract from business problems of his own. Witness statements from Nick and Christian Candy were submitted to the high court in London after questions were raised about how Nick came by his personal fortune, and the role he played in his brother\u2019s CPC Group. A highly profitable property empire, CPC \u2014 which takes its name from Christian\u2019s initials \u2014 is best known for super-luxe London developments such as One Hyde Park, where the sale of apartments brought in \u00a32bn. In court Nick has been accused of secretly owning and running CPC jointly with Christian, receiving income from the business secretly in order to evade tax. This is vehemently denied. In their written statements, the brothers confirm that the costly lifestyle led by London-based Nick could not be supported by income from his interior design business, which produced comparatively modest profits. They show how Nick received three valuable gifts, as well as multimillion-pound loans, from his younger brother, who was until recently based in Monaco. Both brothers strongly reject accusations that such gifts amount to hidden income from Nick\u2019s alleged co-ownership of CPC. They deny Nick had a stake in the business or that he acted as a \u201cshadow\u201d director. The Candys provided the court with their explanations only after a judge noted in April that there was \u201ca disconnect\u201d between the \u201clavish billionaire lifestyle\u201d led by Nick and his apparent inability to finance such high living. The brothers told the court their statements were \u201cprivate and confidential and sensitive\u201d, and requested they not be made public. Applications from the Guardian and Times newspapers, however, ensured that these and other documents from the case were released in accordance with legal principles of open justice. Meanwhile, lawyers for the Candys have accused those bringing the lawsuit of attempting to use their claim to cause the brothers embarrassment and to instil fear that scrutiny of their affairs will spark a lengthy tax inquiry. The claim is being brought by Holyoake, who is seeking more than \u00a3132m over a loan dispute. Business arrangements between Nick and Christian are peripheral to his claim, but have nevertheless become a bitterly contested issue in court. Holyoake, who has known Nick since their student days together at Reading University, insists his former friend had told him on many occasions that he worked with his brother Christian on a 50/50 basis. In truth, Holyoake alleges, the brothers are effectively joint owners of CPC, hence Nick\u2019s considerable wealth. A spokesman for the Candys told the Guardian: \u201cThroughout this case Mark Holyoake has sought to make slanderous and entirely false allegations about Nick, Christian and CPC\u2019s businesses and tax responsibilities. He is doing so in a cynical attempt to force settlement of his claim.\u201d A full trial is scheduled to start in February of next year, when the brothers and Holyoake may be asked to enter the witness box and answer detailed questions about their version of events. Nick said in his witness statement he had personal wealth \u2014 his assets minus the value of loans \u2014 of \u00a3194m. The vast majority of this fortune, he acknowledged, was the result of gifts from his brother. \u201cChristian is a hugely successful businessman,\u201d Nick said in his witness statement. \u201cIn the wake of his success, Christian has \u2026 gifted to me some of his assets. \u201cHe did not have to do this \u2026 These gifts were made through his generosity, and also in line with the wishes of our father, who before he died \u2026 asked Christian to ensure that the two of us are equally wealthy.\u201d The same explanation was given by Christian in his statement. \u201cNick is my brother. We grew up together, have lived together, socialised together and done business together \u2026 Whilst we do not always agree on everything, blood is thicker than water.\u201d He confirmed gifts to Nick reflected their father\u2019s wish, expressed shortly before he died of cancer in September 2013, that the two sons achieve equal fortunes. In their witness statements, the brothers also hit back at accusations that Nick was acting as a shadow director of CPC. Nick explained that a misunderstanding may have arisen because his interior design firm had often worked alongside CPC on property developments. He had also occasionally become involved in CPC\u2019s affairs \u2014 though never controlling or directing the group. In these circumstances, Nick conceded \u201clanguage may well have been used loosely\u201d. Problems over confused language were first revealed in June last year when the Guardian published details from a promotional video for One Hyde Park. A memo from a CPC tax adviser warned that the video presented \u201chuge issues\u201d unless certain wordings used in the script were edited out or changed. Among the memo\u2019s recommendations was that Nick not be portrayed as acting in any way as the developer. Towards the end of the video, Christian had said: \u201cThis project [One Hyde Park] can\u2019t be built by just Nick and myself. We\u2019ve got a phenomenal team beneath us.\u201d Holyoake has seized upon language used by and about the brothers, claiming it points to the true nature of Nick\u2019s role at CPC. He has provided the court with a witness statement from another businessman who makes similar accusations. The Swiss-based private banker William Pym, a former friend and business partner of the Candys, said: \u201cNick would attend meetings, conference calls and was integral to the decision making process. Nick would email direct, be included by cc and respond to emails on all the transactions I have been involved in with CPC. \u201cNick \u2026 would tell anyone he could that he was a \u2018billionaire\u2019 and that he and Chris owned everything together. I have witnessed this, firsthand, on dozens of occasions.\u201d Lawyers for the Candys have suggested Pym\u2019s statement was influenced by a financial interest in siding with Holyoake, something Pym has denied.",

    "webTitle": "To show confidence, Philip Hammond should hang on to Lloyds shares | Nils Pratley", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Be grateful, dear retail investor, that George Osborne never got a chance to unleash his mass-market offer of shares in Lloyds Banking Group. The former chancellor had planned to sell discounted stock to the populace at 70p apiece, or thereabouts. Lloyds\u2019 shares now fetch just 52.5p in non-discounted form. The other side of the story, of course, is that Osborne did well to shift more than a few Lloyds shares to City institutions at prices that now look pretty only from the seller\u2019s point of view. The reduction in the state\u2019s stake from 43% in 2009 to 9% today was achieved at an average price of 79p. It is a rare of example of the City being a medium-term loser in a government sell-off. In January, \u201cmarket volatility\u201d was blamed for the postponement of the Lloyds retail offer. Now, Brexit has surely delayed the spectacle for ages. Philip Hammond, Osborne\u2019s successor, would be silly to attempt a revival at the current share price when he has a credible alternative strategy: do nothing. Brexit has dented the idea that Lloyds would suddenly turn into a dividend gusher, which is why the share price has fallen by 23% since the referendum. The bank\u2019s capital-generating capacity may have reduced by about a fifth owing to various technical tweaks, like adjustments to risk weights. Low interest rates, for even longer, won\u2019t help profit margins. And, if the UK\u2019s short-term growth prospects are weaker, so is Lloyds\u2019 earnings potential: as the country\u2019s biggest bank, it is a geared bet on the UK economy. But some details of Lloyds\u2019 tale are unaltered by Brexit. Disasters like provisions for PPI mis-selling are washing out of the system, which was the main reason why statutory pretax profits doubled to \u00a32.45bn in the first half of the year. Meanwhile, chief executive Ant\u00f3nio Horta-Os\u00f3rio can continue his attack on costs; another 3,000 posts are going. And, barring a serious crash in house prices, the mortgage book looks sound. Add it all up and Lloyds should still be able to afford a dividend this year of 2.55p a share, or maybe a touch more. It\u2019s just that a special dividend sweetener probably won\u2019t happen. But 2.55p equates to a dividend yield of 4.8%. That\u2019s not so bad. Hold the shares, Mr Hammond, if you want to signal confidence in the UK\u2019s post-Brexit prospects. Could Hinkley Point C yet be derailed? EDF of France has taken the plunge and will sign the contract to build a nuclear power station at Hinkley Point in Somerset. But should you really approve an \u00a318bn project on the basis of a 10-7 boardroom majority? That slim margin does not generate confidence. EDF\u2019s executives could not convince the workers\u2019 representatives on the board to show solidarity. And, before the crucial meeting, a state-appointed director resigned, saying Hinkley was \u201cvery risky\u201d. EDF\u2019s last finance director did the same a few months ago. It is still hard to believe this project will proceed, whatever is said about the decision being \u201cfinal\u201d. The UK has offered a contract to a company that looks fundamentally divided, is carrying a mountain of debt and is permanently at the call of a changing cast of French politicians. Meanwhile, our own National Audit Office has rightly questioned the economics of Hinkley, which look grotesque for UK consumers. This would be the world\u2019s most expensive power station, to be constructed to a design that is not even proven. Events could still derail this absurd adventure. Let\u2019s hope so. Rolls-Royce revs up but there\u2019s a way to go A share to have bought on 24 June was Rolls-Royce: it\u2019s up by almost a third since the referendum. Part of that bounce is mechanical. It\u2019s great to have half your costs in the UK when you are selling engines for dollars. The other part, which yielded a 13.5% rise in the share price on Thursday, is about confidence in management. Chief executive Warren East has clearly learned from his predecessors\u2019 mistakes. When he arrived from ARM Holdings a year ago, he set expectations low. He grumbled about accounting \u201cfog\u201d and pleaded for time to unpick a top-heavy management structure. The City was half-braced for yet another profits warning. In the event, yesterday\u2019s half-year numbers delivered the reverse. A break-even position was on the cards but Rolls produced underlying pretax profits of \u00a3104m. That was still 80% lower than a year ago, but East now sounds vaguely cheerful. The target was to achieve cost savings of \u00a3150m to \u00a3200m by the end of next year. At the current rate of progress, it will happen sooner. For his next trick, East may have to contain shareholders\u2019 excitement. Some may already be dreaming of the day that Rolls matches arch-rival General Electric\u2019s profit margins and boosts its annual profits by \u00a31bn. It\u2019s a nice ambition to pursue but, in a long-term business like engine manufacturing, progress is measured over decades.",

      "body": "<p>Be grateful, dear retail investor, that George Osborne never got a chance to unleash his mass-market offer of shares in Lloyds Banking Group. The former chancellor had planned to sell discounted stock to the populace at 70p apiece, or thereabouts. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jul/28/lloyds-bank-to-axe-3000-jobs-and-close-200-branches\">Lloyds\u2019 shares now fetch just 52.5p in non-discounted form</a>.</p> <p>The other side of the story, of course, is that Osborne did well to shift more than a few Lloyds shares to City institutions at prices that now look pretty only from the seller\u2019s point of view. The reduction in the state\u2019s stake from 43% in 2009 to 9% today was achieved at an average price of 79p. It is a rare of example of the City being a medium-term loser in a government sell-off.</p> <p>In January, \u201cmarket volatility\u201d was blamed for the postponement of the Lloyds retail offer. Now, Brexit has surely delayed the spectacle for ages. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/philip-hammond\">Philip Hammond</a>, Osborne\u2019s successor, would be silly to attempt a revival at the current share price when he has a credible alternative strategy: do nothing.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jul/28/lloyds-bank-to-axe-3000-jobs-and-close-200-branches\">Lloyds bank to axe 3,000 jobs and close 200 branches</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Brexit has dented the idea that Lloyds would suddenly turn into a dividend gusher, which is why the share price has fallen by 23% since the referendum. The bank\u2019s capital-generating capacity may have reduced by about a fifth owing to various technical tweaks, like adjustments to risk weights. Low interest rates, for even longer, won\u2019t help profit margins. And, if the UK\u2019s short-term growth prospects are weaker, so is Lloyds\u2019 earnings potential: as the country\u2019s biggest bank, it is a geared bet on the UK economy. </p> <p>But some details of Lloyds\u2019 tale are unaltered by Brexit. Disasters like provisions for PPI mis-selling are washing out of the system, which was the main reason why <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jul/28/lloyds-bank-to-axe-3000-jobs-and-close-200-branches\">statutory pretax profits doubled to \u00a32.45bn</a> in the first half of the year. Meanwhile, chief executive Ant\u00f3nio Horta-Os\u00f3rio can continue his attack on costs; another 3,000 posts are going. And, barring a serious crash in house prices, the mortgage book looks sound.</p> <p>Add it all up and Lloyds should still be able to afford a dividend this year of 2.55p a share, or maybe a touch more. It\u2019s just that a special dividend sweetener probably won\u2019t happen. But 2.55p equates to a dividend yield of 4.8%. That\u2019s not so bad. Hold the shares, Mr Hammond, if you want to signal confidence in the UK\u2019s post-Brexit prospects.</p> <h2>Could Hinkley Point C yet be derailed?</h2> <p>EDF of France has taken the plunge and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jul/28/hinkley-point-c-to-go-ahead-after-edf-board-approves-project\">will sign the contract to build a nuclear power station at Hinkley Point</a> in Somerset. But should you really approve an \u00a318bn project on the basis of a 10-7 boardroom majority?</p> <p>That slim margin does not generate confidence. EDF\u2019s executives could not convince the workers\u2019 representatives on the board to show solidarity. And, before the crucial meeting, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/jul/28/resignation-edf-director-hinkley-point-gerard-magnin\">a state-appointed director resigned</a>, saying Hinkley was \u201cvery risky\u201d. EDF\u2019s last finance director <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/mar/07/hinkley-point-c-nuclear-project-in-crisis-as-edf-finance-director-resigns\">did the same a few months ago</a>.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/damian-carrington-blog/2016/jul/28/hinkley-point-c-nuclear-plant-fails-all-tests-bar-the-politics\">Hinkley's nuclear plant fails all tests - bar the politics | Damian Carrington</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It is still hard to believe this project will proceed, whatever is said about the decision being \u201cfinal\u201d. The UK has offered a contract to a company that looks fundamentally divided, is carrying a mountain of debt and is permanently at the call of a changing cast of French politicians.</p> <p>Meanwhile, our own National Audit Office has rightly questioned the economics of Hinkley, which look grotesque for UK consumers. This would be the world\u2019s most expensive power station, to be constructed to a design that is not even proven.</p> <p>Events could still derail this absurd adventure. Let\u2019s hope so.</p> <h2>Rolls-Royce revs up but there\u2019s a way to go</h2> <p>A share to have bought on 24 June was Rolls-Royce: it\u2019s up by almost a third since the referendum. Part of that bounce is mechanical. It\u2019s great to have half your costs in the UK when you are selling engines for dollars. The other part, which yielded a 13.5% rise in the share price on Thursday, is about confidence in management.</p> <p>Chief executive Warren East has clearly learned from his predecessors\u2019 mistakes. When he arrived from ARM Holdings a year ago, he set expectations low. He grumbled about accounting \u201cfog\u201d and pleaded for time to unpick a top-heavy management structure. The City was half-braced for yet another profits warning.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jul/28/rolls-royce-to-cut-400-senior-management-jobs\">Rolls-Royce to cut 400 senior management jobs</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In the event, yesterday\u2019s half-year numbers delivered the reverse. A break-even position was on the cards but Rolls <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jul/28/rolls-royce-to-cut-400-senior-management-jobs\">produced underlying pretax profits of \u00a3104m</a>. That was still 80% lower than a year ago, but East now sounds vaguely cheerful. The target was to achieve cost savings of \u00a3150m to \u00a3200m by the end of next year. At the current rate of progress, it will happen sooner.</p> <p>For his next trick, East may have to contain shareholders\u2019 excitement. Some may already be dreaming of the day that Rolls matches arch-rival General Electric\u2019s profit margins and boosts its annual profits by \u00a31bn. It\u2019s a nice ambition to pursue but, in a long-term business like engine manufacturing, progress is measured over decades.</p>",

      "bodyText": "All-inclusive package holidays could become more popular as British holidaymakers try and avoid Brexit-related price rises, according to Thomas Cook. The travel company revealed on Thursday that it had slumped to a quarterly loss and would miss annual profit targets after terrorist attacks in Turkey hit trade. Thomas Cook reported a \u00a325m pretax loss on operations in the three months to 30 June, compared with a \u00a33m profit in the same period a year before, after revenues slid 8% to \u00a31.85bn. It now expects an annual profit of \u00a3300m compared with previous forecasts of between \u00a3310m and \u00a3335m. Despite the warning, shares in Thomas Cook rose 6.5% to 63.9p as investors appeared relieved trading was not worse and chief executive Peter Fankhauser suggested Thomas Cook could benefit from a change in holiday habits. \u201cPackage holidays are already popular but they could become even more popular in this environment, because of the uncertainty on price movement and, in this volatile environment that we are taking care [of holidaymakers] whatever happens at their destination,\u201d Fankhauser said. The value of the pound has sunk 12% against the the dollar and 9% against the euro since the UK voted to exit the EU last month, potentially raising the cost of holiday spending money, hotels and travel abroad. But Fankhauser said Thomas Cook had hedged its currency arrangements until next autumn so that its holiday prices would not change. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t cost people more to go with us,\u201d he said. Thomas Cook\u2019s bookings from the UK were down 1% in the three months to the end of June, but the company said it expected a strong start to the winter season in the UK, with bookings up by 19% despite Brexit worries. Analysts at Mintel had predicted more growth in independent city breaks rather than package holidays this year but Fergal McGivney, travel analyst for the market research firm, says any recession might alter the outlook. With heavy competition for a more limited number of package destinations, as carriers switch away from Turkey and Egypt, prices have come down and more people have already opted to take a charter flight this year. Any recession or drop in the value of the pound is only likely to increase price competition as companies try to persuade families to go abroad rather than opting for a staycation in the UK. \u201cEverything is up in the air following Brexit but if there is a recession it could give package holidays a boost,\u201d McGivney said. But he said he didn\u2019t think the boost would be as strong as the last recession as competition from budget players such easyJet and Ryanair was strong. In the three months to the end of June, overall bookings at Thomas Cook slid 5% as a jump in travel to Spain and the US failed to offset a drop in holidays to Turkey, Egypt and Tunisia, all of which have been hit by terrorist attacks. So far this year bookings to Turkey were down by up to 40% after Thomas Cook cut the number of flights to the country. The numbers reflected a 41% drop in tourists visiting Turkey in June, revealed by Ankara\u2019s tourist ministry on Thursday \u2013 its worst-ever single monthly decline. Thomas Cook also booked \u00a360m less business from Belgium after a bombing at Brussels airport in March disrupted travel and made locals nervous about holidaying abroad. Thomas Cook said it expected holidaymakers to switch to Spain, Bulgaria, Greece, Cuba and the US as alternatives to Turkey and Egypt. Fankhauser said: \u201cWe are operating in a challenging geopolitical environment, with repeated disruption in some of our key source and destination markets. In addition, while Brexit has had no noticeable impact on our bookings so far, it has added to a general sense of uncertainty \u2013 for our business and our customers alike.\u201d",

However, I am pleased to say that, as a response to these kinds of scandals, some businesses are deciding to prove their socially responsible credentials and differentiate themselves clearly. The B Corp movement (which stands for Benefit Corporation, bcorporation.uk) is a body of businesses that have voluntarily committed to putting societal and environmental needs alongside financial ones with equal priority. We go through a rigorous certification process to give employees and customers confidence that they are dealing with positive, purposeful businesses. Currently the movement contains businesses of all sizes, from startups to global multinationals such as Ben &amp; Jerry\u2019s, Etsy and Ella\u2019s Kitchen. What we all share is a view that business can and should play a positive role in the world. Theresa May has publicly declared she is committed to making capitalism \u201cwork for all of us\u201d. I would urge her to look at the recommendations in the mission-led business review led by the Cabinet Office, where many B Corps have submitted their views on how to make the system fairer for good businesses, and better for customers and employees. Simon McEvoy Three Point Zero, Ely, Cambridgeshire \u2022 Aditya Chakrabortty lets off one of the guilty parties too lightly in his excruciatingly honest account of the failures of British business: the politicians who have for the past decade hero-worshipped the class of business entrepreneurs. They have seemed like so many second-rate Ayn Rands in their failure to see anything but good in the class of business billionaires. What is most depressing is their lack of action in the face of countless cases of sharp practice. Surely the contempt that both Mike Ashley and Philip Green have demonstrated in their manner towards parliament is justified, in that our parliamentary legislators are afraid to say boo to the business goose. Our current politicians compare unfavourably with their Victorian predecessors, who, in response to financial disasters such as the failure of Overend, Gurney &amp; Company in 1866, which ruined thousands, took action to ensure that such disasters would never happen again. Today\u2019s politicians prefer procrastination and handwringing to effective action. Even when legislative action is taken, as in the reforms of banking practice, the offenders \u2013 the banks \u2013 are allowed to delay and neutralise any legislation that would eliminate the worst of their bad practice. Derrick Joad Leeds \u2022 \u201cPhilip Green threatens to sue\u201d (Report, 26 July), while Theresa May does what? Tackling \u201cirresponsible behaviour in big business\u201d (May) will take far more than stripping one plutocrat of his knighthood or even putting employees on boards. The nitty-gritty of executive pay is determined by remuneration committees, so reform of these is the key. Currently, these may consist of just two or three directors. Employees at every level should be represented and their brief should be to recommend pay within narrower limits for all employees. Chief executive pay of the top 100 FTSE companies is officially at an average of \u00a35m a year and other executives clock up at least six-figure salaries. The reality is far worse because most executives multiply that several-fold through share takes and bonuses. To tackle this inequality, a tax on large shareholders is essential. Modest reforms are mere window dressing. Quentin Deakin Tywyn, Gwynedd \u2022 The collapse of BHS is as much a story of a broken system as it is of dazzling personalities (Editorial, 26 July). Monday\u2019s select committee report revealed the prominent role played by British overseas tax havens such as the British Virgin Islands. Coming in the wake of countless corporate tax scandals and the revelations of the Panama Papers, it was the latest demonstration that the international tax system is broken. As ever, it is poor countries that suffer. Developing countries are estimated to lose $200bn every year to corporate tax avoidance, leaving them deprived of the resources they need to fight poverty. The prime minister\u2019s pledge to tackle corporate tax avoidance is welcome but concrete steps must be taken to follow through on this commitment. Bold action is needed to champion fairer global tax rules, tackle UK overseas tax havens and stop companies artificially shifting profits around the world to cut their tax bill. Barry Johnston Acting director of policy, ActionAid UK \u2022 Unless you had a mole in BHS for months \u2013 Zoe Williams, perhaps, or Rhiannon Lucy Cosslett \u2013 you should sign up the anonymous author of Diary of a BHS worker (G2, 26 July). Her account is terrific, hitting exactly the right note of despair and disillusionment. It would be far better than working at Wilko, and the Guardian would get a new voice. I hope you\u2019ve had lots of letters saying the same. Next, a confidential account of being Philip Green\u2019s secretary?

What is most depressing is their lack of action in the face of countless&#xa0;cases of sharp practice.</p> <p>Surely the contempt that both Mike Ashley and Philip Green have demonstrated in their manner towards parliament is justified, in that our parliamentary legislators are afraid to say boo to the business goose. Our current politicians compare unfavourably with their Victorian predecessors, who, in response to financial disasters such as the failure of Overend, Gurney &amp; Company in 1866, which ruined thousands, took action to ensure that such disasters would never happen again. Today\u2019s politicians prefer procrastination and handwringing to effective action.

Tackling \u201cirresponsible behaviour in big business\u201d (May) will take far more than stripping one plutocrat of his knighthood or even putting employees on boards. The nitty-gritty of executive pay is determined by remuneration committees, so reform of these is the key. Currently, these may consist of just two or three directors. Employees at every level should be represented and their brief should be to recommend pay within narrower limits for all employees. Chief executive pay of the top 100 FTSE companies is officially at an average of \u00a35m a year and other executives clock up at least six-figure salaries. The reality is far worse because most executives multiply that several-fold through share takes and bonuses. To tackle this inequality, a tax on large shareholders is essential.

      "bodyText": "Ford has warned it is considering closing factories and raising prices in the UK and Europe in the wake of Britain\u2019s vote to leave the European Union. Announcing disappointing results on Thursday, the motor company forecast that the referendum decision could cost the company $1bn over the next two years. Ford is the largest car brand in the UK and Bob Shanks, Ford\u2019s chief financial officer, warned price rises would be necessary there in order to offset currency fluctuations in the wake of Brexit. The pound has crashed 11% against the dollar since the Brexit vote on 23 June. Sterling\u2019s devaluation and an expected slowdown in UK car sales would cost Ford $200m this year and another $400m to $500m each year over the next two years, said Shanks. \u201cWe\u2019re going to have to look more at cost,\u201d he said. The company would find a way to \u201cclaw that back\u201d. Shanks\u2019 comments are likely to stoke further fears about the fate of the UK car market in the wake of Brexit. Trade deals will now have to be renegotiated with the rest of Europe leading some analysts to speculate car firms may delay or cancel plans to expand in the UK or quit altogether. Ford has two remaining manufacturing plants in the UK, at Dagenham and Bridgend. Asked if the group would shut its remaining UK manufacturing operations after Brexit, Shanks said: \u201cEverything is going to be on the table across Europe\u201d. Ford\u2019s net income fell 9% to $2bn in the second quarter as the company\u2019s China sales weakened and the company failed to match better results from last year. The company has bounced back from near collapse during the recession. Its operating profit for the first half of the year was a record $6.8bn. But as business appears to slow, its success has led to tough comparisons for the company. Ford, which has previously announced that it expects to make a pretax profit of $10-$11bn this year, acknowledged that this guidance is at risk as China\u2019s economy slows and the ramifications of Brexit become clearer. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing elevated economic risk for the most part globally, and particularly, in what is happening with Brexit,\u201d Shanks said, speaking to reporters at the company\u2019s headquarters. For the quarter Europe, which has long been a dark spot for Ford, outperformed with sales rising 11%. Pretax profits in Europe almost tripled to $467m thanks in part to stronger sales in Russia. In North America sales were flat from a year ago and Shanks said that Ford\u2019s record-breaking recovery in the US had plateaued. \u201cWe don\u2019t see growth, at least in the near term,\u201d Shanks said. The company lowered its estimates for full-year industry sales in the US and said next year\u2019s sales will be even weaker. In Asia, Ford recorded its first pretax loss of $8m in more than three years. Shanks said Ford sold fewer commercial vehicles in China and spent heavily on engineering and warranty costs. The weaker yuan also impacted sales of its luxury Lincoln brand. Ford\u2019s losses in South America also more than doubled to $265m because of continuing economic issues in the region. The profit, of 52 cents per share, compared to a profit of 54 cents per share in the April-June period year ago. That missed Wall Street\u2019s expectation of a profit of 60 cents per share, according to analysts polled by FactSet. Revenue was up 6% to $39.5bn. Automotive revenue of $37bn beat analysts\u2019 expectations. Ford sold 1.7m vehicles during the quarter, which was flat from a year ago. Ford\u2019s automotive operating margin fell from 8.4% in the second quarter last year to 7.7% this year. Its North American operating margin fell from 12.2% to 11.3%.

    "webTitle": "Lloyds bank to axe 3,000 jobs and close 200 branches", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Lloyds Banking Group is axing 3,000 jobs and closing 200 branches as customers desert the high street for digital channels in a move that allows it to save costs at a time when interest rates are expected to be cut after the Brexit vote. The job cuts come on top of 54,000 announced since the rescue of HBOS in 2008 and sparked an angry reaction from unions, which warned about the impact on customers. The latest cutbacks to the remaining 75,000-strong workforce were revealed as the 9% taxpayer-owned bank reported a doubling in pre-tax profits and admitted it was being investigated by the Financial Conduct Authority over the way it handled customers having difficulty paying their mortgages. The UK\u2019s biggest mortgage lender and savings institution was unable to say whether it faced a penalty from the City regulator, but it has set aside \u00a3350m to cover the costs of mishandling customers in arrears not only with their home loans but also with unsecured debts. Ant\u00f3nio Horta-Os\u00f3rio, Lloyds\u2019s chief executive, said the decision to cut jobs \u2013 which will save \u00a3400m \u2013 had been tough. But he said the use of branches had fallen by 15% year on year, faster than had been the case when he announced a \u00a31bn cost-saving programme of 200 branch closures and 9,000 job cuts in October 2014. He refuted a warning by an official at Unite that customer service would be damaged. Rob MacGregor, Unite national officer, described the cuts as \u201cgrim news\u201d, while Ged Nichols, general secretary of the Accord union, which represents 22,000 staff who joined Lloyds from Halifax, said staff would be confused. \u201cThe loyal, dedicated and customer-focused employees in the Lloyds Banking Group are still reeling from recent job losses,\u201d said Nichols. \u201cThey will be bewildered by today\u2019s news and wonder what has happened that is so catastrophic that these further job cuts and branch closures are necessary. Interest rates might be lower for longer, but why are job losses higher and faster? Where will the axe fall next?\u201d Horta-Os\u00f3rio \u2013 born in Portugal, who has taken British nationality \u2013 said he expected the vote for Brexit to cause a \u201cdeceleration of growth\u201d in a period of uncertainty. Interest rates would likely be cut to 0.25% from their historic low of 0.5%, he said, but should not go below zero because of the negative signal this would send about the economy. He would not say how long he expected rates to remain at that level. \u201cAdditional monetary measures will have only a marginal impact,\u201d said Horta-Os\u00f3rio, who urged the government to consider an infrastructure programme to bolster productivity. \u201cThis country has underinvested for years ... The productively problem is already an issue. We can borrow almost at zero.\u201d Insisting that the vote for Brexit would not cause the bank to alter its lending criteria or strategy, Horta-Os\u00f3rio said: \u201cWe should focus on helping the country to grow and get out of this uncertainty as quickly as possible in the best possible way.\u201d. He refused to confirm the bank would pass on the full effect of any rate cut to borrowers or require savers to take a knock to their income. While first half pre-tax profits doubled to \u00a32.5bn, Horta-Os\u00f3rio focused on the underlying profits \u2013 which exclude restructuring costs and other items \u2013 that were down 5% at \u00a34.1bn. While he said the acceleration of the branch closure programme was motivated by customers increasingly banking online or digitally, analysts were calculating the impact of an interest rate cut on its profits and ability to generate surplus capital to pay out in dividends. A quarter-point cut at next week\u2019s monetary policy committee meeting would knock \u00a3100m off annual profits while the bank\u2019s finance director, George Culmer, admitted that the plunge in the pound to 31-year lows had reduced the amount of capital the bank holds as it increases the value of its riskiest assets. But the Brexit vote had also led to \u00a310bn of deposits being placed with the bank. As a result of buying HBOS \u2013 which includes the former Halifax building society \u2013 Lloyds has 2.7 million retail investors and is paying a 0.85p pence per share dividend, up 13%. The prospect of special dividends had helped propel the share price last year \u2013 when George Osborne had promised to sell the remaining taxpayer stake to the public at a discount. It is not clear how his successor, Philip Hammond, would tackle any selloff given the fall in the share price since the Brexit vote, which at one point plunged below 50p. The taxpayer took what was a 43% stake in the bank at an average price of 73p and after the results were down 5% at 52p. \u201cLloyds has increased its interim dividend significantly, but if the Brexit axe is to fall anywhere it\u2019s likely to be on the special dividend at the end of the year,\u201d said Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at stock broker Hargreaves Lansdown.",

      "bodyText": "After the Federal Reserve kept US interest rates on hold and ahead of a decision by the Bank of Japan, stock markets fell back after their recent highs. Falling oil prices and disappointing results from the likes of Royal Dutch Shell and Lloyds Banking Group also hit sentiment. Investors were nervous ahead of the European bank stress test results due on late on Friday. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished down 29.37 points or 0.44% at 6721.06 Germany\u2019s Dax dipped 0.43% to 10,274.93 France\u2019s Cac closed down 0.59% at 4420.58 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB fell 2.02% to 16,522.64 on worries about the country\u2019s banks ahead of the stress tests Spain\u2019s Ibex ended 2.1% lower at 8479.2 In Greece, the Athens market lost 1.11% to 562.84 On Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 72 points or 0.4%. On that note, it\u2019s time to close up. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. Markets are in wait and see mode ahead of the Bank of Japan rate decision later, but oil continues to fall on renewed worries about oversupply and weak demand. West Texas Intermediate - the US benchmark has now fallen 20% since its June highs, indicating a bear market. Meanwhile in the UK the FTSE 100 is down just 7 points while the Dow Jones Industrial Average is 74 points lower after the Federal Reserve kept US interest rates on hold but hinted at possible rises later in the year. Joshua Mahony, market analyst at IG, said: An unsurprisingly indecisive session in Europe has seen the likes of the FTSE largely flatlining as traders reduced their risk overnight ahead of the week\u2019s risk event from the Bank of Japan. Commodities have enjoyed a particularly volatile second half of this week, with crude continuing to tumble heavily on a global supply glut alongside evidence that fund managers are heavily shorting crude prices. Tonight\u2019s Bank of Japan meeting has been the focal point of the week despite yesterday\u2019s Fed announcement. One of the main reasons for the post-referendum rally has been the promise of easing from the likes of the ECB, Bank of England and Bank of Japan. With the overnight index swap markets rating the chance of a Bank of England rate cut at 100% next week, it seems like a matter of time until we see some sort of action. However, given that we have seen the post-referendum rally stall after weeks of inaction in Europe, there is a feeling that the FTSE is waiting for some form of stimulus to spark another leg higher. The IMF has been criticised for its handling of the eurozone crisis...by the IMF. Larry Elliott reports: The IMF\u2019s handling of the financial crisis in the eurozone has been criticised by the organisation\u2019s own independent watchdog in a report that says the fund failed to spot the scale of the problem, was guilty of over-optimistic forecasts and left the impression that it was treating Europe differently. While accepting that sorting out the problems of Greece, Ireland and Portugal \u201cposed extraordinary challenges\u201d, the IMF\u2019s Independent Evaluation Office (IEO) said the fund had missed the buildup of banking system risks in some countries and shared the widely held \u201cEurope is different\u201d mindset. The report looked into how the IMF handled the eurozone crisis, which began with the May 2010 bailout of Greece, but subsequently spread to Ireland, Portugal and Cyprus. It found that the \u201cIMF\u2019s pre-crisis surveillance identified the right issues but did not foresee the magnitude of the risks that would later become paramount\u201d. The full story is here: The vast majority of Irish small to medium enterprises believe Brexit is a threat to their business, writes Henry McDonald in Dublin: A survey released today by the British-Irish Chamber of Commence found that out of 400 Irish SMEs 262 of them see Brexit as a threat with far fewer envisaging the post-EU future as an opportunity The research also polled 88 British SMEs who do major business in Ireland. John McGrane, the Director General of the Chamber stressed that the Irish SME sector, which is the largest part of the Republic\u2019s economy, still see the UK as key to their business despite Britain leaving the EU. McGrane said the uncertainty within Irish SME\u2019s over what to do next after the Brexit vote required \u201cjoined up support\u201d from both the Irish and British government and their relevant agencies. He added: \u201cBusiness wants collaborative thinking and the Chamber stands ready to support its members, and Government, to continue to protect and grow the deep trade linkages between the UK and Ireland. We\u2019re ready to join up with likeminded agencies and organisations to ensure all businesses get the most joined-up supports they need to confront the uncertainties, and opportunities, ahead.\u201d The survey was conducted over the weeks following the EU referendum. The expectation of an interest rate cut by the Bank of England continues to put pressure on sterling. The pound has fallen 1% against the euro, hitting a two week low of 84.48p a euro. Against the dollar it is currently down 0.58% at $1.3142. Back with Brexit, and ratings agency S&amp;P Global says the decision to leave the European Union should have little impact on the UK\u2019s project finance initiative. It said: We analyse the effect of Brexit on our U.K. portfolio of over 50 rated transactions, in particular the potential repercussions of a higher inflationary environment, weaker economic growth, and the change in the credit quality of revenues and financial counterparties. While we believe that the risks of adverse economic developments in the U.K. have increased, we expect U.K. private finance initiative (PFI) projects will maintain their credit strength. A day after the US Federal Reserve kept interest rates on hold but suggested there could be a possible hike later this year, US stock markets have slipped lower in early trading. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 44 points or 0.22%, while the S&amp;P 500 has slipped 0.29% and Nasdaq 0.14%. Ahead of eurozone GDP figures on Friday, new data from Belgium has shown the country\u2019s economy growing by 0.5% quarter on quarter, despite terrorist attacks and strikes. That compares to 0.2% growth in the first quarter, and analyst expectations of a 0.3% increase. Year on year, the economy grew by 1.4%. Economist Peter Vanden Houte at ING Bank said: According to the Ministry of Economic Affairs the negative impact of the March 22 terrorist attacks in Brussels on hotels, catering and retail trade amounted to about \u20ac180m for the first half of this year. This probably shaved off around 0.1 percentage points from second quarter GDP growth. On top of that, the second quarter saw a rather tense social climate, with several strikes, most notably in public transport. This also weighed on growth. While the GDP components have not been published yet, the improvement in sentiment in industry seems to point to a positive contribution from investment and export. Residential construction most likely also contributed positively. With the situation on the labour market continuing to improve, consumption has probably also expanded, though some negative impact of the terrorist attacks seems likely. All in all today\u2019s figure seems hopeful, as it confirms that the Belgian economy still has some underlying momentum, putting in a strong performance despite the terrorist attacks and the strikes. Certainly, with Brexit and potentially a somewhat tighter fiscal policy, there are new headwinds that might hamper growth in the second half, but we believe that even then a quarterly growth pace of around 0.2% to 0.3% should be feasible. We will await further data confirmation in the coming weeks, but on the back of today\u2019s figures we are likely to have to revise our estimate for Belgian GDP growth upwards to 1.4% (from 1.2%). Earlier, US jobless claims rose by more than expected last week, according to the Labor Department. The number of Americans claiming unemployment benefits grew by 14,000 to 266,000, compared to expectations of an increase to 260,000. The previous week\u2019s level was revised down by 1,000 to 252,000. Weekly claims have been below 300,000, which is seen as a sign of a healthy labour market, for 73 consecutive weeks. Over in Paris, an EDF board member has resigned shortly before the energy company announce whether it will push on with plans to build a new nuclear plant at Britain\u2019s Hinkley Point. Gerard Magnin said the project was risky, and would undermine France\u2019s efforts to develop renewable energy technology. Magnin\u2019s resignation may be a sign that EDF will stick with Hinkley. An announcement is expected later today. Over in America, tech giant Oracle has swooped on cloud computing pioneer NetSuite in a $9.3bn deal. The deal should boost Oracle\u2019s web services offering; its founder, Larry Ellison, is also NetSuite\u2019s largest shareholder. Newsflash from Germany: the country\u2019s inflation rate has jumped to 0.4% this month, up from 0.2% in June. That\u2019s the highest level since January, which should pleas the European Central Bank in its battle to ward off deflation. The overall eurozone inflation reading is due at 10am BST tomorrow. Alex Stubb, Finlands\u2019s former prime minister and finance minister, has warned that it will take a long time for the Brexit drama to play out. Speaking on Bloomberg TV, Stubb said Europe was facing one of its biggest events in decades. It\u2019s a 1952 moment, when the Coal and Steel Community was created, or 1989 when the Cold War ended. This is huge for Europe, there\u2019s no denying it. Stubb, a veteran of the eurozone debt crisis, says Europe is following its usual three-stage approach to Brexit \u2013 first crisis, then chaos, and finally a sub-optimal solution. He adds: It\u2019s going to be a long, long process. What we get at the end of the day, I don\u2019t know. Eurozone companies have defied the fall in consumer confidence, and are actually a little more optimistic this month. The EC\u2019s economic sentiment indicator has risen to 104.6 in July from 104.4 in June. Anna Zabrodzka, economist at Moody\u2019s Analytics, says it shows \u201cresilience\u201d to the Brexit vote. Other persistent worries such as the slowing Chinese economy, the immigration wave, and continued tensions with Russia also seem to made little impact on the confidence of consumers and businesses in the euro area. However, risks are skewed to the downside.\u201d Consumer confidence across Europe has fallen this month, driven by a sharp slump in the UK. That\u2019s according to the European Commission\u2019s monthly healthcheck on consumer morale, which fell to -7.9 this month from -7.2 in June. UK consumer confidence, which had been riding relatively high, took a real tumble: The dramatic events of the last few weeks have sent some of us staggering towards the drinks cabinet. But Diageo, the UK-based alcoholic beverages giant, is worried that the Brexit vote may hit sales of its whisky brands overseas, once Britain leaves the EU. Ivan Menezes, chief executive of Diageo, told CNBC that Scotland\u2019s whisky industry is dependent on global trade: Out of Brexit, our focus is really on ensuring that we keep Scotch whisky healthy. The trade agreements in Europe and around the world. You know, Johnnie Walker was in over 100 markets, long before Coca Cola left the shores of America.\u201d As well as Johnnie Walker, Diageo also produces Bell\u2019s whisky, plus several single malts including Talisker and Lagavulin. More Brexit gloom. JCDecaux, the French outdoor advertising group, has said it is likely to cut back its UK investment plans following the decision to leave the EU. JCDecaux, which installs those massive screens at railway stations, airports and London bus shelters, says: Given the uncertainty surrounding the impact of the Brexit decision on the UK economy and advertising revenue, we are reviewing the number of screens we are deploying until we can evaluate the economic conditions and have improved visibility. Union leaders are urging the UK government to act urgently to protect the economy from the impact of the Brexit vote. TUC General Secretary Frances O\u2019Grady says: \u201cThe growing expectation since the Brexit vote of an economic slowdown seems to be a factor. The government needs to act now to secure jobs and investment before thousands of working people pay the price of Brexit with the loss of their job. And Rob MacGregor of Unite is alarmed by Lloyds\u2019s decision to cut an extra 3,000 jobs: \u201cThis announcement is very bad news for workers and their families, and more widely it is a further body blow to the UK economy. \u201cThese are permanent jobs that are being lost. As a country, we can\u2019t afford to lose these jobs in a challenging post-Brexit world. As well publishing half year results which reveal job cuts and branch closures, Lloyds Banking Group has also admitted it is being investigated by the Financial Conduct Authority over the way it handles customers facing difficulty paying their mortgages. There is not much detail but in the results Lloyds said: \u201cIn May, the FCA informed the group that it was commencing an investigation in connection with the group\u2019s mortgage arrears handling. At this stage it is not possible to make an assessment of the outcome of this ongoing review\u201d. Lloyds did not take a provision for the payment protection misselling scandal. But in the first six months of the year the bank took a \u00a3460m to cover a range of so-called \u201cconduct issues\u201d. This included \u00a3215m \u201cin respect of arrears related activities on secured and unsecured retail products, \u00a370m in respect of complaints relating to packaged bank accounts and \u00a350m related to insurance products sold in Germany\u201d. In another worrying sign, a closely-watched survey of consumer confidence has hit its lowest level in three years after the Brexit vote. The monthly index conducted by YouGov and the Centre for Economics and Business Research (CEBR) has tumbled to 106.6, the lowest since July 2013, down from 111.3. That\u2019s the biggest one-month drop in six years. The survey found that the public are concerned about the impact of the June referendum, particularly on house prices (how very British!). Stephen Harmston, Head of YouGov Reports, says: \u201cThe public are still absorbing the EU referendum result but it is clear that consumer confidence has taken a significant and clear dive.\u201d Spain is celebrating the news that the country\u2019s jobless rate has hit its lowest level in six years, before the eurozone crisis began. However.... one in five adults are still out of work, and the situation could deteriorate if Europe\u2019s economy suffers from Brexit. Royal Dutch Shell is one of the biggest fallers on the FTSE 100 this morning, down 3% after posting a 70% tumble in earnings. It blamed the recent tumble in crude oil prices, which have eaten into its profitability. CEO Ben van Beurden warned shareholders that \u201clower oil prices continue to be a significant challenge across the business.\u201d Inchcape, the UK car dealership, has warned that demand for new cars is weakening, due to the Brexit vote. It told shareholders this morning: Ahead of the EU referendum, the second quarter New Vehicle market growth rate moderated to 1.0% from 5.1% in the first quarter. We expect this moderation of the New Vehicle market to persist into the second half of 2016. Building society Nationwide has reported that house prices were stable in July, rising 0.5% month-on-month. The average house cost \u00a3205,715, 5.2% higher than a year ago. However.... as mortgages are approved towards the end of the process, this doesn\u2019t whether buyers have been spooked by the Brexit vote. Engineering firm Rolls-Royce is also cutting jobs, after reporting an 80% tumble in profits in the first half of 2016. Today\u2019s losses mean Countrywide has shed a third of its value since the referendum, highlighting how the UK\u2019s property sector will suffer from Brexit. It\u2019s a bleak morning in the financial sector too, as Lloyds Banking Group slashes 3,000 jobs. The bank is speeding up its cost-cutting programme, and closing 200 branches as it enters a \u201cperiod of uncertainty\u201d following the Brexit vote. Our City editor Jill Treanor explains that Lloyds is also preparing for interest rates to be slashed next week: The bank is blaming changes to customer behaviour and anticipated cuts to interest rates following the vote for Brexit last month. Mark Carney, the Bank of England governor, signalled a rate cut would take place during the summer and the City now expects rates will be cut from their 0.5% historic low on 4 August. More here: And here\u2019s Reuters\u2019 take: Shares in Countrywide has dropped by almost 5% at the start of trading, following its Brexit-induced earnings warning. Britain\u2019s biggest lettings and estate agent group has issued a stark warning that parts of the country\u2019s property market are weakening, since last month\u2019s referendum, Countrywide, which runs 50 different high street brands, admitted that profits this year will be lower than in 2015. And it pins the blame firmly on the decision to leave the EU. According to Countrywide there was a clear market slowdown in May and June. And since the vote, commercial and London residential transactions have stalled, it says, with a \u201cless pronounced impact\u201d on other operations. The number of homes sold subject to contract in London fell 29% in April-June, compared to January-March. Alison Platt, Countrywide\u2019s CEO, says: As we stated in our last Trading Update on 26 April, we took a cautious view of the months leading up to the EU referendum and beyond. In the event, we saw a slowdown in our Retail and London residential businesses and, since the EU referendum result this has become more marked in London, the South East and expensive prime markets. The rest of the country has fared somewhat better and our Lettings business and mortgage trends have been largely unaffected. Countrywide also posted a 25% tumble in adjusted pretax profits for the first half of 2016, and warned of more challenges ahead. As Platt put it says: This period of uncertainty will inevitably impact the level of transactional activity in the second half of the year and, although it is too early to quantify accurately, we will not meet last year\u2019s result at the EBITDA level. Here\u2019s a round-up of Countrywide\u2019s brands: Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Five weeks after the European Union referendum, we\u2019re now seeing signs that the vote to leave the EU is hitting the UK economy. Three influential surveys released overnight have shown worrying signs that Britain\u2019s car industry, retail sector and building companies are all suffering from the Brexit vote. In a worrying cocktail, the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders said its members were gloomy about the prospects for growth, jobs and investment; the British Retail Consortium said jobs were being shed in the months leading up to the referendum; and RICS \u2013 the body that represents chartered surveyors \u2013 said workloads for construction had weakened. It\u2019s a clear signal that the uncertainty created by June\u2019s vote is starting to hit demand, confidence and activity. The SMMT\u2019s chief executive, Mike Hawes warned that Britain\u2019s car revival has been underpinned by \u201ctariff-free access to the single market\u201d, so losing that access would be a serious blow. Here\u2019s the full story: This all rather takes the shine off yesterday\u2019s forecast-beating growth figures, which showed the UK\u2019s GDP expanded by 0.6% in the last quarter. Also coming up... Investors are pondering whether the US central bank might manage to raise interest rates soon, despite the Brexit risk. Last night, the Federal Reserve declared that the US jobs recovery had picked up momentum, and the near-term risks to the US economy had diminished. Intriguingly,the Fed also declared that: \u201cNear-term risks to the economic outlook have diminished.\u201d Perhaps a hint that the EU referendum hasn\u2019t caused as much market mayhem as feared. Over in Paris, French energy company EDF is deciding whether to give the go-ahead for an \u00a318bn nuclear power station at Hinkley Point in Somerset. The rumours are that the project will go ahead, despite concerns over cost and safety: And there\u2019s a blizzard of corporate results this morning, sending my Reuters machine into overdrive as companies clear the decks before the August lull. That include Lloyds Banking Group, BT, Countrywide, Thomas Cook, Diageo, Rolls Royce, Royal Dutch Shell, BAE and Sky. We\u2019ll pick the best bits out...",

Joshua Mahony, market analyst at IG, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>An unsurprisingly indecisive session in Europe has seen the likes of the FTSE largely flatlining as traders reduced their risk overnight ahead of the week\u2019s risk event from the Bank of Japan. Commodities have enjoyed a particularly volatile second half of this week, with crude continuing to tumble heavily on a global supply glut alongside evidence that fund managers are heavily shorting crude prices.</p> <p>Tonight\u2019s Bank of Japan meeting has been the focal point of the week despite yesterday\u2019s Fed announcement. One of the main reasons for the post-referendum rally has been the promise of easing from the likes of the ECB, Bank of England and Bank of Japan. With the overnight index swap markets rating the chance of a Bank of England rate cut at 100% next week, it seems like a matter of time until we see some sort of action. However, given that we have seen the post-referendum rally stall after weeks of inaction in Europe, there is a feeling that the FTSE is waiting for some form of stimulus to spark another leg higher.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-579a1633e4b00eff095cd6b2\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/larryelliott\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-07-28T15:00:44.544Z\">4.00pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The IMF has been criticised for its handling of the eurozone crisis...by the IMF.

That compares to 0.2% growth in the first quarter, and analyst expectations of a 0.3% increase. Year on year, the economy grew by 1.4%. Economist Peter Vanden Houte at ING Bank said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>According to the Ministry of Economic Affairs the negative impact of the March 22 terrorist attacks in Brussels on hotels, catering and retail trade amounted to about \u20ac180m for the first half of this year. This probably shaved off around 0.1 percentage points from second quarter GDP growth. On top of that, the second quarter saw a rather tense social climate, with several strikes, most notably in public transport. This also weighed on growth.</p> <p>While the GDP components have not been published yet, the improvement in sentiment in industry seems to point to a positive contribution from investment and export. Residential construction most likely also contributed positively. With the situation on the labour market continuing to improve, consumption has probably also expanded, though some negative impact of the terrorist attacks seems likely.</p> <p>All in all today\u2019s figure seems hopeful, as it confirms that the Belgian economy still has some underlying momentum, putting in a strong performance despite the terrorist attacks and the strikes. Certainly, with Brexit and potentially a somewhat tighter fiscal policy, there are new headwinds that might hamper growth in the second half, but we believe that even then a quarterly growth pace of around 0.2% to 0.3% should be feasible. We will await further data confirmation in the coming weeks, but on the back of today\u2019s figures we are likely to have to revise our estimate for Belgian GDP growth upwards to 1.4% (from 1.2%).</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-579a0704e4b00eff095cd670\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-07-28T13:30:24.728Z\">2.30pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Earlier, US jobless claims rose by more than expected last week, according to the Labor Department.</strong></p> <p>The number of Americans claiming unemployment benefits grew by 14,000 to 266,000, compared to expectations of an increase to 260,000.

      "bodyText": "The IMF\u2019s handling of the financial crisis in the eurozone has been criticised by the organisation\u2019s own independent watchdog in a report that says the fund failed to spot the scale of the problem, was guilty of over-optimistic forecasts and left the impression that it was treating Europe differently. While accepting that sorting out the problems of Greece, Ireland and Portugal \u201cposed extraordinary challenges\u201d, the IMF\u2019s Independent Evaluation Office (IEO) said the fund had missed the buildup of banking system risks in some countries and shared the widely held \u201cEurope is different\u201d mindset. The report looked into how the IMF handled the eurozone crisis, which began with the May 2010 bailout of Greece, but subsequently spread to Ireland, Portugal and Cyprus. It found that the \u201cIMF\u2019s pre-crisis surveillance identified the right issues but did not foresee the magnitude of the risks that would later become paramount\u201d. The IEO added that by May 2010 the fund was worried about the risks of contagion and had to \u201cmodify\u201d its own rules to allow exceptional financing for the government in Athens. The terms of the bailouts for stricken eurozone countries were organised by the so-called troika of the IMF, the European commission and the European Central Bank. According to the IEO this was an efficient mechanism for conducting discussions with governments but at the expense of the IMF\u2019s \u201ccharacteristic agility as a crisis manager\u201d. Greece has seen the size of its economy shrink by about 30% over the past six years, a much worse performance than the fund anticipated. The IEO concluded that \u201cIMF-supported programmes in Greece and Portugal incorporated overly optimistic growth projections; lessons from past crises were not always applied\u201d. Noting that conducting the evaluation had been \u201cchallenging\u201d, the IEO said there had been a lack of clarity about what it could or could not evaluate. \u201cThe IMF\u2019s handling of the euro area crisis raised issues of accountability and transparency, which helped create the perception that the IMF treated Europe differently.\u201d The IEO made five specific recommendations, including that the fund\u2019s management and executive board should develop procedures to limit political meddling in the organisation\u2019s technical analysis; that processes should be strengthened to ensure agreed procedures are followed and only changed after careful deliberation; and that there should be a renewed commitment to accountability and transparency. Christine Lagarde, the fund\u2019s managing director, said: \u201cOverall, the conclusion I draw is that the fund\u2019s involvement in the euro area crisis has been a qualified success.\u201d Lagarde added that the crisis in the euro area was unprecedented and that fund-supported programmes had \u201csucceeded in buying time to build firewalls, preventing the crisis from spreading, and restoring growth and market access in three out of four cases\u201d (Ireland, Portugal and Cyprus). The IMF managing director admitted that with the benefit of hindsight, assumptions about growth in Greece had proved much too optimistic. \u201cGreece, however, was unique: while initial economic targets proved overly ambitious, the programme was beset by recurrent political crises, pushback from vested interests, and severe implementation problems that led to a much deeper than expected output contraction. \u201cOn the other hand, Greece undertook enormous adjustment with unprecedented assistance from its international partners. This enabled Greece to remain a member of the euro area \u2013 a key goal for Greece and the euro area members.\u201d Lagarde said she did not accept that there had been political interference in the fund\u2019s technical analysis but gave the IEO recommendations either full or qualified backing. \u201cIn summary, the crisis in the euro area was extraordinary,\u201d Lagarde said. \u201cIt posed unprecedented challenges that, with the global financial crisis providing tinder, could have rapidly spread through Europe and beyond. The fund, in conjunction with our membership, our partners in Europe, and the wider global community, took steps that averted what could have been a much more severe European and even global crisis.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Shares in Sports Direct, the embattled retailer founded and 55% owned by the billionaire Mike Ashley, have risen sharply after it announced an \u00a389m share purchase plan. The company said it would buy back up to 29.9m shares, or about 5% of the total, to reduce its share capital. Citigroup will conduct the buyback in the run-up to Sports Direct\u2019s annual meeting on 7 September, where it wants to gain support from shareholders for further buybacks. Sports Direct\u2019s share price rose just over 9% to close at 281.1p after the announcement on Thursday. The share price has fallen about 60% since August, with the company falling out of the FTSE 100 index of the UK\u2019s biggest publicly listed firms after facing criticism over its treatment of workers, revealed by a Guardian investigation last year. It has also had difficulties securing the acquisitions it needed to meet profit targets while sales growth has stumbled. The company issued its second profit warning in a year in March. Last week, a parliamentary committee report into Sports Direct\u2019s working practices found they were closer to those of a Victorian workhouse than a modern company, treating workers \u201cwithout dignity or respect\u201d. Trade unions have been seeking the backing of City investors for a resolution to be put to Sports Direct\u2019s AGM calling for a fully independent review of working practices at the retailer. Sports Direct did not comment on whether Ashley would be selling any of his holding, but market watchers expect him to hold onto all of his shares. If he does so, and Sports Direct buys back 5%, Ashley\u2019s stake will increase to around 58%, which some see as history repeating itself. Shortly after the group floated on the stock exchange in 2007, when Ashley sold 43% of the company to outside investors, the retailer\u2019s shares slumped and it swiftly launched a share buyback, which propelled Ashley\u2019s stake to around 70%. Earlier this month, the firm said it would not be paying a bonus to 3,000 permanent staff after underlying profits fell to \u00a3381.4m, missing the company\u2019s target of \u00a3420m in the year to 24 April. Ashley told the board he had no plans to take the company private, despite its disappointing performance. Rival JD Sports has fared better. It said on Thursday that headline profit before tax for the year ending 28 January 2017 would be at the top end of the \u00a3170m to \u00a3190m range. The chain has cashed in on demand for fashionable sports-inspired clothing known as \u201cathleisure\u201d, such as Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s Ivy Park line, and the recent Euro 2016 football tournament gave it a further sales boost. Sports Direct has been selling down its stake in JD Sports.",

      "bodyText": "Countrywide, the UK\u2019s biggest estate agent, has warned that its 2016 earnings will be lower than last year, saying commercial and London residential transactions have stalled after Britain voted to leave the European Union. However, growth in UK house prices was steady in July, with the average price of a home increasing by 0.5% to \u00a3205,715, according to Nationwide\u2019s monthly report on mortgage activity. Countrywide reported a 25% year-on-year fall in pretax profits for the first half of 2016, which it said had been affected by \u201cinvestment to underpin future growth\u201d and a slowdown in the housing market in May and June, before the EU referendum. Pretax profits for the first half were \u00a322m, with revenues up 9% to \u00a3370m. The firm forecast that it would not be able to match the adjusted earnings before interest, taxation, depreciation and amortisation (Ebitda) level seen in 2015, when it posted adjusted Ebitda of \u00a3113m. Alison Platt, Countrywide\u2019s chief executive, said the company had seen a slowdown in its retail and London residential businesses in the run-up to the 23 June referendum. \u201cSince the EU referendum result this has become more marked in London, the south-east and expensive prime markets. The rest of the country has fared somewhat better and our lettings business and mortgage trends have been largely unaffected,\u201d Platt added. \u201cThere has also been a slowdown in commercial transactions, but our consultancy revenues have remained stable. This period of uncertainty will inevitably impact the level of transactional activity in the second half of the year and, although it is too early to quantify accurately, we will not meet last year\u2019s result at the Ebitda level.\u201d Countrywide\u2019s share price was down nearly 3% in early trading on Thursday, before rebounding strongly. The share price was up about 14% by late morning at 282p \u2013 still well below the 352p level it was at on 23 June. Meanwhile, Nationwide\u2019s monthly survey showed house prices rose 0.5% in July, compared with a monthly gain of 0.2% in June. The annual growth rate edged up to 5.2% from 5.1% in June. Robert Gardner, Nationwide\u2019s chief economist, said: \u201cThis is the first month\u2019s data following the EU referendum. However, it is important to note that, in constructing the index, we use data at the mortgage offer stage \u2013 this means any impact from the vote may not be fully evident in July\u2019s figures, as there is a short lag between a buyer making the decision to purchase a property and applying for a mortgage.\u201d He said the outlook was \u201cunusually uncertain\u201d and it could take several months for underlying trends to emerge. \u201cIn the near term, increased economic uncertainty may lead to weaker demand for homes. Leading indicators are consistent with softening ahead. \u201cHousehold confidence fell sharply in the wake of the referendum result, especially attitudes towards making major purchases, which in the past has correlated with mortgage activity, though less closely in recent years.\u201d Gardner said how the labour market evolves would be crucial in determining the demand for homes in the months ahead. The decline in long-term interest rates to new all-time lows in recent weeks should help keep borrowing costs low, giving some support to demand. \u201cEven if there is a fall back in demand as a result of economic uncertainty, the impact on house prices is not certain, as potential sellers may also hold off from placing their properties on the market.\u201d Private rental prices grew by 2.5% in England in the 12 months to June, according to new data from the Office for National Statistics. They edged up 0.1% in Scotland and dipped 0.1% in Wales. The cost of renting went up in all English regions, with the biggest increase in the south east, of 3.4%. Jane Tully, of the Money Advice Trust, the charity that runs National Debtline, said: \u201cPrivate renters across the UK are under significant pressure, and across England in particular, the rises just keep on coming. This additional pressure on private renters\u2019 budgets represents a further squeeze on household finances, which in turn may affect the ability of some individuals to keep on top of other spending commitments.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "British Gas lost almost 400,000 customers in the first six months of 2016 as greater competition among suppliers encouraged households to switch. The company\u2019s parent, Centrica, said falling gas and power prices had brought new suppliers to the market, intensifying the rivalry for customers. The 3% fall in UK home customers was also the result of a significant number of long-term contracts coming to an end at the same time, leaving British Gas with 14.26m accounts. Customer numbers started rising again in June, it said. Claire Osborne, an energy analyst at the price comparison website uSwitch, said: \u201cEnergy suppliers big and small continue to eat away at British Gas\u2019s market share. The only way that British Gas can start to win back customers is by launching new, competitive deals. \u201cBritish Gas is the only major supplier to have made three cuts to standard gas prices since the start of last year, so its standard variable tariff is the lowest among the big six. However, its best deal is still almost \u00a3290 a year more than the cheapest on the market so customers are likely to find better savings by switching to other providers.\u201d Announcing results for the first half of 2016, Centrica said operating profit at its UK home business fell 6% to \u00a3635m. Roughly half of the profit fall was down to a one-off \u00a323m pension credit that boosted the numbers in the first half of 2015, but the fall also partly reflected lower energy consumption among customers. Total revenue across the group fell 13% to \u00a313.4bn. Centrica said it had cut \u00a3141m of costs in the first half, with savings of \u00a3750m planned by 2020. The company is in the process of cutting 6,000 jobs and it expects to reduce staff numbers by 3,000 by the end of this year. Iain Conn, Centrica\u2019s chief executive, said: \u201cThe first half of the year has been demanding for Centrica, but the response has been strong and I am encouraged by the progress we have made.\u201d The company also announced that it was appointing Stephen Hester, the former chief executive of Royal Bank of Scotland, as a senior independent director. Hester joined the company as a non-executive director on 1 June.",

      "body": "<p>British Gas lost almost 400,000 customers in the first six months of 2016 as greater competition among suppliers encouraged households to switch.</p> <p>The company\u2019s parent, <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/centrica\">Centrica</a>, said falling gas and power prices had brought new suppliers to the market, intensifying the rivalry for customers.</p> <p>The 3% fall in UK home customers was also the result of a significant number of long-term contracts coming to an end at the same time, leaving British Gas with 14.26m accounts. Customer numbers started rising again in June, it said.</p> <p>Claire Osborne, an energy analyst at the price comparison website uSwitch, said: \u201cEnergy suppliers big and small continue to eat away at British Gas\u2019s market share. The only way that British Gas can start to win back customers is by launching new, competitive deals.</p> <p>\u201cBritish Gas is the only major supplier to have made three cuts to standard gas prices since the start of last year, so its standard variable tariff is the lowest among the big six. However, its best deal is still almost \u00a3290 a year more than the cheapest on the market so customers are likely to find better savings by switching to other providers.\u201d</p> <p>Announcing results for the first half of 2016, Centrica said operating profit at its UK home business fell 6% to \u00a3635m. Roughly half of the profit fall was down to a one-off \u00a323m pension credit that boosted the numbers in the first half of 2015, but the fall also partly reflected lower energy consumption among customers. </p> <p>Total revenue across the group fell 13% to \u00a313.4bn.</p> <p>Centrica said it had cut \u00a3141m of costs in the first half, with savings of \u00a3750m planned by 2020. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/jul/30/british-gas-owner-centrica-cuts-thousands-of-jobs-group-shakeup\">The company is in the process of cutting 6,000 jobs</a> and it expects to reduce staff numbers by 3,000 by the end of this year.</p> <p>Iain Conn, Centrica\u2019s chief executive, said: \u201cThe first half of the year has been demanding for Centrica, but the response has been strong and I am encouraged by the progress we have made.\u201d</p> <p>The company also announced that it was appointing Stephen Hester, the former chief executive of Royal Bank of Scotland, as a senior independent director. <a href=\"https://www.centrica.com/about-us/governance/our-board-members/stephen-hester\">Hester joined the company as a non-executive director on 1 June.</a></p>",

      "bodyText": "Rolls-Royce is doubling the number of senior management job cuts for 2016 to 400 and forecasting a recovery in profits for the second half of the year. The Derby-based engineering group posted an 80% drop in first-half profits. Investors were cheered, however, that the company stuck to its view that profits would bounce back in the second half, suggesting its turnaround plan is bearing fruit after a series of profit warnings. The aero engine maker\u2019s shares rose nearly 19% on Thursday to 870p, the best performer on the FTSE 100 index in London. Warren East, the chief executive, said the company\u2019s order intake had been good. Its order book has swelled \u00a33.1bn to \u00a379.5bn since the end of last year, as it won deals from airlines including Norwegian, China Eastern, Virgin Atlantic and Gulf Air. It will launch the new Trent XWB-84 EP engine with Singapore Airlines in February. East said the transformation programme was also starting to deliver. The company made an underlying pretax profit of \u00a3104m in the first six months of the year, beating analysts\u2019 forecasts of a \u00a316m loss. On a statutory basis it was \u00a32.15bn in the red, as the pound\u2019s recent tumble against the dollar resulted in a \u00a32.2bn writedown at its US dollar hedge book. The City is expecting an underlying profit of \u00a3669m for the year as a whole. Rolls is stepping up the cull of senior managers, cutting almost a fifth of the 2,000 bosses worldwide. Half of the 400 job cuts are in the UK, mostly in Derby. About 270 people have already left the company, including 50 senior managers last Christmas. Rolls-Royce employs 23,000 people in the UK, including 14,000 in Derby. East said the firm was well on its way to achieving between \u00a3150m and \u00a3200m of cost savings a year by the end of 2017. This includes cutting lead times on the assembly of Trent engines, reducing the number of people attending meetings and the frequency of meetings. While thinning out management, the company has been hiring on the factory floor. It has 600 nuclear designers and engineers working on the reactors for the Successor nuclear missile submarine project, half of whom joined in the last two years. The House of Commons recently voted to renew the Trident programme, replacing four submarines that carry nuclear warheads. The hires form part of an increase in the nuclear submarine workforce by 900 to more than 3,000 at Raynesway, Derby. More than 700 people joined the division, which services the UK\u2019s existing fleet, last year, with two-thirds coming from other parts of the company. The rest will follow this year. East said: \u201cWe are not just firing. We are also hiring.\u201d The company announced in March that it was taking on 350 people at its factory in Derby to assemble its Trent XWB civilian aircraft engine. The company\u2019s revenues were down 5% in the first six months of the year on the back of a 25% fall in the marine business, the result of falling demand from oil and gas customers and a 5% fall in civil aerospace, the company\u2019s biggest division by revenue. Nuclear, the smallest division, posted a 14% increase. Rolls-Royce, which makes engines for Boeing\u2019s 787 Dreamliners and Airbus\u2019s A380 superjumbos, had issued five profit warnings in less than two years. It has been hit by the oil price slump and a decline in defence spending. Latith Kahalaf, an analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: \u201cKeeping the order book growing requires constant investment into new product development,\u201d he said. \u201cMr East seems to be taking steps in the right direction, however the road ahead could well be a long one.\u201d BAE Systems, which makes military equipment such as Astute submarines and Eurofighter jets, is also expected to benefit from the Trident decision. The company posted a near 5% increase in first half-profits to \u00a3408m from \u00a3390m a year earlier. The defence contractor is also benefiting from growing tensions between Nato governments and China and Russia, which have led to a reversal of the defence budget cuts made after the 2007/08 financial crisis and global recession. BAE\u2019s chief executive, Ian King, said: \u201cIn the United States, we are seeing encouraging signs of a return to growth in defence budgets and improved prospects for our core franchises. In the UK, the result of the EU referendum will lead to a period of uncertainty, but we do not anticipate any material near-term trading impact on our business.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Amid a deluge of company results, emerging markets lender International Personal Finance stands out by losing nearly a fifth of its value. The company said first half profits fell from \u00a343.3m a year ago to \u00a330.7m, hit by tougher legislation in Poland and a disappointing performance in Mexico which has prompted a restructuring in the country. It saw a strong performance in southern Europe and continued to invest in its digital business. At the end of last year the company saw its shares slump after an unexpected change in consumer legislation in Slovakia which led to its winding down its business in the country. Chief executive officer Gerard Ryan said: Our business is undergoing significant change as we address competition and regulation but our strategy reflects this changing dynamic and we are well placed to take advantage of growing demand within our target segmnent of consumers for digital loans. But its shares - which have been moving higher since June - have slumped 19.4% to 271.6p. Analyst Stuart Duncan at Peel Hunt moved from buy to hold and said: Although profits are broadly as expected, there is a relatively mixed underlying picture for IPF. The guidance on Poland remains unchanged, but performance in Mexico has remained disappointing and profits have fallen materially. This will offset, to some extent, the likely benefit from recent sterling weakness. The reduction in profitability in the first half largely reflects two specific issues. Firstly, profits in Poland were significantly affected, as expected, by the new legislation which was implemented in March. Profits fell by around 25%, with the guidance on the likely full-year impact unchanged at \u00a330m (of which half is expected to be mitigated). The statement reports that there has been little change in the competitive landscape in Poland, with the customer response to the new rule still unclear. The second point is the continued underperformance in Mexico, which was first flagged in the first quarter update. Profits fell materially, to just \u00a32.3m, with credit issued falling by 10% and collections performance deteriorating \u2013 impairments increased by almost 4% to 35.7%. Remedial action is being taken but it remains unclear how quickly performance will be improved. Regulation remains the key risk for IPF, with imminent changes in a number of geographies highlighting the ongoing risks. There are legislation changes in Romania, Czech Republic and Mexico which although not as significant as in Poland, put further pressure on the group\u2019s products and operational practices. Gary Greenwood at Shore Capital said: Given the valuation and ongoing concerns around competition and regulation in Eastern Europe as well as the sharp deterioration in performance in Mexico, we downgrade our recommendation to hold (from buy).",

      "bodyText": "Royal Dutch Shell has reported a 71% plunge in quarterly profits in the wake of the global slump in oil prices. The Anglo-Dutch energy giant said net profit fell to $1.18bn (\u00a3890m) in the second quarter, from $3.99bn a year earlier. Shell\u2019s shares dropped nearly 4% in London on the news. Ben van Beurden, the chief executive, said: \u201cLower oil prices continue to be a significant challenge across the business.\u201d Shell has been cutting costs and selling assets, and said it was \u201cfirmly on track\u201d to deliver $40bn in savings by the end of the year. Other energy companies, including BP, have also been slashing tens of thousands of jobs and scaling back investment to cope with the oil slump. Brent crude hit a 12-year low of $27.10 a barrel in January, and on Thursday was trading around $43.50. Two years ago, it was at $115 a barrel. Earlier this week, BP posted a 44% drop in second-quarter profits to $720m. It assumes oil prices will range from $50 to $55 a barrel next year. Shell has taken over rival BG Group to strengthen its position in the liquefied natural gas market.

Overall the FTSE 100 is down 6.07 points at 6744.36, with the biggest influence being Royal Dutch Shell which has knocked 23 points off the index. Shell B shares are down 85p at \u00a320.20 and its A shares 68p lower at 1975.5p as the oil company said net profit fell 70% to $1bn, well below expectations of $2.2bn. Lloyds Banking Group has lost 1.9p to 53.85p as it increased cost cutting with the loss of 3,000 more jobs. SSE is down 66p at \u00a315.60 as the energy company\u2019s shares went ex-dividend. Amid a host of company results Rolls-Royce pleased the market, up 12% at 818.5p, as did Sky, 61p better at 948.5p. Thomas Cook has climbed 5.05p to 65.05p as its third quarter earnings were in line with expectations, despite falling 93% to \u00a32m. The company also cut its full year expectations from \u00a3310m-\u00a3335m to \u00a3300m but this is in line with analyst forecasts, and investors were comforted by the company saying it would still pay a full year dividend. The travel group has been hit by the falling pound in the wake of the Brexit vote, terrorist attacks in Europe and the failed coup in Turkey. After the Fed meeting overnight which left rates on hold but suggested economic conditions were improving, the Bank of Japan unveils its latest decision later. Joshua Mahony, market analyst at IG, said: Markets have seen a relatively choppy start today\u2019s trading, as traders attempt to simultaneously straddle the effects of yesterday\u2019s [Federal Reserve] meeting while also preparing for tonight\u2019s Bank of Japan meeting. Given the uncertainty and wealth of central bank influence, it is likely that today\u2019s trading will be characterised by substantial volatility and choppiness. Yesterday saw the [Fed] stand still once more, with the decision over whether to raise rates now pushed into the September meeting. There is clearly a willingness to act at the Fed, yet each time around another problem rears its head to put the committee off acting. China, stock market weakness, jobs market weakness, disinflation, Brexit, the list goes on. Unfortunately we expect this hunt for a goldilocks scenario to continue and despite talk of two 2016 rate hikes, it is likely we will remain at 0.5% until 2017. The Bank of Japan is the last of the major central banks to decide upon their monetary policy stance in the wake of the EU referendum result. With the Bank of England and ECB both disappointing, tonight\u2019s announcement brings about a significant possibility of a hat-trick of disappointing central bank meetings. This week\u2019s fiscal stimulus announcement [from the Japanese government] will have taken the heat off the Bank of Japan, who have thrown everything but the kitchen sink at the economy, only to find those old foes disinflation and feeble growth come back to haunt them. Given that [Bank of Japan governor Haruhiko] Kuroda has now ruled out so called \u2018helicopter money\u2019 and rates already in negative territory, there is arguably little the Bank can do to that will make a difference now.",

    "webTitle": "British economy begins to show signs of post-Brexit slowdown", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Fears that the British economy has been knocked off course by the Brexit vote have been reinforced by signs of retrenchment across key industries, according to fresh reports. The first health checks of important sectors since Britain voted to leave the European Union overshadowed growth figures, showing a stronger-than-expected performance by the UK in the run-up to the referendum. An expansion of 0.6% in the British economy between April and June was countered by signals from the construction industry, car factories and high street stores that provide the Bank of England with justification for moving to boost growth when its interest rate-setting committee meets next week. The City was braced for action \u2013 from the Bank and the Treasury \u2013 to head off the threat of recession after Thursday\u2019s report. The chancellor, Philip Hammond, made it clear that there would be no repeat of the second quarter GDP growth in the months following Brexit. Hammond said the UK would at least enter divorce negotiations with the EU from a position of strength after the Office for National Statistics said the best quarterly performance by industry since 1999 had pushed up overall economic growth from 0.4% in the first three months of 2016. However, Hammond indicated a slowdown was imminent. \u201cThose negotiations will signal the beginning of a period of adjustment, but I am confident we have the tools to manage the challenges ahead, and along with the Bank of England, this government will take whatever action is necessary to support our economy and maintain business and consumer confidence,\u201d he said. Sterling dropped on the foreign exchanges, despite the growth figures, amid speculation of a package of measures from the Bank\u2019s monetary policy committee on 4 August that might include a cut in the cost of borrowing, a resumption of the quantitative easing money creation programme and incentives to boost lending to households and businesses. The Bank has been weighing up what little evidence there has been of the state of the economy in the five weeks since the referendum. In the latest batch of surveys released on Thursday, the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders said its members were gloomy about the prospects for growth, jobs and investment; the British Retail Consortium said jobs were being shed in the months leading up to the referendum; and RICS \u2013 the body that represents chartered surveyors \u2013 said workloads for construction had weakened. The SMMT gave an upbeat assessment of the industry\u2019s performance in the run-up to the referendum, with almost 900,000 cars rolling off production lines at UK factories in the first six months of the year. This was 13% more than the same period in 2015 and the best half-yearly performance since 2000. Almost 80% of the cars built in UK factories in the first half of 2016 were destined for other countries, with the EU the biggest market. However, the SMMT\u2019s chief executive, Mike Hawes, said the outlook for UK car manufacturing was uncertain now that Britain had opted to pursue a future outside the EU. \u201cThe latest increase in production output is the result of investment decisions made over a number of years, well before the referendum was even a prospect,\u201d he said. Warning that this success was linked to membership of the single market, he said: \u201cThese decisions were based on many factors but primarily on tariff-free access to the single market, economic stability and record levels of productivity from a highly skilled workforce. To ensure the sector\u2019s continued growth, and with it the thousands of jobs it supports, these must be priorities in future negotiations.\u201d The ONS said that construction was the one sector of the economy that was already going backwards in the period leading up to the referendum. The chief economist of the RICS surveyors\u2019 body, Simon Rubinsohn, said the uncertainty caused by Brexit had led to investment being delayed and concerns being raised about the availability of credit. \u201cEncouragingly, the swift actions of the Bank of England in creating additional capacity for the banking sector to provide funding to meet demand should help alleviate some of this pressure,\u201d Rubinsohn said, referring to a \u00a3150bn boost to bank lending announced shortly after the Brexit vote. \u201cNevertheless, anecdotal evidence does indicate that the challenge for the British government in establishing a new relationship with the EU could see some investment plans in the construction sector scaled back.\u201d The BRC reported that the equivalent number of full-time jobs in the industry fell by 2.4% in the second quarter, compared to the same quarter a year ago. The tougher outlook from the BRC followed a separate survey from business lobby group the CBI on Wednesday that found retail sales falling at their fastest rate since early 2012. Evidence culled from retailers in the two weeks immediately after the referendum showed that companies were cutting back on orders from their suppliers at a rate not seen since the economy was deep in recession in 2009. Frances O\u2019Grady, the general secretary of trade union umbrella body the TUC, said: \u201cIt\u2019s good news that growth strengthened in the last quarter before the referendum. The priority now is protecting growth from the fall in business confidence, and the risks to future investment, following the Brexit vote. \u201cThe TUC has published an action plan to keep the economy moving and to make sure working people are not made to pay the price of Brexit. The government must give the go-ahead for a third runway at Heathrow, bring forward major new infrastructure projects like high-speed rail and announce a big expansion in housebuilding.\u201d The Treasury has already announced that it has scrapped plans previously announced by George Osborne to run a budget surplus by the end of the current parliament and Hammond dropped a broad hint that he would cut taxes or increase spending in his autumn statement when he said fiscal policy could be \u201creset\u201d. Economic news since the referendum has been mixed. Business surveys have raised the prospect of the economy going into reverse over the coming months, but the Treasury has been heartened by evidence that industrial production and consumer spending were both robust in the pre-referendum period. Joe Grice, chief economist at the ONS, said the second quarter growth figures indicated little evidence that concern about a possible Brexit vote had a negative impact on the economy before the referendum. \u201cContinued strong growth across services, particularly in retailing, reinforced by healthy growth in the manufacture of cars and pharmaceuticals, boosted output in the second quarter. \u201cAny uncertainties in the run-up to the referendum seem to have had a limited effect. Very few respondents to ONS surveys cited such uncertainties as negatively impacting their businesses,\u201d he said.",

The chancellor, Philip Hammond, made it clear that there would be no repeat of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jul/27/uk-economy-grew-before-brexit-vote-second-quarter-gdp-philip-hammond\">second quarter GDP growth</a> in the months following Brexit.</p> <p>Hammond said the UK would at least enter divorce negotiations with the EU from a position of strength after the Office for National Statistics said the best quarterly performance by industry since 1999 had pushed up overall economic growth from 0.4% in the first three months of 2016.</p> <p>However, Hammond indicated a slowdown was imminent. \u201cThose negotiations will signal the beginning of a period of adjustment, but I am confident we have the tools to manage the challenges ahead, and along with the Bank of England, this government will take whatever action is necessary to support our economy and maintain business and consumer confidence,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Sterling dropped on the foreign exchanges, despite the growth figures, amid speculation of a package of measures from the Bank\u2019s monetary policy committee on 4 August that might include a cut in the cost of borrowing, a resumption of the quantitative easing money creation programme and incentives to boost lending to households and businesses.</p> <p>The Bank has been weighing up what little evidence there has been of the state of the economy in the five weeks since the referendum.</p> <p>In the latest batch of surveys released on Thursday, the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders said its members were gloomy about the prospects for growth, jobs and investment; the British Retail Consortium said jobs were being shed in the months leading up to the referendum; and RICS \u2013 the body that represents chartered surveyors \u2013 said workloads for construction had weakened.</p> <p>The SMMT gave an upbeat assessment of the industry\u2019s performance in the run-up to the referendum, with almost 900,000 cars rolling off production lines at UK factories in the first six months of the year. This was 13% more than the same period in 2015 and the best half-yearly performance since 2000. Almost 80% of the cars built in UK factories in the first half of 2016 were destined for other countries, with the EU the biggest market.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jul/27/uk-economy-grew-before-brexit-vote-second-quarter-gdp-philip-hammond\">UK economy grew by 0.6% before Brexit vote</a> </p> </aside>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ef5b953ce229a2495b44b170acb3484fed6a340d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ef5b953ce229a2495b44b170acb3484fed6a340d/0_0_2871_2167/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Philip Hammond\" width=\"1000\" height=\"755\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Chancellor Philip Hammond has said there is to be no repeat of recent stronger-than-expected growth in the coming months.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dominic Lipinski/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>However, the SMMT\u2019s chief executive, Mike Hawes, said the outlook for UK car manufacturing was uncertain now that Britain had opted to pursue a future outside the EU.</p> <p>\u201cThe latest increase in production output is the result of investment decisions made over a number of years, well before the referendum was even a prospect,\u201d he said. </p> <p>Warning that this success was linked to membership of the single market, he said: \u201cThese decisions were based on many factors but primarily on tariff-free access to the single market, economic stability and record levels of productivity from a highly skilled workforce. To ensure the sector\u2019s continued growth, and with it the thousands of jobs it supports, these must be priorities in future negotiations.\u201d</p> <p>The ONS said that construction was the one sector of the economy that was already going backwards in the period leading up to the referendum. </p> <p>The chief economist of the RICS surveyors\u2019 body, Simon Rubinsohn, said the uncertainty caused by Brexit had led to investment being delayed and concerns being raised about the availability of credit. </p> <p>\u201cEncouragingly, the swift actions of the Bank of England in creating additional capacity for the banking sector to provide funding to meet demand should help alleviate some of this pressure,\u201d Rubinsohn said, referring to a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jul/05/bank-of-england-releases-150bn-pounds-risks-financial-stability\">\u00a3150bn boost to bank lending</a> announced shortly after the Brexit vote. </p> <p>\u201cNevertheless, anecdotal evidence does indicate that the challenge for the British government in establishing a new relationship with the EU could see some investment plans in the construction sector scaled back.\u201d</p> <p>The BRC reported that the equivalent number of full-time jobs in the industry fell by 2.4% in the second quarter, compared to the same quarter a year ago. </p> <p>The tougher outlook from the BRC followed a separate survey from business lobby group the CBI on Wednesday that found retail sales falling at their fastest rate since early 2012. Evidence culled from retailers in the two weeks immediately after the referendum showed that companies were cutting back on orders from their suppliers at a rate not seen since the economy was deep in recession in 2009.</p> <p>Frances O\u2019Grady, the general secretary of trade union umbrella body the TUC, said: \u201cIt\u2019s good news that growth strengthened in the last quarter before the referendum. The priority now is protecting growth from the fall in business confidence, and the risks to future investment, following the Brexit vote.</p> <p>\u201cThe TUC has published an action plan to keep the economy moving and to make sure working people are not made to pay the price of Brexit. The government must give the go-ahead for a third runway at Heathrow, bring forward major new infrastructure projects like high-speed rail and announce a big expansion in housebuilding.\u201d</p> <p>The Treasury has already announced that it has scrapped plans previously announced by George Osborne to run a budget surplus by the end of the current parliament and Hammond dropped a broad hint that he would cut taxes or increase spending in his autumn statement when he said fiscal policy could be \u201creset\u201d.</p> <p>Economic news since the referendum has been mixed. Business surveys have raised the prospect of the economy going into reverse over the coming months, but the Treasury has been heartened by evidence that industrial production and consumer spending were both robust in the pre-referendum period.</p> <p>Joe Grice, chief economist at the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/office-for-national-statistics\">ONS</a>, said the second quarter growth figures indicated little evidence that concern about a possible Brexit vote had a negative impact on the economy before the referendum.</p> <p>\u201cContinued strong growth across services, particularly in retailing, reinforced by healthy growth in the manufacture of cars and pharmaceuticals, boosted output in the second quarter.</p> <p>\u201cAny uncertainties in the run-up to the referendum seem to have had a limited effect. Very few respondents to ONS surveys cited such uncertainties as negatively impacting their businesses,\u201d he said.</p>",
