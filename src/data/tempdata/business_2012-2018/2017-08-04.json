      "bodyText": "As the latest car figures show that uncertainty over Brexit is helping to drag down sales, motor manufacturers fear the industry\u2019s revival over the past couple of decades could be put at risk by Britain\u2019s departure from the European Union. Mike Hawes, chief executive of the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT), said: \u201cA lot of people have spent the best part of decades turning round the industry, when you think back to how it was characterised in the 70s, 80s and into the 90s. It is very different now. It has had very difficult times and it is a cyclical industry, and there is a fear that that success could be put at jeopardy.\u201d He said investments could be curtailed and the industry \u2013 which was overwhelmingly in favour of remaining \u2013 was also facing a multi-million pound bill for planning for the consequences of Brexit. Before the referendum a survey of the SMMT\u2019s 700 members, which include manufacturers such as Jaguar Land Rover, Nissan and Toyota as well as small and medium sized supply chain companies, found that 80% wanted Britain to stay in the EU, with only 10% backing leave. Hawes said the vote was \u201ca shock to everybody,\u201d and now \u201cpeople have gone beyond bewilderment\u201d to try and work out what the potential impact will be. \u201cThere is significant cost because every company has to do a certain level of modelling and planning for risk,\u201d he said, warning that smaller companies did not always have the resources to do this work. While impossible to quantify precisely, Hawes said the cost must be multi-millions of pounds already, including for consultants advising on Brexit implications. This work is almost entirely negative, he said, because it involves looking at future possibilities all considered worse than the frictionless relationship the industry currently has with the EU. And even though the effects of Brexit might not be immediate, that did not mean they could be shrugged off. \u201cWe always said there will not be an immediate closure of plants because the investments are fixed for many companies,\u201d Hawes said. \u201cThe impact is always going to be more gradual, and you are seeing that now: prices going up, demand is softening, investment decisions are on hold.\u201d New investment in the UK was also at risk, he said, due to overseas companies facing questions about whether Britain will have new tariffs and bureaucratic customs barriers, and the \u201cintangible\u201d factor of whether they would feel welcome: \u201cIf you weren\u2019t currently producing in the EU and you were looking to expand your presence into the EU, you probably wouldn\u2019t come to the UK first and foremost.\u201d Since the decline of British-owned car companies in the 1980s, the UK automotive industry has been rebuilt by overseas manufacturers investing in operations based on frictionless integration of products and people with other European countries, and no tariffs or regulatory barriers. SMMT\u2019s most recent figures state that 814,000 people are employed in the UK industry, which in 2015 turned over \u00a372bn and exported \u00a334bn worth of products, with 56% of car exports and 65% of components going to EU countries. Recently the SMMT announced that investment in the first six months of this year had reduced to just \u00a3322m, from a total of \u00a31.66bn invested last year and \u00a32.5bn in 2015. Hawes said that while the huge investments made by major manufacturers make it unlikely they will leave, there was a risk of smaller suppliers, which are more \u201cfleet of foot,\u201d leaving the UK. \u201cIt would just be utterly demoralising to lose so many of those advantages and the progress we have made, and that is the general feeling in the industry,\u201d he said. \u201cWe will rise to the challenge but ideally we want to have as many of the benefits as we currently enjoy because that has helped make the industry successful.\u201d Hawes said the debate about Britain\u2019s relationship with the EU and discussion since the referendum betrayed ignorance among politicians, citing the use of the phrase \u201caccess to the single market,\u201d which he said meant being outside it, facing customs and regulatory barriers. \u201cThere was a lot of language bandied around, and in the prime minister\u2019s speech to the party conference [in October] she said we want business to \u2018trade with and [operate] within the single market\u2019 \u2013 how you are going to square that circle I don\u2019t know.\u201d Hawes said he does not believe people have understood that Britain\u2019s free trade deals with 57 other countries through the EU\u2019s current agreements will also fall away after Brexit. And he found particularly frustrating the \u201cmisguided\u201d view expressed by some prominent leave campaigners that the German car industry would press chancellor Angela Merkel to give the UK a good EU deal, because they export in significant numbers to Britain. \u201cWe consistently said do not expect that. The European market and to a certain extent the European project is more important to them than the UK, so they want to safeguard the four freedoms which benefit them. If any sector has really benefitted from growth and development across Europe, it\u2019s the German car industry. It is frustrating and it also reveals a lack of understanding of the way markets operate.\u201d Asked if Boris Johnson or Nigel Farage, who both made that argument during the referendum campaign, had discussed it with the car industry first, Hawes said they had not. The government\u2019s engagement with business has changed \u201ca little\u201d since the election, he said, and \u201cthe arguments are landing better.\u201d The SMMT called last month for Britain to be kept in the single market and customs union until any new trade agreement with the EU is actually implemented, but he said the industry view is still that any new arrangement will be worse than being in the EU. \u201cFrom our point of view we would be better off to stay. If the electorate decide they maybe didn\u2019t understand the economic arguments or didn\u2019t appreciate how severe the impact was going to be and we need to revisit this, then we will make clear again what the situation is.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Ten years ago, Royal Bank of Scotland was battling with Barclays to take over a Dutch rival, ABN Amro. RBS eventually slapped \u00a349bn on the table and won. It was to be a transformational deal, and it certainly was \u2013 but not in any way that the boss of RBS at the time, Sir Fred Goodwin, had ever planned. Today, the Edinburgh-based bank is still displaying the damage caused by doing that deal. Still 71% owned by the taxpayer after a bailout in October 2008, the bank will once again sink to a big loss by the end of the year \u2013 its 10th consecutive year in the red. The story of RBS shows that, even now, the global financial crisis is having a profound impact. But it also raises another issue: has enough been done to prevent a repeat of the horrors of a decade ago, which began in August 2007? Given concern that the record low interest rates and electronic money printing that central banks resorted to in the face of the biggest recession since the 1930s are storing up problems for the future, the question is simple: has anything really changed? Those responsible for dealing with the crisis say there is little doubt about its lingering impact. Alistair Darling, who had been chancellor for little more than a month when the markets froze in early August 2007, said the events generated a sense of injustice that is still shaping politics today. \u201cVery few people would have thought, back in 2007, this will provoke an economic crisis that will still be under way 10 years later. Everything that\u2019s happening in the world just now \u2013 UK included \u2013 has to be seen in light of the backwash of what happened with the economic crash that followed the banking crash,\u201d said Lord Darling. Events moved swiftly 10 years ago. A month after the banks stopped lending to each other there was a run on Northern Rock \u2013 the first to affect a UK high street bank since Overend Gurney in the 1860s. A year later, Lehman Brothers collapsed in the US \u2013 triggering shockwaves through global markets. In the UK, the government bailed out RBS and Lloyds Banking Group. No longer an MP but now a Labour peer, Darling reckons it could happen again \u2013 but not for a long time. \u201cWhen the present generation is gone, the people who were in shock, a bright spark will come along and say \u2018I\u2019ve found a great way of making money\u2019 and there\u2019ll be nobody to say \u2018the last time we did that we went bust\u2019.\u201d Mervyn King, with whom Darling had a sometimes testy relationship during the crisis, agrees. Like most of those in the eye of the storm a decade ago, King thinks the financial system is in much better shape, but would be even healthier had Darling fully nationalised RBS and forced all the leading banks to take bailout cash, as happened in the US. Even so, he said, banks were stronger and individuals now had to take greater personal responsibility for their actions. \u201cIn that sense we are in a much better position, but the challenge for policymakers is not to worry about today but to worry about what happens in 20 years\u2019 time, when everyone will have forgotten about this,\u201d said Lord King. \u201cThat\u2019s what a central bank is all about, it\u2019s an organisation with institutional memory.\u201d His idea is for central banks to become a \u201cpawnbroker for all seasons\u201d \u2013 agreeing in advance the terms of any loans by a lender of last resort, helping to avoid the moral hazard problem where banks take risks because they know they are going to be bailed out. A senior Bank of England official, Alex Brazier, has recently warned about banks dicing with a \u201cspiral of complacency\u201d in their consumer lending \u2013 when borrowing on credit cards, via unsecured loans and car loan schemes has topped the \u00a3200bn level for the first time since the crisis. Paul Myners, a former fund manger who was City minister during the banking crisis, is concerned. \u201cEven a return to normal interest rates of inflation plus one or two per cent would have quite substantial impacts on a lot of borrowers ... You start to run scenarios in which interest rates are higher and the economy is not going so well and the default risk in property, consumer credit and car loans will increase dramatically,\u201d said Lord Myners. He does not, however, think we are on the verge of another collapse. But he does believe there should be more scrutiny of shadow banking \u2013 where fund managers, insurance companies and hedge funds conduct bank-like activities with less regulation. Adair Turner, who became chairman of the Financial Services Authority in the month that Lehman Brothers went bust, worries that the complex, off-balance-sheet financial instruments that dominated the 2007 crisis \u2013 such as special investment vehicles (SIV) \u2013 have now become a feature of the financial regime in China, the world\u2019s second biggest economy. Lord Turner reckons the authorities in Beijing could contain a financial crisis \u2013 but the inevitable slowdown in the Chinese economy that would follow would prove costly to the rest of the world. But he also believes that after 10 years of record stimulus \u2013 low interest rates and electronic money printing through quantitative easing \u2013 the world may be ill equipped to cope with another recession. \u201cThe big thing sitting behind the global economy is even, after years and years of very low and even negative interest rates, all we are getting to is barely adequate growth rates and inflation still below target. So if in that environment you have a significant downward shock, what do the central banks do next?\u201d After the crisis, the FSA was shut down in a regulatory overhaul . The Bank of England was handed back powers to oversee the biggest lenders and a new regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), was set up to monitor how financial firms behaved. There was a big push to force all the strategically important global banks to increase the amount of capital they held against possible losses. Turner, who chaired the now defunct FSA until 2013, said: \u201cI think the financial system is now much more resilient than what it was in 2007-08.\u201d Andrew Bailey, who now runs the FCA, was at the Bank of England during the crisis. He also cites the side-effects of a prolonged period of low interest rates. On Thursday, the Bank of England left interest rates unchanged at 0.25%. \u201cIf we put Brexit to one side, then the impact of sustained low and negative real interest rates is the biggest issue we face,\u201d said Bailey, pointing to research by the Institute for Fiscal Studies showing the gap between young people and the older generation. Darling points to the social and political impact of the years following the crisis. \u201cIf you look at the politics that have seen Trump elected, the politics in the UK today, of Brexit, a lot of it has got to do with the backwash of that time, where people have seen their incomes squeezed, if not reduced. People are worried about the security of employment.\u201d The consequence of the credit crunch and the global financial crisis, he concludes, is \u201c a millennial generation who are now poorer than the generation which came before them\u201d.",

In the UK, the government bailed out RBS and Lloyds Banking Group.<br></p> <p> No longer an MP but now a Labour peer, Darling reckons it could happen again \u2013 but not for a long time.<strong> </strong>\u201cWhen the present generation is gone, the people who were in shock, a bright spark will come along and say \u2018I\u2019ve found a great way of making money\u2019 and there\u2019ll be nobody to say \u2018the last time we did that we went bust\u2019.\u201d</p> <p>Mervyn King, with whom Darling had a sometimes testy relationship during the crisis, agrees. Like most of those in the eye of the storm a decade ago, King thinks the financial system is in much better shape, but would be even healthier had Darling fully nationalised RBS and forced all the leading banks to take bailout cash, as happened in the US.</p> <p>Even so, he said, banks were stronger and individuals now had to take greater personal responsibility for their actions.</p> <p>\u201cIn that sense we are in a much better position, but the challenge for policymakers is not to worry about today but to worry about what happens in 20 years\u2019 time, when everyone will have forgotten about this,\u201d said Lord King. \u201cThat\u2019s what a central bank is all about, it\u2019s an organisation with institutional memory.\u201d </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"af17d20549c05460df9afbe075bf79237bf4bc25\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/af17d20549c05460df9afbe075bf79237bf4bc25/0_300_5760_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Alex Brazier at the Bank of England\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Alex Brazier at the Bank of England.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Levene for the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>His idea is for central banks to become a \u201cpawnbroker for all seasons\u201d \u2013 agreeing in advance the terms of any loans by a lender of last resort, helping to avoid the moral hazard problem where banks take risks because they know they are going to be bailed out. </p> <p>A senior Bank of England official, Alex Brazier, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/jul/24/bank-of-england-household-debt-bank-credit-card-car-loan\">has recently warned about banks dicing with a \u201cspiral of complacency\u201d </a>in their consumer lending \u2013 when borrowing on credit cards, via unsecured loans and car loan schemes <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/jul/31/fca-unauthorised-overdrafts-car-loan-market\">has topped the \u00a3200bn level for the first time since the crisis</a>.</p> <p></p> <p>Paul Myners, a former fund manger who was City minister during the banking crisis, is concerned. </p> <p>\u201cEven a return to normal interest rates of inflation plus one or two per cent would have quite substantial impacts on a lot of borrowers ... You start to run scenarios in which interest rates are higher and the economy is not going so well and the default risk in property, consumer credit and car loans will increase dramatically,\u201d said Lord Myners.

The Bank of England was handed back powers to oversee the biggest lenders and a new regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), was set up to monitor how financial firms behaved.

    "webTitle": "Dow hits record high after US jobs report beats forecasts - as it happened", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Time for a quick recap: America\u2019s economy has beaten expectations by creating 209,000 new jobs in July. An upbeat Non-Farm Payroll report also showed the jobless rate has fallen to 4.3%, while annual wage growth remained at 2.5%. The labor force participation rate picked up too. Here are the details Economists broadly welcomed the news. As Michael Pearce of Capital Economics put it: The real economy remains on a strong growth path at the start of the third quarter. If the labour market continues to tighten over the coming months, as the survey evidence suggests it will, the Fed will raise rates again later this year. Many of the new jobs were low-paid, though, while manufacturing continued to shrink as a share of the economy. Wall Street cheered the NFP report, sending the Dow Jones industrial average to a new all-time high. Marcus Bullus, trading director of MB Capital, says: \u201cAfter seven straight record closes, the Dow\u2019s reaction to Friday\u2019s solid US jobs data has been balanced rather than breathless \u2013 with much of the cheerleading left to President Trump. \u201cBut nevertheless there\u2019s much to be reassured by in this comprehensively strong jobs print. \u201cYes the headline figures are impressive, both on the job creation and unemployment rate fronts. \u201cBut the details are arguably more important \u2013 the participation rate is creeping up as more Americans return to work, and average wages continue their solid upward progress. \u201cWith more Americans working, and more Americans earning more, the US\u2019s consumer-led growth remains firmly on track \u2013 powering equities into a sustained bull run. The dollar is also staging a recovery. It has now surged by 1% against the euro after hitting its lowest level since January 2015 this morning. Donald Trump welcomed the figures on Twitter (where else?....). And that\u2019s all for today. Thanks for reading and commenting. GW The dollar is continuing to rebound strongly, putting worries about the Russian probe to one side. The greenback has hit a one-week high against the Japanese yen, at \u00a5110.99. It\u2019s also at a four-day high against the euro: Jameel Ahmad, VP of Corporate Research at FXTM, says today\u2019s jobs report has lifted the dollar. Those hoping that the US dollar would be thrown a lifeline may be in luck, following the news that the United States added another 209,000 jobs to its economy in July This is an overall positive employment report and highlights the underlying strength of the US labor market. Figures exceeded expectations, with earlier projections sitting at 183,000 and wage growth, with average earnings rising by an annualised 2.5%, being further good news for the US Dollar. Boom! The Dow Jones industrial average has hit a fresh record high in New York. Wall Street traders piled into stocks as soon as the opening bell rang, following today\u2019s jobs report. This pushed the Dow up by 62 points, or 0.28%, to 22,088 points. Investors are encouraged by the news that America\u2019s economy created 209,000 new jobs last month, or almost 30,000 more than expected. The pick-up in monthly wage growth, from 0.2% to 0.3%, has also cheered the markets. Employment site site Indeed.com have sent over a handy chart, showing how many of these new jobs were relatively poorly paid... ....and another one showing how the US factory sector continued to shrink. Indeed Chief Economist Jed Kolko says: \u201cThis was a banner jobs report. With the strong payroll number in July, job growth in the past three months is ahead of the 2016 pace and way ahead of what\u2019s needed to keep up with population growth. Working-age adults are now more likely to be employed than at any time since the recession.\u201d \u201cAlthough wage growth remains stuck at 2.5%, the changing industry mix might be holding wage growth back. Low-wage industries grew fastest in July, led by leisure and hospitality. That\u2019s helping the least-educated Americans get back to work. The recovery is now strong and long enough to lift many of the people hurt most by the recession -- except in manufacturing, which continues to lag overall jobs growth.\u201d Donald Trump\u2019s upbeat tweet failed to mention that the US labor market has been creating jobs steadily for years. Today\u2019s employment report is pretty robust, but it also extends a long trend of job creation and moderate wage growth. Ranko Berich of Monex Europe has tweeted this chart, showing monthly NFP figures (in blue) and the rolling average (in green). Berich adds that the dollar will probably remain under pressure, despite its rally in the last 50 minutes... \u201dThe move is not yet anywhere near large enough to suggest the greenback\u2019s relentless downwards trend of the last few weeks has been challenged.\u201d Erik Norland, Senior Economist at CME Group, has calculated that total pay growth remained steady in July. He writes: \u201cNon-farm payrolls grew by 209,000 in July, 29,000 better than consensus, while average hours earnings advanced by 2.5%, beating consensus by 0.1%. These numbers are very strong. Meanwhile unemployment fell back to its 17 year low of 4.3%. \u201cWhat this means is that total labour income in the US grew by 4.3%, very much consistent with its pace of growth since 2010. Here\u2019s our US business editor, Dominic Rushe, on today\u2019s US jobs report: The US economy added 209,000 new jobs in July \u2013 the second month in a row of 200,000 plus jobs growth. The unemployment rate fell to 4.3%, a 16-year low. Economists had forecast the US would add 180,000 jobs in July, in line with the average monthly gain for the last six months. The latest jobs news will come as a welcome relief for Donald Trump, who was elected on the promise of rebuilding the US jobs market. \u201cExcellent Jobs Numbers just released,\u201d the president tweeted, \u201cand I have only just begun. Many job stifling regulations continue to fall. Movement back to USA!\u201d Ahead of the latest figures from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the president heralded the announcement that Toyota and Mazda would soon be adding 4,000 new jobs at two new US plants. However, the jobs report showed once again that the majority of gains were in low-paying service industries. Jobs in food services and drinking places rose by 53,000 in July. The industry has added 313,000 jobs over the year. Healthcare employment increased by 39,000. Job growth in higher-paid sectors including construction, manufacturing and mining was marginal. Here\u2019s Dom\u2019s full story: President Donald Trump didn\u2019t waste any time in welcoming today\u2019s jobs figures, and taking credit for them too.... America\u2019s record-breaking run of job creation continued in July, points out economist Rupert Seggins: Alan Krueger, who chaired President Obama\u2019s council of economic advisors, says the NFP report doesn\u2019t contain any nasty surprises. Speaking on Bloomberg TV, he says: That\u2019s solid for the economy. It says the recovery is continuing at the same pace as before. Here\u2019s more details from the jobs report: Private sector jobs: Up by 205,000, compared with 194,000 in June Government jobs: Up by 4,000, compared with 37,000 in June Factory jobs: Up by 16,000, compared with 12,000 in June Goods-producing jobs: Up by 22,000 Construction jobs: Up by 6,000 Retail: Up by 900 Kully Samra, UK managing director at investment group Charles Schwab, says July\u2019s jobs report confirms the strength of the US economy. And that means the US central bank is likely to raise interest rates again before Christmas, Samra says. Sustained labour market strength will likely mean that the Federal Reserve remains on track to raise interest rates for a third time this year and announce a plan to start its balance sheet reduction plan, despite a recent ebb in inflation pressures. This healthy set of figures should bolster labour market buoyancy and goes some way to suggest that there is momentum in the economy to generate some inflation, even though price pressures still remain moderate. With US stocks drifting along near record highs, this latest jobs report bolsters our view that the US economy remains in robust shape as we continue in this long-term bull market.\u201d In another encouraging sign, America\u2019s labor force participation rate has risen to 62.9%, from 62.8%. That suggests that people are returning to the jobs market. On an annual basis, US earnings grew by 2.5% in July. That matches June\u2019s figures, and is a \u201cpretty solid\u201d result, according to James Pethokoukis of the American Enterprise Institute: The dollar is rallying back from this morning\u2019s lows, as traders welcome today\u2019s No-Farm Payroll report. This has sent the euro down 0.25% to $1.184, and the pound down to $1.311. Average earnings in the US economy grew by 0.3% in July, today\u2019s report shows, up from 0.2% in June. That\u2019s another encouraging sign, although workers might hope for stronger wage growth at this stage of the economic cycle. Breaking! America\u2019s economy created 209,000 new jobs last month. That\u2019s better than most economists had expected, and suggests the US labor market is still recovering. June\u2019s non-farm payroll has been revised higher too - to 231,000 jobs, from 222,00 originally. Plus....the unemployment rate has dropped to 4.3%, from 4.4%. More to follow... Tension is mounting in the markets ahead of the Non-Farm Payroll report. The US dollar is hovering at $1.1870 against the euro, close to this week\u2019s two and a half-year low. Forecasts for today\u2019s Non-Farm Payroll range from a modest 175,000 extra jobs to a robust 220,000. It\u2019s nearly time for the final major economic news of the week - America\u2019s Non-Farm Payroll for July. The NFP will tell us how many new jobs were created in the US last month (excluding hirings in the volatile agriculture sector), how much workers got paid, and whether people entered or left the labour market. Payroll forecasts vary widely, as it\u2019s quite a volatile measure (which is why financial types play a game of trying to guess the number each month, with limited success). Here\u2019s the consensus expectations for the data, due at 8.30am East Coast time or 1.30pm in London. NFP: Up by 183,000, compared with 222,000 in June Unemployment rate: Down to 4.3%, from 4.4% in June Average earnings (monthly): +0.3%, up from 0.2% in June. Although the job creation number may dominate the headlines, investors may be more interested in the wage growth figures. Earnings, and inflation, will determine how fast the US Federal Reserve can raise interest rates over the coming months. Kathleen Brooks of spreadbetting firm City Index explains: We believe that the wage component, which we do not forecast, will be the most important piece of data from the labour market report on Friday. If wages only rise by the expected 0.3% on the month, the annual rate is expected to weaken a touch to 2.4% from 2.5%, then it is hard to see how the dollar could stage a meaningful rally, as weak wage growth is likely to hinder the chances of a further rate hike from the Federal Reserve later this year. The US dollar\u2019s weakness, and general nervousness, is keeping the gold price near a seven-week high today. Bullion is changing hands at $1,268 per ounce, up slightly today, and close to the highest level since mid June. That means gold is on track to gain 1% this week, adding to the 2.2% increase in July. Warren Patterson, analyst at ING, says: (via Reuters): \u201cIts the same trend we\u2019ve seen for the last month. There\u2019s no change. Its mainly a dollar story.\u201d Connor Campbell of City firm SpreadEx predicts more pain for the dollar today, if July\u2019s jobs figures are a disappointment. He writes: Analysts are expecting the headline non-farm figure to shrink from 222k [new jobs] to 182k month-on-month, but with the unemployment rate falling back to 4.3%. Wage growth, meanwhile, is set to remain rather flaccid, with forecasts of a 0.3% increase in July compared to the 0.2% jump in June. If accurate \u2013 and remember, those non-farm estimates have a tendency to be way off base \u2013 it could be another difficult day for the dollar, continuing the currency\u2019s summer from hell. Plus, of course, we could see more revelations around the Russia inquiry. Any suggestion that the situation is becoming more serious for the White House would probably spook the markets. The US dollar is on track for its fourth weekly loss in a row, unless today\u2019s jobs data is strong enough to spark a rally. Bloomberg says: The dollar index is headed for a fourth straight weekly decline after yesterday\u2019s report that Special Counsel Robert Mueller is using a federal grand jury in Washington to help his probe into Russia\u2019s alleged interference in the 2016 U.S. election and possible collusion. Investors shouldn\u2019t panic over the news that the UK government is reviewing Help to Buy, says Anthony Codling of Jeffries. Codling reckons the scheme will simply be tweaked, to encourage more smaller homes to be built, rather than sunk altogether. There is speculation in Property Week that the UK Government is seeking to scale back Help to Buy. Our view is that the Government will do nothing which could lead to a reduction in housebuilding volumes. We believe that around two thirds of Help to Buy sales did not need help to buy, rather homebuyers used the scheme to purchase a bigger home. Focusing Help to Buy on First Time Buyers who need it is sensible, in our view. Housebuilders may need to build more 3 bed homes and fewer 5 bed ones, but, in our view, such a change in density may lead to a rise rather than a fall in housebuilder returns. There\u2019s a subdued mood in Europe\u2019s stock markets this morning, with the main indices broadly flat. Investors seem to be keeping to the sidelines until the US jobs report has landed. Joshua Mahony, market analyst at IG, says: The exuberance of yesterday appears to have been left behind this morning, with the FTSE retreating into a risk-conscious period of consolidation, given the unpredictability ahead of us. UK housebuilders are having a particularly bad, following a report that the government could end its \u2018Help To Buy\u2019 scheme early. Persimmon, Taylor Wimpey and Barratt Development are all down 3.5%, even though the government has denied that the scheme - which helps first-time buyers - is being wrapped up. The US dollar continues to bob around a 15-month low, as traders get ready for the US jobs report in three hours time. Concerns over the US political situation continues to weigh on the dollar. Commerzbank strategists explained to clients this morning that: \u201cIt is becoming increasingly clear that the greenback is ...suffering as a result of President Trump\u2019s weak government --the situation in the White House is simply too chaotic. \u201cThat means any hopes that arose after the elections andresulted in a sharp rise in inflation expectations have sincebeen dashed.\u201d The drop in car sales last month shows that consumers are struggling, says Howard Archer, chief economist at the EY Item Club: Sky News\u2019s economics editor Ed Conway is also concerned: Noble Francis, economics director of the Construction Products Association, fears that the slowdown in car sales could signal a wider weakness in the economy: Breaking! UK car sales fell over 9% in July, for the fourth month in a row. The Society for Motor Manufacturers and Traders blamed Brexit uncertainty for the decline, and is urging the government to provide clarity over its plans. According to the SMMT, 161,997 new cars were registered in the month as the market continues to fall. Car sales to businesses slumped by 23.8% year on year, while fleet sales were down 10% and registrations to private buyers fell by 6.8%. Mike Hawes, SMMT chief executive, says the auto industry desperately needs to know what Brexit deal Britain is aiming for: The fall in consumer and business confidence is having a knock on effect on demand in the new car market and government must act quickly to provide concrete plans regarding Brexit. Diesel sales declined by 20%, following the recent emission scandal, while sales of alternatively fuelled vehicles, such as electric cars, surged by almost 65%. Hawes explains: While it\u2019s encouraging to see record achievements for alternatively fuelled vehicles, consumers considering other fuel types will have undoubtedly been affected by the uncertainty surrounding the government\u2019s clean air plans. Today\u2019s dollar weakness is part of a broader trend. The greenback has lost around 10% of its value since January, as optimism that Donald Trump might achieve tax reforms and infrastructure spending have faded. This chart, from CNN, shows how the US currency has had a rocky ride as investors lost faith, or patience, with the president. CNN says: The \u201cWhite House soap opera\u201d has fueled the dollar\u2019s decline, according to Kit Juckes, a macro strategist at Societe Generale. \u201cConfidence in the U.S. administration\u2019s ability to deliver growth-boosting fiscal policies is at rock bottom,\u201d Juckes wrote in a report this week. More here: The UK economy is \u201ca little bit\u201d better placed to withstand a small rise in interest rates according to Ben Broadbent, the deputy governor of the Bank of England. Broadbent has been speaking a day after the Bank\u2019s Monetary Policy Committee left rates on hold at an all-time low of 0.25% and downgraded UK growth forecasts. He told BBC Radio 5 Live: \u201cWe have got to recognise that changes in interest rates take time. We can\u2019t look just at what is happening now, we have to look at what might happen in the medium term. \u201cWe think that the economy will continue to grow, we think that wage growth will pick up. I think there may be some possibility for interest rates to go up a little bit.\u201d Broadbent suggested there was light at the end of the tunnel for cash-strapped consumers, whose incomes are being squeezed as prices rise faster than wages: \u201cWe think inflation will peak in the second half of this year. We expect... wage growth over the next three years.\u201d It\u2019s a dark morning for staff at educational publisher Pearson, as it announces plans to cut another 3,000 jobs.... Back in the UK, Royal Bank of Scotland has revealed it is planning to create a new hub in Amsterdam, to help it cope with Brexit. Shares in the taxpayer-owned bank have jumped by over 4% this morning, after it also announced it made a profit of almost \u00a31bn in the last six month. Maybe the worst of over for RBS (although a likely fine from US regulators over its conduct before the financial crisis still looms...) The US dollar could weaken further today, if July\u2019s American employment report fails to meet expectations. FXTM Research Analyst Lukman Otunuga believes it will take something special to shake off the grand jury news. It has been another rough and rocky trading week for the Greenback as heightened political jitters in Washington weighed heavily on the currency.... The distressed Dollar is in need of a lifeline and it may take an extreme upside surprise in both headline job numbers and earnings to bring the bulls back into the game. The US dollar is under pressure this morning, after it emerged that a grand jury has been convened to examine that Russia meddled in the US presidential election. The dollar is languishing at a 15-month low this morning, and is close to its lowest level against the euro in over two years. Reuters reports: The dollar hovered near the 2-1/2-year-low against the euro touched earlier this week, pressured by signs that probes into possible Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. elections are gathering pace. Mike Van Dulken of Accendo Markets says there is \u201cunrelenting US dollar weakness\u201d right now. And Sireen Harajli, FX strategist at Mizuho in New York, says: \u201c(Political) policy uncertainty in the U.S. I think has been the biggest driver of declines in the dollar recently. \u201cAny positive effect from the election of President Trump I think at this point has been priced out. This comes after US media reported that special prosecutor Robert Mueller had set up the grand jury, as part of his inquiry into whether the Trump campaign colluded with the Kremlin. President Trump hit back last night, telling his supporters that there was a plot to \u201ccheat\u201d them out of his leadership.... Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial market, the eurozone and business. America\u2019s economy is in the spotlight today as we find out how many new jobs were created in the US last month. July\u2019s Non-Farm Payroll is expected to show that the US unemployment rate dipped back to 4.3% last month, with around 183,000 new jobs created. The earnings figures will be closely watched too. They may show that wages rose by 0.3% during the month, up from June\u2019s disappointing 0.2%. Although the Non-Farm Payroll is frequently revised, it is a good insight into the health of the world\u2019s largest economy. President Donald Trump famously promised to be \u201cthe greatest jobs president that God ever created.\u201d This might not be the first thing the history books remember him for, but today\u2019s figures could show if he\u2019s delivering on that pledge. Eric Lascelles, chief economist at RBC Global Asset Management, expects a strong report: \u201cOur models point to an above-consensus gain of 200,000 or better in July. This aligns well with the quick job creation in June and other measures of labour market health that abound in the U.S. However, we are aware that there is a slight undercurrent of decelerating job creation over the past few years that will probably extend on a trend basis into the future \u2013 a natural function of an aging cycle.\u201d The US economy created jobs steadily under president Obama\u2019s watch, as this chart reminds us: In the City, Royal Bank of Scotland, publishing group Pearson and theme park operator Merlin Entertainment are all reporting results.

      "bodyText": "The US economy added 209,000 new jobs in July \u2013 the second month in a row of 200,000-plus jobs growth. The unemployment rate fell to 4.3%, a 16-year low. Economists had forecast the US would add 180,000 jobs in July, in line with the average monthly gain for the last six months. The latest jobs news will come as a welcome relief for Donald Trump, who was elected on the promise of rebuilding the US jobs market. \u201cExcellent Jobs Numbers just released,\u201d the president tweeted, \u201cand I have only just begun. Many job stifling regulations continue to fall. Movement back to USA!\u201d Ahead of the latest figures from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the president heralded the announcement that Toyota and Mazda would soon be adding 4,000 new jobs at two new US plants. June\u2019s job gains were revised up from 222,000 to 231,000. However, the jobs report showed once again that the majority of gains were in low-paying service industries. Jobs in food services and drinking establishments rose by 53,000 in July. The industry has added 313,000 jobs over the year. Healthcare employment increased by 39,000. Job growth in higher-paid sectors including construction, manufacturing and mining was marginal. Wage growth has remained lackluster since the recovery from the last recession and was a mediocre 2.5% higher in July this year compared to July 2016. \u201cOverall, this morning\u2019s report shows the recovery continues, but with wage growth below target levels, it is abundantly clear that we have a ways to go before we reach genuine full employment \u2013 where workers including young and old, and workers of all races can fully benefit from the economy,\u201d wrote Economics Policy Institute senior economist Elise Gould. On Wednesday, the payroll processor ADP said US businesses had added 178,000 in July, less than the 190,000 forecast. ADP reported job gains in all sectors except for manufacturing, which lost 4,000 jobs. The biggest gainers were professional and business services, up 65,000, and education and health services, up 43,000. Mark Zandi, chief economist of Moody\u2019s Analytics, which helps compile the ADP report, said: \u201cThe American job machine continues to operate in high gear. \u201cJob gains are broad-based across industries and company sizes, with only manufacturers reducing their payrolls. At this pace of job growth, unemployment will continue to quickly decline.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "New car sales in the UK have fallen for the fourth month running, as Brexit uncertainty weighs on demand and buyers shun diesel cars in greater numbers. Sales fell 9.3% in July to 161,997 new cars as consumers and businesses grew increasingly reluctant to commit to major spending decisions. \u201cThe fall in consumer and business confidence is having a knock-on effect on demand in the new car market and the government must act quickly to provide concrete plans regarding Brexit,\u201d said Mike Hawes, chief executive of the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders, which published the figures. Sales of diesel cars were down by a fifth in July compared with a year earlier, to 69,157. Hawes blamed uncertainty over clean-air plans in the UK, after the government announced proposals to ban all new petrol and diesel cars and vans from 2040 amid fears that rising levels of nitrogen oxide posed a major risk to public health. Sales of new petrol cars were also down in July, falling 3% to 83,969. While diesel and petrol sales fell in July, there was a sharp rise in the sale of new alternatively fuelled vehicles, up 65% compared with the same month last year to 8,871. AFVs accounted for 5.5% of all new car sales in July, which was a record high. The fall in new car sales in recent months has brought to an end to five years of growth \u2013 fuelled by cheap car finance deals \u2013 which has helped to underpin the consumer-led growth in the wider economy. However, household budgets are coming under renewed pressure as prices rise faster than wages, signalling a return to the fall in real pay that hit workers in the aftermath of the financial crisis. The Bank of England said on Thursday that businesses were also less willing to spend money at a time of persistent uncertainty over Britain\u2019s future relationship with the EU. New car sales are now down 2.2% in 2017 so far, to 1.56m. The SMMT is forecasting a 2.6% drop in sales in 2017 overall, following a record 2.6m registrations in 2016. In July, sales fell across the UK, by 13.7% in Scotland, 12.5% in Wales, 9% in England, and 2.3% in Northern Ireland. Alex Buttle, director at car buying comparison website Motorway.co.uk, said the industry could be heading for a sharp downturn. He said: \u201c2017 is starting to feel like the auto industry\u2019s annus horribilis. This could be the beginning of a deep recession for the new car industry, the likes of which we haven\u2019t seen since the credit crunch. \u201cDiesel D-day might be over 20 years away, but we could see new car sales continuing to fall by 10-20% a month in the near term. After all, who is going to want to buy a diesel car now - especially with the prospect of paying a hefty toxin tax in the future and falling resale values?\u201d Hawes said weaker demand for new cars should result in some cheap deals for consumers. \u201cThe lower demand in recent months will inevitably mean competition from manufacturers will intensify and it will be a good opportunity for consumers to get a great deal on their next car.\u201d The National Franchised Dealers Association said the government would need to invest more in electric vehicle infrastructure, such as car charging points, to meet growth in the alternative fuel market.

      "bodyText": "Pearson is to cut 3,000 jobs as the embattled company looks to slash costs after a slump at its US higher education business. The world\u2019s largest education company, which has issued five profit warnings in the past four years, intends to axe about 10% of its 32,000 global workforce by the end of 2019. The latest round of cuts means that the chief executive, John Fallon, will have shed 10,000 staff, about 25% of Pearson\u2019s global workforce, since he took over from Dame Marjorie Scardino in 2013. \u201cNo one takes pleasure in this sort of transformation we have to do but it is fundamental to the long-term future of the company,\u201d Fallon said. \u201cI am looking forward to getting the revenue growth of the company going again.\u201d The cuts, which will save the firm about \u00a3300m annually, will come from across the company with a major focus on its struggling US business, where its higher education unit is struggling with a decline in textbook sales and the transition towards digital learning. \u201cIn North America we need to adjust the cost base to the reality of a smaller higher education courseware business,\u201d said Coram Williams, Pearson\u2019s finance chief. Jobs are expected to go in areas including IT, finance and human resources as well as company management, as the business looks to become leaner and more digitally focused. Fallon recently attended a company sales event at its US business, which accounts for two-thirds of Pearson\u2019s revenues and profits, and he said that the \u201cmood and morale was very strong, buoyant\u201d. \u201cPeople are confident about the year ahead,\u201d he said. \u201cThey understand the challenges in the business over the next two or three years but are also excited by the opportunity. There is plenty of time to plan and prepare.\u201d Since Fallon took the top role in 2013 through to 2020 the company\u2019s cost base will have been reduced by \u00a3950m, including three tranches of job cuts: 3,000 in 2013-14; 4,000 in 2016; and the latest round by the end of 2019. Pearson, which conducts most of its business in the second half of the year, reported first-half revenues up 1% to \u00a32.05bn and reiterated that it would hit its revised targets for 2017. The North American business managed flat growth, with revenue of \u00a31.28bn, better than forecasts. Pearson has factored in a 6% decline at its US higher education business this year and in 2018 before it is expected to recover. It hopes to benefit from a stabilisation in the drop in school enrolments and its digital strategy \u2013 such as increasing focus on cutting e-book prices and textbook rentals \u2013 starting to pay off. The company announced it has added book chain Barnes &amp; Noble to its textbook rental scheme. In February, Pearson reported a pre-tax loss of \u00a32.6bn for 2016, the biggest in its history. In May, Fallon, who has faced calls to step down, encountered a massive shareholder revolt with almost 70% voting against, or failing to support by abstention, his \u00a31.5m pay package. In January, the company slashed its profit forecast for this year by \u00a3180m and scrapped its target of \u00a3800m for next year.",

      "bodyText": "Royal Bank of Scotland is considering using Amsterdam as its post-Brexit EU hub and has revealed it is being investigated for potential breaches of money laundering rules. The the 71% taxpayer-owned bank made the announcements as it reported its first half-year profit for three years. The \u00a3939m profit compares with a \u00a32bn loss a year ago, although the chief executive, Ross McEwan, warned a full-year loss was likely, which would be the 10th consecutive year of annual losses since its 2008 bailout. The bank signalled that more jobs could be cut on top of the 14,200 \u2013 about 15% of the workforce \u2013 which have gone in the last 12 months. These job losses reduced costs which helped boost profits, as did a better performance at its investment banking business, NatWest Market. The Amsterdam office is for the NatWest Markets arm, and advanced discussions are under way with the Dutch national bank. RBS already holds a banking licence in the Netherlands \u2013 a legacy of its takeover of the Dutch bank ABN Amro \u2013 and needs to beef up its presence there to \u201cminimise disruption to the business\u201d after Brexit. The operation could need 150 people, RBS said, although it may not be necessary to move all staff from London. The cost of setting up the hub will be in the \u201ctens of millions\u201d. Meanwhile, the news of the investigation into potential breaches of money laundering rules was contained in the more than 15 pages of legal warnings attached to the results. \u201cOn 21 July 2017, the FCA [Financial Conduct Authority] notified RBS that it is undertaking an investigation into RBS plc\u2019s compliance with the money laundering regulations 2007 in relation to certain customers. RBS is cooperating with the investigation,\u201d the bank said, without providing further details. There was a separate disclosure about a previously announced investigation into allegations that Britain\u2019s banks processed vast amounts of tainted money from Russian criminals. But McEwan said: \u201cOur path to sustainable profitability is becoming clearer and closer and we have resolved some of the most significant issues this bank faced.\u201d He added: \u201cIt does feel this business is seeing the light at the tunnel,\u201d but said the one major outstanding issue was settlement with the US Department of Justice over the sale of toxic mortgage bonds a decade ago. He hopes for a resolution before the end of the year. Sir Howard Davies, the bank\u2019s chairman, is among senior figures in Brexit discussions with the government. Davies said there was now a recognition of the potential for \u201csome quite serious consequences for London which could happen in a very rapid and unplanned way if we don\u2019t get some transition agreements\u201d. He said the bank had just started to detect \u201csigns of hesitancy\u201d among corporate customers, especially manufacturers. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing people sitting on their hands a bit,\u201d he said. On Thursday, the governor of the Bank of England, Mark Carney, said Brexit was starting to affect business decisions. But McEwan said the results demonstrated a reason to own RBS shares, which is important if the chancellor, Philip Hammond, is to be able to sell off any more on top of the 5% stake sold in August 2015 at a \u00a31bn loss. McEwan said the decision to sell was the government\u2019s and Hammond has previously cited the DoJ settlement as an impediment to a sale but also signalled that the shares could be sold at a loss. The Treasury repeated a statement that it would \u201ccontinue to seek opportunities for disposals, but the need to resolve legacy issues makes it uncertain as to when these will occur.\u201d It added: \u201cThere is still work to do but RBS is continuing to implement its strategy and is making good progress in dealing with the problems of the past.\u201d Nicholas Hyett, an equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said that until mistakes of the past were resolved \u201call the good work that RBS has done will continue to get lost in the noise\u201d. \u201cThe core businesses are delivering steady income growth thanks to growing activity and costs look to be falling,\u201d said Hyett. RBS shares closed at 261.2p, up 1.9% but still well below the average price per share of 502p during its bailout in 2008 and 2009.",

Airbus A380 QF7 took off from Kingsford Smith Airport just before 2pm, bound for Dallas Fort Worth in the United States but flight radars detected the plane circling and dumping fuel following a \u201ctechnical issue\u201d. The flaps on the wings were unable to retract, making it difficult for the aircraft to fly efficiently. \u201cAs the Dallas flight is our longest on the network, the captain made the decision to return to Sydney,\u201d Qantas said in a statement. The plane landed at Sydney airport safely on Friday afternoon, after dumping fuel off the coast of Wollongong. It was met by three airport firefighting crews. QF63 Sydney to Johannesburg was a few hours into its flight when an issue was discovered, a Qantas spokeswoman said. A pane of glass on the aircraft\u2019s windscreen was cracked, Qantas said. Only the outer of three layers of glass was affected, and the crack \u201cdid not compromise the integrity of the aircraft\u201d, the airline said. \u201cThe aircraft was safe to continue to Johannesburg but the captain made the decision to return as the windscreen will be replaced at Qantas\u2019 engineering base in Sydney.\u201d The plane has landed safely in Sydney. QF63 did not dump fuel. \u201cOur operational teams are working through accommodating passengers or offering them transport home before replacement services are organised,\u201d Qantas said. A spokesman for the Civil Aviation and Safety Authority said he expected Qantas would provide it with reports on both incidents. Casa would then decide whether to launch an investigation. \u201cAs a matter of course Qantas would give us a report on what happened, and it really depends on what it is,\u201d the spokesman told Guardian Australia. \u201cIt could be as benign as a computer indication that a system wasn\u2019t working properly, and the pilot didn\u2019t know what was going on so said \u2018we\u2019ll go back and get it checked\u2019.\u201d He said dumping fuel was standard for long-haul flights that were forced to land earlier than expected. It was necessary to reduce weight so the plane could safely land. Passengers from Sydney will be given cab vouchers and advised of the next available flight. Others from from outside the city will be put up in a hotel by Qantas. In May, Qantas experienced engine problems in a flight from Los Angeles to Melbourne about two hours into the journey. The flight was forced to turn back just two hours after departure. Pilots were forced to shut down one of the engines.",
