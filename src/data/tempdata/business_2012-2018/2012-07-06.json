      "bodyText": "One of the most jarring figures in the labour statistics is a rise in unemployment among African Americans, from 13.6% to 14.4%, double the rate for the white population. The proportion of white Americans out of work was static at 7.4%, and while the jobless rate for Latinos remained high at 11%, it too was unchanged from May. Algernon Austin, the director of the race, ethnicity and economy programme at the Economic Policy Institute, said the figure for black Americans had been hovering at or above 14% for the past three years, even with a 'recovery' supposedly under way. \"It is an extremely high rate to be stuck at,\" Austin said. \"That is the really important news.\" The disparity between white and black Americans has been consistent for as long as statistics have been collated, at least back to the 1960s.

About one in three African American males are estimated to have spent time in jail: two out of three for those without a high school diploma. Despite rising educational standards since the 1960s and better educational attainment than Latinos overall, African Americans are still lagging behind in the job market. One factor important factor behind the African American unemployment rate, according to Austin, is race. \"There is still strong evidence of bias in the labour market,\" Austin said, noting research in which black and white job candidates had been sent after the same jobs and the white candidate been more likely to be called for an interview or offered a job. Bias can even determine the response to resum\u00e9s, he said, with an Emily or a Greg more likely to get a response than a Jamal or Lakesha. Austin attributed the rise in black unemployment in June to more African Americans looking for jobs rather than job losses. African American unemployment was basically in a holding pattern, he said. Austin published a report earlier this month comparing black unemployment levels in 19 metropolitan areas and found Las Vegas as having the highest rate, 22.6%, the Los Angeles metro area 21.1%, Chicago 19.1% and Detroit 18.1%.

      "bodyText": "US unemployment stayed stubbornly stuck at 8.2% with only 80,000 new jobs added in June, dealing a potentially damaging blow to Barack Obama in the run-up to November's White House election. The US bureau of labor statistics, in a jobs report published Friday, said the unemployment situation was \"essentially unchanged\" from the previous month, with unemployment at 12.7 million. The Republicans seized on the figures to say Obama's attempts to stimulate the economy over the last three and a half years had failed. Obama, campaigning in Ohio on Thursday, argued that he had inherited the worst recession since the Great Depression, and that it takes time to turn an economy around. The disappointing figures had been eagerly anticipated by both the Obama and the Mitt Romney campaigns, each knowing that they will colour voters' views on the economy in the run-up to the election. Delving deeper into the figures, the unemployment rate for whites and Latinos is unchanged, but unemployment among black Americans has risen, to 14.4%. About one-third of the jobs gained in June were in temporary services. Manufacturing added 11,000, its ninth straight month of gains. The healthcare sector added 13,000 jobs and financial services gained 5,000. Retailers, transportation firms and the government all cut jobs.

      "bodyText": "Spain's borrowing costs soared back to crisis levels on Friday after infighting among eurozone countries signalled a return to the turmoil that has rocked the global economy in recent months. The interest rate on Spanish bonds touched 7%, leaving Madrid on the brink of asking Brussels for a formal bailout, despite having secured a \u20ac100bn rescue facility for the country's banks. Stock markets plunged and the euro tumbled as investors withdrew funds from the currency zone in favour of safer havens. The euro fell 1% to its lowest level against the dollar since July 2010. Spain's Ibex index of leading shares was down more than 3%. The German Dax fell almost 2% to 6410 and the French CAC 1.9% lower at 3168. The FTSE dropped 30 points to 5662, while the New York Dow Jones index fell 138 points to 12,719. A report on the jobs market in the US added to market tensions after it appeared to show the powerhouse of global growth hitting the buffers. The US added only 80,000 jobs last month, well short of the 200,000 average it managed until March and the 400,000 it needs to bring down unemployment. Christine Lagarde, the boss of the International Monetary Fund, warned that it would lower predictions of global growth in 2012 due to a slowdown in Brazil and China alongside the faltering in the eurozone and US economies. Without revealing what the IMF would conclude in its next report, Lagarde sounded a warning that the near-term prospects had worsened. \"The global growth outlook will be somewhat less than we anticipated just three months ago,\" she said. \"And even that lower projection will depend on the right policy actions being taken.\" Nouriel Roubini, the economist credited with predicting the 2007 credit crunch, said the poor US jobs report was the third in a row and showed the world's largest economy was \"headed to a stall speed\". On Thursday, the Bank of England, the European Central Bank and the Chinese authorities cut interest rates or pumped more money into the financial system to prevent a slump that some economists have warned could be a rerun of the 2008 banking collapse. The Bank of England increased the volume of quantitative easing by \u00a350bn to \u00a3375bn after a series of surveys showed that the UK's double-dip recession could stretch into the autumn. Leaders from the 17 nations in the euro club reached a deal last weekend to give the ECB greater oversight of the bloc's banks and to use the eurozone's rescue funds to reduce countries' borrowing costs. But after going beyond what many diplomats, finance officials and investors had expected, critical elements were left vague. The Netherlands and Finland added to the sense of unease after they broke ranks to demand extra collateral in exchange for loans. They said that without the involvement of the eurozone's main rescue fund, the European Stability Mechanism (ESM), they would need to secure high-grade assets in case countries looking to borrow were unable to pay their debts. Their message was seen as a clear reference to Spain and Italy, which have avoided using the ESM to rescue their banks. In a newspaper interview, the Finnish finance minister, Jutta Urpilainen, said that Finland would rather leave the eurozone than pay down the debt of other countries in the currency bloc. \"You have a Finnish problem. You have a Dutch problem. You have a German problem too,\" a eurozone diplomat told Reuters, pointing to the reservations of those countries about what was announced at the summit and German chancellor Angela Merkel's reluctance to help eurozone partners without strict conditions. Russia confirmed on Friday that Cyprus had asked it for \u20ac5bn of financial help. The country is hoping to avoid the harsh terms imposed on other bailed-out eurozone countries. Russia has already loaned the island \u20ac2.5bn. A meeting on Monday of eurozone finance ministers is not expected to resolve the latest disputes and EU diplomats were keen to play down any significant moves to bridge the gulf between states that demand more austerity and those in need of loans. The meeting's crowded agenda includes discussing the aid package for Spain's banks, dealing with the request from Cyprus for EU emergency help, and whether to ease the conditions of Greece's second bailout. Germany's panel of government economic advisers said in a report that key elements of last weekend's deal were flawed, especially the proposal for a banking union. \"The crisis remains unresolved and new escalations threaten if the existing vicious circle of banking crisis, sovereign debt crisis and macroeconomic crisis is not broken,\" they said. \"For this reason the panel of experts has presented the government with a report indicating ways to end the sovereign debt crisis and the measures needed to stabilise the banking sector in a sustainable fashion.\"",

      "bodyText": "Former Conservative party treasurer Michael Spencer could become the next target of the shareholder spring next week after a leading investor body issued a warning about the pay policies of the Icap broking business he founded and runs. The Association of British Insurers has issued an \"amber top\" warning of potential problem areas around a new bonus scheme. Such a warning is often a signal that investors are preparing to withhold their support or even vote against the pay policies. Amber top alerts have prompted investor rebellions at a number of companies this year \u2013 dubbed the shareholder spring. In a major rebellion at Barclays, 30% of investors failed to back the remuneration report. Icap had already taken steps to try to avert a revolt by cutting the pay and bonuses awarded to Spencer by 25% this year. Spencer is close to the prime minister \u2013 he and his partner were said to have had a \"social dinner\" at No 10 in February \u2013 and he owns 16% of the company that is the world's biggest inter-dealer broker, helping match prices for major professional firms on the money markets. His stake in the company means the pay policies will not be rejected entirely by shareholders, who have held discussions during the year about putting a lid on the amount that can be paid out. Under a new pay policy, the company is setting a floor level of profits at which no bonuses will be payable as well as putting a maximum limit on the amount that will be paid out. But the ABI outlines a number of concerns about the new methodology which some of its members believe sets too low a threshold for the minimum level. Under the terms, the so-called bonus-pool floor has been set at \u00a375m of profits and the maximum bonus pool is 120% of the target figure. Profits during the year were up 1% at \u00a3354m. The company argues that Spencer took a cut in his pay and bonuses from \u00a37.6m to \u00a35.5m in an effort to head off a revolt after one in three investors failed to support the pay policies last year. After the discussions this year, the influential proxy voting agency ISS has recommended voting in favour of the remuneration report and share bonus plan, which is being put to a separate vote. Another proxy voting agency, Manifest, argues that it is still not possible to put a maximum on the potential bonus for Spencer in the current financial year, although the agency issued to shareholders one of its less severe warnings. A spokesman for Icap said: \"Icap significantly revised its remuneration policies in the past year after consultation with its shareholders, and the response has been substantially positive.

Do we also get a TV grilling of DB bosses a la Bob Diamond?</p> <!-- Block 31 --> <p>4.19pm: Finland has been very vocal in recent days/weeks about the problems of the eurozone, and how it will not be a paymaster to bail out struggling members.</p> <p>That seemed to be reinforced today by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/jul/06/eurozone-crisis-live-stock-markets-pressure#block-16\">an interview with its finance minister.</a> Now economist Nouriel Roubinin has looked at the prospect of Finland leaving the eurozone, the Fixit in the parlance. His conclusion? </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p><br>A trigger to increase the chances of Fixit would be a decision by the eurozone to increase the potential losses and credit risk of the core members\u2014including Finland's\u2014via a fiscal and transfer union, debt mutualization and eurozone-wide deposit insurance. At that point, the forces pushing for Fixit may get the upper hand.</p> </blockquote> <!-- Block 30 --> <p>3.56pm: The US jobs figures announced earlier seem a bit Goldilocks - not cold enough to prompt action by the US Federal Reserve to boost the economy, not hot enough to make people think the recovery is happening.</p> <p>Having said that, some seem to think they're actually bad enough to prompt the Fed to act, University of Pennsylvania economist Justin Wolfers for one. Full story on <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jul/06/us-jobs-report-released-live#block-29\">our US live blog </a>on the jobless numbers, but here's a taste:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p><br>My bet is that there's some sort of communication \u2013 a video conference or phone meeting, perhaps \u2013 occurring right now.

If that forecast is wrong, then I'm sure they'll act by the time they next meet. </p> </blockquote> <p>Does he really mean tomorrow - Saturday - or could it wait until Monday once the weekend is over?

We can only imagine he's looking in the mirror repeating \"I cannot comment during the ongoing investigation\"</p> <!-- Block 26 --> <p>2.35pm: Back to matters closer to home.</p> <p>Here's some reaction to Ian McCafferty's appointment to the Bank of England's MPC to replace Adam Posen from Philip Rush at Nomura.</p> <p>He generally welcomed the appointment, although notes that the Treasury failed in its attempts to appoint a woman.</p> <p>He added:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>With two ex-city economists, five career central bankers and one academic, he will become the closest thing to an industrialist the MPC has. So the perspective and experience he is bringing to the table may prove valuable to the MPC.</p> <p>It is too early to call what end of the \"avian scale\" Ian McCafferty will take to. While Chief Economic Adviser at the Confederation of British Industry, he made numerous dovish comments, but it is difficult to disentangle his own views from those of the industry body, whose members wanted looser policy. So he may not be that dovish at all.</p> <p>Indeed, the MPC's former arch-hawk Andrew Sentence (CBE) also once worked for the CBI, not that that commonality need extend that far. For now, we assume he is broadly in agreement with the path that the MPC is taking, but will not be the cheerleader for it that Adam Posen was.</p> </blockquote> <!-- Block 25 --> <p>2.06pm: For more information on the US job figures, check out our US team's live blog covering all the reaction from across the pond <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jul/06/us-jobs-report-released-live\">here</a></p> <!-- Block 24 --> <p>2.00pm: As analysts pore over the jobs report from the US, there's a mixed response to the below-expectation figures.

He adds:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The euro crisis may show up in sovereign debt markets, but the Eurozone's public debt is not more problematic than in other western countries. The Eurozone's 2011 public deficit of 4.2% of GDP was half that of the UK (8.3%) and even less compared to the US (9.6%). At 88% of 2011 GDP, gross public debt levels are similar to the UK (86%) and lower than in the US (103%).</p> <p>It is not the lack of adjustment, either. Italy is on track to meet the Maastricht criterion of a 3% budget deficit ratio this year, after 3.9% in 2011. Tax measures taken last year are bearing fruit and cut monthly borrowing to 2.9% of GDP in June 2012. Italy is far ahead the UK or US in terms of adjustment.</p> <p>The key difference between the Eurozone and other western countries is the role of the central bank. Many central banks have purchased vast amounts of government bonds to stabilise the financial system. The Bank of Japan's asset purchase programme stands at 15% of GDP, the US Federal Reserve's at 17% and the Bank of England has just increased its target to \u00a3375bn or 25% of GDP.</p> <p>The ECB has only bought 3% of GDP's worth of assets. Large-scale long-term liquidity provision to banks has expanded its balance sheet since 2008 by \u20ac1.6trn or 17% of GDP, but LTROs are not quantitative easing: they are largely substituting cross-country private interbank financing.</p> <p>The ECB leaves it to Eurozone governments to convince investors of the desire and ability to continue servicing their debt and sticks to its price stability mandate. This triggers front-loaded fiscal pain and reforms in the South and financial support from northern Europe where markets lose confidence.</p> <p>Without smoothing by central bank intervention, the process remains subject to considerable risks, not least the political risks of reform fatigue in the South and rescue fatigue in the North.</p> </blockquote> <!-- Block 20 --> <p>12.38pm: Here is a <strong>lunchtime round-up</strong>. </p> <p>Rather worryingly, Spanish and Italian bond yields are back at pre-EU summit levels. The Spanish 10-year yield has broken through the 7% danger mark again, up 25 basis points at 7.038%. The Italian equivalent has risen through 6%, another important level - up 5 bps at 6.046%.</p> <p>Turning to stock markets, the FTSE 100 index in London is treading water ahead of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/jul/06/eurozone-crisis-live-stock-markets-pressure#block-18\">key US jobs data</a>, out at 1.30pm BST. It is down 0.4 points at 5692.

In <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/jul/06/eurozone-crisis-live-stock-markets-pressure#block-18#block-14\">Germany, output was up 1.6%</a> month on month. </p> <p>Here in the UK, American economist Adam Posen will be replaced by the CBI's economic adviser Ian McCafferty on the Bank of England's monetary policy committee.</p> <!-- Block 19 --> <p>12.29pm: Adam Posen's replacement on the Bank of England's all-important Monetary Policy Committee has been revealed as Ian McCafferty. He is the chief economic advisor at the CBI and will have big shoes to fill when he takes over from heavyweight Posen, who has been a consultant on economic and foreign policy issues to several US government agencies, the European Commission, the UK Cabinet Office, and to the IMF.</p> <p>Posen has also been a member of the Panel of Economic Advisers to the US Congressional Budget Office, is a visiting scholar at various central banks across the world, has written six books and is a member of the Council on Foreign Relations, the Trilateral Commission, and of the Bellagio Group of international economic academics and officials.</p> <p>McCafferty, who has been in his position at the CBI since 2001, is formerly Head of Macroeconomics at BP and Director of International Economics for Natwest Markets.</p> <p>Posen is off to head up the Peterson Institute in Washington.</p> <!-- Block 18 --> <p>12.04pm: Ahead of the US jobs figures (non-farm payrolls today at 1.30pm BST, after decent US employment figures from the ADP payroll company yesterday) experts believe the numbers will be up 100,000 month-on-month compared with a dismal 69,000 in May. Unemployment levels are expected to remain the same, with any strong rise likely to delay QE3.</p> <p>Here's some thoughts.</p> <p><strong>Michael Hewson</strong> CMC Markets said</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p><br>Even a positive US ADP employment report couldn't mask the concern felt in the markets that stimulus could well be running out of road. Disappointing US same store sales for June came in at their worst levels in three years yesterday, reflecting increasing concern about the economic outlook whatever consumer confidence numbers would appear to suggest.&#xa0;</p> <p>Today's US Non-farm payrolls report will offer important clues as to whether or not yesterday's ADP report was a one-off.</p> <p>Another poor jobs number could well raise expectations of further Fed easing, however given the market reaction to the combined central bank efforts yesterday you have to ask yourself how effective any Fed action would be.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Andrew Taylor</strong> at GFT Markets said</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Tonight's final Non Farm Payrolls before the next FOMC meeting [that's Federal Open Market Committee] will be all about the expectations of the Fed announcing QE3. The current market sentiment is less panicked post EU Summit which means we would need to see a print less than the previous read of 69k for the Fed to move closer to what the equity and commodity bulls are after.</p> <p>An increase over and above the forecasted 90k should see Chairman Bernanke remove his finger from the panic button.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Ilya Spivak</strong> at DailyFX said</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\"US economic data has increasingly underperformed expectations over the past two months, hinting investors are likely to interpret the result in terms of its implications for the likelihood of another round of Federal Reserve quantitative easing.</p> <p>\"Needless to say, a print that trumps forecasts can be expected to have the opposite effect as stimulus hopes fade. A pick-up in the service-sector ISM employment index as well as yesterday's firm ADP print seem to tilt surprise risk toward the latter scenario.\"</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Chris Beauchamp</strong> at IG Index said</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\"Expectations for today's job numbers are that the US economy added 100,000 jobs in June, forecasts having been increased yesterday after a stronger ADP employment report. The unemployment rate is expected to hold steady at 8.2%. A stronger number would provide a much-needed boost to confidence, especially now that eurozone worries are creeping back in, with Italian and Spanish yields pressing higher once again.\"</p> </blockquote> <!-- Block 17 --> <p>11.39am: Our Rome correspondent <strong>John Hooper</strong> gives us a quick overview of Italy's woes and what it means for the country's 10 year bond yield going over 6%</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The rise in Italian borrowing costs to 6% is a bitter pill for Italy's prime minister, Mario Monti, coming at a time when he is making much-resented savings. During the night, at the end of a seven-hour meeting, his cabinet agreed to cuts that aim to slice \u20ac26 billion out the budget over three years.</p> <p>Some will really hurt, like reductions in the number of hospital beds and the funds available for universities. The government's line is that the savings can be made by greater efficiency -- and there is certainly scope for that in Italy.</p> <p>But the politicians who back the Monti government (and keep it in power) are already squirming in discomfort, and it remains to be seen whether they can bear the electoral heat that is coming their way.</p> <p>Cuts directed at the public administration mean that for the first time Monti's non-party, technocratic government is taking on the country's super protected (and super-unionised) state employees.</p> <p>The number of Italy's largely useless provincial authorities is to be drastically reduced. And civil servants will no longer be able to count on a job for life. The government is going to have a tough time getting these cuts through.</p> <p>The fact that government bond yields should be rising against such a background underlines the degree to which they remain vulnerable both to generalised euro zone sentiment and the market's (understandable) fears about Italy's huge public debt (120% of GDP and still rising).</p> <p>But it also highlights the risks to the euro zone of not giving Monti what he tried to get from last week's EU summit -- a mechanism to hold down borrowing costs by means of credible intervention on the bond markets.</p> <p>A lot of Italian (and not just Italian) observers, perhaps influenced by Italy's 2-1 victory over Germany that night in Euro 2012, thought he too had emerged a winner.

This pushed the annual rate of input price inflation into negative territory for the first time since September 2009. And while oil prices currently stand 4% above their average level in June, provided they do not rise any further, annual input price inflation is likely to remain negative well into next year. Meanwhile, output prices fell by 0.4% m/m, causing the annual inflation rate to ease from 2.9% to 2.3%.<br>Given the relatively long lags involved, this points on past form to the potential for core consumer goods inflation to fall into negative territory in mid-2013. So, following a prolonged overshot of the MPC's 2% inflation target, it is becoming increasingly likely that we are now heading for an equally elongated period of below target inflation.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Howard Archer</strong> at IHS Global Insight said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The June producer price data are benign, supporting hopes that consumer price inflation will head down appreciably further over the coming months.

It would also facilitate further stimulative action later this year by the Bank of England should the economy fail to improve.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Chris Williamson</strong> at Markit said:</p> <blockquote> <p>A key driver of lower prices has been the sharp fall in oil prices since their peak earlier this year. Brent crude, for example, dropped&#xa0;more than&#xa0;25% between&#xa0;March and June.

      "bodyText": "6.19pm: This from DB's Q1 interim report: \"Deutsche Bank AG has received various subpoenas and requests for information from certain regulators and governmental entities in the United States and Europe ... in connection with setting interbank offered rates for various currencies\" And: \"In addition, a number of civil actions, including putative class actions, have been filed in federal courts in the United States against Deutsche Bank AG ... on behalf of certain parties who allege that they transacted in Libo-based financial instruments and that the defendants manipulated, through various means, the U.S. dollar Libor rate and prices of U.S. dollar Libor-based derivatives in various markets\" 4.41pm: Liborgate spreads its tentacles.... German market regulator Bafin is reportedly conducting an investigation into Deutsche Bank as part of a wider probe into manipulation of the Libor rate. The bank's shares fell about 4% on the news, even though Deutsche disclosed in its annual report it was being investigated by the authorities. Results from the probe are due in the middle of this month. Do we also get a TV grilling of DB bosses a la Bob Diamond? 4.19pm: Finland has been very vocal in recent days/weeks about the problems of the eurozone, and how it will not be a paymaster to bail out struggling members. That seemed to be reinforced today by an interview with its finance minister. Now economist Nouriel Roubinin has looked at the prospect of Finland leaving the eurozone, the Fixit in the parlance. His conclusion? A trigger to increase the chances of Fixit would be a decision by the eurozone to increase the potential losses and credit risk of the core members\u2014including Finland's\u2014via a fiscal and transfer union, debt mutualization and eurozone-wide deposit insurance. At that point, the forces pushing for Fixit may get the upper hand. 3.56pm: The US jobs figures announced earlier seem a bit Goldilocks - not cold enough to prompt action by the US Federal Reserve to boost the economy, not hot enough to make people think the recovery is happening. Having said that, some seem to think they're actually bad enough to prompt the Fed to act, University of Pennsylvania economist Justin Wolfers for one. Full story on our US live blog on the jobless numbers, but here's a taste: My bet is that there's some sort of communication \u2013 a video conference or phone meeting, perhaps \u2013 occurring right now. So there's a good bet that we'll see a further round of quantitative easing, QE3, sometime tomorrow. If that forecast is wrong, then I'm sure they'll act by the time they next meet. Does he really mean tomorrow - Saturday - or could it wait until Monday once the weekend is over? That surely smacks of panic, which the markets are unlikely to cope well with. 2.57pm: Our City editor Jill Treanor has written about the SFO decision to investigate the Libor scandal. She says: The decision to embark on a formal investigation appears to been taken quickly as on Monday the SFO had said it was considering \"whether it is both appropriate and possible to bring criminal prosecutions\". \"The issues are complex and the assessment of the evidence the FSA has gathered will take a short time, but we hope to come to a conclusion within a month,\" the SFO had said on Monday. You can read her full story here And with that, I'm handing over to Nick Fletcher. 2.51pm: The risks from any direct financial assistance given by the European Stability Mechanism (ESM) to banks, like the payout for Spain's struggling institutions, would remain the responsibility of the country making the request, according to Reuters. It quotes an unnamed senior eurozone official saying: \"It remains the risk of the sovereign because you have the counter guarantee by the sovereign.\" The official added there would be an \"endorsement\" of a rescue for Spain's banks but no final agreement on Monday when finance ministers meet in Brussels. Dampening expectations, perhaps? 2.39pm: Libor scandal update The Serious Fraud Office has launched a formal investigation against Barclays over allegations of fixing Libor after the bank was fined \u00a3290m by the FSA and US authorities. That could make Chairman Marcus Aegius's questioning by MPs on the Treasury Select Committee next week, um, difficult. We can only imagine he's looking in the mirror repeating \"I cannot comment during the ongoing investigation\" 2.35pm: Back to matters closer to home. Here's some reaction to Ian McCafferty's appointment to the Bank of England's MPC to replace Adam Posen from Philip Rush at Nomura. He generally welcomed the appointment, although notes that the Treasury failed in its attempts to appoint a woman. He added: With two ex-city economists, five career central bankers and one academic, he will become the closest thing to an industrialist the MPC has. So the perspective and experience he is bringing to the table may prove valuable to the MPC. It is too early to call what end of the \"avian scale\" Ian McCafferty will take to. While Chief Economic Adviser at the Confederation of British Industry, he made numerous dovish comments, but it is difficult to disentangle his own views from those of the industry body, whose members wanted looser policy. So he may not be that dovish at all. Indeed, the MPC's former arch-hawk Andrew Sentence (CBE) also once worked for the CBI, not that that commonality need extend that far. For now, we assume he is broadly in agreement with the path that the MPC is taking, but will not be the cheerleader for it that Adam Posen was. 2.06pm: For more information on the US job figures, check out our US team's live blog covering all the reaction from across the pond here 2.00pm: As analysts pore over the jobs report from the US, there's a mixed response to the below-expectation figures. One thing is for sure, all eyes now shift to the Fed for their 31st July meeting where Bernanke must decide whether to introduce QE3, or stick with his current plans to shift money around. Out on Twitter: June jobs report is not hot, but also, it's not so bad as to trigger an immediate Fed response. Operation Twist will carry things for now. \u2014 Michael Derby (@michaelsderby) July 6, 2012 We are now averaging just 150k jobs a month this year, LESS than the anemic 153K of last year \u2014 James Pethokoukis (@JimPethokoukis) July 6, 2012 1.38pm: US nonfarm payrolls figures below expectations In June, the numbers rose up 80,000 compared with May at 77,000 - it has been revised up from 69,000) Private sector jobs are up 84,000, compared with May at 105,000, with average earnings up 0.3%. However, expectations were that June would increase by between 90,000 and 100,000, with private sector jobs expected to be up by 102,000. Unemployment remains flat at 8.2% Reaction as it comes. 1.10pm: FINLAND UPDATE Well, that was shortlived. It seems the Finnish threats on the eurozone are now being played done. More details as we get them. Denials right on schedule...RANsquawk: Reports of Finland threatening to quit the Euro are false according to the finance ministry \u2014 Open Europe (@OpenEurope) July 6, 2012 12.46pm: Italy's deficit cutting is actually ahead of the UK and US, says Holger Schmieding at Berenberg Bank. He adds: The euro crisis may show up in sovereign debt markets, but the Eurozone's public debt is not more problematic than in other western countries. The Eurozone's 2011 public deficit of 4.2% of GDP was half that of the UK (8.3%) and even less compared to the US (9.6%). At 88% of 2011 GDP, gross public debt levels are similar to the UK (86%) and lower than in the US (103%). It is not the lack of adjustment, either. Italy is on track to meet the Maastricht criterion of a 3% budget deficit ratio this year, after 3.9% in 2011. Tax measures taken last year are bearing fruit and cut monthly borrowing to 2.9% of GDP in June 2012. Italy is far ahead the UK or US in terms of adjustment. The key difference between the Eurozone and other western countries is the role of the central bank. Many central banks have purchased vast amounts of government bonds to stabilise the financial system. The Bank of Japan's asset purchase programme stands at 15% of GDP, the US Federal Reserve's at 17% and the Bank of England has just increased its target to \u00a3375bn or 25% of GDP. The ECB has only bought 3% of GDP's worth of assets. Large-scale long-term liquidity provision to banks has expanded its balance sheet since 2008 by \u20ac1.6trn or 17% of GDP, but LTROs are not quantitative easing: they are largely substituting cross-country private interbank financing. The ECB leaves it to Eurozone governments to convince investors of the desire and ability to continue servicing their debt and sticks to its price stability mandate. This triggers front-loaded fiscal pain and reforms in the South and financial support from northern Europe where markets lose confidence. Without smoothing by central bank intervention, the process remains subject to considerable risks, not least the political risks of reform fatigue in the South and rescue fatigue in the North. 12.38pm: Here is a lunchtime round-up. Rather worryingly, Spanish and Italian bond yields are back at pre-EU summit levels. The Spanish 10-year yield has broken through the 7% danger mark again, up 25 basis points at 7.038%. The Italian equivalent has risen through 6%, another important level - up 5 bps at 6.046%. Turning to stock markets, the FTSE 100 index in London is treading water ahead of key US jobs data, out at 1.30pm BST. It is down 0.4 points at 5692. Germany's Dax and France's CAC are both down 0.4%, while Spain's Ibex has tumbled 1.3% and Italy's FTSE MiB has lost 0.6%. UK producer price figures showed factory gate inflation easing to a three-year low, while Spanish industrial production data were pretty dire, down 6.1% in May. In Germany, output was up 1.6% month on month. Here in the UK, American economist Adam Posen will be replaced by the CBI's economic adviser Ian McCafferty on the Bank of England's monetary policy committee. 12.29pm: Adam Posen's replacement on the Bank of England's all-important Monetary Policy Committee has been revealed as Ian McCafferty. He is the chief economic advisor at the CBI and will have big shoes to fill when he takes over from heavyweight Posen, who has been a consultant on economic and foreign policy issues to several US government agencies, the European Commission, the UK Cabinet Office, and to the IMF. Posen has also been a member of the Panel of Economic Advisers to the US Congressional Budget Office, is a visiting scholar at various central banks across the world, has written six books and is a member of the Council on Foreign Relations, the Trilateral Commission, and of the Bellagio Group of international economic academics and officials. McCafferty, who has been in his position at the CBI since 2001, is formerly Head of Macroeconomics at BP and Director of International Economics for Natwest Markets. Posen is off to head up the Peterson Institute in Washington. 12.04pm: Ahead of the US jobs figures (non-farm payrolls today at 1.30pm BST, after decent US employment figures from the ADP payroll company yesterday) experts believe the numbers will be up 100,000 month-on-month compared with a dismal 69,000 in May. Unemployment levels are expected to remain the same, with any strong rise likely to delay QE3. Here's some thoughts. Michael Hewson CMC Markets said Even a positive US ADP employment report couldn't mask the concern felt in the markets that stimulus could well be running out of road. Disappointing US same store sales for June came in at their worst levels in three years yesterday, reflecting increasing concern about the economic outlook whatever consumer confidence numbers would appear to suggest. Today's US Non-farm payrolls report will offer important clues as to whether or not yesterday's ADP report was a one-off. Another poor jobs number could well raise expectations of further Fed easing, however given the market reaction to the combined central bank efforts yesterday you have to ask yourself how effective any Fed action would be. Andrew Taylor at GFT Markets said Tonight's final Non Farm Payrolls before the next FOMC meeting [that's Federal Open Market Committee] will be all about the expectations of the Fed announcing QE3. The current market sentiment is less panicked post EU Summit which means we would need to see a print less than the previous read of 69k for the Fed to move closer to what the equity and commodity bulls are after. An increase over and above the forecasted 90k should see Chairman Bernanke remove his finger from the panic button. Ilya Spivak at DailyFX said \"US economic data has increasingly underperformed expectations over the past two months, hinting investors are likely to interpret the result in terms of its implications for the likelihood of another round of Federal Reserve quantitative easing. \"Needless to say, a print that trumps forecasts can be expected to have the opposite effect as stimulus hopes fade. A pick-up in the service-sector ISM employment index as well as yesterday's firm ADP print seem to tilt surprise risk toward the latter scenario.\" Chris Beauchamp at IG Index said \"Expectations for today's job numbers are that the US economy added 100,000 jobs in June, forecasts having been increased yesterday after a stronger ADP employment report. The unemployment rate is expected to hold steady at 8.2%. A stronger number would provide a much-needed boost to confidence, especially now that eurozone worries are creeping back in, with Italian and Spanish yields pressing higher once again.\" 11.39am: Our Rome correspondent John Hooper gives us a quick overview of Italy's woes and what it means for the country's 10 year bond yield going over 6% The rise in Italian borrowing costs to 6% is a bitter pill for Italy's prime minister, Mario Monti, coming at a time when he is making much-resented savings. During the night, at the end of a seven-hour meeting, his cabinet agreed to cuts that aim to slice \u20ac26 billion out the budget over three years. Some will really hurt, like reductions in the number of hospital beds and the funds available for universities. The government's line is that the savings can be made by greater efficiency -- and there is certainly scope for that in Italy. But the politicians who back the Monti government (and keep it in power) are already squirming in discomfort, and it remains to be seen whether they can bear the electoral heat that is coming their way. Cuts directed at the public administration mean that for the first time Monti's non-party, technocratic government is taking on the country's super protected (and super-unionised) state employees. The number of Italy's largely useless provincial authorities is to be drastically reduced. And civil servants will no longer be able to count on a job for life. The government is going to have a tough time getting these cuts through. The fact that government bond yields should be rising against such a background underlines the degree to which they remain vulnerable both to generalised euro zone sentiment and the market's (understandable) fears about Italy's huge public debt (120% of GDP and still rising). But it also highlights the risks to the euro zone of not giving Monti what he tried to get from last week's EU summit -- a mechanism to hold down borrowing costs by means of credible intervention on the bond markets. A lot of Italian (and not just Italian) observers, perhaps influenced by Italy's 2-1 victory over Germany that night in Euro 2012, thought he too had emerged a winner. Subsequent comments by Angela Merkel and others suggest, however, that Italy's triumph on the field was a lot more clear-cut than the one in the conference hall. 11.25am: Some decisive news coming from Europe. In a newspaper interview, Finland's finance minister Jutta Urpilainen said the country would rather leave the eurozone than continue bailing out struggling countries. According to AFP, she said: \"Finland is committed to being a member of the eurozone, and we think that the euro is useful for Finland\" Finland will not hang itself to the euro at any cost and we are prepared for all scenarios. The country still has a prized AAA credit rating and fears any shared responsibility could damage that status. 11.11am: Spanish 10 year bond yields hit 7% Looks like any joy from last week's eurozone summit has well and truly gone. Reaction as we get it, but going past 7%, which means paying back effectively double what you borrow, is usually the trigger for a government bailout. Spain has already had a bailout for its banks but this could be more serious. 11.04am: Better news from Germany, where industry output was up 1.6% month-on-month. It was a huge leap by comparison with the consensus that growth would be just 0.1%. In understated fashion, Germany's economy ministry said industrial output remains \"solid\". 10.59am: Back to Italy. It seems Italian banks have increased their holdings from the ECB. They held \u20ac281.4bn from the ECB at the end of June, up from \u20ac272.7bn in May. Funds borrowed rose last month to \u20ac11.7bn from \u20ac4bn in May. 10.52am: A fake Barclays bus stop advert is doing the rounds on Twitter. Along the lines of \"Barclays, best at fixed rates\" etc. Unfortunately, it's not real. But for a slice of irony and some light relief (hat tip to reader slackrabbit) here is a video of one of the bank's adverts from 2002 featuring Samuel L Jackson. 10.33am: Libor scandal update. The Bank of England's deputy governor Paul Tucker will appear before the Treasury Select Committee on Monday where he will no doubt be defending himself from accusations by Bob Diamond that a call to the bank caused the \"confusion\" that led to the interbank lending rate to be fixed. Tucker hopes to become the next governor at the BoE when Mervyn King steps down, but his rival for the top job, Adair Turner, FSA chairman will also be appearing - according to Reuters - in front of the committee of MPs to show off his credentials. Marcus Agius, the former non-exec Chairman, now executive Chairman, of Barclays will also give his Libor views on Tuesday 10.19am: Last bond post for a bit. Promise. BUT... Spanish 10 year bonds are getting dangerously close to the 7% level economists consider is unsustainable Current yield is 6.94% up 15bps Italian 10 year bonds 6.02% up 2bps The downbeat messages coming from banking officials can't be helping matters. IMF chief Christie Lagarde said earlier today the IMF is set to downgrade its forecast a day after Mario Draghi, ECB head, warned of \"heightened uncertainty\" in the eurozone. We will let you know if Spain hits 7% 10.07am: Here's some reaction to the UK PPI figures. Samuel Tombs at Capital Economics said: The hefty 10% fall in crude oil prices caused overall input prices to fall by 2.2% on the previous month. This pushed the annual rate of input price inflation into negative territory for the first time since September 2009. And while oil prices currently stand 4% above their average level in June, provided they do not rise any further, annual input price inflation is likely to remain negative well into next year. Meanwhile, output prices fell by 0.4% m/m, causing the annual inflation rate to ease from 2.9% to 2.3%. Given the relatively long lags involved, this points on past form to the potential for core consumer goods inflation to fall into negative territory in mid-2013. So, following a prolonged overshot of the MPC's 2% inflation target, it is becoming increasingly likely that we are now heading for an equally elongated period of below target inflation. Howard Archer at IHS Global Insight said: The June producer price data are benign, supporting hopes that consumer price inflation will head down appreciably further over the coming months. This would give the economy much needed support by easing the squeeze on consumers' purchasing power. It would also facilitate further stimulative action later this year by the Bank of England should the economy fail to improve. Chris Williamson at Markit said: A key driver of lower prices has been the sharp fall in oil prices since their peak earlier this year. Brent crude, for example, dropped more than 25% between March and June. At the same time, weak demand and over supply for many inputs has created a buyers' market, meaning companies have been able to negotiate discounts with suppliers. A concern is that oil prices have crept up above $100 per barrel again recently, which will inevitably put some renewed upward pressure on manufacturers' costs in the near future. 9.47am: The Bank of England's new financial risk watchdog published the minutes today from its quarterly meeting. Set up to avoid future boom and bust (where have we heard that before?) the minutes from the 22nd June meeting show the members have no concerns about conflicts when asking banks to reduce credit during the good times. They say It was noted that the primary objective to protect and enhance resilience and the news secondary objective were compatible. Indeed, the committee's recommendations... over the past year had been specifically designed to build resilience while supporting lending and growth. For those who can't remember, the Financial Policy Committee recommended last week that banks should feel free to tap into their cash piles to keep lending. Genius. 9.38am: UK factory gate inflation has eased due to lower oil prices, which will be welcome news to the Bank of England. According to official figures, producer output prices climbed 2.3% in June from a year ago, the lowest annual rate since October 2009, and below City forecasts. Manufacturers' raw material and other costs fell back by 2.3% on the year - the biggest decline since September 2009. 9.31am: Good and bad news coming out of Spain. Bad: Industrial output fell for the ninth straight month in a row in May. It fell 6.1% year-on-year in another real-life example of the crippling effect the problems are having on the country Good: The 6.1% fall was less than the 8.5% that had been predicted, and was at a slower rate of decline compared with the 8.3% drop (year on year) in April. Production hasn't grown in Spain since February 2011. 9.17am: Here's some reaction to yesterday's big moves by the BoE, ECB and China's central bank to stimulate some growth. Most analysts and experts were unimpressed, but some were surprised by the reaction (or lack of) from the markets. Michael Hewson at CMC Markets said: Yesterday's market reaction to the combined policy actions of the Bank of England, European Central Bank and the People's Bank of China is a worrying sign that the drug of central bank stimulus could be wearing a little thin as investors slowly come to the realisation that monetary policy could be starting to reach its limits... throwing more money won't remove the problem of banking systems buckling under increasing amounts of bad debt. Another poor jobs number could well raise expectations of further Fed easing, however given the market reaction to the combined central bank efforts yesterday you have to ask yourself how effective any Fed action would be. Andrew Taylor at GFT Markets said: The overnight flurry of Central Bank action has done little to build confidence in markets as equities and commodities continued on with the negative lead set by the US. As the ECB and BoE fired shots from their depleted stimulatory arsenal, the PBoC decided to join the fray in what looks to be an uncoordinated effort with its counterparts. Gary Jenkins at Swordfish Research said: Three central banks taking action within an hour of one another to try and stimulate the economy and / or boost short term confidence and the market not only shrugged it off but it seemed to actually make matters worse in some areas. It was particularly interesting to look at Spanish bond yields. At one stage in the morning the 10 year was some 22bps higher but after the central bank action it recovered to be just a few basis points away from being unchanged. However it ended the day 36bps wider at 6.74%. So after all the intervention, from both the central banks and the European politicians in the last week, the 10 year is now just 17bps lower than where it was the night before the European summit decision. 9.00am: Italian 10 year bond yield rose above 6% in early trading, but has now settled below the psychological threshold at 5.98%. Over in Spain 10 year bond yields were up 5bps so far at 6.84%. Markus Huber at ETX Capital summed it up: Of much more concern however seems to be the sharp increase in periphery bond yields after yesterday's Spanish bond auctions to levels not seen in two weeks. Slowly the optimism after the last EU summit seems to be vanishing and reality is setting in with weak growth, high debt levels and unemployment once again in the spotlight. 8.46am:IMF chief Christine Lagarde has been speaking in Tokyo this morning, warning about the continuing downturn in the global economy and IMF downgrades. She said: \"In the last few months, the global outlook has been more worrying for Europe, the United States and large emerging markets.\" The IMF will downgrade some of its economic forecasts later this month as economic data from major and emerging economies has deteriorated in recent months, she added. \"The IMF's forecasts are likely to be lower than our previous forecasts.\" Japan's Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda said the eurozone crisis was unfairly hitting the yen. He said: \"Market jitters on eurozone problems, especially one-sided yen rises that do not reflect Japan's economic fundamentals, are inflicting severe damage on economic sentiment.\" You can read Largarde's full speech here 8.28am: Here's today's agenda: \u2022 UK Producer Prices for June at 9.30am BST \u2022 Germany total industrial production for May at 11am BST \u2022 US employment report for June including non-farm payrolls, the unemployment rate and average hourly earnings at 1.30pm BST \u2022 The Bank of England publish the minutes from the latest Financial Stability Committee meeting \u2022 ECB Chair Mario Draghi, Italian Prime Minister Mario Monti and French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius meet for and economic conference \u2022 Greece's parliament begin a three day dabate ending in a confidence vote in the new government on Sunday Meanwhile, stock markets across Europe opened down \u2022 FTSE 100 down 47 at 12897 \u2022 German DAX down 25 at 6511 \u2022 French CAC down 17 at 3212 \u2022 Spanish IBEX down 80 at 6875 \u2022 Italian FTSE MIB down 75 at 14015 And bond markets, which had a decidedly rocky ride yesterday were also suffering \u2022 Spain's 10 year bond yield is up to 6.86% \u2022 Italy's 10 year bond yield is up to 6% 7.52am: Good morning and welcome to another day of action from the eurozone crisis. We will be bringing you up to date with the latest unravelling as we head into the weekend. We are not expecting anything as exciting as yesterday, when we saw the Bank of England introduce QE3 - pumping in an extra \u00a350bn, the European Central Bank reducing interest rates 25 basis points to 0.75%, and China surprising everyone by reducing interest rates for the second time in a month. The FTSE 100 is expected to open down 0.3%, with Germany's Dax down 0.5% and France's Cac off 0.8%. The oil price has fallen back below $100.",

Ricci, who led the internal investigation into the Libor affair, is in the process of setting up a business practices committee to review the existing operations.</p> <p>Even before the political outrage sparked by the record \u00a3290m fine, banks were facing pressure to rethink their investment banking operations because of the regulations and the dramatic downturn in activity in the industry. Bailed-out Royal Bank of Scotland, for instance, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/jan/12/rbs-axe-3500-jobs-investment-banking\" title=\"\">announced a scaling back of its investment bank in January,</a> when 3,500 roles were earmarked for the axe, leaving the investment bank with about 13,000 staff, 10,000 fewer City-style jobs than when it was bailed out by the taxpayer in October 2008.</p> <p>In the past, there had been speculation \u2013 always denied \u2013 that Barclays would spin off its investment banking arm. Analysts at Mediobanca said this story \"may now gain legs\". But for different reasons.</p> <p>\"The Libor scandal may have wider implications for Barclays, with increasing calls for the planned ringfencing of UK retail banking being abandoned in favour of a total split between investment banking and retail banking in the mode of Glass-Steagall [rules implemented on Wall Street after the Great Depression]. Even if this type of separation is not enshrined in law, the new CEO may be under political pressure to carry this process out,\" said analysts at investment bank Mediobanca.</p> <p>That is not to say that Mediobanca or other City analysts regard any break-up as a good idea. Ian Gordon, banks analyst at Investec, said the Barclays investment banking operation did not face the problems faced by RBS, which had businesses which were under performing and needed to be scaled back. \"I'd argue Barclays should trim back on head count to prepare the investment bank for a lower pace of external growth and cut pay rates. But that's different to a full-scale scaling bank,\" he said.</p> <p>For some, this is a moment to split the business in two and focus on the high street operations. Tony Greenham, head of finance and business, of the new economics foundation, said the investment bank and the high street bank should be split immediately. \"Then, in the high street bank, I'd announce a return to decentralised, decision-making model to city and country level and disclose the performance at that level. So the people of Newcastle, say, know what the bank is doing for their city.\"</p>", 
      "bodyText": "The Libor-setting scandal, which on Tuesday forced out Barclays chief executive Bob Diamond, has led to speculation that whoever takes charge at the bank will be encouraged to scale back its investment banking business and focus on the high street operations. The investment banking arm, Barclays Capital, carries much of the reputational risk for the bank but generates at least 50% of the profits. Some even wonder whether it could herald a full-scale split between the two businesses, going even further than the independent commission on banking (ICB) which recommends ringfencing the high street bank. Marcus Agius, the bank's chairman, who will lead the search for a chief executive then step down, indicated this week that a dismantling of the investment bank was not on the cards. But this has not stopped speculation that a change in stance of the BarCap operations is inevitable, not only because of the recommendations by Sir John Vickers' commission, but also because of new international rules set out by regulators in Basel, Switzerland, which require banks to hold more capital against their riskier businesses. Robert Talbut, chief investment officer of Royal London Asset Management, said: \"I expect Barclays investment bank will be smaller and it will have less of a risk appetite than it does currently, although I'm not sure it leads to a full break-up.

Even before the political outrage sparked by the record \u00a3290m fine, banks were facing pressure to rethink their investment banking operations because of the regulations and the dramatic downturn in activity in the industry. Bailed-out Royal Bank of Scotland, for instance, announced a scaling back of its investment bank in January, when 3,500 roles were earmarked for the axe, leaving the investment bank with about 13,000 staff, 10,000 fewer City-style jobs than when it was bailed out by the taxpayer in October 2008. In the past, there had been speculation \u2013 always denied \u2013 that Barclays would spin off its investment banking arm. Analysts at Mediobanca said this story \"may now gain legs\". But for different reasons. \"The Libor scandal may have wider implications for Barclays, with increasing calls for the planned ringfencing of UK retail banking being abandoned in favour of a total split between investment banking and retail banking in the mode of Glass-Steagall [rules implemented on Wall Street after the Great Depression]. Even if this type of separation is not enshrined in law, the new CEO may be under political pressure to carry this process out,\" said analysts at investment bank Mediobanca. That is not to say that Mediobanca or other City analysts regard any break-up as a good idea. Ian Gordon, banks analyst at Investec, said the Barclays investment banking operation did not face the problems faced by RBS, which had businesses which were under performing and needed to be scaled back. \"I'd argue Barclays should trim back on head count to prepare the investment bank for a lower pace of external growth and cut pay rates. But that's different to a full-scale scaling bank,\" he said. For some, this is a moment to split the business in two and focus on the high street operations. Tony Greenham, head of finance and business, of the new economics foundation, said the investment bank and the high street bank should be split immediately. \"Then, in the high street bank, I'd announce a return to decentralised, decision-making model to city and country level and disclose the performance at that level. So the people of Newcastle, say, know what the bank is doing for their city.\"",

We see this as early evidence of a new determination to re-focus the group on businesses that make reasonable returns.  As part of the disposal programme and attempts to simplify the group, costs will be cut in the next two years by \u00a3400m per annum.

      "body": "<p>Europe's crisis is now poised at the moment that divides recovery and renewal from decline and death. Whereas a few weeks ago, commentators and financial analysts argued that only a few months remained to rescue Europe, leading politicians, lurching from summit to summit, have recently talked in terms of days.</p> <p>Summer crises are a familiar feature of European history \u2013 and of financial history. Indeed, the 20th century was shaped by three summer crises, whose seriousness was heightened in each case by the absence of major policymakers, who were on vacation.</p> <p>In two years, Europeans will commemorate the centennial of the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand on 28 June 1914, and the subsequent \"July crisis\" that triggered the first world war that August. On 13 July 1931, the German banking system collapsed, ensuring that what was previously an American economic downturn became the worldwide Great Depression. On 15 August 1971, president Richard Nixon ended the United States' commitment to a fixed gold price, leading to a decade of global currency instability.</p> <p>Each of these crises involved a highly technical issue, but also a much broader set of political problems. And, in each case, the intertwining of the technical and the political produced disaster.</p> <p>In July 1914, diplomats were trying to devise a solution that would permit the Habsburg Empire to deal with the cross-border police investigation that was inevitable after a terrorist attack. Political leaders were thinking about national revival and assertion.</p> <p>In 1931, the experts were preoccupied with the complexities posed by the combination of reparations and war debts arising out of the first world war with large private-sector indebtedness. Populist political movements in many countries were still thinking about national revival and assertion.</p> <p>In 1971, the technical issue concerned the role of the dollar in the international monetary system. But politicians in other countries also felt uncomfortable about the continuing centrality of the US in the postwar order.</p> <p>In each of these summer crises, addressing the technical issue was not enough to solve the problem.

      "bodyText": "Europe's crisis is now poised at the moment that divides recovery and renewal from decline and death. Whereas a few weeks ago, commentators and financial analysts argued that only a few months remained to rescue Europe, leading politicians, lurching from summit to summit, have recently talked in terms of days. Summer crises are a familiar feature of European history \u2013 and of financial history. Indeed, the 20th century was shaped by three summer crises, whose seriousness was heightened in each case by the absence of major policymakers, who were on vacation. In two years, Europeans will commemorate the centennial of the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand on 28 June 1914, and the subsequent \"July crisis\" that triggered the first world war that August. On 13 July 1931, the German banking system collapsed, ensuring that what was previously an American economic downturn became the worldwide Great Depression. On 15 August 1971, president Richard Nixon ended the United States' commitment to a fixed gold price, leading to a decade of global currency instability. Each of these crises involved a highly technical issue, but also a much broader set of political problems. And, in each case, the intertwining of the technical and the political produced disaster. In July 1914, diplomats were trying to devise a solution that would permit the Habsburg Empire to deal with the cross-border police investigation that was inevitable after a terrorist attack. Political leaders were thinking about national revival and assertion. In 1931, the experts were preoccupied with the complexities posed by the combination of reparations and war debts arising out of the first world war with large private-sector indebtedness. Populist political movements in many countries were still thinking about national revival and assertion. In 1971, the technical issue concerned the role of the dollar in the international monetary system. But politicians in other countries also felt uncomfortable about the continuing centrality of the US in the postwar order. In each of these summer crises, addressing the technical issue was not enough to solve the problem. That is true today as well. Indeed, Europe's current crisis reflects exactly the same mixture of elements, each requiring a different type of solution. On the one hand, a complex set of national fiscal crises and Europe-wide banking problems calls for a comprehensive and detailed rescue operation. On the other hand, an underlying European governance problem \u2013 at both the national level and that of supranational European Union institutions \u2013 has been intensifying since the early 1990s. What is now required to resolve the technical issue is some mechanism for assuming existing debt and preventing excessive borrowing in the future. In the US, Alexander Hamilton famously negotiated the federal assumption of states' debt in 1790, but many states behaved badly in the early 19th century, with multiple bankruptcies, until they adopted laws or amendments to their constitutions requiring balanced budgets. The EU needs some fiscal authority of its own if it is to make Europe's economic and monetary union work. It is already a profound peculiarity that customs duties in a customs union are still administered nationally. Hamilton made federal customs houses the key element of his proposal. A Europeanisation of some part of value-added tax would be a tremendous advance in combating the massive fraud that the existing system nurtures. Labour mobility is also incomplete without a common pensions and benefits system: under current arrangements, a worker who spends five years in France, five years in Greece, and five years in Germany is left with a fragmented collection of small entitlements. The crisis has already increased the extent of such migration within Europe. But any solution will be unacceptable unless it finds broad acceptance across Europe, in debtor and creditor countries alike. There is no reason why a constitutional solution that involves debt limitation should not command a large measure of public acceptance, especially in debtor countries, which have experienced the political and economic damage caused by previous profligate governments. What has produced the populist backlash is the spectacle of political authorities devising technically complicated solutions that lack credibility.

The director of the SFO David Green said he had \"decided to formally accept the Libor matter for investigation\" after reviewing the information provided by regulators which last week fined Barclays \u00a3290m for attempting to manipulate the price of the key interest rate known as Libor - the London interbank offered rate. The investigation is understood to be into the wider market and not just Barclays. The decision to embark on a formal investigation appears to been taken quickly as on Monday the SFO had said it was considering \"whether it is both appropriate and possible to bring criminal prosecutions\". \"The issues are complex and the assessment of the evidence the FSA has gathered will take a short time, but we hope to come to a conclusion within a month,\" the SFO had said on Monday.

      "bodyText": "America's recovery from the deepest economic crisis in living memory is grinding to a halt. That is the message from today's payrolls report, and it's bad news for the world's biggest economy, and bad news for the world. Yesterday's rash of rate cuts, from central banks in Britain, the eurozone and China, underlined the fact that policymakers everywhere fear the global economy is sliding into a synchronised downturn. Barack Obama's more aggressive approach to keeping the public spending taps turned on, combined with the Federal Reserve's everything-but-the-kitchen sink monetary policy, has helped the US to escape the worst of the chill afflicting Europe and many developing countries over the past twelve months, and the Fed could yet take yet more action \u2013 perhaps launching a third round of quantitative easing. But with just 80,000 new jobs created in June \u2013 fewer than the 90,000 expected by experts, and far too few to bring down the unemployment rate, which is stuck at 8.2%, it's become increasingly clear that the economy is slowing, even before it plunges over the \"fiscal cliff\" in 2013, when spending cuts and tax rises will put the squeeze on US growth. Few observers think the coming global slump is likely to be as deep or long-lasting as the recession that followed the collapse of Lehman Brothers in September 2008, as confidence collapsed just about everywhere. But that grim episode showed policymakers that in the age of globalisation, there is no such thing as \"decoupling\": today's economies and financial systems are so closely intertwined that if the crisis is deep enough, everyone gets dragged in. With the US also, it seems, succumbing to the collective cold, there is little hope of anything but a grim year for the world economy in 2012. China is expected to reveal next week that its growth rate has slipped; much of Europe (including the UK) is already in recession; and with Spanish and Italian bond yields back at danger-levels, the deal painstakingly assembled at last week's latest \"make-or-break\" euro summit appears to be falling apart. So it's hardly surprising US firms are not in the mood to hire thousands of new staff. Like politicians everywhere in the past twelve months, Obama will no doubt do his best to argue \u2013 with some justification \u2013 that America's slowdown was made overseas. But for the 8.2% of the US workforce who remain stuck on the scrap heap, that will be scant comfort \u2014 and this latest news certainly won't help smooth his path back to the White House.",

This will eventually feed through to consumer price inflation, which is declining \u2013 from 5.2% last September to 2.8%, according to official figures. The slowing pace of price rises is expected to allow real household incomes to steady after four years when inflation has outstripped rising wages by more than two to one. Lower inflation is also expected to give the Bank of England the assurance it needs to boost quantitative easing (QE) beyond the \u00a350bn it sanctioned on Thursday, which took the total to \u00a3375bn. Members of the Bank's monetary policy committee, which sets interest rates, have expressed concern that QE will push up demand and inflation, but the parlous state of the economy has so far more than offset any boost to demand provided by extra QE. Howard Archer, chief economist at IHS Global Insight, said the decline in factory gate prices fuelled hopes that consumer inflation \"will head down appreciably over the coming months\", easing the squeeze on consumers. Factory gate prices are coming down as manufacturers react to lower input costs, according to Archer.
