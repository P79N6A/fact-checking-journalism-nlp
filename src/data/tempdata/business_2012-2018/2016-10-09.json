      "bodyText": "Confidence among chief financial officers at large British companies has only partially recovered from a post-referendum plunge and more than half expect to cut investment and hiring over the coming year, as they fret about the long-term consequences of Brexit. A poll taken three months after the vote to leave the EU shows that 88% of finance officers feel their business is facing abnormally high levels of uncertainty. In the immediate aftermath of the EU referendum on 23 June, the figure was 92%. The survey by consultants Deloitte also shows that risk aversion remains high. The publication of the poll on Monday comes as concern among businesses grows that the government has set a course for a hard Brexit deal, which would leave the UK shut out of the single market and with limited access to skilled workers from overseas. Fears as to the implications for trade, inward investment and Britain\u2019s standing in global markets have knocked the pound to new 31-year lows against the dollar. Against this febrile market backdrop, business leaders wrote to the prime minister, Theresa May, warning that a hard Brexit would cause such grievous damage that it should immediately be ruled out as an option. The government will come under further pressure on Monday as the British Chambers of Commerce urges ministers to restore confidence among businesses as the starting date for Brexit negotiations approaches. At the Conservative party conference last week, May said she will trigger article 50 by the end of March 2017, setting in motion the two-year process of leaving the EU. Publishing a survey showing a cautious mood among businesses, the BCC said guidance on the timing of negotiations went only some of the way to helping jittery employers as they make hiring and spending plans. \u201cBoosting business must be a key task for government in the months ahead,\u201d said the BCC\u2019s acting director general, Adam Marshall. \u201cThe prime minister has given businesses some clarity on the timetable for article 50 and on short-term regulatory and legal issues. This is helpful, but needs to be followed up by a firm demonstration that the government has a clear and coherent strategy to defend the UK\u2019s economic and business interests in the negotiations that lie ahead.\u201d The BCC\u2019s survey of more than 7,000 companies suggested that they had lowered their expectations for hiring, turnover, and investment in plants, machinery and training. The survey results suggested that the economy had avoided a downturn for now and was still growing, albeit at a slower pace than before the referendum, the BCC said. This conclusion echoes other indications that consumers continued to spend and business activity held up over the summer, despite warnings before the referendum that a leave vote could cause a recession. There were also signs of a modest recovery from the initial referendum shock in the Deloitte poll of 124 finance officers. In the days after the Brexit vote, 73% of respondents said they had become gloomier about their company\u2019s prospects. Asked again in September, 47% said they were gloomier than three months earlier, 37% said they felt the same and 16% were more optimistic. The pattern of gloom easing, but remaining widespread, was repeated across other measures. The proportion of finance officers saying now was a bad time to take on risk fell from 95% to 82%. Those planning to cut capital spending in the next 12 months fell from 82% to 58%, with 51% saying hiring would slow, down from 83% in the aftermath of the Brexit vote. Ian Stewart, the chief economist at Deloitte, said: \u201cSince our last survey, we\u2019ve seen the appointment of a new prime minister, a strong rally in equity markets and a solid run of UK economic data. \u201cBut chief financial officers continue to see significant risks in the economic environment and perceptions of uncertainty remain elevated.\u201d Much of the concern over the economic impact of leaving the EU has focused on Britain\u2019s financial sector, a major source of jobs and tax revenue. There are worries that a hard Brexit could push banks to look to cities such as Frankfurt and Dublin as new European bases. Over the weekend, Goldman Sachs played down speculation that it was looking to move a significant proportion of jobs to rival European cities if Britain loses preferential access to the single market. Responding to a report in the Sunday Times saying the US bank was preparing to take nearly 2,000 staff out of London in the event of a hard Brexit, a spokesman said: \u201cWe continue to work through all possible implications of the Brexit vote. \u201cThere remain numerous uncertainties as to what the Brexit negotiations will yield in terms of an operating framework for the banking industry. As a result, we have not taken any decisions as to what our eventual response will be, despite media speculation to the contrary.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Household spending bounced back last month, with people splashing out on theatre trips, restaurants and holidays, according to new figures. UK consumer spending was up 2.4% year-on-year in September, having been broadly flat in August, said payments company Visa. That was the fastest growth since April. The trend continued in September for people to prioritise spending on experiences over buying things. The fastest spending growth was in the recreation and culture industry followed by hotels, restaurants and bars. Contrasting with that, spending on clothes and shoes was down on a year ago. Taking the latest three months together, Visa said momentum remained subdued as households continued to digest the result of June\u2019s referendum on EU membership. \u201cIt is too early to say whether the growth seen in September will continue, and positive signs return more permanently following the soft patch that began in May,\u201d said Kevin Jenkins, UK &amp; Ireland managing director at Visa. The figures, compiled for Visa by data company IHS Markit, showed e-commerce spending increased at the quickest rate since April, up 6% on the year, while face-to-face spending was broadly unchanged from one year earlier, edging up 0.1%. September\u2019s robust spending figures chime with signs consumer confidence also recovered last month, helped by low unemployment, record low interest rates and relatively low inflation. A key gauge of sentiment compiled by market researchers GfK was back as its pre-referendum level in September. But economists warn rising prices could soon sour shoppers\u2019 moods. The pound\u2019s sharp fall against other currencies since the Brexit vote has raised the cost of imports to the UK such as foods and manufacturers\u2019 raw materials. Firms say they will have to pass at least some of those higher costs to customers. There are signs of inflationary pressures in a report from Lloyds Bank on Monday. Its survey of businesses in England and Wales found there was another steep rise in firms\u2019 input costs in September, which translated into higher prices charged for goods and services. \u201cThe weaker pound remains a focal point in the survey data. Improved competitiveness has no doubt given added impetus to the post-EU referendum rebound, but increasingly businesses are feeling the impact of higher import costs,\u201d said Tim Hinton, a specialist in banking for small and medium-sized companies at Lloyds.",

      "bodyText": "The luxury property market in the UK is gradually recovering following the shock of Britain voting to leave the EU, according to one of the country\u2019s leading property agents. Knight Frank said the number of exchanges agreed on homes worth more than \u00a3750,000 was down 20% on last year since the referendum, while the value of commercial property sales in July and August was 47% down on 2015. However, Alistair Elliott, the senior partner and chairman of Knight Frank, said the aftermath of the Brexit vote had been \u201cless dramatic than feared\u201d. Apple recently gave a major boost to the London property market by signing up for 500,000 sq ft of new office space at Battersea power station, while the number of prospective buyers registering their interest in prime residential property in the UK was higher in July and August than in 2015. \u201cIn the first half of this year, UK markets became distracted by the looming EU referendum,\u201d Elliott said. \u201cNonetheless, the fundamentals remain strong and the immediate aftermath of the Brexit vote has been less dramatic than feared. Volumes and prices, especially in the residential sector, are down but activity is gradually recovering.\u201d Elliott said property in the UK looks attractive despite the referendum result, with the slump in the value of sterling lowering the price for international investors and low interest rates meaning that property offers higher potential annual returns than other assets such as bonds. Despite the 20% drop in prime residential property deals, Knight Frank reported that the number of offers being made on properties is only 6% lower than last year with those accepted 6% higher. The number of prospective buyers has also risen. Elliott said this was likely to lead to an improvement in sales volumes in the final quarter of 2016, although the market is still likely to be smaller than last year due to factors unrelated to Brexit, such as the government introducing a higher rate of stamp duty on prime properties and second homes. Sadiq Khan, the new mayor of London, has warned of a clampdown on overseas buyers of property, but Elliott lent his support to the former Labour MP. \u201cLondon needs a balanced housing market and more supply,\u201d Elliott said. \u201cHe is committed to building more homes \u2013 that is good news.\u201d In the commercial market, the Knight Frank boss said companies were hesitant about signing up for new office space, particularly in the City, although 24 of the 31 deals above 20,000 sq ft that the agent had been tracking in central London have been completed. Knight Frank, whose clients include Google, reported a 4% increase in annual revenues to \u00a3461m but a 5% drop in profits to \u00a3153m. Its 550 partners will share a bonus of \u00a384m, up from \u00a380m last year, on the back of the results.",

This week the Sussex-based Bolney Wine Estates will announce a \u00a32m investment to fund further production through a new state-of-the-art winery and major expansion into the US, Scandinavia and Asia. The family-owned business \u2013 founded in 1972 and now headed by managing director and master wine maker Sam Linter \u2013 has enjoyed a steady organic growth, producing 120,000 bottles last year which will rise to 160,000 this year. The company has sold its wines through Waitrose for 16 years, and has been in partnership with Bibendum, supplying Marks &amp; Spencer as well as Wimbledon (since 2015) and British Airways for flights to and from the US. The new investment will allow the vineyard to boost production and supply to 300,000 bottles a year, by 2020, supporting growth in demand across the UK and also for expansion in the US \u2013 due to be launched in New York this week. Provided predominantly by an anonymous private investor, with the second phase from crowd-funding, the \u00a32m will allow the construction of the new winery on the existing site in Bolney, near Haywards Heath \u2013 due to be completed in 2018. The current winery will be adapted to allow more storage space to lay down sparkling wines. Linter said the investment was in response to market demands and confidence in both English wine generally and the Sussex vineyard\u2019s premium still and sparkling wine portfolio, which include the award-winning Blanc de Blanc, Cuvee Rose, Bolney Bubbly, Pinot Gris, Bacchus and Pinot Noir. Linter, who is flying to New York this week to oversee the US launch \u2013 despite her UK harvest still being underway \u2013 said: \u201c We feel this is a huge opportunity in this large market and relish the chance to make English wines very well-known in a country that embraces the craft drinks revolution.\u201d Last month Kent-based producer Chapel Down announced plans to export its sparkling wines across the pond, with the first shipments due by the end of the year. Meanwhile, the Co-op is this autumn introducing its first own-label still white wine and a new sparkling wine 15 years since it launched one of the UK\u2019s first English wines to be available on the high street. The still white, Limestone Rise, is the first English wine to be sold under the Co-op\u2019s premium \u2018Irresistible\u2019 range, and will be priced at \u00a37.99. The wine is produced in Surrey by award-winning English wine producer, Denbies. The new wine will go into fewer than 1,000 Co-op stores, while a new sparkling English wine \u2013 Balfour 1503 Foxwood Sparkling from Kent \u2013 will also go into a limited number of stores.",

      "bodyText": "We hear you, poor people. That was the message that blared out from Washington last week. It came from Christine Lagarde of the International Monetary Fund. It came from Jim Kim of the World Bank. It came from Roberto Azev\u00eado of the World Trade Organisation. It came from every finance minister and central bank governor. The people who run the global economy wanted the world to know that they understood what had caused the Brexit vote and given Donald Trump a shot at the White House. They talked a lot about the need for inclusive growth and a capitalism that worked for all. To those who have been left behind in the past three decades, they said: we get it, we feel your pain. The recognition that there is a problem is progress. Lagarde means it when she says the growing gap between rich and poor is holding back the global economy. Kim genuinely wants to see the fruits of growth skewed towards the bottom 40% in every country. The World Bank, IMF and WTO can sense that they are sitting on the edge of a volcano that could blow at any time. They fear, rightly, that a second big crash within a decade would create a backlash leading to protectionism and the rise of dark political forces that would be difficult, if not impossible, to control. That there are ingredients for a fresh crisis became apparent at various stages last week. According to the IMF, global debt has risen to a record level of $152tn (\u00a3122tn) \u2013 more than double global GDP \u2013 at a time when activity is sluggish. Collapsing commodity prices and weak demand from the west has meant that growth in sub-Saharan Africa is running at half the level of population increases. Companies in the emerging world loaded up on debt during the commodity boom and are vulnerable to rising US interest rates and any softening of the world economy. China is the most egregious example of debt being used to boost activity artificially. The argument that rising debt is fine, because on the other side of ledger is an asset increasing in value, is specious. The only reason the assets are rising in price is because investors are taking on more debt to buy them. At some point, the asset bubble bursts, leaving borrowers with a major problem. This was the lesson of the sub-prime crisis and it is remarkable that memories are so short. The next big one could come from anywhere and it is good that the World Bank and IMF are aware of the risks. Even so, there was an air of unreality about the discussions in Washington last week. The reason was simple: there was not the slightest hint from the IMF or World Bank that the policies they advocated during the heyday of the so-called Washington consensus \u2013 austerity, privatisation and financial liberalisation \u2013 have contributed to weak and unequal growth, with all the political discontent that this has caused. Even worse, Lagarde and Kim seemed oblivious to the fact that the Washington consensus approach is alive and well within their organisations. The IMF\u2019s remedy for Greece and Portugal during the eurozone crisis has been straight out of the structural adjustment playbook: reduce public spending, cut salaries and benefits, insist that state-owned enterprises return to the private sector, reduce minimum wages and restrict collective bargaining. Between them, the IMF and the European authorities are turning Greece into a developing country. It would be fascinating to see what sort of response Lagarde would get if she tried talking about inclusive growth to homeless people huddled on the streets of Athens. The IMF is effectively two institutions. It has a research department that has broken with the Washington consensus and programme teams that operate in the field as if we were still in the 1990s. Lagarde sides with the research team, but the recent package prepared for Egypt was the familiar mix of subsidy reductions, the introduction of value added tax and cuts to red tape. There is not much evidence that those who put it together are on message. As for the World Bank, research by Oxfam has shown that 51 of the 68 companies lent money in 2015 by its private finance arm, the International Finance Corporation, to fund investments in sub-Saharan Africa, use tax havens. That doesn\u2019t square with the idea of inclusive capitalism. It is not immediately obvious why the World Bank is supporting private schools in low-income countries when the evidence is that they exclude the poorest and, in particular, girls. The Jubilee Debt Campaign (JDC) has been keeping a close eye on Ghana, which grew strongly after oil was discovered and commodity prices were rising, but was left exposed by the subsequent crash. More money was then borrowed to blunt the impact of the commodity price fall, but the halving of the Ghanaian currency, the cedi, meant that debt-servicing costs increased. Almost one-third of Ghana\u2019s budget is spent on external debt servicing. In early 2015, the IMF and World Bank said Ghana was at high risk of being unable to pay its debts. Seven months later, the World Bank guaranteed $400m of repayments on a \u00a31bn bond sold to private investors. It had to waive its rules to do so, because the World Bank is not supposed to guarantee loans to countries at high risk of distress. The World Bank said it was trying to help refinance expensive short-term debt and free up resources that could be used for investment, but the winners of this arrangement are the speculators getting a 10.75% return, who will make money even if Ghana can\u2019t repay the loan, due to the World Bank guarantee. The losers will be the Ghanaian people, who will be subject to austerity under the terms of a new IMF programme. Ghana is planning spending cuts by 2017 of 20% per head on 2012 levels. Sub-Saharan Africa is not a homogeneous region. Some countries are still growing strongly, helped by declining energy prices. But Ghana is not the only country to fall foul of the boom and bust cycle in commodities, and the JDC is highlighting the risk of a fresh debt crisis. Neither the World Bank nor the IMF consider this a serious threat. Kim said last week: \u201cI am not yet concerned that we\u2019re reaching a debt level crisis, certainly not in most of sub-Saharan Africa. But we have to watch it.\u201d The World Bank and IMF also need to be watched. There\u2019s nothing wrong with the rhetoric, but it is the performance that counts. Lagarde and Kim say the world needs to make a better fist of tackling inequality \u2013 hooray to that. The work starts with their own institutions. This article was amended on 9 October. It had incorrectly converted $152tn to \u00a31,223tn. This has been corrected.",

There is not much evidence that those who put it together are on message.</p> <p>As for the World Bank, <a href=\"https://www.oxfam.org/en/research/ifc-and-tax-havens\">research by Oxfam</a> has shown that 51 of the 68 companies lent money in 2015 by its private finance arm, the International Finance Corporation, to fund investments in sub-Saharan Africa, use tax havens. That doesn\u2019t square with the idea of inclusive capitalism. It is not immediately obvious why the World Bank is supporting private schools in low-income countries when the evidence is that they exclude the poorest and, in particular, girls.</p> <p>The Jubilee Debt Campaign (JDC) has been <a href=\"http://jubileedebt.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/The-fall-and-rise-of-Ghanas-debt_10.16.pdf\">keeping a close eye </a>on Ghana, which grew strongly after oil was discovered and commodity prices were rising, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2016/jan/26/ghana-success-gold-oil-cocoa-economic-downturn\">but was left exposed</a> by the subsequent crash. More money was then borrowed to blunt the impact of the commodity price fall, but the halving of the Ghanaian currency, the cedi, meant that debt-servicing costs increased. Almost one-third of Ghana\u2019s budget is spent on external debt servicing.</p> <p>In early 2015, the IMF and World Bank said Ghana was at high risk of being unable to pay its debts. Seven months later, the World Bank guaranteed $400m of repayments on a \u00a31bn bond sold to private investors. It had to waive its rules to do so, because the World Bank is not supposed to guarantee loans to countries at high risk of distress.</p> <p>The World Bank said it was trying to help refinance expensive short-term debt and free up resources that could be used for investment, but the winners of this arrangement are the speculators getting a 10.75% return, who will make money even if Ghana can\u2019t repay the loan, due to the World Bank guarantee. The losers will be the Ghanaian people, who will be subject to austerity under the terms of a new IMF programme. Ghana is planning spending cuts by 2017 of 20% per head on 2012 levels.</p> <p>Sub-Saharan Africa is not a homogeneous region. Some countries are still growing strongly, helped by declining energy prices. But Ghana is not the only country to fall foul of the boom and bust cycle in commodities, and the JDC is highlighting the risk of a fresh debt crisis.</p> <p>Neither the World Bank nor the IMF consider this a serious threat. Kim said last week: \u201cI am not yet concerned that we\u2019re reaching a debt level crisis, certainly not in most of sub-Saharan Africa. But we have to watch it.\u201d</p> <p>The World Bank and IMF also need to be watched. There\u2019s nothing wrong with the rhetoric, but it is the performance that counts. Lagarde and Kim say the world needs to make a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2015/oct/13/half-world-wealth-in-hands-population-inequality-report\">better fist of tackling inequality</a> \u2013 hooray to that. The work starts with their own institutions.</p> <ul> <li>This article was amended on 9 October. It had incorrectly converted $152tn to \u00a31,223tn. This has been corrected.</li> </ul>",

      "bodyText": "The chancellor\u2019s autumn statement should be the defining moment between now and Christmas. The moment when Philip Hammond grabs his first opportunity to give the economy a much- needed boost. But now that the markets are falling out of bed it doesn\u2019t look like it will live up to its billing. Instead, currency traders, spooked by the tough talk on Brexit from Theresa May and the intransigence from French president Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, put the skids under the pound and for most of last week made all the news. Hammond looks confident in front of the cameras, but listen carefully and it becomes clear he\u2019s in a spin. While in New York last week, on his way to the International Monetary Fund in Washington DC, he downplayed the British economy\u2019s health and, like a kindly doctor, said it needed some strong medicine. Repeating his conference speech, he said he\u2019d step in to boost growth, which was weaker than many commentators had depicted. A day later, he said the economy was robust, the Bank of England\u2019s August rate cut had prevented a recession and all he needed to do when he stands up on 23 November was adopt a modest number of infrastructure projects. No splurge in public spending to keep the economy barrelling along. Hammond is also twisting and turning as the winds of Brexit swing against him. He is seen as a saviour by many in the pro-EU camp following his conference speech, which put forward arguments for staying inside the EU\u2019s single market. Along with his new team of Treasury ministers, he has energetically consulted with business leaders and made it clear he will do everything in his power to negotiate a special corner of the single market just for Britain. With Greg Clark, the business secretary, he defends the large businesses that are calling for some certainty and reassures them he is batting for their side in cabinet. In the same interview, given in New York while persuading Wall Street bankers their operations in London are safe, he picked out the financial services sector for special treatment. \u201c[It] is a very, very important part of the UK economy,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s the largest single-value contributing sector. And we will place a very high priority on getting the right solution with our European Union partners for the financial services sector.\u201d He went on to argue that it is only the poorest who object to immigrants, and even they don\u2019t mind the highly skilled coming to the UK. \u201cYou will not find, if you walk around towns in Britain and ask people how they feel about migration, that they have a problem with people with high skills and high earnings coming to the UK, because they recognise that those people are a positive contribution to the UK economy.\u201d Yet he knows there is no scheme that Brussels can agree which singles out low-skilled workers from those with high qualifications. Only once outside the EU will Britain be able to establish a points system that grades people according to skills or employability. The long line of EU leaders who spelled out how the free movement of labour must remain a constituent of the single market emphasises the point. Hollande, his finance minister Michel Sapin and Italian premier Matteo Renzi have all hardened their stance. Angela Merkel is less forgiving than she was before May\u2019s hardline speech last weekend and long-time allies the Swedes conceded that they are fans of the common rules and laws, especially free movement of labour. May\u2019s advisers make no distinction between different grades of workers. As she said in her speech she wants more British doctors working in NHS hospitals, just as much as she wants foreign workers stacking supermarket shelves to swap their overalls with British-born workers. No 10 has also let it be known there will be no special deals for the finance sector or any other sectional interests. Being constantly slapped down by his boss could be seen as mightily embarrassing to Hammond. It hasn\u2019t come to that yet because amid all the chaos at the heart of government, it is difficult to discern who has come off worst. Hammond could use the autumn statement as a way out of the flip-flopping that has marked Tory Brexit discussions and what might generously be characterised as his evolving view of the public finances. If the plummeting pound tells him anything, it is that the fears he expressed for the economy earlier in the week should be what guide him, not his more circumspect, Sir Humphrey-esque concern for a measured response. He should do more than tinker. He should give the green light to hundreds of projects already mapped out and waiting for funding. He says the Treasury will not forget about the northern powerhouse and the combined authorities centred on Liverpool, Leeds, Sheffield and Birmingham. If he means that, he could fast-track much-needed funds northwards to where it is needed. The deterioration in the government\u2019s finances will rob him of some spending money. But if abandoning George Osborne\u2019s deficit targets for the next couple of years and keeping the deficit at around 4.5% offers him a few billions of pounds in extra funds, he should spend it. He can\u2019t score any goals with a defensive approach. It\u2019s a time to be bold.",

      "bodyText": "As traders caught their breath on Friday morning, following the pound\u2019s dramatic overnight plunge, one strategist came up with a neat way of explaining the market forces at play. HSBC strategist David Bloom said: \u201cThe currency is now the de facto official opposition to the government\u2019s policies.\u201d In other words, ministers at the Conservative party conference hint at a hard Brexit and the pound weakens, reflecting widespread fears the UK economy will suffer long-term losses and slip down the global rankings. It is a new world for a currency once happy to bend itself to simple rules: generally, strong economic data boosted the pound, weaker indicators hurt it. Now, as Bloom points out, the pound has become a political and structural currency. As the Brexit drama plays out, sterling is subject to the utterances of divided UK ministers and EU officials, and to worries about Britain\u2019s global standing. Bloom also has an explanation for the pound\u2019s path since the vote, which saw it take a dive, stabilise and then, in the last week, another lurch lower. \u201cTo us, the foreign exchange market is exhibiting an uncanny resemblance to the five stages of grief,\u201d he wrote in a research note. \u201cFirst, following the Brexit vote came the denial \u2013 theories circulated whether a second referendum would have to take place. Second was anger \u2013 claims the vote was unfair. Third was the bargaining \u2013 arguments maybe it wouldn\u2019t be that bad, what if the UK followed the Norwegian or Switzerland model. Now, the fourth \u2013 a gloom is prevailing over the pound.\u201d That gloom stems from worries that the government will put a crackdown on immigration above all else in Brexit negotiations. The price it will pay will be to end up shut out of the single market. The upshot is foreign investors find the UK less attractive, home-grown businesses face costly trade barriers, and the lack of access to skilled workers from overseas compounds their problems. Economists see this as a frightening prospect for an island economy reliant on inward investment. Bank of England governor Mark Carney summed up the risks when he warned in January that Brexit could test \u201cthe kindness of strangers\u201d that the UK relies on to fund its hefty current-account deficit. These worries are best expressed in the pound, which hit fresh 31-year lows against the dollar on Friday. Even after recovering from a short-lived \u201cflash crash\u201d to $1.1841 in Asian markets, it was still down more than 1% at $1.2450 as a torrid week came to a close. On the day of the Brexit vote, 23 June, it was just below $1.50. Grant Lewis, head of research at Daiwa Capital Markets Europe, noted sterling was the world\u2019s worst performing currency over the last week. \u201cEven over a longer time period, sterling now sits among a sorry band of currencies in terms of performance \u2013 since the start of the year only the currencies of Angola, Sierra Leone, Nigeria, Venezuela, Mozambique and Suriname have fallen by more.\u201d And there is worse to come, he warns. \u201cSterling\u2019s all-time low against the dollar was $1.05 \u2013 if the government keeps careering headlong into a hard Brexit, a return to those lows is not unimaginable.\u201d Bloom sees the pound at $1.10 by the end of 2017. There are silver linings of course. Tourists have flocked to Britain\u2019s luxury boutiques to buy cheaper watches. For exporters, the weak pound makes their goods more competitive. But to focus on the boon to overseas sales is to forget that the UK imports more than it exports. And those imports, from foods to metals, have become pricier on the pound\u2019s fall. British factories will pass those higher costs on to consumers, and sterling\u2019s weakness will be felt at the tills. And so to the fifth phase of grief: acceptance. Currency traders have already reset their expectations for the UK outside the EU. It\u2019s time the public joined them in accepting a vote for Brexit was a vote for a weaker pound \u2013 and all that comes with it. To QE, or not to QE So, farewell then quantitative easing, aged seven-and-a-half. It was seen as the solution to the economy\u2019s problems during the dark days of early 2009, but Theresa May thinks QE is doing more harm than good and has killed it off. Or perhaps not. There are certainly side-effects associated with the Bank of England\u2019s asset-purchase programme, which will be expanded to almost \u00a3450bn as a result of the new round of stimulus announced by Threadneedle Street in August. The object of QE is to drive down interest rates on safe government bonds and encourage investors to move into riskier assets such as shares and property. Not surprisingly, prices of these assets have gone up, enriching those who hold them. But those with assets in a bank or building society savings account have long been getting rotten returns thanks to rock-bottom interest rates. May\u2019s point is that the better-off have milked the benefits of QE while small savers have been hurt by the policy. The message from her speech to the Conservative party conference could not have clearer: this is not good enough and will have to change. Yet when pressed in Washington about whether this meant the government was contemplating changing the Bank\u2019s remit, Philip Hammond was unambiguous: it had no such plans. Nor does the Bank share May\u2019s view about QE. It accepts that there are distributional effects from asset purchases, but says that without QE, the economy would have grown more slowly and unemployment would be higher. It doesn\u2019t accept that there are winners and losers from QE, rather that some gain more than others. Given that this is the Bank\u2019s strongly held view, it is not hard to envisage circumstances during Brexit negotiations in which Mark Carney tells Hammond that he wants more QE and needs the Treasury to indemnify the Bank against possible losses from the trades. In theory, Hammond could say no. But the smart money would be on him saying yes. Tesco must tread carefully Tesco\u2019s latest offer for investors is a perplexing one \u2013 enjoy an increase in your share price, but then see your credit rating fall. The supermarket group\u2019s share price surged last week after it reported a 1% increase in like-for-like sales in its half-year results, and chief executive Dave Lewis targeted a 3.5% to 4% operating margin by 2019/2020, well ahead of the present 2.2%. However, ratings agency Moody\u2019s swiftly warned that Tesco could face another downgrade to its credit rating \u2013 which is already at junk level \u2013 because of its \u00a35.9bn pension deficit. Despite Tesco\u2019s recovery under Lewis, the deficit looms over the company. Given the repercussions from the BHS scandal \u2013 which saw the failed company left with a \u00a3571m deficit \u2013 and Theresa May\u2019s tough talk on corporate governance, Tesco faces a delicate balancing act if it is to invest in its shops, make payments to directors and shareholders, and repair its pension scheme.",
