      "bodyText": "An inquest has heard an eight-and-a-half minute 999 call made by a driver who claimed his cruise control was stuck, leaving him unable to stop his car reaching speeds of more than 100 miles an hour before it slammed into a stationary lorry on the M40. Kaushal Gandhi, 32, was decapitated when his Skoda Octavia collided with the 18-tonne truck, which was parked in a layby close to where the motorway merges with the A40 in Denham, Buckinghamshire. The force of the impact, in the early hours of 2 February, embedded the car under the lorry up to its back wheels and peeled its roof back. The inquest in Beaconsfield on Thursday heard that the 999 operator was on the line with the driver when his car hit the lorry. Gandhi, who worked for Rehncy Shaheen chartered accountants in Greenford, west London, told the male operator: \u201cMy car is not coming out of the cruise control. I have just passed the exit of the M40 towards Slough. It is not letting me stop. It [the speedometer] shows 70mph, but I think I am going much faster than this.\u201d The operator, from Thames Valley police, asked him if he could slow the vehicle by braking or using the gears. Gandhi responded: \u201cI am trying. It is not stopping at neutral.\u201d A faint beep could be heard as he tried turning off the engine by pressing the start-stop button on the car, which does not have an ignition requiring a key. The inquest heard that the car\u2019s data-recorder was destroyed in the collision but had fed information to the airbag system. However, senior coroner Crispin Butler said this failed to provide evidence of the defects that Gandhi, from Harrow, north London, described on his 999 call. Martin Clatworthy, a vehicle data examiner and safety specialist for Volkswagen, which makes the Skoda, told the inquest that the airbag systems gave the speed, steering, accelerator pedal position and braking of the car in the five seconds before the crash. The car was travelling at 116mph with the accelerator pedal fully depressed five seconds before the crash, while no braking was recorded. It continued to accelerate and hit a top speed of 119mph, with the accelerator pedal pressed two-thirds of the way down. Then just two seconds before the impact, at 94mph (152kph), the accelerator was not depressed at all. \u201cThere is no indication that there was any error or problem with any of the electronic systems of the car in the five seconds leading up to the collision,\u201d Clatworthy said. Police collision investigator Andrew Evans said there were no skid marks near the layby and that the faults Gandhi described meant the Skoda would have had to have suffered a simultaneous mechanical and electronic failure. Applying the handbrake could have saved the driver\u2019s life by forcing the car\u2019s rear wheels to lock up and turn it around so it skidded backwards. The coroner ruled out any suggestion that that Gandhi, who was born in Mumbai, had committed suicide. A postmortem gave the cause of death as multiple injuries, while a toxicology report showed no substances that would have affected Gandhi\u2019s driving. Butler recorded a narrative verdict. \u201cAt the time of the impact the speed of the vehicle was 152kmph. The accelerator pedal is recorded as having been depressed fully five seconds prior to the impact but not depressed at all at 1.5 seconds prior to the impact. The steering input data indicates small deviations left and right during the last five seconds. In the eight-and-a-half minute period prior to the collision, Mr Gandhi had been engaged in a phone conversation with Thames Valley police. \u201cThe vehicle was badly damaged in the collision but subsequent extensive investigations have not revealed any evidence of the faults described by Mr Gandhi.\u201d",

A day later, one such UK pioneer, Edinburgh-based Skyscanner, is being bought by large Chinese travel group Ctrip for \u00a31.4bn, a sum that makes Hammond\u2019s \u00a3400m fire-fighting fund look like a water pistol. The Treasury might argue that it has smaller, earlier-stage companies in mind for its \u00a3400m and that Skyscanner, boasting 60 million users a month for a service that scans the internet for cheap flights, had already achieved scale. That objection would be fair only in part. Skyscanner had indeed achieved profitable success, but one can assume the Chinese are willing to pay 80 times top-line earnings only because they think much more lies ahead. They may be right. Skyscanner has expanded into the hotel and car-rental markets and others could follow. In time, the business could emerge as a serious competitor to the likes of Expedia. In the end, of course, the government can hardly stop entrepreneurs selling their businesses if they wish. Gareth Williams, Skyscanner\u2019s co-founder and chief executive, may also have been tempted by more than a high sale price. The deal brings the opportunity for his firm to tap Ctrip\u2019s deep pool of Chinese tourists in search of international travel. From outside, however, this takeover feels like another lost opportunity for a British-owned company to pursue global leadership under its own steam. Each case is different, but Hammond may discover that the biggest obstacle is cultural. Horizons in the UK are increasingly set to the short-term, and the City\u2019s influence is strong. There are honourable exceptions: note how Baillie Gifford, a Skyscanner investor since last year, said it would have been happy to support further growth of the firm as an independent company. Unfortunately, such an appetite for long-term adventure is rare. The remedy to the problem Hammond correctly identifies is not obvious. But his \u00a3400m, though welcome, is unlikely to be it. Real estate is used to feast or famine, but not like this Forget the government\u2019s plan to ban letting agents from charging fees to tenants. Estate agents\u2019 real troubles are more basic: housing transactions are plunging \u2013 or \u201crunning significantly below 2015\u201d, in the more restrained language of Countrywide, the UK\u2019s largest operator. Feast or famine is a normal state of affairs in estate agency, but, even in that context, change has come swiftly. The share price tells the story. Countrywide floated at 350p in 2013, raced to 650p within a year and was still as high as 600p as recently as May last year, when George Osborne\u2019s help-to-buy schemes were in full swing. Now the shares stand at 170p, down another 12% on Thursday. London, where Countrywide reports exchanges down 29% in the latest quarter, is the group\u2019s biggest headache, but its nationwide volumes for 2016 are still expected to be 6% lower, with a further fall on the cards for 2017. The catch-all \u201cBrexit uncertainties\u201d take some of the blame, but in London the bigger factor seems to be former chancellor George Osborne\u2019s hikes to stamp duty on higher-priced homes in December 2014, and again April this year. Fewer people can afford to buy \u00a31m-plus homes, or they are deterred by the tax bill. In the absence of a U-turn on stamp duty rates by Hammond (no sign so far, despite the hit to the Treasury\u2019s coffers), Countrywide and its peers will just have to wait for wealthy Londoners to accept that their houses may be worth less than they thought. It will happen \u2013 but slowly. No one knows what Brexit means, not even the OBR Give Robert Chote a break. Or, if you prefer, attack the chairman of the Office for Budget Responsibility for the right reasons. In recent years, the fiscal watchdog has generally been too optimistic in its forecasts of how the UK economy would perform. So it is bizarre for hard-line Brexiters now to declare loudly that the OBR is somehow infected by \u201cdoom and gloom\u201d in thinking growth will slow to 1.4% next year. These predictions are always best estimates, compiled in the face of uncertainties. This time the uncertainties are greater than ever. Nobody can say with much confidence how the economy will perform in the run-up to an event as significant as exit from the EU. An estimate of growth of 1.4% seems as good as any. The irate Brexiters should calm down: the real outcome will be revealed soon enough.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Extra funds for new roads, research and development and skills training will drive up UK productivity and put the economy in a better position to withstand the looming Brexit shock. That was the central message in Philip Hammond\u2019s autumn statement and went to the heart of a debate about the UK\u2019s low productivity growth, which according to official figures, has fallen well behind Germany, the US, France and Italy. \u201cThe productivity gap is well known, but shocking nonetheless,\u201d Hammond said on Wednesday. \u201cIt takes a German worker four days to produce what we make in five, which means, in turn, that too many British workers work longer hours for lower pay than their counterparts.\u201d The Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) warned that productivity growth would be lower than it had previously forecast for the rest of this parliament and only return to its long-term trend of 2% in 2020. There have been times when the UK\u2019s productivity growth has reached 5% and closed the gap with other major economies. The 1990s and early noughties were periods of intermittently strong growth. The early 1980s was another. But the 2008 banking crash knocked the stuffing out of the economy and productivity growth has barely moved ever since, allowing the gap to open up again. The commonly used measure of productivity is the rate of output per unit of input. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) says improving productivity results in improved living standards \u201cbecause an increase in productivity translates into an increase in output (amount and quality) without any increase in input (labour and materials)\u201d. There are generally two ways to improve productivity. One is the purchase of better machinery. The second involves a new process, which allows a worker to increase the speed or quality of what they are doing. Quality matters as much as quantity when firms can charge more for higher-grade goods. There is no shortage of academic musing on the productivity puzzle. Senior policymakers have also written extensively about the possible reasons, among them the former chief financial regulator Adair Turner and Martin Weale at the Bank of England. It was Turner who dubbed much of the derivatives and other products sold by City investment banks to their clients before the financial crash as \u201csocially useless\u201d. It was a comment that illustrated how good the Square Mile had been in the previous 20 years selling its services at high margins and taking the cash to reward not just its shareholders but also its workers. According to the ONS, east London is the UK\u2019s most productive area, but it is not only because the Ford engine factory in Dagenham is highly efficient in its use of labour t is also a measure of the high productivity rates still seen among banks in the City. Next on the list of productive cities is Aberdeen, which is home to another of Britain\u2019s high-margin industries: oil. It would therefore be easy to conclude that what Britain needs is more high-margin businesses, where the workforce is a relatively small element of the costs. Rebecca Riley, a research fellow at the National Institute of Economic and Social Research, said declines in banking and the oil industry partly explained the UK\u2019s low productivity rate, but there were also a host of other factors. She also pointed out that most countries had failed to increase productivity since 2008, with many economists blaming it for the stagnation in wages across the north-east of the US that helped to propel Donald Trump into the White House. She said comparing one country with another \u2013 as Hammond did \u2013 was difficult because the value of goods and services fluctuated with currency values. There can also be variations in the way different national statistics authorities measure the contribution of labour and capital in making a unit of production. \u201cBut it is still the case that the UK sticks out against other countries that have at least had some growth,\u201d she said. Studies have looked at whether the near collapse of the banks restricted the supply of credit to companies and prevented them making productivity-enhancing investments. Riley said this would have had some impact. The rapid expansion of mainly low-level service jobs that carry low levels of pay is another reason. In France and Germany, the coffee shop and online delivery culture is still in its infancy by comparison with the UK. These are businesses that provide a valued but unsophisticated service with limited room for productivity improvements. It means the UK has lower unemployment and a bigger workforce, with fewer people economically inactive than France \u2013 but lower productivity and lower pay. In France, and to a lesser extent Germany, restrictions on working hours are other factors at play. For instance, widespread industrial pay bargaining and limits on redundancies make hiring workers a more costly proposition than in the UK. This encourages French and German firms to invest in the latest machinery and limit employment. Bill Martin, a former City economist who is now at Cambridge University\u2019s Judge business school, has argued that the UK\u2019s poor productivity is \u201cmore plausibly interpreted as a symptom of a largely demand-constrained, cheaper-labour economy\u201d. He is not alone in saying that companies would invest in new equipment and be more productive if only there was higher demand for British goods and services from its domestic businesses, consumers and the international community. The UK has seen a much bigger fall in trade as a proportion of GDP than France or Germany in the past eight years, forcing it to rely increasingly on its own economy to drive demand \u2013 a challenge that consumers have met, but businesses have refused to join. The OBR said a planned Brexit in 2019 would further damage Britain\u2019s export sector and push down trade as a proportion of GDP. The fear must be that this will further discourage investment and delay again the moment productivity stages a recovery.",

The 1990s and early noughties were periods of intermittently strong growth. The early 1980s was another.<br></p> <p>But the 2008 banking crash knocked the stuffing out of the economy and productivity growth has barely moved ever since, allowing the gap to open up again.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/nov/23/business-leaders-call-for-tarmac-and-telecoms-from-productivity-fund\">Business leaders call for 'tarmac and telecoms' from productivity fund</a> </p> </aside>  <p><a href=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/economicoutputandproductivity/productivitymeasures/bulletins/internationalcomparisonsofproductivityfirstestimates/2015\">The commonly used measure of productivity is the rate of output per unit of input.</a> The Office for National Statistics (ONS) says improving productivity results in improved living standards \u201cbecause an increase in productivity translates into an increase in output (amount and quality) without any increase in input (labour and materials)\u201d. </p> <p>There are generally two ways to improve productivity. One is the purchase of better machinery. The second involves a new process, which allows a worker to increase the speed or quality of what they are doing. Quality matters as much as quantity when firms can charge more for higher-grade goods. </p> <p>There is no shortage of academic musing on the productivity puzzle. Senior policymakers have also written extensively about the possible reasons, among them the <a href=\"https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/education-less-valuable-than-believed-by-adair-turner-2016-10\">former chief financial regulator Adair Turner</a> and <a href=\"http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/Pages/speeches/2014/785.aspx\">Martin Weale at the Bank of England</a>.<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/nov/2016-11-24T18:10:00/embed.html\" data-alt=\"where productivity would be if crash hadn't happened\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/nov/2016-11-24T18:10:00/embed.html\">where productivity would be if crash hadn't happened</a> </figure>  <p>It was Turner who dubbed much of the derivatives and other products sold by City investment banks to their clients before the financial crash as \u201csocially useless\u201d.</p> <p>It was a comment that illustrated how good the Square Mile had been in the previous 20 years selling its services at high margins and taking the cash to reward not just its shareholders but also its workers.</p> <p>According to the ONS, east London is the UK\u2019s most productive area, but it is not only because the Ford engine factory in Dagenham is highly efficient in its use of labour t is also a measure of the high productivity rates still seen among banks in the City.</p> <p>Next on the list of productive cities is Aberdeen, which is home to another of Britain\u2019s high-margin industries: oil. It would therefore be easy to conclude that what Britain needs is more high-margin businesses, where the workforce is a relatively small element of the costs.</p> <p>Rebecca Riley, a research fellow at the National Institute of Economic and Social Research, said declines in banking and the oil industry partly explained the UK\u2019s low productivity rate, but there were also a host of other factors.</p> <p>She also pointed out that most countries had failed to increase productivity since 2008, with many economists blaming it for the stagnation in wages across the north-east of the US that helped to propel Donald Trump into the White House.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2016/11/archive-2-zip/giv-15726u0xTJLrJMYha/\" data-alt=\"productivity map UK\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2016/11/archive-2-zip/giv-15726u0xTJLrJMYha/\">productivity map UK</a> </figure>  <p>She said comparing one country with another \u2013 as Hammond did \u2013 was difficult because the value of goods and services fluctuated with currency values. There can also be variations in the way different national statistics authorities measure the contribution of labour and capital in making a unit of production. </p> <p>\u201cBut it is still the case that the UK sticks out against other countries that have at least had some growth,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Studies have looked at whether the near collapse of the banks restricted the supply of credit to companies and prevented them making productivity-enhancing investments. Riley said this would have had some impact. <br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>The rapid expansion of mainly low-level service jobs that carry low levels of pay is another reason. In France and Germany, the coffee shop and online delivery culture is still in its infancy by comparison with the UK. These are businesses that provide a valued but unsophisticated service with limited room for productivity improvements.</p> <p>It means the UK has lower unemployment and a bigger workforce, with fewer people economically inactive than France \u2013 but lower productivity and lower pay.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>In France, and to a lesser extent Germany, restrictions on working hours are other factors at play. For instance, widespread industrial pay bargaining and limits on redundancies make hiring workers a more costly proposition than in the UK. This encourages French and German firms to invest in the latest machinery and limit employment.</p> <p>Bill Martin, a former City economist who is now at Cambridge University\u2019s Judge business school, has argued that the UK\u2019s poor productivity is \u201cmore plausibly interpreted as a symptom of a largely demand-constrained, cheaper-labour economy\u201d.</p> <p>He is not alone in saying that companies would invest in new equipment and be more productive if only there was higher demand for British goods and services from its domestic businesses, consumers and the international community.</p> <p>The UK has seen a much bigger fall in trade as a proportion of GDP than France or Germany in the past eight years, forcing it to rely increasingly on its own economy to drive demand \u2013 a challenge that consumers have met, but businesses have refused to join.</p> <p>The OBR said a planned Brexit in 2019 would further damage Britain\u2019s export sector and push down trade as a proportion of GDP.

Dozens of staff who own much smaller stakes in the Edinburgh-based firm are also in line to make thousands of pounds each if they decide to sell their shares. Skyscanner\u2019s chief executive, Gareth Willams, 47, said the firm remained \u201cvery much a British company\u201d and that none of its 500 UK-based staff would lose their jobs. But the sale will raise concerns about foreign takeovers, coming just a day after the chancellor, Philip Hammond, promised to stem the flow of British firms being sold to foreign investors before reaching their full potential. Williams came up with the idea for Skyscanner in 2001 while working as a computer programmer when he grew frustrated at comparing flight prices for a ski holiday. Fifteen years on, he and co-founders Barry Smith and Bonamy Grimes stand to pocket hundreds of millions of pounds in cash and stock by selling their shares to Ctrip. A Skyscanner spokesperson refused to confirm the exact value of the stakes that the co-founders had agreed to sell, but documents filed at Companies House show that they and family members own nearly 30% of the firm between them, suggesting a combined windfall of about \u00a3400m on paper. Sources familiar with the deal said the exact figure could vary because some of the payment would be in Ctrip shares that can rise or fall in value, while some is contingent on performance. Skyscanner, which provides price comparison data on hotels, flight and car hire for 60 million customers, has been rumoured to be considering a stock market float for several years. But executives from the firm have also been in touch with Ctrip for several years and the Chinese firm is understood to have suggested a takeover earlier this year. The deal was announced less than 24 hours after Hammond used his first autumn statement to lament the trend of British technology champions selling out to foreign predators. Hammond announced \u00a3400m of funding for startups to combat the \u201clong-standing problem of our fastest growing technology firms being snapped up by bigger companies, rather than growing to scale\u201d. Anxiety about takeovers from abroad has been fuelled by the \u00a324bn takeover of semiconductor firm ARM Holdings earlier this year by Japan\u2019s Softbank. Other controversial foreign takeovers in recent years include the \u00a312bn sale of Cadbury\u2019s to US snacks firm Kraft in 2010 and the sales of department store House of Fraser and toy emporium Hamley\u2019s to Chinese investors. Williams said: \u201cWe\u2019re very much still a UK company. Skyscanner was born in Edinburgh and we remain completely committed to our offices here. \u201cWe\u2019re operationally independent; we\u2019ve simply gained access to fantastic insights and technologies from a world leading online travel agency, which will make this proudly British company even stronger and even more successful.\u201d Williams added that Ctrip\u2019s size and technological prowess would help expand the company, which pulled in revenues of \u00a3120m and made a profit of \u00a317.5m last year. Nick Thomas, partner at investment firm and Skyscanner shareholder Baillie Gifford, said: \u201cWe would have been happy to support Skyscanner\u2019s further growth as an independent company, but we are reassured that it has been acquired by Ctrip, a business with a strong reputation, in which we already invest for our clients.\u201d Skyscanner was valued at \u00a31.2bn during a \u00a330m fundraising effort earlier this year but the \u00a31.4bn deal price paid by Ctrip values it at 80 times its annual profit. While Williams and his co-founders will sell their shares, the deal hinged on the blessing of the largest investor, venture capital firm Scottish Equity Partners. SEP will sell its one-third stake for more than \u00a3465m, having already sold a tranche of shares earlier this year to make room for new investors. The sale will crystallise a huge return on the \u00a39m that the company invested in Skyscanner in 2007. Skyscanner\u2019s current management team will continue to be in charge of its operations independently after the close of the deal which is expected to be completed by the end of 2016 Nasdaq-listed Ctrip, partly owned by the Chinese search company Baidu, provides online booking for airline and railway tickets as well as hotels and describes itself as China\u2019s largest travel company. It generated more than 350bn yuan (\u00a341bn) of online sales in 2015, according to the company website. The Chinese firm will pay for most of the deal in cash, with the rest in Ctrip shares and loan notes. Ctrip\u2019s co-founder and executive chairman Liang Jianzhang said: \u201cThis acquisition will strengthen long-term growth drivers for both companies. Skyscanner will complement our positioning at a global scale.\u201d The deal, already approved by boards of both firms, is still subject to customary closing conditions.",

      "bodyText": "Britons are expected to embark on a record-breaking \u00a31.3bn online spree as Black Friday kicks off the biggest shopping weekend of the year. The US import has taken the UK by storm, with retailers launching discounts even earlier than usual this year as the battle for Christmas shoppers intensifies. Some of the high street\u2019s biggest names, including Tesco, Argos, Currys PC World and Amazon have upped the ante: offering more discounts, spread over more days, and, in Tesco\u2019s case, opening its largest stores at 5am. The pattern of spending on Black Friday has evolved since Amazon imported the event to the UK in 2010. In 2014 some stores witnessed violent scenes as bargain-hunting consumers fought in the aisles for cut-price widescreen televisions, but by last year the discount extravaganza had morphed into a predominantly online event. The association for online retailers, IMRG, predicted \u00a31.27bn would be spent online on Friday, up 16% on last year. It will be the busiest day in a week-long spending orgy that is expected to see retailers ring up online sales of \u00a36.77bn in the seven days to Monday 28 November. \u201cBlack Friday started out as a single day of discounting, which then became a weekend and now spans an entire week, during which time we anticipate that a high volume of pre-Christmas sales will be made,\u201d said IMRG\u2019s managing director, Justin Opie. It has become increasingly hard for retailers to hold their prices in the face of rivals\u2019 Black Friday discounts as industry sales data shows Britons are not spending more, they are just starting their Christmas shopping earlier. Paul Martin, the UK head of retail at KPMG, said the traditional Christmas shopping period had been distorted by Black Friday. \u201cFor retailers it has always been questionable whether Black Friday really benefits them in the long run, and in the current environment of rising costs and squeezed margins \u2013 perhaps it\u2019s even more so,\u201d he said. \u201cThis year some retailers have decided not to partake, while others have spread their offers out over a longer period in order to ease pressure on logistics and IT infrastructure.\u201d The surge in orders stemming from Black Friday puts major strain on both retailers\u2019 websites and the couriers that deliver parcels. Last year the websites of large retailers, including Argos, Tesco, John Lewis and Boots, crashed due to the volume of shoppers logging on. Now, with more consumers than ever choosing next-day delivery, industry experts think carriers may struggle to keep delivery promises. \u201cSome retailers have gone to great lengths to ensure they are ready and others less so, but even big e-retailers, such as Amazon, have experienced issues on busy days like Black Friday,\u201d said Robert Castley, a senior performance engineer at the digital analytics firm Catchpoint. John Lewis\u2019s operations director, Dino Rocos, said that Black Friday week last year delivered the highest sales in the department store\u2019s 150-year history, with its website experiencing a 300% increase in traffic during the early hours of Friday. \u201cWe are well prepared for the demand but it\u2019s our customers who will decide the exact pattern of trading,\u201d Rocos said. Although many bargain hunters are expected to log on in their pyjamas rather than join early morning queues, Tesco is drafting in extra security at its largest stores, many of which are opening at 5am. The shopping centre firm Intu, which owns the Trafford Centre and Lakeside, said it was expecting an influx of shoppers after experiencing a 30% increase in visitors on Black Friday last year. Gordon McKinnon, the operations director at Intu, said: \u201cEarly signs this year indicate that Black Friday is still evolving as retailers stretch out the sales period.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Directors of the Institute for Fiscal Studies normally avoid hyperbole. They do not tend to use words such as \u201cdreadful\u201d when analysing the state of the economy or the public finances. But that was the term Paul Johnson, the head of the IFS, chose to describe the era of shrinking pay packets triggered by the financial crash of 2007-08. Back in March, the expectation was that average earnings would finally claw their way back to their pre-crisis level by the start of the next decade. The latest forecasts from the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) suggest the Brexit vote means that will no longer be possible. Real wages will still be below their 2008 level in 2021, something that Johnson said had not occurred for at least 70 years and possibly a century. A dreadful record, indeed. He said the UK\u2019s disastrous productivity record was the reason for the sharp drop in earnings in the five years after 2008 and the slow recovery since. Brexit is expected to be double whammy for wages. Productivity growth will be weaker and inflation higher. Real average earnings - pay packets adjusted for inflation - are expected to rise by 5% between now and 2021. That means they will be 3.7% lower in five years\u2019 time than was predicted at the time of the budget in March. Johnson rallied behind the OBR, which some Conservative MPs and sections of the media have accused of producing over-pessimistic forecasts. The IFS director noted that the OBR\u2019s economic forecasts were noticeably more upbeat than the Bank of England\u2019s. \u201cEarlier this month, the Bank projected growth of 1.4, 1.5 and 1.6% in 2017, 2018 and 2019 respectively. The OBR\u2019s projections are for growth of 1.4, 1.7 and 2.1%. That\u2019s quite a big difference,\u201d he said. Slower growth means higher borrowing to cover a bigger budget deficit. By 2020 and 2021, Hammond will be borrowing \u00a332bn more than Osborne was planning, of which \u00a318bn will be due to weaker growth. As the IFS noted, however, there were bigger changes to the borrowing forecasts when the growth disappointed in 2011 and 2012. \u201cThe OBR put \u00a315bn of that \u00a318bn down to the Brexit vote\u201d, Johnson said. \u201cIf that turns out to be the effect, that\u2019s a somewhat smaller hit than many forecasters were suggesting.\u201d Even so, the fresh deterioration in the public finances means that austerity will be extended into the next parliament, assuming that an election takes place in 2020. Hammond has pledged to run a budget surplus between 2020 and 2025, but will need to raise taxes or cut spending by a further \u00a330bn to do so, the IFS said. Balancing the books will become more difficult over the next decade as a rising number of baby-boomer retirees means a bigger state pension bill. The IFS also wonders how long Hammond can resist the pressure for higher spending on the NHS and on social care. By and large, though, the new tenant at 11 Downing Street got a relatively easy ride from the thinktank. Chancellors have become accustomed over the years to getting admonished by the IFS on the day after a budget or an autumn statement. A big crowd always turns up to witness it pick the Treasury\u2019s work to pieces. The IFS found less to complain about than usual. Sure, it tut-tutted about the freeze in fuel duties and was unhappy about the increase in inheritance premium tax, but these were minor quibbles. It liked the fact that the chancellor had decided to dispense with the autumn statement and praised him for coming up with a package noticeably short on gimmicks. It was impressed by the increases in public investment, with Johnson noting that higher infrastructure spending will take public sector net investment to around 2.3% of GDP. That was what Labour was planning before the financial crisis broke and well above the average over the last 30 years. \u201cGiven the choice between jam today in the form of more money in people\u2019s pockets and jam tomorrow in the form of potential economic returns from greater investment, he went for jam tomorrow.,\u201d he said. That decision means the outlook for those on low and middle incomes is bleak. Osborne\u2019s announcement in his summer 2015 budget that non-pensioner benefits would be frozen in cash terms for the entire 2015 to 2020 parliament saved the government \u00a33bn a year, but meant 11m households were on average \u00a3280 a year worse off. Hammond has provided a little help through changes to universal credit, but it will be more than offset by the projected impact of inflation. As a result, the 11m households now stand to lose \u00a3390 a year, saving the exchequer \u00a34.2bn a year. Even so, Hammond will still be borrowing 2% of national income by 2019-20. He is able to do so because he has ditched all three of the fiscal rules set by his predecessor. The IFS noted drily that the policy of borrowing to invest looked remarkably similar to that proposed by Ed Balls during the 2015 election campaign. The then shadow chancellor was proposing to balance day-to-day government spending by 2018-19, but Hammond will not even manage that.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Shares in the UK\u2019s biggest chain of estate agents slumped by more than 12% after the company reported a big drop in London property transactions and warned that Brexit was undermining buyers\u2019 confidence. Countrywide, which operates more than 50 agencies around the UK including Bairstow Eves, John D Wood and Hamptons International, said there had been a 29% plunge in the number of homes it sold in the capital in its most recent three months and warned that profits in the full year would be at the lower end of market expectations. Its shares were the biggest loser in the FTSE-250 index, closing down 12.5% at 169p. The decline came after another knock, a day earlier, when the shares lost 5.3% as a result of the chancellor\u2019s decision to ban letting agencies charging fees to tenants. The poor trading update and fees ban have together wiped more than \u00a375m off the value of the company this week and the shares are now worth less than half the 350p they were valued at when the business joined the stock market in 2013. Countrywide blamed the decline in trading in the capital on fallout from the Brexit vote and changes to stamp duty. The gloomy update came despite evidence of consumers\u2019 resilience in the months following the referendum. Consumers continue to be the main driver of wider economic growth. Jim Clarke, Countrywide\u2019s finance director, said there was a big difference between people spending money on smaller, everyday items, and their willingness to commit to buying a new home. \u201cNo one can really show them what the future is,\u201d said Clarke. \u201cThere\u2019s a real lack of clarity on what post-Brexit Britain looks like.\u201d The company pointed to Bank of England figures showing mortgage approvals were 12% lower in the third quarter compared with the same period last year. Alison Platt, Countrywide\u2019s chief executive, said there was nothing to suggest sales would pick up in the year ahead. \u201cWe don\u2019t expect the market conditions for sales to change over the next year.

While the number of homes sold in London declined rapidly in the three months after the Brexit vote, the number of transactions across the rest of the country was down only 1%.

Let\u2019s be sure there are no unintended consequences here.\u201d The Association of Residential Letting Agents has warned that the policy could be counterproductive, because the costs would be passed on to landlords who would in turn raise rents to recoup the costs. Countrywide said changes to stamp duty in the first quarter resulted in a larger-than-usual supply of rental properties, weighing on rental growth. In some areas, rents fell. Neil Wilson, a markets analyst at ETX, described Countrywide\u2019s assessment of the property market as \u201cvery downbeat\u201d. He said: \u201cThe company says it\u2019s making good progress but today\u2019s trading statement confirms that estate agents are facing a troubled future. \u201cWednesday\u2019s autumn statement bombshell banning letting agents from charging upfront fees to tenants couldn\u2019t have come at a worse time for the sector.

Laughing may be a social skill too far for an economist.

When an economist looks jolly, then you know there\u2019s bad news on the way.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Controversial plans to delete more than 2.5m public records have been abandoned by the government\u2019s company registration agency. Companies House, which maintains a database on every firm incorporated in the UK, listing their accounts and all directors and shareholders, was considering proposals to reduce the amount of time the records of dissolved companies were retained from 20 years to six. The plans provoked an outcry when they became public in August, with warnings that they would hamper the ability to track down white collar criminals and combat money laundering. The deputy Labour leader, Tom Watson, wrote to Theresa May claiming the move would make a mockery of her pledge to tackle corporate irresponsibility. In response to a written parliamentary question tabled last week, Margot James, the parliamentary undersecretary of state at the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy, said: \u201cThe government has no current plans to bring forward proposals to reduce the period of time that Companies House retains records of dissolved companies. \u201cNevertheless, we will continue to keep the retention period under review, during which time the registrar of companies will ensure there is no destruction of records. Additionally, any future proposal to change the retention period would be subject to public consultation.\u201d The question was asked by Martin Docherty-Hughes, the SNP MP for West Dunbartonshire, after discussion with the Asbestos Victims Support Groups Forum UK, which had planned legal action against the government if the proposal went ahead. The forum was concerned that people with the incurable asbestos-related cancer mesothelioma, which can take decades to develop, would have been prevented from obtaining redress from negligent employers. Its chair, Graham Dring, said: \u201cThis decision is good news for victims of mesothelioma and other long-tail industrial diseases who already face an uphill struggle securing justice in the courts. If these proposals had gone ahead it would have denied access to justice to many asbestos victims unable to pursue a negligent employer or their insurer.\u201d The forum\u2019s solicitors, Leigh Day, said the plans \u201cwould have seen thousands of victims of asbestos exposure denied justice\u201d. Police investigators, the National Crime Agency, the Serious Fraud Office, lawyers, journalists and bank compliance teams all make extensive use of the data held by Companies House, with many searches involving dissolved companies and their directors. In June last year, the previously paid-for information was made available free to the general public, leading to a surge in the number of searches. In August, Companies House said this had led to complaints that retaining and providing access to information on long-dissolved firms was inconsistent with data protection law. It said the source of the complaints was members of the public, but there were reports suggesting some MPs were also protesting. Campaigners said that if the proposal went ahead, it would be a major step back in the global fight against corruption.",

      "bodyText": "Thank goodness that\u2019s over. The day after a UK budget or autumn statement is often quiet in the market, as political reaction tends to dominate. Today\u2019s been extra slow, thanks to our US cousins\u2019 turkey-related activities. So European stock markets have sloped lazily to the close of play. The FTSE 100 finished 0.17% higher at 6829, with mining stocks among the risers but National Grid and easyJet both losing 2.3%. The smaller FSTE 250 shed 0.18% -- dragged down by Countywide, which shed 12.5% after today\u2019s profits warning. But Dominos Pizza had a good day, finishing 3% higher after hiking its long-store expansion total to 1,600, from 1,200. Britain\u2019s love affair with takeaway pizza clearly isn\u2019t over. Elsewhere, Italy was the worst-performing major index -- worries over the constitutional referendum, and its banking sector, linger. Conner Campbell of SpreadEx points out that today\u2019s flurry of German data didn\u2019t move the markets much: The Eurozone indices were pretty drab this Thursday, the DAX and CAC managing a meagre 0.1% increase as the day went on. The impact of Germany\u2019s measly 0.2% growth in Q3 seems to have been mitigated by a decent pair of business and consumer climate readings from the country; while they failed to improve month-on-month, the figures from the Ifo and Gfk at least suggest Germany wasn\u2019t too bothered by the US election result. The good news, though, is that Friday should be more exciting; we get the second estimate of UK growth in Q3, plus Black Friday retail action. GW Rating agency Fitch has just declared that Philip Hammond\u2019s autumn statement shows that Britain\u2019s economy will suffer from the vote to leave the EU. In its first official reaction, Fitch says that the forecasts and spending plans outlined yesterday show that the task of bringing Britain\u2019s debts under control has become even harder. It also warned that Britain will suffer slower growth and weaker productivity if Brexit leads to new curbs on migrations (a point the OBR also made yesterday). Fitch says: The Chancellor\u2019s Autumn Statement underlines the challenges for the UK government to stabilise the public debt trajectory in the context of heightened economic uncertainty following the Brexit vote, Fitch Ratings says. Official forecasts by the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) point to a substantially lower path for economic growth compared to the pre-referendum projections underpinning the March budget. The OBR expects GDP growth to be cumulatively 1.4pp lower over its forecast period to 2021. Consumer price inflation will be higher due to a weaker exchange rate. The OBR also believes potential growth in the UK economy will be lower due to a combination of lower assumed productivity and falling net migration. The official forecasts appear consistent with our view that the vote to leave the European Union in the referendum on 23 June will have a negative impact on the UK economy and public finances, as lower growth translates to lower expected tax receipts and higher spending on transfers. Fitch says this justifies its decision to downgrade Britain\u2019s credit rating to AA, the second highest rating, after the referendum. The agency also welcomes Hammond\u2019s decision to ditch the budget surplus target this parliament, and only try to get the deficit down to 2% of GDP. We think this increases medium-term fiscal flexibility, and the OBR\u2019s latest projections indicate that these new objectives will be met, and that the public sector debt ratio will peak in FY18. However, even if the public debt ratio peaks in the near term, any subsequent decline is likely to be slow, and the UK will still have one of the highest debt ratios among highly rated (AAA and AA) sovereigns. You can catch up with all the news, analysis and comment on the autumn statement here, in our comprehensive guide The IFS has also highlighted that pensions are being relatively protected in the autumn statement.... ...while families on low incomes will be squeezed hard this parliament: The IFS is presenting its autumn statement verdict now: Here we go... Workers in Britain face the biggest squeeze on their pay for 70 years as a Brexit blow to the economy knocks wage growth and stokes inflation That\u2019s the official verdict from the Institute for Fiscal Studies\u2019s analysis of the UK\u2019s government\u2019s latest tax and spending plans. Having picked over Philip Hammond\u2019s autumn statement, the IFS said real wages in the UK - pay adjusted for inflation - will still be below their 2008 level in 2021. Paul Johnson, the thinktank\u2019s director, says its the worst squeeze since the 1930s: \u201cOne cannot stress how dreadful that is - more than a decade without real earnings growth. We have certainly not seen a period remotely like it in the last 70 years.\u201d This is the second dire warning of the day -- this morning, the Resolution Foundation warned that the living standards squeeze will actually worsen over the next five years. Newsflash: The Institute for Fiscal Studies is delivering its verdict on the autumn statement right now! And it\u2019s a stinker.... We\u2019ll have full details in a moment... Shares in Countrywide Holdings have fallen to a record low after the estate agent hit investors with a profits warning. It admitted that sales in London have slumped by 29% in the last quarter, blaming the Brexit effect and the recent hike in stamp duty. This sent Countrywide shares sliding; they\u2019re currently down 12.5% at 169p, following yesterday\u2019s 6% slide (due to the government\u2019s new clampdown on letting fees) Anyone who took part in Countrywide\u2019s stock market flotation in April 2013, at 350p per share, must be fuming. Countrywide itself fears that market conditions will stay tough; especially given the uncertainty over Britain\u2019s exit from the EU. Finance chief Jim Clarks says: \u201cNo one can really show them what the future is. There\u2019s a real lack of clarity on what post-Brexit Britain looks like.\u201d Consumer confidence in Germany has inched up this month, according to the latest healthcheck from GfK. GfK reports that Germans are \u201cmore optimistic about overall economic prospects\u201d, and a little more willing to spend. That broadly matches the calm mood among business leaders this month (see earlier). But there\u2019s a proviso.... the data was mainly collected before the US Presidential Election, so we can\u2019t see if Trump\u2019s victory has caused any worries. Europe\u2019s stock markets are showing all the verve and vigour of a Thanksgiving turkey today. Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 has dipped by 24 points to 6793; it\u2019s been bobbing around these levels for a couple of weeks now. Trading across the channel is just as languid - maybe traders are resentful that their US counterparts get the day off. Chris Beauchamp of IG blames American festivities for the lull: The usual Thanksgiving calm has descended across markets, as European investors reconcile themselves to a day of low volumes and quiet trading. With the US out of the picture currencies such as sterling and the euro have managed to recover and move higher, and while stock markets have recovered from yesterday\u2019s lows there is still a sensation that there is not much more than hope to support valuations at current levels. This chart shows how German bosses have taken the triple-whammy of Brexit, Trump and lower growth in their stride this month. Newsflash from Ankara: Turkey\u2019s central bank has hiked its benchmark interest rate to 8%, from 7.5%. The overnight lending rate has also been raised, to 8.5% from 8.25%. This looks like an attempt to prop up the Turkish lira, which has fallen to record lows against the US dollar recently. If so, it has done the trick - the lira has jumped by almost 1%. But it won\u2019t please president Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who yesterday urged the central bank to cut borrowing costs. (weakening the lira) According to the FT, Ergodan declared: I am calling on lenders: please reduce interest rates to reasonable levels. Look at unemployment in the country. If we want growth, we need employment, investment and competition. Unemployment is above 11 percent; is this what this country deserves? The pound has crept to a two-month high against a basket of currencies today, helped by a 0.4% rise against the US dollar to $1.247. Traders continue to yesterday\u2019s autumn statement in their stride. It\u2019s remarkable really -- Philip Hammond abandoned the goal of eliminating the deficit this parliament, and the City just shrugged. The key message seems to be that investors actually like the idea of borrowing to invest -- if the alternative is growth-defeating austerity. But it\u2019s still early days -- especially as Britain\u2019s national debt is heading over \u00a31.9 trillion, or 90% of GDP. Kit Juckes of Societe Generale says sterling looks vulnerable, The Autumn Statement saw more modest downward revisions to growth forecasts than expected, but the cumulative upward revision to the budget deficit path is GBP 122bn by 2020/21. That is more relevant for the Gilt market than for the pound, but there will be heightened concerns about the UK\u2019s credit rating. A lower \u00a3/$ exchange rate is likely The euro is bobbing around its lowest level against the pound since mid-September this morning, at around 84.8p (having hit 92p in October) David Swann, head of pricing at Travelex, says its a boon for anyone fancing a trip to a German market (and frankly, it looks more fun than Black Friday). \u201cThe euro is today at a 72 day low against the pound. This is good news for people planning a trip to Europe and businesses importing goods. People planning to buy their Christmas gifts at a European market can now get approximately 30 euros more when changing \u00a3500 than they would have done three weeks ago. There is of course a negative impact on companies exporting goods and services to Europe, who will now be seen as more expensive.\u201d Just in: German business optimism has dropped slightly, as corporate leaders watch Britain\u2019s exit from the EU and Donald Trump\u2019s US election victory. The IFO Institute reports that its business expectations index has dipped to 105.5 from 105.9 in October. But businesses also reported that trading has improved in November; sending IFO\u2019s current conditions up to 115.6 from 115.1 in October. This left IFO\u2019s main business climate index unchanged for the month. The slowdown in growth in the third quarter of 2016 doesn\u2019t seem to have hurt confidence. Indeed, IFO thinks that German growth could rebound to +0.5% in October-December, from 0.2% in April-June. IFO chief Clemens Fuest says: \u201cConfidence in the German economy continues to be good The German economy seems to be unfazed by the election ofDonald Trump as U.S. president.\u201d Philip Hammond has just defended the Office for Budget Responsibility following criticism over its latest economic forecasts. Some pro-Leave campaigners aren\u2019t happy that the independent watchdog has warned that Brexit will cost \u00a358bn over the next five years. Hammond has been quizzed about it on the Today programme. This is from Andrew Sparrow\u2019s Politics Liveblog: Q: Are you saying you don\u2019t believe the OBR forecasts? The Telegraph says you take these forecasts with a pinch of salt. Hammond says forecasting is not a precise science. The OBR itself says there is a large degree of uncertainty. The government should not ignore these forecasts. It should include them in the range of possibilities for which it plans. It should not ignore the strengths of the economy. And it is right to keep something aside. Q: You seem to be distancing yourself from the forecasts. There is a wide degree of uncertainty, says Hammond. Q: So it may be tosh? Hammond says there are many factors causing uncertainty. Paul Johnson, director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, has given an early verdict on yesterday\u2019s autumn statement. He told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today Programme that: Philip Hammond has decided to spend more. He\u2019s made a very clear choice about how he wants to spend more. He\u2019s not given any more money to the NHS or social care, he has not unwound most of the cuts to benefit spending, so there\u2019s no jam today, but he has increased quite a lot - and this really is I think quite significant - he has increased infrastructure spending, spending on research and development as a way of investing in the economy and hoping that that in improves growth in the longer run. So he\u2019s investing in the future rather than helping people in the short term. We\u2019re looking at about a 10% growth in investment spending, we\u2019re looking at capital spending by the government close to or a little bit above actually what the Labour party was aiming for at the end of its period in office, before the financial crisis hit and the level of investment spending that we have here is well above the average for the last 30 years or so. So on all those measures, actually for once the reality comes close to matching the rhetoric. Investment spending has been relatively protected and these are quite big increases over the next five years. The IFS will give its formal response at lunchtime Bloomberg flags up that Germany\u2019s growth rate has hit a one-year low: Germany\u2019s economic growth was supported by domestic demand last quarter as a slump in exports slowed the expansion to its weakest pace in a year. Government spending climbed 1% and private consumption rose 0.4% in the three months through September, while exports contracted 0.4%, the Federal Statistics Office in Wiesbaden said on Thursday. Capital investment stagnated as spending on machinery fell. Gross domestic product rose by a seasonally-adjusted 0.2% in the three months through September, in line with a November 15 estimate. We also have confirmation that Spain\u2019s economy grew by 0.7% in the third quarter of 2006. That\u2019s a slight slowdown on Q2\u2019s 0.8% growth, but much faster than the eurozone average of 0.3%. Donald Trump\u2019s plans to spend $1trn on rebuilding America\u2019s infrastructure is also pushing the euro down against the US dollar. Kathleen Brooks of City Index explains: The prospect of fiscal largesse under a Donald Trump Presidency, and a multi billion stimulus plan, potentially as early as next year, is a key driver of the stronger dollar right now, as it could free up the Fed to hike interest rates in 2017 at a faster pace than most in the market (60%) think is likely. And that could possibly trigger wild swings in the bond market in 2017, if fiscal stimulus supplants monetary stimulus (ie, bond prices might fall, pushing borrowing costs higher). The euro has fallen to its lowest level against the US dollar since March 2015 in early trading. The single currency has dropped by 0.25% at the open to $1.052, a 20-month low. The confirmation that German growth slowed to just 0.2% in the last three months hasn\u2019t helped the euro. Traders are also getting anxious about next month\u2019s Italian constitutional referendum; votes look poised to reject prime minister Matteo Renzi\u2019s electoral reforms, which might trigger his resignation. But a currency trade has two sides, and the euro is also coming up against a resurgent dollar, as traders continue to bet on higher US interest rates and inflation. The markets now reckon there\u2019s a 100% chance that US interest rates will be hiked next month. Last night, the minutes of the Federal Reserve\u2019s last meeting showed policymakers are confident that the US economy is strong enough to cope with higher borrowing costs soon. So the dollar is also at an eight-month high against the yen, and slightly higher against the pound at $1.242. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Today we\u2019re looking at Germany, with a string of economic data from Europe\u2019s largest economy. New GDP figures have just confirmed that German growth halved to just 0.2% in the July-September quarter, in line with the initial estimate earlier this month. Today\u2019s detailed data shows that net trade dragged Germany back - wiping 0.3% off the growth rate. German exports fell by 0.4% during the quarter, suggesting a weakening in global trade, while imports rose by 0.2%. The figures would have been worse without state spending - which added 0.2% to the growth rate. That\u2019s partly thanks to authorities investing to help migrants who have arrived in the country in the last year. Domestic spending also picked up, by 0.4%, showing that consumers spend more in the shops -- understandably, given that German unemployment is at a record low. So, some of this data is quite encouraging, given the loud calls for Germany to boost consumption to help the wider euro economy. But the drop in exports is a worry. Naeem Aslam, chief market analyst at Think Markets, comments: The German economic data released today has shown that domestic demand has picked up during the third quarter- a sign of improving demand. Having said that the German final GDP number came in line with the forecast of 0.2%. More encouraging signs were in the public spending and construction investment. Given that Germany is very much export based economy, and the export number dropped by 0.4%, it shows that global growth is still weak. Two more surveys should help us see what\u2019s going on: 9am GMT: German IFO survey of business confidence Noon GMT: German GfK consumer confidence survey Also coming up today: The financial markets may be quiet, as it\u2019s Thanksgiving in America. City traders should still be digesting yesterday\u2019s UK autumn statement, and the news that Britain will be borrowing \u00a3122bn more than previously planned over the next five years. The pound actually rallied yesterday, after chancellor Philip Hammond tore up the old goal of fiscal consolidation and pledged to borrow to invest. Paresh Davdra of RationalFX says investors like the sound of Hammond\u2019s new direction for post-Brexit Britain, with an emphasis on investment in infrastructure, housing, and boosting the UK\u2019s productivity. The pound rose slightly during the announcement, with high value investments such as funding local growth in the north and midlands, as well as funds for innovation and productivity, striking a positive note with the markets. However this optimism did not last long as the uncertainty that still remains over the future of the UK\u2019s economy due to Brexit still appears too great for the pound to escape. Today the IFS thinktank gives its verdict on Hammond\u2019s plans. Our Politics team will probably take the lead, but we\u2019ll watch for financial reaction. On the corporate news front, Domino\u2019s Pizza, Mothercare and estate agent Countrywide are all reporting results.",

The OBR expects GDP growth to be cumulatively 1.4pp lower over its forecast period to 2021. Consumer price inflation will be higher due to a weaker exchange rate. The OBR also believes potential growth in the UK economy will be lower due to a combination of lower assumed productivity and falling net migration.</p> <p>The official forecasts appear consistent with our view that the vote to leave the European Union in the referendum on 23 June will have a negative impact on the UK economy and public finances, as lower growth translates to lower expected tax receipts and higher spending on transfers.</p> </blockquote> <p>Fitch says this justifies its decision to downgrade Britain\u2019s credit rating to AA, the second highest rating, after the referendum.</p> <p>The agency also welcomes Hammond\u2019s decision to ditch the budget surplus target this parliament, and only try to get the deficit down to 2% of GDP.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We think this increases medium-term fiscal flexibility, and the OBR\u2019s latest projections indicate that these new objectives will be met, and that the public sector debt ratio will peak in FY18. However, even if the public debt ratio peaks in the near term, any subsequent decline is likely to be slow, and the UK will still have one of the highest debt ratios among highly rated (AAA and AA) sovereigns.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-58370001e4b0da4920d6bbbd\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-11-24T15:01:05.179Z\">3.01pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>You can catch up with all the news, analysis and comment on the autumn statement here, in our comprehensive guide</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/nov/24/guardian-autumn-statement-philip-hammond\">A guide to the Guardian's full autumn statement coverage</a> </p> </aside> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5836fcb7e4b0da4920d6bbac\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-11-24T14:48:36.175Z\">2.48pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The IFS has also highlighted that pensions are being relatively protected in the autumn statement....</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/TheIFS/status/801788323073314816\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Pensioners will feel earnings squeeze less, and more protected than working-age households when prices rise <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/AutumnStatement?src=hash\">#AutumnStatement</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/XOlSZPc7Ik\">pic.twitter.com/XOlSZPc7Ik</a></p>&mdash; IFS (@TheIFS) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/TheIFS/status/801788323073314816\">November 24, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>...while families on low incomes will be squeezed hard this parliament:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/TheIFS/status/801791728789442560\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Next few years will see benefits cuts for low-income working households on top of lower earnings and higher prices <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/autumnstatement?src=hash\">#autumnstatement</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/h1NBtcfF7E\">pic.twitter.com/h1NBtcfF7E</a></p>&mdash; IFS (@TheIFS) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/TheIFS/status/801791728789442560\">November 24, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5836e822e4b0e0ad2d75c8ec\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-11-24T13:20:08.175Z\">1.20pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The IFS is presenting<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2016/nov/24/euro-low-german-slowdown-pound-italian-referendum-business-live?page=with:block-5836e6dbe4b0da4920d6bb3b#block-5836e6dbe4b0da4920d6bb3b\"> its autumn statement verdict</a> now:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/Jack_Blanchard_/status/801775873435324416\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">IFS chief Paul Johnson confirms Hammond is basically following <a href=\"https://twitter.com/edballs\">@edballs</a> economics now.

      "bodyText": "Hermes, the courier group that delivers parcels for John Lewis and Next, has told some drivers it is \u201cmandatory\u201d to work the next two Sundays during the Black Friday rush. The move contradicts the company\u2019s previous insistence that the work was \u201ccompletely optional\u201d and increases safety fears about couriers potentially working 20 days without a break. A field manager for Hermes sent a message to couriers on Wednesday stating: \u201cIt is mandatory that you cover your own rounds this Sunday the 27th and next Sunday the 4th of December. If not you must supply your own cover and informed of who by now [sic] ... No excuses.\u201d The firm responded last week to warnings that long working hours resulting from the rush of online sales around Black Friday could put couriers and road users at risk. It insisted \u201ccouriers are not obligated to work on either of those Sundays\u201d. A Hermes spokeswoman said the note about mandatory Sunday working was a \u201crogue message\u201d, and that it \u201cdid not follow our agreed policies, including the fact that working those Sundays is totally optional\u201d. The confusion comes as the Health and Safety Executive considers concerns raised by Frank Field MP, the chair of the work and pensions select committee, that fatigued couriers working seven days a week could pose a road safety risk. The firm responded by insisting \u201ccouriers are not obligated to work on either of those Sundays\u201d. About 5,000 Hermes couriers already work six days a week. One driver told the Guardian he had refused to work on the Sundays around Black Friday because last year he almost fell asleep at the wheel. He said his manager told him that if he did not arrange cover, he might lose work in the new year. Hermes couriers are classed as self-employed and they argue that insisting they work is not in line with self-employment practices. HM Revenue and Customs is already investigating claims that some Hermes drivers are in false self-employment. The firm denies the claims. Field said: \u201cIf HMRC required any further proof that legions of couriers are being treated as workers, rather than self-employed individuals, they will find it in the latest command Hermes has sent its workforce. \u201cThe idea that the couriers have any real control over whether to accept this work or not is nonsense on stilts. Contrary to what Hermes has previously said, the company is issuing orders to couriers it classes as \u2018self-employed\u2019. We know from previous evidence that, if the couriers do not follow those orders, the consequences are dire.\u201d Hermes said: \u201cA full investigation is under way into the behaviour of this individual [who sent the message], which we find unacceptable. We have also contacted the small percentage of couriers to which the message was sent, to apologise, and have asked them to disregard it. \u201cTo reiterate, our self-employed couriers are free to choose whether they want to provide a service on these Sundays.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Workers in Britain face the longest squeeze on their pay for 70 years as Brexit knocks wage growth and stokes inflation, a leading thinktank has said. Picking over Philip Hammond\u2019s first autumn statement, the Institute for Fiscal Studies said that by 2021, real wages in the UK \u2013 pay adjusted for inflation \u2013 will still not have recovered to their 2008 level before the global financial crisis hit. Paul Johnson, the thinktank\u2019s director, said: \u201cOne cannot stress how extraordinary and dreadful that is, more than a decade without real earnings growth. We have certainly not seen a period remotely like it in the last 70 years and quite possibly the last 100.\u201d Young people have been worst affected by a squeeze on wages since the crisis, and the effects of the Brexit vote look set to prolong that pain well into a second decade, on the IFS\u2019s reckoning. Pensioners, on the other hand, would be largely protected from an expected sharp pickup in inflation on the back of a weaker pound. The thinktank also said Hammond had done little to put \u201cmore money in people\u2019s pockets\u201d despite government pledges to help \u201cjust about managing\u201d families or Jams. In fact, the impact of rising costs and a benefits freeze announced by George Osborne in 2015 would leave working households worse off. \u201cGiven the choice between jam today in the form of more money in people\u2019s pockets and jam tomorrow in the form of potential economic returns from greater investment, he went for jam tomorrow,\u201d it said. The IFS analysis follow signs that the pound\u2019s sharp fall since the referendum result is hiking the cost of UK imports and could soon be passed on to consumers. Pricing rows over products such as Marmite and Walkers crisps have put shoppers on alert for rising weekly bills. At the same time, experts say pay growth will stall as companies curb spending while they grapple with political and economic uncertainty. The government\u2019s independent forecasters, the Office for Budget Responsibility, said on Wednesday that the economy would slow next year and inflation would rise, with knock-on effects for household budgets and the government\u2019s finances. Those forecasts were picked up in a separate analysis from the Resolution Foundation thinktank showing that families faced a worse squeeze on their living standards over the next five years than they suffered in the wake of the financial crisis. Its report suggested average earnings were set to grow only half as rapidly as in the austerity years after the economic crisis. At the same time, living standards would be undermined by higher inflation and ongoing welfare cuts. The foundation\u2019s director, Torsten Bell, said: \u201cThe combination of lower growth, higher inflation and the government\u2019s decision to press ahead with big welfare cuts means that households risk experiencing even slower income growth in this parliament than they saw in the aftermath of the financial crisis. \u201cBut unlike the last parliament, it will be low and middle-income households who feel the tightest squeeze this time round.\u201d The IFS also highlighted a stark contrast in the prospects of young and old as the Brexit process unfolds and exacerbates existing divisions between age groups. It said most people would face similar changes in costs as inflation picks up, but what varied by age group was the extent to which income could keep pace with those costs. Some forms of income, such as pensions, are protected from inflation because they rise to offset higher prices. Others, however, are not, including working-age benefits, which were frozen in Osborne\u2019s 2015 post-election budget. At the same time, younger people see their income from work squeezed by inflation if pay rises fail to keep pace with living costs. Campaigners said the likely blow to younger people exposed the unfairness of the the government\u2019s triple-lock system, which has seen pensions rise every year since 2010 by the rate of inflation, average earnings or a minimum of 2.5%, whichever is higher. Ashley Seager, the co-founder of the Intergenerational Foundation, said: \u201cThe government must stop caving in to the old-age lobby and say enough is enough. It cannot be right that 2 million wealthy oldies who need help the least are universally protected, while the young, who need help the most, are left to pick up the bill. The triple lock must go.\u201d The government has also faced criticism for presenting a partial reversal of planned cuts to universal credit as a boost to working households when in reality the giveaways will be more than offset by other cuts announced in 2015. Hammond said in his autumn statement that 3m households would be better off as as result of changes to universal credit, which he described as a \u201ctargeted tax cut worth \u00a3700m from 2021-22\u201d. Frank Field, the Labour chair of the commons work and pensions committee, said only a small fraction of the 3m households would benefit in the short term. \u201cThe \u00a3700m value of the taper change by 2021-22 only goes a small way towards offsetting the \u00a33bn hit to working families caused by previously announced cuts to universal credit work allowances,\u201d he said. The IFS presented its outlook for living standards as the Treasury and eurosceptic MPs rowed over the OBR\u2019s forecasts for Britain as it goes through Brexit. In response to anti-EU MPs\u2019 attacks on the OBR for being overly pessimistic, the IFS noted the watchdog\u2019s growth forecasts were \u201cnoticeably more upbeat than the Bank of England\u2019s\u201d. \u201cOverall, despite some of the headlines, I think we can count the OBR as having been modestly upbeat relative to some other forecasters,\u201d said Johnson. \u201cEven so, the outlook for living standards and for the public finances has deteriorated pretty sharply over the last nine months. Mr Hammond has responded by increasing capital spending and hence increasing borrowing further.\u201d Hammond also defended the OBR on Thursday, saying the government would be wrong to ignore its forecasts and that \u201ceconomic forecasting is not a precise science\u201d.",

At the same time, younger people see their income from work squeezed by inflation if pay rises fail to keep pace with living costs.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/nov/2016-11-24T18:44:33/embed.html\" data-alt=\"Benefits freeze effects\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/nov/2016-11-24T18:44:33/embed.html\">Benefits freeze effects</a> </figure>  <p>Campaigners said the likely blow to younger people exposed the unfairness of the the government\u2019s triple-lock system, which has seen pensions rise every year since 2010 by the rate of inflation, average earnings or a minimum of 2.5%, whichever is higher.</p> <p>Ashley Seager, the co-founder of the Intergenerational Foundation, said: \u201cThe government must stop caving in to the old-age lobby and say enough is enough. It cannot be right that 2 million wealthy oldies who need help the least are universally protected, while the young, who need help the most, are left to pick up the bill. The triple lock must go.\u201d</p> <p>The government has also faced criticism for presenting a partial reversal of planned cuts to universal credit as a boost to working households when in reality the giveaways will be more than offset by other cuts announced in 2015. </p> <p>Hammond said in his autumn statement that 3m households would be better off as as result of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/nov/23/key-points-autumn-statement-at-a-glance\">changes to universal credit</a>, which he described as a \u201ctargeted tax cut worth \u00a3700m from 2021-22\u201d. </p> <p>Frank Field, the Labour chair of the commons work and pensions committee, said only a small fraction of the 3m households would benefit in the short term.</p> <p>\u201cThe \u00a3700m value of the taper change by 2021-22 only goes a small way towards offsetting the \u00a33bn hit to working families caused by previously announced cuts to universal credit work allowances,\u201d he said.</p> <p>The IFS presented its outlook for living standards as the Treasury and eurosceptic MPs rowed over <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/nov/23/brexit-uncertainty-will-hold-uk-gdp-growth-back-says-obr\">the OBR\u2019s forecasts for Britain as it goes through Brexit</a>. </p> <p>In response to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/nov/24/ministers-defend-obr-after-pro-brexit-tories-accuse-it-of-scaremongering-politics-live?page=with:block-5836a53ae4b0e0ad2d75c794#block-5836a53ae4b0e0ad2d75c794\">anti-EU MPs\u2019 attacks on the OBR for being overly pessimistic</a>, the IFS noted the watchdog\u2019s growth forecasts were \u201cnoticeably more upbeat than the Bank of England\u2019s\u201d.<br></p> <p>\u201cOverall, despite some of the headlines, I think we can count the OBR as having been modestly upbeat relative to some other forecasters,\u201d said Johnson. \u201cEven so, the outlook for living standards and for the public finances has deteriorated pretty sharply over the last nine months.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "It is estimated that today\u2019s obesity epidemic costs the global economy about $2tn (\u00a31.6tn) or some 3% of GDP. For individuals, deciding what to eat is a jealously guarded privilege, but for economists obesity is not really about people exercising free-market choice. Instead it is a market failure. The causes of the epidemic are complex, spanning the social sciences to biology and technology. Consider, for example, the shift towards urbanisation and car transport. By reducing many people\u2019s daily physical activity, these are estimated together to reduce individuals\u2019 need for food by 300 calories a day. So how much less food should the car driver eat to compensate? About one biscuit less a day \u2013 a trivial change that only goes to illustrate that few of us really understand the energy needs of our bodies. In market terms, making a rational choice at the dining table requires people to know how much energy they need and how much they are getting \u2013 yet neither of these is known. As any one who has ever tried to lose weight knows, in these matters talk is cheap and advice is unreliable. At various times sugar, protein, fat, starch, fast food, home cooking and snacks have all been held to be responsible for the obesity epidemic. Back in the 1950s, the dominant theory was that eating fat was responsible for making you obese \u2013 and by sating appetite, sugar could help to reduce weight gain. However, food companies prefer to deflect rhetoric about poor diet being the primary cause of obesity, and instead promote messages focused on exercise and other factors \u2013 a phenomenon termed \u201cleanwashing\u201d. Nonetheless, the political spotlight is now on sugar, with \u201cenvironmental\u201d changes proposed to reduce the appeal of sugary foods, such as warning labels and nutritional information panels. There\u2019s serious talk of taxing them, in the way that tobacco has been. None of this is supported by any real evidence, but certainly new taxes are always popular with governments. (It\u2019s pretty obvious, after all, that there are plenty of thin children who enjoy sugary foods, and plenty of overweight people whose tastes lie elsewhere.) Prof Kevin Fenton, national director for health and wellbeing at Public Health England, says there are \u201cpractical solutions\u201d, by which he means a de-sugaring of foods such as cakes, biscuits and puddings. But these foods are not sugary by accident \u2013 they are sugary because that\u2019s what we like about them. It\u2019s like salted crisps having salt removed \u2026 but yes, the health industry has pushed that one too. Solutions based on labelling of foods by calorific content to improve consumer choices belie both human psychology and the complexity of the body\u2019s digestive mechanisms. As a result, it is futile leaving a solution to the food and drink industry, or on relying on \u201ceducation\u201d to correct consumer behaviour. However, consumer choices are being skewed by government actions, such as massive programmes of agricultural support that actually favour fast foods over healthy eating. Billions of dollars go towards subsidising junk foods, through farm subsidies for producing ingredients such as soya and high-glucose corn syrup. Obesity affects poor households far more than their richer neighbours \u2013 and the cost of eating healthily is a very practical reason why. And, as the US economist Richard McKenzie has pointed out, much of the rise of obesity is precisely a consequence of free-market economics. For example, fast food has become cheaper, in part because of mechanisation and in part because the workers producing it are paid less and less. At the same time, the economic forces that propelled 1960s women away from the kitchen and into jobs also propelled families towards processed foodstuffs and eating out \u2026 or just snacking. When markets go wrong, governments need to step in. Agricultural support should be switched away from junk foods and towards producing healthy ones. The low wages and poor training that fast-food outlets rely on should be made a thing of the past, and tax incentives (such as zero VAT) should support the labour-intensive production of \u201creal food\u201d in cafes and restaurants. Market corrections, rather than punitive moves aimed at individuals, are the only way to tackle what has become, in economic as well as in social terms, a very real crisis.

      "bodyText": "Whither Black Friday? America\u2019s annual post-turkey, pre-dawn retail bender is coming under pressure as bricks-and-mortar retailers suffer the encroachment of online competition and a sprawling pre-holiday sale season threatens the foundations of the country\u2019s pre-eminent consumer bacchanal. Sales shopping is far from dead. According to the National Retail Federation, 59% of consumers \u2013 an estimated 137.4 million \u2013 plan to shop over the holiday weekend. The numbers, which cover Thanksgiving Day, Black Friday and the weekend, include both in-store and online shopping and are up fractionally from 58.7% or 135.8 million people last year. But Black Friday\u2019s reign as retail\u2019s biggest day is coming to an end. While Thanksgiving and Black Friday are expected to rake in more digital dollars, Cyber Monday \u2013 officially 28 November \u2013 is forecast to be the largest sales day of the year, at $3.36bn, according to Adobe Digital Insights. And we are really talking about a sales shopping season now, not single big days. Cyber Monday, started as a marketing ploy to encourage online shopping, now really starts on Black Friday for many online retailers, and retail giant Walmart is kicking off a \u201cCyber Week\u201d at one second past midnight on Thanksgiving Day itself. Confused? You should be, says consumer psychologist Kit Yarrow. Black Friday is no longer the defined or defining retail event it once was. Black Friday \u201cbargains\u201d are planned promotional price adjustments mixed in with a couple of loss-leaders, Yarrow says, but the real bargains start with Cyber Monday and last through to the December holidays. And whereas Black Friday deals used to be restricted to a retailer\u2019s stores, those same deals are often now found simultaneously online. Taking a lead from Amazon, this year Walmart plans to up its sales offering from 8m items to more than 23m. And they\u2019ll be available 18 hours before Walmart\u2019s door-buster deals go on sale in stores at 6pm. \u201cBlack Friday lost its identity and oomph. It\u2019s overhyped and online shopping has stolen its thunder,\u201d Yarrow says. Part of the trend, says Yarrow, is that retailers and consumers are bargain-obsessed and started their sales soon after Halloween. At the same time, \u201cthe deals are pretty much the same as last year and really, how many big-screen TVs do we need?\u201d The National Retail Federation president, Matthew Shay, says retailers answered consumers\u2019 demand for promotions by offering Black Friday deals as soon as the day after Halloween. According to the NRF, half of all consumers have already started gift-shopping. \u201cThis time of year is about finding the right gifts while staying on budget,\u201d says Shay. While the shopping season is shifting, the number of consumers planning to shop remains staggering. The NRF survey found that 21% of weekend shoppers plan to shop on Thanksgiving Day, nearly the same as last year\u2019s 22%. But Black Friday will remain the busiest day of the holiday weekend with 74% planning to shop that day. The trend for shopping earlier in the season is being driven by millennials, with 86% of 18- to 24-year-olds and 78% of 25- to 34-year-olds planning to shop on Black Friday. For this group, online shopping on Thanksgiving is a holiday tradition and shopping remains a social experience, whether in-store or online with the aid of social media. \u201cIt\u2019s the only experiential moment retailers offer them during the holiday season that they can share with friends and family and then share it with the rest of the world on social media,\u201d says Ana Serafin Smith at the National Retail Federation. Counterintuitively, the key for retailers to get millennials into stores has been to boost their online presence, says Smith. Then the excitement of the sales retail experience \u2013 large crowds, new products and the opportunity to interact with other consumers who are interested in the same items \u2013 kicks in. \u201cThe biggest hurdle retailers had to go through was getting online. As they started to improve the quantity of products online to what they had in the store allowed them to connect because millennials love to do a lot of their research online and then walk into the store to purchase it. It reaffirms their decision that to spend, say $1,000 on a new Samsung TV, is the best decision for them,\u201d says Smith. Retailers have further learned to mix up the deals they offer online or in the stores to allow them to get traffic through both. \u201cThat way they can appeal to all the different types of modern consumers we have now,\u201d says Smith. Some only want to buy in store, others online, so retailers have learnt to incentivize both. \u201cThat\u2019s the retailers\u2019 way of showing that they\u2019re listening to their customers and paying attention to what they like and don\u2019t like.\u201d One thing in retailers\u2019 favor, retail analysts believe, is the end of the election season. According to HookLogic, e-commerce dropped 5% year-on-year the day before the election, 16% the day of the election itself, and 23% the day after. But in the period since, confidence has rebounded and with it shopping. By the Thursday after the election, e-commerce spending was up 24%. \u201cIt was a long, tough election,\u201d says Yarrow. \u201cNo matter if your candidate won or lost most seem to want a respite \u2013 even an escape. Add to that a relatively stable sense of personal economic security and I think it\u2019ll be a solid holiday shopping season.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "As the clock ticks down to Black Friday, aggressive promotions on everything from 4K TVs to tablet computers and winter coats could be the last hurrah for shoppers before price hikes in 2017. After bargain-hunting consumers went on the rampage on Black Friday in 2014, fighting in the aisles for cut-price widescreen televisions, last year it was a much tamer affair, as shoppers retreated to the safety of seeking the best bargains online. This year, there is likely to be more of a sense of going, going, gone on the high street\u2019s hottest deals, because retailers across the board are signalling that the weakness of sterling will push up prices in 2017. While just over half of businesses participating in Black Friday anticipate higher sales this year, fewer store chains are taking part, according to an industry poll by Barclays. \u201cThis suggests that parts of the industry may be starting to resist what some see as an unwelcome discounting event in the run-up to the all-important Christmas trading period,\u201d said Ian Gilmartin, Barclays\u2019 head of retail and wholesale. However, the Dixons Carphone chief executive, Sebastian James, remains bullish, confident that this Friday will be the retailer\u2019s biggest trading day for a fourth consecutive year, as it offers 3,500 products in the black tag sale event. \u201cIt\u2019s not profitable for other retailers, but it is for us,\u201d James said. \u201cWe get these amazing deals from manufacturers because we buy so much. For customers, it is a great day and we can still make money doing it.\u201d The Currys PC World owner expects to shift truckloads of household electronics, ranging from 50in Samsung 4K TVs and Microsoft Surface Pro tablets to American-style fridges and Dyson cordless vacuum cleaners, as shoppers increasingly use Black Friday to upgrade their domestic appliances, alongside buying gifts. A PricewaterhouseCoopers survey found that shoppers planning to bargain hunt this weekend had earmarked an average spend of \u00a3203, with electricals and technology top of their lists. This year\u2019s hot gadgets include bean-to-cup coffee machines and high-pressure steam irons. James said: \u201cThe difference between us and the supermarkets is we have offers running right through the range, [including on] a big OLED TV that would [normally] cost you \u00a33,000. We\u2019ll do a deal on that. We\u2019re not just selling cheap Chinese tellies.\u201d Suppliers including HP and LG have devoted several weeks to producing stock for the event. Looking further ahead, fashion retailer Next has said its clothing prices will rise by up to 5%. On Tuesday, John Roberts, the chief executive of the company behind electrical goods website AO, confirmed that suppliers were starting to charge more. Shoppers will feel the brunt of this in January, he said. Apple has pushed up the price of every computer in its range, while Microsoft and Dell have also signalled that price hikes are on the way. The Marmite standoff between Tesco and Unilever exposed high levels of tension in price negotiations. \u201cWe are having a lot of quite tense discussions about [price],\u201d said James. \u201cWe should. It\u2019s our job to make sure people get great prices. We\u2019re lucky because we are very big and those discussions are often quite productive. \u201cAll our products are made outside the UK and denominated in dollars or Chinese yuan. As a result, it is a mathematical certainty that we need more pounds to buy those same products, so it\u2019s how we manage that. \u201cAt every point in the range, prices inevitably are going to go up ... but you\u2019ll still be able to get a telly that is a lot better than the last one you had.\u201d While more than 80% of British shoppers bought a gadget during the 2015 Black Friday sales period, retail analysts at Verdict predict that canny shoppers will also be on the lookout for clothing deals this year. \u201cWe expect participation in this sector to grow this year, as retailers such as Next have forewarned of price increases,\u201dsaid Verdict\u2019s Zoe Mills. \u201cThere has been a lot of discussion about the impact of Brexit. I think shoppers are very aware that prices are going to rise and they see Black Friday as an opportunity to get something cheaper than in the new year.\u201d",

We\u2019re lucky because we are very big and those discussions are often quite productive.</p> <p>\u201cAll our products are made outside the UK and denominated in dollars or Chinese yuan. As a result, it is a mathematical certainty that we need more pounds to buy those same products, so it\u2019s how we manage that.</p> <p>\u201cAt every point in the range, prices inevitably are going to go up ... but you\u2019ll still be able to get a telly that is a lot better than the last one you had.\u201d</p> <p>While more than 80% of British shoppers bought a gadget during the 2015 Black Friday sales period, retail analysts at Verdict predict that canny shoppers will also be on the lookout for clothing deals this year.</p> <p>\u201cWe expect participation in this sector to grow this year, as retailers such as Next have forewarned of price increases,\u201dsaid Verdict\u2019s Zoe Mills. \u201cThere has been a lot of discussion about the impact of Brexit. I think shoppers are very aware that prices are going to rise and they see Black Friday as an opportunity to get something cheaper than in the new year.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "Adani, which is vying to build Australia\u2019s largest coalmine, has announced the site of a $200m solar farm near a central Queensland mining town. The Indian energy conglomerate plans to build a 100-200 MW solar plant on 600ha that was formerly part of the Rugby Run grazing property near Moranbah. Adani, India\u2019s largest solar generator, said on Thursday the Rugby Run solar farm would be \u201cone of the world\u2019s most advanced solar energy plants\u201d. The company\u2019s first solar foray in Australia has prompted rare praise from environmental groups, including one that has taken it on in court over its bitterly contested Carmichael coal project near Bowen. Peter McCallum, of Mackay Conservation Group, said on Monday the company\u2019s latest move would bring it far more widespread support. \u201cAdani is fundamentally an energy company, not a miner, and its expertise is shifting rapidly towards becoming a clean energy producer in India and now in Australia.\u201d Rugby Run is the first of a number of solar projects through which Adani plans to provide up to 1500MW in Australia within the next five years. Adani said: \u201cThe solar projects are part of Adani\u2019s balanced approach to power generation with coal-fired, solar and wind plants supporting the energy policies of the nations in which Adani operates.\u201d Anne Baker, the mayor of Isaac regional council, said the solar plant was an \u201cexciting\u201d development for a local government area that contains 24 of Queensland\u2019s operating coalmines and produces 63% of its saleable coal. \u201cIt\u2019s fantastic to see a project that will diversify our economy from its dominant mining base,\u201d she said. Adani said it would start building the Rugby Run plant in mid-2017 and finish within 12 months. The construction would create up to 350 jobs, while five fulltime staff would then operate the solar farm. Adani has applied to public utility Powerlink to connect the plant and feed into the state electricity network. The company has built 793MW of solar generating capacity in India to date, including one of the world\u2019s largest solar plants, a 648MW facility in the southern state of Tamil Nadu.",
