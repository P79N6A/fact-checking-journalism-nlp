      "bodyText": "British Gas is considering the introduction of \"Free Power Saturdays\" to try to counter widespread anger over surging energy bills and utility company profits. Centrica, which owns British Gas, on Wednesday reported a 9% increase in group profits, after gas consumption jumped 13% following last winter's record-breaking cold spell. It also refused to rule out a future price increase. Under Free Power Saturdays, pioneered by British Gas's North American business, customers would be encouraged to use energy-hungry electrical devices such as washing machines and tumble dryers at the weekend. The idea is to raise household usage at a time when industrial and commercial power demand slumps. Other tariff ideas under consideration include pricing gas on Saturdays and Sundays at half the level of weekdays. But any shift to day-by-day pricing would require households to have smart meters fitted. British Gas has already installed more than one million of the devices. Centrica's chief executive, Sam Laidlaw, told the Financial Times that free Saturdays could be introduced early next year, in a move the company hopes could ease the heavy criticism it has faced from consumers and politicians over its rising profits. Last year the prime minister pledged to force power companies to give every customer the cheapest possible deal rather than put them on to standard tariffs, but it later emerged that this could lead to one in five customers actually paying more. Laidlaw said cheaper weekend tariffs would benefit the environment: \"In addition to being good for customers, they [free power days] are good for carbon reduction by reducing peak power generation that is disproportionately higher in carbon dioxide emissions.\" Earlier, Centrica's chief financial officer, Nick Luff, had refused to rule out a further price rise, as he warned that British Gas is under pressure from the cost of government energy-saving schemes and volatile prices on the wholesale gas market. \"What I can do is assure you that we will keep our prices as low as we can,\" he said. \"It is in our interests to have competitive prices \u2013 we want to attract new customers \u2013 and if prices do have to go up we will delay that for as long as possible.\" Centrica, which raised prices by 6% last November, reported a 9% increase in profits to \u00a31.58bn for the first six months of the year. for its entire business spanning power generation and supply.

    "webTitle": "Funding for Lending leaves small businesses on hard rations", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "There were plenty of sceptics when the Bank of England launched its Funding for Lending scheme (FLS) a year ago. The doubters said it would not be the catalyst for investment to small and medium-sized companies and would not cut the Gordian knot that has seen bank lending to businesses fall quarter after quarter. And, on the evidence of the past 12 months, the sceptics were right. Threadneedle Street got quite sniffy when it was suggested that the FLS would be a bung to the high street banks benefiting only Britain's vociferous and overblown housing lobby? Not at all, the Old Lady demurred. This was a scheme that would help metal bashers as well as mortgage payers. When the initial data showed that there was no pick-up in SME lending, the Bank said patience was called for. Lending to the housing market would rise first, it said, with business lending responding with a lag. Well, the wait goes on. As predicted the cheap funds the commercial banks have been able to obtain from the Bank of England have boosted the housing market while lending to SMEs continues to languish. The FLS, now supported by George Osborne's Help to Buy subsidies, is well on its way to generating Britain's next housing market bubble, while SMEs remain on hard rations. So much for rebalancing the economy. So much for breaking the UK's dependency on debt. Here's what Richard Sexton, director of e.surv chartered surveyors, has to say about the scheme: \"Funding for Lending has given the mortgage market some real get up and go. And that's in stark comparison to its impact on SME lending, which is still bumping along the bottom. Compared to last year, house purchase lending is 23% higher. It's true that the funding source has allowed banks to slash interest rates, and savers have been punished. But there has been a real payoff. \"Loans to high LTV [loan-to-value] borrowers are now at a four-and-a-half-year high. More first-time buyers than ever are able to access house purchase loans. Rates have dropped and banks are more willing to lend to first-time buyers in the knowledge they have a cushion of cheap credit to fall back on should some of those loans go pear-shaped.\" Well, quite. Apart from the flatlining business lending, the punishment meted out to savers, the fact that first-time buyers are taking on more debt than may be advisable, and the security the Bank of England is providing to lenders for duff loans that go pear-shaped, what's not to like? Not a lot, clearly, if you are a government desperate to generate a feelgood factor between now and the election in 2015.

      "body": "<p>There were plenty of sceptics when the Bank of England launched its Funding for Lending scheme (FLS) a year ago. The doubters said it would not be the catalyst for investment to small and medium-sized companies and would not cut the Gordian knot that has seen bank lending to businesses fall quarter after quarter. And, on the evidence of the past 12 months, the sceptics were right.</p> <p>Threadneedle Street got quite sniffy when it was suggested that the FLS would be a bung to the high street banks benefiting only Britain's vociferous and overblown housing lobby? Not at all, the Old Lady demurred. This was a scheme that would help metal bashers as well as mortgage payers.</p> <p>When the initial data showed that there was no pick-up in SME lending, the Bank said patience was called for. Lending to the housing market would rise first, it said, with business lending responding with a lag.</p> <p>Well, the wait goes on. As predicted the cheap funds the commercial banks have been able to obtain from the Bank of England have boosted the housing market while lending to SMEs continues to languish. The FLS, now supported by George Osborne's Help to Buy subsidies, is well on its way to generating Britain's next housing market bubble, while SMEs remain on hard rations. So much for rebalancing the economy. So much for breaking the UK's dependency on debt.</p> <p>Here's what Richard Sexton, director of e.surv chartered surveyors, has to say about the scheme: \"Funding for Lending has given the mortgage market some real get up and go. And that's in stark comparison to its impact on SME lending, which is still bumping along the bottom. Compared to last year, house purchase lending is 23% higher. It's true that the funding source has allowed banks to slash interest rates, and savers have been punished. But there has been a real payoff.</p> <p>\"Loans to high LTV [loan-to-value] borrowers are now at a four-and-a-half-year high. More first-time buyers than ever are able to access house purchase loans. Rates have dropped and banks are more willing to lend to first-time buyers in the knowledge they have a cushion of cheap credit to fall back on should some of those loans go pear-shaped.\"</p> <p>Well, quite. Apart from the flatlining business lending, the punishment meted out to savers, the fact that first-time buyers are taking on more debt than may be advisable, and the security the Bank of England is providing to lenders for duff loans that go pear-shaped, what's not to like?</p> <p>Not a lot, clearly, if you are a government desperate to generate a feelgood factor between now and the election in 2015. Nothing at all if you are a surveyor or a mortgage broker happy to see a steady stream of first-time buyers come through the door.</p> <p>But quite a lot if you think that house prices are already way too high, that far too much of Britain's fixed investment goes into bricks and mortar, and that the UK's dismal economic history of the past four decades can be summed up by the inevitability of housing bust following housing boom.</p> <p>Sexton says, perfectly accurately, that FLS has been like a \"course of steroids\" for the mortgage market. That, sadly, is precisely the problem with it.</p>",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Parliament is to open a new front in the corporation tax war by asking auditors to lift the lid on the tax breaks exploited by multinationals in sectors ranging from the internet to infrastructure. Margaret Hodge, whose public accounts committee of MPs has already tackled Google, Amazon and Starbucks, said the public was being \"conned\" by the government about the amount that mobile phone networks in particular contribute to the public purse. She is asking government accountants to investigate whether the vast array of reliefs offered by the taxman are being misused. Her comments were in response to a Guardian investigation published on Wednesday, which reveals that three of the UK's four networks are paying little or no corporation tax while sharing billions in dividends, management fees and royalties with their multinational owners. By making full use of the many legal tax discounts available for items ranging from investment in infrastructure to interest payments on loans, mobile companies are able to pay rich rewards to executives and shareholders while making little or no corporation tax contribution to the public purse. Accounts show that Everything Everywhere (EE), Britain's largest mobile phone network, has handed over \u00a33bn in cash and fees to its French and German parent companies, but paid no corporation tax in the UK, since it was created through a merger three years ago. EE says its accounts are transparent and it takes a responsible approach. Mobile companies argue that they contribute in other ways, by investing in British infrastructure and spending billions in government auctions of spectrum \u2013 the airwaves needed to carry mobile signals. However, a trawl through Vodafone's books shows it is using tax breaks to reclaim half of the \u00a36.2bn it spent at the 3G mobile internet spectrum auction in 2000. This suggests the government is actually giving back to private companies a large portion of the headline-grabbing \u00a322.5bn raised from what was the biggest ever sale of a UK public asset. Such are the complexities of the tax system that the extent to which networks have been able to claim back money from the Treasury is only now coming to light. Since Orange and T-Mobile merged to form EE, Britain's four network operators have generated \u00a358bn in revenues, with underlying profits of \u00a312bn. While the average corporation tax rate of 25% would in principle force a company to share a quarter of its profits with the Treasury, networks have paid far less than that. Taken as a whole, the contribution of all four networks to the exchequer is under \u00a31bn in the past three years, with most of that sum coming from just one company, O2. In the period, O2 has paid \u00a3669m in tax, but this is still a fraction of the \u00a32.45bn passed to its Spanish parent company Telef\u00f3nica in dividends. Three, owned by the Hong Kong conglomerate Hutchison Whampoa, is loss-making and has paid no tax. Vodafone has ceded just \u00a3156m in UK corporation tax, but paid \u00a36.7bn to other countries during the past three years. \"Never has there been a better case for more transparency from publicly quoted companies,\" said Hodge. \"We are looking at this issue of tax relief and I would like this case included in our investigation. We appear to have been conned [by the government] about the amount of money we've really secured for the sale of spectrum. \"We wanted investment in communications technology, from which these companies make a very good return, and we ended up subsidising them. \"If subsidy is justified it has to be transparent. What is unacceptable is devious ways in which government pretends that it is being commercial, and in reality is giving away taxpayers' money.\" Hodge said she would raise the issue of mobile networks with the National Audit Office, which monitors how public money is spent. The NAO is currently deciding the scope of an investigation into tax relief. MPs are keen to see scrutiny of film tax breaks, loopholes exploited by wealthy individuals, and the tax affairs of companies in the water, gas and electricity sectors. Last year, an Observer investigation found Thames Water and Anglian Water had paid no corporation tax in the year to March 2012 while spending millions on dividends to shareholders. Mobile networks are among the UK's most cash-rich businesses. With the arrival of fast 4G internet, and with more people owning smartphones and tablets, the amount consumers spend with networks is set to rise steeply. Vodafone is one of the top two dividend payers in the FTSE 100, and its chief executive earned \u00a311m last year. But these riches do not translate into corporation tax. This is because British law allows relief equal to around a quarter of the money spent on items including buying spectrum, installing equipment such as masts, and paying any interest on company debt. Although a company may have cash in the bank, it can report a taxable loss on paper. The Conservative MP Charlie Elphicke, a urged the telecoms regulator Ofcom to review the spectrum licences of companies not paying their fair share. \"They take our money but won't contribute,\" said Elphicke. He said: \"The something-for-nothing culture seems alive and well in the mobile phone industry. Ofcom needs to consider whether companies behaving in this way are fit and proper to hold a licence in the UK.\" A spokesman said: \"Ofcom's role is to ensure that spectrum is used efficiently to benefit consumers. We do not have any oversight of tax issues.\" Paul Farrelly, the culture select committee member and Labour MP, said: \"It is time for HMRC to get tough across the board and question arrangements which allow so much to be sent by multinationals offshore, while they are paying little or no tax on their UK operations. These are huge businesses and it's time they paid their fair share into the public purse.\" Mobile networks maintain that they act within the law, and that they are rightly benefiting from tax breaks that were designed to encourage investment in critical national infrastructure \u2013 the communication networks Britain needs to join the global digital economy. EE said: \"EE has transparent financial accounts and a responsible approach to tax, and strongly contests any suggestion of improper tax conduct. Over the last 13 years, EE has invested more than \u00a316bn building a 21st-century digital infrastructure for Britain. This includes \u00a39bn contributed directly to the UK Treasury for the use of mobile airwaves, an amount 10 times more than any corporate tax that EE would have otherwise paid to date had it not deducted the cost of the airwaves like any other business asset.\" Vodafone said it had made just over \u00a310bn in cash since 2000, and paid \u00a37.5bn of that to the exchequer in the 3G sale and this year's 4G spectrum auction. A spokesman said: \"Our infrastructure investment in building networks across the UK helps stimulate economic growth and benefits consumers and businesses alike.\" O2 said: \"We make a profit in the UK and pay corporation tax on that profit, making a significant contribution to Britain's economy.\" Three UK said: \"In common with all UK-based businesses we are able to offset historic losses against future profits.\"",

The president heatedly defended Summers against critics on Wednesday, \"reacting emotionally\" and deriding news outlets including the Huffington Post for making Summers \"a progressive whipping boy.\" He asked vocal Senate Democrats to give Summers \"a fair shake\" according to a report in the Financial Times. The president also threw another name into the mix: former Fed vice chair Don Kohn. Obama said people \"would have to slice the salami very thin\" to find the differences between the three candidates.",

      "bodyText": "A little-known New Zealander appears poised to take on one of the highest profile roles in UK banking by becoming chief executive of the bailed-out Royal Bank of Scotland. Ross McEwan, who joined the 81%-taxpayer-owned bank last year as head of its retail arm, has been regarded as the leading internal candidate since Stephen Hester suddenly quit in June. After a number of external candidates were said to have rejected approaches by the bailed-out bank, he was regarded as the most likely to succeed Hester and the Financial Times reported that RBS was in talks with regulators at the Bank of England about securing approval for his appointment. RBS would not comment but McEwan's appointment could be announced as soon as today \u2013 when its bailed-out rival, Lloyds Banking Group, is expected to publish results that will pave the way for the government to sell off part of its 39% stake \u2013 or more likely when RBS is due to publish its first-half results. All top jobs need the approval of the Bank of England's regulatory arm, the Prudential Regulation Authority. Assuming the watchdog approves his appointment, the expert in retail banking will be seen as a contrast to Hester, an investment banker who earned a reputation as a corporate restructuring specialist. Hired by Hester last year to run RBS' retail bank, which includes NatWest, McEwan has already acclimatised himself to the bank, which paid \u00a33m to buy him out of share awards he was due from his previous employer, Commonwealth Bank of Australia, before he quit to join RBS. This buyout from his last employer may help RBS avoid any fresh row over his pay deal, while the appointment of an insider could head off any political criticism over the kind of pay package that could have been demanded by an external recruit. The 56-year-old had lost out on the top job at the Commonwealth Bank when he was poached by RBS last summer and since then he is said to have tried to visit five RBS branches a week. While he will need to hone his political antennae as he takes on a role that has more interaction between Westminster and the City than any other, he may also need diplomacy to handle colleagues who were also fighting for the top job, as the bank prepares to undergo yet another wave of restructuring five years after it was rescued with \u00a345bn of taxpayer cash. The investment bank Rothschild is currently considering the case for the government over whether to carve a \"bad bank\" out of RBS to leave a good bank that could be privatised more easily. He arrived in the aftermath of the computer breakdown in June 2012 that left millions of RBS and NatWest customers unable to access their accounts for more than week. He immediately began to talk about spending \u00a3700m to focus on customer service and discussing the prospect of rejigging the branch network to shift the emphasis from traditional locations to newer sites in railway stations and shopping centres. In May he admitted 1,400 jobs would go over the next two years from centralised operations, which employed 3,600 staff, including the head office in Gogarburn on the outskirts of Edinburgh. Although a banker for more than a decade, McEwan started his career in life insurance \u2013 he was chief executive of National Mutual Life Association of Australia/Axa New Zealand and held a senior role at the stockbroking outfit First NZ Capital Securities. Married with two grown-up children, he lists water-skiing and cycling among his interests outside work.",

    "webTitle": "Funding for Lending a year on: success for mortgage market, experts say", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "George Osborne's Funding for Lending Scheme (FLS), introduced a year ago on 1 August has been a \"significant factor\" in the recovery of the housing market but has failed to increase lending to businesses, according to experts who have monitored the impact of the initiative. The scheme, operated by the Bank of England, offers cheap loans to banks and building societies which they are supposed to pass on to consumers and businesses. The cost of using it depends on how much is lent, with institutions paying lower rates if they increase the amount they advance. It was originally designed to last 18 months, until February 2014, but has now been extended to January 2015. By the end of June this year, 41 financial institutions had signed up to the scheme, although not all had drawn down any money. A total of \u00a316.4bn in loans was outstanding, with Barclays holding the biggest tranche, at \u00a36bn. However, the signs of success seem to be concentrated in the mortgage market, where approvals for new loans are up by a third year on year and lenders have been battling to offer record low rates. Brokers suggest that it has even made \u00a31m-plus mortgages easier to get, as private banks who have signed up to the scheme are waving their traditional requirements that would-be borrowers shift funds to them in order to secure a loan. Howard Archer, chief UK economist at IHS Global Insight, said: \"It has helped to bring down bank funding costs, thereby underpinning a drop in some mortgage rates and lending rates to households and some businesses. It has clearly helped to lift mortgage availability and, to a lesser extent, unsecured credit to consumers.\" Archer said he believed FLS had been \"a significant factor in improved housing market activity and firming prices\", although higher levels of consumer confidence and employment had also been key. The Council of Mortgage Lenders (CML) said it could not quantify the impact of the scheme on lending levels or mortgage rates, but a spokesman said: \"It is clear that it has improved both the availability and pricing of credit.\" The CML said there were concerns about what might happen when the scheme ends in 2015, as any stimulus that suddenly stops risks a rush to beat the deadline and skews lending as a result. Archer said what happens at that point would depend on the state of the economy. \"If it is looking fundamentally sound, then I think banks will be more prepared to lend as they will see it as less risky. However, if the economy looks ropey, appetite to lend will likely be limited,\" he said. Launching the scheme a year ago, the chancellor said he expected that banks then offering loans through the National Loan Guarantee Scheme (NLGS) would eventually switch to FLS. \"The more generous FLS has officially opened for business and will in time effectively take over from the NLGS, delivering credit easing to the whole economy,\" he predicted. However figures from the Bank of England show net lending to non-financial firms dropped by \u00a31.3bn in June, following similar falls in May and April. Loans to small and medium-sized businesses were up, but only for the third time since the Bank started publishing data in May 2011. John Allan, the national chairman of the Federation of Small Businesses, said the main high street banks had not increased the amount of finance they were offering to business. \"Our research has shown credit is cheaper but that many firms are still struggling to access finance, with four in 10 firms refused loans in the second quarter of 2013,\" he said. Labour shadow business secretary Chuka Umunna said the scheme had so far failed \"successful profitable businesses who have been unable to get credit from the banks\", but he hoped that changes allowing alternative finance providers to access the money would help. \"The main transmission method has been the very high street banks that have proved to be such an obstacle to lending ... Hopefully the changes that have been made will render it more successful in the second year.\" He added that more needed to be done to change a situation where \"lending to 5m businesses is dominated by five banks\". The scheme has been bad news for one set of consumers: savers. They have seen interest rates tumble as banks and building societies no longer need to raise retail deposits. Bank of England figures show that rates on instant access cash Isas have halved over the past 12 months, while average rates on two-year fixed-rate savings bonds have plummeted from 3.17% to 1.72%. .",

If shareholders approve the deal, the new company will have a combined UK workforce of more than 4,600 and a global staff of 156,000.

      "bodyText": "Engineering firm Invensys has become the latest British company to fall to a foreign rival after agreeing to a \u00a33.4bn takeover by France's Schneider Electric. London-based Invensys, which develops computer systems for refineries, chemical and nuclear plants, employs more than 1,100 people in the UK \u2013 around 6% of its workforce. If shareholders approve the deal, the new company will have a combined UK workforce of more than 4,600 and a global staff of 156,000. But Schneider is warning of possible job losses as it aims to save \u20ac140m (\u00a3122m) a year. The French group sees potential to cut costs in overlapping corporate and support functions, and signalled it could offload non-core divisions within Invensys, including its appliance arm, which makes controls for washing machines.

Here's some instant reaction, via the Reuters terminal:</p> <h2>CHRISTIAN SCHULZ, BERENBERG BANK:</h2> <div> The German labour market is strong. The key to look at is not unemployment but employment which has been rising all along and even more important is the core employment - those jobs liable to social security contributions. These have been rising faster than overall employment so companies have been creating jobs all along but they've just not been able to find the required skills in the pool of unemployed. </div> <div> Unemployment is so low that the remaining pool doesn't seem to have the necessary qualifications. </div> <div> The second successive fall in unemployment shows there's still room for it to fall further - it can still fall further slowly and that's good for public finances and also consumption because it increases income and security so the disappointing retail sales data this morning will remain a blip and consumption should be a growth driver this year. </div> <div> &#xa0; </div> <h2>STEFFEN SCHILBE, HSBC TRINKAUS:</h2> <div> This is a positive surprise. The dip that we saw between March and May is being ironed out. The labour market is in a solid position. The early indicators have improved recently. Employment will probably increase. It's not unusual that the momentum is not that great given its high level. </div> <div> This is positive for the domestic economy, especially for private consumption.

Goodnight! GW Europe's stock markets just closed for the day, with decent gains in London, losses in Spain and Italy, and little change in Germany and France: Here's the closing prices: FTSE 100: up 50 points at 6621, + 0.76% German DAX: up 4 points at 8275, +0.06 French CAC: up 6 points at 3992, + 0.15% Spanish IBEX: down 23 points at 8433, - 0.27% Italian FTSE MIB: down 60 points at 16,482, -0.37% In the financial markets, the Dow Jones industrial average has hit a new all-time intraday high following today's US GDP data, which showed stronger than expected growth in the last three months. The Dow is currently up 81 points at 15602, a gain of 0.5%, on track for its highest ever close. There's also a rally in London, where the FTSE 100 has jumped 1% (closing prices to follow....) US debt, though, has weakened in value, pushing up bond yields. Traders are calculating that the GDP data will encourage the Federal Reserve to start the process of 'tapering' (or slowing) its bond-buying stimulus package this autumn. But Katie Evans of the Centre for Economics and Business Research (CEBR), doesn't think the situation has really changed: Although the economy is undoubtedly strengthening, unemployment has fallen only slightly in recent months, and the central bank has made it clear that labour markets must show substantial improvement before the programme is wound down. While the Fed is likely to express satisfaction with today\u2019s figures in its statement this evening, we do not expect today\u2019s data to inspire a sudden change in policy. Hopes of a verdict tonight in the Berlusconi case continue to fade... In Spain, prime minister Mariano Rajoy is getting ready to answer questions in parliament tomorrow over the illegal payments scandal consuming his party. From Madrid, Stephen Burgen writes: After seven months of ducking and diving, Spain's prime minister, Mariano Rajoy, will on Thursday answer questions in parliament about allegations that he and his party received illegal payments from big business in return for favourable treatment. The alleged Partido Popular slush fund was first uncovered in 2009, but Rajoy was not implicated directly until this January when the newspaper El Pa\u00eds revealed handwritten records covering illegal monthly cash payments to senior politicians, including a total of \u20ac250,000 to him. The ledgers were written by Luis B\u00e1rcenas, the party treasurer for a period of 20 years. According to B\u00e1rcenas, senior party figures were paid an \"extra salary\" ranging from \u20ac5,000 to \u20ac15,000 in cash each month. Government ministers are not permitted to receive any other income apart from their government salary. B\u00e1rcenas is in prison on remand having been declared a flight risk after it was revealed that he had \u20ac47m kept in Swiss bank accounts.

Back in Italy, Silvio Berlusconi's defence lawyers have begun presenting their case at the Rome Supreme Court, in their final bid to get his conviction for tax fraud overturned. They have around 50 separate objection - so they're likely to take the rest of the day, meaning a decision isn't expected until Thursday. Here's a flavour of Reuters' last update from Rome: Lawyers for Silvio Berlusconi asked the supreme court on Wednesday to throw out a tax fraud conviction against the former prime minister in a case that may decide not only his future but that of Italy's fragile coalition government. The Court of Cassation was hearing defence arguments from both Berlusconi's lawyers and those for three others convicted by two lower courts of the fraudulent purchase of broadcasting rights by his Mediaset MS.MI television empire. A verdict by the five judges is unlikely before Thursday. Berlusconi's chief counsel, Franco Coppi, said he and another lawyer for the media mogul expected to speak for five hours in an afternoon session beginning at 3.30 p.m. (1330 GMT). That would suggest the session will close at 7.30pm BST tonight... Another fillip for America -- its private sector created more jobs than expected last month. The ADP private sector payroll rose by 200,000 in July, beating June's 198,000 increase and ahead of forecasts of a 175,000 rise. That included around 82,000 new jobs in small firms (CNN has a round-up here). Some early reaction to the US GDP data: A splurge of US economic data has shown that America's GDP increased by more than expected in the last three months, and during 2012. The US Commerce Department reported annual GDP growth of 1.7% between April and June, or just over 0.4% on a quarterly basis. It also downgraded growth in Q1 to 1.1% on an annual basis, from 1.8%. Last year was also a better year for America, it appears, with GDP revised upwards to +2.8%, from +2.2%. And with historic data dating back to 1929 being revised, there's plenty for economists to get their teeth and calculators into: This tweet shows the key section of the latest IMF report, outlining Greece's funding gap: The International Monetary Fund has warned that an \u20ac11bn shortfall has opened up in Greece's bailout programme, as Brazil reveals that eleven Latin American countries declined to support handing Athens its latest aid tranche. In a new quarterly assessment of the Greek programme, the IMF was much less optimistic about Greece's situation than its Troika partners. The funding gap \u2013 which has been rumoured for some time \u2013 opens up in 2014 and worsens in 2015. The IMF wants to see eurozone governments to provide around \u20ac5bn of debt relief soon, to protect Athens from any economic shocks that will make its situation worse. The Financial Times's Peter Spiegel has the details: Eurozone governments may be forced to write-off even bigger chunks of their bailout loans to Athens unless the Greek economy begins to turn round, the IMF said in its most clear call yet for eurozone governments to accept big losses on their Greek aid. If investors are not persuaded that the policy for dealing with the debt problem is credible, investment and growth will be unlikely to recover as programmed,\u201d the IMF said in the 195-page report. \u201cShould debt sustainability concerns prove to be weighing on investor sentiments even with the framework for debt relief now in place, European partners should consider providing relief that would entail a faster reduction in debt than currently programmed.\u201d And with most Greek debt in public hands, this reopens the issue of eurozone governments facing actual losses. Here's the full story on the FT. At the same time...Paulo Nogueira Batista, Brazil's executive director at the IMF, has revealed that eleven Latin American countries abstained on this month's vote to give Greece's its next aid payment, worth \u20ac1.7bn. Batista was blunt about Greece's failings over implementing its reform programme: Recent developments in Greece confirm some of our worst fears... Implementation has been unsatisfactory in almost all areas; growth and debt sustainability assumptions continue to be over-optimistic. Batista also cited the IMF's own concerns about Greece (see above), saying the Fund was close to admitting that Greece might default on its bailout loans. More details on Reuters: Brazil refused to back new IMF aid for Greece, says billions at risk There has been another drop in Irish unemployment today, with 3,200 fewer people claiming the dole in July. From Dublin, Henry McDonald reports: According to the Republic's Central Statistics Office this is the 13th consecutive month of decline in the jobless total. The CSO says that unemployment is now 4% lower in July 2013 compared to last summer. But is worth noting that around 14% of the Irish workforce is still on the dole with the construction and retail sectors still suffering from the collapse of the Celtic Tiger economy. The IMF's mission chief to Cyprus, Delia Velculescu, is speaking on a conference call now to mark the end of the review mission (see 12.27pm). Velculescu told reporters that vigilance is required because of the uncertainties ahead, but reiterated that Cyprus is meeting its targets: We found the programme to be on track, authorities made good progress towards meeting their objectives. But on Twitter, economists and fund managers aren't convinced - especially given the soaring unemployment in Cyprus: Sorry about my face appearing so many times with those tweets (once is quite enough - Ed). Just in -- the European Commission, ECB and IMF have published the results of their First Review Mission to Cyprus. The top-line conclusion of the Troika's officials is that the Cypriot bailout programme is on track, with the Nicosia government hitting the targets set in the rescue agree in March. However, they also admitted that the Cyprus labour market has deteriorated more than they expected. Here's the key section: The short-run economic outlook remains difficult and subject to considerable uncertainty. Recent indicators support the program\u2019s projections of a contraction in output of about 13 percent cumulatively during 2013-14. Encouragingly, confidence indicators have improved somewhat from the lows hit in April. But the labor market has weakened more than anticipated, and unemployment has continued to rise. Growth is expected to recover modestly starting in 2015, driven by non-financial services. Today's unemployment data confirms that Cyprus's labour market certainly has worsened. The jobless rate hit 17.3% in June, up from 16.5% in May. A year ago, the rate was 11.7%. The full statement is online here: It explains that Cyprus will get its next bailout payment in September, if the Eurogroup and the Executive Board of the IMF agree with the report's findings. No sign of celebrations in Brussels that the number of people out of work in the eurozone fell by 24,000 in June (see 10.11am). European Commission spokesman Dennis Abbott said unemployment in Europe was \"horrendously high\", and that member states need to implement structural reforms to make themselves more competitive. Economists are welcoming today's fall in unemployment, but warn that Europe is far from fixed and faces social unrest unless the youth jobless crisis is addressed. Here's a round-up: Timo del Carpio, European economist at RBC Capital Markets: While the latest data are far from suggesting a quick turnaround, the stabilization provides some relief from the relentless rise in the number of unemployed to date. Andrea Broughton, Principal Research Fellow at the Institute for Employment Studies: The EU still has significant labour market issues to contend with, such as the wide discrepancy between the labour market performance of individual Member States, essentially along a north/south divide. \u201cThere is also the perpetual headache of youth unemployment, which is still increasing, although possibly more slowly than in recent months. A situation in which almost a quarter of young people who are available for work cannot find a job is storing up significant social and economic problems for the future. EU policymakers are attempting to address the crisis in youth unemployment with schemes such as the Youth Guarantee. The EU is also seeking to highlight and disseminate good practice in terms of training and work experience for young people, particularly in countries such as Germany, Austria and the Netherlands. Jonathan Loynes, chief European economist at Capital Economics: The huge divergences between countries \u2013 from 4.6% in Austria to 26.3% in Spain - are a powerful reminder of the still enormous economic imbalances inside the currency union. The huge divergences between countries \u2013 from 4.6% in Austria to 26.3% in Spain - are a powerful reminder of the still enormous economic imbalances inside the currency union. - See more at: http://www.cityam.com/blog/eu-spokesman-says-eurozone-unemployment-horrendously-high#sthash.MaCQiqAY.dpuf Tomas Holinka, economist at Moody's Analytics: Signs that the euro area is emerging from recession and accelerated inflation have eased pressure on the ECB to cut rates. Over in Italy, the country's top judges are considering Silvio Berlusconi's appeal against a tax fraud conviction that could see him barred from politics. The former PM's supporters are out in force, as this picture of a man holding a placard calling for \"Pity for Berlusconi and Italians, now or never\" shows: A verdict is expected tonight or tomorrow. There are now three possible scenarios: \u2022 Berlusconi is fully acquitted. Thus, overturning a jail sentence and ban from public office (originally five years, but the prosecution now suggests three would be appropriate). \u2022 The original verdict is overturned. Berlusconi would be retried (although Italy's statute of limitations could then see the case fold) \u2022 The conviction is upheld. That would mean Italian MPs would have to confirm it - prompting a political crisis that could tear the coalition apart. On the other hand, a three-year ban from public office could still mean Berlusconi was free to run in the next election, if prime minister Letta can last that long: And here's more analysis from Alberto Nardelli: Silvio Berlusconi Mediaset verdict - possible scenarios The first drop in the eurozone unemployment total since April 2011 is a welcome sign that the region's economy may be bottoming out. But the situation remains very difficult. At 12.1%, the eurozone jobless rate compares unfavourably to the US (7.6%), or Japan (3.9%). Howard Archer, chief economist at IHS Global Insight, fears that unemployment will rise again over the next year -- particularly as public sector workforces are cut as austerity programmes grind on. Archer wrote: June\u2019s dip in unemployment is likely a reflection of recent increased signs that Eurozone economic activity has stabilized, and it fuels hopes that the Eurozone can eke out marginal growth over the second half. The July European Commission survey showed that consumers were becoming less worried about job prospects, which may encourage them to gradually step up their spending. Even so, we doubt that June marks a decisive turnaround in Eurozone labour markets and we suspect that unemployment will trend modestly higher over the coming month.While Eurozone GDP likely stopped contracting in the second quarter after a record six quarters of decline, economic activity is likely to remain too weak through 2013, and very possibly during the early months of 2014, to prevent unemployment from rising further. Eurostat also reported that inflation in the eurozone was stable this month, at 1.6%. Details here (pdf). This graph shows how eurozone unemployment has finally stopped rising, and is actually falling in the EU (see 10am onwards): Southern Europe still has a youth unemployment crisis on its hands. There are now 23.9% of under 25s out of work in the eurozone, up from 23.8% in May. Across the EU, the rate also rose, to 23.2% from 23.1% a month ago. The lowest rates were recorded in Germany (7.5%), Austria (9.3%) , the Netherlands (11.0%) and Malta (11.2%), and the highest in Greece (58.7% in April 2013) and Spain (56.1%). Eurostat reported that there are now 5.512m young persons unemployed in the EU27, of whom 3.526m live in the euro area. This looks like the first drop in eurozone unemployment in more than two years: This is a moment. Eurostat reports that there was a small drop in unemployment in both the eurozone and the EU during June. Compared with May 2013, the number of persons unemployed decreased by 32 000 in the EU27 and by 24 000 in the euro area. Compared with June 2012, unemployment rose by 1.080 million in the EU27 and by 1.129 million in the euro area. That 24k drop in eurozone unemployment wasn't enough to nudge the jobless rate below the 12.1% mark, though, but it's still an encouraging development. But the broad picture, though is that there are an estimated 26.424 million men and women out of work in the European Union, and 19.266 million were in the euro area. The unemployment rate in the European Union is down slightly in June, to 10.9% from 11% in May. You can see the new jobs data on Eurostat's web site (pdf). Breaking: The eurozone unemployment rate has been recorded at 12.1% for June. Eurostat has also revised down last month's slightly, to a rate of 12.1%. So the situation is marginally less bleak than we thought. More to follow.... Now here's a surprise... Italy's seasonally adjusted jobless rate has fallen, to 12.1% in June. That's a small but welcome improvement on last month's record high of 12.2%, and rather better than the 12.3% which analysts were braced for. But the data also showed a new deterioration in the youth jobless rate, which is now running at 39.1%. And Italy's chronically low employment rate (which measures participation in the workforce) dipped again, to 55.8% (from 55.9% last month). On that German jobs data...if you strip out seasonal factors, the raw jobless total rose by 49,000 - more on AP here. The German jobless data for July has been released, and shows an unexpected 7,000 drop in the (seasonally adjusted) unemployment total. That brings the total number of people out of work in Germany to 2.934m and leaves the jobless rate at 6.8%, close to its lowest since reunification. Analysts say the data shows the underlying strength of the German economy, despite this morning's drop in retail sales. Here's some instant reaction, via the Reuters terminal: CHRISTIAN SCHULZ, BERENBERG BANK: The German labour market is strong. The key to look at is not unemployment but employment which has been rising all along and even more important is the core employment - those jobs liable to social security contributions. These have been rising faster than overall employment so companies have been creating jobs all along but they've just not been able to find the required skills in the pool of unemployed. Unemployment is so low that the remaining pool doesn't seem to have the necessary qualifications. The second successive fall in unemployment shows there's still room for it to fall further - it can still fall further slowly and that's good for public finances and also consumption because it increases income and security so the disappointing retail sales data this morning will remain a blip and consumption should be a growth driver this year. STEFFEN SCHILBE, HSBC TRINKAUS: This is a positive surprise. The dip that we saw between March and May is being ironed out. The labour market is in a solid position. The early indicators have improved recently. Employment will probably increase. It's not unusual that the momentum is not that great given its high level. This is positive for the domestic economy, especially for private consumption. That will be increasingly significant in a global climate that is not very straightforward. The latest retail sales figures from Spain and Germany are disappointing. A chilling reminder that consumers are suffering badly, for all the optimism that the eurozone recession is coming to an end. German retail sales fell by 1.5% month-on-month in June, and were down 2.8% on a year-on-year basis- led by a drop in spending on food, drink and tobacco And in Spain, retail sales have now shrunk for three full years. They declined by 0.7% last month, which means a 5.1% year-on-year decline last month. We learned yesterday that Spanish GDP fell by 0.1% in the last quarter -- shrinking retail sales don't suggest consumers will drag the economy to growth. Fingers crossed for exports.... The Greek government is urging its departments to speed up the process of laying off staff, in a bid to meet the targets set by its lenders. Administrative reform minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis, the man tasked with slashing 15,000 civil servants from the payroll by the end of 2014, has written to ministries to tell them to accelerate disciplinary processes to get errant staff out of the door. Kathimerini, the Greek newspaper, reports: The missive asks for disciplinary hearings, which often drag on for many months, to be wrapped up in two to four months. The government wants to remove from the public payroll any civil servants found guilty of committing offenses. At the end of June, 1,920 cases, including appeals, were being examined by disciplinary panels. Mitsotakis is also sending 'inspectors' into government departments, in an effort to root out employees guilty of misconduct. He denied that staff would be hounded out of office, saying that civil servants who don't turn up for work or who invented fictitious degrees are being targeted. Mitsotakis told ANT1 TV: Those who possess genuine skills have nothing to fear. In the currency markets, sterling has hit a four and a half-month low against the euro \u2013 falling to \u20ac1.146. That comes ahead of tomorrow's central bank meetings -- recent encouraging eurozone data makes it less likely that the European Central Bank will ease monetary policy. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the latest events across the eurozone, the financial markets and the global economy. Hopes that the eurozone economy is turning a corner will be tested today with the latest unemployment figures from across Europe. Analysts fear another dose of bad news at 10am BST, with the euro jobless rate stuck at its current record high of 12.2%, and youth unemployment rates in weaker countries also at unprecedented rates. There were more than 19 million people out of work across the euro area at the last count, putting the talk of rising confidence and an end to the recession into perspective. The jobless data comes on a reasonably busy day for economic news -- with eurozone inflation also published at 10am BST. We then get the first estimate of US GDP for the second quarter of the year at 1.30pm, which is expected to show that growth in the world's largest economy slowed in the last three months. Over in Italy, Silvio Berlusconi's final appeal against his conviction, jail term and ban from public office continues. Last night, the prosecutor in the case proposed cutting that ban from five years to three (as covered in yesterday's blog). While in Greece, the push to meet its bailout targets and cut public sector jobs continues (more on this shortly). I'll be tracking all the developments through the day...",

    "webTitle": "British Gas owner won't rule out price hike after latest rise in profits", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Consumer groups are urging British Gas to freeze energy bills this winter, after the company's owner Centrica reported a rise in profits following last winter's record-breaking chill and refused to rule out a price hike. Centrica's chief financial officer Nick Luff would not rule out a price rise as he warned that British Gas is under pressure from environmental levies and volatile prices on the wholesale gas market. \"What I can do is assure you that we will keep our prices as low as we can. It is in our interests to have competitive prices, we want to attract new customers, and if prices do have to go up we will delay that for as long as possible.\" Centrica - which hiked prices by 6% last November - reported a 9% increase in profits to \u00a31.58bn for the first six months of the year for its entire business spanning power generation and supply. Profits in the residential arm of British Gas rose 3% to \u00a3356m from \u00a3345m, as the company reported that gas consumption was 13% higher per customer during the cold weather. British Gas prompted widespread criticism with last year's price increase, which added \u00a380 a year to the average dual-fuel customer's bill. The company, which serves 10m households, promised in May it would use its profits to keep prices down, but has refused to put a date on the duration of this price pledge. Consumer groups urged British Gas to freeze energy bills for the rest of the year. Tom Lyon at uSwitch.com, said: \"The fact that British Gas has absorbed increasing costs so far this year will be of cold comfort to consumers who may be fearing the worst \u2013 especially with rumours of price rises. Profits are up from last year, so we would urge British Gas to help quell customer's fears and go one step further from its May pledge and commit to a price freeze for the rest of the year.\" \"People are already starting to worry about next winter and the cost of their energy bills and high energy prices have a big impact on consumers. Last winter, almost seven in 10 (69%) households went without heating at some point to keep their energy costs down.\" Centrica blamed \"volatile\" prices on the wholesale gas market and \"environmental costs\" for adding to price pressures on the business. Wholesale gas prices accounted for 48% (\u00a3568) of the average annual gas and electricity bill of \u00a31,188 for Centrica's customers in 2012. Prices in the wholesale gas market were 10% higher than this time last year, said energy trader Gary Hornby at Inenco. \"If there is another cold winter and we have another supply situation that we did last time there is a good chance that prices will unfortunately go up,\" he said. \"If we have a mild winter it could go the other way.\" Richard Hall, head of energy regulation at Consumer Futures, warned that the big energy companies were not giving consumers the full story about their costs. Large energy suppliers had a tendency to \"cherry-pick\" dates to make the case that high wholesale gas prices were pushing up prices. \"It doesn't appear there is so much pressure on the wholesale market that it can justifiably be used as threat of justifying price rises.\" Although gas prices hit record highs in March, these on-the-day spikes were dampened out by later price falls, he added. Centrica's profit report comes after an influential committee of MPs said it was not surprising that customers mistrusted energy companies because they had failed to be transparent about the reasons for energy price rises, in an energy market that was not as competitive as it could be. Luff dismissed the charge of cherry-picking data: \"Despite what you hear about the industry we could not be more transparent ... If by some way gas prices were running at half the price we were saying we would suddenly make a lot more profit.\"",

      "bodyText": "Ryanair has announced additional flights between the UK and Ireland this winter, in a move it claims counters competition authorities' concerns about the effect of it holding nearly a 30% stake in Aer Lingus. The extra daily return to Dublin from Stansted and four other UK airports comes despite its Irish rival saying fewer British passengers are making the trip across the Irish sea. Aer Lingus blamed austerity for fewer British holidaymakers coming to Dublin, with \"disappointing\" passenger revenues from its major short-haul market. Ryanair's chief executive Michael O'Leary announced the extra services ahead of a UK Competition Commission ruling, expected as early as 13 August, that is likely to order Ryanair to reduce its 29% shareholding to protect passenger interests. He argued that in the six-and-a-half years since Ryanair has held its stake, competition has intensified, and that Wednesday's announcement of more flights proves that. He has tried three times to take over his rival, but each attempt has been rejected by the European commission. O'Leary said the competition inquiry was \"politically motivated\" and warned that he would immediately appeal against any ruling against it. \"One way or another it's going to be in courts for the next five years.\" He said: \"The Birmingham Six got more justice than we're getting off the UK Competition Commission.\" A provisional ruling in May found that Ryanair's minority stake could harm competition on UK-Ireland routes as well as blocking any purchase of Aer Lingus by other airlines. Last week Ryanair offered to sell its entire stake to any airline that made a full takeover offer, in an attempt to head off a ruling forcing it to reduce its stake. However, Christoph Mueller, chief executive of Aer Lingus, said: \"The whole argument of Ryanair is that they have no influence [on Aer Lingus] and now they want to sell 80% of the company \u2013 that is an irony.\"Aer Lingus earlier said it had been boosted by record numbers of seats filled in June on long-haul routes, driving a 5% growth in revenues. Mueller said \"significantly\" more American passengers were transferring on to continental Europe via Dublin. Dublin has an arrangement with JFK airport in New York that allows passengers to pre-clear immigration in Ireland, avoiding the long queues on arrival in the US. But Mueller said the UK market had changed. \"The first thing we recognised is that inbound UK passengers are on the decrease.\" He said that austerity and the weak pound meant people had curbed their holidays, particularly weekend breaks. Mueller also pointed to British Airways having added capacity on the Dublin-Heathrow route, \"clearly over and above what that market could afford.\" He said around 80% of the 8 million passengers flying from the UK to Ireland annually fly on Aer Lingus or Ryanair. Meanwhile Mueller insisted that the \"wet lease\" arrangement with Virgin Atlantic, under which Aer Lingus supplies planes and crew for Virgin's Little Red domestic service, would eventually be profitable, despite costs meaning it would at best break even this year. Overall losses before tax worsened by 14% to \u20ac28.2m (\u00a324.6m) for the first six months of the year compared with 2012. Following new of Ryanair's plans to offer advertising space on its planes, O'Leary was asked if he would take an advert from low-fare rival airline easyJet. \"I'd take an advert from anyone, even the UK Competition Commission,\" he said.",
