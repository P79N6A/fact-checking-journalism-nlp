    "webTitle": "Royal Mail flotation's froth just keeps getting frothier", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Five weeks after the Royal Mail flotation, the froth \u2013 as the business secretary, Vince Cable, described it \u2013 has not evaporated. Shares that were sold at 330p have been trading above 550p for the past three weeks. In hard money, the difference in market valuation is \u00a32.2bn, or \u00a31.3bn if one looks solely at the 60% stake sold by the state. Taxpayers could have done better \u2013 much better. The semi-official excuse \u2013 that a soaraway price is what can happen when a few enthusiasts chase shares in short supply \u2013 clearly carries some weight. It is true, for example, that the intervention of Chris Hohn at hedge fund TCI, who bought 5.8% of Royal Mail soon after listing (with maybe more to follow), was a surprise factor. But TCI's arrival is not a full explanation. As the business select committee attempts to find out more in the next fortnight, here are three questions: 1 Was the government too in awe of its investment bankers? Sensibly, the committee has summoned representatives from banks that were not selected as advisers but which, it is said, placed higher valuations on Royal Mail. JP Morgan's testimony should be worth hearing. If it is true that the bank told the government that Royal Mail could be worth between \u00a36.75bn and \u00a39bn under favourable market conditions, let's hear the details. If the valuation was back-of-a-fag-packet guesswork in the style of an estate agent touting for work, Cable would have been within his rights to be sceptical. But if JP Morgan had conducted in-depth analysis on Royal Mail's assets, especially its property assets, then it's a different matter. At the very least, the government should have been prepared for the possibility that Royal Mail could be a flyer, notwithstanding the company's grim record on industrial relations. Yes, the postal service was a tricky business to value. But that was an argument for being flexible until the last minute. Far too early in the process, the government seems to have accepted the view, presumably advanced by bookrunners Goldman Sachs and UBS, that \u00a33bn-ish would be a \"good\" price at which to sell. How hard did Lazards, the direct government adviser, press Goldman and UBS? 2 Was Cable too obsessed by attracting long-term investors? He was clear that he wanted Royal Mail to have \"a high-quality long-term investor base\". In principle, that's fine: excessive short-termism in markets is a problem, as the Kay report commissioned by Cable argues persuasively. And Royal Mail, with years of restructuring in prospect, is the type of firm that could benefit from having patient owners. But preferring long-term investors doesn't guarantee value-for-money for taxpayers, which was meant to be the top priority for a government that claimed to have learned the lessons of the giveaway flotations of the 1980s. What if other investors were prepared to pay more for the shares? As Hohn at TCI has demonstrated, aggressive hedge funds are free to play anyway once the shares are listed. So did the collection of preferred long-term funds \u2013 \"a focused group of approximately 20 investors,\" according to Cable \u2013 simply acquire greater influence over the final pricing of Royal Mail shares? Several, we are told, threatened to pull out if the float price was bumped above 330p. Well, they would: the government had signalled to them that they had bargaining power. 3 Why were foreign sovereign wealth funds allocated shares? The possibility of an underpricing was blindingly obvious in the days before flotation, so the government could have saved itself much aggravation by ensuring all the shares in the heavily over-subscribed offer were allocated to UK retail buyers and UK pension funds. Royal Mail, after all, was a state-owned asset funded by the UK public purse. Why should investment funds representing the governments of Kuwait, Singapore and Abu Dhabi receive a slice of cheap shares? Disappointed applicants complain the relationship between foreign wealth funds and international banks such as Goldman Sachs and UBS was just too cosy. It's a reasonable view. Are some of the big winners from the housing recovery \u2013 or bubble as London readers will see it \u2013 getting nervous? There certainly seems to be a trend to take a few chips off the table. Private equity fund Apollo this week sold its remaining 10% stake in Countrywide, the estate agency firm that floated in March and has since seen its shares surge in value. At Rightmove, the property-search website valued at an astonishing \u00a32.5bn, non-executive chairman Scott Forbes exercised share options, sold the lot, and banked \u00a33.1m before tax. His chief executive, Nick McKittrick, last month did similarly and collected \u00a36.1m. These are life-changing sums, so one can't blame the Rightmove bosses for choosing financial security for themselves. After all, profit margins of 70% \u2013 its eye-catching achievement last year on revenues of \u00a3119m \u2013 tend not to last forever. Still, \u00a32.5bn for Rightmove is an out-and-out bargain if Snapchat can be worth roughly the same sum. Never heard of it? It's the messaging service that allows you to send pictures that disappear after ten seconds. The app \u2013 apparently \u2013 is very popular with the sexting generation. Some 350m photos are shared on Snapchat every day. From a valuation point of view, there's a problem. Snapchat is free and doesn't carry adverts. Thus there are no revenues. This apparent drawback did not prevent Facebook from offering to buy Snapchat for $3bn (\u00a31.9bn), says the Wall Street Journal. Naturally, 23-year-old co-founder Evan Spiegel declined the offer. He thinks he'll get more if he waits. Brave call. But, actually, it's Facebook's shareholders who should be asking questions. If their leader Mark Zuckerberg is so rattled by a no-revenue, no-ads upstart that he is willing to buy it for $3bn, he must be worried that teenagers are already bored with Facebook.",

    "webTitle": "Lloyds boss likely to get \u00a32.3m bonus", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The boss of Lloyds Banking Group is set to be handed what is in effect a \u00a32.3m bonus next week, provided the share price remains above the level at which the taxpayer bailed out the bank for another three trading days. The potential payout to Ant\u00f3nio Horta-Os\u00f3rio, the Portuguese banker who has been at the helm for two and a half years, will only be made if the shares in the bank, which is 32% owned by the taxpayer, close above 73.6p on Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday next week. If they do so, the award will be unleashed of just over 3m shares granted to Horta-Os\u00f3rio in March, when the bonus was worth \u00a31.4m because of the share price at the time. But he will not be able to cash in the shares until 2018. The bonus shares can only be handed to him if the share price remains above 73.6p for 30 trading days or if the government had sold off least a third of its holding at prices above 61p. It was Horta-Os\u00f3rio's idea for his bonus to be tied to the share price and at the time the scheme was devised the shares were worth just 50p. He is now in line to cash in even though the bank reported a loss for the third quarter of the year as a result of the on-going impact of the payment protection mis-selling scandal \u2013 because the shares have closed above the 73.6p level since 10 October. They were perilously close to sliding through this price on November 7 but have yet to close below the key level. The taxpayer ploughed \u00a320bn into Lloyds \u2013 which rescued HBOS during the 2008 banking crisis \u2013 but has since raised \u00a33bn from the sale in September of 15% of the government's stake. The shares were placed with major City investors at 75p a share \u2013 above the average price at which the taxpayer bailed out the bank. This price was also above the 61p price that the government had stipulated be inserted into Horta-Osorio's bonus, which initially confused the City. The 61p level is based on the stock market price of the Lloyds shares when the government bought them, which was lower than the actual price that the government paid. The 61p price has been in the government's accounts since 2010 when the \u00a365bn ploughed into both Lloyds and Royal Bank of Scotland was valued at \u00a353.8bn. The government used the money raised from the share sale to cut the national debt by \u00a3586m. \"Antonio's bonus, which he won't receive until 2018, reflects the significant turnaround at Lloyds under his leadership \u2013 something that has enabled taxpayers to start getting back their money at a profit,\" a Lloyds spokesman said. A further share sale is expected before the May 2015 election and Chancellor George Osborne has said that this might include an offering of the shares to retail investors. Horta-Os\u00f3rio said last month that another tranche of shares could be sold off in 2014. The shares have been rallying this year \u2013 they started 2013 at 48p \u2013 as the bank has increased its revenue faster than expected, accelerated a reduction in its bad debts and also rebuilt its capital position, even though it reported a loss in the third quarter.

They are dangerous; we should let the automatic stabilizers work. We are willing to take structural measures with a fiscal impact, but not austerity measures,\u201d he told CNBC in an&#xa0;interview following the Ecofin meeting in Brussels. Reiterating that Athens had already achieved the biggest fiscal consolidation ever recorded in western history, he added:&#xa0;\u201cGreece has achieved tremendous progress up to now, people have made huge sacrifices; so we have to be very careful now what kind of measures we implement to close the fiscal gap, if any,\u201d he said.</p> <p>With the average Greek having suffered a 40% loss in disposable income and debt-stricken country laboring under record levels of unemployment (at nearly 28 % the highest in the euro zone)&#xa0;the deputy Greek prime minister Evangelos Venizelos also lashed out this afternoon at the prospect of more measures. \u201cOur priority is investments, corrective changes, privatisations and the gradual replacement of injustices and sacrifices,\u201d he told reporters. \u201cThere are limits that are not being put forward by the Greek government but common sense.\u201d</p> <p>The Greek finance minister will meet Troika missions heads on Sunday to discuss plugging the fiscal gap with aides saying the Greek side had a \u201cone million euro plus package\u201d of structural reforms to cover the budget black hole. </p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-45e87696-706e-4a84-a18b-3193fd2fe5ea\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/11/15/1384535736316/99bd69bf-a5b5-4837-9945-aa29c6b1465c-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Demonstrators protest during a rally yesterday in Athens, Greece.

Lower energy prices have contributed to bring inflation down. This often proves to be temporary. Much more of a concern is the fall in inflation for non-energy goods. Prices of a wide range of these goods are either stagnating or falling. Inflation has also come down to very low levels for a range of services. These trends highlight the squeeze on profit margins from subdued demand in the Eurozone.</p> <p>\"This environment is unlikely to change in the near future, which means that the ECB should be ready not only for a long period of low inflation but also for the possibility that deflation sets in. In our view, the ECB should do more to avoid deflation. One possibility would be to provide clearer forward guidance about its monetary policy.

      "bodyText": "Supported by the hopes of central banks keeping the money taps firmly on, following Fed chair-elect Janet Yellen's testimony to the US senate on Thursday, stock markets have (mostly) ended the week on a positive note: \u2022 The FTSE 100 finished 27.13 points or 0.41% higher at 6693.44 \u2022 Germany's Dax added 0.21% to 9168.69 \u2022 France's Cac closed 0.19% better at 4292.23 \u2022 Italy's FTSE MIB slipped 0.39% to 18,687.19 \u2022 Spain's Ibex dipped 0.13% to 9695.9 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently 41.61 points or 0.26% better. With that, it's time to close up for the evening. Thanks for all the comments, have a good weekend and we'll be back on Monday for all the latest developments. And since it's a Friday evening, the ever entertaining UKIP: Over in Greece senior government officials have been laying down the line on EU demands that the country enact new austerity measures as news comes in that the Greek prime minister will be holding talks with the German chancellor Angela Merkel in Berlin next week. Helena Smith writes: International pressure on Greece to implement yet more austerity to plug a prospective budget black hole t is fuelling passions in Athens. With the German government announcing that the Greek prime minister Antonis Samaras will meet for a \"working lunch\u201d with Angela Merkel in Berlin next Friday, senior officials are saying he will use the opportunity to press home the point that further across the board cuts are simply \u201cout of the question.\u201d \u201cThere would be a revolution. People can take no more and the troika [mission chiefs] have to stop being technocrats, open their eyes and realize that the government would collapse if called upon to pass more measures,\u201d said one well-placed aide. \u201cWe\u2019d be back at square one again with creditors having to face [Alexis] Tsipras,\u201d he said of the vehemently anti-austerity radical left main opposition Syriza leader. Overnight, the Greek finance minister Yannis Stournaras, in an unusual departure from the diplomatic language he usually resorts to, described the prospect of more measures as \u201cdangerous.\u201d \u201cNo austerity measures are needed. They are dangerous; we should let the automatic stabilizers work. We are willing to take structural measures with a fiscal impact, but not austerity measures,\u201d he told CNBC in an interview following the Ecofin meeting in Brussels. Reiterating that Athens had already achieved the biggest fiscal consolidation ever recorded in western history, he added: \u201cGreece has achieved tremendous progress up to now, people have made huge sacrifices; so we have to be very careful now what kind of measures we implement to close the fiscal gap, if any,\u201d he said. With the average Greek having suffered a 40% loss in disposable income and debt-stricken country laboring under record levels of unemployment (at nearly 28 % the highest in the euro zone) the deputy Greek prime minister Evangelos Venizelos also lashed out this afternoon at the prospect of more measures. \u201cOur priority is investments, corrective changes, privatisations and the gradual replacement of injustices and sacrifices,\u201d he told reporters. \u201cThere are limits that are not being put forward by the Greek government but common sense.\u201d The Greek finance minister will meet Troika missions heads on Sunday to discuss plugging the fiscal gap with aides saying the Greek side had a \u201cone million euro plus package\u201d of structural reforms to cover the budget black hole. And here's the statement from the Ecofin meeting. Once more with the US, wholesale inventories rose 0.4% in September, with August growth revised up from 0.5% to 0.8%. And for anyone wondering what is happening at the Ecofin meeting: Some good news for Ireland, with Deutsche Bank creating 700 new jobs in the country's financial sector. Henry McDonald in Dublin says: The German bank is seeking to create a regional hub and centre of excellence in Dublin's Eastpoint Business Park. It has been operating in Ireland since 1991 and already employs 300 workers. The Global Head of Financial Institutions at Deutsche, Neilus De Groot said the high standard of Ireland\u2019s graduates was a dominating factor in its decision. Most of the new workers will be hired in the next two years, he said. The expansion in Deutsche's Irish operation is being backed by the Republic's Industrial Development Authority. Ireland's Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation Richard Bruton said that it was a huge vote of confidence in the country's international financial services sector and in the Irish economy. \"International financial services is a key sector targeted as part of the Government's Action Plan for Jobs. \"This is a sustainable, export-driven industry where Ireland has developed major strengths and we have put in place important changes to target substantial jobs growth in the coming years,\" he added. Deutsche Bank's expansion comes in the same week that Enda Kenny revealed he is in discussions with Chancellor Angela Merkel to access funds for Irish small businesses from the German state KFW development bank. Back in the US, industrial production fell unexpectedly in October. It slipped 0.1% month on month after a 0.7% rise in September, as output at power plants and mines declined. Rob Carnell of ING Bank said the figures would have little effect on the timing of the Federal Reserve easing off on its bond buying programme: [This is] hardly the sort of figure that will send the Federal Reserve scrabbling to start the taper. But the headline appears worse than the underlying picture. Indeed, manufacturing production delivered a reasonable 0.3% month on month increase, and most of the softness was concentrated in utilities and mining, in particular natural gas extraction, where on-going price softness seems to have weighed on extraction activity, and production has been feeble for some months. Together with a limp report from the Empire Manufacturing survey for November, delivered before the production data, the tone of newsflow since Janet Yellen\u2019s Senate testimony, where she spelled out that taper required a notable improvement in the economy \u2013 has been mediocre. Risk markets won\u2019t be too upset by this. Sterling has moved higher against the dollar and euro after Bank of England policymaker Martin Weale said it could not ignore inflation expectations, and may have to raise rates before all spare capacity in the economy is used up. Upbeat UK economic data this week and comments from Bank governor Mark Carney have raised the prospects of interest rates rising more quickly than previously expected. Weale's comments seem to be adding to that idea. He said: We cannot risk a situation where people say we are deliberately looking the other way if the data show a significant change in inflation expectations. Earlier, in a speech in London, European Central Bank board member Yves Mersch said it would not be easy to turn off the money taps, even as he repeated suggestions it could buy assets from banks if needed.He said: Obviously it will not be an easy matter to get out of the low rates of our policies. We are not there yet...there are more questions that have to be addressed before we address this question. But that does not mean we are not considering (it) and we don't have it at the back of our mind. ECB member Peter Praet became the first of its policymakers to talk about asset buying, and today Mersch said it was an option, but there were difficulties: In our mandate it says we can do asset purchases...but Europe is a little bit different in so far that we do not have a single sovereign signature. Quotes courtesy Reuters. Mixed signals from the US, where the New York state manufacturing sector unexpectedly shrank although business confidence was relatively stable. The Federal Reserve's Empire manufacturing index fell to -2.21 from 1.52 in October (anything below zero indicating a contraction). But the index of business conditions was 37.51, edging down from 40.76. Annalisa Piazza at Newedge Strategy said: The outcome is much weaker than expected and it marks the lowest print since the start of the year. The breakdown of the report shows a marked deterioration in all the main components, a sign that activity has registered some slowdown over the month despite less pressure on the fiscal side. All in all, the picture described by today's report is not encouraging as it looks like the effects of the fiscal debate and government shutdown have not waned yet. ... in the next few months says Cypriot minister of finance Harris Georgiades in an interview with Reuters. Says restrictions are already looser than in March, when the independent southern section of the island was forced to close two banks and slap controls on money transfers to prevent economic collapse. And with that, I'm handing over to my colleague Nick Fletcher. More from the EU, this time its disease monitoring agency. In a sobering report, it says there are several categories of bacteria that cannot be killed with with carbapenems, the most powerful class of antibiotic drugs. Reuters reports the European Centre for Diseases Prevention and Control saying the proportion of infections resistant to carbapenems has increased sharply in the last four years - particularly in southern Europe - and almost all European countries now have reported cases. The most severe cases involve bloodstream infections, but drug-resistant bugs can also more frequently cause serious problems in the respiratory and urinary tracts. Reuters said: \"The ECDC data showed that the proportion of bloodstream infections due to Klebsiella pneumoniae, a common cause of illness in hospital patients, that were resistant to carbapenems was above 5 percent in 2012 in five countries - Greece, Cyprus, Italy, Romania and Slovakia. \"In recent years, there has been a rush for the exit by the drugs industry as its researchers have struggled to find leads for novel antimicrobial drugs. Companies have turned instead to more profitable lines of drug research, including treatments for cancer and chronic diseases. A consortium of drug firms berated the government in a letter today for allowing the NHS to reject drugs at the cost of many lives, though these are mostly anti-obesity and related drugs that are expected to be hugely profitable as the world gets fatter. Reuters added: \"Pfizer, once the leader in the field, closed its antibiotic research centre in Connecticut in 2011, to the dismay of many scientists. It now focuses anti-bacterial work on vaccines. Others to have quit include Bristol-Myers Squibb and Eli Lilly, leaving only a handful of firms like \"GlaxoSmithKline and Merck &amp; Co in the game. Switzerland's Roche, however, has re-entered the arena through a $550 million tie-up with privately held Polyphor this month to develop and commercialise an experimental antibiotic against hospital superbugs.\" Marie Diron, senior economic adviser to the EY Eurozone Forecast, says a look beneath the headline figures in today's Eurozone inflation data shows it is a long term problem: \"Today's inflation data are interesting not so much about the headline inflation rate, which we knew would be very low, but about evidence of how broad-based downward price pressures are. Lower energy prices have contributed to bring inflation down. This often proves to be temporary. Much more of a concern is the fall in inflation for non-energy goods. Prices of a wide range of these goods are either stagnating or falling. Inflation has also come down to very low levels for a range of services. These trends highlight the squeeze on profit margins from subdued demand in the Eurozone. \"This environment is unlikely to change in the near future, which means that the ECB should be ready not only for a long period of low inflation but also for the possibility that deflation sets in. In our view, the ECB should do more to avoid deflation. One possibility would be to provide clearer forward guidance about its monetary policy. This could have a significant impact on the euro exchange rate which would both help raise inflation and boost growth.\" Looks like the cigarette smuggling dispute between Spain and Gibraltar is going to rumble on after EU officials said Madrid's near blockade of the island is lawful. Maybe blockade is a bit over the top. Maybe extra security is a better phrase. Well, Britain is not going to be happy. the extra checks that have upset so many locals are likely to carry on. But who knows, maybe the Spanish have a point. Maybe they are suffering from Gibraltar's ultra low cigarette tax, which makes its ciggies 40% cheaper than those sold on the mainland. Come on Rock inhabitants, you know smoking is bad for you. Put a decent tax on fags. The the Spanish would have to think again, cos they always undermine their principled stand against Gibraltar's independence when they refuse to give up Cueta, the \"autonomous city of Spain\" located on the north African coast where Tunisia should be. AP is reporting that not only is the one child policy to be relaxed (parents can have two children if only one parent was an only child rather than previous policy of both parents being only children), but a host of business measures have also been agreed. In that vein, China's leaders have promised to open its markets wider to private and foreign competitors. The country's consumption tax will be expanded to cover polluting products. Property tax reform wil be accelerated. New environmental taxes to be devised. Also sectors protected from foreign investment to be opened up. AP said Chinese leaders are under pressure to replace a \"tapped-out growth model based on exports and investment\". It said: \"The ruling party pledged in Friday's report to allow the creation of privately owned banks and to allow the market to allocate resources moves that will help more efficient private companies. \"As for foreign companies, the plan pledges to ease limits on foreign investment in e-commerce and other industries.\" Annalisa Piazza, analyst at Newedge Strategy, said in an note that ECB details of next week's LTRO early repayments, just announced, illustrate how weak the European financial system remains. \"On Wed, 5 banks will repay a total of \u20ac3.155bn of the first 3y LTRO and 3 banks will repay a very modest \u20ac0.431bn of the second 3y LTRO. The total amount is just a touch below market expectations of \u20ac4bn (Reuters poll) and around \u20ac2bn below the average repayments of the past 4 weeks,\" she said. \"Around \u20ac380bn out of the total \u20ac1013bn borrowed has been repaid so far. The ECB remains \"alert\" on the development of liquidity conditions (excess liquidity below \u20ac200bn) but Draghi made clear during last week's press conference that there is no direct correlation between liquidity and eonia rates. As such, no additional action was needed at the current juncture given the limited movements in money market rates. That said, the tone of the ECB remained extremely dovish and Draghi left the door open to any option in the coming months. We rule out that further liquidity will be injected in early 2014 but Q4 additional measures are still in the cards.\" ... while French, Spanish and Dutch draft plans barely make it, the European Commission said today. If you want to know what losing national self determination feels like, you need look no further than the Brussels' judgements on national budgets. Poland and Croatia face sanctions for running persistently high deficits. According to some analysts, Poland's misdeeds could hamper its entry to the euro Anyway, the review marks the first time Brussels has enjoyed such gorgeous, unalloyed power to criticise the finance proposals of member states, at least those inside the eurozone. Technically, the EU's executive arm is doing no more than reviewing the main assumptions of draft national budgets to assess if they are in line with EU laws. This is before they are submitted to national parliaments. However, the commission can demand a revised budget plan from a euro zone country if its draft clearly breaks EU rules, There are 19 EU countries under investigation at the moment for breaking various rules, after Germany was added this week for running monster current account surpluses that Brussels believes could be as bad for the currency zone as large annual deficits. Italy, the eurozone's third biggest economy, wants some leeway because its public debt is rising rather than falling and it suffers chronically low growth. \"There is a risk that the draft budgetary plan for 2014 will not be compliant with the rules,\" the commission said in a statement. \"In particular, the debt reduction benchmark in 2014 is not respected,\" it said. The commission said that the eurozone's second biggest economy France had taken the recommended steps to reduce its budget gap below 3 percent in 2013, and its 2014 draft budget is in line with EU budget rules, but with no margin for error, reported Reuters . Also, France's structural reform plans made only \"limited progress\", the commission said. There is an exaggerated sense of the story in that headline, but nonetheless it is positive for employment in Aberdeen and Shetland, even if it will have the green lobby crying into its nettle tea (I prefer strawberry with a hint of mango). Aberdeen-based EnQuest said it will generate billions in taxpayer revenues, create 20,000 construction jobs and 1,000 ongoing roles with its development of the Kraken oilfield east of the Shetland Islands. It will invest \u00a34bn as part of the project. The plans are understood to represent the largest UK North Sea investment announced this year. The government has handed the company oil allowances enabling it to claim tax relief on around \u00a3800m of profits, which offsets the \"billions in taxpayer revenues\", which these days mean extra income tax, national insurance and VAT, not corporation tax. All hail the holders of capital, we bow before you. Back to the story. EnQuest chief executive Amjad Bseisu said: \"Kraken is a transformational project for EnQuest and we are delighted to be able to proceed with it, working with the Government and our partners to maximise the extraction of approximately 140 million barrels of oil in this field, over its 25-year-long life. \"It is only by combining our skills and expertise with fiscal incentives, such as heavy oil allowances, that really substantial projects like Kraken are possible.\" Along with Estonia. Eurostat said: \"In October 2013, the lowest annual rates were observed in Greece (-1.9%), Bulgaria (-1.1%) and Cyprus (-0.5%), and the highest in Estonia and the United Kingdom (both 2.2%) and Finland (1.7%). Compared with September 2013, annual inflation fell in twenty-three Member States, remained stable in one and rose in four. The lowest 12- month average rates up to October 2013 were registered in Greece (-0.4%), Latvia (0.3%) and Sweden (0.5%), and the highest in Romania (3.7%), Estonia (3.5%), Croatia and the Netherlands (both 2.9%). \"The largest upward impacts to euro area annual inflation came from electricity (+0.11 percentage points), accommodation services (+0.09) and tobacco (+0.08), while fuels for transport (-0.31), telecommunications (-0.16) and heating oil (-0.08) had the biggest downward impacts. \" It illustrates the power of oil to move inflation up and down. While it is a huge drag on prices at the moment, an upwards move in the oil price would quickly reverse the situation. Says the New York Post, which is obviously not the final arbiter on healthcare policy, but the headlines tweeted by Joe Weisenthal of Business Insider are not going to make for enjoyable reading in the White House. It is a lesson to all governments that a dodgy, hurried website can let down years of good work. Euro areaannual inflation was 0.7% in October 2013, down from 1.1% in September. A year earlier the rate was 2.5%. Monthly inflation was -0.1% in October 2013. EU down to 0.9% Food giant Nestle is to create 1,600 jobs for young people over the next three years, and hundreds of paid work experience placements. The company, which still wrestles with accusations of selling baby milk to African mothers, is already a major employer in the UK with centres in Buxton (bottling), York (chocolate) and Cumbria (coffee), while its head office recently moved from Croydon to Gatwick in Sussex. The Press Association reports that the jobs will range from sales assistants to business management as well as working on the shop floor. Chief executive Fiona Kendrick said: \"Sadly, young people in the UK and Ireland are stuck in a catch-22 situation - they can't get a job without experience, but can't get experience without a job. \"As employers we value young people with experience, so we have to provide them with enough opportunities to gain it.\" Nestle said it will offer 300 paid work experience placements in its factories, offices and sales teams as well as helping social enterprise group MyKindaCrowd to give skills and employability training to more than 12,000 school and college students. The placements will be for four weeks and will pay above the national minimum wage. Should have said earlier, but it is never too late to talk about the Japanese stock market, which rose to a sixth month high last night at 15,165, up almost 2% on the day. The strengthening dollar had something to do with it and gains on Wall Street. The US stock market maintained its upward trajectory following doveish remarks by Janet Yellen (see earlier post). Abenomics seems to have lost is lustre, but if the US dollar rises then japanese exports have a free run and Toyota's profits will carry on rising. In an unrelated move, the Japanese government increased its target for greenhouse gas emissions, which was probably inevitable after the shutdown of all its nuclear power stations. Some of them may reopen, though the Fukushima disaster means they are likely to stay shut and Japan's reliance on imported liquid gas will continue. Reuters reports that Joerg Asmussen, European Central Bank board member, said this morning that eurozone governments must put in place ways to financially support their banks in case they need more capital. Speaking ahead of the Eurogroup's second day of meetings, Asmussen said health checks by the ECB found there were still plenty of banks with weak balance sheets. Today finance ministers are discussing backstops for banks in time for the ECB's asset quality review, the results of which are due in October 2014. \"We will continue to discuss this today,\" Asmussen said on entering the meeting. \"From the ECB side we always said it was absolutely necessary that we have credible backstops in place before the whole exercise starts, so we need three layers of backstops. These are first private markets, second domestic markets, or domestic bank rescue funds, and the third layer is the European Stability Mechanism (ESM) as it stands,\" he said.

The buck passing has annoyed Treasury select committee chairman and Tory MP Andrew Tyrie, who has written to BoE governor Mark Carney asking him to clarify the position. Eurozone deflation fears are expected to heighten when the final readings for eurozone consumer price inflation (CPI) are published. They are expected to confirm price rises have slowed alarmingly. The ECB\u2019s Erkki Liikanen and Yves Mersch will speak today with markets looking for more comments on the policy outlook. Analysts reckon there will also be much speculation on divides in the ECB board's ranks after the recent rate cut to 0.25%. The cut split opinion and pitted president Mario Draghi against some of his colleagues. Mike van Dulken, Head of Research at Accendo Markets, said there is a general expectation for the FTSE 100 to open +5pts at 6675. \"Another positive performance from both the US and Asian equity sessions after FedChairwoman-elect Janet Yellen supported her pre-released text with a robust testimony before the Senate Banking committee in defending theFed\u2019s policies and stating that she doesn\u2019t see tapering of QE3 for a good while yet with benefits exceeding costs for now and early withdrawal a big risk amid a fragile recovery,\" he said in a note. He continued: \"Japan\u2019s Nikkei again the outperformer (&gt;15,000) thanks to a weaker JPY (USD/JPY &gt;100) as officials signal they are prepared to fight to keep currency weak. Expectations and optimism about the release of some much-desired additional details on Chinese economic reforms next week also got markets excited helping China and Hong Kong muster good gains.\" Hi, I\u2019m Phillip Inman, The Guardian\u2019s economics correspondent. I\u2019m stepping in for Graeme Wearden today. This morning we can look forward to euro area inflation at 10am. There\u2019s an Ecofin ministers meeting today - last night the Eurogroup told Greece to make more progress in its negotiations with the troika There\u2019s usually an Ecofin press conference around lunchtime. Janet Yellen was giving heavy hints in her testimony to Congress that she would keep monetary policy loose if given the job of succeeding Ben Bernanke as Federal Reserve boss. There should be some more market and analyst reaction today. Also, I\u2019ll keep an eye on the FTSE, which is coming off a peak in October, where it neared 6800. Was yesterday the beginning of another rally?",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Brussels has urged Italy and Spain to redraft their tax and spending plans or risk breaching eurozone debt rules in 2014. The two countries were singled out for criticism in the first report issued as part of the so-called Two-Pack process, under which countries in the single currency area agreed to far closer scrutiny of their economic policies. The censure came just a day after Spain announced that it would leave the \u20ac41bn (\u00a334bn) EU bailout programme it has drawn on to rescue its teetering banks. In the more stringent surveillance regime adopted since the financial crisis, the single currency's 17 member countries are now required to submit an annual draft budgetary plan, detailing spending totals and proposed economic reforms, to be picked over by Brussels. Countries are required to keep budget deficits below 3% of GDP, and debt levels below 60%, under the eurozone's Stability and Growth Pact \u2013 though those targets were widely ignored in the runup to 2008. More than half of member countries are currently in an Excessive Debt Procedure, which sets a time limit for them to get their budgets back on track. Italy and Spain are widely seen in financial markets as the most likely candidates to be forced to seek help from the European Central Bank's (ECB) emergency bailout scheme, known as \"outright monetary transactions\" in the coming years. Both countries were invited by Brussels to \"take the necessary measures within the national budgetary process\" to prevent them busting the targets. Italy's finance ministry protested after the commission's judgment: \"In formulating its opinion, the commission does not take into account important measures announced by the government.\" Several other countries were also censured by Brussels on Friday as part of its \"autumn fiscal surveillance package\". France, whose economy has slipped into reverse, according to growth figures released this week, was accused of making limited progress on the structural reforms, such as changes in labour market regulations, recommended by the commission. Germany, which has already been accused by its European partners \u2013 and the US Treasury secretary Jack Lew - of saving too much, and spending too little, was told that it had made no progress in structural reforms. \"As soon as a new federal government takes office, national authorities are encouraged to submit an updated draft budgetary plan,\" Friday's report said. Croatia was also warned that it may face action under the Excessive Deficit Procedure for breaking deficit limits. With both growth and inflation in the eurozone slowing \u2013 the latest official figures released on Friday confirmed that inflation was just 0.7% in the year to October \u2013 the commission's verdicts will add to an increasingly fraught debate in Europe about how best to manage the eurozone's 17 economies. Some countries, including France, believe the euro is too strong on foreign exchange markets, jeopardising exports; but after last week's quarter-percentage point rate cut, Germany is reluctant to see further moves by the ECB that might help to guide the euro downwards. The European commission also urged countries across the eurozone to beware of slashing public investment as they battle to balance their budgets, and focus instead on cutting day-to-day government expenditure. \"The general trend of decreasing public capital expenditure observed in the past few years, while stabilising, is not being reversed,\" it said. In aggregate, across the 17 member-countries, the commission expects spending cuts worth 0.25% of eurozone GDP to be implemented in 2014.",

There was talk the US could start winding down its $85bn a month bond buying programme before the end of the year - again, ahead of expectations - after remarks from various Federal Reserve members.

Deutsche Bank cut its price target from 630p to 440p, saying:</p> <blockquote> On the back of the profit warning, we are reducing our 2013 and 2014 earnings per share forecasts by 11% and 14% to 38.9p and 35.6p, respectively. Our 2014 operating profit of \u00a3267.8m compares to management's guidance that 2014 operating profit would be modestly below 2013 levels, which we estimate will be around \u00a3300m.

There is also a Serious Fraud Office investigation to contend with which is unlikely to be concluded this year in our view. Therefore, 2014 is likely to be a lean year in terms of UK government contract awards. 2015 is unlikely to see much improvement given it is an election year when public sector contract awards typically slow. Therefore around half of Serco's revenue base will, at best, be flat for the next two years, in our view. </blockquote> <p>Supermarkets were under pressure, with <strong>Tesco</strong> suffering downgrades from HSBC and Goldman Sachs on worries about future UK growth.

      "bodyText": "Mining shares ended a volatile week on a positive note yesterday, recovering from earlier falls on worries about Chinese growth and mirroring an uncertain few days for stock markets. Initial announcements about China's much anticipated ten year economic plan proved a disappointment, lacking much detail on how the country's targets were to be achieved.

      "bodyText": "When the chauffeur- driven company Bentley with the personalised plates \u2013 1CE, of course \u2013 collected me from the station, I wasn't expecting its owner to call me a twat or \"do a Saatchi\" and mock-strangle me. I wasn't expecting to find a nude calendar in his boardroom toilet, either \u2013 but with hindsight I don't know why not. Businessmen are very powerful \u2013 this one is worth hundreds of millions and employs 25,000 people \u2013 so obviously it's important to try to understand their world. But they are often such unfathomable personalities. On this occasion I'd have about as much chance making sense of a hippopotamus, and the incomprehension is definitely mutual. \"You leave me breathless,\" he explodes at one point, before snapping \"Shut up\" and telling me not just how to write this article, but how to read his book \u2013 \"Don't skim it!\" But before dispatching me again in the Bentley he inscribes a signed copy: \"To my Guardian-writing, coffee-drinking (latte), left-wing friend\", so who knows? Maybe we got on after all. Malcolm Walker has been in business for 43 years, ever since Woolworths sacked him for setting up his own frozen-food shop. He made a huge success of Iceland and floated it as a public company in 1984, before resigning in 2001 over allegations of improper share dealing. Exonerated, Walker returned to run the company in 2005, since when profits have been back up and he has reassumed ownership through a management buy-out. The CEO of Sainsbury's describes him as one of modern retail's \"true characters\". According to Terry Leahy, the former Tesco boss, he is \"a genius\". In the past month Walker has also become something of a celebrity, due to a three-part BBC documentary series about Iceland called Life in the Freezer Cabinet. He agreed to it because last year Iceland was voted Best Big Company to Work For, which he thought would surprise a lot of people. In the series we watched shop staff weep with joy to win a Christmas bonus, and Walker whisk managers abroad on \"incentivising\" jaunts. But we also saw a lot of very poor, often overweight customers buy processed ready meals such as doner kebab pizza for one or two quid, and watched young HR staff in a former mining town make long-term unemployed applicants perform childish exercises involving ping-pong balls to assess their psychological suitability for a part-time delivery driver job. More than 200 applied for 24 positions, but Iceland wants only \"happy people\". To me it felt like a documentary about poverty. A Michelin-starred chef serves us sea bass for lunch in the staff canteen at Iceland's HQ near Chester, while Walker explains that the nude calendar in his toilet is only there because it was shot inside Iceland's aeroplane, which Walker had bought but not used after learning he'd have to pay VAT on it. He's perfectly cheerful when I suggest this excuse is absurd, and roars with laughter when asked whether the calendar would be in his boardroom toilet had it been a gay male porn shoot instead. \"No!\" he hoots, \"because \u2026 \" I'm not allowed to say why, because his long-suffering PR adviser has blanched, and a grinning Walker quickly reminds me that we are \"still off the record\". He gives a proud tour of the model Iceland store on site, though seems quite keen for us to get back to his office after the first thing I pull out of a freezer \u2013 a \u00a31 cottage pie \u2013 lists Maltodextrin, a commercial bulking agent, in its ingredients, as well as something called \"beef connective tissue\". Curiously, a packet of the Bubble Bobble Prawns we saw on TV being created in Thailand boasts of being produced in the UK. Walker looks fleetingly puzzled. But it's only when the Dictaphone comes on that things start to get tricky. Walker says he cares passionately about his customers, and removed all artificial flavouring, colours and preservatives from Iceland food in 1986. (Actually it takes less than a minute on the store's website to find an Iceland ready meal containing an artificial preservative, E233, but in fairness these are rare.) He also tells me Iceland ditched hydrogenated fats 16 years before Marks &amp; Spencer got rid of them. (Iceland's own literature says both retailers removed them in 2006.) I agree that Iceland food probably is, as he keeps saying, better than many people think. But I wonder whether he shared any viewers' discomfort at the contrasting spectacle of his Elizabethan manor house, 82-foot yacht and Range Rover, and the poverty of the customers who have helped make him rich. \"Hang on!\" he erupts. \"Some people in poverty shop in Iceland, but we are across all demographic groups. You've shopped in Iceland! Well, you're posh.\" Compared to his core market I am, I agree \u2013 but just because the Duke of Edinburgh may once have read the Guardian, that doesn't make him a typical Guardian reader. \"Do I have to live in a council house, then, because of who our customers are?\" No, I'm trying to find out how he feels about making millions selling cheap food to people who would not buy it were they not poor. \"Absolute bollocks! Don't you dare write that down. That is your opinion, not fact.\" For a moment I think he must be joking. Why else is almost everything in Iceland priced \u00a31, \u00a32 or \u00a33? It makes shopping easier for people on a tiny budget who can't afford to miscalculate by even 50p. But Walker isn't having any of it, and keeps insisting his core market isn't poor. I tell him I've lived very near an Iceland for enough years to know this simply isn't true. He walks out. Reading on mobile? Click here to watch video He's back a moment later, with an animated spiel about how much fresher and healthier his frozen food is compared to \"fresh\" food sold in more expensive supermarkets. \"You instinctively think that a nice row of chiller cabinets in Waitrose must be fresher, but it isn't. You make a chicken casserole, freeze half, leave the other half in the fridge. After 12 days do you want to eat the half that's in the freezer, or the fridge? The freezer, 'cos the other half is off. So how can Waitrose have a chilled ready meal with a 12-day shelf life? Because it's full of preservatives! People do not understand that chilled ready meals are full of preservatives. They have to be! Otherwise you wouldn't get the shelf life. Whereas freezing food, as I always say, is God's way of preserving food.\" This would be an excellent point, if it were true. I bought three chilled cottage pies on the way home \u2013 from Tesco, Marks &amp; Spencer and Waitrose \u2013 and not one contained a single preservative. Walker gets even more worked up when I ask why, when he loves his customers so much, he is happy to sell them heavily processed food containing ingredients nobody has ever used in a domestic kitchen. \"I fail to understand where you are coming from. Most of our products don't have this stuff in that you're talking about.\" But the first thing I found in the freezer did, I point out. \"Hang on, connective tissue, we've got to put that on the packet 'cos it's in mince. Buy your mince from the butcher and it's got it in it.\" But it doesn't appear in the ingredients list on any of the other cottage pies I bought. \"Give me your notepad,\" he barks, and starts scribbling down figures. \"Right. Although we are known as a frozen-food company, frozen food is only a third of our sales. Another third is branded groceries. Another third is chilled. And out of that one third of frozen, only 16% is ready meals. What is 16% of a third? It's fuck all. So don't focus on ready meals, because you are wrong, mathematically you are wrong. This is middle-class prejudice, and it is factually wrong.\" OK then, I say, what percentage of Iceland's food would he describe as healthy? Silence. \"That isn't my concern.\" He's not concerned about selling high-calorie junk food to overweight people? He walks out again. When he reappears I ask if he's getting properly angry. \"Yeah, because you're just being a twat.\" I tell him I think he is just being disingenuous. \"You ask me if I'm concerned about the health of our customers. If I wasn't, we would not have done what we did in the way of cleaning up our products ahead of all the industry. Why have we done that? That's not to make money; there's a cost involved. And why did we get rid of all fridge freezers with CFCs 20 years ago?\" I honestly don't know. That's what I'm trying to understand. If Walker were just another Michael O'Leary, the Ryanair boss famous for his candid indifference to customers, there would be no confusion. O'Leary's version of a capitalist tycoon makes perfect sense; safety aside, he doesn't claim to care about anything except the bottom line. Walker is more complicated. He says he got rid of freezers containing CFCs, and most artificial additives, out of \"concern for the health of the nation\". In the next breath he adds, \"We're not here to make the world a better place, we are running a business to make a profit.\" He does not use zero-hours contracts, dismissing them as useful only to \"a despot running a minimum-wage, don't-give-a-shit-about-your-employees environment\", and when he saw what his own HR staff were making job applicants do, \"I was horrified. I said what the hell are we doing playing games? It was stupid, so I stopped it.\" And he pays his checkout staff more than any other high-street retailer except Tesco \u2013 \u00a37.75 an hour inside the M25, \u00a37.05 outside \u2013 with delivery drivers on \u00a38.80 and \u00a38.30. So why doesn't he pay the living wage? After all, he got rid of the CFCs in his fridge freezers simply because, he said at the time, it was \"the right thing to do\". So why not the living wage? He looks at me as if I must be mad. \"It would cost us \u00a39.5m. We can't just lop \u00a39.5m off our profits!\" I keep trying to tease out just where the line between profit and altruism lies for him, but by now he clearly thinks I am quite mad. \"You are a full-treatment socialist, aren't you? I can't believe it!\" he despairs, when I ask if he's ever thought about whether it is fair to have made so much from people who have so little. \"Do you think my staff earning \u00a38 an hour or whatever are resentful of the fact that I've got a nice car? No, of course they're not! And the staff we took by private jet to Monaco for their millionaire's weekend on my boat, did they resent it? No, they loved it! There is no resentment here, and why should there be?

      "body": "<p>When the chauffeur- driven company Bentley with the personalised plates \u2013 1CE, of&#xa0;course \u2013 collected me from the station, I wasn't expecting its owner to call me a twat or \"do a Saatchi\" and mock-strangle me. I wasn't expecting to find a nude calendar in his boardroom toilet, either \u2013 but with&#xa0;hindsight I&#xa0;don't know why not. Businessmen are&#xa0;very powerful \u2013 this one is worth hundreds of millions and employs 25,000 people \u2013 so obviously it's important to try to&#xa0;understand their world. But they are often such unfathomable personalities. On this occasion I'd have about as much chance making sense of a hippopotamus, and the incomprehension is definitely mutual.</p> <p>\"You leave me breathless,\" he explodes at one point, before snapping \"Shut up\" and telling me not just how to&#xa0;write this article, but how to read his&#xa0;book \u2013 \"Don't skim it!\" But before dispatching me again in the Bentley he inscribes a signed copy: \"To my Guardian-writing, coffee-drinking (latte),&#xa0;left-wing friend\", so who knows?&#xa0;Maybe we got on after all.</p> <p>Malcolm Walker has been in business for 43 years, ever since Woolworths sacked him for setting up his own frozen-food shop. He made a huge success of Iceland and floated it as a public company in 1984, before resigning in 2001 over allegations of improper share dealing. Exonerated, Walker returned to run the company in 2005, since when profits have been back up and he has reassumed ownership through a management buy-out. The CEO of Sainsbury's describes him as one of modern retail's \"true characters\". According to Terry Leahy, the former Tesco boss, he is \"a genius\".</p> <p>In the past month Walker has also become something of a celebrity, due to a three-part BBC documentary series about Iceland called <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2013/oct/19/iceland-life-in-the-freezer-cabinet-andrew-collins\" title=\"\">Life in the Freezer Cabinet</a>. He agreed to it because last year Iceland was <a href=\"http://www.thegrocer.co.uk/companies/discounters/iceland/sunday-times-names-iceland-as-uks-best-big-employer/226487.article\" title=\"\">voted Best Big Company to Work For</a>, which he thought would surprise a lot of people. In the series we watched shop staff weep with joy to win a Christmas bonus, and Walker whisk managers abroad on \"incentivising\" jaunts. But we also saw a lot of very poor, often overweight customers buy processed ready meals such as doner kebab pizza for one or two quid, and watched young HR staff in a former mining town make long-term unemployed applicants perform childish exercises involving ping-pong balls to assess their psychological suitability for a part-time delivery driver job. More than 200 applied for 24 positions, but Iceland wants only \"happy people\". To me it felt&#xa0;like a documentary about poverty.</p> <p>A Michelin-starred chef serves us sea bass for lunch in the staff canteen at Iceland's HQ near Chester, while Walker explains that the nude calendar in his toilet is only there because it was shot inside Iceland's aeroplane, which Walker had bought but not used after learning he'd have to pay VAT on it. He's perfectly cheerful when I suggest this excuse is absurd, and roars with laughter when asked whether the calendar would be in his boardroom toilet had it been a gay male porn shoot instead. \"No!\" he hoots, \"because \u2026 \" I'm not allowed to say why, because his long-suffering PR adviser has blanched, and a grinning Walker quickly reminds me that we are \"still off the record\". He gives a proud tour of the model Iceland store on site, though seems quite keen for us to get back to his office after the first thing I&#xa0;pull out of a freezer \u2013 a \u00a31 cottage pie \u2013 lists Maltodextrin, a commercial bulking agent, in its ingredients, as well as something called \"beef connective tissue\". Curiously, a packet of the Bubble Bobble Prawns we saw on TV being created in Thailand boasts of being produced in the UK. Walker looks fleetingly puzzled. But it's only when the Dictaphone comes on that things start to get tricky.</p> <p>Walker says he cares passionately about his customers, and removed all artificial flavouring, colours and preservatives from Iceland food in 1986. (Actually it takes less than a minute on the store's website to find an Iceland ready meal containing an artificial preservative, E233, but in fairness these are rare.) He also tells me Iceland ditched hydrogenated fats 16 years before Marks &amp; Spencer got rid of them. (Iceland's own literature says both retailers removed them in 2006.) I agree that Iceland food probably is, as he keeps saying, better than many people think. But I wonder whether he shared any viewers' discomfort at the contrasting spectacle of his Elizabethan manor house, 82-foot yacht and Range Rover, and the poverty of the customers who have helped make him rich.</p> <p>\"Hang on!\" he erupts. \"<em>Some</em> people in poverty shop in Iceland, but we are across all demographic groups. You've shopped in Iceland! Well, you're posh.\" Compared to his core market I am, I&#xa0;agree \u2013 but just because the Duke of Edinburgh may once have read the Guardian, that doesn't make him a typical Guardian reader. \"Do I have to live in a council house, then, because of who our customers are?\" No, I'm trying to find out how he feels about making millions selling cheap food to people who would not buy it were they not poor.</p> <p>\"Absolute bollocks! Don't you dare write that down. That is your opinion, not fact.\" For a moment I think he must be joking. Why else is almost everything in Iceland priced \u00a31, \u00a32 or \u00a33? It makes shopping easier for people on a tiny budget who can't afford to miscalculate by even 50p. But Walker isn't having any of it, and keeps insisting his core market isn't poor. I tell him I've lived very near an Iceland for enough years to know this simply isn't true. He walks out.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/h8yiIyYoxdg?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\"                                                                        > <iframe id=\"ytplayer-h8yiIyYoxdg\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/h8yiIyYoxdg?enablejsapi=1&amp;version=3&amp;enablejsapi=1&amp;version=3&amp;enablejsapi=1&amp;version=3\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"283\" width=\"460\"></iframe> </figure>   <p><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h8yiIyYoxdg\">Reading on mobile? Click here to watch video<br></a><br>He's back a moment later, with an animated spiel about how much fresher and healthier his frozen food is compared to \"fresh\" food sold in more expensive supermarkets. \"You instinctively think that a nice row of chiller cabinets in Waitrose must be fresher, but it isn't. You make a chicken casserole, freeze half, leave the other half in the fridge. After 12 days do you want to eat the half that's in the freezer, or the fridge? The freezer, 'cos the other half is off. So how can Waitrose have a chilled ready meal with a 12-day shelf life? Because it's full of preservatives! People do not understand that chilled ready meals are full of preservatives. They have to be! Otherwise you wouldn't get the shelf life. Whereas freezing food, as I always say, is&#xa0;God's way of preserving food.\"</p> <p>This would be an excellent point, if it were true. I bought three chilled cottage pies on the way home \u2013 from Tesco, Marks &amp; Spencer and Waitrose \u2013 and not one contained a single preservative.</p> <p>Walker gets even more worked up when I ask why, when he loves his customers so much, he is happy to sell them heavily processed food containing ingredients nobody has ever used in a&#xa0;domestic kitchen. \"I fail to understand where you are coming from. Most of our products don't have this stuff in that you're talking about.\" But the first thing I found in the freezer did, I point out. \"Hang on, connective tissue, we've got to put that on the packet 'cos it's in mince. Buy your mince from the butcher and it's got it in it.\" But it doesn't appear in the ingredients list on any of the other cottage pies I bought.</p> <p>\"Give me your notepad,\" he barks, and starts scribbling down figures. \"Right. Although we are known as a frozen-food company, frozen food is only a third of our sales. Another third is branded groceries. Another third is chilled. And out of that one third of frozen, only 16% is ready meals. What is 16% of a third? It's fuck all. So don't focus on ready meals, because you are wrong, mathematically you are wrong. This is middle-class prejudice, and it is factually wrong.\"</p> <p>OK then, I say, what percentage of Iceland's food would he describe as healthy? Silence. \"That isn't my concern.\" He's not concerned about selling high-calorie junk food to overweight people? He walks out again.</p> <p>When he reappears I ask if he's getting properly angry. \"Yeah, because you're just being a twat.\" I tell him I think he is just being disingenuous. \"You ask me if I'm concerned about the health of our customers. If I wasn't, we would not have done what we did in the way of cleaning up our products ahead of all the industry. Why have we done that? That's not to make money; there's a cost involved. And why did we get rid of all fridge freezers with CFCs 20 years ago?\"</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-422599055\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/11/15/1384528041943/Malcolm-Walker-in-1999-009.jpg\" alt=\"Malcolm Walker in 1999\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Iceland CEO Malcolm Walker in 1999. Photograph: Don Mcphee for the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I honestly don't know. That's what I'm trying to understand. If Walker were just another <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/shortcuts/2013/nov/08/michael-o-leary-33-daftest-quotes\" title=\"\">Michael O'Leary</a>, the Ryanair boss famous for his candid indifference to customers, there would be&#xa0;no confusion. O'Leary's version of a capitalist tycoon makes perfect sense; safety aside, he doesn't claim to care about anything except the bottom line. Walker is more complicated. He says he got rid of freezers containing CFCs, and most artificial additives, out of \"concern for the health of the nation\". In the next breath he adds, \"We're not here to make the world a better place, we are running a business to make a profit.\"</p> <p>He does not use zero-hours contracts, dismissing them as useful only to \"a despot running a minimum-wage, don't-give-a-shit-about-your-employees environment\", and when he saw what his own HR staff were making job applicants do, \"I was horrified. I said what the hell are we doing playing games? It was stupid, so I stopped it.\" And he pays his checkout staff more than any other high-street retailer except Tesco \u2013 \u00a37.75 an hour inside the M25, \u00a37.05 outside \u2013 with delivery drivers on \u00a38.80 and \u00a38.30. So why doesn't he pay the living wage? After all, he got rid of the CFCs in his fridge freezers simply because, he said at the time, it was \"the right thing to do\". So why not the living wage? He looks at me as if I must be mad. \"It would cost us \u00a39.5m. We can't just lop \u00a39.5m off our profits!\"</p> <p>I keep trying to tease out just where the line between profit and altruism lies for him, but by now he clearly thinks I am quite mad. \"You are a full-treatment socialist, aren't you? I can't believe it!\" he despairs, when I ask if he's ever thought about whether it is fair to have made so much from people who have so little. \"Do you think my staff earning \u00a38 an hour or whatever are resentful of the fact that I've got a nice car? No, of course they're not! And the staff we took by private jet to Monaco for their millionaire's weekend on my boat, did they resent it? No, they loved it! There is no resentment here, and why should there be? Because they know that without me they wouldn't have a job.\" My observation that he believes in trickle-down economics has him almost falling off his chair. \"It's not that I believe in it,\" he says incredulously. \"It is reality.\"</p> <p>When the photographer arrives I&#xa0;prepare to leave, but Walker has other ideas. \"We want to do a Saatchi,\" he tells him, plonking me down in a chair.

    "fields": {
      "standfirst": "The strong Australian dollar is the biggest drag on our competitiveness, not our lowest paid workers", 
      "body": "<p>On Monday this week Maurice Newman, the head of Tony Abbott\u2019s business advisory council, <a href=\"http://www.ceda.com.au/news-articles/2013/11/11/annualdinner\">gave a speech</a> examining Australia\u2019s fall in competitiveness over the past five years.</p> <p>It made a nice change from his writing on the<a href=\"http://www.afr.com/p/opinion/reorienting_australia_after_six_UX8hu630AD2pxERZeRnO5L\"> myth of climate change</a>, but it was no more informative. Rather than blame the high exchange rate, shockingly for a business leader, he found fault with our industrial relations system.</p> <p>Before looking at his precise complaints it\u2019s worth noting that the big problem with rising wages and competitiveness is if wages rise faster than productivity growth. This would, in effect, mean workers would be getting paid more to produce less. Were this to happen, labour\u2019s share of the national income would grow and the share going to capital would fall.</p> <p>And yet, as even<a href=\"http://www.economist.com/news/finance-and-economics/21588900-all-around-world-labour-losing-out-capital-labour-pains\"> The Economist has recently noted</a>, throughout the world labour is losing out to capital. And Australia is no exception \u2013 indeed, in the past decade, among the OECD, Australian labour\u2019s share of national income has fallen by the fifth largest percentage:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"grogonomics\">  <iframe src=\"https://charts.datawrapper.de/U0UxH/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"480\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>So right off the bat Newman\u2019s attack on Australian wages doesn\u2019t pass the smell test.</p> <p>But the real target of his speech was those on minimum wage. He compared Australia\u2019s minimum wage with other nations such as Canada, the US and New Zealand, and expressed dismay that it was so much higher, noting \u201cwe cannot hide from the fact that Australian wage rates are very high by international standards\u201d.</p> <p>He is certainly right \u2013 among OECD nations, our minimum wage is the third highest in US dollar purchasing power parity terms.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"grogonomics\">  <iframe src=\"https://charts.datawrapper.de/pPRyr/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"480\" height=\"480\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>So QED? Well not quite.</p> <p>Firstly, this is no new thing. Among the OECD nations, in 1993 Australia had the third highest minimum wage; in 2003 it was the fourth highest. Rather unsurprisingly, the ten nations with the ten highest minimum wages in 1993 are the same ten now.</p> <p>Moreover if we\u2019re worried about our international competitiveness, the minimum wage is an odd place to look. The industries with the highest proportion of workers on the minimum wage are accommodation and food services.

      "bodyText": "On Monday this week Maurice Newman, the head of Tony Abbott\u2019s business advisory council, gave a speech examining Australia\u2019s fall in competitiveness over the past five years. It made a nice change from his writing on the myth of climate change, but it was no more informative. Rather than blame the high exchange rate, shockingly for a business leader, he found fault with our industrial relations system. Before looking at his precise complaints it\u2019s worth noting that the big problem with rising wages and competitiveness is if wages rise faster than productivity growth. This would, in effect, mean workers would be getting paid more to produce less. Were this to happen, labour\u2019s share of the national income would grow and the share going to capital would fall. And yet, as even The Economist has recently noted, throughout the world labour is losing out to capital. And Australia is no exception \u2013 indeed, in the past decade, among the OECD, Australian labour\u2019s share of national income has fallen by the fifth largest percentage: So right off the bat Newman\u2019s attack on Australian wages doesn\u2019t pass the smell test. But the real target of his speech was those on minimum wage. He compared Australia\u2019s minimum wage with other nations such as Canada, the US and New Zealand, and expressed dismay that it was so much higher, noting \u201cwe cannot hide from the fact that Australian wage rates are very high by international standards\u201d. He is certainly right \u2013 among OECD nations, our minimum wage is the third highest in US dollar purchasing power parity terms. So QED? Well not quite. Firstly, this is no new thing. Among the OECD nations, in 1993 Australia had the third highest minimum wage; in 2003 it was the fourth highest. Rather unsurprisingly, the ten nations with the ten highest minimum wages in 1993 are the same ten now. Moreover if we\u2019re worried about our international competitiveness, the minimum wage is an odd place to look. The industries with the highest proportion of workers on the minimum wage are accommodation and food services. At best you could say it has some impact on our international tourism industry, but it\u2019d be a fairly big stretch to say the level of our minimum wage is the determining factor of being able to entice foreign tourists. Similarly of the next six industries with the highest number of workers on minimum wage, only the retail sector (with 25.6%) is at all trade exposed. The manufacturing sector has only 11.3% on the minimum wage and the mining sector has a mere 0.6% of workers taking home the minimum wage of $622.20 a week. And yet because our minimum wage has actually fallen compared to the average of OECD nations over the past decade (from US$4.08 higher in 2003 to US$3.83 in 2012), these sectors are being rendered no less competitive now by the minimum wage than they were in 2003 (or 1993 for that matter). Newman also suggested that the industrial regulations system needed to be fixed because it is \u201cdogged by rigidities\u201d. This is the kind of talk that had business leaders and conservative newspaper columnists warn of wages blowouts owing to the Fair Work Act \u2013 even before the ALP took power in 2007. Rather inconveniently for them, yesterday the latest wage price index figures released by the ABS showed the lowest annual increase in worker\u2019s wages since the ABS began publishing the wages index in 1998: Were the industrial relation system \u201cdogged by rigidities,\u201d wages would not fall in line in this way following the drop in the demand for labour we have seen in the past 12 months. So what is the biggest hit to our competitiveness? The exchange rate. Quite simply our nominal currency has risen against other currencies. Partly this has been the result of the mining boom, but mostly it\u2019s because of the very weak US dollar. In January 2009 one Australian dollar bought you US$0.65. Within two years you would get $US1.00 and since then the lowest it has fallen is $US0.89. Most of this movement is out of our hands \u2013 and has almost bugger all to do with our industrial relations system. On this Newman noted only, \u201cA lower exchange rate may help, but in any realistic scenario, it alone cannot make us competitive.\u201d Which is fine, except no one is saying that. In addition to the exchange rate, everyone knows we also need productivity growth if we wish our competitiveness and national income to improve. And yet, as I noted last week, when it comes to productivity, Australian workers for the past five years have been doing damn well (Newman oddly did not mention this). The ACTU\u2019s very good bulletin on productivity, released on Monday, compares our nominal exchange rate with the real rate that takes inflation into account. If prices and wages were rising faster than in other nations then that would hurt our competitiveness. It would see our real exchange rate rising faster than the nominal rate. But if you look over the past six years your see the two measures are almost glued together. Thus logically the reason for falling competitiveness is not wages rises, but our nominal exchange rate. Over the long term, a competitive Australia, where our national income continues to grow, require productivity growth \u2013 as it always has. It will require wages to grow in line with that productivity growth. Blaming the lowest paid workers and suggesting they need to take a pay cut because our exchange rate has gone up is only a solution if you are more interested in politics than economics.",
