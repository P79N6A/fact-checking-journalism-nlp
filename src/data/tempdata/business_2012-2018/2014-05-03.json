      "bodyText": "The attempt by US drugs group Pfizer to buy Britain's AstraZeneca in the biggest-ever foreign takeover of a UK firm has agitated workers, trade unions, politicians and scientists across the country. Emotions run particularly deep in the sleepy Kent town of Sandwich where, three years ago, Pfizer closed its world-renowned research lab \u2013 site of the discovery of Viagra \u2013 with the loss of more than 1,500 jobs. Pfizer has pledged that its proposed purchase of AstraZeneca, the UK's second-biggest pharmaceutical company after GlaxoSmithKline, will result in more British research, more scientific breakthroughs and more skilled UK jobs. Ian Read (see right), Pfizer's Scottish-born chief executive, last week promised the prime minister \"significant undertakings on research, jobs and investment\", and said \"key scientific leadership\" would be based here. \"We all know that's bullshit,\" said the manager of a once-thriving cafe in Sandwich's historic centre. \"They [Pfizer] had one of the best research centres in the world here, and they closed it. How can they close down here and just three years later say they are going to invest in Britain? Why isn't the prime minister asking that?\" The man, who declined to give his name, added: \"I don't trust them: no one here does. Astra'd better be careful. We all know takeovers mean big job cuts.\" Mark Moorhouse, a town councillor and chair of Sandwich Chamber of Commerce, said the loss of Pfizer's scientists was still \"very hard felt\", and that the day the US company announced its exit would be forever ingrained in the local psyche. \"It was the night of a council meeting to celebrate Sandwich's selection as the host of the 2011 Open Championship. Imagine that: the world's most prestigious golf competition coming to this little town. It should have been a fantastic party\u2026 but it was like a morgue.\" He said Pfizer's decision to close its Sandwich facility, which dated back 60 years, was \"like a death sentence\" for Sandwich and the area. \"It was so tragic \u2013 so much wonderful science went on in there and it was just closed. The site was important for the town. You are talking about 2,500 well-paid scientists, who spent a lot of money. There aren't a lot of well-paying jobs around here.\" (Following public and political outrage at the shutdown, Pfizer retained about 600 staff at the Sandwich site.) Sandwich pubs are still smarting from the collapse of the busy Friday night trade from Pfizer staff stopping for a drink on their way from the Ramsgate Road site to the station. Heather Lemoine, landlady of the Admiral Owen, which would be one of the first stops in a pub crawl from Pfizer's into town, said: \"It's been tragic since they left. All the pubs used to be rammed \u2013 you had to crawl to get in. Now, well, it's not the same now. They say they are going to invest in the UK. I'll believe that when I see it.\" John Bragg, a former Pfizer scientist and former mayor of Sandwich, who is currently a town councillor, said it was \"hugely odd\" that Pfizer was making a U-turn on British scientific research so soon after closing down his old lab. Bragg, who set up Pfizer's first non-US lab in Sandwich in 1955, said: \"I was very disappointed when Pfizer pulled out: it had a huge effect on the town. It's quite a paradox that now they want to come back to Britain.\" Pfizer's plan is for a combined Pfizer-Astra research centre in Cambridge \u2013 not Sandwich, where its site has been converted into a business park. AstraZeneca, which is relocating its research centre from Cheshire to Cambridge, has rejected Pfizer's overtures \u2013 including an increased \u00a363bn bid last Friday \u2013 as hugely undervaluing the business. David Cameron has asked his top civil servants to look for a way to make Pfizer keep its promise. US giant Kraft reneged on a pledge to keep a Cadbury factory in Bristol open soon after it took over the chocolate maker in 2010. But Downing Street has made it clear that the prime minister is not about to intervene in the deal, which is viewed as a commercial transaction between the companies and shareholders. And in any case, the government has little power over such deals: a proposed \"Cadbury law\" to protect British business was rejected by the Takeover Panel. Political heavyweights including Lord Heseltine and Lord Sainsbury have urged the government to act. Heseltine said last Friday: \"There are so many issues about the science base, the supply chains and employment prospects that ought to be explored. I don't see any way this can be adequately done unless the government has reserve powers.\" Sainsbury, who was science minister under Tony Blair, described Pfizer's promises as \"frankly meaningless\" and called on Cameron to block the deal. David Willetts, the current science minister, said he had had \"very tough-minded\" talks with Pfizer and emphasised the importance of it maintaining R&amp;D and management in the UK: \"I think those messages are getting home to Pfizer, but there's a lot more hard-headed negotiation to come.\" Shadow business secretary Chuka Umunna accused the government of being in league with Pfizer, and said the deal was driven by the US firm's desire to avoid tax. Pfizer has publicly said the deal would come with substantial tax benefits, including shielding the group's non-US earnings from American tax. The chairs of both the Commons business and the science select committees have called for investigations to ensure that jobs and Britain's position at the forefront of scientific research are safe. Andrew Miller MP, chair of the science and technology committee, said: \"Where the national interest is at stake the government shouldn't be so tardy in ensuring our interests are protected. I welcome foreign investment, but in the context of this takeover, I want to be convinced that this is the national interest.\" Miller said Pfizer's closure of its Sandwich lab \"obviously gives the whole of this a flavour that makes one suspicious of the commitments given\". He said he was not implacably opposed to the deal, but added: \"I want people to take one step back and examine what this means for our science base and for our R&amp;D, and make sure there are positive answers.\" Adrian Bailey MP, chair of the business select committee, said AstraZeneca's position in the UK economy \u2013 accounting for 2.3% of goods exports and employing more than 7,000 people \u2013 meant \"the stakes could not be higher\" and called for an investigation. Pfizer's record of buying companies then cutting thousands of jobs is also worrying unions. The firm has made a string of acquisitions since 2000, including Warner-Lambert for $90bn, Wyeth for $68bn and Sweden's Pharmacia for $60bn. The deals brought Pfizer an extra 134,000 employees, but its overall headcount only increased by some 27,000. Not all 100,000-plus job reductions were from sacking workers as Pfizer spun off various businesses, but job cuts are a big part of the company's strategy. Allan Black, national officer of the GMB union, said: \"Pfizer comes to the table with a poor reputation for post-acquisition behaviour. Our American trade union colleagues have a very jaundiced view of their behaviour in the US.\" Len Carlson, 76, propping up the bar in the Red Cow near Sandwich's forlorn market on Thursday afternoon, agreed: \"They [Pfizer] ruined Sandwich, don't let them ruin Astra too.\"",

I don't see any way this can be adequately done unless the government has reserve powers.\"</p> <p>Sainsbury, who was science minister under Tony Blair, described Pfizer's promises as \"frankly meaningless\" and called on Cameron to block the deal.</p> <p>David Willetts, the current science minister, said he had had \"very tough-minded\" talks with Pfizer and emphasised the importance of it maintaining R&amp;D and management in the UK: \"I think those messages are getting home to Pfizer, but there's a lot more hard-headed negotiation to come.\"</p> <p>Shadow business secretary Chuka Umunna accused the government of being in league with Pfizer, and said the deal was driven by the US firm's desire to avoid tax. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/apr/28/pfizer-astrazeneca-takeover-tax-benefits\" title=\"\">Pfizer has publicly said the deal would come with substantial tax benefits, including shielding the group's non-US earnings from American tax.</a></p> <p>The chairs of both the Commons business and the science select committees have called for investigations to ensure that jobs and Britain's position at the forefront of scientific research are safe.</p> <p>Andrew Miller MP, chair of the science and technology committee, said: \"Where the national interest is at stake the government shouldn't be so tardy in ensuring our interests are protected. I welcome foreign investment, but in the context of this takeover, I want to be convinced that this is the national interest.\"</p> <p>Miller said Pfizer's closure of its Sandwich lab \"obviously gives the whole of this a flavour that makes one suspicious of the commitments given\".</p> <p>He said he was not implacably opposed to the deal, but added: \"I want people to take one step back and examine what this means for our science base and for our R&amp;D, and make sure there are positive answers.\"</p> <p>Adrian Bailey MP, chair of the business select committee, said AstraZeneca's position in the UK economy \u2013 accounting for 2.3% of goods exports and employing more than 7,000 people \u2013 meant \"the stakes could not be higher\" and called for an investigation.</p> <p>Pfizer's record of buying companies then cutting thousands of jobs is also worrying unions. The firm has made a string of acquisitions since 2000, including <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2000/feb/08/10\" title=\"\">Warner-Lambert for $90bn</a>, Wyeth for $68bn and Sweden's Pharmacia for $60bn. The deals brought Pfizer an extra 134,000 employees, but its overall headcount only increased by some 27,000. Not all 100,000-plus job reductions were from sacking workers as Pfizer spun off various businesses, but job cuts are a big part of the company's strategy.</p> <p>Allan Black, national officer of the GMB union, said: \"Pfizer comes to the table with a poor reputation for post-acquisition behaviour. Our American trade union colleagues have a very jaundiced view of their behaviour in the US.\"</p> <p>Len Carlson, 76, propping up the bar in the Red Cow near Sandwich's forlorn market on Thursday afternoon, agreed: \"They [Pfizer] ruined Sandwich, don't let them ruin Astra too.\"</p>",

      "bodyText": "A short, bald, bespectacled accountant, Ian Read doesn't look like the prime mover in a corporate coup d'etat, but that is how the 60-year-old Scot rose to the top of Pfizer. The man leading the charge to seize control of AstraZeneca has been at Pfizer for 36 years. He joined in 1978 after studying chemical engineering at Imperial College, then qualifying as a chartered accountant. He is an intensely private man and even basic biographical details are hard to find, but the soft-spoken Read rose steadily through the ranks to the top job \u2013 one that paid him $19m last year. But his tenure has not been without drama. In 2008 Read, now a US citizen, was head of Pfizer's pharma division and valued within the company for his steady, astute mind. He was also, reportedly, on the verge of quitting. Read's predecessor Jeff Kindler, appointed in 2006, had presided over years of underperformance at the pharmaceutical giant. An outsider brought in to shake up the company, he had proved a divisive boss. Pfizer's stock had fallen 35% by the time he was ousted in 2010. A lawyer by training, Kindler was general counsel for McDonald's before joining Pfizer, and had a reputation for driving employees hard. A scathing analysis of his last days in office by Fortune magazine said he would publicly berate executives, including Read, whose wife had urged him to quit. Kindler, however, was keen to keep him. Read, then in charge of businesses that accounted for 90% of Pfizer's sales, was elevated to the number two slot, and Kindler announced plans to make him chief operating officer. But Read remained unhappy and the two scrapped over control of Pfizer's powerful research and development arm. Read's steady approach and deep ties within the company won the day. His holiday home near Bonita Springs, Florida, is close to the homes of three Pfizer directors, including William Steere, the 1990s chief executive who oversaw the introduction of hit drugs including Lipitor, Viagra and Zoloft. Steere, once Kindler's biggest supporter, started backing Read as Pfizer's stock slumped. A boardroom coup followed and Kindler was ousted with a $23m payoff. After the aggressive outsider, the board plumped for his total opposite \u2013 the safe, steady Read. One of Pfizer's first moves after Kindler's defenestration was a \"Thank goodness it's Monday\" programme to try to restore morale. That said, swingeing job cuts at Pfizer have continued. But its shares are up more than 80%. Read's calm approach is evident even in his audacious bid for AstraZeneca. In a letter to David Cameron this week, Read promised to protect UK jobs and research should a deal be done. \"Clearly, predictability and stability ... are important factors to enable success,\" he wrote. They have been for him.",

    "webTitle": "Katie Bickerstaffe: the woman mixing things up at Dixons", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Posing with a food mixer and other kitchen appliances is probably not how most high-flying female executives would like to be photographed, having had to battle stereotypes about \"a woman's place\" to win their seat in the boardroom. But Katie Bickerstaffe, chief executive of Dixons's retail business in Britain and Ireland, is gamely hugging a red KitchenAid that matches her frock because such products are a key part of her plan to put women at the heart of the technology retailer's turnaround. In this revamped Currys/PC World store in Thurrock, gone are the grey product line-ups reminiscent of communist-era military parades; instead multicoloured kitchen bling is arranged in displays that borrow from the fashion world. From a trendy Bodum coffee pot to a bright green Smeg fridge or a \u00a31,900 Elica cooker hood that looks like a disco ball, the interior is more department store chic than retail park slog. Bickerstaffe, formerly boss of Kwik Save, has even borrowed the idea of a digital sales fixture from a similar set-up used by Burberry to sell bespoke raincoats. \"The historical idea was that it was a boys' world; but women and men are equally tech-savvy and want to buy technology,\" says Bickerstaffe, a mother of two young children who works a four-day week to see more of them. But the new-look store is not the only potential makeover at the owner of Currys and PC World. In the next few weeks we should learn whether Dixons will merge with Carphone Warehouse in a \u00a34bn deal that will turn it into a FTSE 100 powerhouse with close to 3,000 outlets and \u00a312bn in sales. A successful merger will propel Bickerstaffe even further into the limelight \u2013 although she is already one of only a handful of female board directors at Britain's top retailers. Women may make up about 60% of the retail industry's employees and 80% of its customers but they still struggle to make it into the upper echelons. Bickerstaffe concedes Dixons has assisted her and other women to balance motherhood and career by allowing people to work more flexibly. But she says: \"It's not about men and women: it's about being a decent employer. I don't believe sitting at a desk from seven to seven gets results. \"This is a hard-nosed, low-margin retail business in which we have got to get more growth. It is incredibly competitive. But there are different ways to crack the nut,\" she adds. An extra day off, Bickerstaffe says, gives her time to think about the big picture. \"What that day gives me is choice\u2026 These are very small things, but to take my kids to school gives me balance. That time lets me think about the big strategic things we do.\" Dixons's new strategy to pull in more women shoppers arises partly from a management overhaul. Three of the eight people on the UK management board and four of the six members of the commercial team are female. Having survived the electricals-market shakeout that saw the demise of long-term rival Comet and the retreat of US invader Best Buy in the last few years, Dixons is now using those women's insights to take on the likes of John Lewis and online upstart AO.com by giving shoppers a better experience. The strategy is helping to draw in upmarket brands that would once have given the stores the cold shoulder. They are helping to pay for demonstrators that encourage people to browse more, or evening events where customers are invited into kitchen departments to brush up their knife skills or pick up tips on Sunday roasting. Bickerstaffe is game for the task of dragging Dixons into the future, describing herself as \"relentless\" in pursuing further improvements. Dixons's problems partly stemmed from underinvestment during a tough period, as it fought to survive a bitter price war amid the emergence of sophisticated online competition. But the company also lost sight of the first law of retail: listen to your customers. Bickerstaffe recalls going in search of the customer research department when she arrived, only to find a solitary and dispirited chap. \"Five or seven years ago, people didn't talk about the customer in this organisation,\" she says. \"I hope today the business understands that every decision we make is about doing the right thing for customers so they will come back and spend more.\" To ensure the message gets through at all levels, store bonuses will not pay out if the team does not meet targets on customer service, even if they have achieved all their other targets. Bickerstaffe \u2013 who did a geography degree and an MBA before becoming a management trainee at Unilever and moving up through PepsiCo, Dyson, Somerfield and Kwik Save \u2013 compares retailing to the catering trade. \"A restaurant can have great food, can look lovely, but, if the waiter is rude, you will say 'I don't want to go back there',\" she says. But there is clearly plenty more work to do with AO.com on the attack. Bickerstaffe says a certain amount of insecurity about Dixons's position in the market is a \"tremendous asset\" as it drives a desire to do things better \u2013 \"and I am definitely talking about myself as well as the business on that\". Next item on the agenda is improving the shopping experience for consumer electronics such as laptops in the same way as kitchenware has been revamped. And then there are phones. At present, phones are sold via concessions run by Phones4U. It is not known whether that operator will remain a partner if the merger with Carphone Warehouse goes ahead, but Dixons is trying to improve its phone-sales service at a time when Vodafone and other networks are expanding their own store chains rapidly. Bickerstaffe explains the thinking behind the potential deal: \"So much happens through the phone. With the 'internet of things', your whole life is centred around your phone. In the future all the appliances we sell will be smart-enabled.\" \"It's too early to comment on how [the deal] will play out. But the customer has got to be able to choose all their technology in one place,\" she says.",

      "bodyText": "Any business appointing Paul Flowers to head its bank when he had limited financial experience \u2013 although apparently he ran a good meeting \u2013 is crying out for a shakeup of its management structure. And this week the Co-op Group will find out just what changes Lord Myners proposes in his long-awaited report. Myners, who will also appear before a Treasury Select committee, was brought in to reform the group and became the only independent director on a board of 20 members. Effectively he recommended tearing up the existing structure and replacing it with a plc-style model. But after facing huge opposition, the City grandee has already said he will resign at the annual meeting on 17 May, when the Co-op will vote on his proposals. Myners has already warned that the banks which have lent Co-op \u00a31.2bn could take a tougher stance if changes are not made. In the way of buses, the Myners report will come hard on the heels of one on the Co-op Bank by Sir Christopher Kelly, a former top civil servant. His report cited poor management, bad lending and a flawed culture, and concluded that it should never have merged with the Britannia building society. In a foretaste of what can be expected from Myners, it said: \"It is hard to avoid the conclusion that the group board, as constituted, was never likely to be able to exercise any form of effective shareholder oversight of its banking subsidiary.\" Over to you, your lordship. Barclays to set up a bad bank? Hasn't it already done that? Still with the banking sector, and it will be a busy week for Barclays. Just a few days after a shareholder rebellion on bonuses at its annual meeting and a warning that first-quarter profits would be lower than last year, the bank will give full details of the figures on Tuesday and two days later unveil the results of a strategic review. Chief executive Antony Jenkins will reportedly announce the creation of a \"bad bank\" \u2013 which wags have already suggested should be named \"Barclays\" \u2013 which will hold a range of underperforming assets it plans to run down or sell. The City seems to like the idea, with analysts at UBS saying it had been sceptical that Barclays's management had the desire or ability to tackle businesses not earning an adequate return. \"However, press reports that the group is considering setting up a non-core runoff unit\u2026 suggests that the balance of probabilities is now in favour of a more meaningful restructuring.\" Meanwhile, news that Skip McGee, Barclays's highly paid US boss, was skipping off has prompted speculation Jenkins may be planning a big overhaul of the investment banking business. Sainsbury's must gird its loins With discounters such as Aldi and Lidl snatching market share from the big four supermarkets, it is surely only a matter of time before a real price war begins. Last week struggling Morrisons moved a step closer when it slashed the prices of more than 1,200 products across its range. That is not a promising background for the announcement on Wednesday of Sainsbury's full-year results, the swansong of respected chief executive Justin King. Underlying profits are expected to have climbed from \u00a3756m to around \u00a3782m, but that could be as good as it gets for a while. The City is forecasting that figure will fall to \u00a3767m next year. So all eyes will be on what King \u2013 or his successor, Michael Coupe \u2013 says about the prospect of a price war and any change in strategy. Mike Dennis at Cantor Fitzgerald says: \"We believe Sainsbury's is not fully prepared for the fallout from Morrisons stance. Sainsbury might now need to find additional cost savings above \u00a3100m per annum, and reduce newbuild capital expenditure and new store opening costs to free up money to invest in selected category pricing.\" However, Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale said Sainsbury should put an even stronger focus on quality to help it stand out against competitors.",

      "bodyText": "It would be rather amusing if sleaze came to the rescue of the Conservative party. Consider the sequence of events: a Conservative MP resigns in a cash-for-questions affair; a vacancy is created; Nigel Farage, fearing electoral humiliation, declines to stand; and the superficial level of Ukip's apparent support becomes more apparent. I have only met the genial Mr Farage once; it was, strangely enough, at a pro-European occasion, organised by the now defunct Lehman Brothers. Messrs Cameron and Osborne must be hoping that Farage and his motley crew will go the same way as that firm. They are most certainly hoping that the British economy's return to what looks like a respectable rate of growth will enable them to pull off the confidence trick that is the essence of the chancellor's economic strategy. Curiously, the collapse of Lehman, followed by the near-demise of the entire financial system, was not unhelpful to the Tories. A crisis that was caused by the banks, resulting from the deregulation championed by the Thatcher governments of the 1980s, proved a perfect propaganda gift to the coalition. For the truth that dare not speak its name is that, in opposition, Cameron and Osborne supported Labour's spending levels, and the \"imprudence\" that Gordon Brown practised in the latter days of his chancellorship made a trivial contribution to the deficit of 11% of GDP inherited by the coalition in 2010. Nevertheless, the coalition has made hay with its repeated reference to \"Labour's mess\" and taken full advantage of former treasury chief secretary Liam Byrne's ill-advised joke \u2013 and it was a joke \u2013 that there was no money left. There was plenty of money left, and more available. Investors around the world were queuing up to put money into the UK, and the average maturity on British government debt was 14 years. Osborne's comparison of the British position to that of Greece was mischievous and wrong. The welcome news that the economy has finally been growing again after three years of \"flatlining\" does not alter the fact that the chancellor's economic strategy has been a lamentable failure. To hear him declaim, in that smug way of his, that the recovery is the consequence of his austerity policies would be funny if it were not so patently dishonest. My friend Lord Skidelsky, the distinguished biographer of Keynes, reminded an audience from the financial world recently of that classic fallacy post hoc, ergo propter hoc \u2013 which, loosely translated, means it is a mistake to conclude that because one event follows another, it was caused by the event that preceded it. To listen to the chancellor you would think that he inherited a stagnant economy and breathed life back into it. What he actually did was inherit an economy that was beginning to emerge from depression, and promptly took action to drive it back into depression. He did this partly by implementing a tight fiscal squeeze, and partly by going on and on about \"austerity\", thereby guaranteeing to lower those \"animal spirits\" that are necessary to encourage large and small companies alike to invest for the future. Use of the catchword \"austerity\" inevitably conjured up visions of postwar Britain. The comparison was absurd, because in those days Britain really was broke and there was, to coin a phrase, no alternative to a prolonged period of austerity. It is by now well known that the forecasts made in 2010, both for growth and deficit reduction, had to be continually revised over the following three years to take account of reality. True, the state of the banking system was hardly conducive to growth; but it was the height of economic folly to add, through deliberate policy actions, to the depressing influence of the financial sector with a combined fiscal and monetary squeeze. It sounds odd to talk of a monetary squeeze when interest rates were at rock bottom, but the point is that there was a huge contraction in credit and the stock of money. This was eventually counteracted via so-called \"quantitative easing\", a silly term that simply meant the monetary authorities were pumping money into the economy and trying to revive the market for credit in a way that should naturally accompany growth. We are now at a very interesting juncture. There is much talk about the need to rebalance the economy, but there is likely to be growing concern about the balance of fiscal and monetary policy. It is interesting that, with recent surveys from the CBI suddenly giving the impression that orders are booming, the former CBI economic director and now monetary policy committee member Ian McCafferty is hinting at the need for a tighter monetary policy. This is not at all what Governor Carney or Chancellor Osborne wish to hear, and with output still not back to the levels of 2008 \u2013 and some 20% below what it ought to be according to historical trends \u2013 the last thing one would want is action to stop the recovery in its tracks. Nevertheless, taken with all the concern about the level of asset prices, the commitment to keep interest rates so low for so long looks increasingly shaky. And this has implications for the wisdom, or not, of the continued fiscal squeeze planned by the chancellor: rebalancing would involve an easier fiscal stance.",

      "bodyText": "The beleaguered Co-operative Group has insisted that it wants a single major corporate buyer for its portfolio of British farms, and will not consider community buyouts. This dashes the hopes of green campaigners, who are calling the move a \"panic sale\" that leaves the way open for Chinese buyers to snap up the land. The Co-op announced at the end of February that it would be selling all of its 15 farms, a total of about 17,000 hectares (44,000 acres). Bids are due in by the end of this month. Estate agent Savills has been instructed not to give particulars to any potential buyer without a \"proven track record in acquisitions\". This weekend it wrote to a conglomerate of farmers \u2013 including Martin Large of the Biodynamic Land Trust \u2013 to clarify that there would be no consideration of community buyouts, even though groups are forming across the country to attempt to persuade the Co-op otherwise. It means swaths of British farmland will probably be snapped up by a Chinese investor or hedge fund speculator. Interest in UK farmland from such foreign investors is high at the moment, especially because of the threat of food insecurity. Critics of the sale say it will end more than 100 years of ethical farming by the Co-op in its farms and at three packhouses across England and Scotland that process cereals, fruit, vegetables and honey. The Farmers Weekly newspaper estimated that the sale of the land alone, without any added value from equipment or buildings, could bring in around \u00a3140m. This, critics say, will make barely a dent in the Co-op Group's \u00a32.5bn losses in the year to April 2014. Large said the decision to sell was a poor one. \"When you consider the sorry tale of the Co-op Group's recent leadership, one questions the wisdom of the distress firesale of the farms. Are the boys in the sweetshop now selling off the family silver to help pay for their spending spree? \"Community farm buyouts can and do work, as we are showing time and time again. Since 2006 over 1,000 community benefit societies have been successfully set up to save pubs, run village shops, develop community renewable energy and run farms. I recently helped to save Rush Farm near Redditch, Worcestershire, where we set up a society with community shares and loans. Rush Farm was where the original Archers programmes were made in the early 1950s. This community buyout shows just how popular preserving a working, farming countryside is.\" He went on: \"Savills and the Co-op Group refuse to send farm details because we are not proceedable or credible \u2013 we don't have the \u00a3200m guide price needed. Clearly, the Co-op prefers selling to hedge funds and speculators for the highest price. They ignore our proposed alternative of a community buyout and make it impossible by withholding commercial information and imposing a short timescale. The farms, built by Co-op management and workers, with members reinvesting profits over generations, will be lost as an asset.\" Professor Molly Scott Cato, a sustainability expert, economist and Green party candidate in this month's European elections, said she was horrified by the sale. \"There's a parallel here with Royal Bank of Scotland being owned by the taxpayer. If we own a bank, let's use it to make loans to small businesses, decentralise and help local communities. But no, the government says we must make it an untouchable financial institution just like it was when it failed. So the Co-op farms are owned by members who aren't allowed to use them as an asset to improve their lives, to meet their needs. They have to be sold as a corporate concern. \"The model we should be striving for in an unpredictable world is lots of local networks for food security, not one over-arching one. That's unstable.\" The Co-op said the move was \"not driven by the need to realise cash because of the issues at the bank or the underperformance of any other parts of the business\". It said proceeds would go to the group, which is owned by its 7.2 million members, although it admitted they had not been consulted on the sale. A spokesman for the group told the Observer they believed a single buyer would best preserve the jobs of the 250 people employed on the farms. He said: \"As part of the wider strategic review of all of its businesses, the Co-operative Group has decided that its farms are non-core. The sale was decided as a result of this and acting in the best long term interests of the group. A new owner will be able to provide the farms business with sustainable support to develop it for the future. Our primary focus is to sell the whole business as a going concern, which creates opportunities for our colleagues and a sustainable business for the future.\" Phil Hudson of the NFU, who has been in talks with the retailer about the impact of the decision, said: \"This is a really disappointing decision by the Co-op. From our perspective now it is important that we get some assurances from the retail side that they will continue with the strong links they have built up with British farming.\" The Co-op shops have a commitment to sourcing 100% British milk, eggs, beef, pork and dairy. In a similar way to central London property, farmland is now seen as a safe bet by foreign investors \u2013 while the average value of prime residential property in London has grown by 135% over the last decade, the value of prime British farmland has increased 273% to an average price of \u00a38,500 per acre, according to Savills.",

Rush Farm was where the original <em>Archers</em> programmes were made in the early 1950s. This community buyout shows just how popular preserving a working, farming countryside is.\"</p> <p>He went on: \"Savills and the Co-op Group refuse to send farm details because we are not proceedable or credible \u2013 we don't have the \u00a3200m guide price needed. Clearly, the Co-op prefers selling to hedge funds and speculators for the highest price. They ignore our proposed alternative of a community buyout and make it impossible by withholding commercial information and imposing a short timescale. The farms, built by Co-op management and workers, with members reinvesting profits over generations, will be lost as an asset.\"</p> <p>Professor Molly Scott Cato, a sustainability expert, economist and Green party candidate in this month's European elections, said she was horrified by the sale. \"There's a parallel here with Royal Bank of Scotland being owned by the taxpayer. If we own a bank, let's use it to make loans to small businesses, decentralise and help local communities. But no, the government says we must make it an untouchable financial institution just like it was when it failed. So the Co-op farms are owned by members who aren't allowed to use them as an asset to improve their lives, to meet their needs. They have to be sold as a corporate concern.</p> <p>\"The model we should be striving for in an unpredictable world is lots of local networks for food security, not one over-arching one. That's unstable.\"</p> <p>The Co-op said the move was \"not driven by the need to realise cash because of the issues at the bank or the underperformance of any other parts of the business\". It said proceeds would go to the group, which is owned by its 7.2 million members, although it admitted they had not been consulted on the sale. A spokesman for the group told the <em>Observer</em> they believed a single buyer would best preserve the jobs of the 250 people employed on the farms.</p> <p>He said: \"As part of the wider strategic review of all of its businesses, the Co-operative Group has decided that its farms are non-core. The sale was decided as a result of this and acting in the best long term interests of the group. A new owner will be able to provide the farms business with sustainable support to develop it for the future. Our primary focus is to sell the whole business as a going concern, which creates opportunities for our colleagues and a sustainable business for the future.\"</p> <p>Phil Hudson of the NFU, who has been in talks with the retailer about the impact of the decision, said: \"This is a really disappointing decision by the Co-op. From our perspective now it is important that we get some assurances from the retail side that they will continue with the strong links they have built up with British farming.\"</p> <p>The Co-op shops have a commitment to sourcing 100% British milk, eggs, beef, pork and dairy.</p> <p>In a similar way to central London property, farmland is now seen as a safe bet by foreign investors \u2013 while the average value of prime residential property in London has grown by 135% over the last decade, the value of prime British farmland has increased 273% to an average price of \u00a38,500 per acre, according to Savills.</p>",
