This show has been running for a quarter of a century, mostly to negative reviews, and John McFarlane is the latest chairman to believe he can learn from his predecessors\u2019 mistakes. On the face of it, Jes Staley, a 30-year veteran of JP Morgan, sounds a plausible pick as chief executive. Not all American investment bankers are alike and Staley\u2019s style sounds the opposite of Bob Diamond\u2019s brash approach (though one assumes the new man will want to be paid the traditional megabucks). But McFarlane would do his shareholders a service if he set out a few principles at the outset. If you hire an investment banker as boss, you clearly want to do some investment banking. How big does Barclays want to be in the field? Back in July, at the interim figures, McFarlane said \u201cit\u2019s not our obligation\u201d to build a European champion to compete with the big Wall Street firms, but lately he\u2019s been suggesting it would be a fine thing if somebody accepted the challenge. European regulators and politicians, runs this argument, should take another look at the capital and bonus restrictions that have created a playing field which favours the Americans. But what if regulators won\u2019t cooperate? Would Barclays sell its investment bank (the US bank Wells Fargo is the perennial name suggested) or would it carry on regardless in the hope that favourable winds will appear one day? The strategy is unclear, just as it was under the deposed chief executive Antony Jenkins. The intended appointment of a successor with no experience in retail banking adds to the confusion. AB InBev deal is bitter for beer fans In the end, Jan du Plessis folded in the limp manner of most big company chairmen. The board he leads at SABMiller has accepted Anheuser-Busch InBev\u2019s \u00a344-a-share offer, a price about \u00a32 short of an honourable surrender. So much for the idea that last week\u2019s offer of \u00a342.15 was a \u201cvery substantial undervaluation.\u201d Du Plessis\u2019s words were tactical bluster. A bump of a mere 4.4% will pave the way for the monopolistic Megabrew to come into being, enough to make self-respecting drinkers gulp something stronger than a bottle of the bidder\u2019s bland Budweiser. It is possible, of course, to sympathise with the position du Plessis found himself in. His 27% shareholder, the Marlboro cigarette firm Altria, was lobbying for the deal from the off and liked AB InBev\u2019s tax-friendly share alternative. The San Domingo family from Colombia stayed loyal but its 14% stake was an inadequate counterweight. Many of the floating voters in the middle \u2013 unsentimental City fund managers eyeing their end-of-year performance statistics \u2013 didn\u2019t want the deal to collapse. They, like everyone else, can see that currencies, especially the South African rand, have moved against SAB. Sadly, they will regard \u00a344, plus a dividend that could be worth 80p a share, as a tidy outcome. And a $3bn (\u00a32bn) break-fee, to be paid if AB InBev walks away before completion, is undoubtedly chunky. Here, though, we take an old-fashioned view of a chairman\u2019s responsibilities. Big shareholders\u2019 views have to be respected, but a chairman is not there to be an echo. Du Plessis could have offered his own view of the wisdom of a deal that offers nothing for SAB\u2019s employees, customers and suppliers. He could have forced AB InBev to come clean on the extent of its cost-cutting ambitions. And even if Altria was a lost cause, he could have appealed for greater loyalty from other long-term shareholders who have done superbly over the years by owning SAB stock. Instead, du Plessis and co have bowed before a takeover premium that is not as pretty as its 50% headline suggests (it is more like 33% if you take the three-month average of SAB\u2019s share price before AB InBev made its first move). The board has done what the City expected, in other words. No wonder the announcement from SAB didn\u2019t even try to argue that a takeover is good for staff or beer drinkers. The short answer is that it\u2019s not. Post-haste over Royal Mail shares Farewell, then, to the state\u2019s last shares in Royal Mail. We got 455p a pop for the last 13% parcel, which looks good against the 330p privatisation price from 2013, but not so clever when you remember that 600p was seen briefly in early 2014. Perfect timing is impossible, of course, but remember the explanation the previous government gave for declining to exploit the initial \u201cfroth\u201d in the share price: it was because the state intended to be a supportive long-term minority investor. That was an expensive statement.",

      "bodyText": "The closure of Redcar steelworks (Report, 13 October) shows the importance of boosting energy productivity to tackle high energy costs. Over half (54%) of the energy used in electricity is lost before it even reaches us, and is worth \u00a39.5bn annually \u2013 enough to pay half the electricity bill of every home in Britain. Wasted energy reduces our productivity and undermines efforts to create a competitive, modern economy. With energy costs on an upward trajectory and ever tightening carbon budgets, urgent action is needed. New analysis identifies how to cut much of this waste and save bill payers more than \u00a33.9bn a year. How? By focusing on a best-value energy policy, improving energy productivity and giving businesses a simple policy to leverage investments in energy efficiency. Unlocking energy productivity will strengthen the economy and protect jobs. Carbon emissions will decline. The environmental impact of new energy infrastructure will reduce. Energy costs will go down. Businesses will be able to do more with less. As the secretary of state for energy and climate change, Amber Rudd, approaches her planned energy policy \u201creset\u201d and the comprehensive spending review, now is the right time to transform this wasteful inefficiency into a huge growth opportunity for the UK economy. Dr Tim Rotheray Director, Association for Decentralised Energy Dr Joanne Wade Director, Association for the Conservation of Energy Matt Thomson Head of planning, Campaign for the Protection of Rural England Nick Mead President, Chartered Institution of Building Services Engineers David Workman Director general, Confederation of Paper Industries Louise Kingham Chief executive, Energy Institute and seven others (full list at gu.com/letters) Martin Fry Chairman, Energy Services and Technology Association Steve Reeson Head of climate change and energy policy, Food and Drink Federation Doug Parr Chief scientist and policy director, Greenpeace Sheila Wren Advocacy officer, John Muir Trust Dr Richard Leese Director, energy and climate change, Mineral Products Association Simon Marsh Head of sustainable development, Royal Society for the Protection of Birds \u2022 So the government has rejected an appeal for help to keep the Redcar steelworks in Teesside open with the loss of 2,200 jobs in the area. This will have a devastating effect on the local economy and communities and is yet another example of the government\u2019s hypocrisy. David Cameron is keen to push for shale gas in the UK at any cost, and one of the carrots that he offers us is the possibility of tens of thousands of jobs created as a result of the development of the fracking industry. A 2014 report by Ernst &amp; Young, Getting Ready for UK Shale Gas, states that more than 12,600km of steel well casings worth over \u00a32.3bn will need to be purchased in order to drill the thousands of wells proposed over the next 15 years. Enough, they say, to go from John O\u2019Groats to Land\u2019s End nine times. So, where will the steel be purchased? Methinks from George Osborne\u2019s new friends in China.

      "bodyText": "US consumers are expecting lower growth in earnings and household spending, according to a survey from the New York Federal Reserve. The September report shows stable inflation expectations, but earnings growth and spending growth fell sharply from the month before. Spending growth is more than a percentage point below its June 2015 level and has reached a new low since the survey began in June 2013. A little more evidence to perhaps help persuade the US Federal Reserve to keep interest rates on hold this year. On that note it\u2019s time to close up for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back again tomorrow. More on the Irish Budget from Henry McDonald in Dublin: As is now customary since the financial crash in 2008 and the wave of anti-Austerity protests that rocked European capitals over the last few years the Garda Siochana on budget day have erected steel securtiy barriers at the street leading towards Leinster House, the home of the Irish parliament in Dublin. This afternoon there were just eight protestors behind the barricades, four of whom were not there protesting about the budget. A sign of the times perhaps that, in Ireland at least, the rage against the wave of austerity has somewhat receded. Opposition politicians will warn that the Irish people will pay back the Coalition, particularly the Labour Party, in the privacy of the ballot box when the general election is officially called. All the smart money now is on Enda Kenny waiting until the early spring, when today\u2019s budget measures should have started to impact on people\u2019s wages and spending power. With tax cuts, a rise in the minimum wage, a partial increase in public spending, decreases in some motor taxes and more cash for vital sectors of the electorate like pensioners, the Fine Gael-Labour government will be hoping Budget 2016 will be rewarded with a second term in office for the coalition. Renewed worries about the Chinese economy after the country revealed a poor set of trade data - with imports down around 20% year on year - helped send European stock markets into the red again. On top of that, German confidence figures also disappointed, perhaps not a surprise given the continuing emissions scandal at Volkswagen and its effect on the German economy as a whole. Commodity stocks were under pressure after the Chinese data, but the agreed bid for SABMiller helped limit some of the damage to the UK market. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished down 28.90 points or 0.45% at 6342.28 Germany\u2019s Dax dropped 0.94% to 10,024.27 France\u2019s Cac closed 1.1% lower at 4637.23 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB fell 0.19% to 22,048.49 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended 1.38% lower at 10,104.7 In Greece the Athens market slipped 0.36% to 678.30 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up just 12 points or 0.07%. After leaving US interest rates on hold in September, the Federal Reserve would find it difficult to raise borrowing costs this month. That is the view of St Louis Federal Reserve president James Bullard, who in fact opposed the decision to delay raising rates in September. But he said the data released since the last meeting was unlikely to persuade other policymakers to sanction a move when they meet in two weeks. Indeed the recent non-farm payroll numbers proved to be well below expectations. Bullard said (quotes from Reuters): It is very tough for the committee to make a big decision and then change it after only one meeting. Roughly speaking the data has not been that different from what would have been expected, and the jobs report was weaker. In the last budget the Fine Gael-Labour government announced the abolition of the controversial \u201cdouble Irish\u201d tax avoidance scheme. This arrangement allowed multinationals to reduce their tax bill far below Ireland\u2019s 12.5% corporate tax rate by shifting most of their taxable income from an operating company in Ireland to another Irish-registered firm in an offshore tax haven such as Bermuda. To keep global corporations happy and willing to remain in Ireland, Noonan announced the introduction of a \u201cKnowledge Development Box\u201d (KDB) lower tax. Foreign firms who invest in research and development in the Republic will only pay 6.25% corporation tax. This will only apply to income earned through KDB. The \u201cdouble Irish\u201d arrangement which was introduced in the 1980s to woo the likes of Apple to Ireland came under fire the US Senate and Ireland\u2019s EU partners, particularly the French. France has also been critical of Ireland\u2019s overall low 12.5% corporation tax. However, there was no sign nor will there be in the foreseeable future of any Irish government altering this 12.5% rate. Irish Finance Minister Michael Noonan has been on his feet delivering Budget 2016 for the Republic, writes Henry McDonald in Dublin. He has been addressing a very sombre Dail which prior to the budget being laid out heard tributes led by Taoiseach Enda Kenny for the 10 people who lost their lives in the fire in South County Dublin last Saturday and then 24 hours later the murder of an Irish police officer in County Louth. After a minutes silence to remmeber the victims Noonan opened his budget speech by referring to 2016, the centenary year of the Easter Rising against British rule. He said the anniversary gave Ireland \u201cthe chance to reflect\u201d on how far Ireland has come especially in recent years and how the state had faced up to the financial crash, the bail out and the recession. Noonan\u2019s headline give-away measure was a series of tax cuts totalling \u20ac750m which in part will be financed by a 50 cents rise in the price of a 20 pack of cigarettes. The Finance Minister then laid out examples of how these tax cuts including slashing the hated Universal Social Charge (brought in to appease the IMF-EU during the bail out) would affect different families. These included: *A single person, working full time on the minimum wage, earning \u20ac17,542, will see an increase of 4.2 per cent (\u20ac708) a year * A family with three children with parents working as a Garda and a nurse earning \u20ac55,000 and \u20ac50,000 respectively will have an additional \u20ac196 per month in their pocket Given the importance of tourism in Ireland the Minister announced there will be no increase in the 9% VAT rate for the hospitality industry. For pensioners, that most critical band of voters in successive elections in the Republic, the Pension Levy (a tax on pension payments) will be phased out. These above measures are clearly designed to appeal to middle income earners, those in work, who suffered greatly during the years of austerity and the bail out when direct and indirect taxes shot up. US markets have fallen back in early trading, along with other global markets in the wake of poor Chinese trade figures, which cast new doubt over the prospects for the world\u2019s second largest economy. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is down more than 90 points or 0.5%, while European markets are also still firmly in the red. After the Treasury Select Committee heard from the newest member of the Bank of England\u2019s Monetary Policy Committee, Jan Vlieghe, who appeared in no hurry to vote for a rate rise, it was the turn of fellow rate-setter Ian McCafferty. McCafferty was the only one of the nine-member monetary policy committee (MPC) to vote for a hike last week. Katie Allen reports: McCafferty appeared less worried about the negative impact on the UK and the inflation outlook from a global economic slowdown. \u201cI place more weight on some of the upside domestic risks to to inflation over the three-year horizon,\u201d McCafferty told MPs. \u201cIt\u2019s clear that we have seen UK wages pick up relatively smartly in nominal terms over the course of the last six months, to a rate that is higher then the MPC would have expected six or nine months ago.\u201d He also expects a tightening labour market will mean nonimal wage growth accelerates further over 2016 and 2017 and that is something that will only be offset to \u201csome extent\u201d by a pick-up in productivity growth. McCafferty described himself as not hugley optimistic about productivity growth improving. Asked about the relative merits of using quantitative easing (QE) or changes in the Bank rate to influence the economy, McCafferty noted policymakers had more experience on Bnk rate. He also said he would like to see the Bank rate become an effective marginal instrument again. \u201cOver time, I would like to see Bank rate get up to a point at which we could cut it again were we to need to do so were the economy to slow or inflation to dip below target.\u201d The latest official figures showed inflation dipped into negative territory in September, at a rate of -0.1%. But McCaffterty sought to reassure MPs \u201cI do not think we are entering a form of deflation\u201d and noted there were few signs of changes in consumer behaviour as a result of stagnant prices. Asked whether the latest news on inflation might influence him, McCafferty said it would not. Nor would the latest warning about weaker global growth from the International Monetary Fund. \u201cIn isolation, those things would not on their own change my view of the last few months,\u201d he said. Dorsey\u2019s promise of no \u201ccorporate speak\u201d in his email to Twitter employees about the job cuts fell at pretty much the first hurdle: Over in California, Twitter has just announced plans to cut around 8% of its workforce. Jack Dorsey hasn\u2019t wasted much time since becoming CEO again. In a letter to staff, he says Twitter will \u201cpart ways\u201d with up to 336 workers in an attempt to grow faster. It\u2019s a tough decision, Dorsey says, but necessary as \u201cthe world needs a strong Twitter\u201d.... As usual, the sound of job cuts goes down well on Wall Street - Twitter shares have risen in pre-market trading. One of the bankers blamed for the financial crash in Ireland due to over-lending to property speculators faces extradition from the United States later today. David Drumm, a former senior figure in the now defunct Anglo Irish Bank, will appear in a court in Boston where he has been living in exile since the institution collapsed in 2009 and hundreds of millions of taxpayers money was spent to nationalise it. An American judge will decide today whether his arrest at the weekend in Massachusetts at the weekend was lawful. If the judge rules it was then this will pave the way for Drumm\u2019s extradition back to Ireland where he will face up to 33 criminal charges including seven counts of forgery and seven counts of falsifying documents. Drumm\u2019s re-appearance in the Irish media is a reminder on Ireland\u2019s Budget Day of the bad old days before the crash and the international bail out when bankers loaned billions to property speculators which in turn dangerous overstretched not only key business figures in Ireland but also overheated the Republic\u2019s economy. Our economics editor, Larry Elliott, has taken a look at today\u2019s UK inflation data, which showed prices were 0.1% cheaper in September than a year ago. We haven\u2019t seen such weak price pressure in the British economy for many decades, he points out: This is going to be a record-breaking year for UK inflation. Not since the interwar period has upward pressure on the cost of living been as persistently weak as it has since the start of 2015. But this is being driven by cheaper commodities, as emerging markets slow down. The Bank of England is therefore confronted with a situation in which the inflation rate for goods is currently -2.4% while the inflation rate for services is +2.5%. So what happens next? Larry reckons prices will pick up in 2016, pushing inflation back towards the 2% target. Unless the global economy sours.... The top 1% of wealth holders now own half of all household wealth. And that includes 120,000 \u201cultra-high net worth individuals\u201d across the globe who own at least $50m of wealth each. That\u2019s according to Credit Suisse\u2019s latest wealth report, which is packed with details about the distribution of wealth across the globe. This year\u2019s report shows that China\u2019s stock market boom has helped to create more ultra-rich people there. Chinese multimillionaires and billionaires make up 8% of all UHNWI\u2019s. The group of millionaires below the $50m mark make up another 0.7% of global population, but owns 45.2% of global wealth. But while the ultra rich have got even richer, others aren\u2019t keeping pace. Credit Suisse\u2019s chief executive Tidjane Thiam says: Notably, we find that middle-class wealth has grown at a slower pace than wealth at the top end. This has reversed the pre-crisis trend, which saw the share of middle-class wealth remaining fairly stable over time. Here are some charts from the report, which is online here. The top slice of this pyramid group is made up of 34 million US dollar millionaires, who comprise less than 1% of the world\u2019s adult population, yet own 45% of all household wealth. Credit Suisse estimates that 123,800 individuals within this group are worth more than $50m, and 44,900 have over $100m. UK parliament\u2019s Treasury Committee has been hearing from the newest member of the Bank of England\u2019s rate-setting Monetary Policy Committee, Jan Vlieghe, and it appears he is in no hury to vote for a hike. This is the first time financial markets are getting a chance to hear what the new MPC member thinks about the UK economy, the global outlook and what should come next for interest rates in the UK. After the Bank\u2019s chief economist, Andy Haldane, recently raised the prospect of a rate cut - from what is already a record low of 0.5% - in the face several risks to the economic outlook, Vlieghe too is not ruling out even lower borrowing costs. He is worried about the Bank meeting its government-set target for inflation at 2% on the consumer prices index (CPI), which fell to -0.1% this morning. Asked if the BoE had run out of tools, Vlieghe said \u201cwe can cut rates if we judge it necessary\u201d and that the Bank could also re-start its asset purchase programme, also known as quantitative easing (QE). But he did also say \u201cthe next move in interest rates is more likely to be up than down.\u201d Vlieghe highlighted what he saw as risks to the UK from China\u2019s downturn and the wider global slowdown. \u201cClearly, the UK is an open economy, it has very important trade and financial links to the rest of the world. The UK is in reasonably good shape, growth is solid but not fantastic. But we absolutely have to take into account we are operating in a global environment which is adverse, so to speak, and it\u2019s a headwind to growth and it is one of the things that will prevent, I think, the UK economy from accelerating meaningfully from the pace we are seeing currently.\u201d He set out some upsides and downsides in the current domestic situation. The \u201cheadwinds\u201d were: A strong pound That the UK is operating in a weak global environment An ongoing fiscal headwind: But on the plus side: There had been some improvement to productivity growth A housing market recovery Some improvement in real wages \u201cWhat we are trying to judge is how these play off against each other,\u201d Vlieghe added. As for when he might vote for rates to go higher, after already more than six years at their record low, the former hedge fund economist highlighted a host of low inflation numbers from the core rate to people\u2019s inflation expectations. Speaking after official figures showed headline inflation turned negative in September, Vlieghe said other prices indicators too were \u201call a little bit below where you\u2019d want them to be to be confident of meeting the 2% inflation target in the medium term\u201d. \u201cWe need them to rise... I am not confident enough right now that they will rise in order to vote for an immediate rate hike. I think we have time. We can wait and see how this plays out and I would want to see a more convincing broad-based upward trajectory before I say OK, now I am confident enough that we will get to 2% eventually and therefore vote for a rate rise.\u201d Despite the evidence of today\u2019s ZEW survey, German economy minister Sigmar Gabriel has claimed the diesel emissions scandal at Volkswagen won\u2019t permanently damage the German economy. Asked whether the VW crisis would hit the economic outlook for Germany, Europe\u2019s largest economy, Gabriel said: \u201cNo, I don\u2019t expect the problems at Volkswagen to have lasting effects on the German economy.\u201d It may be too early to be sure, though. Yesterday, Britain\u2019s transport secretary said Volkswagen deserves to suffer \u201csubstantial damage\u201d because of the diesel emissions scandal. Patrick McLoughlin told MPs that: \u201cThey have behaved in an appalling way,\u201d \u201cThese [defeat] devices were made illegal in 1998 and it is unbelievable to think a company the size and reputation of VW have been doing something like this. They are going to suffer very substantial damage as a result and they deserve to.\u201d For the first time in seven years an Irish budget will actually be giving away something for its citizens after the years of tax hikes, brutal spending cuts, the humiliation of an IMF-EU bail out and the crash of the Celtic Tiger. Irish Finance Minister Michael Noonan will get to his feet after 2pm inside the Dail and deliver a budget that is expected to include: An increase in \u20ac3 to the weekly Old Age Pension Tax cuts for the average worker that are expected to put \u20ac1000 back into their pockets A cut of to the hated Universal Social Charge tax which was brought in to help plug the gap in public finances during the bail out times. A \u20ac550 tax credit for the self-employed The promise of 20,000 new public homes taken from the portfolio of properties nationalised after the financial crash and the bankruptcies of property speculators. Increases in child benefits and a freeze on prescription charges. Of course it is hardly a coincidence that the Fine Gael-Labour goverment are facing into an election year in 2016 and will no doubt face accusations from opposition parties of trying to bribe their way back into power. In return the coalition will argue that they have done the \u201cheavy lifting\u201d after four years in office, carried out the painful adjustment policies that restored the nation\u2019s finances and oversaw growth in the economy, and managed an exit from the bail out. One thing is for sure - Enda Kenny and his administration are going to wait for at least three months before today\u2019s budget measures sink into the public\u2019s consciousness. The Taoiseach has finally decided that he won\u2019t call the election until late February/early March. The wisdom of that decision to go late rests an awful lot on the impact of today\u2019s Budget 2016. The Volkswagen diesel emissions scandal and economic problems in emerging markets have become a toxic cocktail for confidence within Germany, new data shows. Morale among German investors and analysts fell sharply in October, according to the ZEW think tank, pulling its economic sentiment index down from 12.1 to just 1.9. ZEW President Professor Clemens Fuest pinned the blame on VW, and troubles overseas: \u201cThe exhaust gas scandal of Volkswagen and the weak growth of emerging markets has dampened economic outlook for Germany.\u201d ZEW\u2019s assessment of the current situation in Germany also fell, by 12.3 points to 55.2 points. Despite that, Fuest reckons Germany will not fall back into recession. For the survey, ZEW asked analysts and institutional investors about their current assessment of the economic situation in Germany, as well as their expectations for the coming months. Over in Germany, Volkswagen has just announced that it is cutting its investment programme by \u20ac1bn per year, as it grapples with the fallout from the diesel emissions scandal. In a statement just released, VW announced a range of changes including shifting all its diesel cars to cleaner exhaust emissions systems, and making the next generation of its Phaeton car run on electricity.. Dr. Herbert Diess, who runs Volkswagen\u2019s Passenger Brand, says: \u201cThe Volkswagen brand is repositioning itself for the future. We are becoming more efficient, we are giving our product range and our core technologies a new focus, and we are creating room for forward-looking technologies by speeding up the efficiency program.\u201d Here\u2019s the key points from VW\u2019s new strategic plan: Accelerated implementation of the efficiency program creates room for reorientation Streamlined processes leverage further cost-saving potential, including cuts in fixed costs Investments to be reduced by 1 billion euros per year compared with planning \u2013 combined with prioritization of projects for the future \u2022 Product decisions formulated \u2022 New Phaeton will be electric \u2022 New Modular Electric Toolkit planned Over in parliament, MPs are beginning to quiz former hedge-fund economist Gertjan Vlieghe about his appointment to Britain\u2019s Monetary Policy Committee. You can see it here. It could be quite tasty, as explained earlier.... September\u2019s inflation rate is used to calculate a range of benefits payments in the UK. Consumer expert Paul Lewis reports that these payments will now be frozen, as will other payments linked to the headline inflation rate. Britain\u2019s return to negative inflation isn\u2019t a great surprise or a great calamity, says Jeremy Cook, chief economist at the international payments company, World First: He reckons inflation will pick up sharply in 2016, once the recent slump in oil prices fades into history. Headline inflation has been pressured for nearly a year now from falling energy and commodity prices but we must remember that base effects will see that initial drop in oil prices fall out of the calculations in the coming months. Howard Archer of IHS Global Insight also sees UK interest rates on hold for longer. With inflation back below zero, it\u2019s hard to see Britain\u2019s interest rates rising from their current record low before 2016. Peter Cameron, Associate Fund Manager at EdenTree Investment Management, explains: \u201cInflation is back in negative territory again and it\u2019s very unlikely that we\u2019ll see the Bank of England raise interest rates this side of Christmas. Although wage pressures are emerging and the impact of the falling oil price will soon start to drop out of the numbers, a rate hike would have a deflationary effect by pushing up Sterling. At a time when the ECB is signalling it is ready to expand QE and the Fed is likely to delay its own rate lift-off into 2016, the Bank will be fearful of allowing Sterling to appreciate too much.\u201d There\u2019s no sign of deflation in the British housing market. New data shows that prices rose by 5.2% across the country in August: UK chancellor George Osborne insists that Britain is not entering a period of \u2018damaging deflation\u2019: Deflation is a protracted period in which prices fall in a downward spiral, and people stop spending because today\u2019s items are going to be cheaper tomorrow. The bigger picture is of a broadly flat inflation rate since the beginning of the year, says Richard Campbell, head of CPI at the Office for National Statistics. \u201cThe main downward pressures on CPI came from clothing, which rose more slowly this September than in recent years, and falling petrol and diesel prices.\u201d Clothing and footwear prices rose by 2.8% between August and September this year, compared to 4% between the same 2 months a year ago. That pushed the inflation rate down, to 0.1% in September. Fuel prices fell by 2.9% between August and September this year compared with a smaller fall of 0.6% between the same 2 months a year ago. The ONS says: The largest downward contribution came from petrol, with prices falling by 3.7 pence per litre between August and September this year compared with a fall of 0.8 pence per litre between the same 2 months a year ago. Diesel prices are now at their lowest level since December 2009, standing at 110.2 pence per litre. And a price cut by British Gas also helped cut the cost of living. Over to the ONS again: Gas prices fell by 2.1% between August and September this year, compared with no change between the same 2 months a year ago, with price reductions from a major supplier. Food and fuel have played a key role in dragging UK inflation down in the last year. Over the last year, food prices fell by 2.5% and prices of motor fuels fell by 14.9%, according to the ONS. This chart confirms that the UK\u2019s inflation rate has been bobbing around zero for most of this year. Here\u2019s the key points from today\u2019s inflation report: The Consumer Prices Index (CPI) fell by 0.1% in the year to September 2015, compared to no change (0.0%) in the year to August 2015. A smaller than usual rise in clothing prices and falling motor fuel prices were the main contributors to the fall in the rate. The rate of inflation has been at or around 0.0% for most of 2015. Here we go! UK inflation has turned negative again! The Consumer prices index fell by 0.1% in September, the Office for National Statistics reports. That\u2019s weaker than the zero reading that economists had expected. It\u2019s the first sub-zero reading since April. More to follow Crumbs! The pound has just taken a dive in the foreign exchange markets, dropping almost one cent against the US dollar. Traders may be calculating that September\u2019s UK inflation reading, due in a moment, is weaker than expected. Could the inflation number possibly have leaked?? More signs of weakness in Germany - Berlin is expected to trim its estimate for growth this year to 1.7%, down from 1.8%. Economy minister Sigmar Gabriel could announce the new forecast tomorrow, according to Reuters. This follows a hattrick of bad economic data last week, with factory orders, industrial production and exports all declining, as emerging market problems hit Germany. Just 30 minute to go until we get the Britain\u2019s inflation date for September. City economists broadly expect that the consumer prices index will remain flat for a second month, leaving inflation at zero. But a negative reading can\u2019t be ruled out. My colleague Katie Allen explains: Falling pump prices and a cut in energy bills by British Gas are expected to have kept inflation at zero last month, putting little pressure on the Bank of England to raise interest rates from their record low any time soon. Official figures on inflation due at 9.30am are forecast to show no change in the consumer prices index measure. Against the backdrop of tumbling global commodity prices, from food to oil, inflation in the UK has been at or close to zero since February, well below the Bank\u2019s target of 2%. While some have described low inflation as a sign of economic fragility, it relieves the pressure on household budgets after several years of wages falling in real terms following the financial crisis. The latest official figures on the jobs market on Wednesday are expected to put pay growth at 3.1%. Here\u2019s her preview: MPs could give Gertjan Vlieghe, Britain\u2019s newest interest rate setter, a rough ride when he appears before them in an hour\u2019s time. Vlieghe should expect some tough questions about his previous role as economist at a hedge fund (Brevan Howard Asset Management). Vlieghe was appointed to the Bank of England in late July. He had originally hoped to remain a member of Brevan Howard\u2019s long-term incentive plan, but was forced to exit it to avoid \u201cany mistaken impression\u201d of a conflict of interest. Alan Clarke, an economist at Scotiabank in London, reckons that those concerns may dominate today\u2019s hearing -- as Brevan Howard Asset Management (like any hedge fund) could potentially make or lose money due to decisions taken at the BoE. Clarke told Bloomberg: \u201cIt\u2019s probably right that happens because financial markets have not had a great reputation recently. Sadly, I think, that will overshadow what is an otherwise great appointment.\u201d Bloomberg economist Maxime Sbaihi predicts that today\u2019s ZEW survey, due at 10am BST, will show economic confidence deteriorated in Germany this month. European stock markets are all falling this morning, as the 20% slide in Chinese imports last month spooks traders. In London, the FTSE 100 has lost 36 points, or 0.6%, led by mining stocks such as Glencore (-4.5%). The French CAC shed 1%, while Germany\u2019s DAX is down 0.6%. Conner Campbell of SpreadEX explains: A whopping 20% fall in Chinese imports in September didn\u2019t get the day off to the best start, with that drop in demand sure to cause ripples of worry the world over. Shares in SABMiller have jumped by 9% at the start of trading in London, to around \u00a339.50. That\u2019s short of the \u00a344 per share proposal which its board have accepted; the City may not be 100% convinced that AB InBev will pull this deal off. AB InBev now has until 5pm on the 28th October to file a firm offer for SAB, having won the board round with its latest proposal. The key is whether Colombia\u2019s Santo Domingo family, which owns 14% of SABMiller, feels \u00a344 per share is enough. You know a deal is big when it moves the pound. Here\u2019s how sterling reacted to the news that AB INBev and SABMiller have agreed terms. One of the biggest takeover battles in the City in recent years is heading to a climax this morning. Anheuser-Busch InBev, the brewing giant behind Stella Artois and Budweiser, has announced it has \u201creached an agreement in principle on the key terms of a possible recommended offer\u201d for its rival, SABMiller (producer of Grolsch, Peroni, Pilsner Urquell...). Here\u2019s the statement issued to the City. At \u00a344 per share, the deal values SABMiller at around \u00a368bn -- making it the biggest takeover of a UK company ever. It\u2019s not signed and sealed yet, though - it still needs the support of SAB\u2019s shareholders. Yesterday, SAB rejected \u00a343.50 per share, but the board has now calculated that it can\u2019t turn down this new higher offer. More here: The impact of China\u2019s slowdown will be felt around the globe, warns economist Cees Bruggemans. The 20% tumble in Chinese imports last month means that growth is continuing to slow, says Yang Zhao, China economist at Nomura Holdings Inc. in Hong Kong. He said (via Bloomberg) \u201cImport growth remained sluggish, suggesting weakening domestic demand, particularly investment demand We maintain our view that GDP growth will decline to 6.7 percent in the third quarter.\u201d GDP growth was measured at 7.0% in the second quarter of 2015. The latest trade data from China has sent a shiver through the markets this morning. Chinese imports slumped by over 20% year-on-year in September (in dollar terms), a worse performance than economists had expected. That means imports have now fallen for 11 months running, as the country\u2019s economy has slowed. Exports dipped by 3.7% -- better than the 6% slide which was expected. But it\u2019s the slump in imports that is alarming analysts, as it hints at more problems building in China. Reuters has more details: Imports plunged 20.4% in September from a year earlier to $145.2bn, customs officials said, due to weak commodity prices and soft domestic demand. These factors will complicate Beijing\u2019s efforts to stave off deflation, one of the headwinds threatening the world\u2019s second biggest economy. The news helped to drive shares down in Asia, where Japan\u2019s Nikkei fell over 1% overnight. Commodity prices also weakened, as investors calculated that China would be importing less raw materials in the months ahead. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. After the glamour and drama of yesterday\u2019s Nobel economics prize, we\u2019re back into the gritty world of data this morning. At 9.30am, the latest UK inflation figures for September could show that the cost of living is falling again (at least according to the Consumer Price Index). It was 0% in August, mainly due to cheaper energy costs, and some economists think it could have fallen below zero last month. Then at 10am, Germany\u2019s ZEW economic sentiment index will highlight if the emerging market slowdown and the Volkswagen emissions scandal is hurting Europe\u2019s largest economy. Also coming up... At 10am, MPs on the Treasury Select Committee will grill Gertjan Vlieghe, the newest member of the Bank of England\u2019s monetary policy committee. And the banking reporting season will kick off later, with results from JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup and Wells Fargo.",

      "bodyText": "The \u00a368bn marriage of London-listed SABMiller and Anheuser-Busch InBev \u2013 the company behind America\u2019s favourite beer Bud Light \u2013 unites the world\u2019s two dominant brewing empires. But despite both owning famous brands such as Budweiser and Stella Artois (AB InBev), and Peroni and Coors (SABMiller), neither is a household name. Both empires have more humble roots, having built themselves up through a series of acquisitions and mergers to become the two largest brewers in the world. SABMiller The SAB in SABMiller stands for South African Breweries, which was founded in Johannesburg in 1895. Its main product was Castle beer, produced to quench the thirst of prospectors in the South African gold rush of the mid-1880s, according to the company\u2019s website. SAB bought its two nearest rivals, Ohlsson\u2019s and Chandlers, in 1956, giving the company 98% of South Africa\u2019s beer market. As international sanctions against apartheid increased, SAB expanded into other businesses in its home market such as hotels, grocery stores, furniture manufacture and clothes retailing. After apartheid was lifted, SAB sold off its non-brewing activities and under chief executive Graham Mackay embarked on a period of rapid international expansion. Mackay gained the capital to build his empire by moving SAB\u2019s main listing from Johannesburg to London in 1999. In 2002, Mackay bought the US brewer Miller from Philip Morris for $5.6bn including debt and changed the company\u2019s name to SABMiller. The deal left Philip Morris, the owner of Marlboro cigarettes and now renamed Altria, with a large holding in the combined SABMiller. Further expansion included buying Foster\u2019s in Australia, Peroni in Italy and Pilsner Urquell in the Czech Republic. SABMiller\u2019s CR Snow joint venture in China is that country\u2019s biggest brewer. Mackay, who died in 2013, also formed a joint venture with Molson Coors in the US, MillerCoors, and bought brewers in South America. This year SABMiller entered the UK craft beer market, buying London\u2019s Meantime brewery. AB InBev Through its ownership of Stella Artois, AB InBev\u2019s roots stretch back to 14th-century Belgium. Three aristocratic Belgian families still own a significant share of the business but the company\u2019s modern-day story started in 1989 when three Brazilian investment bankers bought the Brazilian brewer Brahma for $50m. AB InBev is now the biggest component in their business empire which also includes Heinz and Burger King, making the leader of the three dealmakers, Jorge Paolo Lemann, Brazil\u2019s richest man with a fortune put at $23bn. Brahma bought Brazilian rival Antarctica in 1999 to form AmBev, giving it 70% of the country\u2019s beer market. It expanded in Argentina before combining in 2004 with Interbrew, the Belgian maker of Stella Artois and owner of Beck\u2019s, to form the world\u2019s biggest brewer. In 2008, it bought Anheuser-Busch, the US maker of Budweiser, for $52bn to form AB InBev. The company, headed by Lemann\u2019s protege Carlos Brito, says its dream is to be \u201cthe best beer company, bringing people together for a better world\u201d. But critics argue its ruthless cost-cutting and efficiency have turned beer into a joyless product. The company is known for its high-pressure culture and merciless use of metrics to judge the performance of its young executives. In the US, revenue has stagnated, partly because beer drinkers have been turning away from Budweiser in favour of craft brews made by independent producers. AB InBev has responded by buying up craft brewers such as Chicago\u2019s Goose Island, Blue Point in New York state and, this year, Seattle\u2019s Elysian. US beer enthusiasts have claimed AB InBev is trying to confuse consumers or put independent brewers out of business with low prices. The company did little to endear itself to these drinkers with an advert during this year\u2019s Super Bowl ridiculing bearded beer hobbyists and claiming Budweiser is \u201cbrewed the hard way\u201d.",

The deal left Philip Morris, the owner of Marlboro cigarettes and now renamed Altria, with a large holding in the combined SABMiller.</p> <p>Further expansion included buying Foster\u2019s in Australia, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2003/may/15/13\">Peroni in Italy</a> and Pilsner Urquell in the Czech Republic. SABMiller\u2019s CR Snow joint venture in China is that country\u2019s biggest brewer.</p> <p>Mackay, who died in 2013, also formed a joint venture with Molson Coors in the US, MillerCoors, and bought brewers in South America. This year SABMiller entered the UK craft beer market, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/may/15/sab-miller-buys-meantime-to-enter-uk-craft-beer-market\">buying London\u2019s Meantime brewery</a>.<br></p> <h2>AB InBev</h2> <p>Through its ownership of Stella Artois, AB InBev\u2019s roots stretch back to 14th-century Belgium. Three aristocratic Belgian families still own a significant share of the business but the company\u2019s modern-day story started in 1989 when three Brazilian investment bankers bought the Brazilian brewer Brahma for $50m. </p> <p>AB InBev is now <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/oct/09/megabrew-takeover-beers-billions-blue-bloods-ab-inbev-sabmiller\">the biggest component in their business empire</a> which also includes Heinz and Burger King, making the leader of the three dealmakers, Jorge Paolo Lemann, Brazil\u2019s richest man with a fortune put at $23bn.</p> <p>Brahma bought Brazilian rival Antarctica in 1999 to form AmBev, giving it 70% of the country\u2019s beer market. It expanded in Argentina before combining in 2004 with Interbrew, the Belgian maker of Stella Artois and owner of Beck\u2019s, to form the world\u2019s biggest brewer. In 2008, it bought Anheuser-Busch, the US maker of Budweiser, for $52bn to form AB InBev.</p> <p>The company, headed by Lemann\u2019s protege Carlos Brito, says its dream is to be \u201cthe best beer company, bringing people together for a better world\u201d. But critics argue its ruthless cost-cutting and efficiency have turned beer into a joyless product. The company is known for its high-pressure culture and merciless use of metrics to judge the performance of its young executives.</p> <p>In the US, revenue has stagnated, partly because beer drinkers have been turning away from Budweiser in favour of craft brews made by independent producers. AB InBev has responded by buying up craft brewers such as Chicago\u2019s Goose Island, Blue Point in New York state and, this year, Seattle\u2019s Elysian.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2015-06-25/can-craft-beer-survive-ab-inbev-\">US beer enthusiasts have claimed AB InBev is trying to confuse consumers or put independent brewers out of business with low prices</a>. The company did little to endear itself to these drinkers <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=siHU_9ec94c\">with an advert during this year\u2019s Super Bowl</a> ridiculing bearded beer hobbyists and claiming Budweiser is \u201cbrewed the hard way\u201d.</p>",

Herbert Diess, the chief executive of the VW brand, said he would overhaul the division\u2019s strategy to concentrate on electric and hybrid vehicles and revamp all diesel cars and vans to feature cleaner exhaust emissions systems. The next version of the luxury Phaeton saloon car will be electric and VW will develop a standardised electric toolkit to fit all passenger cars and light commercial vehicles. Diess said: \u201cThe Volkswagen brand is repositioning itself for the future. We are becoming more efficient, we are giving our product range and our core technologies a new focus, and we are creating room for forward-looking technologies by speeding up the efficiency program. \u201cWe are very aware that we can only implement these innovations for the future of the Volkswagen brand effectively if we succeed with our efficiency program and in giving our product range a new focus.\u201d Diess announced the plans, apparently designed to reinforce VW\u2019s environmental credentials, as data showed the emissions affair had damaged business confidence in Germany. The scandal, which has raged since Volkswagen admitted cheating US emissions tests last month, could cost the company as much as \u20ac35bn in fines, lawsuits and other costs, analysts have estimated. Morale among German investors and analysts, also affected by slowing emerging market economies, has fallen sharply, sending the ZEW thinktank\u2019s economic sentiment indicator down from 12.1 to 1.9. The VW scandal has stunned the German business establishment, which looked on the Lower Saxony carmaker as a symbol of the country\u2019s engineering expertise.",

      "bodyText": "This is going to be a record-breaking year for UK inflation. Not since the interwar period has upward pressure on the cost of living been as persistently weak as it has since the start of 2015. Consider the numbers. In January, inflation as measured by the consumer prices index, stood at 0.3%. In the next eight months, it was zero four times, up by 0.1% twice and down by 0.1% twice. The latest data shows that it costs 0.1% less to buy the basket of goods and services chosen by the Office for National Statistics to measure inflation than it did in September 2014. This does not mean Britain is mired in deflation, a definition that would only apply in the event that prices fell markedly for a prolonged period of time. Two 0.1% drops in inflation (one in April, one in September) do not meet this definition. That said, inflation has been lower for longer than the Bank of England expected in its inflation report in November 2014, when it thought the cost of living would dip below 1% \u201cin the near term\u201d before rising again. That has implications for monetary policy. An increase in interest rates has been delayed while the Bank assesses the impact of two distinct forces affecting the economy: one domestic, one coming from overseas. On the domestic front, the Bank is keeping an eye on what is happening to wages. Average earnings growth has picked up a bit since the start of the year, although it remains a long way below the levels that were typical in the pre-crisis years. Wednesday\u2019s labour market figures will give a clue as to what happened to pay packets in the three months to August, a period when the economy\u2019s growth rate slowed. Events in the rest of the world have been pushing inflation in the opposite direction. Oil and metal prices have been falling as a result of softer global demand while a stronger pound has made imports cheaper. The Bank is therefore confronted with a situation in which the inflation rate for goods is -2.4% while the inflation rate for services is +2.5%. Goods prices are being depressed by what\u2019s happening overseas; services are more affected by conditions in the labour market, although even here the pick up in inflation has been modest \u2013 service sector inflation started the year at 2.4% and dipped as low as 2% in April. The assumption is that goods inflation will start to rise in coming months, largely due to the fact that there were extremely sharp falls in oil prices in the final three months of 2014. Unless these are repeated this year, inflation will rise as a matter of basic arithmetic. This looks a reasonable bet provided there is no further deterioration in the global economy. Recent data from China, Japan, the US and Germany has been disappointing. Financial markets say this is merely a soft patch. That, though, is what they said last time.",

In the next eight months, it was zero four times, up by 0.1% twice and down by 0.1% twice. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/oct/13/uk-inflations-dips-below-zero\">The latest data shows that it costs 0.1% less to buy the basket of goods and services </a>chosen by the Office for National Statistics to measure inflation than it did in September 2014.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/oct/13/uk-inflations-dips-below-zero\">UK inflation dips below zero again</a> </p> </aside>  <p>This does not mean Britain is mired in deflation, a definition that would only apply in the event that prices fell markedly for a prolonged period of time. Two 0.1% drops in inflation (one in April, one in September) do not meet this definition.</p> <p>That said, inflation has been lower for longer than <a href=\"http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/Documents/inflationreport/2014/ir14nov.pdf\">the Bank of England expected in its inflation report in November 2014</a>, when it thought the cost of living would dip below 1% \u201cin the near term\u201d before rising again. That has implications for monetary policy. An increase in interest rates has been delayed while the Bank assesses the impact of two distinct forces affecting the economy: one domestic, one coming from overseas.</p> <p>On the domestic front, the Bank is keeping an eye on what is happening to wages. Average earnings growth has picked up a bit since the start of the year, although it remains a long way below the levels that were typical in the pre-crisis years. Wednesday\u2019s labour market figures will give a clue as to what happened to pay packets in the three months to August, a period when the economy\u2019s growth rate slowed.</p> <p>Events in the rest of the world have been pushing inflation in the opposite direction. Oil and metal prices have been falling as a result of softer global demand while a stronger pound has made imports cheaper.</p> <p>The Bank is therefore confronted with a situation in which the inflation rate for goods is -2.4% while the inflation rate for services is +2.5%. Goods prices are being depressed by what\u2019s happening overseas; services are more affected by conditions in the labour market, although even here the pick up in inflation has been modest \u2013 service sector inflation started the year at 2.4% and dipped as low as 2% in April.</p> <p>The assumption is that goods inflation will start to rise in coming months, largely due to the fact that there were extremely sharp falls in oil prices in the final three months of 2014. Unless these are repeated this year, inflation will rise as a matter of basic arithmetic.</p> <p>This looks a reasonable bet provided there is no further deterioration in the global economy.<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/oct/13/china-imports-slump-20-amid-falling-commodity-prices-and-weak-demand\"> Recent data from China</a>, Japan, the US and Germany has been disappointing. Financial markets say this is merely a soft patch. That, though, is what they said last time.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The prospect of an American investment banker being appointed to run Barclays has sparked a warning that policymakers should not cave into industry pressure to water down new rules introduced since the 2008 crisis. Amid expectations that the bank is lining up Jes Staley, formerly at JPMorgan Chase, to take its helm, a leading MP said it was crucial that rules requiring a ringfence between high street and investment banking arms were implemented. \u201cAny expansion of the investment bank would increase the importance of ensuring the ringfence is rigorously applied,\u201d said Andrew Tyrie, the Conservative MP who chairs the Treasury select committee. The separation was recommended by the Independent Commission on Banking, chaired by Sir John Vickers, and must be implemented by 2019. Uncertainty about the implications of a veteran investment banker taking charge of Barclays sparked a fall in its shares, which closed 2% lower on Tuesday. Staley \u2013 who currently runs the BlueMountain hedge fund \u2013 is the frontrunner to replace Antony Jenkins, who was ousted in July after three years battling to restore the bank\u2019s reputation following the Libor rigging scandal. Barclays is still in negotiations over Staley\u2019s recruitment, only saying that \u201cthe process of appointing a new group chief executive officer has not yet concluded and Barclays will provide a further update once that is complete\u201d. But expectations of his appointment sparked speculation his focus would be on the investment banking arm built up under Bob Diamond, the US banker who was ousted during the Libor scandal, and signal a return to the ostentatious style of banking that has been frowned upon since the 2008 crisis. Russ Mould, investment director at stockbroker AJ Bell, said: \u201cInvestment banks are generally a good business for employees and a bad one for shareholders, rather like football clubs. Investors tend to attribute a low valuation to them, as they are volatile, cyclical, soak up a lot of regulatory capital and come with high wage bills.\u201d Jenkins had put 14,000 jobs on the line, including 7,000 in the investment bank, which was being positioned away from traditional area of expertise in fixed income, currencies and commodities and more towards advising big corporate customers. It is the second time Staley has been been tipped for the Barclays role. He was linked to the job when Diamond left, before Jenkins was promoted from running the retail bank. Jenkins was regarded as safer choice and avoided controversy over a potential pay deal for Staley that could have run to tens of millions of pounds. Assuming Staley is appointed, he would also be joining the ranks of ex-JP Morgan officials at the top of British banking. Barclays\u2019 finance director, Tushar Morzaria, was hired in 2013 from the US bank and awarded \u00a33.2m shares to buy him out of his bonuses. Bill Winters \u2013 who Staley replaced as the boss of JP Morgan\u2019s investment bank \u2013 is now running Standard Chartered and received more than \u00a36m of shares to buy him out of the hedge fund he joined after leaving JP Morgan. The timing of any appointment is unclear as the Bank of England\u2019s regulation arm would need to approve his role and has not yet done so. While not well known in the UK, Staley spent more than 30 years at JPMorgan Chase and was regarded as the likely successor to Jamie Dimon. But in 2013 \u2013 when JP Morgan was trying to recover from the London Whale trading incident \u2013 he left to join Blue Mountain. He is known to be a keen sailor, and has a custom-made 90ft yacht Bequia, named after the Caribbean island where he honeymooned with his wife, Debbie. Sandy Chen, analyst at the broker Cenkos, said it could be an opportunity to restructure Barclays. \u201cWe think an option worth considering \u2013 which we\u2019ve advocated in the past \u2013 would be formally carving out the investment bank and moving it to the US. Of course, it would have to be cleaned up and maybe recapitalised along the way \u2013 but this is what those investment bankers are good at. This, we think, would probably please the regulators on both sides of the pond \u2013 and it would then make those sum-of-the-parts valuations for Barclays more worthwhile.\u201d",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "If Jes Staley is named the new boss of Barclays \u2013 as widely anticipated \u2013 it will be a case of second time lucky. When Bob Diamond was forced out in the wake of the 2012 Libor-rigging crisis, Staley was tipped for the role, only for the bank to settle for the safer choice of Antony Jenkins, already running Barclays\u2019 high street operations. With Jenkins lasting barely three years before being pushed out to accelerate the pace of change, Staley now appears to be ready to take on the job at a time when policymakers fear bankers are pushing back against the regulatory changes imposed following the bailout of the UK\u2019s banks, announced seven years ago this week. Born in Boston, Massachusetts on 27 December 1956, and educated at small liberal arts specialist Bowdoin College, James E Staley earned his reputation as an investment banker during a 30-year career at JP Morgan, including a stint in Brazil. Once tipped for the top and a potential successor to the irrepressible Jamie Dimon, Staley left in 2013 when JP Morgan was trying to recover from the London Whale trading incident, which blew a hole in the bank\u2019s balance sheet and exposed management failings at the bank. As he quit to join BlueMountain, Staley told the Wall Street Journal (\u00a3): \u201cI think the Barclays conversations ultimately helped me define what I was really after.\u201d Three years on, the latest conversations appear to have been enough to entice him across the Atlantic \u2013 and away from his custom-made 90ft yacht Bequia, named after the Caribbean island where he honeymooned with his wife Debbie. Maine Home and Design is gushing in its description of the vessel, which is reportedly moored off New England: \u201cMost large wooden yachts built in recent years have interiors dominated by vast amounts of varnished wood cabinetry. Bequia is something entirely different. Most of her interior is painted in various shades of white ... it is a warm, homelike, upbeat space \u2013 a far cry from the sometimes oppressive atmosphere created by the dark, all-varnished interiors typical of many recent large yachts.\u201d Staley\u2019s own account is more modest. \u201cIt\u2019s not a big yacht ... but it is a big boat,\u201d he told Fortune. Barclays shareholders \u2013 as well as policymakers and politicians \u2013 will be wondering whether the appointment of the globe-trotting banker will mark a return to the ostentatious style of bankers frowned upon after the 2008 banking crisis and even more so after the Libor-rigging scandals. An advocate of diversity in the workplace, Staley\u2019s brother Peter is a gay activist, and women have credited him with their promotions. He will have to step down as a non-executive director of Swiss bank UBS \u2013 a position he has only just taken on \u2013 but would be working with another former JP Morgan employee, Tushar Morzaria, hired in 2013 to work alongside Jenkins as finance director.

    "webTitle": "UK inflation dips below zero again", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Inflation in Britain has dipped below zero for the second time this year, easing pressure on the Bank of England to raise interest rates from their record low. Official figures showed inflation was down from zero in August to -0.1% in September, pulled lower by cheaper fuel prices. Economists had expected the rate as measured by the consumer prices index (CPI) to hold at zero, according to the consensus in a Reuters poll. But some had predicted inflation could fall into negative territory. Negative again Inflation has been at, or close to, zero since February and dipped into negative territory in April this year when prices fell for the first time in more than 50 years. Commenting on the latest figures, Richard Campbell of the Office for National Statistics said: \u201cThough CPI has turned very slightly negative this month, the bigger picture is of a broadly flat inflation rate since the beginning of the year. The main downward pressures on CPI came from clothing, which rose more slowly this September than in recent years, and falling petrol and diesel prices.\u201d There was also some downward effect from household energy bills after a price cut from British Gas. Even stripping out more volatile prices, such as fuel and food, the so-called core measure of inflation undershot expectations in September. The ONS said the rate held at 1.0%, defying a forecast for a 1.1% reading. While some have described negative inflation as a sign of economic fragility, the chancellor, George Osborne, sought to play down fears that the UK had slipped into deflation. The Bank of England is set an inflation target of 2% by the government, but the rate has been below that since the start of 2014. The low rate reflects sharp falls in global commodity prices, from food to fuel. The ONS said food prices fell by 2.5% and motor fuel prices fell by 14.9% in the year to September. Against that backdrop, interest rates have been held at a record low of 0.5% for more than six years. Economists see little chance of them being raised until well into 2016. At the last meeting of the Bank\u2019s monetary policy committee (MPC) last week, only one member, Ian McCafferty, voted for a hike. Speaking to MPs on Tuesday, he said the effects that pulled the latest inflation number lower appeared to be \u201ctransitory\u201d. He told the Treasury select committee that the negative rate would not in isolation \u201cchange my view of the last few months\u201d. But fellow MPC member Jan Vlieghe appeared to see bigger risks that inflation will not recover as quickly to meet the Bank\u2019s 2% target. He also flagged risks to the UK from a global slowdown. Commenting on inflation indicators, he told MPs: \u201cI am not confident enough right now that they will rise in order to vote for an immediate rate hike. I think we have time. We can wait and see how this plays out and I would want to see a more convincing broad-based upward trajectory before I say, \u2018OK, now I am confident enough that we will get to 2% eventually and therefore vote for a rate rise.\u2019\u201d The Bank\u2019s governor, Mark Carney, has previously told Britons to enjoy low inflation while it lasts and reassured them the UK is not headed for all-out deflation, where widespread price falls become entrenched. The government has repeatedly emphasised the boost to household budgets as wages finally rise faster than prices. However, economists warn some of the factors keeping inflation low could fade in coming months. \u201cEven though wages are likely to climb further from here, CPI inflation will probably rise slightly faster, so this is probably as good as it gets for the consumer,\u201d said Alan Clarke, economist at Scotiabank. Inflation turning negative once again is potentially bad news for savers because it means the maximum amount people are able to put into an Isa could be frozen in 2016. As increases to the Isa allowance are based on the CPI inflation figure for the year to the previous September, the new data suggests the current Isa limit of \u00a315,240 will remain unchanged next year. A cut in the allowance is possible in theory, though seems highly unlikely. It is possible that Osborne might decide to announce a hike in the autumn statement on 25 November. September\u2019s CPI figure also affects the basic state pension. The government introduced the so-called \u201ctriple lock\u201d, which means the basic state pension rises by either the September CPI figure, growth in average weekly earnings or 2.5%, whichever is highest. Earnings growth for May to July 2015 is running at a provisional 2.9% compared with a the same period last year, suggesting that people already receiving a full basic state pension would see their weekly income rise from \u00a3115.95 to about \u00a3119.31 in 2016, said Tom McPhail, head of retirement policy at investment firm Hargreaves Lansdown. The finalised figure, which will determine how much pensioners receive next year, will be confirmed by the ONS on Wednesday \u2013 though there will be no certainty on this issue until after the chancellor has sat down on 25 November, as he could decide to increase this figure or announce other changes.",

The low rate reflects sharp falls in global commodity prices, from food to fuel. The ONS said food prices fell by 2.5% and motor fuel prices fell by 14.9% in the year to September.<br></p> <p>Against that backdrop, interest rates have been held at a record low of 0.5% for more than six years. Economists see little chance of them being raised until well into 2016.</p> <p>At the last meeting of the Bank\u2019s monetary policy committee (MPC) last week, only one member, Ian McCafferty, voted for a hike.</p> <p>Speaking to MPs on Tuesday, he said the effects that pulled the latest inflation number lower appeared to be \u201ctransitory\u201d. He told the Treasury select committee that the negative rate would not in isolation \u201cchange my view of the last few months\u201d.</p> <p>But fellow MPC member Jan Vlieghe appeared to see bigger risks that inflation will not recover as quickly to meet the Bank\u2019s 2% target. He also flagged risks to the UK from a global slowdown.</p> <p>Commenting on inflation indicators, he told MPs: \u201cI am not confident enough right now that they will rise in order to vote for an immediate rate hike. I think we have time. We can wait and see how this plays out and I would want to see a more convincing broad-based upward trajectory before I say, \u2018OK, now I am confident enough that we will get to 2% eventually and therefore vote for a rate rise.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>The Bank\u2019s governor, Mark Carney, has previously told Britons to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2015/may/19/uk-inflation-greek-bailout-talks-yanis-varoufakis-live-updates#block-555b1621e4b013760d175b39\">enjoy low inflation while it lasts</a> and reassured them the UK is not headed for <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/may/19/is-this-deflation-or-negative-inflation-qa?CMP=share_btn_tw\">all-out deflation</a>, where widespread price falls become entrenched. The government has repeatedly emphasised the boost to household budgets as wages finally rise faster than prices.</p> <p>However, economists warn some of the factors keeping inflation low could fade in coming months.</p> <p>\u201cEven though wages are likely to climb further from here, CPI inflation will probably rise slightly faster, so this is probably as good as it gets for the consumer,\u201d said Alan Clarke, economist at Scotiabank. </p> <p>Inflation turning negative once again is potentially bad news for savers because it means the maximum amount people are able to put into an Isa could be frozen in 2016.</p> <p>As increases to the Isa allowance are based on the CPI inflation figure for the year to the previous September, the new data suggests the current Isa limit of \u00a315,240 will remain unchanged next year. A cut in the allowance is possible in theory, though seems highly unlikely. It is possible that Osborne might decide to announce a hike in the autumn statement on 25 November.<br><br>September\u2019s CPI figure also affects the basic state pension. The government introduced the so-called \u201ctriple lock\u201d, which means the basic state pension rises by either the September CPI figure, growth in average weekly earnings or 2.5%, whichever is highest. </p> <p>Earnings growth for May to July 2015 is running at a provisional 2.9% compared with a the same period last year, suggesting that people already receiving a full basic state pension would see their weekly income rise from \u00a3115.95 to about \u00a3119.31 in 2016, said Tom McPhail, head of retirement policy at investment firm Hargreaves Lansdown.</p> <p>The finalised figure, which will determine how much pensioners receive next year, will be confirmed by the ONS on Wednesday \u2013 though there will be no certainty on this issue until after the chancellor has sat down on 25 November, as he could decide to increase this figure or announce other changes.</p>",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "SABMiller has agreed to sell itself to Anheuser-Busch InBev for $104bn (\u00a368bn) in a deal that will be the biggest takeover of a British company and create the world\u2019s first global brewer. The takeover, one of the top five deals in corporate history, will create a brewing empire making about a third of the world\u2019s beer. AB InBev is already the world\u2019s biggest brewer, and SABMiller is its closest rival. The boards of the two companies said they had reached agreement in principle on the key terms of a \u201cpossible recommended offer\u201d after SABMiller rejected repeated approaches by AB InBev over the past month. SAB\u2019s top managers will share a potential $2.1bn payout of shares and options if the deal is completed, according to analysts at Bernstein. Alan Clark, SABMiller\u2019s chief executive, is likely to receive more than \u00a380m. The deal would create a company generating more than $70bn of annual revenue from brewing 80bn litres of beer a year. The giant corporation will have big operations in Europe, north America, Latin America and the Asia Pacific region, and will give AB InBev, the brewer of the US\u2019s favourite beer, Bud Light, access to the fast-growing African beer market. London-listed SABMiller said AB InBev \u2013 which brews Budweiser and Stella Artois \u2013 proposed to pay \u00a344 a share in cash. It also proposed a partial share payment for the 41% of the company owned by SABMiller\u2019s two biggest shareholders, Altria, the maker of Philip Morris cigarettes, and BevCo, owned by Colombia\u2019s billionaire Santo Domingo brewing family. The \u00a344 cash offer values SABMiller, the maker of Peroni and Grolsch, at about 50% more than its value on 14 September, before news of AB InBev\u2019s interest leaked. If all the shares were sold for that price it would value SABMiller at \u00a371bn, but the \u00a339.03 part-share alternative, devised for tax reasons, brings the valuation down to about \u00a368bn. SABMiller shares rose 8.6% on the news to \u00a339.31. AB InBev had until 5pm on 14 October to lodge a formal bid after having five previous proposals turned down, including a \u00a343.50-a-share approach on Monday. At SABMiller\u2019s request, the takeover panel has extended its deadline for AB InBev to make a firm offer until 28 October. SABMiller has negotiated a $3bn break-fee payable by AB InBev if the deal falls through because of competition hurdles or opposition by the latter\u2019s shareholders. The agreement in principle appears to settle a month of manoeuvres over a long-rumoured deal between the two companies. SABMiller rejected three approaches of \u00a338, \u00a340 and \u00a342 a share in private before AB InBev tried to force the board\u2019s hand by going public with a \u00a342.15 proposal last week. AB InBev\u2019s chief executive, Carlos Brito, complained that SABMiller had refused to enter substantive talks and urged shareholders to put pressure on the board. SABMiller, led by its chairman, Jan du Plessis, said AB InBev\u2019s approaches were opportunistic and \u201cvery substantially\u201d undervalued the company, before accepting the latest proposal. If completed, the takeover will secure AB InBev a target it has long coveted. Backed by Brazil\u2019s richest man, the financier Jorge Paulo Lemann, the Belgian-Brazilian brewer has expanded aggressively through big deals including combining with Interbrew, the maker of Stella Artois, in 2004 and buying the US Budweiser brewer, Anheuser-Busch, four years later. Brito said AB InBev decided to make a move after carrying out research on Africa, where SABMiller, founded in Johannesburg in 1895, is the dominant brewer. The charity ActionAid has criticised SABMiller for paying low taxes on its profits in Africa, including in Ghana. AB InBev also learnt that Altria and BevCo would be receptive to an offer, Brito said, though his overtures split the two big shareholders at first. Altria, with a 27% stake, told SABMiller to enter talks last week but the Santo Domingos, with almost 14% of the shares, sided with the board in rejecting AB InBev\u2019s earlier approaches. James Edwardes Jones, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets, said: \u201cSABMiller\u2019s board, it is now apparent, has negotiated very effectively rather than frustrating its shareholders by clinging on to its independence.\u201d Brito said last week that the deal would be good for consumers because AB InBev would be able to sell its beers in Africa and other markets where SABMiller has big operations. But AB InBev has a reputation for ruthless cost-cutting and its US sales have been under pressure partly because beer drinkers have shunned big brands in favour of craft beer. Adrian Tierney-Jones, the secretary of the British Guild of Beer Writers, said SABMiller had preserved the character of beers it had bought such as Pilsner Urquell in the Czech Republic. But he said creating a megabrewer raised concerns, especially as both companies have been buying craft beer producers. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s good for beer. The more things get bigger, the more you lose touch with what\u2019s happening on the ground. The bottom line for these guys is profit,\u201d he said.",

The giant corporation will have big operations in Europe, north America, Latin America and the Asia Pacific region, and will give AB InBev, the brewer of the US\u2019s favourite beer, Bud Light, access to the fast-growing African beer market.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/oct/09/megabrew-takeover-beers-billions-blue-bloods-ab-inbev-sabmiller\">The Megabrew takeover \u2013 a tale of beers, billions and blue bloods</a> </p> </aside>  <p>London-listed SABMiller said AB InBev \u2013 which brews Budweiser and Stella Artois \u2013 proposed to pay \u00a344 a share in cash. It also proposed a partial share payment for the 41% of the company owned by SABMiller\u2019s two biggest shareholders, Altria, the maker of Philip Morris cigarettes, and BevCo, owned by Colombia\u2019s billionaire Santo Domingo brewing family.<br></p> <p>The \u00a344 cash offer values SABMiller, the maker of Peroni and Grolsch, at about 50% more than its value on 14 September, before news of AB InBev\u2019s interest leaked. If all the shares were sold for that price it would value SABMiller at \u00a371bn, but the \u00a339.03 part-share alternative, devised for tax reasons, brings the valuation down to about \u00a368bn.</p> <p>SABMiller shares rose 8.6% on the news to \u00a339.31. AB InBev had until 5pm on 14 October to lodge a formal bid after having five previous proposals turned down, including a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/oct/12/megabrew-takeover-major-sabmiller-investor-rejects-takeover-approach\">\u00a343.50-a-share approach on Monday</a>. At SABMiller\u2019s request, the takeover panel has extended its deadline for AB InBev to make a firm offer until 28 October.</p> <p>SABMiller has negotiated a $3bn break-fee payable by AB InBev if the deal falls through because of competition hurdles or opposition by the latter\u2019s shareholders.</p> <p>The agreement in principle appears to settle a month of manoeuvres over a long-rumoured deal between the two companies. SABMiller rejected three approaches of \u00a338, \u00a340 and \u00a342 a share in private before AB InBev tried to force the board\u2019s hand by going public with a \u00a342.15 proposal last week.</p> <p>AB InBev\u2019s chief executive, Carlos Brito, complained that SABMiller had <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/oct/08/beer-merger-ab-inbev-says-sabmiller-board-has-refused-to-engage-with-us\">refused to enter substantive talks</a> and urged shareholders to put pressure on the board. SABMiller, led by its chairman, Jan du Plessis, said AB InBev\u2019s approaches were opportunistic and \u201cvery substantially\u201d undervalued the company, before accepting the latest proposal.</p> <p>If completed, the takeover will secure AB InBev a target it has long coveted. Backed by Brazil\u2019s richest man, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/oct/09/megabrew-takeover-beers-billions-blue-bloods-ab-inbev-sabmiller\">the financier Jorge Paulo Lemann</a>, the Belgian-Brazilian brewer has expanded aggressively through big deals including combining with Interbrew, the maker of Stella Artois, in 2004 and buying the US Budweiser brewer, Anheuser-Busch, four years later.</p> <p>Brito said AB InBev decided to make a move after carrying out research on Africa, where SABMiller, founded in Johannesburg in 1895, is the dominant brewer. The charity ActionAid has criticised SABMiller for paying low taxes on its profits in Africa, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/oct/08/tax-reforms-corporate-avoidance-poor-countries-denied-billions-small-beer\">including in Ghana</a>.</p> <p>AB InBev also learnt that Altria and BevCo would be receptive to an offer, Brito said, though his overtures split the two big shareholders at first. Altria, with a 27% stake, told SABMiller to enter talks last week but the Santo Domingos, with almost 14% of the shares, sided with the board in rejecting AB InBev\u2019s earlier approaches.</p> <p>James Edwardes Jones, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets, said: \u201cSABMiller\u2019s board, it is now apparent, has negotiated very effectively rather than frustrating its shareholders by clinging on to its independence.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"http://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2015/10/miller-inbevtakeover/giv-31114uF1UO5653J0o/\" data-alt=\"SABMiller takeover in numbers\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2015/10/miller-inbevtakeover/giv-31114uF1UO5653J0o/\">SABMiller takeover in numbers</a> </figure>  <p>Brito said last week that the deal <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/oct/07/ab-inbev-raises-takeover-offer-sabmiller-brewer\">would be good for consumers </a>because AB InBev would be able to sell its beers in Africa and other markets where SABMiller has big operations. But AB InBev has a reputation for ruthless cost-cutting and its US sales have been under pressure partly because beer drinkers have shunned big brands in favour of craft beer.</p> <p>Adrian Tierney-Jones, the secretary of the British Guild of Beer Writers, said SABMiller had preserved the character of beers it had bought such as Pilsner Urquell in the Czech Republic. But he said creating a megabrewer raised concerns, especially as both companies have been buying craft beer producers.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s good for beer. The more things get bigger, the more you lose touch with what\u2019s happening on the ground. The bottom line for these guys is profit,\u201d he said. </p>",

      "bodyText": "Falling pump prices and a cut in energy bills by British Gas are expected to have kept inflation at zero last month, putting little pressure on the Bank of England to raise interest rates from their record low any time soon. Official figures on inflation due at 9.30am are forecast to show no change in the consumer prices index measure. Against the backdrop of tumbling global commodity prices, from food to oil, inflation in the UK has been at or close to zero since February, well below the Bank\u2019s target of 2%. While some have described low inflation as a sign of economic fragility, it relieves the pressure on household budgets after several years of wages falling in real terms following the financial crisis. The latest official figures on the jobs market on Wednesday are expected to put pay growth at 3.1%. Hugging zero In a poll of economists by Reuters, the consensus was for inflation to remain at zero in September, but some forecast it could edge up and some see the rate dipping to -0.1%, marking a return to the negative territory hit in April this year when prices fell for the first time in more than 50 years. While the influence of petrol and diesel prices is easy to anticipate, as is the effect of a 5% British Gas price cut, economists say that airfares are a bit of a wild card. They typically fall after the summer but the drop might not be as steep as last year, when there was a sharp dip in oil prices, says Victoria Clarke, an economist at Investec. \u201cWe look for CPI inflation to remain steady at zero once again,\u201d she adds. Alan Clarke, a Scotiabank economist, is forecasting a -0.1% reading, based on downward pressure from fuel, gas bills, alcohol and food. \u201cWe expect CPI inflation to slip back into negative territory in September (and stay there in October) before powerful base effects start to propel inflation back up towards 1% by the new year,\u201d he says. The nine policymakers at the Bank of England who vote on interest rates will also be watching the core inflation rate, which strips out more volatile prices like food and energy. That is forecast to edge up to 1.1% in September from 1% in August. At the last meeting of the monetary policy committee (MPC), only one of the nine ratesetters, Ian McCafferty, voted to raise rates from 0.5%, where they have been for more than six years. But others may soon feel that signs of rising wage growth and higher core inflation are reason to follow suit, say economists. \u201cWhile headline CPI is likely to remain near zero, we would not be surprised to see core inflation rebound somewhat. As such, the possibility of more MPC members joining Ian McCafferty in voting for a rate rise in November could grow,\u201d said James Knightley, a senior economist at ING Financial Markets. Policymakers will have to balance any risks to inflation they see from wages, however, against recent signs that UK GDP growth has lost momentum, hurt by a downturn in China and a slowdown in the wider global economy.",

      "bodyText": "The Turnbull government appears set to reach a deal to secure passage of the China-Australia free trade agreement (Chafta) after it vowed to consider the opposition\u2019s demands \u201cin good faith\u201d in a bid to resolve the long-running political dispute. On Tuesday the federal Labor party signed off on its proposed amendments to the Migration Act, which would form the basis of negotiations with the government aimed at passing legislation necessary to implement Chafta. The trade minister, Andrew Robb, signalled that the government was prepared to accept changes, so long as the measures did not discriminate against China or breach the text of the agreement. \u201cWe\u2019ll have genuine discussions with the Labor party and hopefully it will identify a pathway to get these things through the parliament,\u201d Robb said. Labor\u2019s proposals include a mandatory requirement for employers to try to find local workers before seeking overseas labour under the 457 visa scheme. They would also increase the minimum base pay for foreign workers from $53,900 to $57,000 and would ensure tradespeople obtained the required occupational licence as a visa condition. Labor says the labour-market-testing rule would apply to employers using work agreements, which include the Chafta-negotiated arrangements for major development projects in Australia, but because they have broader effect they are \u201cnon-discriminatory\u201d. The amendments \u2013 which were discussed at a caucus meeting on Tuesday \u2013 represent an attempt by Labor\u2019s leader, Bill Shorten, and trade spokeswoman, Penny Wong, to overcome the intense political dispute over Chafta. Labor is hopeful of reaching a deal with Malcolm Turnbull, who has signalled the government is open to talks with Labor about any specific proposals. The former prime minister, Tony Abbott, had ruled out such talks on the basis that \u201cthere is nothing to negotiate\u201d. Shorten said the opposition had crafted its amendments in a way that did not require a reopening of negotiations with Beijing on the treaty text, but would \u201cmake sure that all Australians can be winners out of a China free trade agreement\u201d. \u201cToday we urge Malcolm Turnbull and the government to come to the table to deal with a range of concerns that have been put forward and then we can all successfully support the China free trade agreement,\u201d he said. It is understood seven Labor MPs or senators called for the party to take a stronger line when they addressed the caucus meeting on Tuesday. Five others spoke in favour of the party\u2019s proposed position, which was ultimately adopted. The long caucus debate was said to be \u201crobust and hard-fought\u201d. Some members of the Labor caucus were concerned about Chafta including an investor-state dispute settlement mechanism that allowed companies to sue the government. They were also worried about the consequences of the chapter dealing with the movement of natural persons. But Wong said there were limits to what could be done about the chapter because it was in the text of the agreement. Labor had proposed lifting the base pay as a way of dealing with the potential issue of exploitation of foreign workers, she told reporters after the meeting. Wong said while the Labor party may have concerns about aspects of Chafta, \u201cwe recognise as a responsible opposition that we have to work within the framework of the existing agreement\u201d. Wong emphasised that the proposed changes were merely an \u201cexposure draft\u201d \u2013 a position that appeared to leave the door open to shifting ground on the details in forthcoming negotiations with the government. \u201cThey would enable, if the negotiation is successful, bipartisan support for the China free trade agreement, which we believe is in the national interest,\u201d she said. Wong would not say whether Labor would seek to block the Chafta legislation if the government blocked any of the proposed amendments. \u201cWe\u2019ll go through that process of negotiation and consultation and if we\u2019re not in a position to finalise those prior to the House [of Representatives] discussion then obviously we\u2019ll move them in the Senate,\u201d she said. Unions were pushing for Labor to take a hard line against the foreign worker provisions in the deal, and were accused by the government of running a xenophobic campaign. The union movement insisted the concerns were legitimate. The government wants to pass the Chafta implementation legislation before the end of the year so Australian companies can gain the benefit of two rounds of tariff cuts in quick succession. Robb said the government had yet to study Labor\u2019s proposals in detail but would have \u201cgenuine discussions\u201d with the opposition soon. The trade minister played down the significance of the proposed changes, saying it was already government policy to require labour market testing for workers on major projects worth $150m and above. Labor wanted this to be protected in legislation rather than as a matter of policy. \u201cAt first glance, the things that they are asking for either provide clarity or they provide greater comfort to existing measures,\u201d Robb said. He argued that if the government accepted amendments it would not amount to a concession that there were problems in the original agreement. This was because Labor had conceded that the substance of Chafta could not be changed, Robb said. The Greens senator Peter Whish-Wilson said the proposed amendments were \u201csimply playing around the edges\u201d and would not stop Chafta from driving down wages and working conditions. \u201cBy not attempting to fix chapter 10 of Chafta, Labor is accepting the need to remove labour market testing for contractual service providers,\u201d Whish-Wilson said. \u201cThis covers a wide range of occupations, from IT technicians to cleaners. Labor may have sought to increase the wage threshold for Chinese contractual service providers, but in many circumstances this will still be well below Australian award rates.\u201d The Australian Council of Trade Unions said the amendments were \u201ca step in the right direction\u201d but there were \u201cstill some details that need improvement\u201d. \u201cWe look forward to the opportunity to work with the ALP, the government and crossbenches to that end,\u201d said the president of the peak union body, Ged Kearney. \u201cWe will continue to discuss our concerns until we are convinced that workers\u2019 jobs are protected.\u201d The Electrical Trades Union, which was one of the main unions campaigning against Chafta, also stopped short of expressing immediate support for Labor\u2019s position. A spokesman said the ETU was \u201ccurrently reviewing\u201d the proposed amendments and was hopeful of achieving \u201cmeaningful and effective safeguards for Australian jobs and conditions, as well as protections for worker safety and migrant workers\u201d. Several business groups reacted cautiously. The Australian Industry Group, which opposes labour market testing, said it would be open to supporting Labor\u2019s push to enshrine the rules in legislation \u201cif the measures did not add to existing requirements or make them more onerous\u201d. The Business Council of Australia said while it believed amendments were unnecessary, the main parties should reach an agreement on any measures that \u201cdo not detract from the spirit of the agreement unnecessarily, or add to cost and complexity\u201d. But the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry called on the government to hold its ground and resist the \u201cshamefully opportunistic\u201d union-driven amendments.",

      "body": "<p>The Turnbull government appears set to reach a deal to secure passage of the China-Australia free trade agreement (Chafta) after it vowed to consider the opposition\u2019s demands \u201cin good faith\u201d in a bid to resolve the long-running political dispute.</p> <p>On Tuesday the federal Labor party signed off on its proposed amendments to the Migration Act, which would form the basis of negotiations with the government aimed at passing legislation necessary to implement Chafta.</p> <p>The trade minister, Andrew Robb, signalled that the government was prepared to accept changes, so long as the measures did not discriminate against China or breach the text of the agreement.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ll have genuine discussions with the Labor party and hopefully it will identify a pathway to get these things through the parliament,\u201d Robb said.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.alp.org.au/chinaftasafeguards\">Labor\u2019s proposals</a> include a mandatory requirement for employers to try to find local workers before seeking overseas labour under the 457 visa scheme.</p> <p>They would also increase the minimum base pay for foreign workers from $53,900 to $57,000 and would ensure tradespeople obtained the required occupational licence as a visa condition.</p> <p>Labor says the labour-market-testing rule would apply to employers using work agreements, which include the Chafta-negotiated arrangements for major development projects in Australia, but because they have broader effect they are \u201cnon-discriminatory\u201d.</p> <p>The amendments \u2013 which were discussed at a caucus meeting on Tuesday \u2013 represent an attempt by Labor\u2019s leader, Bill Shorten, and trade spokeswoman, Penny Wong, to overcome the intense political dispute over Chafta.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2015/sep/29/china-free-trade-agreement-must-not-slip-through-our-fingers-official-warns\">China free trade agreement must not 'slip through our fingers', official warns</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Labor is hopeful of reaching a deal with Malcolm Turnbull, who has signalled the government is open to talks with Labor about any specific proposals. The former prime minister, Tony Abbott, had ruled out such talks on the basis that \u201cthere is nothing to negotiate\u201d.</p> <p>Shorten said the opposition had crafted its amendments in a way that did not require a reopening of negotiations with Beijing on the treaty text, but would \u201cmake sure that all Australians can be winners out of a China free trade agreement\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cToday we urge Malcolm Turnbull and the government to come to the table to deal with a range of concerns that have been put forward and then we can all successfully support the China free trade agreement,\u201d he said.</p> <p>It is understood seven Labor MPs or senators called for the party to take a stronger line when they addressed the caucus meeting on Tuesday. Five others spoke in favour of the party\u2019s proposed position, which was ultimately adopted.</p> <p>The long caucus debate was said to be \u201crobust and hard-fought\u201d.</p> <p>Some members of the Labor caucus were concerned about Chafta including an investor-state dispute settlement mechanism that allowed companies to sue the government. They were also worried about the consequences of the chapter dealing with the movement of natural persons.</p> <p>But Wong said there were limits to what could be done about the chapter because it was in the text of the agreement. Labor had proposed lifting the base pay as a way of dealing with the potential issue of exploitation of foreign workers, she told reporters after the meeting.</p> <p>Wong said while the Labor party may have concerns about aspects of Chafta, \u201cwe recognise as a responsible opposition that we have to work within the framework of the existing agreement\u201d.<br></p> <p>Wong emphasised that the proposed changes were merely an \u201cexposure draft\u201d \u2013 a position that appeared to leave the door open to shifting ground on the details in forthcoming negotiations with the government.</p> <p>\u201cThey would enable, if the negotiation is successful, bipartisan support for the China free trade agreement, which we believe is in the national interest,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Wong would not say whether Labor would seek to block the Chafta legislation if the government blocked any of the proposed amendments.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ll go through that process of negotiation and consultation and if we\u2019re not in a position to finalise those prior to the House [of Representatives] discussion then obviously we\u2019ll move them in the Senate,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Unions were pushing for Labor to take a hard line against the foreign worker provisions in the deal, and were accused by the government of running a xenophobic campaign. The union movement insisted the concerns were legitimate.</p> <p>The government wants to pass the Chafta implementation legislation before the end of the year so Australian companies can gain the benefit of two rounds of tariff cuts in quick succession.</p> <p>Robb said the government had yet to study Labor\u2019s proposals in detail but would have \u201cgenuine discussions\u201d with the opposition soon. <br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>The trade minister played down the significance of the proposed changes, saying it was already government policy to require labour market testing for workers on major projects worth $150m and above. Labor wanted this to be protected in legislation rather than as a matter of policy.</p> <p>\u201cAt first glance, the things that they are asking for either provide clarity or they provide greater comfort to existing measures,\u201d Robb said.</p> <p>He argued that if the government accepted amendments it would not amount to a concession that there were problems in the original agreement. This was because Labor had conceded that the substance of Chafta could not be changed, Robb said.</p> <p>The Greens senator Peter Whish-Wilson said the proposed amendments were \u201csimply playing around the edges\u201d and would not stop Chafta from driving down wages and working conditions. </p> <p>\u201cBy not attempting to fix chapter 10 of Chafta, Labor is accepting the need to remove labour market testing for contractual service providers,\u201d Whish-Wilson said. \u201cThis covers a wide range of occupations, from IT technicians to cleaners. Labor may have sought to increase the wage threshold for Chinese contractual service providers, but in many circumstances this will still be well below Australian award rates.\u201d</p> <p>The Australian Council of Trade Unions said the amendments were \u201ca step in the right direction\u201d but there were \u201cstill some details that need improvement\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cWe look forward to the opportunity to work with the ALP, the government and crossbenches to that end,\u201d said the president of the peak union body, Ged Kearney.</p> <p>\u201cWe will continue to discuss our concerns until we are convinced that workers\u2019 jobs are protected.\u201d</p> <p>The Electrical Trades Union, which was one of the main unions campaigning against Chafta, also stopped short of expressing immediate support for Labor\u2019s position.</p> <p>A spokesman said the ETU was \u201ccurrently reviewing\u201d the proposed amendments and was hopeful of achieving \u201cmeaningful and effective safeguards for Australian jobs and conditions, as well as protections for worker safety and migrant workers\u201d.</p> <p>Several business groups reacted cautiously.</p> <p>The Australian Industry Group, which opposes labour market testing, said it would be open to supporting Labor\u2019s push to enshrine the rules in legislation \u201cif the measures did not add to existing requirements or make them more onerous\u201d.</p> <p>The Business Council of Australia said while it believed amendments were unnecessary, the main parties should reach an agreement on any measures that \u201cdo not detract from the spirit of the agreement unnecessarily, or add to cost and complexity\u201d.</p> <p>But the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry called on the government to hold its ground and resist the \u201cshamefully opportunistic\u201d union-driven amendments.</p>",
