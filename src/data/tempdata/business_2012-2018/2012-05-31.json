    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "\"You've got to be a player. What's the point of being in business if you can't be a player?\" So said Mick Davis in a famous speech in 2009. He was referring to the need to reload Xstrata's coffers via a rights issue after the bust in commodity prices. But the quote also reveals much about how Xstrata's management regard themselves. They think the creation of the company in 2002, and its subsequent growth via acquisition over the past decade, was a supreme act of value-creation that could only have been achieved by a uniquely talented set of managers that dared to think big. They think they're players \u2013 and they expect to be paid as such. Xstrata's non-executive directors, including new-boy chairman Sir John Bond, appear to share this assessment that the executives are God's gift to mining investors. Thus the colossal sum of \u00a3172m is being offered to Davis and 72 others to persuade them to stay after the merger with Glencore. To earn these sums the happy band is not required to clear any performance hurdles. The individuals simply have to stay in their posts for two years, or three in Davis's case. The arrangement stinks. It breaches the spirit of all Davis's boasts over many years that the interests of Xstrata's managers are aligned perfectly with those of shareholders. In that 2009 speech about the \"value of our values\" Davis also claimed that \"the value of alignment and true incentivisation sits at the heart of our organisation\". If that were ever true, it's not now. True incentivisation does not mean a payment of an extra \u00a39.6m a year for turning up after a merger. Yes, Davis also owns \u00a325m of Xstrata shares which will convert into stock in the merged company. And, yes, he'll also have the standard paraphernalia of multimillion-pound incentives to hit certain targets. But, come on, a three-year retention award of almost \u00a330m sets an appalling precedent. What if the next piece of empire-building is a bid to buy Anglo-American, as some suspect? Would shareholders have to sanction even greater awards to attempt that adventure? It might be said that Davis's millions wouldn't win bragging rights in a Zug wine bar if his fellow drinkers were Ivan Glasenberg and the billionaires at the top of Glencore. That's true, but there's a difference. Glasenberg built his fortune within a partnership, as Glencore was until last year. Davis was managing outsiders' capital as the chief executive of a public company. Has he been a successful manager of that capital? Yes \u2013 but not to the degree that the Xstrata myth-makers tend to claim. As an investor, you've done very nicely if you bought into the vision when the company was created to acquire Glencore's coal assets in 2002. But don't be overly dazzled by the statistic that Xstrata has grown from a \u00a3500m company to one worth \u00a328bn today: an awful lot of shares were issued along the way to fund acquisitions. The current share price of 922.5p was first seen as long ago as April 2006. At the top of the commodities market in 2008-09 Xstrata, like Rio Tinto, was exposed as horribly over-borrowed. Davis was even adding to the leverage by attempting an aggressive takeover of platinum miner Lonmin as commodity prices went into meltdown. Even he conceded afterwards that he had \"abused the capital base a tinge\". You bet: that two-for-one rights issue to raise \u00a34.1bn at the bottom of the market in 2009 stands as a reminder that Davis misread the commodities cycle. He's a player, but he doesn't always win. And now he can collect almost \u00a330m regardless of how the Glencore deal turns out. Bond, with the calamitous Household acquisition as a scar on his record at HSBC, ought to know better.",

      "body": "<p>Logica has agreed to sell itself to CGI of Canada at 105p a share, or 60% more than yesterday's market price, which sounds terrific until you remember that the shares traded above 110p almost every day from autumn 2009 to summer 2011. Viewed against that backdrop, Logica is giving up its independence without a fight. Where's the ambition?</p> <p>It has disappeared down the black hole of the eurozone, it seems. Two profits warnings in 12 months, coupled with no sign of a pick-up in demand for IT services in Europe, have sapped spirits. Logica has cut jobs but there's no escaping the fact that Europe's public sector (28% of revenues last year) and its financial services industry (16%) won't be increasing IT budgets meaningfully any time soon. That's the case for seeking protection under CGI's umbrella. And, when your two largest shareholders \u2013 Schroders and Artemis, with a combined 18% \u2013 want to take the cash, the hands of Logica's directors were partially forced.</p> <p>But one has to admire CGI's willingness to take an opportunistic gamble on the eurozone.

      "bodyText": "Logica has agreed to sell itself to CGI of Canada at 105p a share, or 60% more than yesterday's market price, which sounds terrific until you remember that the shares traded above 110p almost every day from autumn 2009 to summer 2011. Viewed against that backdrop, Logica is giving up its independence without a fight. Where's the ambition? It has disappeared down the black hole of the eurozone, it seems. Two profits warnings in 12 months, coupled with no sign of a pick-up in demand for IT services in Europe, have sapped spirits. Logica has cut jobs but there's no escaping the fact that Europe's public sector (28% of revenues last year) and its financial services industry (16%) won't be increasing IT budgets meaningfully any time soon. That's the case for seeking protection under CGI's umbrella. And, when your two largest shareholders \u2013 Schroders and Artemis, with a combined 18% \u2013 want to take the cash, the hands of Logica's directors were partially forced. But one has to admire CGI's willingness to take an opportunistic gamble on the eurozone. The acquisition is a big bet for it. CGI is worth C$5.4bn, or \u00a33.4bn, which is twice as much as the value of its bid for Logica. But the Canadian firm is actually smaller than Logica in terms of both numbers of employees (40,000 versus 31,000) and revenues.

These will be transferred into Glencore shares and will not involve cash payments.</p> <p>He is the only key member of staff to be on a retention package that lasts for three years, with the rest on two-year deals. Finance director Trevor Reid gets \u00a35.4m a year in 2013 and 2014, \u00a35.4m for the change of control agreement in 2012 and a potential \u00a33.2m through the long-term incentive plan.</p> <p>The only other director whose individual payouts are included in the shareholder circular is</p> <p>Santiago Zaldumbide, who gets \u00a34m in 2013 and 2014 as retention payments, \u00a34m under the contractual arrangements and a potential \u00a32.6m through the long-term incentive plan. The directors also have options which are currently \"under water\" \u2013 worthless at current values \u2013 and which will transfer into Glencore shares.</p> <p>The documents contained no indication that the terms of the offer \u2013 under which Glencore is offering 2.8 of its shares for one in Xstrata \u2013 was being raised. That is despite protestations from leading shareholders in Xstrata who were demanding a higher price from Glencore, which already owns 34% of the mining company.</p> <p>The transaction has a hurdle rate of 75% and Glencore cannot vote its stake while the vote on the retention packages has a 50% pass rate. City sources believe the deal stands a good chance of getting through as Qatar Investment Authority sovereign wealth fund has tripled its stake in Xstrata to more than 9%.</p> <p>Xstrata shareholders began to demonstrate their frustration at the takeover at the annual meeting early in May when 13% of them voted against the re-election to the board of Ivan Glasenberg, the Glencore boss who has a seat because of the trading company's shareholding.</p> <p>There was also a 19% protest vote against non-executive director David Rough, who chairs the remuneration committee, and a rebellion against the remuneration report.</p> <p>Rough, a former top fund manager, will not have a seat on the combined board which will be chaired by current Xstrata chairman Sir John Bond. There is also no role for the Glencore chairman Simon Murray.</p> <p>Bond said that the \"strategic logic\" for combining the two companies was \"compelling\". \"The merger brings together two highly successful and entrepreneurial management teams to form a major, integrated natural resources group,\" Bond said.</p> <p>The flotation of Glencore last year had long been regarded as motivated to secure a tie-up with Xstrata</p>",

Finance director Trevor Reid gets \u00a35.4m a year in 2013 and 2014, \u00a35.4m for the change of control agreement in 2012 and a potential \u00a33.2m through the long-term incentive plan. The only other director whose individual payouts are included in the shareholder circular is Santiago Zaldumbide, who gets \u00a34m in 2013 and 2014 as retention payments, \u00a34m under the contractual arrangements and a potential \u00a32.6m through the long-term incentive plan. The directors also have options which are currently \"under water\" \u2013 worthless at current values \u2013 and which will transfer into Glencore shares. The documents contained no indication that the terms of the offer \u2013 under which Glencore is offering 2.8 of its shares for one in Xstrata \u2013 was being raised. That is despite protestations from leading shareholders in Xstrata who were demanding a higher price from Glencore, which already owns 34% of the mining company. The transaction has a hurdle rate of 75% and Glencore cannot vote its stake while the vote on the retention packages has a 50% pass rate. City sources believe the deal stands a good chance of getting through as Qatar Investment Authority sovereign wealth fund has tripled its stake in Xstrata to more than 9%. Xstrata shareholders began to demonstrate their frustration at the takeover at the annual meeting early in May when 13% of them voted against the re-election to the board of Ivan Glasenberg, the Glencore boss who has a seat because of the trading company's shareholding. There was also a 19% protest vote against non-executive director David Rough, who chairs the remuneration committee, and a rebellion against the remuneration report. Rough, a former top fund manager, will not have a seat on the combined board which will be chaired by current Xstrata chairman Sir John Bond. There is also no role for the Glencore chairman Simon Murray. Bond said that the \"strategic logic\" for combining the two companies was \"compelling\". \"The merger brings together two highly successful and entrepreneurial management teams to form a major, integrated natural resources group,\" Bond said. The flotation of Glencore last year had long been regarded as motivated to secure a tie-up with Xstrata",

The TV advertising market could be down 10% or more in July, with ITV Family slightly ahead of this; for August, there is a smaller decline (market down around 5% and ITV family down 3%-4%) with a smaller still decline in September ( down 2% market, down 1% ITV Family).

Legal &amp; General said it had reduced its shareholding from 3.95% to below 3% after a share sale on Tuesday. The news has sent the broadcaster 3.3p lower to 74p. Meanwhile Ian Whittaker at Liberum Capital said that conversations with media buyers suggested July and August may be difficult months. Even though the company dislikes the market's fixation with such short term signs, Whittaker said: The indications we are hearing suggest the July and August TV advertising markets may be weaker than expected with reports some advertisers have cancelled planned campaigns. The TV advertising market could be down 10% or more in July, with ITV Family slightly ahead of this; for August, there is a smaller decline (market down around 5% and ITV family down 3%-4%) with a smaller still decline in September ( down 2% market, down 1% ITV Family). This would imply ITV Family down around 4% or more in the third quarter versus earlier indications of 4% growth. Elsewhere Admiral has fallen 19p to \u00a311 after the Office of Fair Trading provisionally called for an investigation of the car insurance market by the Competition Commission. Andy Hughes at Exane BNP Paribas said: We expect prices to fall to reflect the lower cost of claims in future putting more pressure on Admiral's revenue - we remain underweight. We believe Admiral is significantly overvalued and our target price [of 835p] reflects 25% downside.",
