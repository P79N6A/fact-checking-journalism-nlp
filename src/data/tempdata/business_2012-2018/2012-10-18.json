They also say retaliation for speaking out is common, which also results in lost wages.</p> <p>After the suit was first filed, Bailey said, he was sent home early from his shift, seeing his pay packet cut. Another Roadlink worker at Elwood who is joining the complaint, Holly Kent-Payne, 25, said that she has simply not been paid for one day's work. \"My first pay check, they did not pay me for a whole day. That's a whole day of my life gone,\" she said.</p> <p>A spokesman for RWS declined to comment on the case.</p> <p>But the suit against Roadlink is just the tip of the iceberg. Since 2009 there have been five other suits filed against five different staffing companies which feed workers into the 3.4m sq ft Elwood warehouse. Of those cases, two have been confidentially settled. They, too, described wage theft.</p> <h2>'It is not easy to get by'</h2> <p>Leticia Rodrigues worked at Elwood at the end of last year. She says she found herself often being paid by the task \u2013 effectively per truck or shipment of goods. Often jobs were so large she had to get other workers to help or take extra hours on her own time. That meant her wages dipped below the legal hourly minimum. \"It would happen two or three days out of a four day week,\" she said.</p> <p>Robert Hines, who worked at Elwood in 2010, also says he was a victim of wage theft at Elwood. He described being asked to show up when no work was forthcoming. Hines says he was summoned into the warehouse, getting up at 4.30am to arrive at 5.30am, and was then finally being inspected by managers at 7am. Then, he says, he \u2013 along with most other workers brought in \u2013 were sent home, as all the available shifts had been doled out. There was no compensation for their time. </p> <p>\"I felt like an idiot. That's my time. That's less money to feed my family, less money to put clothes on their backs,\" said Hines, 39.</p> <p>There is little doubt that the workforce recruited for the warehouse industry \u2013 whether in Illinois or in other major hubs like New Jersey or the Inland Empire in California \u2013 is highly vulnerable. Many do not stay on the job for longer than a couple months. Few last a year.</p> <p>Mike Compton, 36, works in Elwood but has spent time living in abandoned houses in Joliet. \"I found one abandoned house that had working electricity still. And a fridge,\" he said. He reckons that if he worked all 52 weeks of the year \u2013 he has no paid vacation \u2013 he would bring home a total annual salary of just $15,000. \"It is not easy to get by,\" said Compton.</p> <p>Workers' rights campaigners say the Walmart supply chain is set up in a way that makes wage theft likely. They say Walmart's vast commercial power and relentless focus on driving down costs squeezes the margins of firms it subcontracts its supply chain out to. Those firms, in turn, squeeze their own subcontractors as they eke out a profit. At the bottom of this process are the workers.</p> <p>The Elwood warehouse, for example, only shifts Walmart goods. But it is run by logistics giant Schneider. In turn, Schneider outsources most staffing to recruitment agencies. Those layers of outsourcing, critics say, have led to an exploitative industry where wage theft becomes part of the system.</p> <p>\"There are lots of low-skilled, low-paid workers and its easy for employers to chisel away at them. Wage theft is rampant in this industry. It is a perfect storm for wage theft,\" said Cathy Ruckelshaus, an expert on the warehousing industry at the National Employment Law Project.</p> <p>Leah Fried, an activist with Warehouse Workers for Justice which is seeking to organise warehouse employees in Elwood, was more blunt. \"Is it their business model to rob people? Because it seems that way,\" she said.</p> <h2>A good business model?</h2> <p>Stopping that practice is the aim behind the repeated lawsuits against wage theft. Chicago lawyer Chris Williams, who lodged the Roadlink suit, said such legal steps were often the only recourse for workers unaware of their rights or afraid to speak out. \"The hope is Walmart and its subcontractors will decide this is not a good business model because they keep getting sued,\" he said.</p> <p>Schneider spokeswoman Janet Bonkowski said the firm held its subcontractors to high standards. \"When we utilise third-party vendors, we contractually require full compliance with all required laws and that all parties conduct business ethically,\" she said.</p> <p>Walmart spokesman Dan Fogleman pointed out that Walmart was not named in the RWS suit and had taken steps to police standards in its supply chain. \"We take allegations of workplace issues very seriously,\" he said. Fogleman added the company had not uncovered any systemic problems, but is drawing up a protocol for third-party run warehouses in the future that will include random inspections by an independent group.</p> <p>But there has already been worker unrest at Elwood. Recently hundreds of workers and supporters gathered outside the gates of the gigantic facility and held a rally. Police in riot gear were called and several people were arrested, including local religious leader Pastor Craig Purchase.</p> <p>\"The system is a modern version of sweatshop labour from the early days. I had to get involved,\" he said. His arrest was the first time he had ever been detained by police.</p> <p>Elsewhere in the US, conditions in the outsourced parts of the Walmart supply chain have also been the focus of protest. In the Inland Empire in California, a lawsuit was launched at a Schneider-run warehouse in Mira Loma that alleged wage theft by staffing agencies hired by the company to recruit workers.</p> <p>At other warehouses in southern California, unsafe working conditions have been the subject of complaints to the state's labour board, and there have also been walkouts, strikes, and a six-day \"march to the sea\" by scores of warehouse workers trying to highlight their complaints.</p> <p>Critics say that Walmart has a responsibility to these workers, even though it keeps responsibility for them at arm's length by layers of subcontracting. \"Walmart knows there is a problem,\" said Ruckelshaus.</p> <p>Certainly Bailey sees Walmart as the ultimate beneficiary of the wages he says are lost to Roadlink. The sums are not much \u2013 just a few dollars here and there as hours are rounded down or he is summoned for work and then turned away. But for him, already caught in desperately hard times, they mean an immense amount. \"It is a big chunk of change for someone in my circumstances,\" he said. \"It is my money, but they treat us like prison labour.\"</p>",

Elsewhere in the US, conditions in the outsourced parts of the Walmart supply chain have also been the focus of protest. In the Inland Empire in California, a lawsuit was launched at a Schneider-run warehouse in Mira Loma that alleged wage theft by staffing agencies hired by the company to recruit workers. At other warehouses in southern California, unsafe working conditions have been the subject of complaints to the state's labour board, and there have also been walkouts, strikes, and a six-day \"march to the sea\" by scores of warehouse workers trying to highlight their complaints. Critics say that Walmart has a responsibility to these workers, even though it keeps responsibility for them at arm's length by layers of subcontracting. \"Walmart knows there is a problem,\" said Ruckelshaus. Certainly Bailey sees Walmart as the ultimate beneficiary of the wages he says are lost to Roadlink. The sums are not much \u2013 just a few dollars here and there as hours are rounded down or he is summoned for work and then turned away. But for him, already caught in desperately hard times, they mean an immense amount. \"It is a big chunk of change for someone in my circumstances,\" he said. \"It is my money, but they treat us like prison labour.\"",

      "bodyText": "Starbucks could face angry protests on Saturday after pressure group UK Uncut said it planned to start targeting the coffee chain's stores. The group, which has previously organised sit-ins at Vodafone shops and at upmarket grocer Fortnum &amp; Mason, will be meeting outside St Paul's in London on Saturday morning under the banner \"no cuts, no tax-dodging\", before joining a TUC march through central London against the government's austerity programme. However, Starbucks said it has no plans to close any of its central London locations, including the branch directly opposite where the protesters will be meeting. At the same time as campaigners were planning protests, train operator CrossCountry said it might stop selling Starbucks coffee on its services, and a new poll found that the coffee firm's brand identity had taken a \"disastrous\" hit from the revelations that has paid just \u00a38.6m in tax since launching in the UK 14 years ago. Bosses at the company are thought to have been in contact with HM Revenue and Customs to clarify its tax position. On Thursday, HMRC estimated that, under its definition of what constitutes tax avoidance, \u00a35bn had been lost last year \u2014 the same amount as for 2009-10. UK Uncut, which organised a sit-in at Vodafone's most high-profile London store in 2010, had always planned to join the TUC march to protest against government cuts Anna Walker, a spokesperson for UK Uncut, said: \"Companies such as Starbucks are definitely targets in our sights for future protests. UK Uncut's previous sit-ins and occupations in the branches of tax dodgers have proved very effective in highlighting the unjust practices of big business.\" The organisation last hit the headlines in the summer after activists attempted to storm the offices of healthcare assessor company Atos. A spokesperson for Starbucks said: \"Obviously, the safety of our staff is paramount, but we currently have no plans to close stores in central London over the weekend.\" Starbucks has rung up total sales of \u00a33bn in the UK since opening its first store in 1998, but has recorded a loss for every year since it started trading in Britain, despite US management claiming it had been a \"profitable\" marketplace. On Thursday, YouGov's BrandIndex, which records the strength of companies' brand identity, revealed Starbucks has plummeted in the past few days. Its \"buzz\" score, which measures the number of negative and positive comments customers have heard, reached a four-year low, falling to -13.9 from +0.7. Its reputation score has also fallen from 4.6 a week ago to -3.9 on Thursday and could continue to drop. Sarah Murphy of BrandIndex said: \"To say this story has been a disaster for the Starbucks brand would be a bit of an understatement. It's still too early to say what the long-term impact of this is going to be, but in the current climate we've seen the public take a fairly dim view towards accusations of corporate greed.\" CrossCountry, which operates between Aberdeen and Penzance, said: \"If our customers were to tell us they were unhappy for us to sell them Starbucks coffee then we would, of course, review this arrangement.\" Starbucks UK's managing director, Kris Engskov, tried to justify the company's position in a blog post on the company's website. In an initial version he wrote: \"The most important thing to understand is that Starbucks does pay tax in the UK. Indeed over the last three years we have paid over \u00a3160m in various taxes, including Pay As You Earn for our 8,500 UK employees, national insurance and business rates.\" The post was subsequently changed to remove the reference to PAYE, which is a tax on employees' earnings, not on businesses, but the figure of \u00a3160m remained. The company said \u00a387m of that was VAT \u2013 which is a tax on consumers. Several MPs have called for an inquiry into Starbucks' tax affairs, which are considered perfectly legal, and for HMRC to answer questions over its relationship with the company. \u2022 This article was corrected on 2 December to include only the figure for the HMRC definition of tax avoidance. The earlier version referred to the total figure for the tax gap.",

    "webTitle": "UK economy still ailing, warns Bank of England insider", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The Bank of England's most consistent inflation \"dove\" has made the case for a fresh boost to demand, warning that the prospect for the UK remains a period of sub-par economic growth and weak inflationary pressure. David Miles, one of the nine members of Threadneedle Street's monetary policy committee (MPC), said that even though the level of stimulus being provided by the Bank was already \"off the scale\", there was no evidence that the economy was overheating. Speaking to the Guardian, Miles said: \"The state of the economy is not as good as I had hoped a year or so back, I must admit. The last 18 months have seen no significant growth\". He added that there were three main reasons why the economy had underperformed: the impact of higher-than-expected inflation on consumer spending power; the dampening effect on exports of the crisis in the eurozone; and the reluctance of companies to invest. The big squeeze on real incomes was now largely over, Miles said, but the outlook was for a period of steady, unspectacular growth rather than the surge in output witnessed in the aftermath of previous recessions. He rejected the idea that inflationary pressures were building up as a result of the Bank's policy since early 2009 of keeping its key lending rate down at 0.5% and pumping \u00a3375bn into the economy through quantitative easing (QE), the programme of asset purchases that leads to an expansion in money supply. \"I don't hear many of the warning bells ringing,\" he said. \"If, after a period when wage settlements have been very steady at 2%, they moved up through 2.5%, 3%, 4% and companies were looking at 5% or 6% increases, that would be a pretty strong warning sign. But that's not where we are.\" The MPC announced a programme of \u00a350bn worth of asset sales in August, having decided that inflation would drop back to its 2% target by the end of the year, and fall below it during 2013. The committee will consider whether inflation is likely to be below target over the next two years when it meets next month to decide whether to further expand the scheme. \"If that's where we are and it looks likely that inflation will undershoot, then that's a reason to make monetary policy more expansionary,\" Miles said. He added that it had been right to keep monetary policy \"super-expansionary\" given the amount of spare capacity in the economy. \"The best guide to the most likely outcome [for inflation] is to be had by focusing on domestic inflationary pressures. They have been pretty weak and remain so.\" Miles expressed strong doubts about the use of \"helicopter money\" \u2013 cash payments dropped directly into the laps of consumers in the hope of boosting spending, financed by the Bank printing money. QE, he said, performed much the same purpose but had the advantage that it could be reversed if and when inflationary pressures started to become evident. Asked how long the Bank would have to continue its ultra-loose policy, Miles said: \"When I first joined the MPC more than three years ago, I would have said until about now. That turned out to be far too optimistic.\" \"There are reasons to think that we may be getting back to consistently positive growth over the next few years,\" he added; however, this would probably be below the economy's long-term trend growth rate, which is thought to be between 2% and 2.5%. He said his concern was that capital would be permanently scrapped and workers would lose their skills if the recession went on and on. A long period of slow growth, Miles said, would remove the spare capacity in the economy. \"But it would be removed in a bad way, where capacity is eroded and withers.\" Infrastructure boost Some of Britain's biggest occupational pension schemes have answered the Treasury's call for them to back a major boost in spending on infrastructure projects. Six schemes have become \"founding investors\" in the Pension Infrastructure Platform, after indicating they could spend \u00a3100m each. George Osborne said in the budget that he wanted pension funds to step in to support infrastructure spending. The initial investors are the pension funds for BT and BAE, the Railways Pension Scheme, the government backed Pension Protection Fund (PPF) and local authority schemes from Strathclyde and the West Midlands. The PPF and the National Association of Pension Funds said talks were under way to hammer out a structure that limits the risk of cost overruns, which has traditionally discouraged schemes from investing in infrastructure.

      "body": "<p>The Bank of England's most consistent inflation \"dove\" has made the case for a fresh boost to demand, warning that the prospect for the UK remains a period of sub-par economic growth and weak inflationary pressure.</p> <p>David Miles, one of the nine members of Threadneedle Street's monetary policy committee (MPC), said that even though the level of stimulus being provided by the Bank was already \"off the scale\", there was no evidence that the economy was overheating.</p> <p>Speaking to the Guardian, Miles said: \"The state of the economy is not as good as I had hoped a year or so back, I must admit. The last 18 months have seen no significant growth\".</p> <p>He added that there were three main reasons why the economy had underperformed: the impact of higher-than-expected inflation on consumer spending power; the dampening effect on exports of the crisis in the eurozone; and the reluctance of companies to invest.</p> <p>The big squeeze on real incomes was now largely over, Miles said, but the outlook was for a period of steady, unspectacular growth rather than the surge in output witnessed in the aftermath of previous recessions. He rejected the idea that inflationary pressures were building up as a result of the Bank's policy since early 2009 of keeping its key lending rate down at 0.5% and pumping \u00a3375bn into the economy through quantitative easing (QE), the programme of asset purchases that leads to an expansion in money supply.</p> <p>\"I don't hear many of the warning bells ringing,\" he said. \"If, after a period when wage settlements have been very steady at 2%, they moved up through 2.5%, 3%, 4% and companies were looking at 5% or 6% increases, that would be a pretty strong warning sign. But that's not where we are.\"</p> <p>The MPC announced a programme of \u00a350bn worth of asset sales in August, having decided that inflation would drop back to its 2% target by the end of the year, and fall below it during 2013. The committee will consider whether inflation is likely to be below target over the next two years when it meets next month to decide whether to further expand the scheme.</p> <p>\"If that's where we are and it looks likely that inflation will undershoot, then that's a reason to make monetary policy more expansionary,\" Miles said. He added that it had been right to keep monetary policy \"super-expansionary\" given the amount of spare capacity in the economy.</p> <p>\"The best guide to the most likely outcome [for inflation] is to be had by focusing on domestic inflationary pressures. They have been pretty weak and remain so.\"</p> <p>Miles expressed strong doubts about the use of \"helicopter money\" \u2013 cash payments dropped directly into the laps of consumers in the hope of boosting spending, financed by the Bank printing money. QE, he said, performed much the same purpose but had the advantage that it could be reversed if and when inflationary pressures started to become evident.</p> <p>Asked how long the Bank would have to continue its ultra-loose policy, Miles said: \"When I first joined the MPC more than three years ago, I would have said until about now. That turned out to be far too optimistic.\"</p> <p>\"There are reasons to think that we may be getting back to consistently positive growth over the next few years,\" he added; however, this would probably be below the economy's long-term trend growth rate, which is thought to be between 2% and 2.5%.</p> <p>He said his concern was that capital would be permanently scrapped and workers would lose their skills if the recession went on and on. A long period of slow growth, Miles said, would remove the spare capacity in the economy. \"But it would be removed in a bad way, where capacity is eroded and withers.\"</p> <h2>Infrastructure boost</h2> <p>Some of Britain's biggest occupational pension schemes have answered the Treasury's call for them to back a major boost in spending on infrastructure projects.</p> <p>Six schemes have become \"founding investors\" in the Pension Infrastructure Platform, after indicating they could spend \u00a3100m each.</p> <p>George Osborne said in the budget that he wanted pension funds to step in to support infrastructure spending.</p> <p>The initial investors are the pension funds for BT and BAE, the Railways Pension Scheme, the government backed Pension Protection Fund (PPF) and local authority schemes from Strathclyde and the West Midlands.</p> <p>The PPF and the National Association of Pension Funds said talks were under way to hammer out a structure that limits the risk of cost overruns, which has traditionally discouraged schemes from investing in infrastructure. <strong>Phillip Inman</strong></p>",

The managing director of Starbucks UK is stumbling around chaotically as he tries in blogs and TV interviews to defend the company's tax position over here. Poor old Engskov is throwing out irrelevant facts in the hope that a few stick in the minds of consumers. Thus he boasts about sums paid in national insurance contributions, VAT and business rates, and then grumbles about the UK being \"one of the most competitive places to sell coffee in the world\". It's all beside the point. The criticism of Starbucks is that it has championed the success and profits of its UK operation in corporate statements but then minimised its UK corporation tax bill through a variety of techniques \u2013 all perfectly legal. The original Reuters investigation said this \"licence to lose money\" worked in three ways: via royalty payments to a Dutch-based Starbucks company that pays some of its revenue to another Starbucks unit in Switzerland; via purchasing coffee beans from a Swiss-based trading unit; and via high-cost debt financing provided by the US parent. That's the detail of the story that Engskov hasn't addressed. It's common practice to pay royalties for the use of a brand, but why is Starbucks UK's set at a steep 6% of revenue and why do some of the payments appear to end up in Switzerland? Similarly, is the UK business paying commercial rates for its coffee beans and debt? Engskov, we must assume, won't tread on that territory because it lies above his pay grade. He doesn't decide Starbucks' transfer-pricing arrangements and nor, probably, is he free to seek a better a deal on debt than the Libor-plus-4% that arrives from Seattle. In other words, this is a problem of the tax advantages enjoyed by multinationals, as Richard Murphy has analysed here. That being so, if our MPs get round to summoning a Starbucks representative to appear before various committees, they should insist on Schultz, or at least one of his board-level lieutenants. It is only a Seattle bigwig who can explain why the firm thinks its policies in the UK are morally legitimate. If the answer is \"everybody's at it, just look at Google, Amazon, Apple, Facebook\", that might serve as a useful wake-up call for parliament.

Retail sales volumes rose 0.6% in September following a 0.1% dip in August, according to the Office for National Statistics. City economists had pencilled in a 0.4% rise. Sales were 1% higher between July and September than in the previous three months, the strongest quarterly rise since mid-2010. This bodes well for economic growth in the third quarter, suggesting that Britain came out of recession again after three quarters of contraction. Many families bought school uniforms in September because schools started later than last year after the summer break, and shoppers also snapped up retailers' new winter collections, the statistics office said. It had no evidence of an Olympics effect, although larger shops had reported some disruption in August during the Games, while sports goods and toy stores enjoyed a surge in sales. Clothes and shoe sales climbed 2% in September, while household goods were up 1.1%. The release of the eagerly awaited iPhone 5 also appears to have boosted spending, with computer and telecoms sales up 7.6%. \"Such resilience in the month after the Olympics ended is further evidence of the event's irrelevance as a stimulative force,\" said Philip Rush, UK economist at Nomura. \"Extra signs of strength in the durable items are particularly encouraging as it shows greater willingness of consumers to spend on high-ticket items.

Household incomes have been squeezed over the past year as wages failed to keep up with inflation, with the gap at over 3% a year ago, but Wednesday's data showed the gap has narrowed considerably. Regular pay, excluding bonuses, rose by 2% in the three months to August while inflation fell back to 2.2% last month. However, inflation could pick up again in coming months owing to utility price hikes. Richard Lowe, head of retail and wholesale at Barclays, said: \"Seasonal weather is encouraging shoppers back into stores as consumers pile on the layers ready for the winter months. The falling temperatures, however, may see consumers being more cautious in the face of rising utility bills.\" The high street has been hit hard by Britain's double-dip recession.

      "bodyText": "Dulux-maker AkzoNobel has warned of a long road back to recovery in Europe as it took a big writedown on its decorative paints business, pushing the world's largest paints company deep into the red. The Anglo-Dutch group blamed a 3% drop in sales volumes on the economic slowdown in Europe. A spokesman explained that cash-strapped consumers were not moving house, and not fixing dents in their cars to save money. The Amsterdam-based company acquired the Dulux brand - famous for its shaggy-haired dog ads - when it took over ICI in 2008. On Thursday it wrote down the value of its decorative paints division by \u20ac2.5bn (\u00a32bn), resulting in a net loss of \u20ac2.4bn for the third quarter. Europe accounted for the majority of the writedown, \u20ac1.9bn, with another \u20ac400m written down in North America and \u20ac200m in South America. Decorative paints generated revenues of \u20ac1.46bn, little changed from a year earlier. The tough market in Europe and Latin America was largely offset by strong performances in China and northern Asia. Even so, AkzoNobel has been able to hold on to or increase its market share in most of its markets. The company's finance chief, Keith Nichols, said: \"The principal concern remains the decorative paint markets in Europe. The impairment taken in this quarter is a reflection of these concerns and our realistic assessment of the markets going forward. As we cannot expect quick recovery of the economy, we also will continue to implement our ongoing improvement agenda in order to increase our profitability.\" The firm's chief executive, Ton B\u00fcchner, has been on medical leave and is expected to return to work around the end of the year. Berenberg analyst Jaideep Pandya said: \"With the \u20ac2.4bn write-down, Akzo Nobel has now cleared almost all of its goodwill linked to decorative coatings. One could see this as a fresh start for Mr B\u00fcchner or the acceptance of reality by the company with regard to the current state of its paint markets.\"",
