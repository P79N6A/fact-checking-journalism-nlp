      "bodyText": "London\u2019s stock market brushed off electoral concerns to hit a new high as European shares also surged to a 15-year record on hopes that weaker currencies would support corporate profits. The FTSE 100 index of leading UK shares closed up 1.1% at 7,090 points and also hit a new intra-day high of 7,095. The index continued its run despite jitters about the result of next month\u2019s general election that made the pound touch a five-year low against the dollar. The FTSE 100 is up about 8% since the start of 2015 despite the growing likelihood of a second successive parliament with no party securing an overall majority. Britain\u2019s biggest companies make most of their profits overseas, meaning that sterling\u2019s fall against the dollar could boost export earnings. Rolls-Royce and Imperial Tobacco, which were hit by the strength of the pound last year, were both among the top risers. The biggest gainer in the FTSE 100 was the drugs company Shire, whose shares rose 5% after the US watchdog fast-tracked an eye disease treatment. Housebuilders also rose on news this week of further house price growth. Barratt Developments and Taylor Wimpey shares were both up more than 3%. The FTSEurofirst 300 index of top European shares closed 0.9% higher at 1,645 points, powering past its 2007 peak and taking gains so far this year to 20%. Traders bet that further declines in the already weak euro would support economic recovery and buoy company profits. Germany\u2019s DAX index hit a record and France\u2019s CAC 40 rose to its highest level since 2008. News this week that Greece had repaid a \u20ac450m (\u00a3325m) loan instalment to the IMF also lifted the market. European shares have risen this year as global investors increased their interest in the region on expectations that the euro\u2019s slide would give companies an export lift. About half of eurozone corporate earnings come from outside the region and the euro\u2019s 16% fall against a basket of currencies this year means profits earned overseas will be worth more when converted back into euros. The FTSE 100 broke through the record set during the peak of the dotcom boom in February. The record of 6,950 had stood since the final trading day of 1999. The index broke through the 7,000 barrier for the first time last month, although it is still below the 1999 peak once inflation is taken into account. Markets have been supported for months by central banks keeping interest rates low. The European Central Bank joined the UK and the US last month in pumping money into the financial system through quantitative easing, by acquiring sovereign debt from financial institutions which in turn reduced the value of the euro. US shares also rose on Friday, led by GE\u2019s announcement that it would offload most of its risky GE Capital business and buy back shares. The S&amp;P 500 index closed up 1.7% for the week \u2013 its second week of gains, supported by an increase in merger activity. Japan\u2019s Nikkei index rose above 20,000 points for the first time in 15 years.",

      "bodyText": "Growing City jitters about the prospect of a hung parliament and signs of weakness in the key manufacturing sector prompted sterling to hit a five-year low against the dollar in foreign exchange markets on Friday. Sterling fell to $1.4558 on Friday morning \u2013 the lowest level since the uncertain days that followed the 2010 general election. It later recovered some ground but still closed down 0.51% on the day at $1.4637. Against the euro, it was flat at \u20ac1.379. Investors are struggling to assess the tax and spending implications of a range of possible electoral outcomes, from a minority Labour government to another Conservative-led coalition. Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets, an online trading business, said: \u201cThe pound has started to come under some pressure in recent days as the prospect of political gridlock in a few weeks\u2019 time starts to become a real possibility, at a time when some of the economic data is starting to show some signs of weakness.\u201d Sarah Hewin, of Standard Chartered bank, said her research suggested sterling is unlikely to recover until a government has been formed. \u201cThe lesson appears to be that the pound rallies on an end to political uncertainty when a majority government is elected, while a hung parliament and intensification of uncertainty leads to a currency drop.\u201d Election concerns have not fed through to share prices, however. The FTSE 100, which reflects the fortunes of the global economy at least as much as the UK\u2019s, closed up 1.1% at a new record high of 7,089.77 points. As well as pre-election nerves, currency traders were unsettled by lower-than-expected industrial production in February, which some analysts said pointed to a slowdown in the UK economy. Industrial production rose just 0.1% in February due to a big fall in North Sea oil production. Economists had expected a rise of 0.3%. Howard Archer, chief economist at consultancy IHS Global Insight, said Britain\u2019s manufacturers can expect to benefit if the eurozone, their key market, improves in the coming months. \u201cOn the export front, manufacturers will be fervently hoping that the eurozone can build on recent signs of improving growth and this increasingly translates into increasing demand for UK manufactured goods.\u201d Separate figures showed that construction output also fell in February, by 0.9%, after a 2.5% decline in January, raising further doubts about the strength of economic recovery. Alan Clarke, head of European fixed-income strategy at Scotiabank, said the figures suggested economic growth may have weakened to 0.4% in the first quarter of the year from 0.6% quarter-on-quarter growth in the last three months of 2014. Clarke said: \u201cThis is not going to make pleasant reading for the coalition government in the final days of the election campaign.\u201d However, the National Institute for Economic and Social Research thinktank (Niesr) said its model pointed to a continuation of the 0.6% growth rate seen at the end of last year. \u201cThis suggests the economy has continued to expand at a reasonable pace, consistent with the average rate of growth since the start of 2013,\u201d Niesr said. Official figures for GDP growth in the first quarter of the year will be published on 28 April, at a key moment during an election campaign in which the Tories have sought to highlight the success of their \u201clong-term economic plan\u201d. With less than a month until election day on 7 May, there has been little to divide Labour and the Conservatives in the opinion polls. The last time an election was so tight was 1992, when Labour led for most of the campaign but the Conservatives scraped a majority. Against this backdrop, the cost of insuring against volatility in the pound\u2019s value against the dollar over the next month rose to its highest since September 2011 on Thursday. Figures from the Debt Management Office, the government body which sells UK sovereign debt, also showed foreign investors cutting their holdings of UK government bonds over concerns about an electoral stalemate and the stability of the pound. Hewson and colleagues at CMC said the pound and share prices could be hit by a prolonged stalemate if there was a second consecutive hung parliament. \u201cStock markets hate uncertainty, and the potential for an unstable government following a close race could impact the FTSE and the pound in the days and weeks following a close race until a workable solution is found, if indeed there is one.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The news that Majestic has not only taken over the online upstart Naked Wines but also nabbed its controversial founder, Rowan Gormley, as its new boss will come as quite a shock to fans of the retail chain. Majestic, however, has not been firing on all cyclinders. Inflated prices, meaning almost every wine is subject to a reduction, and a less diverse range make it a much less exciting place to shop than it was 10 years ago under its previous chief executive, Tim How. The apparent incompatibility of the two businesses is not so marked when you consider that Naked Wines also operates a business model of discounting from inflated margins. So-called \u201cangels\u201d who sign up to spend \u00a320 a month with the company get substantial reductions, but they\u2019re far from being the bargains bragged about on the site. Nor are all the wines as individual and handcrafted as might be assumed from Naked\u2019s claim that they are made by small, artisan winemakers. I\u2019ve tasted some pretty dreary examples in my time. The 140,000-plus angels, however - there is, believe it or not, a waiting list - obviously like the personal relationships they can build with winemakers, many of whom respond to their comments and turn up to events to meet them in person. Naked\u2019s crowdfunded model can certainly give winemakers starting their own ventures a welcome kickstart, or additional funding when things get tough. An example is UK-born Katie Jones, whom Gormley rescued when a wine tank was vandalised at her Languedoc winery Domaine Jones. Naked bought up the rest of her production, enabling her to stay afloat. Gormley\u2019s personal Twitter feed, @rowbags, suggests he may have had his eye on Majestic for some time. In November, when the company was rapped for asking its suppliers to help fund a new warehouse, he retweeted a Naked Wines tweet that read: \u201cTo all disgruntled @majesticwine suppliers, if you\u2019d rather we fund your capital expenditure rather than the other way around, get in touch\u201d. Whether the businesses will be kept separate, as both parties are insisting, or Majestic stores will be rebranded as Naked Wines remains to be seen. The most likely outcome is that some sites will be renamed, depending on the local demographic, which would allow Gormley to experiment with a more innovative retail model. The high street wine retailers, including the supermarkets, certainly have to do something to meet the challenge posed by Aldi and Lidl. Gormley\u2019s strength is undoubtedly thinking outside the box, such as entering into partnerships with other brands, including jamieoliver.com and The List magazine. Whatever he does at Majestic will be interesting, and will certainly shake up the wine trade.",

Inflated prices, meaning almost every wine is subject to a reduction, and a less diverse range make it a much less exciting place to shop than it was 10 years ago under its previous chief executive, Tim How.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/apr/10/naked-wines-founder-takes-charge-of-majestic-after-70m-deal\">Naked Wines founder takes charge of Majestic Wine after \u00a370m deal</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The apparent incompatibility of the two businesses is not so marked when you consider that Naked Wines also operates a business model of discounting from inflated margins. So-called \u201cangels\u201d who sign up to spend \u00a320 a month with the company get substantial reductions, but they\u2019re far from being the bargains bragged about on the site. </p> <p>Nor are all the wines as individual and handcrafted as might be assumed from Naked\u2019s claim that they are made by small, artisan winemakers. I\u2019ve tasted some pretty dreary examples in my time.</p> <p>The 140,000-plus angels, however - there is, believe it or not, <a href=\"http://www.nakedwines.com/angels\">a waiting list</a> - obviously like the personal relationships they can build with winemakers, many of whom respond to their comments and turn up to events to meet them in person.</p> <p>Naked\u2019s crowdfunded model can certainly give winemakers starting their own ventures a welcome kickstart, or additional funding when things get tough. An example is UK-born Katie Jones, <a href=\"http://www.leicestermercury.co.uk/Vandals-pour-60-000-worth-wine-drain/story-18914054-detail/story.html\">whom Gormley rescued when a wine tank was vandalised at her Languedoc winery Domaine Jones</a>. Naked bought up the rest of her production, enabling her to stay afloat. </p> <p>Gormley\u2019s personal Twitter feed, @rowbags, suggests he may have had his eye on Majestic for some time. In November, when the company was rapped for asking its suppliers to help fund a new warehouse, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/rowbags\">he retweeted a Naked Wines tweet</a> that read: \u201cTo all disgruntled @majesticwine suppliers, if you\u2019d rather we fund your capital expenditure rather than the other way around, get in touch\u201d.</p> <p>Whether the businesses will be kept separate, as both parties are insisting, or Majestic stores will be rebranded as Naked Wines remains to be seen. The most likely outcome is that some sites will be renamed, depending on the local demographic, which would allow Gormley to experiment with a more innovative retail model. The high street wine retailers, including the supermarkets, certainly have to do something to meet the challenge posed by Aldi and Lidl. </p> <p>Gormley\u2019s strength is undoubtedly thinking outside the box, such as entering into partnerships with other brands, including jamieoliver.com and <a href=\"https://www.list.co.uk/offer/1404-free-60-voucher-for-naked-wines/\">The List</a> magazine. Whatever he does at Majestic will be interesting, and will certainly shake up the wine trade.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Aviva has reduced the maximum payout for its chief executive under a long-term share plan following opposition to the potential \u00a33.4m award for this year. The insurer had proposed granting Mark Wilson shares worth up to 3.5 times his \u00a3980,000 salary. The award could have taken his total earnings for 2015 to \u00a36.7m. However,after an objection this week by the shareholder adviser, believed to be Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS), the maximum payment under the long-term incentive plan was cut to three times Wilson\u2019s salary, or \u00a32.9m. ISS also took issue with the maximum long-term incentive plan award for Aviva\u2019s finance director Tom Stoddard. The company cut his maximum payment to 2.25 times his \u00a3675,000 salary from 2.5 times. The change means the most he can earn from plan is \u00a31.52m. Patricia Cross, who chairs Aviva\u2019s remuneration committee, said: \u201cThe board was disappointed to receive feedback this week from a shareholder voting agency which expressed concern over the proposed [long-term incentive plan] awards, despite the tangible progress made by the management team and the award being within the company\u2019s remuneration policy.\u201d Cross said shareholders had generally supported Aviva\u2019s pay proposals before ISS\u2019s late intervention. The revised package is intended to head off any investor revolt at Aviva\u2019s AGM on 29 April. Executive pay is a touchy subject at Aviva after its former chief executive Andrew Moss was forced out during the shareholder spring of 2012. At an acrimonious AGM, 60% of shareholders withheld support from Moss\u2019s pay deal of up to \u00a35m, sealing his fate. Last month, Aviva announced better-than-expected annual operating profit up 6% to \u00a32.17bn as it prepared to take over Friends Life in a deal engineered by Wilson. Aviva\u2019s asset management arm was fined \u00a317.6m this year by the Financial Conduct Authority for systems failures in 2013. Executives at some of Britain\u2019s biggest companies are braced for battles over pay and other matters during this year\u2019s AGM season. WPP and BG Group are in investors\u2019 sights over pay along with the insurer Prudential. Aviva\u2019s rival paid its chief executive Tidjane Thiam \u00a311.8m in 2014. ISS is the biggest adviser to institutional investors on how to vote on pay and other governance matters. The US-based group demonstrated its clout last year when its objections helped force a climbdown at BG over the pay deal for new boss Helge Lund.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Finance ministers and central bankers from more than 100 countries will gather at the International Monetary Fund in Washington next week amid a diplomatic spat over China\u2019s plans for a rival financial institution. The IMF\u2019s regular get-togethers of policymakers, held jointly with the World Bank, have been a fixture on economists\u2019 calendars since the birth of the so-called Bretton Woods institutions after the second world war. But times are changing, and Britain\u2019s decision last month to join a new $100bn Chinese-led lender, the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, despite US opposition underlines the shifting balance of power in the global economy. The AIIB, like its European equivalent, the Luxembourg-based European Investment Bank, will focus on backing large-scale infrastructure projects such as dams, pipelines, road networks and power generation schemes that may have considerable economic benefits, but cannot easily secure full funding from domestic banks. The need appears to be great. The Asian Development Bank (ADB), the Japan-dominated lender already operating in the region, reckons $8tn worth of infrastructure is needed by 2020. British construction, engineering and consultancy firms are expected to compete for contracts. At the time, the British chancellor, George Osborne, described the UK\u2019s involvement in the AIIB as \u201can unrivalled opportunity for the UK and Asia to invest and grow together\u201d. The US, however, was irritated by the chancellor\u2019s enthusiasm, and issued a rare public rebuke to London. The US national security council spokesman Patrick Ventrell said Washington feared the AIIB would take a laxer approach to lending than the World Bank and ADB. \u201cWe believe any new multilateral institution should incorporate the high standards of the World Bank and the regional development banks,\u201d he said. \u201cBased on many discussions, we have concerns about whether the AIIB will meet these high standards, particularly related to governance and environmental and social safeguards.\u201d Washington\u2019s refusal to engage with the AIIB has begun to look increasingly futile. Thirty Asian countries have now signed up as founding members of the AIIB, and the UK has been joined by Germany, France and Italy. Alert to the shifting global landscape, Christine Lagarde, the IMF\u2019s managing director, said last month that she would be delighted to cooperate with the new lender once it was up and running. The World Bank president, Jim Yong Kim, described the AIIB, together with the Brics infrastructure bank set up by Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa \u2013another new institution of which the US has been wary \u2013 as \u201cpotentially strong allies in tackling the enormous challenge of bringing much needed infrastructure to Asia\u201d. Developing countries have battled hard to win their fair share of influence at the IMF and the World Bank, whose leadership is vetted by the Europeans and the Americans, and whose voting power is still dominated by the west. The IMF was originally envisaged as the guardian of the global financial system, but since fixed exchange rates were largely abandoned in the 1970s it has become more prominent as a lender to governments in crisis, including most recently in the eurozone. The World Bank was created to rebuild Europe\u2019s shattered infrastructure after the war, but now focuses on tackling global poverty. Japan\u2019s proposal for an \u201cAsian monetary fund\u201d at the height of the region\u2019s financial crisis in the late 1990s, when many countries felt ill-served by the IMF\u2019s aggressive approach, was stifled by US opposition to the idea. Since then, the US Congress has blocked even modest efforts to ensure the voice of developing countries is heard more clearly within the IMF. Hard-fought negotiations in 2010 resulted in a package of proposals that would cut the number of European seats on the IMF board, and increase representation for major developing countries. Under current arrangements, China\u2019s voting share is only marginally larger than Italy\u2019s, despite having an economy more than four times its size. There is a deep suspicion on Capitol Hill of multilateral institutions, particularly among Republican, and Congress has never adopted the 2010 reforms. Five years on, developing countries haven\u2019t given up fighting for change in Washington, but they are increasingly building up their own alternatives. The US reluctance to relinquish control of the Bretton Woods institutions may ultimately have led to the formation of a new family of lenders that will result in Washington ceding far more power. As David Marsh of the Official Monetary and Financial Institutions Forum (Omfif) put it in a recent briefing, \u201cThe US and China, the world\u2019s two main economic powers, have locked horns over establishing a major development bank that could rival the twin Bretton Woods institutions - and Beijing has emerged, for the first time, as the clear winner.\u201d The governance arrangements for the AIIB are still under discussion, but Britain argues that signing up as a founder member will mean its voice is heard when deciding what kind of loans to make. For the cash-strapped countries that turn to development lenders, whether it\u2019s in times of crisis or to fund a new bridge or runway, the arrival of the AIIB and other new bodies is likely to be a good thing, according to Duncan Green, a strategic adviser to Oxfam. \u201cWhat they\u2019re creating is a kind of pluralism, which should strengthen the hand of the governments looking for help,\u201d he said.",

Majestic has battled intense competition from discount supermarkets and been without a chief executive since February when Steve Lewis stepped down following a sharp fall in Christmas sales. Naked Wines, founded by Gormley in December 2008, runs a crowdfunded business involving around 300,000 subscribers who help fund more than 130 independent winemakers across 14 countries in exchange for access to exclusive wines at preferential prices. The new chief executive said he would steer away from price wars with discount grocers such as Lidl and Aldi. \u201cFor our customers, if they are given a choice between \u2018would you like to buy something that doesn\u2019t taste very nice and is kind of boring for \u00a33.99 down to \u00a32.99, or would you like a bottle of something absolutely stunning for seven quid?\u2019 they will go for the second one every time. I think if we are absolutely consistent about delivering that, the supermarkets can do whatever the hell they like and we will still have a great business,\u201d said Gormley. The two companies will continue to operate separately but the online experience of Naked Wines and its popularity in the US and Australia are expected to benefit Majestic, which has struggled to embrace online selling. The wine retailer also said it would withhold afinal dividend for 2015 and interim dividend for the next year. When Lewis stepped down in February after 29 years working at Majestic, the company said digital sales would be an area that the new chief executive would need to focus on. \u201c[Majestic] are behind the curve without a doubt [online] and direct marketing to their customers. Certainly, getting together with Naked, the skillset could help out Majestic get on the curve quicker and avoid wasting money,\u201d said Kate Calvert, an analyst with Investec. \u201cThey are still going to be run as separate businesses and the IT platform will be run separately but it is using the experience of Naked Wines, which has been very good at developing an online business.\u201d Majestic Wine will pay about \u00a350m in cash, to be funded through new debt, and \u00a320m in shares. Naked Wines generated sales of \u00a374m last year, up 40% on a year ago, but made a loss of \u00a33.3m. Majestic Wine trades from more than 200 outlets with 640,000 active customers. The firms said the combination would give Naked Wines access to a nationwide store network to allow a click-and-collect delivery option for its customers. Gormley said there were benefits for both companies. \u201cFrom Naked into Majestic, what these benefits have got in common is both companies have got to develop in areas where they are weak and benefit from the other one\u2019s knowledge of doing that,\u201d he said. \u201cSo from the Naked side\u2026 we got to the point where we were thinking that we would have to open some shops if we want to keep growing in the UK and slightly daunted by that prospect because it is an expensive business with a long learning curve. \u201cFrom Majestic\u2019s point of view, I think what Naked can bring is knowledge of the mobile and online world which can help to improve the customer experience,\u201d he said. Gormley will replace Nigel Alldritt, chief financial officer, who has been acting interim chief executive. He will now go back to his previous role. Majestic was forced into cutting prices at Christmas as customers were tempted away by competitors. \u201cThe kneejerk reaction to be competitive and do offers, which is not quite the Majestic way, was a reflection that we did not have a sufficient long-term robust strategy to give people confidence \u2013 by that I mean shareholders and staff and suppliers \u2013 to do what we do best which is brilliant service, great ranges, great innovation and delivering that consistently,\u201d said Majestic chairman Phil Wrigley.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Good-bye and have a good weekend. We\u2019ll be back on Monday. Disappointing industrial production and construction data have raised the prospect of slower economic growth in Britain, pushing the pound to five-year lows against the dollar. The currency is already under pressure amid concerns that the 7 May election will produce a hung parliament. The pound has lost more than a cent against the dollar to $1.4650, but is slightly down against the euro at \u20ac1.3791. The FTSE 100 index is on track for a new record closing high European shares have risen to their highest level since the millennium, helped by the weak euro which is benefiting exporters. The FTSEurofirst 300 index of top European shares is currently up 0.65% at 1640.14. French industrial output was flat in February while Spanish production rose 0.6% The FTSE 100 index of leading shares is trading nearly 40 points higher at 7053.63, a 0.55% gain. It is inching closer to an intra-day record high of 7065.o8 points reached in March. The FTSE is also on track to set a new all-time closing high, beating the 7,037.67 reached on 23 March. Last month the index finally broke through the 7,000 barrier \u2013 a level not seen since the dotcom boom of 1999. Drugmaker Shire is still the biggest riser, up 5.2%, after positive news on its dry-disease treatment Liftegrast. Housebuilders Barratt and Taylor Wimpey were lifted by upgrades by broker Jefferies. Meanwhile fellow pharmaceutical firm AstraZeneca is bucking the trend, with its shares down 2% at one stage, the top faller on the FTSE, after staff at the US top health regulator said its diabetes drug Onglyza appears to be associated with an increased rate of death. A clinical study in 2013 found that the drug might be linked to heart failure. Some more thoughts on the slide in the pound. With inflation expected to be zero or negative in Tuesday\u2019s data, and analysts expecting a prolonged undershoot of the 2% inflation target, a fall in sterling should be welcome from an inflation perspective. It should also help exports, ease the pressure on Britain\u2019s current account deficit and help rebalance the economy. Some election pundits argue, however, that the fall in sterling is a bad thing, reflecting loss of faith in the UK. It\u2019s also bad for holidaymakers, obviously. Also on the corporate front, General Electric confirmed it plans to sell the bulk of its $30bn property portfolio over the next couple of years, as it returns to its industrial roots. GE shares jumped 7% in premarket trading after the company also unveiled a big share buyback plan. GE is selling most of its property assets to private equity giant Blackstone and US bank Wells Fargo in a $23bn deal. It hopes to offload an additional $4bn of commercial real estate to unidentifed buyers. On stock markets, the FTSE 100 index is about 24 points higher at 7039.44, a 0.3% rise. Germany\u2019s Dax has climbed nearly 1.6% to 12,357.37 while France\u2019s CAC is 0.4% ahead at 5232. Drugmaker Shire has been leading shares higher in London all day, jumping more than 5% to \u00a325.06, near all-time highs. The stock has been boosted by news that one of its drugs \u2013 Liftegrast for dry eye disease \u2013 would be fast-tracked by US regulators. The medicine has been granted a priority review to speed up the target time to market to eight months, rather than 12. The pound has fallen even lower, hitting $1.4603 at one stage. Looking ahead to next week, the European Central Bank will hold its first meeting on Thursday since its bond-purchase programme started. Nick Kounis, head of macro and financial markets research, says: President Draghi\u2019s big challenge in the press conference will be to sound positive about the impact of QE and the outlook for the economy without sounding like it is going \u2018too well\u2019. He is likely to make it clear that the central bank plans to continue asset purchases to at least September 2016 and we think he is likely to successfully dismiss talk of tapering or exit. This task will become much more challenging later in the year, and certainly in 2016, as the economy continues to gain momentum. The first-quarter GDP figures are out on 28 April, a week before the general election. Victoria Clarke, economist at Investec, has crunched today\u2019s numbers. The sogginess of construction sector output remains an ongoing puzzle. It has clearly been at odds with the PMI survey data. Furthermore, there is no one weak sector with the ONS numbers pointing to relatively broad based weakness... Hence we are left scratching our heads as to whether this is reflective of the true output of the sector. Even so, clearly it is these numbers which provide the construction sector\u2019s contribution to first quarter output; even if construction output rebounds by 2\u00bd% in March, we would still be looking at a 2.5% decline over Q1 altogether, following on from the hefty 2.2% Q4 drop. The \u2018official\u2019 story for the UK industrial sector is similarly disappointing news for the prospects for first quarter output. Indeed, allowing for a \u00bd% rise in industrial output in March, we would still only see output of the sector standing around flat over Q1 overall. Note however that this is not due to weakness across the industrial sector overall but is led by a 3.8% m/m drop in oil and gas output. Indeed, the ONS points to the reduction in oil and gas output at some North Sea terminals compared to a year ago, with the contribution of crude/petroleum and natural gas to the February industrial sector figures at some -0.37ppts (i.e. sizeable drag). The picture for the UK\u2019s manufacturing sector was a better one, with output meeting consensus expectations and recording growth of +0.4% month to month (Investec forecast +0.6%). With the UK manufacturing PMI having firmed into March, this leaves us optimistic that, oil and gas aside, the prospects for the UK\u2019s manufacturing sector are far from grim. What this all means, we suspect, is that whilst a softer Q1 GDP print than Q4\u2019s +0.6% looks to be firmly on the cards now, short of some very heavy lifting from the UK\u2019s dominant services sector in February and March, this isn\u2019t necessarily a story of a UK recovery coming off the tracks. Indeed, the underlying position of UK manufacturers looks respectable and survey data on the strength of UK services output suggests the sector\u2019s prospects have firmed as we have headed through the quarter. For Mr Cameron however this may be of little comfort, with the first quarter UK GDP figures due just over a week before the general election; with a key strand of the Conservative\u2019s policy case built on their economic performance the 28 April figures could prove to be important. Here\u2019s a chart showing the pound\u2019s movements against the dollar over the last five years. More reaction to today\u2019s UK factory and industrial output data from the British Chambers of Commerce. David Kern, the lobby group\u2019s chief economist, says: February figures showed a modest improvement after last month\u2019s declines but underlying industrial growth remains weak and so manufacturers will continue to face serious challenges. However, in the face of these difficult conditions our manufacturing sector has coped well with the rise in the pound against the euro over the past year and the sector has largely succeeded in maintaining its skills base during the recession. It is a credit to their strength and resilience. While UK growth is likely to remain dependent on the healthy and dynamic services sector for the foreseeable future, there is no room for despondency. The manufacturing sector is in a good position to move forward when world circumstances improve, but only if low interest rates are maintained. Ahead of the tightly fought UK general election on 7 May, Colin Cieszynski and Michael Hewson from CMC Markets look at how a hung parliament result could affect the markets. The race to win the election looks like it could go right to the wire with both the Conservative and Labour party neck and neck in the polls, convincing just 35% of the electorate each. Stock markets hate uncertainty, and the potential for an unstable government following a close race could impact the FTSE and the pound in the days and weeks following a close race until a workable solution is found, if indeed there is one. A scenario where one of Labour or the Conservatives wins the popular vote and one wins the most seats could add to the potential mess and uncertainty. To get an idea of what a hung parliament could mean for the FTSE and the pound, the market strategists have taken a look at several previous close elections from around the world which ended up creating more questions than they answered. Stock Market Performance following selected elections with contested results For each of the elections in this century daily returns for the main local stock market index around the election date were analysed while for the two from the 1970s daily data was unavailable so monthly numbers around the election were used to approximate instead. Regardless, the results speak for themselves. Elections from five different countries that ended in a muddle were followed by immediate selloffs that only deepened as it became clear that there was no easy or quick resolution to the problems. In all six cases, the local market was down a month later, and in half of them, the local market was down more than 10%. The analysts conclude: This suggests that should the UK election end in an indecisive result and wrangling over a coalition government drags, the FTSE and sterling could become increasingly vulnerable through May. In Britain\u2019s construction industry, activity slowed across all areas with the exception of new projects in the public housing sector, according to the ONS, which indicated that housing associations were among the few organisations to expand their output in February. The broader measure of ongoing activity showed that all parts of the construction industry declined, including public housebuilding , private housebuilding, civil engineering and infrastructure work. More encouragingly, factory output improved, but mainly in the car industry, which recently reported its best production output this century. Nevertheless, factory output in the first quarter is so far running 0.2% below the fourth quarter of last year. The BBC\u2019s economics editor Robert Peston writes: So the US Treasury has noticed there is a general election happening in Britain. This is what a report sent yesterday to Congress said about us: \u201cThe potential for difficult coalition talks, and subsequently the design and implementation of economic policy, is broadly perceived as a material downside risk for businesses and investors.\u201d Or as I mentioned earlier this week, sterling will continue to take the strain (the pound will fall) if investors become more concerned that weak and directionless government will be the consequence of the poll on 7 May. Broadly, however, the US Treasury paints a positive picture of trends in the British economy - except for the widening to a record level in the current account deficit, the huge imbalance between the money we make from the rest of the world and what we pay the rest of the world (which I\u2019ve been banging on about for many months). Chris Williamson, chief economist at economic survey compiler Markit, concurs. Weaker than expected construction sector and industrial production numbers point to the economy having slowed at the start of the year. The data provide further evidence to support the case of interest rates to remain on hold, and will add to chatter that policy may even need to be loosened further. However, more up-to-date survey data suggest the economy is showing signs of reviving again, which suggests that the next move in interest rates will be a rise, but that there\u2019s little likelihood of rates being hiked this year. Alan Clarke, head of European fixed income strategy at Scotiabank, says GDP growth in the first quarter, between January and March, is looking weak after the disappointing industrial and construction data. This morning\u2019s UK data were disappointing again, with construction and industrial production both weaker than expected. January saw all 3 components of GDP by output shrinking. So we were looking for a rebound in February to get things back on track for a respectable Q1 GDP\u2026 \u2026but we didn\u2019t get the rebound There has been no growth in industrial production so far in Q1 and construction has shrunk by 3.5%. Unless we get big revisions to these data, or a massive jump in services output in February and March, then GDP growth of just 0.4% q/q (down from 0.6% q/q in Q4) is looking like the most likely outcome. Yesterday\u2019s weak trade data would seem to back this up from the expenditure side too. This is not going to make pleasant reading for the coalition government in the final days of the election campaign. The pound has fallen to a five-year low of $1.4623. Against the euro, sterling is flat at \u20ac1.3805. Britain\u2019s construction industry fared even worse, with output down 0.9% in February, wrongfooting City economists who had pencilled in 2% growth. In January, output slid 2.5%. The pound is heading towards a five-year low of $1.4635 after disappointing industrial production data, which do not bode well for overall economic growth. A sharp fall in oil and gas output in February is to blame for the small (0.1%) rise in industrial output. The ONS said the 12% annual decline in oil and gas production in February was the biggest fall since August 2013. However, markets are taking a dim view of the data. Sterling has dipped to $1.4669 from around $1.4685 before the figures were released. Here is some instant reaction to the UK data. David Richardson, head of manufacturing at Lloyds Bank Commercial Banking, says: After an unsure start, it looks like manufacturers are getting back on track and helping to push industrial production back into positive growth. On the ground we see that boardroom confidence and the appetite to invest is high and it appears that this is now translating into healthy pipelines of activity. Management teams must stay this course and focus on expansion if they are to capitalise on the longer term growth prospects that the economy will no doubt present. In the 3 months to February, industrial production and manufacturing were 10.4% and 4.9% respectively below their figures reached in the pre-downturn GDP peak in the first quarter of 2008, the ONS says. UK industrial output is weaker than expected: it edged up 0.1% in February, vs expectations of a 0.4% gain, while manufacturing met City forecasts with a 0.4% rise. Industrial production is the wider measure, which comprises manufacturing, mining and utilities. You can find out more on the data on the Office for National Statistics\u2019 website here. \u201cOne more turn of the financial screw and Greece would be in capital controls; a terrible symptom of political failure of a six-year attempt to restore sustainability,\u201d writes Gabriel Sterne, economist at Oxford Economics. Conditional on capital controls, we suggest probabilities for (1) a quick exit; (2) a slow exit; (3) recovery, drawing on lessons from Cyprus. \u20ac-exit would be our baseline, but is not inevitable. A detailed comparison with Cyprus establishes why the Greek case would likely be far more severe. Politics is key. In Cyprus, a new centre-right government implemented painful capital controls in the face of remarkably weak political opposition, and was able to pass on a big chunk of recapitalisation costs to foreign depositors. There was strong domestic support for deep fiscal and structural reforms. Within months the programme came to be seen as a credible path towards banking solvency, liquidity and fiscal sustainability; controls were removed after two years. We stress three possible scenarios: (1) Political breakthrough and path towards euro re-integration (30% probability). In spite of the gloomy narrative, a long path back to normality is only a change in political direction away. Capital controls could, if deposit freezes are avoided, trigger political change, programme adherence, and eventual normalisation. (2) Period of extended brinksmanship and crisis, which ultimately ends in exit (30% probability). Brinksmanship gives way to euro-rationing, and probably default. A parallel currency could emerge, which could last a while in spite of being very inefficient in allocating scarce euros. There is a referendum, which, if pro-euro, could prolong euro afterlife, but ultimately too much damage would be done and exit would follow. (3) Negotiated exit from the euro, probably announced within a month (40% probability). The Eurozone runs out of patience and an exit deal is negotiated. The deal involves staying in the EU. Capital controls are a symptom of a deeper political malaise \u2013 the same one that has failed to restore Greek debt sustainability though prolonged crisis. The solution, like the blame, lies on both sides. Since 2009, the Troika have never offered Greece an adjustment path that is sustainable given the political context. Syriza or not, there is little support in Greece for the necessary adjustment to push debt towards sustainability. The next couple of months represent last chance saloon. Capital controls in themselves would impose a considerable deadweight cost on Greece, making debt metrics much worse and agreement even more difficult. And they would impact on public opinion. On the one hand desperation to keep the euro could push Greeks to accept more austerity; and the immediacy of massive default costs may push Eurozone politicians towards a last ditch agreement. On the other hand, it is feasible that mutual frustration is based on such fundamentally misaligned incentives that capital controls turn out to be a point of no return. Athens faces another key week next week, when the Greek government will need to roll over \u20ac2.4bn worth of 3 and 6 month T-bills in bond auctions, as well as paying out over \u20ac1.5bn of social security payments. The ECB once again raised its Emergency liquidity assistance (ELA) facility yesterday by \u20ac1.2bn to just over \u20ac73bn, as capital continues to leak out of Greek banks. Kuenzel at Daiwa believes Athens needs to \u201cstart dancing to the Eurogroup\u2019s tune\u201d. The group of eurozone finance ministers meets in Riga, Latvia, on 24 April. So, by 24 April, when the Eurogroup meets in Riga, the Greek reform plans need to be better specified, realistically costed and purged of counterproductive labour market and pension measures. Certainly, euro area finance ministers are probably at the end of their tether after ten weeks of the new government\u2019s foot-dragging and game-playing, and any sympathy for the Greek position has long disappeared. And notwithstanding Tsipras\u2019 comments in Moscow that the EU had more to lose than Greece if the rescue failed, it is clear that the Greek government\u2019s bargaining position is exceedingly weak. Unlocking the existing bailout funds is Greece\u2019s only option to avoid default and euro exit and the Eurogroup has been resolute in its message on what is required of Greece. So if the country is to receive further bailout money to save it from default in May, the Tsipras administration is going to have to start dancing to the Eurogroup\u2019s tune. For those who thought it was going to be a \u201cGreece-free day\u201d (it is Good Friday in Greece today): according to the Times, eurozone countries are secretly drawing up plans to kick Greece out of the currency bloc as they prepare for the country to be declared bankrupt next month. The story cites a memo drawn up by the finance ministry in Finland, which is closely allied to Germany. Greece has until next Friday to come up with a new list of economic reforms that must then be agreed by its three international creditors \u2013 the European Central Bank, European Union and International Monetary Fund \u2013 to unlock \u20ac7.2bn of aid. Robert Kuenzel, director of euro area economic research at Daiwa Capital Markets, says: After Greece\u2019s repayment of \u20ac460m to the IMF yesterday and the ECB\u2019s decision to grant a further \u20ac1.2bn in Emergency Liquidity Assistance to Greek banks, the flow of crisis-related news is likely to die down during the Orthodox Easter weekend beginning today and running until Tuesday. But with only five working days remaining for the Greek administration to substantively improve on its reform offerings to the Eurogroup, the Greek government faces the Herculean task of developing - and legislating - a reform programme sufficient to unlock the remaining \u20ac7.2bn of bailout funds before the Eurogroup meets on 24 April. Back to the pound. Analysts are warning that sterling could slide further ahead of the 7 May general election in the UK \u2013 the closest for more than 20 years. It\u2019s fallen to $1.4681 this morning. Hewson at online trader CMC Markets says: The pound has started to come under some pressure in recent days as the prospect of political gridlock in a few weeks\u2019 time starts to become a real possibility, at a time when some of the economic data is starting to show some signs of weakness. In London, the FTSE 100 index has gained more than 30 points to 7047.70, a 0.5% rise. The Dax in Frankfurt is nearly 70 points ahead at 12235.11, a 0.6% gain, while the CAC in Paris has risen over 12 points, or 0.2%, to 5221.58. European shares are rising again, as fears over Greece have eased somewhat following yesterday\u2019s \u20ac450m debt repayment to the IMF. The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 share index has powered ahead to hit is highest level since 2000, while the euro continued its slide, dropping to its lowest level since 19 March. The weak euro is good news for exporters. The FTSEurofirst 300 index of top European shares is up 0.4% at 1637.19. Spain fared better, with a 0.6% rise in industrial production in February. Manufacturing in France was also unchanged in February, missing estimates of a 0.6% gain, after January\u2019s revised decline of 0.3%. Industrial output in France was flat in February. Contrast this with Greece, where production unexpectedly jumped by 1.9%. European stock markets are expected to finish the week on a high, with the weak euro boosting exporters. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. After another crunch day for Greece yesterday \u2013 Athens had to (and did) repay a \u20ac450m loan tranche to the International Monetary Fund \u2013 the focus is on the rest of Europe today, with industrial production data out for France, Spain and the UK. In the UK, manufacturing output is expected to bounced back in February from the previous month\u2019s weak reading. Philip Shaw, chief economist at Investec, is predicting a 0.6% gain following January\u2019s 0.5% drop. He has pencilled in a slightly smaller rise of 0.4% for industrial production which also includes mining and utilities, following January\u2019s 0.1% decline. This reflects uncertainty around oil output, which he assumes was flat on the month. The figures are out at 9.30am BST, along with construction output. The pound has fallen to $1.4694 this morning. Any disappointment in the numbers is likely to put further pressure on sterling. Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets, says the pound\u2019s weakness in recent days suggests the potential for a return to the March lows of $1.4630, and possibly even lower, as we head towards the election next month, with the 2010 lows at $1.4230 now in play. To stabilise we need to move beyond the $1.5000 area, which has capped every rally for the last week.",

Victoria Clarke, economist at Investec, has crunched today\u2019s numbers.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p><strong>The sogginess of construction sector output remains an ongoing puzzle.</strong> It has clearly been at odds with the PMI survey data. Furthermore, there is no one weak sector with the ONS numbers pointing to relatively broad based weakness... Hence we are left scratching our heads as to whether this is reflective of the true output of the sector. Even so, clearly it is these numbers which provide the construction sector\u2019s contribution to first quarter output; even if construction output rebounds by 2\u00bd% in March, we would still be looking at a 2.5% decline over Q1 altogether, following on from the hefty 2.2% Q4 drop.</p> <p><strong>The \u2018official\u2019 story for the UK industrial sector is similarly disappointing news for the prospects for first quarter output.</strong> Indeed, allowing for a \u00bd% rise in industrial output in March, we would still only see output of the sector standing around flat over Q1 overall. Note however that this is not due to weakness across the industrial sector overall but is led by a 3.8% m/m drop in oil and gas output. Indeed, the ONS points to the reduction in oil and gas output at some North Sea terminals compared to a year ago, with the contribution of crude/petroleum and natural gas to the February industrial sector figures at some -0.37ppts (i.e. sizeable drag). The picture for the UK\u2019s manufacturing sector was a better one, with output meeting consensus expectations and recording growth of +0.4% month to month (Investec forecast +0.6%). <strong>With the UK manufacturing PMI having firmed into March, this leaves us optimistic that, oil and gas aside, the prospects for the UK\u2019s manufacturing sector are far from grim.</strong></p> <p>What this all means, we suspect, is that whilst a softer Q1 GDP print than Q4\u2019s +0.6% looks to be firmly on the cards now, short of some very heavy lifting from the UK\u2019s dominant services sector in February and March, <strong>this isn\u2019t necessarily a story of a UK recovery coming off the tracks.</strong> Indeed, the underlying position of UK manufacturers looks respectable and survey data on the strength of UK services output suggests the sector\u2019s prospects have firmed as we have headed through the quarter. </p> <p><strong>For Mr Cameron however this may be of little comfort, with the first quarter UK GDP figures due just over a week before the general election; with a key strand of the Conservative\u2019s policy case built on their economic performance the 28 April figures could prove to be important.</strong></p> </blockquote> <p><strong><br></strong></p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5527a5a5e4b0eb74a285d785\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2015-04-10T10:28:19.921Z\">11.28am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Here\u2019s a chart showing the pound\u2019s movements against the dollar over the last five years.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7a5555bd78ebef8d25f18d3129ca0a0ce10674d4\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/4/10/1428661668374/7ba334ce-bc37-4d40-97c0-211d885181a0-460x184.png\" alt=\"Sterling vs dollar 2010-2015\" width=\"460\" height=\"184\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sterling vs dollar 2010-2015</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Thomson Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-55279c7be4b04e9a7cbb7751\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2015-04-10T09:50:20.456Z\">10.50am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>More reaction to today\u2019s UK factory and industrial output data from the British Chambers of Commerce.

In Cyprus, a new centre-right government implemented painful capital controls in the face of remarkably weak political opposition, and was able to pass on a big chunk of recapitalisation costs to foreign depositors. There was strong domestic support for deep fiscal and structural reforms. Within months the programme came to be seen as a credible path towards banking solvency, liquidity and fiscal sustainability; controls were removed after two years.</p> <p>We stress three possible scenarios:</p> <p>(1) Political breakthrough and path towards euro re-integration (30% probability). In spite of the gloomy narrative, a long path back to normality is only a change in political direction away. Capital controls could, if deposit freezes are avoided, trigger political change, programme adherence, and eventual normalisation.</p> <p>(2) Period of extended brinksmanship and crisis, which ultimately ends in exit (30% probability). Brinksmanship gives way to euro-rationing, and probably default. A parallel currency could emerge, which could last a while in spite of being very inefficient in allocating scarce euros. There is a referendum, which, if pro-euro, could prolong euro afterlife, but ultimately too much damage would be done and exit would follow.</p> <p>(3) Negotiated exit from the euro, probably announced within a month (40% probability). The Eurozone runs out of patience and an exit deal is negotiated. The deal involves staying in the EU.</p> <p>Capital controls are a symptom of a deeper political malaise \u2013 the same one that has failed to restore Greek debt sustainability though prolonged crisis. The solution, like the blame, lies on both sides. Since 2009, the Troika have never offered Greece an adjustment path that is sustainable given the political context. Syriza or not, there is little support in Greece for the necessary adjustment to push debt towards sustainability.</p> <p>The next couple of months represent last chance saloon. Capital controls in themselves would impose a considerable deadweight cost on Greece, making debt metrics much worse and agreement even more difficult.</p> <p>And they would impact on public opinion. On the one hand desperation to keep the euro could push Greeks to accept more austerity; and the immediacy of massive default costs may push Eurozone politicians towards a last ditch agreement. On the other hand, it is feasible that mutual frustration is based on such fundamentally misaligned incentives that capital controls turn out to be a point of no return.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-552786abe4b04e9a7cbb7727\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2015-04-10T08:19:42.820Z\">9.19am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Athens faces another key week next week, when the Greek government will need to roll over \u20ac2.4bn worth of 3 and 6 month T-bills in bond auctions, as well as paying out over \u20ac1.5bn of social security payments. </strong></p> <p>The ECB once again raised its<strong> </strong>Emergency liquidity assistance (ELA)<strong> </strong>facility yesterday by \u20ac1.2bn to just over \u20ac73bn, as capital continues to leak out of Greek banks.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-552784d2e4b0aef4615dc5ca\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2015-04-10T08:12:02.276Z\">9.12am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Kuenzel at Daiwa believes Athens needs to \u201cstart dancing to the Eurogroup\u2019s tune\u201d.

      "bodyText": "Anyone puzzled by the sudden jump in Twitter\u2019s share price this week could have usefully checked out stock market news site briefing.com. The social network had hired Goldman Sachs, the investment bankers, the site claimed, to defend itself against being snapped up by Google. The trouble was this was at least the third time the two have been linked. The same rumour had surfaced as recently as January and dates back to at least February 2011, before the micro-blogging site went public. The company declined to comment on the claims either time; neither responded to a request for comment this time. Nevertheless, if a deal were to happen, it would be the second-biggest ever acquisition in technology, well ahead of Facebook\u2019s $19bn (\u00a313bn) purchase of WhatsApp in 2013 and behind only the $106bn AOL-Time Warner merger of January 2000. Twitter is valued at about $33bn. Google has around $60bn in the bank, though a lot of that is stashed overseas to avoid taxes on repatriation; a share- or debt-funded acquisition might be simpler. But why would Google be interested in Twitter? The short answer is that Twitter, whose users send out 140-character \u201ctweets\u201d visible to anyone who follows them, has something the search and data specialist does not: a thriving, engaged social network. Despite multiple attempts by Google down the years to build something similar, it can only look on in envy at Twitter\u2019s 300 million users logging on every month, sending over 500m tweets every day on the topics that interest huge swathes of the world. Eric Schmidt, Google\u2019s chairman (and chief executive through its fast-growth years), told Bloomberg in December that \u201cthe biggest mistake that I made was not anticipating the rise of the social networking phenomenon\u201d. He added: \u201cIt\u2019s not a mistake we\u2019re going to make again. In our defence, we were working on many other things, but we should have been in that area, and I take responsibility for that.\u201d Some think Google\u2019s problem with \u201csocial\u201d is that its data-driven culture tends to be blind to the tweaks that make people love social networks. But as mobile use becomes dominant, social networks offer the most valuable advertising space. In the fourth quarter of 2014, 69% of Facebook\u2019s advertising revenue came from mobile ads, up from 53% a year before; and revenues were up 49%. Google, by contrast, has seen its cost-per-click (what advertisers pay when someone clicks on an ad) decline by 30% over the past four years as mobile use has grown, limiting its potential for revenue growth. Google, of course, relies on advertising for 90% of its revenues, and perhaps more of its income. Ben Thompson, an independent technology analyst who writes the Stratechery blog, said the contrast with Facebook shows Google \u201cis behind both on mobile \u2026 and potentially in brand advertising, which works best in a \u2018stream\u2019. Twitter is a route back to both.\u201d It\u2019s not that Google hasn\u2019t tried. The search company has targeted \u201csocial\u201d at least four times since January 2004, when it launched the first, a Facebook-like social network called Orkut. That became hugely popular in a number of countries, including Brazil and India. But Facebook outpaced it, and was focused where Google wasn\u2019t; Orkut finally closed down in September 2014. It tried with Jaiku, a Twitter-like service acquired in October 2007, which it effectively abandoned in 2009 and shut in January 2012. It then tried again with Buzz, started in February 2010, creating a \u201csocial network\u201d based on your email recipient database. That was calamitous: complaints that it violated its own privacy promises led to quick action by the US\u2019s Federal Trade Commission, which in March 2011 bound Google over for 20 years to \u201cregular, independent privacy audits\u201d. Buzz was shut down in October 2012 \u2013 though the privacy audits remain in force. Most recently Google+, launched in June 2011, tried to add more precision to Facebook\u2019s simple idea of \u201cfriends\u201d by letting you create \u201ccircles\u201d \u2013 such as family, friends, colleagues and special interest groups \u2013 with whom you could share different content. Yet despite being bolted on by default to every Google Mail account \u2013 and so rapidly rising to hundreds of millions of users \u2013 Google+ has never gained traction. Facebook was already too big, and people found it too taxing sorting their contacts into different circles, and then having to decide what was appropriate for each of them to see when sharing content. Its biggest success has been as a photo repository because of the automatic upload from Android phones; keen photographers love it. While Google+ has not been widely popular, it has been effective at doing what Google wants \u2013 gathering information about peoples\u2019 web activity and visits (because once you had logged in, it could follow your online movements). It has now been uncoupled from Google Mail, but its purpose remains. Vacuuming up all that data about peoples\u2019 online habits would only get easier through Twitter. In an interview with the Guardian in 2009, Marissa Mayer \u2013 then still at Google as head of search \u2013 enthused about \u201creal-time search\u201d, which is what Twitter in effect offers. For example, she said: \u201cYou can ask: \u2018Is this conference today any good? Is it warmer in San Francisco than it is in Silicon Valley?\u2019 You can actually look at tweets and see those sorts of patterns, so there\u2019s a lot of useful information about real time and your actions that we think will ultimately reinvent search.\u201d Technology analyst Jan Dawson, who runs Jackdaw Research in Utah, said: \u201cIf Google could provide integration between Google and Twitter accounts, it could suddenly do ad targeting a lot better than Twitter is currently able to do, which could boost both sides of the business.\u201d But, he points out, \u201cto really get the benefits of integration, Google would need to connect Google and Twitter IDs, and the last time Google undertook a big ID integration effort it got hammered by regulators across Europe\u201d. (Google is threatened with fines by privacy regulators in Europe over its integration in January 2012 of separate user IDs from search, YouTube and other Google properties.) Dawson said: \u201cGoogle\u2019s problem in social is less a cultural handicap and more just that it\u2019s really tough because success relies on quickly gaining critical mass which generates positive network effects. It\u2019s hard for anybody, as confirmed by the fact that only two social networks have really taken off on a global scale, and one is utterly dominant. Buying the smaller of the two major global social networks is arguably the most feasible way to get into the business at this point, so it makes sense for that reason.\u201d However, Thompson thinks the acquisition is \u201cvery unlikely, primarily because I\u2019m not sure it makes sense at the price Twitter would command. \u201cThat aside,\u201d he adds, \u201cI do think it would be great for both companies.\u201d Dawson agrees: \u201cI could see Twitter\u2019s management resisting it because they finally have their strategy in place and are starting to execute on it. If I were them, I think I\u2019d rather follow through on that than see someone new take over.\u201d What Google could bring to Twitter: 1) huge number of advertisers already using Google AdWords and AdSense 2) global reach 3) potential inclusion by default in Android mobile software 4) integration with YouTube for short and long video 5) resilient systems What Twitter could bring to Google: 1) highly engaged social network 2) users\u2019 instant \u201csentiment data\u201d 3) different dimension to \u201csearch\u201d 4) mobile-optimised platform for advertising 5) positive reputation on privacy",

      "bodyText": "A sharp fall in North Sea oil production in February hit the UK\u2019s industrial production output and drove down the pound on foreign exchange markets. Sterling fell to a five-year low against the dollar as analysts predicted a sharp slowdown in the British economy in the first quarter to 0.4%. While the manufacturing sector made steady progress in the second month of the year, a decline in North Sea oil and gas combined with a fall in mining and quarrying to limit industrial production to a 0.1% rise. Separate figures from the Office for National Statistics for the construction industry, which showed declines in infrastructure and private house building, added to concerns that a tepid recovery in Britain\u2019s productive industries has made the economy reliant on consumer-driven services and rising levels of household debt. Alan Clarke, UK economist at Scotia Bank, said the weak state of the economy would prove embarrassing for the coalition going into the election. \u201cUnless we get big revisions to these data, or a massive jump in services output in February and March, then GDP growth of just 0.4% quarter on quarter is looking like the most likely outcome. \u201cThis is not going to make pleasant reading for the coalition government in the final days of the election campaign,\u201d he said. Clarke warned that a 0.9% month on month fall in construction, which followed a 2.5% dive in the previous month, would be a drag on first quarter growth. He added that the lacklustre 0.1% rise in industrial production after shrinking by 0.1% in January would add to the UK\u2019s woes. \u201cIn other words, there has been no growth in IP so far in Q1 and construction has shrunk by 3.5%,\u201d he said.
