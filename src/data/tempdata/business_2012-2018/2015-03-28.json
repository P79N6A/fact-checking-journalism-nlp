      "bodyText": "The Abbott government has elected to begin the process of joining the China-led Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank \u2013 but is still telegraphing concerns about the structure of the organisation. China launched the $100bn proposal last year and more than 20 countries have announced their intention to be founding members. There have been different views within the cabinet about whether Australia should join the institution. The United States has been distinctly cool on the proposal which, given its resources and membership, could ultimately rival other global financial institutions, like the World Bank. When Britain joined the AIIB in mid March, the White House issued a rare public rebuke, declaring its hope and expectation that the UK would use its influence to ensure that high standards of governance are upheld. The US sees the AIIB as a vehicle for China to exert influence in the region. The spectrum of cabinet views have prompted Australia to appear first supportive, then cool, then, over the past fortnight, supportive once again. Last week the prime minister Tony Abbott told reporters he was in discussions with the United States and with Japan about Australia joining the AIIB. The statement issued by the prime minister, Tony Abbott, the foreign minister, Julie Bishop, and the treasurer, Joe Hockey, early on Sunday, was still hedged. Australia would sign a memorandum of understanding on the AIIB \u201cwhich would allow Australia to participate as a prospective founding member in negotiations to set up the bank.\u201d \u201cThe government has discussed the AIIB extensively with China and other key partners inside and outside the region,\u201d the joint statement said. \u201cGood progress has been made on the bank\u2019s design, governance and transparency over the past few months, but we still have issues that we will address through ongoing consultations,\u201d it said. \u201cKey matters to be resolved before Australia considers joining the AIIB include the bank\u2019s board of directors having authority over key investment decisions, and that no one country control the bank.\u201d",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Aldi and Lidl have done it in the grocery market; B&amp;M has done it in homewares; now former Asda boss Andy Bond is preparing to unleash the discounter model on clothes retailing. Pep &amp; Co is to open its first store, in Kettering, Northamptonshire, in July and expects to have 50 up and running by the end of August, selling mainstream clothes designed to appeal to young mums \u2013 setting it apart from the more youth fashion-orientated Primark. It will also stock childrenswear and a smattering of homewares. Having pioneered a similar idea nearly a decade ago with Asda\u2019s George brand, Bond insists there is room in the UK clothing market for a new player. He has brought in former Sainsbury\u2019s and Matalan executive Adrian Mountford as managing director and in the long term sees scope for 500 stores. Bond, once one of the highest flyers in the Walmart empire and tipped as the next Marks &amp; Spencer boss, sees his new chain in the role of plucky underdog, and is putting in his own cash. But there is also serious financial muscle involved, with \u00a320m backing from Pepkor, the South African group that owns 3,700 clothes stores worldwide, including nearly 3,000 in southern Africa, a 500-store chain in Poland, called Pepco, and growing businesses in the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Romania, Hungary, Australia and New Zealand. Pepkor\u2019s chairman is South African billionaire Christoffel Wiese, who once led a string of British discount chains including Poundstretcher and What Everyone Wants, under the Brown &amp; Jackson group. Pepkor was recently bought by Steinhoff International Holdings, another South African-based retailer and manufacturer, which owns Harveys, Bensons for Beds and Cargo in the UK, and Conforama in France. Bond, a sports enthusiast who has helped build up online cycling retailer Wiggle since abruptly walking out of Asda four years ago, believes the death of the high street has been announced prematurely, and that shoppers will shop locally if the price is right. \u201cWe\u2019re going in where others have retreated. I think a lot of people want to go to a local shopping centre on a regular basis and buy a full range of things their family need,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s disappointing that for a whole lot of reasons that choice has diminished, and it would have diminished further if it wasn\u2019t for the likes of B&amp;M and Poundland.\u201d Pep &amp; Co\u2019s clothing will appeal to the shoppers who are already buying in such stores and in places like Wilko and Iceland. Where shops such as BHS, Dorothy Perkins, Peacocks and mid-sized regional chains have moved away from smaller high streets and towns, Pep &amp; Co wants to move in, aiming to emulate the grocery discounters in offering simplicity and low prices. \u201cI think we are a disrupter but not in the same way,\u201d Bond says. \u2018There\u2019s no big four in clothing. But what the discounters have done in food I hope we can do in fashion \u2013 hold a mirror up to the industry and ask what real value means.\u201d An engineer by background before joining Asda after completing an MBA, Bond correctly read the mood in retailing when he declared, in the depths of 2008-9 recession, that we were entering a longer age of austerity, when \u201cfrugal would be cool\u201d. But why should Pep &amp; Co succeed where the likes of MK One, Peacocks and BHS have stumbled \u2013 and where even Bond\u2019s own attempt to take George on to the high street failed after a four-year trial run? The new chain will be battling in a tough market, where shoppers still have little cash to spare. And it will be up against one of the savviest operators on the high street \u2013 Primark \u2013 which has the benefits of scale and a well-known brand to help it. Bond insists that being a relative tiddler with just 50 stores won\u2019t be a disadvantage. \u201cThere are suppliers who are just as willing to work with someone with 50 stores as someone with more than 300 because they can talk directly to the decision-makers,\u201d he says. \u201cBig businesses are rife with bureaucracy, and often hindered by red tape. Big can mean slow and costly.\u201d He says the stores will appeal to those who are largely reliant on public transport and who want to be able to shop close to home for convenience and for financial reasons. \u201cPeople increasingly value their time. If you can deliver value on the high street, they will increasingly prefer you.\u201d And Bond points out that, unlike the grocery market, where Aldi and Lidl are competing for customers with the \u201cbig four\u201d supermarkets, which together control about 75% of sales, the market for clothing is much more fragmented. \u201cPrimark is a brilliant business, but it controls less than 10% of the UK clothing market,\u201d he says. \u201cLots of retailers manage to survive and thrive even though Primark is a wonderful company.\u201d He points out, also, that Primark does not even trade in many of the small towns and secondary high streets which Pep &amp; Co is planning to inhabit. Instead, the new chain\u2019s rivals will be nearby supermarkets and smaller local outfits. \u201cIf this is successful, women will come in to shop firstly for their children and secondly for themselves,\u201d says Bond. \u201cThe heartbeat of the business will be kidswear. The womenswear will be extremely mainstream, not fashion. It will be more like George, Sainsbury\u2019s Tu, than Primark.\u201d From his four years running Asda\u2019s George division and his five years as overall boss of the supermarket, Bond knows that market well. And Pepco, thanks to its financial might, has managed to grow rapidly in eastern Europe in the past decade, from just 14 stores within Poland to nearly 600 across the region. Bond is hoping to repeat that trick in the UK: \u201cIf we do a great job, then in 10 years\u2019 time we like to think that we could be the B&amp;M of clothing.\u201d",

And it will be up against one of the savviest operators on the high street \u2013 Primark \u2013 which has the benefits of scale and a well-known brand to help it.</p> <p>Bond insists that being a relative tiddler with just 50 stores won\u2019t be a disadvantage. \u201cThere are suppliers who are just as willing to work with someone with 50 stores as someone with more than 300 because they can talk directly to the decision-makers,\u201d he says. \u201cBig businesses are rife with bureaucracy, and often hindered by red tape. Big can mean slow and costly.\u201d</p> <p>He says the stores will appeal to those who are largely reliant on public transport and who want to be able to shop close to home for convenience and for financial reasons.</p> <p>\u201cPeople increasingly value their time. If you can deliver value on the high street, they will increasingly prefer you.\u201d</p> <p>And Bond points out that, unlike the grocery market, where Aldi and Lidl are competing for customers with the \u201cbig four\u201d supermarkets, which together control about 75% of sales, the market for clothing is much more fragmented.</p> <p>\u201cPrimark is a brilliant business, but it controls less than 10% of the UK clothing market,\u201d he says. \u201cLots of retailers manage to survive and thrive even though Primark is a wonderful company.\u201d</p> <p>He points out, also, that Primark does not even trade in many of the small towns and secondary high streets which Pep &amp; Co is planning to inhabit. Instead, the new chain\u2019s rivals will be nearby supermarkets and smaller local outfits.</p> <p>\u201cIf this is successful, women will come in to shop firstly for their children and secondly for themselves,\u201d says Bond. \u201cThe heartbeat of the business will be kidswear. The womenswear will be extremely mainstream, not fashion. It will be more like George, Sainsbury\u2019s Tu, than Primark.\u201d</p> <p>From his four years running Asda\u2019s George division and his five years as overall boss of the supermarket, Bond knows that market well.</p> <p>And Pepco, thanks to its financial might, has managed to grow rapidly in eastern Europe in the past decade, from just 14 stores within Poland to nearly 600 across the region. Bond is hoping to repeat that trick in the UK: \u201cIf we do a great job, then in 10 years\u2019 time we like to think that we could be the B&amp;M of clothing.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "Greek ministers are spending this weekend, almost five grinding years since Athens was first bailed out, wrangling over the details of the spending cuts and economic reforms they have drawn up to appease their creditors. As the recriminations fly between Europe\u2019s capitals, campaigners are warning that the global community has failed to learn the lessons of the Greek debt crisis \u2013 or even of Argentina\u2019s default in 2001, the consequences of which are still being contested furiously in courts on both sides of the Atlantic. As Janet Yellen\u2019s Federal Reserve prepares to raise interest rates, boosting the value of the dollar, while the plunging price of crude puts intense pressure on the finances of oil-exporting countries, there are growing fears of a new debt crisis in the making. Ann Pettifor of Prime Economics, who foreshadowed the credit crunch in her 2003 book The Coming First World Debt Crisis, says: \u201cWe\u2019re going to have another financial crisis. Brazil\u2019s already in great trouble with the strength of the dollar; I dread to think what\u2019s happening in South Africa; then there\u2019s Malaysia. We\u2019re back to where we were, and that for me is really frightening.\u201d Since the aftershocks of the global financial crisis of 2008 died away, the world\u2019s policymakers have spent countless hours rewriting the banking rulebook and rethinking monetary policy. But next to nothing has been done about the question of what to do about countries that can\u2019t repay their debts, or how to stop them getting into trouble in the first place. Developing countries are using the UN to demand a change in the way sovereign defaults are dealt with. Led by Bolivian ambassador to the UN Sacha Sergio Llorenti, they are calling for a bankruptcy process akin to the Chapter 11 procedure for companies to be applied to governments. Unctad, the UN\u2019s Geneva-based trade and investment arm, has been working for several years to draw up a \u201croadmap\u201d for sovereign debt resolution. It recommends a series of principles, including a moratorium on repayments while a solution is negotiated; the imposition of currency controls to prevent capital fleeing the troubled country; and continued lending by the IMF to prevent the kind of existential financial threat that roils world markets and causes severe economic hardship. If a new set of rules could be established, Unctad believes, \u201cthey should help prevent financial meltdown in countries facing difficulties servicing their external obligations, which often results in a loss of market confidence, currency collapse and drastic interest rates hikes, inflicting serious damage on public and private balance sheets and leading to large losses in output and employment and a sharp increase in poverty\u201d. It calls for a once-and-for-all write-off, instead of the piecemeal Greek-style approach involving harsh terms and conditions that knock the economy off course and can ultimately make the debt even harder to repay. The threat of a genuine default of this kind could also help to constrain reckless lending by the private sector in the first place. However, when these proposals were put to the UN general assembly last September, a number of developed countries, including the UK and the US, voted against it, claiming the UN was the wrong forum to discuss the proposal, which is anathema to powerful financial institutions. Pettifor shares some of the UK and US\u2019s scepticism. \u201cThe problem for me is that the UN has no leverage here,\u201d she says. \u201cIt can make these moralistic pronouncements but ultimately it\u2019s the IMF and the governments that make the decisions.\u201d Nevertheless, Llorenti has been touring the world\u2019s capitals making the case for change, and hopes to bring the issue back for fresh discussions next month. And while the debate rages, developing countries have been taking advantage of rock-bottom interest rates and the cheap money created by quantitative easing to stack up billions in new debt. Using recently released World Bank data, the Jubilee Debt Campaign calculates that in 2013 alone \u2013 the latest period for which figures are available \u2013 borrowing by developing countries was up 40% to $17.3bn. Brazil\u2019s economy is likely to be seriously tested as the greenback rises; Turkey, Malaysia and Chile have large dollar-denominated debts and sliding currencies; and a string of African countries face sharp rises in debt repayments. Ghana and Zambia have already had to turn to the IMF to ask for help. It\u2019s as if, as Pettifor warns, \u201cabsolutely nothing has changed since the crisis\u201d.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "A union jack cushion is plumped up on the white leather sofa, a white teapot is on the desk and there is a view to St Paul\u2019s cathedral. The office belongs to Portuguese banker Ant\u00f3nio Horta-Os\u00f3rio, and his mission, he says, is \u201cto help Britain prosper\u201d. Known to his staff as Horta or AHO, the 51-year-old has been at the helm of Lloyds Banking Group \u2013 bailed out with \u00a320bn of taxpayer cash in 2008 and still one-fifth publicly owned \u2013 for the last four years. He now considers the UK \u2013 where he is member of Queen\u2019s tennis club and chair of the Wallace Collection (the appointment letter signed by David Cameron is on display in the office) \u2013 as a home from home. \u201cI think the British people with their self-deprecating style \u2013 being humble and wanting to do better \u2013 do not see how good they are,\u201d he says. Our other outstanding qualities, he says, are tolerance and a sense of fairness. He is no doubt hoping that these characteristics will mean a ruckus can be avoided over his \u00a311.5m pay packet - which has to be approved at the bank\u2019s annual meeting on 14 May, just a week after the general election. He clearly reckons he is worth the money: \u201cI hope that people will judge pay for performance,\u201d he says. While some bosses shirk from defending their personal pay deals, Horta-Os\u00f3rio \u2013 whose 10-strong management team cashed in on \u00a323m through the same bonus scheme \u2013 does not. The bank\u2019s stock-market value has increased by \u00a330bn over the period, he says. Since his 1.3m bonus shares were awarded, the share price has climbed higher, from 34.7p to 79p, increasing the value of the payout still further. The turnaround story on AHO\u2019s watch \u2013 even though it is not complete \u2013 also includes the return of dividend payouts to shareholders for the first time since the crisis. It is a performance in stark contrast to that of bailed-out rival Royal Bank of Scotland, where the government has yet to sell any of its 79% stake. As of this week, taxpayers own just 22% of Lloyds \u2013 down from 43% at the time of the bailout. But it might not have worked out this way. Horta-Os\u00f3rio was written off by some in November 2011 when, just six months after taking over, he was forced to take two months off to recuperate from fatigue. It was a very public setback for a man who is so driven that when he broke his right wrist aged 30 he taught himself to write and play tennis with his left hand rather than ease up temporarily on work or play. While a student, he re-sat his tax exams so he could improve his already high score. For pleasure, he scuba dives with sharks. What drives him? He reckons it was his Jesuit education: \u201cThat had an influence. Jesuits are a great school in terms of being humble, austere, dedicated, hard-working. I think life is a marathon and resilience is one of the most important features, \u201d he says. Except that by the end of 2011, Horta-Os\u00f3rio\u2019s tough approach had deserted him. He was exhausted, but unable to rest. After five days without sleep, he checked himself into the Priory clinic to recover from \u201cfatigue\u201d: and the experience, he says, \u201chas made me much more resilient\u201d. Looking back to that experience, he is reluctant to speak about the problem or the cure, but likens running a bank on the brink to captaining a sinking ship. Both, he explains, need their leader in charge at all times: \u201cIf you have a boat letting in water in the middle of a storm, you had better be at the wheel. If you fix your boat and you are in blue skies and no waves, you can go to sleep and leave somebody else at the wheel.\u201d He has since rationalised his working life: he has fewer people reporting to him, chairs fewer internal committees, no longer convenes meetings on Sundays and tries not to look at emails after 8pm. When he took the helm, he recalls, the bank was in a dire position. It had \u00a3300bn of debt, half of which was on very short repayment schedules. It was in the middle of the eurozone crisis, and the bank was over-extended in 30 countries. Now he has retrenched: Lloyds operates only in six countries and 95% of the business is in the UK: focused, as he puts it, on families and small businesses. The debt position has also stabilised. His well-rehearsed patter about his record does not mention the toll on jobs. Some 30,000 staff were already lined up for the axe following the rescue of HBOS at the height of the 2008 banking crisis. Horta-Os\u00f3rio took out another 15,000 under his first three-year plan. His latest plan involves another 9,000 job losses, along with 50 branches a year. \u201cUnfortunately, we had to lower the number of people,\u201d he says, in something of an understatement, adding that he used redeployment and natural turnover as much as possible. His latest three-year plan \u2013 outlined in October \u2013 involves cutting another 200 branches as more of Lloyds\u2019s banking services move online. The banker, who learned his trade at Goldman Sachs and spent time in Portugal, Spain, the US and Brazil before arriving in the UK 10 years ago \u2013 says that if he had been running Lloyds in 2008 he would never have taken over the near-bust HBOS. At the time, he was running Santander\u2019s UK arm, and he did take over struggling rivals during the crisis, including Bradford &amp; Bingley, but only the branches and clients: he left their toxic mortgage books for the government to nationalise. Earlier this month, Spanish bank Sabadell agreed a \u00a31.7bn takeover of TSB, the bank created from 631 branches that were carved out of Lloyds under the terms imposed by the EU at the time of the bailout. The Portuguese banker \u2013 who points out it cost \u00a31bn more to perform the separation, in line with EU orders, than the new bank is now worth \u2013 always thought TSB, with its 4.6% share of current accounts and, unusually, more deposits than loans, would attract an offer. He also hopes it will be a strong bank \u2013 if only to appease the politicians. Labour has talked about creating two new banks on the high street to boost competition. Moreover, the Competition and Markets Authority has already embarked on an 18-month investigation into the sector, which could ultimately be bad news for Lloyds because the bank still has a 25% share of current accounts even after the TSB disposal. Horta-Os\u00f3rio, however, insists he is more concerned about improving competition in the small business market than in personal banking. With the reputation of the banking industry continuing to take a battering \u2013 most recently HSBC has been back in the headlines after the Guardian and other publications published details of its Swiss arm helping customers avoid tax \u2013 Horta-Os\u00f3rio believes there will always be mistakes: \u201cI say to my people \u2026 the only person who does not miss a penalty is the one who never plays football. Even Ronaldo and Messi miss penalties: fortunately, they miss one out of 10 or 100. It is human to err: to be human is to make mistakes.\u201d Lloyds has paid some huge fines and penalties for its huge, past mistakes. It was fined \u00a328m for using a bonus scheme that put staff under so much pressure to meet targets that they sold products to themselves. There was also a \u00a3226m fine for rigging Libor and a \u00a34.3m punishment for being slow to make payouts for mis-sold payment protection insurance. But, Horta-Os\u00f3rio says, he is instilling a new culture, one where people must try to do the right thing. It was he who kicked off the huge PPI compensation movement, which has now totalled more than \u00a320bn across the banking business. After a legal battle that pre-dated Horta-Os\u00f3rio\u2019s arrival, the Lloyds boss unexpectedly gave up the fight in March 2011 and set aside more than \u00a33bn to cover the expected bill. But the impact was far bigger than that. The bill at Lloyds has now mushroomed to \u00a312bn, but Horta-Os\u00f3rio insists he has no regrets in terms of the cost to shareholders: \u201cIt was about doing the right thing.\u201d There have been rumblings that AHO might be ready to move on once the government stake is gone. Osborne, in his last budget of this government, outlined plans to sell another \u00a39bn shares \u2013 which would take the taxpayers\u2019 stake down to 7% next year if the Tories form the next government. And Horta-Os\u00f3rio expects Labour to follow a similar policy of selling down the stake. But for now, his mind is on his new business proposal: \u201cI am just starting the new three-year plan. It\u2019s a new plan: it\u2019s a new job.\u201d",

The office belongs to Portuguese banker Ant\u00f3nio Horta-Os\u00f3rio, and his mission, he says, is \u201cto help Britain prosper\u201d.</p> <p>Known to his staff as Horta or AHO, the 51-year-old has been at the helm of Lloyds Banking Group \u2013 bailed out with \u00a320bn of taxpayer cash in 2008 and still one-fifth publicly owned \u2013 for the last four years.</p> <p>He now considers the UK \u2013 where he is member of Queen\u2019s tennis club and chair of the Wallace Collection (the appointment letter signed by David Cameron is on display in the office) \u2013 as a home from home.</p> <p>\u201cI think the British people with their self-deprecating style \u2013 being humble and wanting to do better \u2013 do not see how good they are,\u201d he says. Our other outstanding qualities, he says, are tolerance and a sense of fairness.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote\"> <blockquote> <p>If you have a boat letting in water in the middle of a storm, you had better be at the wheel</p> <footer> <cite>Ant\u00f3nio Horta-Os\u00f3rio</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>He is no doubt hoping that these characteristics will mean a ruckus can be avoided<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/feb/27/lloyds-pays-antonio-horta-osorio-11m-resumes-dividend-after-six-years\" title=\"\"> over his \u00a311.5m pay packet</a> - which has to be approved at the bank\u2019s annual meeting on 14 May, just a week after the general election. He clearly reckons he is worth the money: \u201cI hope that people will judge pay for performance,\u201d he says.</p> <p>While some bosses shirk from defending their personal pay deals, Horta-Os\u00f3rio \u2013 whose 10-strong management team cashed in on \u00a323m through the same bonus scheme \u2013 does not.</p> <p>The bank\u2019s stock-market value has increased by \u00a330bn over the period, he says. Since his 1.3m bonus shares were awarded, the share price has climbed higher, from 34.7p to 79p, increasing the value of the payout still further.</p> <p>The turnaround story on AHO\u2019s watch \u2013 even though it is not complete \u2013 also includes the return of dividend payouts to shareholders for the first time since the crisis. It is a performance in stark contrast to that of bailed-out rival Royal Bank of Scotland, where the government has yet to sell any of its 79% stake. As of this week, taxpayers own just 22% of Lloyds \u2013 down from 43% at the time of the bailout.</p> <p>But it might not have worked out this way. Horta-Os\u00f3rio was written off by some in November 2011 when, just six months after taking over, he was forced to take two months off to recuperate from fatigue.</p> <p>It was a very public setback for a man who is so driven that when he broke his right wrist aged 30 he taught himself to write and play tennis with his left hand rather than ease up temporarily on work or play. While a student, he re-sat his tax exams so he could improve his already high score. For pleasure, he scuba dives with sharks.</p> <p>What drives him? He reckons it was his Jesuit education: \u201cThat had an influence. Jesuits are a great school in terms of being humble, austere, dedicated, hard-working. I think life is a marathon and resilience is one of the most important features, \u201d he says.</p> <p>Except that by the end of 2011, Horta-Os\u00f3rio\u2019s tough approach had deserted him. He was exhausted, but unable to rest. After <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2011/dec/15/lloyds-chief-horta-osorio-sleeping-problems\" title=\"\">five days without sleep, </a> he checked himself into the Priory clinic to recover from \u201cfatigue\u201d: and the experience, he says, \u201chas made me much more&#xa0;resilient\u201d.</p> <p>Looking back to that experience, he is reluctant to speak about the problem or the cure, but likens running a bank on the brink to captaining a sinking ship. Both, he explains, need their leader in charge at all times: \u201cIf you have a boat letting in water in the middle of a storm, you had better be at the wheel. If you fix your boat and you are in blue skies and no waves, you can go to sleep and leave somebody else at the wheel.\u201d</p> <p>He has since rationalised his working life: he has fewer people reporting to him, chairs fewer internal committees, no longer convenes meetings on Sundays and tries not to look at emails after 8pm.</p> <p>When he took the helm, he recalls, the bank was in a dire position. It had \u00a3300bn of debt, half of which was on very short repayment schedules. It was in the middle of the eurozone crisis, and the bank was over-extended in 30 countries.</p> <p>Now he has retrenched: Lloyds operates only in six countries and 95% of the business is in the UK: focused, as he puts it, on families and small businesses. The debt position has also stabilised.</p> <p>His well-rehearsed patter about his record does not mention the toll on jobs. Some 30,000 staff were already lined up for the axe following the rescue of HBOS at the height of the 2008 banking crisis. Horta-Os\u00f3rio took out another 15,000 under his first three-year plan. His latest plan involves another 9,000 job losses, along with 50 branches a year. \u201cUnfortunately, we had to lower the number of people,\u201d he says, in something of an understatement, adding that he used redeployment and natural turnover as much as possible.</p> <p>His latest three-year plan \u2013 outlined in October \u2013 involves cutting another 200 branches as more of Lloyds\u2019s banking services move online.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c8a5aa04d265e32e0652705e109d42b0dbc22271\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/3/27/1427490682252/eae3e338-4d62-4bfc-a1aa-5dd3506ed2bd-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Branch of TSB bank\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">TSB, spun out of Lloyds on the instructions of the EU, is to be sold to Spanish bank Sabadell.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tim Ireland/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The banker, who learned his trade at Goldman Sachs and spent time in Portugal, Spain, the US and Brazil before arriving in the UK 10 years ago \u2013 says that if he had been running Lloyds in 2008 he would never have taken over the near-bust HBOS. At the time, he was running Santander\u2019s UK arm, and he did take over struggling rivals during the crisis, including Bradford &amp; Bingley, but only the branches and clients: he left their toxic mortgage books for the government to nationalise.</p> <p>Earlier this month, Spanish bank Sabadell agreed a \u00a31.7bn takeover of TSB, the bank created from 631 branches that were carved out of Lloyds under the terms imposed by the EU at the time of the bailout. The Portuguese banker \u2013 who points out it cost \u00a31bn more to perform the separation, in line with EU orders, than the new bank is now worth \u2013 always thought TSB, with its 4.6% share of current accounts and, unusually, more deposits than loans, would attract an offer.</p> <p>He also hopes it will be a strong bank \u2013 if only to appease the politicians. Labour has talked about creating two new banks on the high street to boost competition. Moreover, the Competition and Markets Authority has already embarked on an 18-month investigation into the sector, which could ultimately be bad news for Lloyds because the bank still has a 25% share of current accounts even after the TSB disposal.</p> <p>Horta-Os\u00f3rio, however, insists he is more concerned about improving competition in the small business market than in personal banking.</p> <p>With the reputation of the banking industry continuing to take a battering \u2013 most recently HSBC has been back in the headlines after the <em>Guardian</em> and other publications published details of its Swiss arm helping customers avoid tax \u2013 Horta-Os\u00f3rio believes there will always be mistakes: \u201cI say to my people \u2026 the only person who does not miss a penalty is the one who never plays football. Even Ronaldo and Messi miss penalties: fortunately, they miss one out of 10 or 100. It is human to err: to be human is to make mistakes.\u201d</p> <p>Lloyds has paid some huge fines and penalties for its huge, past mistakes. It was fined <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/dec/11/lloyds-banking-group-fined-misselling-scandal\" title=\"\">\u00a328m for using a bonus scheme</a> that put staff under so much pressure to meet targets that they sold products to themselves. There was<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/jul/28/lloyds-suspends-seven-people-rigging-rates-libor\" title=\"\"> also a \u00a3226m fine for rigging Libor</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/2013/feb/19/payment-protection-insurance-insurance\" title=\"\">a \u00a34.3m punishment for being slow to make payouts for mis-sold payment protection insurance</a>. But, Horta-Os\u00f3rio says, he is instilling a new culture, one where people must try to do the right thing.</p> <p>It was he who kicked off the huge PPI compensation movement, which has now totalled more than \u00a320bn across the banking business. After a legal battle that pre-dated Horta-Os\u00f3rio\u2019s arrival, the Lloyds boss unexpectedly gave up the fight <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2011/may/05/lloyds-loss-payment-protection-costs\" title=\"\">in March 2011</a> and set aside more than \u00a33bn to cover the expected bill. But the impact was far bigger than that. The bill at Lloyds has now mushroomed to \u00a312bn, but Horta-Os\u00f3rio insists he has no regrets in terms of the cost to shareholders: \u201cIt was about doing the right thing.\u201d</p> <p>There have been rumblings that AHO might be ready to move on once the government stake is gone. Osborne, in his last budget of this government, outlined plans to sell another \u00a39bn shares \u2013 which would take the taxpayers\u2019 stake down to 7% next year if the Tories form the next government. And Horta-Os\u00f3rio expects Labour to follow a similar policy of selling down the stake.</p> <p>But for now, his mind is on his new business proposal: \u201cI am just starting the new three-year plan. It\u2019s a new plan: it\u2019s a new job.\u201d</p>",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Greece submitted a long-awaited list of structural reforms to its creditors on Friday as its leftist-led government warned it would stop meeting debt obligations if negotiations failed and aid was not forthcoming. As officials from the EU, the European Central Bank (ECB) and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) prepared to pore over Athens\u2019s latest proposals, the country\u2019s international economic affairs minister, Euclid Tsakalotos, raised the stakes, saying while Greece wanted an agreement it was prepared to go its own way \u201cin the event of a bad scenario\u201d. He told the Guardian: \u201cWe are working in the spirit of compromise, we want a solution, but if things don\u2019t go well you have to bear the bad scenario in mind as well. That is the nature of negotiations.\u201d The government, dominated by the anti-austerity Syriza party, had assembled a package of 18 reforms in the hope of unlocking \u00a37.2bn in financial assistance. The desire was for a positive outcome, Tsakalotos said, but Athens\u2019s new administration was not willing to abandon its anti-austerity philosophy. Two months after assuming office, the government\u2019s priority remained to alleviate the plight of those worst affected by Greece\u2019s catastrophic five-year-long crisis. The British-trained economist said: \u201cOur top priority remains payment of salaries and pensions. If they demand a 30% cut in pensions, for example, they do not want a compromise.\u201d The reform-for-cash deal, the latest twist in Greece\u2019s battle to keep bankruptcy at bay, did not \u2013 and would not \u2013 include any recessionary measures, a government official said, adding it was hoped the proposals would bolster state coffers with \u20ac3bn (\u00a32.2bn) in badly needed revenues. \u201cThe actions proposed though the reforms list foresee revenues of \u20ac3bn for 2015, which under no circumstances will come from wage or pension cuts,\u201d he said. \u201cThe list does not include recessionary measures.\u201d Lenders have insisted that recessionary measures are unavoidable if the economy of Europe\u2019s most indebted state is to be put on a sustainable path. The 18 proposals \u2013 three times as many as put forward and dismissed by prime minister Alexis Tsipras\u2019s government last month \u2013 foresaw GDP growth of 1.4% this year. The package also endorsed finance minister Yanis Varoufakis\u2019s argument that the primary surplus demanded of Greece would have to be reduced. As such, the primary surplus was estimated to hit 1.5% in 2015 \u2013 half that in the country\u2019s existing bailout programme. With the country shut out of international capital markets, economists and officials have warned Athens could run out of money by 9 April, when it must pay \u20ac450m to the IMF. \u201cThe government is not going to continue servicing public debt with its own funds if lenders do not immediately proceed with the disbursement of funds which have been put on hold since 2014,\u201d said government aides. \u201cThe country has not taken receipt of an aid instalment from the EU or IMF since August 2014 even though it has habitually fulfilled its obligations.\u201d Following a precipitous decline in tax revenues, the Tsipras administration has been scrambling to raise funds, sequestering the cash reserves of state entities, raiding pension funds and postponing payments for supplies. As negotiations between Athens and lender organisations enter a particularly fractious phase, Varoufakis responded to speculation of his imminent sacking from the government as \u201camusing\u201d. \u201cEvery time the negotiations heat up, some new rumour of my resignation, demise, etc. springs up. Somewhat amusing \u2026\u201d he tweeted. A government insider said the flamboyant finance minister\u2019s enforced departure from office would be tantamount to \u201ca self-inflicted wound\u201d. \u201cIf he goes, it will be only when things have calmed down,\u201d he said. A euro working group is expected to respond to the Greek reform proposals on Monday.",

      "bodyText": "A union has accused the security contractor Serco of heavy-handed tactics in workplace negotiations, and has warned that any future industrial dispute would have a \u201cdisastrous effect\u201d on detention centres. Serco contractors who are part of the United Voice union were due to begin protected industrial action on Friday after six months of negotiations on workplace conditions failed to yield results. They were planning to hold bans on changes of rosters, including the scrapping of 15-minute handover meetings at the change of shifts, alterations to rostered days off, and abolishing new fitness tests during annual training courses. \u201cThe bans really said that we want the status quo to remain while negotiations are ongoing,\u201d the national president of United Voice, Jo Schofield, told Guardian Australia. \u201cStaff also need good systems of information flow in the centres so they can provide a safe environment for detainees. They also need consistent management practices. That\u2019s not happening,\u201d she said. Serco responded to news of the ban by threatening to stop paying staff members who took part in the action. \u201cIf an employee advises that they intend to participate in a work ban, we will comply with the Fair Work Act and provide adequate notice of our response. This can include notice that no payment will be made during a partial work ban,\u201d a Serco spokesman, Paul Shaw, told Guardian Australia. Schofield said the union then withdrew the bans after concerns it could lock out staff and start a major industrial dispute. \u201c[Serco\u2019s actions] could have provoked an industrial dispute \u2026 It was a sign of disrespect to union workers who voted to take protected industrial action,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s a bit of a sign of employer militancy.\u201d Schofield warned that any industrial dispute \u201cwould have had a disastrous effect on detention centres and detainees\u201d who, she said, were being used as pawns. Negotiations are continuing; a meeting between Serco and the union is planned for next week. In January Serco secured a five-year contract worth up to $1.4bn to run Australia\u2019s mainland detention centres, as well as the centre on Christmas Island. Shaw said operations would not be affected by any potential industrial action. \u201cIn the event of industrial action, we have sound contingency plans in place to ensure continuity of service to the people in our care,\u201d he said. A spokeswoman for the immigration minister, Peter Dutton, said the disputes over workplace conditions were a matter for the company and the unions to work out. The office of the opposition spokesman on immigration, Richard Marles, did not reply to Guardian Australia\u2019s requests for comment. The union said that working conditions in detention centres were increasingly volatile. \u201cThere are huge differences between being an officer in a detention centre and being a prison officer. People who are incarcerated because they broke the law know why are there and they know how long their imprisonment will last. They have opportunities to rehabilitate. It is not like that in a detention centre,\u201d Schofield said. \u201cDetainees are often very uncertain about how long they will be there and they have limited access to support.

We have a range of measures in place to support them, including a 24-hour employee assistance program. We are committed to continuous improvement and have a robust record of enhancing safety in our workplaces, year on year,\u201d he said. Earlier this month detention centre staff quelled a week-long disturbance within the Villawood detention centre. Dutton said at the time that the industrial dispute between detention centre staff and Serco had no impact on the disturbance.",
