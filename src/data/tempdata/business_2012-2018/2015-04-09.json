      "bodyText": "Poundland may have to sell up to 80 stores to win approval from the competition watchdog for its \u00a355m takeover of 99p Stores. The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) said on Thursday that an initial investigation into the planned merger of the two low-price chains had found that it would lead to \u201ca realistic prospect of a substantial lessening of competition\u201d in 80 areas where the two chains overlap. Sheldon Mills, senior director of mergers at the CMA, said: \u201cWithout competition from 99p Stores, there is the possibility that Poundland may have the incentive and ability to deteriorate its offer in these areas to the disadvantage of customers that have come to rely on their offer.\u201d The CMA added that the two chains\u2019 store opening plans showed there were a further 12 areas where Poundland and 99p Stores would be competitors in the near future. The watchdog said it would launch an in-depth investigation into the takeover unless Poundland put forward suitable undertakings to tackle the competition issues by 16 April. Analysts said the most likely remedy was the closure of stores in the 80 areas where there were concerns about competition and an undertaking to not open outlets in the further 12 locations. \u201cGiven how few retailers are opening space, this could cost the company in lease assignments/break fees and it shrinks the size of the deal by one-third,\u201d said Charlie Muir-Sands, an analyst at Deutsche Bank. Poundland said it was \u201ccarefully considering the CMA\u2019s announcement, together with the full detail behind it and will make a further announcement in due course\u201d. The company is due to issue a trading update on Tuesday and analysts are hoping it will provide more news on its plans regarding 99p Stores. The retailer could challenge the CMA\u2019s finding that its merger with 99p Stores would lessen competition because they both serve customers looking for \u201cconvenience and value at low and consistent prices\u201d. It could argue that many other stores, such as supermarket chains, sell the homewares, gardening equipment, stationery and groceries that the merging chains stock. But the recently listed business may not want to become embroiled in an uncertain six-month investigation process that would gather evidence from across the industry. The CMA said the merger would mean Poundland, which has about 600 outlets, faced only one other single-price retail competitor on a national scale \u2013 Poundworld. However, the competition watchdog acknowledged that the retailer also had competition from discount chains B&amp;M, Home Bargains and Poundstretcher.",

      "body": "<p>Poundland may have to sell up to 80 stores to win approval from the competition watchdog for its \u00a355m takeover of 99p Stores.</p> <p>The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) said on Thursday that an initial investigation into <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/feb/06/poundand-buys-rival-99p-stores\" draggable=\"true\">the planned merger of the two low-price chains</a> had found that it would lead to \u201ca realistic prospect of a substantial lessening of competition\u201d in 80 areas where the two chains overlap. </p> <p>Sheldon Mills, senior director of mergers at the CMA, said: \u201cWithout competition from 99p Stores, there is the possibility that Poundland may have the incentive and ability to deteriorate its offer in these areas to the disadvantage of customers that have come to rely on their offer.\u201d</p> <p>The CMA added that the two chains\u2019 store opening plans showed there were a further 12 areas where Poundland and 99p Stores would be competitors in the near future.</p> <p>The watchdog said it would launch an in-depth investigation into the takeover unless Poundland put forward suitable undertakings to tackle the competition issues by 16 April. </p> <p>Analysts said the most likely remedy was the closure of stores in the 80 areas where there were concerns about competition and an undertaking to not open outlets in the further 12 locations.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>\u201cGiven how few retailers are opening space, this could cost the company in lease assignments/break fees and it shrinks the size of the deal by one-third,\u201d said Charlie Muir-Sands, an analyst at Deutsche Bank. <br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Poundland said it was \u201ccarefully considering the CMA\u2019s announcement, together with the full detail behind it and will make a further announcement in due course\u201d. The company is due to issue a trading update on Tuesday and analysts are hoping it will provide more news on its plans regarding 99p Stores.</p> <p>The retailer could challenge the CMA\u2019s finding that its merger with 99p Stores would lessen competition because they both serve customers looking for \u201cconvenience and value at low and consistent prices\u201d. </p> <p>It could argue that many other stores, such as supermarket chains, sell the homewares, gardening equipment, stationery and groceries that the merging chains stock. But the recently listed business may not want to become embroiled in an uncertain six-month investigation process that would gather evidence from across the industry.</p> <p>The CMA said the merger would mean Poundland, which has about 600 outlets, faced only one other single-price retail competitor on a national scale \u2013 Poundworld. <br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>However, the competition watchdog acknowledged that the retailer also had competition from discount chains B&amp;M, Home Bargains and Poundstretcher. </p>",

      "bodyText": "There was one stetson visible on the Surrey-West Sussex border on Thursday, matched with a fetching purple Western shirt and sunglasses. But it was very much of the fancy dress variety, and modelled by a slightly embarrassed-looking tabloid reporter despatched by her editors to pose for some Dallas-style photographs. It is possibe there is 100bn barrels of oil lying under fields just north of Gatwick airport, as claimed by an energy company. However, whether much of it is ever extracted, let alone provides a significant part of the nation\u2019s energy use, is another thing entirely. The announcement by UK Oil and Gas Investments (UKOG), a small independent explorer, is certainly dramatic: the discovery of a vast supply of oil 3,000ft below the commuter belt landscape. It was, according to Stephen Sanderson, UKOG\u2019s chief executive, a discovery of \u201cnational significance\u201d. He said: \u201cBased on what we\u2019ve found here, we\u2019re looking at between 50 and 100bn barrels of oil in place in the ground. We believe we can recover between 5% and 15% of the oil in the ground, which by 2030 could mean that we produce 10%-to-30% of the UK\u2019s oil demand from within the Weald area.\u201d In a statement to investors, the firm, which is working with Magellan Petroleum of Denver, Colorado, said that more drilling and testing would be required to prove its commercial value, but that the well had \u201cthe potential for significant daily oil production\u201d. It was already known that the area, known as the Horse Hill oilfield after the road adjoining the test drilling site, contained oil. However, UKOG now believes it and the wider Weald Basin area could contain 158m million barrels of oil per square mile, far greater than earlier estimates of about 20m barrels. The news prompted shares in UKOG to jump over 200% in early trading. Talk of a Dallas-type home counties oil boom could be premature. As well as UKOG\u2019s estimates for the total that will be recovered, based on similar geology finds in the US, the relatively populated location and currently low oil price could make even more of the extraction uneconomic. \u201cWho knows at this stage whether this is a truly big discovery and how much oil is really recoverable. The City loves a frothy story like this,\u201d said one analyst who asked not to be named. Then there is the environmental debate, and the prospect of protests. Even though UKOG says the site would not involve the controversial technique of fracking, some demonstrators descended on the test drilling compound last year. More major work would surely prompt larger demonstrations. \u201cAny firm proposing to drill for oil in the region knows it will face huge opposition - as happened at Balcombe, Fernhurst and Wisborough Green,\u201d said Brenda Pollack from Friends of the Earth. \u201cDrilling proposals in Sussex have already been turned down.\u201d Keith Taylor, the Green MEP for south-east England, said the discovery should present an opportunity to have \u201can important national debate about keeping fossil fuels in the ground\u201d. \u201cThe scientific consensus on climate change has never been greater and we have been told that the only way we have a chance of averting catastrophe is by leaving large reserves of oil in the ground.\u201d It would certainly be an incongruous scene for an energy boom, in the lightly wooded commuter belt countryside a few miles from Gatwick\u2019s perimeter, but with the flight paths pointing elsewhere, leaving the local horses and goats, even a field of llamas, to graze in peace. At the moment, the drilling site is nothing much to look at. With the test operations competed last year, all that remains is a packed expanse of dried earth, perhaps two football fields in size, with a battered olive green shipping container sitting at its centre. The only activity on Thursday was the sudden arrival of teams of fencing contractors, sent out to erect a bigger fence around the area in the wake of the publicity and to field queries at the roadside gate. At the nearest house, about 200m away, 19-year-old fashion student Charlotte Jackson said the oil work had been less disruptive than the protesters: \u201cThey were quite noisy, and parked their cars and camped everywhere. It was stressful for the horses and the dogs.\u201d She was, however, somewhat wary about news that she, too, had first heard about from the media: \u201cThe site manager is good and tries to let us know what\u2019s happening. But the company has never told us anything. Maybe they\u2019ll be sucking the oil from under our land \u2013 that\u2019s not really fair, is it?\u201d Another few hundred metres down the road and Elaine Gover, who has lived in the area all her life, watched another truck of fencing material rumble towards the drilling site, as a news helicopter clattered overhead, with a more sanguine air. \u201cYes, when this cottage was built 200 years ago it would have been very peaceful round here. But things are different. It\u2019s the south-east. We\u2019re three miles from Gatwick. If you want peace go to the Highlands.\u201d UKOG\u2019s licence, she added, covers more than 50 square miles of the Weald Basin: \u201cIt\u2019s not going to all happen here. At the most there will be some extra lorries, but it\u2019s not exactly a quiet road now.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Time for a quick afternoon summary: Greece has made a \u20ac450m debt repayment to the International Monetary Fund. The head of the IMF, Christine Lagarde, has rang the alarm bell about the eurozone in a speech that pointed to the risks of low growth and high unemployment. Tens of thousands of people have demonstrated against public spending cuts in towns and cities across France. European markets are slightly up on the day. French investors have shrugged off today\u2019s nationwide strikes - the CAC 40 is up by more than 1% at 5,192 points. The FTSE 100 is up 1% at 7008.12 pence; Germany\u2019s DAX is up 0.74% at 12,125 points. That is all from us today. Thank you for following and for all your comments. Hot off the press: The boss of the International Monetary Fund has made an impassioned plea for governments to make the next decade one of sustainable and inclusive growth that cuts national debt burdens and tackles high unemployment, writes the Guardian\u2019s economics correspondent Philip Inman. Christine Lagarde warned that developed and emerging economies still suffering the after-effects of the 2008 crash must collaborate better to avoid an era of low growth. Speaking ahead of the Washington-based organisation\u2019s spring conference next week, Lagarde welcomed a recovery in the US and UK, which she said was \u201cfirming up\u201d, but voiced concerns about the eurozone and pointed to Russia and Brazil as major trading nations in economic trouble. With overall growth moderate, the global economy continues to face a number of significant challenges. For example, what I have called the \u2018low-low, high-high\u2019 scenario: the risk of low growth-low inflation and high debt-high unemployment persists for a number of advanced economies. Read the full story here. If you are a really keen, you can watch Lagarde speak via this video link. In Paris a large rally has taken place today against public spending cuts. Tens of thousands of people have been marching in towns and cities across France, with the largest demonstration in the capital. Trade union leaders (pictured above) have led the marchers, although one of the largest unions, the CFDT, declined to take part. It argues that the savings the government wants to make are not on the same scale as austerity in other eurozone countries. Airlines, such as Air France, Easyjet and Ryanair, have cancelled hundreds of flights. Radio France has scaled back programming, as part of an ongoing four-week industrial dispute. The Eiffel Tower was closed. Markets are undoubtedly cheered by the news that Greece has made a \u20ac450m debt repayment to the IMF. In the US, the latest weekly jobless claim numbers came in lower than expected. The number of claimants increased by 14,000 to a seasonally adjusted 281,000 for the week ended 4 April, the Labor Department said. Economists had predicted a bigger rise to 285,000. The figures for the week before were also revised down by 1,000. There were no nasty surprise from the Fed last night either, which has helped to underpin investor confidence today. This from CMC\u2019s Michael Hewson: Last nights Fed minutes didn\u2019t tell us anything that we didn\u2019t already know, given the removal of \u201cpatience\u201d from the guidance language, and the differences of opinion articulated by several members since that meeting. The minutes did show us that members were split three ways between a potential lift off [in rates] in June, and a lift off in September with at least two favouring a delay until 2016, which suggests that the consensus needed for a change in policy still remains some way off. Given that these minutes pre dated the most recent economic data we can probably presume given recent comments that those who favoured a June move could well be revising that assessment, indeed Atlanta Fed President Dennis Lockhart stated as much in comments earlier this week, when he talked about a possible July or September window. US markets are relatively quiet: Dow Jones: -0.1% at 17,894.33 S&amp;P 500: +0.2% at 2,087 Nasdaq: +0.0.1% at 4,379.72 Meanwhile European markets have built on earlier gains and the FTSE is back above the 7,000 mark. FTSE 100: +0.9% at 7,001.6 Germany\u2019s DAX: +0.7% at 12,124.68 France\u2019s CAC: +1% at 5,190.18 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB: + 0.8% at 23,776.52 Spain\u2019s IBEX: +0.5% at 11,718.6 It\u2019s official. Greece has successfully completed the repayment of a \u20ac450m IMF loan owed today according to a Greek government official. The payment has been made. Short and sweet. The Greek finance minister said Greece is not entirely happy with the way the negotiations on reforms is being approached by its creditors. The Greek government would like to press ahead with certain urgent reforms before agreeing on others, but the process dictates that the whole package must be agreed upon first. He used the Greek banks\u2019 non-performing loans - 35-40% of all loans - as an example. The government would like to create a bad bank for nom-performing loans to kickstart the flow of credit into the financial system. We are keen to begin implementing this yesterday, but everything is on hold until the negotiations are finished. We want to get on with the low hanging fruit and then move on to the high hanging fruit. The conversation ends with Joseph Stiglitz heaping praise on Varoufakis, and describing the discussion as \u201cspectacular\u201d. Varoufakis says that Greece needs to agree three key things with its eurozone partners: An appropriate primary surplus An investment package for the productive parts of the Greek private sector A serious discussion about Greek debt [he stresses he is not talking about a debt haircut] Varoufakis gives a sense of the pressure felt by the new Greek government immediately on being elected in January. In conversation with American economist and Nobel Laureate Joseph Stiglitz, he said: The day after we were elected we faced an asphyxiatingly tight timetable. We went to our partners and said: can we find some common ground? Can we extend our deadline from the one month we have, so that we can sit around the table and think about what needs to be done? [We needed a plan] to ensure that Greece no longer features in the headlines. Yanis Varoufakis: Reform is a word that resonates in Greece like the word democracy does in Iraq. Reform is a dirty word in Greece. If people hear the word reform in Greece they think their pensions will be cut. Small businesses think VAT will be increased. We need to give reform a good name again. Greece has to become a reformable society again. We are keen to sit down with our partners and prioritise reforms. Yanis Varoufakis, the Greek finance minister, is appearing on a panel at a conference hosted by The Institute for New Economic Thinking at the OECD in Paris. He says that while the crisis in Greece in 2010 threatened the disintegration of the eurozone, the same country is now bringing about consolidation. He hopes the eurozone can end the \u201ctoxic\u201d tendency of one eurozone country turning against another. [Wonder who he is talking about?] Varoufakis says a eurozone crisis was always inevitable. The way we designed the eurozone was crying out for a crisis like this to happen. As my colleague Katie Allen reported over the weekend: The last time UK interest rates were on hold for a longer stretch was between 1940 and 1951 when the UK was ravaged first by war and then by reconstruction efforts, as it was led by a succession of governments (including Clement Attlee, who was prime minister between July 1945 and October 1951). Bank rate was cut from 4% to 2% during 1939 and then stayed there until a hike to 2.5% in November 1951. There was next to no chance of any drama today. Most economists agree that the next move in UK rates will be up, but with annual inflation falling to a record low of zero in February, there is no pressure on the MPC to raise borrowing costs at the current time (despite a backdrop of economic growth). Victoria Clarke, economist at Investec: At present the outlook for UK interest rates is receiving relatively little attention, in part because the general election is stealing the limelight but also because the February record low zero inflation rate has left many thinking lift-off for rates is now a way off. Our suspicion is that we could well see rate lift-off talk re-ignite before too long, particularly if UK recovery momentum builds through the spring against a background of an improving euro area economy, helping the UK\u2019s external position. No pre-election shocks here. The Bank of England\u2019s Monetary Policy Committee has left interest rates on hold at 0.5% and quantitative easing unchanged at \u00a3375bn at its final meeting before the general election on 7 May. Rates have been in hold for the entire duration of this parliament, and longer - the MPC cut rates to an all-time low of 0.5% in March 2009. Further details about the mood of the nine members of the MPC will be revealed on 22 April when the minutes of the meeting are published. Over in Athens, senior government ministers are expressing confidence that Greece will successfully conclude negotiations over reforms with its creditors in the coming weeks. The Guardian\u2019s Helena Smith reports: Sounding more optimistic than perhaps any other leading Greek government official to date, the minister of state, Alekos Flambouraris, said he expected Athens to have sealed a deal with international creditors by the time euro area finance ministers hold their next scheduled meeting on 24 April. \u201cAt the Euro Group on April 24 there will 100 per cent be an agreement,\u201d he told Mega TV on Thursday morning. \u201cThe institutions [EU, ECB and IMF] are taking a hard line, it is the strategy they are following, but we aren\u2019t accepting it and in the end they will back down. It is not in their interest to not release funds,\u201d insisted Flambouraris who is often described as a mentor figure for prime minister Alexis Tsipras. \u201cWe are not going to give in to pressure and we will succeed in getting an agreement.\u201d Some more reaction now to those poor UK trade figures earlier, which showed the trade in goods deficit hit a seven-month high of \u00a310.3bn in January as exports fell but imports rose. The British Chambers of Commerce (BCC) says the trade figures are the latest evidence that the government\u2019s hoped-for rebalancing towards more manufacturing and exports remains elusive. David Kern, the BCC\u2019s chief economist: It is clear that the UK is not yet making adequate process to rebalance the economy towards net exports. Unless we see firm action to improve our export performance, it is not clear how we will sustain strong growth in the long-term. The UK\u2019s trade deficit with the EU reached a record high in the last three months, and while the EU is our largest trading partner, it is vital that we capture more of the export market in the fast growing economies beyond Europe. John Allan, chairman of the Federation of Small Businesses: Despite recent positive signs from the UK\u2019s trade deficit, there has been little indication of sustained improvement in overall export performance. This is partly due to challenging conditions in key export markets such as Europe, but it underlines why supporting businesses to export, particularly in emerging markets, must remain at the forefront of policy thinkers\u2019 minds. Whoever forms the next government must think about how they will help business to find new markets overseas. Support needs to be coherent and link with other advice and training, matching the ambition of our start-ups and small firms that want to grow and develop into the British success stories of the future. Alan Clarke, economist at Scotiabank, said the trade figures backed up other official data suggesting growth may have slowed in the first quarter of 2015 from 0.6% in the fourth quarter of 2014. Unofficial business surveys - notably the PMI surveys on the services, manufacturing and construction sectors - are indicating stronger growth. Clarke: Before today\u2019s trade data it was a coin toss between whether to believe the strong PMI data (which pointed to strong GDP) or the weak output data (pointing to weak GDP). On the back of the trade data, my bias is on the output data. I think we are looking at a very good chance of GDP growth slowing to just 0.4% quarter-on-quarter in Q1. Annual consumer prices deflation slowed to 2.1% in Greece in March, from 2.2% in February. Greece\u2019s EU-harmonised rate of deflation, which brings it into line with the rest of the eurozone, was 1.9% in March, unchanged from February. Greece has been in deflation for the last 25 months, as wage and pension cuts as well as a severe downturn have weighed on prices. Easing deflation in Greece will cheer policymakers at the European Central Bank, which is in the process of pumping \u20ac1.1 trillion into the eurozone financial system in an attempt to boost growth and ward off a deflationary spiral in the wider region. The Greek unemployment rate eased slightly to 25.7% in January from 25.9% in December according to the statistics agency Elstat. The jobless rate has been falling after hitting a record high of 28% in September, but remains more than double the eurozone average of 11.3% in February. There were 1.2m unemployed people in Greece in January, down 13,435 compared with December. Youth unemployment remains high in Greece, at 50.1% in January. A nasty set of trade figures for the UK this morning. The UK\u2019s trade in goods deficit widened unexpectedly in February to a seven-month high of \u00a310.3bn from \u00a39.2bn in January. It was driven by a fall in exports, while imports rose according to the Office for National Statistics. Exports of goods fell by \u00a3900m over the month to \u00a323.2bn - the lowest in almost four and a half years. Imports meanwhile rose by \u00a3300m. The pound fell to its lowest level against the dollar in more than a week after the figures were published. It fell 0.7% to $1.4763. The euro rose against the pound to 72.785p from 72.66p. The export-led recovery so-hoped for by the government has failed to materialise, with economic growth still heavily dependent on the services sector and consumer spending. Rebalancing, what rebalancing? In 2012, George Osborne set a target of doubling UK exports to \u00a31 trillion by 2020. A major part of the plan was to become less dependent on exports to Europe, instead opening up trade links with faster growing economies such as China and India. This didn\u2019t go to plan in Feb according to the ONS: \u201cThe widening of the trade deficit between January and February 2015 mainly reflects a fall in exports of goods to non-EU countries, particularly to the United States.\u201d Paul Hollingsworth, economist at Capital Economics: February\u2019s trade deficit came in worse than expected and will have re-ignited fears that the strong pound and weakness in demand in the euro-zone is acting as a straightjacket on exporters. Before one Greek deadline has passed, we\u2019ve got another one to contend with. Eurozone deputy finance ministers have given Greece a deadline of six-working days to come up with revised reform proposals according to the Greek newspaper Kathimerini. The two sides met in Brussels on Wednesday. The deadline has apparently been set so that a deal can be reached at a Eurogroup meeting on 24 April, unblocking the bailout aid so badly needed by Greece. Without the funds, a \u201cGrexident\u201d - accidental Greek exit from the euro - is a distinct possibility. Michael Hewson chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK, is sceptical that this latest deadline will make any difference. Yesterday\u2019s talks between Greece and the Eurogroup ended with the Eurogroup issuing the Greeks with an ultimatum to present acceptable proposals for fiscal, pension and labour market reform in the next six days, whatever that means. Given that we\u2019ve been here so many times before, ultimatums generally only work when there is a threat of a significant sanction at the end of the deadline, and short of throwing Greece out of the euro it would seem that any sanction is likely to be limited, particularly if Greece continues to muddle through. Greece has paid the IMF according to some on Twitter, but no official confirmation yet... Greek shares are also up this morning, with the ATG index rising 0.7% to 773.09. Top risers: European markets are up this morning. A lack of nasty surprises in the Federal Reserve minutes last night (more on that soon), and expectations that Greece will honour its debt repayment today appear to have boosted investors. FTSE 100: +0.5% at 6,968.92 Germany\u2019s DAX: +0.5% at 12,092.52 France\u2019s CAC: +0.6% at 5,165.77 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB: +0.5% at 23,685.32 Spain\u2019s IBEX: +0.1% at 11,663.6 An unnamed Greek government official has told Reuters that Athens will repay the \u20ac450m instalment due today. The payment has been scheduled and will go out later today. The average price of a UK house rose 0.4% last month, to \u00a3192,970 according to mortgage lender Halifax. It followed a 0.4 fall in prices in February, and beat economists\u2019 expectations of a 0.2% increase. Prices were 7.8% higher than March 2014. However, Halifax prefers to use quarterly comparisons to calculate annual house price changes. On that basis, annual house price inflation slowed to 8.1% in March from 8.3% in February. Martin Ellis, housing economist at Halifax, said house price growth was likely to slow as 2015 progressed. The recent return to real earnings growth for the first time in several years, very low mortgage rates and last December\u2019s stamp duty changes are supporting housing demand. The rising level of house prices in relation to earnings should, however, curb house price growth and activity. The annual rate of house price growth, which has continued to ease in the first quarter of 2015, is forecast to end the year at 3-5%. We will of course be keeping a very close eye on developments in Greece, as well as the other key events and data out today. Please keep your comments coming. The Bank of England\u2019s Monetary Policy Committee will publish its April decision at noon. While no change is expected - rates will almost certainly be left on hold at 0.5% and quantitative easing remain unchanged at \u00a3375bn - it is a historic moment. It is the final decision before the general election on 7 May, and rates have been on hold for the entire parliament. The last time interest rates were on hold for a longer stretch was between 1940 and 1951. Before that at 9.30am the Office for National Statistics will publish the latest UK trade figures for February, revealing whether or not the government made any progress on its export drive during the month. IMF boss Christine Lagarde will give a speech in Washington at 10.30am (15.30 UK time) on the state of the economy, the challenges, and the risks in a pre-IMF/World Bank spring meetings address. In the US, the latest weekly jobless claim numbers will give us a snapshot of the labour market, which has disappointed recently. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Another day, another crucial moment for Greece. The government must repay an International Monetary Fund loan of \u20ac450m (\u00a3326m) or risk a default. The Greek finance minister Yanis Varoufakis spent last weekend reassuring IMF managing director Christine Lagarde that Greece would honour its debt and meet the deadline. Repayment seemed all the more likely after Greece raised \u20ac1.14bn on Wednesday at an auction of six-month Treasury bills. But markets will want reassurance that the payment has been made. A failure to repay the debt would be significant, potentially triggering a messy default. And while a repayment of the loan would trigger instant relief in markets, a high degree of uncertainty about the future of Greece persists. There is still no agreement between Greece and its creditors over a package of reforms. Agreement is essential if Greece is to secure another tranche of funding under the existing bailout agreement. Hold on tight.",

Christine Lagarde warned that developed and emerging economies still suffering the after-effects of the 2008 crash must collaborate better to avoid an era of low growth. Speaking ahead of the Washington-based organisation\u2019s spring conference next week, Lagarde welcomed a recovery in the US and UK, which she said was \u201cfirming up\u201d, but voiced concerns about the eurozone and pointed to Russia and Brazil as major trading nations in economic trouble. She said: \u201cWith overall growth moderate, the global economy continues to face a number of significant challenges. For example, what I have called the \u2018low-low, high-high\u2019 scenario: the risk of low growth-low inflation and high debt-high unemployment persists for a number of advanced economies.\u201d Calling for extra effort to rebuild battered consumer and business confidence, she invoked speeches by former US president John F Kennedy and Britain\u2019s wartime leader Winston Churchill, who she quoted saying: \u201cI never worry about action, only inaction.\u201d Lagarde, a right-of-centre former French finance minister, has become increasingly frustrated at the pace of progress in recent years on policies to spur growth, especially in the struggling 19-member eurozone. While the European Central Bank has joined the Bank of England, the Bank of Japan and the US Federal Reserve in printing money to cut the cost of credit and stimulate demand, the IMF believes much of the ECB\u2019s extra funding remains stuck in the banking system and unable to reach consumers and small businesses. Lagarde also criticised European governments for allowing thousands of zombie companies to continue rolling over unsustainable debts seven years after the crash. In a clear reference to the stagnation suffered by Japan over two decades \u2013 during which the government and the courts blocked petitions to wind up companies that were effectively insolvent \u2013 she said: \u201cEffective insolvency frameworks are crucial to tackle the private debt overhang and deal with the total stock of \u20ac900bn [\u00a3654bn] in non-performing loans that is blocking credit channels.\u201d The organisation, best known for acting as lender of last resort to Greece, Ireland and Portugal, has come under fire for supporting austerity programmes as the price of sovereign rescue operations. Critics of the IMF have accused the organisation of doing more to delay the recovery of the eurozone area by imposing strict repayments schedules on indebted countries. Greece made a \u20ac450m debt repayment to the IMF on Thursday that many economists \u2013 and the Greek government \u2013 have said it cannot afford. Echoing a report last week by the IMF, Lagarde said policies to spur growth and reform labour markets were the best remedies to reduce debts. The report argued that potential growth in advanced economies was expected to increase slightly, from an average of about 1.3% a year in the last six years to 1.6% until 2020, but not reach the 2.25% average seen between 2001 and 2007 without further effort by individual governments and renewed collaboration through organisations such as the IMF.",

Like David Cameron, Wilson had been going around the country insisting that his long-term economic plan was working. The widening of the trade deficit, though, cast doubt on whether the government\u2019s export drive following the devaluation of the pound in 1967 was actually delivering. As it happens, the rebalancing of the economy was a lot more successful under Labour in the late 1960s than it has been under the current government since 2010. In 1970, Britain had a small trade deficit in goods worth 0.2% of national income. That became a surplus of 0.7% of GDP once services were included. In 2010, the year the Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition arrived in office, the deficit in goods was 6.3% of GDP and there was a deficit of 2.4% of GDP for goods and services combined. By 2014, the deficit in goods was 6.7% of GDP, while the deficit for goods and services combined showed a slight improvement to 1.9% of GDP. What\u2019s more, the latest figures are far from encouraging. Exports in February were at their lowest in four years, while the deficit with the eurozone in the last three months was the highest since comparable records began in 1998. Neither the strength of the pound nor the softening of demand in the US is helping matters. Looking back at the historical data, the long-term deterioration in Britain\u2019s trade position is glaringly obvious. It is not just that it has been 32 years since there was a surplus in trade in goods. It is that each economic cycle has started with a bigger trade deficit. The recovery from the recession of the early 1980s began with a surplus on trade in goods and services of 2% of GDP. When the recovery began from the downturn of the 1990s, there was a combined deficit of 0.3% of GDP. When the economy started to pick up from the slump of 2008-09, the deficit was 2.4% of GDP. Times change. Back in 1970, the trade deficit was front-page news. A chancellor who said his economic plan was working while presiding over a trade deficit worth almost 7% of GDP would have been derided.

      "bodyText": "Britain will go a whole parliament without an increase in interest rates for the first time since the immediate aftermath of the second world war, after the Bank of England left official borrowing costs on hold. Threadneedle Street said it had left the bank rate unchanged at 0.5% following the meeting of its nine-strong monetary policy committee, extending a run that began more than six years ago when Gordon Brown was prime minister and Alistair Darling chancellor. The last time interest rates remained unchanged for the duration of an entire full-length parliament was between July 1945 and February 1950, when Clement Attlee was in Downing Street. That formed part of a prolonged period of low interest rates, with borrowing costs standing at 2% between 1932 and 1951, apart from a short period when they were raised to reassure financial markets at the start of the second world war. But in the history of the Bank of England, which stretches back to 1694, interest rates have never been lower than they have been consistently since March 2009. Borrowing costs were cut from 5% to 0.5% in the months following the collapse of Lehman Brothers in September 2008, the pivotal moment of the global financial crisis. The MPC is delaying the timing of its next meeting, with members due to make up their minds regarding interest rates on 8 May, the day after the election. It will announce its decision on 11 May. Although the economy has been growing steadily since the start of 2013, the lack of any cost pressures has forced financial markets to push back their forecasts of when borrowing costs will be raised. Sharply declining oil prices have led to a fresh fall in inflation, and the City now believes the period of 0.5% interest rates will continue for some time after the election. There is a possibility that the next set of inflation figures, due out next week, will show that the cost of living in March was lower than it was a year earlier. The MPC will have known the inflation figure before making Thursday\u2019s decision.

      "bodyText": "Britain\u2019s trade deficit with the rest of the world widened sharply in February, in the latest sign that economic growth may have moderated in the first quarter of the year. The Office for National Statistics said the deficit on goods and services was \u00a32.9bn in February, up from \u00a31.5bn in January, with the worsening picture mainly caused by a slowdown in goods exported to non-EU countries, particularly the US. George Osborne made boosting exports a key part of his \u201clong-term economic plan\u201d but the deficit on goods alone has barely budged. It was \u00a39.9bn in February 2014, and \u00a310.3bn in February this year \u2013 largely offset by a \u00a37.5bn surplus on services. City analysts warned that the worse-than-expected performance suggested the economic recovery may be waning. Alan Clarke, of Scotiabank, said: \u201cI think we are looking at a very good chance of GDP growth slowing to just 0.4% q/q in Q1\u201d. That would be considerably weaker than the 0.6% registered in the final three months of 2014. Over a three-month period, the difference between imports and exports looks more stable, narrowing by \u00a30.4bn, to \u00a36.5bn \u2013 though Britain\u2019s trade shortfall with the rest of the EU reached \u00a321.1bn, the highest level since records began in 1998. Official figures on GDP growth for the first quarter of 2015 are due to be announced on 28 April, at a critical moment in an election campaign dominated by the economy. David Kern, chief economist of the British Chambers of Commerce, said: \u201cUnless we see firm action to improve our export performance, it is not clear how we will sustain strong growth in the long term. The UK\u2019s trade deficit with the EU reached a record high in the last three months, and while the EU is our largest trading partner, it is vital that we capture more of the export market in the fast-growing economies beyond Europe.\u201d However, Howard Archer, of consultancy IHS Global Insight, said trade might start to make a positive contribution to UK growth later in the year if conditions in the critical EU market start to improve. \u201cWhile UK GDP growth will likely remain largely reliant on domestic demand, it is realistic to hope that exports will increasingly benefit as 2015 progresses from a significant pick-up in eurozone growth supported by a weak euro, low oil prices and major ECB stimulus.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The world\u2019s top credit agencies are dumping claims that their research is \u201cindependent\u201d in a shift that follows accusations of bias and allegations that their faulty ratings helped trigger the worst financial crisis in living memory. According to an academic paper from Harvard Business School, McGraw Hill\u2019s Standard &amp; Poor\u2019s and Moody\u2019s, the two largest ratings agencies, have all but culled claims about the independence of their research from the documents they must file with the US\u2019s top financial watchdog, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Harvard professor Robert Eccles and researcher Tim Youmans assessed McGraw Hill\u2019s 10-K filings with the SEC \u2013 annual, mandatory and comprehensive reports about a company\u2019s performance \u2013 between 2004 and 2014. They found \u201ca confusing picture\u201d. \u201cFor unexplained reasons, over the past 10 years McGraw Hill appears to be continuously diminishing, especially since 2012, the strength of its claims regarding the independent and unbiased objective nature of the credit ratings it gives to the debt issues of thousands of companies,\u201d the authors found. Trillions of dollars worth of debt are issued by companies, cities and countries looking to raise money each year. Between them S&amp;P and Moody\u2019s accounted for over 83% of the ratings issued, according to the study. All debt issuers who want institutional investors must be assigned a credit rating from one of the handful of recognised agencies, agencies which have come under fire in recent years for the quality and independence of their work. In February S&amp;P paid $1.5bn to resolve lawsuits over its rosy ratings for mortgage securities that turned toxic in the run-up to the 2008 financial crisis. In its complaint the Justice Department said S&amp;P had delayed updates to its systems and weakened its criteria in a desire to gain more business from the investment banks that issued the securities. S&amp;P unsuccessfully sought to have the case thrown out arguing statements about independence and objectivity highlighted by the federal government as alleged fraudulent misrepresentations were corporate \u201cpuffery\u201d and not meant to be taken at face value by investors. Judge David Carter called the argument \u201cdeeply and unavoidably troubling\u201d. Eccles said it was clear that the ratings agencies were now taking extra care in the use of the term \u201cindependent\u201d. \u201cWe can not say who made those decisions or why but they are doing it,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it\u2019s a pretty huge change.\u201d In its 10-K filings for years 2004-2011, McGraw Hill \u201casserted multiple times in each filing that they provided independent credit ratings or words to that effect\u201d, according to the paper. In 2012 McGraw Hill dropped the modifier \u201cindependent\u201d before mentions of \u201ccredit ratings\u201d and but continued to describe itself as providing \u201cindependent\u201d ratings benchmarks. In 2013\u2019s McGraw Hill described itself as an \u201cindependent provider\u201d of credit ratings and benchmarks, \u201cdistancing the claim of independence from the nature of its ratings entirely and moving it to the nature of the firm\u201d, the authors report. \u201cNowhere in the 2012 or 2013 form 10-K filings did McGraw Hill claim that they provided independent credit ratings or any words to that effect.\u201d Last year\u2019s report continued the same absence of claims about the independence of its credit ratings, however, McGraw Hill did state it would \u201cstrive to be the leading provider of transparent and independent benchmarks and ratings\u201d. A review of Moody\u2019s 10-K filings for 2004-2007 reveals that the company removed \u201cany and all\u201d statements claiming that its ratings are independent after 2008. Eccles said while much of the criticism of the agencies had centred on the ratings they issue, the focus of this study was on the agencies disclosures about themselves. \u201cCredit agencies are embedded in the financial system. The assumption is the ratings they make are independent. If the organisations themselves are backing off from that language, can you count on them or not?\u201d he said. The paper, Implied Materiality and Material Disclosure of Credit Ratings, is to be published in the Journal of Applied Corporate Finance. It is the first of three papers Eccles and Youmans will publish on the credit rating agencies. The second will look at credit ratings governance issues and the third at the business models of the institutions.",

      "bodyText": "The Co-operative Group has returned to profit and reduced its debt mountain as it tries to draw on its traditional community links to bounce back from a tumultuous year. Chief executive Richard Pennycook declared the \u201crescue phase\u201d of the mutual\u2019s turnaround complete. \u201cThe hard work of rebuilding the Co-operative Group for the next generation ... is now under way.\u201d Pennycook said the group would be going \u201cback to the future\u201d by emphasising its community links and campaigning on issues important to the 8.5 million members who own the business. \u201cWe are owned by members in the communities in which they live and work. Nobody else can say that,\u201d he said. However, Britain\u2019s biggest mutual, which was founded in 1844, said members would have to wait until the end of a three-year recovery plan in 2017 for a resumption of dividend payments. The last payment, of \u00a334m, was made in 2013. The Co-op made a net profit of \u00a3216m in the year to January as it benefited from the sales of its pharmacy and farming businesses. Borrowings at the group, which is now focused on food, funerals, insurance and legal services, were cut to \u00a3808m from \u00a31.4bn. The improvement in profits came despite a 3% fall in revenues to \u00a39.4bn after the Co-op disposed of some grocery stores and sales at its funeral business fell as a result of last year\u2019s low death rate. Pennycook admitted that without the profit from the pharmacy sale and property disposals, the Co-op would \u201cat best, have broken even\u201d but said he expected \u201csteady improvements\u201d in profits from now on. Last year\u2019s profit compares with a \u00a32.3bn loss in 2013 following the discovery of a \u00a31.5bn black hole at the group\u2019s banking armalong with a writedown of the value of former Somerfield stores. In a disastrous year, the Co-op Bank came close to collapse and lost its mutual status. It was rescued by bondholders, led by US hedge funds, in a deal that reduced the Co-op Group\u2019s stake to a minority holding of 20%. The bank\u2019s former chairman, Paul Flowers was fined for drug possession last spring. The Co-op Group\u2019s former chief executive Euan Sutherland quit in March after a furore over his pay. There were encouraging signs in the Co-op\u2019s grocery business where sales at established stores rose 0.4%. Within that, sales at smaller convenience stores rose by 3.2%. The chain which is the UK\u2019s fifth biggest food retailer by market share and has 2,800 convenience and medium-sized stores, opened 82 new convenience stores and refurbished more than 700 shops. It hopes to add a further 100 smaller stores this year. It also plans to slim down its portfolio of 717 poorly performing larger stores by disposing of up to 75 sites a year. It sold 37 last year. Pennycook said store revamps were starting to pay off, with refurbished stores seeing \u201chigh single-digit uplifts in sales\u201d. He added: \u201cWhere we want to grow is in the convenience part of the market, and in that part of the market we\u2019re growing market share.\u201d Pennycook admitted there was still much work to do in a tough market locked in a supermarket price war and where bigger rivals such as Sainsbury\u2019s and Waitrose are rapidly opening more convenience stores. But he said: \u201cI\u2019m very confident we are heading in the right direction.\u201d The former Asda and Royal Mail boss Allan Leighton, whose father ran a Co-op store, was recently appointed as the society\u2019s first independent non-executive chairman after a shakeup of its governance structure. He is putting together a new smaller, plc-style board, composed of a majority of independent directors. They are expected to be appointed ahead of the group\u2019s annual meeting in May, with further elected directors set to join the board following the meeting. About 2.9 million members are eligible to vote at the annual meeting. They will be asked whether the society should continue to make donations to the Co-operative party, which is affiliated to the Labour party.",

    "webTitle": "Gatwick oil find 'could produce 100bn barrels'", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "An oil company claimed on Thursday that it had found the equivalent of 100bn barrels of oil close to Gatwick airport, sending the firm\u2019s share price racing in the City and prompting immediate controversy with environmentalists. The find would have \u201cnational significance\u201d and be the largest of its kind in 30 years, according to the small independent explorer, UK Oil and Gas Investments (UKOG), which is working alongside a larger US firm on the project. Shares in UKOG jumped more than 200% in frantic trading although veteran analysts dismissed talk of a Sussex oil boom as excessive hype. UKOG admitted that while up to 100bn barrels may be in place 3,000ft (900 metres) below the Sussex countryside, only 3-15% of the total would be recovered, based on similar finds in the US. \u201cWe think we\u2019ve found a very significant discovery here, probably the largest [onshore in the UK] in the last 30 years, and we think it has national significance,\u201d Stephen Sanderson, UKOG\u2019s chief executive, told the BBC. Analysts suggest the Horse Hill oilfield \u2013 already dubbed by some as Britain\u2019s Dallas \u2013 could hold 158m barrels of oil per square mile, a significant increase on reports last year claiming it could hold 20m barrels. The majority of the oil was discovered when UKOG workers drilled the deepest well in the region. Sanderson said the find would \u201ccomprehensively change the understanding of the area\u2019s potential oil resources\u201d. He added: \u201cBased on what we\u2019ve found here, we\u2019re looking at between 50 and 100bn barrels of oil in place in the ground. We believe we can recover between 5% and 15% of the oil in the ground, which by 2030 could mean that we produce 10% to 30% of the UK\u2019s oil demand from within the Weald area.\u201d The firm, which is working with Denver-based Magellan Petroleum, told investors more drilling and testing would be required to prove its commercial value \u2013 but that the well had \u201cthe potential for significant daily oil production\u201d. Senior analysts said a lot was being made of the find because of its interesting location and the fact that oil was in the public eye because of the drop in prices and the row over fossil fuels. \u201cWho knows at this stage whether this is a truly big discovery and how much oil is really recoverable. The City loves a frothy story like this,\u201d said one analyst who asked not to be named. UKOG has claimed it can extract the oil without resorting to the controversial technique of fracking, where chemicals are pumped into the ground to bring out the oil. Keith Taylor, a Green party MEP for south-east England, said some experts disputed whether chemicals could do this and the discovery raised wider matters of concern. \u201cThis huge oil find is the perfect opportunity for us to have an important national debate about keeping fossil fuels in the ground. The scientific consensus on climate change has never been greater and we have been told that the only way we have a chance of averting catastrophe is by leaving large reserves of oil in the ground.\u201d Brenda Pollack, a campaigner for Friends of the Earth, said the prospect of \u201cdirty oil extraction\u201d in southern England would alarm local communities and put fracking firmly on the region\u2019s election agenda. \u201cAny firm proposing to drill for oil in the region knows it will face huge opposition \u2013 as happened at Balcombe, Fernhurst and Wisborough Green. Drilling proposals in Sussex have already been turned down.\u201d Doug Parr, chief scientist at Greenpeace UK, said: \u201cDotting the English countryside with drilling rigs and pipelines to squeeze the last drop of oil out of Britain doesn\u2019t make any sense. \u201cTo gleefully rub your hands at a new fossil fuel discovery you need to turn the clock back to the 19th century and ignore everything we have learned about climate change since. We already have more than enough coal, oil, and gas reserves to fry the planet.\u201d But Ken Cronin, chief executive of the oil industry lobby group UKOOG, said the public had no reason to be worried and he argued these kinds of finds could play a major role helping the UK\u2019s economic recovery. \u201cWe have been drilling for oil and gas onshore in the UK for over 100 years. There are a number of sites in the south of England that have been producing oil for many years with great care for the environment and with no impact on local communities.\u201d ProfDavid Elmes, who researches the oil industry at the Warwick Business School and has worked for BP, said the discovery should be treated with caution. \u201cWhat we can get out of the ground and whether that is commercially viable to extract are much lower figures. \u201cHow much the local community is affected will also depend on how much can be produced that is economically viable. Small fields can be serviced by tankers but the size suggested here would need a pipeline. \u2026 What\u2019s commercial will also depend on the oil price at the time. Global oil prices have fallen dramatically in recent times with no sense of a strong recovery just yet.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Each month, Ahmed Ismail makes his ritual trip to a money-transfer agent. Like a lot of Somalis living in Australia, he sends money home to his relatives in Bosaso, in the country\u2019s north-east. He knows exactly what it pays for. \u201cNormally, I\u2019d cover my two cousins\u2019 high school fees,\u201d says Ismail, who owns a travel agency in Melbourne. \u201cAnd my cousins in the UK and the US cover food, housing, all the other expenses.\u201d That also means, if he doesn\u2019t send the money \u2013 usually meagre sums of $200 or $300 \u2013 he knows exactly what his cousins cannot afford that month. That pressure has been building since October, when Westpac, the last big bank to facilitate money transfers, suddenly announced it was exiting the industry. A three-month stay imposed by the federal court in December expired on 31 March. Ismail\u2019s family in Bosaso cannot understand why the lifeline they have depended on for 20 years might not come through this month. \u201cThey don\u2019t understand how it\u2019s not possible. Some of them think it\u2019s a joke, or that I don\u2019t want to send them money,\u201d Ismail told Guardian Australia. \u201cAt the same time they have friends and colleagues who are still receiving money, and they want to know how ... It causes a lot of issues within the family.\u201d Somalia has no formal banking system, nor international money-transfer companies such as Western Union. Instead Somalis abroad rely on a system called \u201chawala\u201d, Arabic for transfer, to send $1.3bn home each year. That includes about $33m from Australia, more than twice what the country gives to Somalia each year in foreign aid. Under hawala, Ismail\u2019s money agent in Melbourne corresponds with another in Somalia, confirming that the Melbourne agent has received the $300 from Ismail. Shortly after, the Somali-side agent makes an equivalent sum available to Ismail\u2019s relatives. The debt between the two agents is settled later, usually by moving money between traditional bank accounts. High-profile cases of the system being used to fund militant groups have led to regulators around the world cracking down on banks helping to square the accounts of money agents. Westpac persisted with the service long after its rivals had quit, starting with the Commonwealth bank in 2011. By October the risk calculations had become too high, as had the cost of complying with stringent new domestic and global regulation, much of it aimed at stopping the funding of militia such as al-Shabaab, the group responsible for last week\u2019s attack that killed almost 150 people in neighbouring Kenya. The last US bank to facilitate money transfers to Somalia also ceased doing so in February. Remittances from Britain, too, have been severely constricted by the decision by Barclays in 2013 to close money agents\u2019 accounts. Purely as a cost-benefit proposition, the banks\u2019 decision makes sense, said Matt Collin, an economist with the Center for Global Development in Washington DC. \u201cTransfers are a pretty marginal business for these banks,\u201d he said. \u201cInstead of taking a very costly approach of looking at each individual remitter and deciding if they\u2019re OK, they\u2019re saying: this is too costly, the cost of compliance is too high. It\u2019s easier for us to just let these accounts go.\u201d These calculations made in skyscrapers in Sydney or London have a huge impact on the family of Melbourne chaplain Abdiahman Mohamud, in Mogadishu. He says the $300 he sends his cousins each month literally keeps them from starving. \u201cI can understand where the banks are coming from. They have an obligation to their shareholders to minimise risk,\u201d he said. \u201cBut at what cost? Somalia is an abstract place, but real people\u2019s lives are at risk. People are going to go hungry.\u201d His relatives are \u201cin a state of shock\u201d, he says. \u201cThey\u2019ve got a little bit of money left from last month, but after that it\u2019s done.\u201d To keep their families afloat, Ismail, Mohamud and the 6,000 other Somalis in Australia now have two options. \u201cFirst, to find an alternative legal channel which costs more. Send the money via Dubai for example,\u201d Ismail says. Apart from trusting a Dubai-based broker, that involves converting money from Australian dollars into Emirati dirhams and back into the US dollars used in Somalia, incurring fees that mean his relatives receive substantially less each month. \u201cAnd the second option is unregulated or illegal ways to send money. Finding out who\u2019s flying to Somalia, families pooling together to give them $15,000 or $20,000 in cash,\u201d he says. That\u2019s an even bigger gamble, especially for the cash mule. Get caught and the money gets confiscated. \u201cYou have let down 10 or 15 families who are depending on you,\u201d Ismail says. He declines to say which option he is taking. \u201cI\u2019ve got cousins and family that need to survive, and I\u2019ll need to find a way to send them money. I have to do it.\u201d Even as means of halting terrorist financing, Collin says, cracking down on money-transfers might be \u201ccounter-productive\u201d. Hawala is hard to track. But accounting for cash wired through a maze of different countries and systems, or smuggled by travellers, is impossible. \u201cYou\u2019ve just pushed a large chunk of remittances into informal sectors that by definition cannot be inspected,\u201d he says. The Australian government is not blind to the problem. In December the attorney general\u2019s department formed a remittance working group to find an alternative way for the money to keep flowing. But progress is slow, a solution far off. In the meantime, Mohamud worries for his cousins, particularly the teenage boys no longer able to afford school. \u201cThey have to do what they can to survive, and that can be really bad stuff,\u201d he says.",
