The Pefo projected a balanced budget in 2015-16; now budget deficits are forecast for another 10 years.</p> <p>First, a word of caution: projecting 10 years ahead requires a stack of assumptions, mostly involving no changes on the spending or revenue side, which is a bit absurd given the government hasn\u2019t even committed to education funding after 2017-18. Secondly, it requires a lot of assumptions about the state of the economy. It\u2019s hard enough knowing what GDP growth will be 12 months ahead, let alone 120 months.</p> <p>Plainly the graph above is meant to soften us up for either expenditure cuts or taxation increases in the May budget.</p> <p>Stevens is right \u2013 we did vote for things we want as a society, such as the national disability insurance scheme (NDIS) and the Gonski education reforms. The ALP, however, would argue with the governor\u2019s suggestion that they are not fully funded. In last year\u2019s<a href=\"http://budget.gov.au/2013-14/content/glossy/NDIS_policy/download/NDIS.pdf\"> budget for example</a> they provided details on how NDIS would be funded through measures such as \u201creforms to the government\u2019s assistance for private health insurance, reforms to retirement incomes and the phase-out of the net medical expenses tax offset\u201d.</p> <p>But regardless, government expenditure is set to jump, because the big increases in expenditure for both the NDIS and education reforms hit the budget books for the first time this year when the 2017-18 financial year is included. The problem is our revenue isn\u2019t jumping with it.</p> <p>Despite Hockey talking about a \u201ctsunami\u201d of government expenditure about to hit us, we need not get too overwrought. Government spending will actually remain small on a world scale. Combined, Australian governments spend only the equivalent of about 37% of our GDP \u2013 less than governments in the US, UK and Japan, let alone the European nations.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"General government expenditure (2012)\">  <iframe src=\"https://charts.datawrapper.de/tpywB/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"480\" height=\"600\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>Part of the reason is that we spend a lot less on defence (1.7% of GDP compared with the US with 4.4%), but also because our health spending and welfare and pension systems are more efficient. Last week, for example, German<a href=\"https://www.allianz.at/v_1396336400000/privatkunden/media-newsroom/news/aktuelle-news/pa-download/20140401studie-pension-sustainability-index.pdf\"> finance company Allianz</a> named Australia\u2019s pension system as the \u201cmost sustainable\u201d in the world.</p> <p>What we do fund we do efficiently, and this includes things done to reduce inequality. This is important \u2013 an efficient tax system needs to both redistribute wealth efficiently and raise money \u2013 and it\u2019s generally accepted that the most efficient way is by taxing consumption.</p> <p>However, as Parkinson noted, our consumption habits have changed since the GST was introduced. Unsurprisingly, we now spend more than before on goods and services not taxed by the GST, which reduces the amount collected from taxes. To help reduce the deficit we can respond by either raising the GST like many other nations did following the global financial crisis \u2013 which just pushes the problem off for another few years \u2013 or we can broaden the base by including more items to be taxed by the GST, which not only solves this problem, but also makes the tax more efficient.</p> <p>However there is a problem that although broadening the GST will make the revenue collection more efficient, it is also likely to make the system more regressive:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Household expenditure on GST free items\">  <iframe src=\"https://charts.datawrapper.de/VJnpZ/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"480\" height=\"420\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>This doesn\u2019t mean we shouldn\u2019t do it, it just means great care needs to be taken to ensure the burden doesn\u2019t fall on the poorest.</p> <p>Parkinson also noted the problem of income tax bracket creep \u2013 where due to inflation people get pushed into a higher tax bracket.

Speaking in Brazil, the chancellor said billions of pounds of extra loans would be made available to UK firms competing in global markets after the Bank broadened the support it provides to lenders. Osborne has set British companies a target of doubling exports to \u00a31tn by 2020. The chancellor's comments came before the release of Tuesday's quarterly economic survey from the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC), which shows service export orders at their strongest on record and manufacturing export orders at their highest for more than three years. Following Osborne's announcement, loans guaranteed by Britain's export credit agency, UK Export Finance (UKEF), will now fall under the Bank's sterling monetary framework, which provides financial help in times of unexpected stress by agreeing to provide liquid assets in exchange for high-quality collateral. Osborne said: \"Banks will now have access to a special Bank of England facility that will make it much less risky for them to extend loans to our exporters. That should mean billions of extra lending will be made available to our exporters. And it will mean cheaper lending, saving potentially millions of pounds for large projects.\" The Treasury said the scheme could help reduce the cost of private-sector export finance loans by up to 0.1% and was the second part of a package that included the budget announcement of a doubling to \u00a33bn of the UKEF publicly funded lending facility to exporters. Sources said there had been a sea change in attitudes, towards how to back exports. Osborne said his aim was to give the UK the most competitive export finance in Europe and put it on a par with that of the US, the only other developed nation that offers help to private sector export finance through its central bank. \"For decades we have not been exporting enough \u2013 not just to Brazil, but to all the fastest growing markets in the world. So I am confronting that historic weakness head-on.\" Commenting on the BCC's latest quarterly survey, the organisation's director general, John Longworth, said: \"Confidence is high and our members are determined to continue driving the recovery. We are brilliant at services and very successful at exporting our knowledge-based industries all over the world. This includes everything from accountancy and marketing through to literature and the IT sector.\" The BCC said its survey was upbeat overall, with six of the indicators for manufacturing \u2013 domestic sales, domestic orders, employment expectations, investment in plant and machinery, investment in training, and turnover confidence \u2013 at record levels. But it said the fall in employment in the service sector over the past three months was a concern. Inflation was the biggest worry for manufacturing and service sector companies. \"Access to finance and export support also remain vital if we are to secure a truly great economic recovery\", Longworth said. \"Only by repairing our broken business finance system will viable, growing firms gain access to the capital that will allow them to invest in their staff and machinery, and enter new markets. And despite recent falls, inflation remains a key concern for our businesses, and the Bank of England must strive to maintain an investment-friendly environment, with clarity on forward interest rates and action to keep inflation low.\"",

      "bodyText": "Barclays has settled a \u00a370m Libor court case that will spare its former boss Bob Diamond and other senior colleagues from testifying in a lawsuit that the bank had been vigorously defending. Guardian Care Homes had alleged that the bank had mis-sold it two interest rate swaps worth \u00a370m that were linked to Libor, the benchmark interest rate used to price financial products worth about \u00a3300tn around the world. The case was being watched closely by the banking industry, which is already making compensation claims to customers mis-sold interest rate swaps, amid fears that it could encourage more customers to bring cases linked to Libor. Barclays argued that the swaps bought in 2007 and 2008 cost it millions of pounds as interest rates fell following the 2008 banking crisis. Diamond, who is now building a banking business in Africa, left Barclays in July 2012 in the wake of the furore caused by the bank's \u00a3290m fine for rigging Libor, the first significant penalty for attempts to manipulate the rate, but one that has since been eclipsed by rival banks. He and others, including the former co-heads of the investment bank, Rich Ricci and Jerry del Missier, were also possible witnesses in the high court when the trial was due to begin at the end of this month. But a settlement has been reached under which Barclays will restructure a loan, thought to be worth about \u00a340m, to Guardian Care Homes' owner, Graiseley. This led to the legal action being dropped. A Barclays spokesman said: \"In response to discussions with Graiseley, in order to support the ongoing viability of Graiseley's care home business, the parties have agreed to a commercial restructuring of Graiseley's debt, which reflects the impact of changes in conditions in this sector over the last few years. Graiseley has withdrawn the litigation.\" Graiseley did not immediately comment. Until last week, Barclays had been arguing that the case, which had already involved a string of court appearances, was \"without merit\", and argued that the care homes operator owed it \u00a370m. The Libor element of the proceedings had been added after Barclays was fined for rigging the benchmark rate and the case had been delayed while the bank failed in its attempts to have this element thrown out. Among the twists and turns of the proceedings were those in January last year, when the court had ordered the identities of more than 100 current and former employees of Barclays to be revealed despite their attempts to remain anonymous. They included the former finance director Chris Lucas and Diamond's predecessor John Varley, whose emails were scrutinised during the regulatory investigation that led to the fine. At the time, the bank and the judge stressed that this did not mean those individuals were involved in rigging Libor. Court papers released during the proceedings also appeared to suggest that a Barclays investment fund operated by a Singapore trader had been manipulating Libor, although the bank had argued the evidence was not relevant. It was the first trial related to Libor to reach the courts and was due to carry on for a number of weeks, during which time a number of former and current Barclays employees were thought likely to be called at witnesses. It is believed Barclays' legal bill to defend the case has already amounted to more than \u00a310m. Since Barclays was fined for Libor rigging, a number of other banks have been fined, including Royal Bank of Scotland, which paid \u00a3390m to regulators in the UK and US, Swiss bank UBS, which was fined \u00a3940m, and Dutch bank Rabobank which was fined \u00a3662m. Money broker Icap was fined \u00a355m, while regulators are continuing their investigation into the manipulation of the rate.

      "bodyText": "Britain's biggest drug company, GlaxoSmithKline, has been rocked by fresh bribery and corruption allegations after admitting that it was investigating its business in Iraq. The move comes months after the company promised to crackdown on illegal practices in the wake of another emerging markets scandal that involved the company bribing doctors with cash and sexual favours in China. GSK, which promised to \"root out corruption wherever it exists\" in the wake of the Chinese revelations, was on Monday forced to admit that it was \"investigating allegations of improper conduct in our Iraq business\". The FTSE 100 company said it was urgently looking into whistleblower claims that it hired 16 Iraqi government doctors and pharmacists to act as sales representatives and improperly boost its sales. Details of the allegations, which are said to have originated in 2012 but continue to this day, were sent to company executives by a whistleblower, according to the Wall Street Journal. The emails claim the alleged malpractice breaches the UK's Bribery Act and the US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, which ban bribery of foreign officials. A GSK spokesman said: \"We have zero tolerance for unethical or illegal behaviour. We employ fewer than 60 people in Iraq in our pharmaceutical operation and these allegations relate to a small number of individuals in the country. \"However, we are investigating whether there have been any improper conduct and these investigations are ongoing.\" The move comes as the Chinese authorities continue to investigate allegations that some senior GSK Chinese executives broke the law in a \u00a3320m cash and sexual favours bribery scandal. GSK's chief executive, Sir Andrew Witty, has described the Chinese allegations as shameful and said: \"To be crystal clear, we have zero tolerance to this sort of behaviour.\" Witty, who was paid \u00a36.5m last year, had promised to root out corruption and said the company would stop paying doctors to promote drugs. Witty dispatched Abbas Hussain, the drugmaker's head of emerging markets, to Shanghai last year to apologise to the Chinese authorities for the scandal and promised the company was taking the charges extremely seriously. Hussain, the brother of former England cricketer Nasser Hussain, said: \"Certain senior executives of GSK China who know our systems well appear to have acted outside of our processes and controls which breaches Chinese law.\" GSK's eventual admission of guilt last July came a month after the company said a four-month internal investigation had found \"no evidence of corruption or bribery in our China business\". The UK's Serious Fraud Office and the US justice department are being kept informed of the Chinese investigation. In December, Witty promised a change of corporate culture in the wake of the scandal. He said pharmaceutical firms must end the decades-long standard practice of paying independent doctors to promote drugs, and make sure patients' interests come first. \"We recognise that we have an important role to play in providing doctors with information about our medicines, but this must be done clearly, transparently and without any perception of conflict of interest,\" he said. In 2012, GSK paid a record $3bn (\u00a31.9bn) in fines to settle claims that it tricked and bribed US doctors into prescribing children dangerous antidepressants.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The upmarket estate agent Savills has awarded its boss a 44% pay rise, in another sign of London's runaway property market. Jeremy Helsby, group chief executive, earned \u00a32.6m in pay and perks for 2013, compared with \u00a31.8m the previous year. Helsby, who joined the estate agent in 1980, saw his basic salary unchanged at \u00a3225,000, but gains a \u00a3610,000 windfall in shares, available from May, as well as a \u00a3363,000 increase in cash and shares under the company profits-sharing scheme. Chief financial officer Simon Shaw is in line for the same increase, taking his overall reward to \u00a31.9m. In its annual report published on Monday Savills said it had \"an exceptionally strong finish to the year including a record performance in the UK\", where revenues were up 16%, and underlying profits jumped 26% to \u00a355m. The firm's 26,000 staff will share in a bumper bonus pot of \u00a3169m, compared with \u00a3138m last year. The estate agent has a strong foothold in the prime London market, where its average selling price is \u00a33.2m. Savills' robust performance in central London, where volumes increased 13% year-on-year, reinforces data from the country's biggest building society Nationwide last week, which showed that house prices in the capital have increased by almost a fifth over the past 12 months, and are now 20% above their pre-crisis peak. Responding to fears of a housing bubble, the chancellor, George Osborne, said the government and regulators would have to remain vigilant. Savills also noted the London effect was spreading to \"prime commuter zones\" such as Cambridge, Oxford and Winchester, which have seen average price rises of 10% in the last year. But despite the boom, overall sales volumes still remain 15% below the 2007 peak in the capital, and 26% outside London. Estate agency and property development groups have enjoyed boom-like conditions over the past year, with the government's Help to Buy and Funding for Lending re-igniting the market. London\u2013focused estate agency Foxtons raised \u00a3390m on its stock market flotation last September, since when it has seen its shares jump from 267p to 366p. Its first set of results in March this year revealed first-half profits ahead 56% to \u00a339m. In February Countrywide, the estate agency with 380 branches under a variety of brands including Hamptons and John D Wood, said its operating profit was up 234% to \u00a356m. Shares in Savills have doubled over the past two years, climbing from around 300p to close at 665p yesterday. Building firms have shared in the profits bonanza. Barratt Developments recently revealed a 162% leap in profits, while Persimmon, Taylor Wimpey and Redrow have all reported bumper figures. The property boom, at least in the London area, is also pushing wages for bricklayers above \u00a3100,000 a year, according to a report by consultancy EC Harris, after a \"brawn drain\" of labourers during the recession has left the capital with a shortage of skilled workers.",

Worries about global growth after the World Bank edged down its growth forecasts for China, concerns about the tensions in Ukraine, and fears of a technology stock bubble, all combined to get the week off to a negative start: \u2022 The FTSE 100 finished 72.71 points or 1.09% lower at 6672.84 \u2022 Germany's Dax was down 1.91% to 9510.85 \u2022 France's Cac closed 1.08% lower at 4436.08 \u2022 Italy's FTSE MIB ended 0.84% down at 21,988.34 \u2022 Spain's Ibex fell 0.66% to 10,606.2 On Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently 113 points or 0.69% lower. And on that note, it's time to close up for the evening. Thanks for all the comments and we'll be back tomorrow. Mike Ashley, founder of Sports Direct, is rarely out of the headlines, and here he is again. A matter of days after shareholders in the retail group rejected a new bonus scheme for him, he has sold around \u00a3200m worth of shares in the business. The 4% stake was sold to Goldman Sachs, which is offering them to institutional investors at between 850p and 870p according to Reuters. It comes as he was revealed to have bought a stake in House of Fraser amid a proposed Chinese takeover of the department store group. Back to the first story of the morning, the World Bank's latest forecasts for Asia and the Pacific. Kamel Mellahi, Professor of Strategic Management at Warwick Business School, has warned that the Chinese faces a bumpy ride for \"years to come\" , as Beijing tries to restructure and rebalance its economy. Professor Mellahi said: \"As expected the restructuring strategy launched last year is having an effect, and slower economic growth is one of its side effects. The target is not expected to be missed by much but the timing is important \u2013 understandably the new government in China is very keen on hitting the growth target on its first year in government. It is doing all it can to avoid missing the growth target. \"The stimulus measures unveiled last week were aimed primarily at shoring up economic growth in the short-term, but long-term economic growth will hinge on the success of the restructuring plan.\u201d Over in Greece, the prime minister has announced a scheme to deal with Greece's backlog of unpaid VAT bills, in a bid to get the economic wheels grinding a little faster. The eKathimerini newspaper has the details: Prime Minister Antonis Samaras announced on Monday the launch of a scheme that will companies to offset the VAT they owe the state against the returns the state owes them. The option will also be open to firms to use in the debts they owe to each other, meaning they would subtract the VAT from the total owed. Samaras said that fines imposed on businesses that are unable to pay their taxes because the state has not returned their VAT would be scrapped. \u201cThe state cannot be strict on citizens if it is not fair to citizens,\u201d he said. After that early wobble, the Nasdaq index has clawed its way into the green, up just 0.14%. Shares in Yahoo! dived another 2.5%, but recovered some ground to around $33.8, or 1.1% lower. Pharmaceuticals firm Questcor is one of the biggest risers, up 21% following the $5.6bn takeover deal launched by Mallinckrodt (see earlier) Wall Street is open...and the main indices are falling, adding to last Friday's losses. The Dow Jones industrial average is down 35 points, or 0.22%, to 16377. And the tech-heavy Nasdaq, which shed 2% at the end of last week, is down another 0.5% in early trading. Details to follow.... In the UK, the prime minister has hot-footed it to an Asda store to celebrate the news it is creating 12,000 new jobs across the UK over the next five years. David Cameron (criticised for gushing about Waitrose last week) said he was \"delighted\" by the news, which would give people \"financial security for the future.\" The PM also showed his softer side, posing with a customer's baby for a photo, as the Press Association reports: Cameron joked that it made him \"broody\" as he held the 11-month-old, who gently tapped the PM on the head with an Easter bunny balloon. Honestly, young people have all the fun. More here: David Cameron 'delighted' at Asda plans to create 12,000 new jobs The Russian stock market has taken a tumble today, as the political and military crisis in Ukraine flared up again. The MICEX index has fallen by 3% today. Dixy Group, Russia's third-largest food retailer, shed 8.5%. The selloff was fuelled by news that pro-Russian activists in the eastern Ukrainian city of Donetsk has occupied a government building and declared independence from Kiev. They are now calling for a referendum on whether \"Donetsk Republic\" should break away from Ukraine. Ukraine: pro-Russia activists proclaim independent republic in Donetsk Separately, a Russian soldier repordetly shot dead a Ukrainian naval officer in eastern Crimea on Sunday. And Russia's Gazprom says Ukraine has not met a deadline to pay a $2.2bn bill for gas supplies, with Kiev refusing to pay new, higher, prices. The flurry of M&amp;A activity continues, with a \u00a33.4bn pharmaceutical deal being announced. Drugmaker Mallinckrodt is paying $5.6bn in cash and shares for its Questcor, which makes treatments for autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. Full statement here. Deals are in the air at present -- this morning, Holcim and Lafarge agrees to merge and create the world's biggest cement maker. Clang! Bundesbank president Jens Weidmann has made some hawkish comments that undermine the notion that the European Central Bank is totally committed to taking whatever unconventional measures are needed. Germany's central bank chief told an audience in Frankfurt that monetary policy cannot solve the financial crisis. Unlike Yves Mersch today, and Mario Draghi last week, Weidmann didn't make any reference to quantitative easing (QE). Instead, he cautioned against overstretching the ECB, saying: \"Overburdening monetary policy is of course anathema to the Bundesbank.\" He also called for eurozone politicians to keep reforming their economies. Reuters has the details: Weidmann argued that to strengthen the stability of Europe's monetary union, stiffened fiscal rules should be applied more consistently and \"preferential\" treatment accorded to sovereign debt - treated by European regulators as risk-free - should be ended. \"Overcoming the crisis is still an uphill struggle; if you don't go forwards, you go backwards,\" he added.\"With regard to reforms, governments therefore have to keep the pedal to the metal. In footballing terms, I would say 'the half-time whistle has blown'. However, there is no time for a break.\" Leading ECB analyst Lorcan Roche Kelly of Agenda Research flashes Weidmann a yellow card: Here's more reaction to Yves Mersch's comments about how the ECB is drawing up a QE programme, just in case... A top European Central Bank policymaker has confirmed that the ECB is working on a large asset-purchase scheme to drive inflation higher, as Mario Draghi revealed last week. But Yves Mersch also argued that this QE programme isn't required yet. He said: The inflation and deflation risks are more or less level in EMU area which means that we do not see an imminent risk of deflation. However, we are ready to prepare for such a situation. The turmoil at Co-op Bank deepens - it has just announced that might not release its (already delayed) financial results for 2013 until Friday. City editor Jill Treanor reports: The figures have already been postponed from 26 March after the bank stunned the City by admitting last month that it needed another \u00a3400m on top of a \u00a31.5bn cash injection at the end of last year. When it first postponed the results, the bank\u2019s new boss Niall Booker said he aimed to publish the numbers \u201con or before\u201d 8 April but this rapidly approaching deadline has proved to be too challenging. Here's the full story: Co-op Bank delays issuing results again This chart, from the NAO's report into Royal Mail, may be mentioned when the Business Committee quizzes Vince Cable on April 29th: Back to the World Bank report on Asia (see opening post onwards). Tom Rafferty, China Analyst at The Economist Intelligence Unit, fears the Bank is too optimistic by forecasting growth of 7.6% in China this year. He doesn't believe Beijing will provide enough economic stimulus to even hit its own target of 7.5%: Rafferty says: The Chinese government has announced some modest pro-growth measures in recent weeks but, given challenging macro-economic conditions, it will require much more stimulus if the economy is to expand by 7.6% this year. However, a significant loosening of monetary or fiscal policy would compromise the reform agenda that the World Bank also praises in its report. The Economist Intelligence Unit expects growth of 7.3% in 2014, marginally undershooting the official target of 7.5%.\u201d Business secretary Vince Cable is being recalled before the Business Select Committee to answer more questions about the privatisation of Royal Mail. The committee will hear from Cable, and business minister Michael Fallon, on April 29th. This follows the National Audit Office's report, which found that the taxpayer missed out on \u00a3750m in potential revenue because the government was too \"cautious\" over the float. The NAO also exposed how many of the City investors who were favoured in the share allocation process broke their \"gentleman's agreement\" and sold their stakes soon after the IPO. This is the committee's second chance to gnaw the government over the issue. Back in November, Cable and Fallon insisted that they had got a good price for Royal Mail (despite its share promptly soaring 70%), and denied botching the float. Cable stuck to his guns in parliament last week - so will this latest hearing shed any more light?. Some observers fear not... Eurozone investor confidence has hit a three year high, but they've become less optimistic about Germany's future prospects, according to data firm Sentix today Sentix's monthly sentiment index rose in April to 14.1, up from 13.9 in March, to its highest level since April 2011. But its expectations measure fell for the second month running, from 23.5 to 22.8, pushed down by less bullishness about the German economy. Dr Sebastian Wanke, senior analyst at Sentix, says the driving forces in the eurozone have changed as Germany \"loses steam\". Since the beginning of the debt crisis in 2009, Germany has been the growth engine for the euro zone. Now, the sentix economic index for Germany falls for the third time in a row while the index for the euro area manages to, once again, rise slightly to 14.1 points from 13.9. This shows that a change of economic driving forces is under way in the euro area. Sentix's composite index for Germany fell for a third time in a row in April, to 28.9 from 30.7 in March. Six-month-expectations decreased significantly, while the assessment of the current situation is no longer improving. Quite at odds with the latest German industrial production data, showing a healthy pick-up in orders in February (see previous post). Sentix also reported that investors remain fearful of eurozone deflation, but weren't quite as alarmed as in February and November. Wanke said: Furthermore, fears of deflation persist. Mario Draghi, president of the European Central Bank, has even focused on them during his press conference last week. The full report is online here. Industrial production in Germany and Spain rose in February, in an encouraging signal for the eurozone economy. German industrial output rose by 0.4% in February, leading its Economy Ministry to predict that growth over the first three months of 2014 will be \"appreciably above\" the fourth quarter performance. And ING's Carsten Brzeski declared that: The German economy is powering ahead. Spain's data beat forecasts, with industrial output jumping by 2.8% year-on-year in February (analysts expected a 1.7% rise). That's the fourth monthly increase in a row. Victor Echevarria, an economist at BNP Paribas, said this is \"hard\" evidence that Spain's economy is clawing its way back, after the jobless total fell by 16,600 in March. \"Up until now for the first quarter all we've seen have been very strong confidence numbers, but the industrial output data, together with employment figures last week, show this is translating in to stronger hard data,\" (quote via Reuters) The eurozone bond party keeps rolling this morning, with Italian and Spanish sovereign debt rising in value again. This pushed down the yield on Italian 10-year bonds to a fresh eurozone-era record low of just 3.17%. Peripheral eurozone debt has benefitted from optimism that the eurozone crisis is over, and weak inflation across the region. The news that the European Central Bank discussed quantitative easing at last week's meeting has also driven demand. Smaller tech stocks are also sliding in London this morning. Semiconductor firms Imagination Technologies (down 4.1%) and CSR (down 3.6%) are leading the way, with setbox maker Pace losing 3.4%. Last Friday's Nasdaq selloff has left investors nervous that the tech sector is heading for a fall, after rallying sharply for months. Various Asian social media companies also fell sharply earlier today (fastFT has a good round-up) Chris Weston of IG summed the situation up: There seems to be some rotation out of any names which have effectively been labelled a \u2018bubble\u2019 over the last six months or so and there seems to be some money being re-positioned into names which have been returning cash to shareholders. The biggest fallers in London this morning includes housebuilders (Barratt and Persimmon), retailers (Marks &amp; Spencer and Burberry) and tech stocks (ARM and Just Eat, which provides IT for online takeaways and floated last week). European stock markets have fallen across the board in early trading, with the main indices losing as much as 1.5%. Investors are reacting to Friday night's Wall Street selloff (which saw 2% wiped off the Nasdaq index as tech and biotech shares tumbled). All but four shares on the FTSE 100 are in the red in London -- no major fallers, just a steady decline. FTSE 100: down 47 points at 6647, -0.7% German DAX: down 141 points at 9554, -1.5% French CAC: down 40 points at 4443, -0.9% Spanish IBEX: down 108 points at 10569, -1% Italian FTSE MIB: down 308 points at 21866, - 1.4% The drop is being partly blamed on last Friday's US jobs report. March's non-farm payrolls showed 192,000 new jobs were created, a bit below forecast, and no increase in hourly pay. That's not expected to stop the Federal Reserve cutting its QE programme, though: CMC's Michael Hewson comments: It would appear that a number of investors had been pricing in the prospect of a jobs number in excess of 200k as the week had progressed, ignoring the possibility that maybe the type of jobs rebound they had been hoping for might well be a bit premature. The report also highlights that the East Asia and Pacific region has been the fastest-growing part of the world economy for most of the last decade: Today's report also shows how East Asian economies suffered slower growth rates in 2013, due to economic weakness at home and abroad. Sources of growth shifted from domestic demand during the first two quarters to net exports in the second half. Efforts to unwind domestic imbalances and tighten policies contributed to a sharp decline in economic activity in the first half of the year. Investment weakened during the adjustment process, dragging down capital goods imports. Consumption came under pressure from fiscal consolidation efforts, including the expiry of previous consumer support programs and the rationalization of fuel subsidies. Growth lost further impetus from tepid external demand from the advanced economies and a slowdown in China, which hurt manufactured and commodity exports. On Thailand, the World Bank warns that the months of demonstrations by pro and anti-government supporters put the country in a precarious state. The political gridlock means that important projects that are crucial to growth prospects simply aren't getting approved, amplifying the risks of a sharper slowdown in China. The World Bank said: The most immediate risks to Thailand\u2019s future growth are the pace of recovery of the global economy and the political situation. A slower-than-expected recovery in the global economy and a faster slowdown in the Chinese economy will have a negative impact on Thai exports. The political gridlock has already led to deteriorating confidence and difficulty in routine tasks such as passport issuance. Delays in the long-awaited large public infrastructure projects will affect growth not only this year but also in the long run, since better water management and logistics improvements are crucial for Thailand\u2019s future growth. Moreover, continued political instability have been distracting governments from focusing on long-term development issues such as improving skills and competitiveness. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of events across the financial markets, the global economy, the eurozone and business. The World Bank has kicked off the week by cutting its growth forecasts for the Asian economy, including a sharp downgrade to Thailand following months of political unrest. It warned that \"there was a bumpy start to 2014, notably in China and the United States\", as it lowered its forecast for growth across the East Asia and Pacific region. It now expects GDP to rise by 7.1% in 2014 and 2015 across the area, down from the 7.2% previously forecast for both years. And it admitted that this could be too optimistic, given the wider economic risks. Bert Hofman, chief economist of the World Bank\u2019s East Asia and Pacific Region, cited three key threats: \u201cA slower-than-expected recovery in advanced economies, a rise in global interest rates, and increased volatility in commodity prices on account of recent geo-political tensions in Eastern Europe serve as reminders that East Asia remains vulnerable to adverse global developments.\" Although it still expects \"stable economic growth\" across the region, the World Bank warns that growth will \"ease moderately\" in most of Asia's larger economies this year. That includes the regional powerhouse; China's growth rate in 2014 has been trimmed from 7.7% to 7.6%. The Bank warned that the Chinese economy had made a shaky start to the year, but should now find its footing. While China's growth rate of industrial production has slowed, and exports contracted in the first two months of 2014, the trend is nevertheless strengthening, and we expect quarterly growth to rise at midyear as external demand from the high-income countries solidifies. The World Bank said it was encouraged by the financial markets' \"modest response so far\" to the Federal Reserve\u2019s tapering of its bond-buying stimulus programme. But it was particularly critical of the situation in Thailand, where anti-government protestors have been demanding the resignation of prime minister Yingluck Shinawatra for several months. The World Bank slashed its forecast for Thai economic growth this year, from +4.5% to just +3%, warning that the political instability was hurting its economy badly, and making it hard for the state to function. It added: Tourism receipts, public investment, and investor confidence are all also affected [by the protests]. So, a downbeat start to a busy week, which will climax with the IMF and World Bank's Spring meeting in Washington on Friday. And with European stock markets expected to fall today, after Wall Street's selloff late last week, it could be a nervy day. I'll be tracking all the key events through the day....",

      "bodyText": "The City regulator could be heading for another bruising battle with the financial services industry after uncovering evidence that most firms offering investment advice are not being clear about their fees, and some may even be misleading consumers. With controversy still raging over the botched announcement of its investigation into the insurance sector, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has turned its fire on financial advisers. It said it had uncovered what appeared to be widespread failings in the way firms selling investments, pensions and other products disclosed information on their costs and services. An official ban on commission paid to financial advisers came into force at the end of 2012, with firms and individuals forced to charge a fee for their services rather than hiding costs in a product's charges. The changes have prompted many banks to exit the advice market, either partially or fully, thereby creating what some have dubbed an \"advice gap\" for mainstream consumers. The FCA surveyed 113 firms \u2013 including banks, small and large financial advisers, and wealth management firms \u2013 to see how they had implemented these so-called disclosure rules, and said it had found that \"too many\" were not being clear with consumers. The FCA found 73% of firms had failed to provide the required information on the cost of advice. For example, 58% failed to give customers clear, upfront general information on how much their advice might cost, while more than a third either failed to provide a clear explanation of the service they offer in return for an ongoing fee, or failed to properly outline the customer's cancellation rights. The regulator revealed that two unnamed companies \u2013 a financial adviser and a wealth manager \u2013 could face punishment. These firms, whose failings were particularly serious, are likely to be referred to the regulator's enforcement and financial crime division. Last month Santander was fined \u00a312.4m by the FCA for serious failings in the way it sold thousands of customers' investment products. The regulator said it had found a significant risk that the bank was giving unsuitable advice to consumers, and that its approach to assessing people's appetite for risk was inadequate. However, the latest announcement contained some good news for Britain's banks, building societies and life insurers: the FCA said the firms in these categories that it had looked at had complied with the \"vast majority\" of the disclosure rules. An FCA spokesman said: \"We are concerned that the extent of these failings may lead to poor outcomes for consumers \u2026 the failings identified in the FCA's review suggest some consumers could be unaware of, or even misled in relation to: the cost of advice; the type of service offered by a firm; the nature of a firm's restriction; or the service they can expect to receive in return for the ongoing fee.\" He added: \"While failings appear widespread across the industry, wealth managers and private banks performed poorer than other firms in nearly all aspects.\" Clive Adamson, director of supervision at the FCA, said the new regime on fees and charges was aimed at ensuring that consumers had the information they needed to make informed decisions, and were clear on the costs and services they were being offered. \"While we have seen a lot of positive progress and willingness by advisers to adapt to the new environment, I am disappointed with the results of our latest review looking at whether advisers are clear with their customers on costs and services provided \u2026 These results are a wake-up call and we expect the industry to respond,\" he added.",

      "bodyText": "Leading shares in London suffered their biggest one day fall in a month, following a late slump on Wall Street on Friday which continued around the world as the new week began. With Asian markets sharply lower and the Dow Jones Industrial Average continuing its decline in early trading - down 101 points by the time London closed - the FTSE 100 finished at 6622.84, a 72.71 point fall which was its worst daily performance since 7 March. Worries about global growth as the World Bank edged down its forecasts for China, combined with concerns about further tension in Ukraine to unsettle investors. Recent sharp rises in technology stocks finally prompted worries that a bubble had developed, leading to a bout of profit taking in the sector. Rebecca O'Keeffe at Interactive Investor said: Technology and biotech shares have been under pressure in recent weeks, but Friday's rout was the most pronounced sign yet that investors are becoming increasingly nervous the sector has been overbought. Earnings season kicks off in the US [on Tuesday] and investors will be hoping for robust gains in profitability in order to justify the market's elevated valuations. If company results disappoint, this could have a dramatic impact on investor sentiment and see the start of a sharp sell-off. So Arm was down 23.5p to 972.5p despite a positive note from UBS, Imagination Technologies fell 12.1p to 202.6p, CSR closed 22.5p lower at 667.5p, Pace was down 5.4p at 444.6p, Ocado lost 30.2p to 422p and Asos slumped 343p to \u00a346.17. Two recently floated online businesses also fell back. JustEat dropped 26.75p to 264p and AO World lost 15p to 295p, even though analysts at Jefferies were positive on the latter: AO sells white goods online in the United Kingdom. It has scale (2013 revenue \u00a3276m), a high-growth dynamic (2009/13 revenue compound annual growth rate of 32.6%) and a very impressive senior management team. Medium-term catalysts for incremental growth come from [expansion into] TV and Germany and near term we see the trading update, national TV ad campaign and FTSE 250 inclusion as positives. Initiate with a buy recommendation, price target 410p. Housebuilders also subsided, amid concerns the property market is overvalued and could be in for a correction. Barratt Developments dropped 20.5p to 389.4p, Persimmon fell 54p to \u00a312.92 and Redrow lost 15.4p to 301p. There were also concerns about the impact on cement prices of a proposed $44bn merger between Swiss cement maker Holcim and French rival Lafarge. Building materials group CRH lost earlier gains to close down 15p at \u00a317.60. CRH was tipped as a possible buyer since the merged group is likely to have to sell subsidiaries to meet competition concerns. News that India's Sun Pharmaceuticals had agreed to buy rival Ranbaxy for $3.2bn did not help pharmaceuticals groups in the UK. GlaxoSmithKline was down 23p to \u00a315.54 amid reports of possible irregularities in Iraq, while AstraZeneca fell 55.5p to 3867.5p. But Savvas Neophytou at Panmure Gordon saw positive signs for AstraZeneca from the proposed deal: Ranbaxy's capitulation implies, in our view, that its manufacturing woes were deeper than had previously been expected.

Elsewhere utilities reverted to their safe haven status, with Centrica climbing 6.3p to 334.8p, BG adding 5.5p to 1141.5p and SSE rising 7p to \u00a314.82.

      "bodyText": "The Co-operative Bank was thrown into fresh turmoil on Monday as it delayed the publication of its 2013 financial results, and the pay deal for its new boss, for a second time. The figures had already been postponed from 26 March after the bank stunned the City by admitting last month that it needed a further \u00a3400m on top of a \u00a31.5bn cash injection at the end of last year. When it first delayed the results, the bank's new boss, Niall Booker, said he aimed to publish the numbers \"on or before\" 8 April, but this rapidly approaching deadline has proved too challenging. In a brief statement, the bank said it will now publish its annual report and accounts no later than Friday. It gave no explanation for the delay other than to say that would enable it to finalise its accounts. The bank \u2013 now just 30% owned by the Co-operative Group of supermarkets, funeral homes and pharmacies \u2013 has already admitted that its losses for 2013 could reach \u00a31.3bn. But publication of the annual report will provide the detail and information about the pay of Booker, who was hired to oversee the bank at the time the \u00a31.5bn capital shortfall was uncovered in May last year. The veteran banker, who has already axed 1,000 jobs from the bank, was a key player in the team assembled by Euan Sutherland before he quit last month as chief executive of the Co-op Group. Sutherland walked out after his \u00a36.6m two-year pay deal was leaked to the Observer along with details of retention packages for his team at the group. When asked if he and his team at the bank are on similar retention packages to those of Sutherland, Booker deferred his response until the release of the annual report. The problems at the bank are feeding into the group, which is on course to report losses of at least \u00a32bn next week and is struggling to win support for proposals drawn up by Lord Myners to overhaul the way it is run. The seven regional boards that control 78% of the power at the group met over the weekend to express their concerns to representatives from London Business School who are helping Myners \u2013 the only non-executive director on the board \u2013 create a boardroom more akin to a public company. Members of the regional boards are thought to be considering writing to the group chair, Ursula Lidbetter, to express their concerns about the reforms, which will be put to a vote in the summer. It is not yet clear if they will be put to a vote at the annual meeting on 17 May, although those attending are able to table resolutions. The regional boards are scheduled to meet again before the meeting, when Sir Christopher Kelly has said he will present the findings of his review into what went wrong at the bank. Myners will publish a fuller version of his ideas before then. Another idea that has been considered is to hold member meetings in Manchester and London before the annual meeting to discuss the Myners principles.",
