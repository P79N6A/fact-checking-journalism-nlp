    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Former BHS employees will have to wait years to find out whether their pension scheme will be bailed out by Sir Philip Green, experts have warned, after the Pensions Regulator begun formal legal proceedings against the billionaire tycoon. The regulator took the dramatic step of starting enforcement action this week after failing to agree a deal with Green to inject cash into the BHS pension scheme, which has a \u00a3571m pension deficit. John Ralfe, a pensions expert, said Green and the Pensions Regulator now faced a \u201clong war of attrition\u201d and warned it will take years to resolve the standoff. The regulator can legally demand Green makes a payment, but the tycoon can appeal against their decision all the way to the supreme court. \u201cThis is very significant, very rare, and there aren\u2019t any precedents,\u201d Ralfe said. \u201cIt will take years. It\u2019s going to be a long war of attrition.\u201d The move also increases the chances of Green losing his knighthood, following a symbolic vote in parliament last month when MPs demanded the businessman be stripped of his honour. It is understood that the regulator quickly turned down an offer by Green because the lump sum he proposed was too low, while the structure he suggested was seen as risky and left too much uncertainty for pension fund members. The regulator has not disclosed how much it is seeking from Green, but it is thought to be around \u00a3300m and the tycoon\u2019s offer was at least \u00a350m short. But the structure of the deal is also important. It is understood that Green\u2019s offer involved buying out pensioners with small savings pots and then setting up a new fund for those who want to remain in a BHS pension scheme. The new scheme would not have a sponsoring company to secure it, which runs contrary to Pension Protection Fund guidelines. The BHS pension scheme is currently in an assessment period with the PPF. If a deal or settlement with Green cannot be reached the scheme will eventually enter the PPF, where the 20,000 members will suffer a cut to their benefits of at least 10%. Ralfe defended the regulator for beginning enforcement action and said it was right to reject complex financial arrangements for bailing out pension schemes. \u201cYou can\u2019t make things up on the hoof, it\u2019s a nonsense,\u201d he said. Ros Altmann, the former pensions minister, added: \u201cYou don\u2019t tell regulators what you believe is the right amount \u2013 they tell you. \u201cIf I were Sir Philip, I would take back responsibility for the BHS scheme and manage it on an ongoing basis to find the best way to meet the liabilities over time. But that will be expensive. \u201cThis is what he promised parliament he would do. Putting in a smaller amount than the regulator requires will just mean members stay in the PPF and any extra money goes into the central PPF pot. To pay better benefits will require a bigger amount of money, but it is up to the regulator to decide what that amount should be.\u201d The PPF, which is funded by a levy charged to company pension schemes, backed the regulator\u2019s announcement. Alan Rubenstein, chief executive of the PPF, said: \u201cWe welcome any steps that may secure more money for the BHS pension schemes. This would reduce the cost falling on our levy payers and may provide the potential for members to receive higher than PPF levels of benefits. \u201cMembers of the BHS pension schemes continue to be protected by the PPF and can be assured that regardless of the current shortfall in the schemes they can expect to receive PPF level benefits.\u201d BHS collapsed into administration in April, leading to the loss of 11,000 jobs and leaving a pension deficit of \u00a3571m. Green controlled BHS between 2000 and 2015, during which time his family and other shareholders collected more than \u00a3580m. In March 2015, Green sold BHS to Dominic Chappell, a serial bankrupt with no retail experience, for just \u00a31. Chappell\u2019s company Retail Acquisitions collected an estimated \u00a317m from BHS despite owning it for just 13 months until it fell into administration. The regulator said it had sent warning notices to Green, Chappell and their companies, Taveta and Retail Acquisitions. The warning notices run to more than 300 pages and explain why the regulator believes the parties are liable to financially support the BHS pension scheme. Green and Chappell now have around six months to reply to the regulator and set out their case. When they do, a Pensions Regulator determinations panel \u2013 which is independent of the investigations team \u2013 will rule whether the parties involved should make a one-off payment into the pension scheme, provide on-going financial support, or both. However, this decision can then be appealed. The regulator has said it is still open to reaching a settlement with Green. The cash sum the regulator is seeking to redress the BHS pension scheme dwarfs its previous settlements. Since the Pensions Regulator was founded in 2005 it has only issued warning notices in 16 cases and completed 10 of those. It has raised \u00a3400m for pension schemes, including through out-of-court settlements. A similar case to BHS involving Coats Group, a thread manufacturer, has not evolved beyond the warning notice stage despite these being issued three years ago. Green insists he made a \u201ccredible and substantial proposal\u201d to the regulator, despite the regulator saying it was yet to receive a \u201csufficiently credible and comprehensive offer\u201d. A source close to the tycoon said: \u201cThere was a substantial amount of money on the table that would have improved the position of BHS pensioners.\u201d The warning notices sent to Green and Chappell are different, although the regulator declined to provide further details. Chappell said: \u201cThere is a huge bundle of documents that we need to read through carefully. When we are ready to make a statement, we will.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "What a surprise, the great British consumer did not retreat into a bunker after the vote for Brexit in June. He and she kept on eating, drinking and buying houses as if nothing of great significance had happened. \u201cFor households, the signs of an economic slowdown are notable by their absence,\u201d admitted governor Mark Carney, struggling to explain why the Bank of England\u2019s forecast in August that short-term growth in the UK economy would come to a near standstill was wrong by an embarrassing margin. Sympathy for the forecasters should be limited. It is true that referendums, especially ones that lead to the defenestration of a prime minister, don\u2019t happen often. But, come on, it was hardly fanciful to think consumers might disregard, for a while, the dangers of an actual exit from the European Union if the event was pencilled in to happen only in 2019. Real incomes are still rising (for now) and experience suggests UK consumers tend to stay on the dancefloor until the music stops. Such behaviour is possibly imprudent in the face of a 20% fall in the exchange rate but most Britons, unlike Bank officials, do not spend their days modelling inflationary pass-through effects. Indeed, for homeowners with variable-rate mortgages, the first direct financial impact of the referendum was a small reduction in monthly payments after the quarter-point cut in Bank rate in August. Carney and co can take some small credit for a successful intervention but their short-term forecasting misjudgment remains severe. Wisely, the governor did not claim to have saved the nation from the gloom he predicted. The positives \u201care neither solely due, nor totally unrelated to\u201d the Bank\u2019s actions, was as far as he dared fudge it. If Threadneedle Street couldn\u2019t tell what lay around the next corner, should we trust its projections for 2017 and 2018? Actually, yes, we should. Those inflation models aren\u2019t perfect but it\u2019s not hard to predict what will happen when the pound is down by a fifth. Prices will rise.

Pension Regulator\u2019s patience finally snaps So much for \u201cthe light in the tunnel\u201d that Sir Philip Green claimed to spot as long ago as June in his negotiations with the Pensions Regulator over the deficit in the BHS fund.

Now it has snapped. The regulator has launched formal legal proceedings against Green (plus a company controlled by his wife, and also against Dominic Chappell, the former bankrupt whose outfit bought BHS for \u00a31). Green suggests he can\u2019t understand the fuss. He says he\u2019s put forward \u201ca credible and substantial proposal, with evidence and bank confirmation of cash availability\u201d. The Topshop tycoon seems to have misunderstood how the process works. It is not for him to decide what counts as credible and substantial \u2013 that\u2019s the regulator\u2019s role. As far as we can tell, the dispute involves fundamental questions, like the size of the initial lump sum to cover the deficit. If so, the regulator is right to issue warning notices. Green first started talking about his plan to \u201csort\u201d the deficit back in 2014 when he (or, rather, his Monaco-based wife) still owned BHS. The farce has run too long already.

FCA picks up baton dropped by CMA The Competition and Markets Authority\u2019s proposals to enliven the banking sector were feeble, almost everybody agrees (apart from the report\u2019s authors, of course). Now, even the Financial Conduct Authority seems to have sided with the doubters. The City regulator will study whether it should impose a cap on overdraft fees, an idea the CMA rejected in its summer report. The two bodies perform different roles, so all sides can pretend politely that there is no fundamental disagreement. But, as the watchful Treasury select committee chair Andrew Tyrie says, it looks as if the FCA is picking up a baton dropped by the CMA. Indeed, the FCA\u2019s inquiry could quickly become a wider review of where else the CMA failed. That would be very welcome.",

He and she kept on eating, drinking and buying houses as if nothing of great significance had happened. \u201cFor households, the signs of an economic slowdown are notable by their absence,\u201d admitted governor Mark Carney, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/nov/03/bank-of-england-rate-cuts-2017-growth-forecast-inflation\">struggling to explain</a> why the Bank of England\u2019s forecast in August that short-term growth in the UK economy would come to a near standstill was wrong by an embarrassing margin.</p> <p>Sympathy for the forecasters should be limited. It is true that referendums, especially ones that lead to the defenestration of a prime minister, don\u2019t happen often. But, come on, it was hardly fanciful to think consumers might disregard, for a while, the dangers of an actual exit from the European Union if the event was pencilled in to happen only in 2019.</p> <p>Real incomes are still rising (for now) and experience suggests UK consumers tend to stay on the dancefloor until the music stops. Such behaviour is possibly imprudent in the face of a 20% fall in the exchange rate but most Britons, unlike Bank officials, do not spend their days modelling inflationary pass-through effects.</p> <p>Indeed, for homeowners with variable-rate mortgages, the first direct financial impact of the referendum was a small reduction in monthly payments after the quarter-point cut in Bank rate in August. Carney and co can take some small credit for a successful intervention but their short-term forecasting misjudgment remains severe. Wisely, the governor did not claim to have saved the nation from the gloom he predicted. The positives \u201care neither solely due, nor totally unrelated to\u201d the Bank\u2019s actions, was as far as he dared fudge it.</p> <p>If Threadneedle Street couldn\u2019t tell what lay around the next corner, should we trust its projections for 2017 and 2018? Actually, yes, we should. Those inflation models aren\u2019t perfect but it\u2019s not hard to predict what will happen when the pound is down by a fifth. Prices will rise.

      "bodyText": "Tata is preparing to make a decision about the future of the Port Talbot steelworks within four weeks after the Indian conglomerate forced out its boss, with the company edging towards keeping its UK operations. Ratan Tata, the interim chairman who took over from Cyrus Mistry this month, is understood to be conducting a detailed review of Tata Steel UK before making a final decision. However, the Tata family scion, who oversaw the Indian company\u2019s acquisition of Corus for \u00a36.2bn in 2007, is keen to keep the UK steel operations. The future of Tata Steel UK and its 11,000 workers have been in doubt since its Indian owner announced in March it was reviewing the future of the business. Tata then revealed in July it was in negotiations with German company ThyssenKrupp about merging their European steel operations, with the UK business set to be included in the deal if an agreement could be reached with the government to restructure its pension scheme. But UK steelworkers faced further uncertainty last week when Mistry \u2013 who had driven the talks with ThyssenKrupp \u2013 was ousted as chairman of Tata. However, one Tata source said this was positive news for the UK and that Ratan Tata would now commit to turning around its steel operations. They said Ratan Tata was analysing whether to go ahead with the ThyssenKrupp deal and proposals to sell Tata Steel\u2019s speciality steel arm, which employs 2,000 people in north-east England, before announcing his plan for the business. \u201cThey will urgently make a decision, but whatever happens Tata will stay [in the UK steel business],\u201d the source said. \u201cRatan Tata will go through in detail and analyse.\u201d Ratan Tata was chairman of the company for more than two decades before standing aside for Mistry in 2012. He is a renowned anglophile and made a string of acquisitions in the UK, including Jaguar Land Rover, Tetley tea, and Corus, which was previously known as British steel. The board of Tata deposed Mistry for several reasons \u2013 including a clash of cultures \u2013 but it was further unsettled by his plan to offload all or part of the UK steel business. The company has a reputation in India for its long-term approach and commitment to supporting communities. Ratan Tata is due to act as interim chairman for four months. However, the permanent replacement for Mistry is almost certain to be supportive of Ratan Tata\u2019s approach, given his influence. Theresa May, the UK prime minister, is leading a trade delegation to India next week, although it is unclear whether she will meet Tata representatives. A government spokesperson said: \u201cA great deal of work has been done to support the steel industry, including tackling the dumping of cheap imports into the EU and introducing guidelines so that, wherever possible, UK steel is used in government projects. \u201cThe recent reopening of the plate mills in Scotland and British Steel taking over the Scunthorpe site and hiring more people shows the sector can remain competitive with the right investment.\u201d",

Unite, which has been pushing for an inquiry into the effects of cabin air on crew health, has been further concerned by BA referring internally to the incident as an \u201codour event\u201d. A BA flight was diverted to Vancouver on its way back to London from San Francisco on 25 October when 11 crew on the Airbus A380 reported feeling sick after inhaling fumes in the cabin. All 25 crew members were taken to hospital on landing as a precaution. Exchanges recorded between the plane and air traffic control show that the pilot sought permission to land because of a \u201cfume event\u201d, involving \u201ctoxic fumes, toxic gas-like fumes\u201d. A further incident briefly occurred the following day on another BA service, flight BA 269 from Heathrow to Los Angeles. Although the flight continued as normal, according to Unite, crew on the flight deck put on oxygen masks after becoming aware of fumes. Unite has been pressing for a public inquiry into cabin air quality and \u201caerotoxic syndrome\u201d. Neither the UK industry regulator, the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA), nor British Airways have recognised what campaigners believe to be a syndrome affecting plane crew who are exposed to air contaminated by organophosphates. The union\u2019s director of legal services, Howard Beckett, said: \u201cIt is clear from all the reports we\u2019ve received and the exchanges between the flight deck and air traffic control that the incident on board the diverted BA flight from San Francisco to London Heathrow was more serious than a mere \u2018odour event\u2019. \u201cDownplaying serious toxic fume events on board aircraft as \u2018odour events\u2019 smacks of spin and an attempt to manipulate official statistics to downplay how widespread the problem really is in the industry. \u201cFume events and continued exposure to contaminated cabin air can lead to serious ill health with long-term debilitating effects on people\u2019s wellbeing.\u201d The airline said the designation did not mean incidents were not reported, both by crew to the airline and then on to the CAA. A BA spokeswoman said: \u201cSafety is always our priority. There has been no change in the way in which we investigate reports of this nature. We continue to conduct thorough and detailed investigations which we share with the CAA. We always encourage our people to report any potential incident to allow us to investigate them.\u201d",

A BA spokeswoman said: \u201cSafety is always our priority. There has been no change in the way in which we investigate reports of this nature. We continue to conduct thorough and detailed investigations which we share with the CAA. We always encourage our people to report any potential incident to allow us to investigate them.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "The Bank of England has warned households to expect a sharp rise in inflation next year as the weak pound ramps up the costs of imports and squeezes family finances. Predicting rises in petrol prices and other goods that the UK buys in from abroad, the Bank said inflation would rise from 1.3% this year to 2.7% in 2017 and 2018, higher than in its last set of forecasts three months ago. In its new outlook, the monetary policy committee (MPC), led by the Bank\u2019s governor, Mark Carney, said it would take until 2020 for inflation to get back to the target of 2% set by the government. The new forecast was delivered as the Bank kept interest rates at a record low of 0.25% and dropped plans to cut them further in the near future, although the inflation warning was tempered with a projection that economic growth will be much stronger than previously forecast in the near-term. The pound tumbled to 30-year lows in the wake of the vote to leave the EU and has come under fresh pressure in recent weeks over investor fears that the UK is heading for a hard Brexit deal that would leave it shut out of Europe\u2019s single market. The sharp depreciation has made UK exports more competitive but imports more expensive \u2013 prompting changes to inflation forecasts. Carney, who has been forced to fend off criticism that he was overly gloomy on the potential blow to the economy from a leave vote, said on Thursday that sterling\u2019s sharp fall made the Bank\u2019s usual balancing act more challenging. He described the UK as facing \u201cexceptional circumstances\u201d and said the MPC was making a trade-off between keeping inflation in check and shoring up growth. For now, record-low interest rates and a big programme of electronic money printing, known as quantitative easing, was appropriate, he said. \u201cThe MPC is choosing a period of somewhat higher consumer price inflation in exchange for a more modest increase in unemployment. However, there are limits to the extent to which above-target inflation can be tolerated,\u201d Carney told a news conference. His comments about the Bank\u2019s sensitivity to inflation picking up were interpreted by investors as a signal that policymakers were in no hurry to consider cutting interest rates further. Another rate cut would likely put more pressure on the pound and further stoke price pressures in the economy. The pound, which had received a boost earlier in the day after the high court ruled that parliament should have a say over the triggering of article 50, strengthened further after the Bank\u2019s statement. It rose against the dollar and euro as some economists said that 0.25% now marked the low point for interest rates and that the next move would probably be up. \u201cIf the relatively sanguine view presented in November\u2019s inflation report proves correct, then another interest rate cut now looks unlikely,\u201d said Paul Hollingsworth at the consultancy Capital Economics. \u201cGiven that we think that the economy will surprise the MPC on the upside, and that inflation may be a bit stronger too, we think that the next move in interest rates will be up, and perhaps sooner than most expect.\u201d Back in August, when it reduced interest rates from 0.5% to 0.25%, the Bank had indicated it would support another interest rate cut to about 0.1% by the end of this year if the economy followed its predictions for a sharp slowdown. On Thursday it said that guidance had now \u201cexpired\u201d and it revised up forecasts for economic growth in the final months of this year and throughout 2017. That reflected a succession of business surveys and official data signalling that households and companies have largely shrugged off the Brexit vote, for now, although worries about the UK\u2019s longer-term prospects have dented businesses\u2019 investment plans. Carney commented that households had appeared to \u201centirely look through Brexit-related uncertainties\u201d. \u201cFor households, the signs of an economic slowdown are notable by their absence. Perceptions of job security remain strong. Wages are growing at around the same modest pace as at the start of the year. Credit is available and competitive. Confidence is solid,\u201d he said. But looking further ahead to 2018, the Bank said a squeeze on household incomes from higher inflation and uncertainty about the UK\u2019s future trading position would likely curb growth. Taking the near- and long-term forecasts together, the economic picture in three years\u2019 time was slightly worse than in August\u2019s outlook. The rate decision comes days after Carney was forced to end weeks of speculation about his future as governor by announcing he had agreed to stay on until Brexit negotiations with the EU have ended in 2019. The move followed criticism from pro-Brexit campaigners and MPs unhappy at what they saw as the overpoliticisation of his role in the run-up to the EU referendum, when Carney warned a leave vote could tip the UK into recession. On Thursday, Carney said the independent central bank did not feel under any pressure from the government and batted away requests from reporters to further elaborate on his own career plans, saying: \u201cI think we\u2019ve had enough of that saga.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The pound is holding onto its gains, which were inspired first by the High Court vote on Brexit, and then by the Bank of England keeping interest rates on hold. It is now up 1.2% against the dollar at $1.2447, having been as high as $1.2494. Against the euro it is 1.19% better at \u20ac1.1217. On that note it\u2019s time to close for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. Bank of England governor Mark Carney - who let it not be forgotten has run into some political flak recently - has not yet applied for British citizenship, which he said he would when appointed, Sky is reporting: The High Court ruling that parliament should have a vote on Brexit put the cat among the pigeons, sending the pound soaring and the UK market lower. News that the Bank of England had kept interest rates on hold helped sterling keep much of its gains, and kept the pressure on shares. The FTSE 100 is dominated by exporters and overseas earners who have benefitted from a weak pound, so the reverse is also true. The more domestically focused FTSE 250 managed to gain ground despite the uncertainty. European markets outperformed the UK, helped by positive updates from ING, SocGen and Credit Suisse. The US was struggling for direction as investors fretted about the outcome of next week\u2019s presidential election. There was also one eye on Friday\u2019s non farm payroll numbers. The closing scores in Europe showed: The FTSE 100 finished down 54.91 points or 0.8% at 6790.51 Germany\u2019s Dax dipped 0.43% to 10,325.88 France\u2019s Cac closed down 0.07% at 4411.68 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB fell 0.33% to 16,419.90 Spain\u2019s Ibex bucked the trend and ended 0.07% higher at 8879.9 In Greece, the Athens market slipped 0.57% to 578.23 On Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 8 points or 0.04%. The rise in the pound following the court ruling on Brexit and the Bank of England keeping interest rates on hold may not be the end of it, says Kathleen Brooks, research director at City Index. Sterling is currently up 1.25% against the dollar at $1.2450, and incidently, is also stronger against the euro, up 1.24% at \u20ac1.1224. Brooks said: Although global markets remain at the mercy of the outcome of the US election, if Hillary Clinton does manage to win next week, then the pound may continue to outperform the G10. The Court ruling on Article 50 opens the door to a delayed Brexit, which seems a good enough excuse for the foreign exchange market to extend this pound rally further. The increase in the Bank of England\u2019s inflation forecast could also keep upward pressure on UK Gilt yields, which are the building blocks of a stronger pound, in our view. Overall, US election fears weighing on the dollar, and Brexit fears temporarily receding, could trigger a break above 1.25 in the pound/dollar in the near term. If this happens then we could see the pound/dollar move towards the 1.25-1.30 range between now and the Fed meeting in December. Back with the Bank of England and its forecast changes, Unicredit Research is now expecting UK interest rates to remain on hold next year. Daniel Vernazza, its lead UK economist, said: The tone of the Inflation Report, MPC minutes and the Governor\u2019s press conference were notably \u201cless dovish\u201d than we had expected. In particular, the MPC said monetary policy could now move in \u201ceither direction\u201d to changes to the economic outlook, cancelling its guidance from August that a cut was the most likely next move. As a result, we have now cancelled our expectation for a cut in the bank rate in February next year. We now expect the MPC to remain on hold throughout 2017. So, what\u2019s changed in the last three months? First, economic activity has been much stronger than the BoE had expected...Second, the further depreciation of sterling since the beginning of October will push up inflation meaningfully over the forecast period. Skipping across the Atlantic for a moment, and news of a slowdown in US service sector growth, partly due to caution about next week\u2019s election. The ISM non-manufacturing index fell from 57.1 in September to 54.8 last month, below expectations of a level of 56. Anthony Nieves, chair of the ISM non-manufacturing survey committee, said: There has been a slight cooling-off in the non-manufacturing sector month-over-month, indicating that last month\u2019s increases weren\u2019t sustainable. Respondent\u2019s comments remain mostly positive about business conditions and the overall economy. Several comments were made about the uncertainty on the impact of the upcoming U.S. presidential election. Meanwhile orders for manufactured goods rose by 0.3% in September, up from 0.4% the previous month, the third straight month of increases. Following the figures the Dow Jones Industrial Average is up 37 points or 0.2%. The dollar is still down against the pound, with sterling at $1.2453, up 1.26% following the High Court Brexit decision and the Bank of England deciding not to cut interest rates again. Howard Archer, economist at IHS Markit, is now forecasting UK interest rates to stay at 0.25% for some time. He also expects growth to be slower than the Bank is predicting but inflation to be higher: We are dropping our expectation that interest rates will be taken down to a low of 0.10% We now believe that it is more likely than not interest rates will stay at 0.25% for a prolonged period (very possibly to 2020). Ahead of the November MPC meeting and Quarterly Inflation Report, we had considered it most likely that interest rates would be taken down to 0.10% but not until the second quarter of 2017 when we expected economic activity to be increasingly pressurised by Brexit uncertainty (following the anticipated triggering of Article 50) and diminishing fundamentals for consumers. We are actually more pessimistic than the Bank of England on growth but see inflation higher. Specifically, we forecast GDP growth to slow from 2.1% in 2016 to 1.1% in 2017, then improve only gradually to 1.3% in 2018 and 1.5% in 2019. We see consumer price inflation moving above3% in late-2017 and peaking around 3.5% around spring 2018. It is also notable that Mr. Carney observed that the UK has an outstanding framework for monetary policy, which works well and does not need to be adjusted. This follows recent comments by politicians that could be construed to threaten the Bank of England\u2019s independence as well as some attacks on Mr. Carney and the MPC \u2013 particularly on their stance on the risks from Brexit. The TUC is also worried that households face a severe wage squeeze next year, as the weaker pound drives up inflation. TUC General Secretary Frances O\u2019Grady fears Britain can\u2019t afford a second dose of falling real wages (as seems possible, if companies don\u2019t provide inflation-busting pay rises). O\u2019Grady says: \u201cThe Bank\u2019s warning must spur the government into action so that workers don\u2019t pay the price of Brexit with a squeeze on wages. \u201cUK workers already suffered the largest fall in real wages after the financial crisis of any developed country except Greece \u2013 they can\u2019t afford another hit to their pay packets. \u201cThe Chancellor should use the Autumn Statement to protect jobs and wages, with new investment in infrastructure like roads, rail, green energy and homes. And the national minimum wage must be increased to keep it well ahead of inflation.\u201d And here\u2019s a reminder of the BoE\u2019s new \u2018fan chart\u2019, showing how it expects inflation to romp upwards in 2017 and 2018. Ian Kernohan, Economist at Royal London Asset Management, agrees with Mark Carney that households are going to find life tougher next year, as Brexit uncertainty continues to swirl. He says: GDP growth is likely to slow next year, on the back of a squeeze in real household incomes and ongoing Brexit uncertainty.\u201d If you\u2019re just tuning in, here\u2019s Katie Allen\u2019s news story about how UK interest rates were left on hold today: As suspected, Mark Carney faced some robust questioning at today\u2019s Quarterly Inflation report. The governor found himself having to defend the Bank\u2019s forecasting powers, after it almost doubled its forecast for 2017 growth (to 1.4%), just three months after slashing it drastically. He also repeatedly fended off questions about his own future, and whether he could possibly be lured to stay beyond June 2019. Personally I can\u2019t believe he\u2019d reject the chance for more meetings with the UK economics press pack. But what did we learn? 1) Life is going to get tougher, especially for poorer families. Carney warned that inflation will take a real bite out of earnings, saying: We see very modest real income growth over the course of next year and into 2018.\u201d That\u2019s because the CPI rate is expected to surge to 2.7% in 2017, and hit 2.8% in 2018 -- which is higher than wage growth today. And he said the Bank is facing a balancing act between allowing inflation to rise over target (driving down real wages) and higher unemployment (which would happen if the Bank tightened monetary policy). 2) The economy is doing better than the Bank expected.... Alongside death and taxes, you can be pretty certain that the Bank of England\u2019s economic forecasts will be tweaked before long. But still, today\u2019s upward revisions to growth in 2016 and 2017 are quite significant - and show that the BoE was too gloomy about the immediate impact of voting to leave the EU. Carney painted a picture of serene calm: The MPC had expected consumption to continue to grow solidly throughout the remainder of 2016. But consumption has been even stronger, with households appearing to entirely look through Brexit-related uncertainties. For households, the signs of an economic slowdown are notable by their absence. Perceptions of job security remain strong. Wages are growing at around the same modest pace as at the start of the year. Credit is available and competitive. Confidence is solid. Indeed, he had to pour cold water on the suggestion that consumers are being stupid by still hitting the high street. 3)....but there are signs that things are getting worse The Bank still sees signs that firms are cutting back, as they watch Brexit play out: That uncertainty does bear down on business investment,that effect builds with time, that lower business investment has consequences for employment. 4) We should get used to Brexit uncertainty The governor said that today\u2019s court ruling that MPs must vote on article 50 is simply an example of the drama we should get used to, as Britain leaves the EU. Obviously I am not qualified to comment on the court judgment or the prospects here, but it is an example of the uncertainty that will characterise this process. \u201cThe negotiations haven\u2019t even yet begun, there will be uncertainty, there will be volatility around those negotiations as they proceed, and I would view this as one example of that uncertainty.\u201d 5) The next interest rate move could be up. Britain\u2019s primary schools are full of children who weren\u2019t even born when the Bank last raised interest rates (it was July 2007, just before the credit crunch). And a few months ago, many City economists were convinced rates would fall to 0.1% soon. Not any more, with the BoE dropping its guidance that the next move is probably down. As Carney puts it: You can envisage scenarios where it goes either way. We don\u2019t have a bias in terms of direction of where the next move will be. Again, in a period of a fair bit of uncertainty you can envisage scenarios where either direction would be merited. Make of that what you will.... 6) The Bank of England isn\u2019t at war with Downing Street. Asked about Theresa May\u2019s criticism of monetary policy, he argued: \u201cWe don\u2019t feel under any pressure from the government,certainly none from the prime minister. I think the prime minister fully supports, and the government fully supports, the monetary policy framework we have in place and in that framework we take those decisions.\u201d And he also indicated he accepted criticism from MPs, as part of the Bank\u2019s accountability. He wouldn\u2019t say whether some critics should take a vow of silence, alas. A final question.... is there an inflation level that would force the Bank to take action? Carney won\u2019t be lured into setting a figure -- perhaps burned by his previous experience of forward guidance. It all depends what is causing prices to rise over target, and what the best response is. Q: Are consumers being short-sighted and stupid by still spending, and not realising how difficult things are going to get? Not at all - people still have jobs, and are behaving rationally, Mark Carney replies. Carney is then asked whether Theresa May\u2019s recent criticism of the Bank\u2019s monetary policy, at the Tory party conference, has undermined him. Q: Does he feel any political pressure to change the bank\u2019s forecasts? Not at all, he replies. We don\u2019t feel under any pressure from the government, and especially not from the prime minister. The prime minister, and the government, fully support the monetary policy framework we have in place. Hugo Duncan of the Daily Mail tries to get some new forward guidance out of the governor. Q: Can you tell us whether the next move in interest rates is more likely to be up, or down? You can see scenarios where it goes either way, we don\u2019t have a bias, Mark Carney replies. But the monetary policy committee currently unanimously believes that the present stance is right. Q: If the Brexit process isn\u2019t completed by 2019, might you stay on longer? Carney repeats that we\u2019ve had enough talk about his future. And he then warns that today\u2019s court ruling on article 50 is just one example of the \u201cseries of events\u201d that will take place as Britain leaves the EU, creating uncertainty. Everything doesn\u2019t come together until relatively late in the process, and those effects will be there in the economy. Q: Should families who are just getting by be worried about your inflation forecasts [hitting 2.7% in 2017]? We expect inflation to go up, Carney states bluntly, and that will hit people in the pocket. But he then flags up that the Bank expects wage growth to be stronger by 2020. There\u2019s a difficult period here, but it has to be put into context. Q: How much would the pound have to fall, and how fast, to concern you - and would you intervene in the currency markets? Carney says the BoE doesn\u2019t target the sterling exchange rate, but it isn\u2019t \u2018indifferent\u2019 to it. Ben Chu of the Independent takes the governor back to the recent criticism from pro-Brexit MPs, and the claim from former foreign secretary William Hague that central bankers had lost the plot. Q: Is this undermining Bank independence, and should your critics take a vow of silence? Carney grins, and slips into Canadian as he mutters \u201cJeez, It\u2019s a trap\u201d. He then says there is a robust mechanism of accountability, including regular appearances before parliamentary committees. The debate should be as \u2018vigorous\u2019 as necessary. And it\u2019s important that the MPC recognises the limits of its responsibilities, he adds. Q: Three months ago the Bank made major downward revisions to its growth forecasts, and today it\u2019s made major upward revisions. So is there a problem with your forecasting? Carney argues that we shouldn\u2019t get carried away with short-term revisions. Broadly speaking, the size of the UK economy is still expected to be roughly the same in two or three years as we thought in August. Deputy governor Ben Broadbent weighs in too, saying that most independent forecasters expected the economy would contract after the Brexit vote. That was more negative (and thus wronger) than the Bank\u2019s own forecasts. Q: Could you be persuaded to stay at the Bank of England beyond 2019, if things are going well? I think we\u2019ve all had enough of that saga, Carney shoots back, in an attempt to keep talk of his future nailed down [reminder, on Monday he agreed to serve one more year, until June 2019] Q: Does the recent news storm over your future show that the relationship between the government and the Bank needs to change? Carney argues that the current system, in which the government hands control of monetary policy to technocrats such as himself, is working. \u201cI don\u2019t think the framework needs to change, i think it works quite well\u201d Q: UK bond yields are up sharply since your stimulus package in August, so has it failed - and has monetary policy shot its bolt? No, Carney replies. He argues that the Bank could still buy more British gilts if needed. Carney denies that the Bank has got ahead of itself and been \u201cpresumptuous\u201d by trying to predict the kind of Brexit deal that Britain will end up with. Q: The bank has cut its growth forecasts for 2018, so is the pain of Brexit simply being delayed? Carney replies that the Bank sees \u201cvery modest real income growth\u201d in 2017 and 2018, as inflation eats into wages. Onto questions.... Q: Does this morning\u2019s court Article 50 court ruling [saying parliament must vote on the issue] add to the uncertainly overshadowing the UK economy? It is an example of the uncertainty that will characterise this process, Carney replies. The negotiations haven\u2019t even begun. There will be volatility as those negotiations proceed. I see it as one of the examples of that uncertainty. Some instant reaction: In conclusion, Carney says that Britain has a dynamic, flexible economy, and that will help it handle the Brexit process. Carney says that the Bank of England can look through the prospect of inflation jumping over its target, for the wider good of the economy. But it cannot ignore inflation indefinitely. The fall in sterling appears to reflect market expectations that Britain will have a \u2018less open\u2019 trading relationship with Europe, Carney continues. The governor warns that the slump in the pound will have more significant implications for inflation than for growth [in other words, it\u2019s a net negative]. And Carney then warns that people are going to be hit in the pocket, saying: Modest supply growth ultimately means lower real income growth. The stimulus package announced by the Bank of England in August is working, Carney declared. He says credit is widely available, mortgage borrowing costs are lower, and unemployment is still low. But... financial markets have taken a \u2018less sanguine\u2019 view of Brexit, he adds, pointing to the slump in the pound (down around a sixth since the referendum), and rising UK bond yields (a measure of government borrowing costs. Mark Carney begins by telling reporters that the terms of Britain\u2019s exit from the EU is the most important single factor affecting the UK economy. That UK\u2019s new relationship with the EU will be the \u201cbiggest driver\u201d of medium-term prosperity, he adds. And he points out that economic demand has been stronger than expected in August. The Bank of England is holding a press conference right now. You can watch it here. Sterling has hit a new three-week high, and is now up almost two cents at $1.249. Traders are calculating that there is less chance of the BoE cutting interest rates further. Indeed, the Bank of England now points out that it could raise rates, not cut them, in future: It says: Monetary policy can respond, in either direction, to changes to the economic outlook as they unfold to ensure a sustainable return of inflation to the 2% target. Here are the key points from the Bank\u2019s quarterly forecasts and policy decision: Interest rates held at 0.25% and no change to scheme announced in August to pump additional \u00a360bn in electronic cash into the economy to buy government bonds and \u00a310bn to buy corporate bonds GDP growth in 2016 now expected to be 2.2%, up from 2.0% forecast in August GDP growth in 2017 now expected to be 1.4%, up from 0.8% forecast in August But GDP growth in 2018 now expected to be 1.5%, down from 1.8% forecast in August Inflation rises from 1.3% this year to 2.7% in 2017 and in 2018, higher than August forecasts Inflation eases back to 2.5% in 2019 and expected to return close to Bank\u2019s 2.0% target in 2020 Here\u2019s our economics reporter Katie Allen\u2019s first take on the Bank of England\u2019s quarterly inflation report: The Bank of England abandoned plans for further cuts to interest rates as it conceded the economy had stood up to the shock of June\u2019s Brexit vote without the sharp slowdown Mark Carney and fellow policymakers had predicted. The Bank left rates at 0.25% as expected by investors and revised up forecasts for economic growth in the final months of this year and throughout 2017, compared with their outlook published in August. But they also warned that sterling\u2019s sharp fall would push up inflation more than previously thought. That in turn would squeeze household incomes and coupled with uncertainty about the UK\u2019s longer-term prospects outside the EU would stem economic growth in 2018. Taking the near and long-term forecasts together the economic picture in three years\u2019 time is slightly worse than in August\u2019s outlook. The forecasts accompanied a unanimous decision by the Bank\u2019s nine-strong monetary policy committee (MPC) to leave interest rates at 0.25%, where they had been cut to in August to shore up confidence after June\u2019s vote to leave the EU. In comments likely to be interpreted by financial markets as ruling out any more QE or interest rate cuts any time soon, the Bank also said it could respond \u201cin either direction\u201d to changes in the economic outlook and used minutes from its latest policy meeting to highlight how the weaker pound pushes up inflation. The Bank also said \u201cthere are limits to the extent to which above-target inflation can be tolerated.\u201d The Bank of England fears that the uncertainty over Brexit will push unemployment higher, from its current rate of 4.9% [There is a ] risk that UK-based firms\u2019 access to EU markets could be materially reduced, which could restrain business activity and supply growth over a protracted period. The unemployment rate is projected to rise to around 5.5% by the middle of 2018 and to stay at around that level throughout 2019. The Bank of England admits that the UK economy has outperformed its expectations in the three months since it slashed rates. It says: In the three months since then, indicators of activity and business sentiment have recovered from their lows immediately following the referendum and the preliminary estimate of GDP growth in Q3 was above expectations [reminder: it was 0.5%, not 0.1%]. These data suggest that the near-term outlook for activity is stronger than expected three months ago. Household spending appears to have grown at a somewhat faster pace than projected in August, and the housing market has been more resilient than expected. By contrast, investment intentions have continued to soften and the commercial property market has been subdued. That\u2019s a victory for Brexit campaigners who claimed the BoE was too gloomy about Brexit, argues The Sun\u2019s Steve Hawkes. This chart shows how the Bank has hiked its inflation forecast, and is also more optimistic about growth next year: (these fan charts show the relative likelihood of various eventualities, with darker areas showing what\u2019s most likely) OUCH! The Bank of England sees inflation spiking sharply over the next couple of years. It now believes inflation will hit 2.7% in a years time (that\u2019s up from 2.0% back at the August report) And the consumer prices index is expected to peak at 2.83% in the second quarter of 2018. The Bank of England has also hiked its growth forecasts for this year, and next year. It now says the UK economy will grow by 2.2% in 2016, up from 2% previously. And for 2017, it now sees growth of 1.4% -- sharply higher than the 0.8% it initially expected. It\u2019s not all good news, though. It has cut its 2018 growth forecast to 1.5%, from 1.8%. Breaking! The Bank of England has voted to leave interest rates on hold, at the current record low of 0.25%. The MPC has also left its quantitative easing programme unchanged, at \u00a3425bn. Both decisions was unanimous, with the committee voting 9-0. Positive Money\u2019s Fran Boait wrote about the idea of \u2018People\u2019s QE\u2019 for the Guardian last month. Here\u2019s a flavour: An idea that is gaining traction is that monetary and fiscal policy could work together to deliver \u201cmonetary financing\u201d. Under this proposal, new money would be created by the Bank as with QE, but instead would be spent into the economy by the government to boost investment, employment and incomes. It\u2019s an idea known as people\u2019s QE. This might sound radical, but currently, it\u2019s considered good if banks create money, regardless of whether they use it to lend to businesses or to blow up property bubbles. However, it\u2019s considered taboo if the central bank creates money to finance government spending for the real economy. It\u2019s time to break that taboo. My colleague Katie Allen has captured some photos of the Positive Money protest against the Bank of England\u2019s stimulus programme this morning: As explained earlier, Positive Money want to stop the Bank of England\u2019s quantitative easing scheme, which is now creating \u00a3425bn of new money. Instead, it wants the government to control the money-creation process. Positive Money\u2019s Executive Director, Fran Boait says the BoE and the government should rethink monetary policy, rather than relying on QE and ultra-low interest rates. She told CNBC that: Since the crash we\u2019ve had low interest rates, and they\u2019ve created one of the slowest recoveries in history. Just 30 minutes to go until the Bank of England announces its decision on interest rates, and unveils its new economic forecasts. Here\u2019s what to watch for: Has the BoE cut rates to fresh record lows? (it probably won\u2019t) Has it boosted its stimulus programme? (also unlikely, as there are no signs that Britain is falling into recession). Has it raised its growth forecasts? In August, the Bank predicted that growth would slow to a miserable 0.8% in 2017. That now looks too pessimistic, given Britain\u2019s companies appear to be growing quite strongly. How about inflation? It\u2019s now clear that the weak pound is driving up import costs; that\u2019s likely to hit consumers hard next year. What\u2019s over the horizon? The Bank could conclude that leaving the EU vote will damage the UK\u2019s longer-term economic prospects (but until we know more about Brexit, it\u2019s hard to know). And then the City will hang on governor Mark Carney\u2019s every word at the press conference, from 12.30pm. Dean Turner, economist at UBS Wealth Management, says: The market is eagerly awaiting the Bank of England\u2019s Inflation Report, which should bring further clarity as to likely path of monetary policy in the months ahead. We expect the BoE to leave policy unchanged at the midday announcement.\u201d City traders believe that the High Court ruling on article 50 will trigger even more wild drama in the currency markets. Mihir Kapadia, CEO and Founder of Sun Global Investments, predicts that the pound will be volatile. \u201cThe historic announcement that the UK government has lost the Brexit case in High Court means that Parliament must vote on whether to trigger Article 50. Theresa May claims this is a subversion of justice whilst \u2018In\u2019 campaigners will be thrilled; one thing is for certain that current market volatility will be heightened. The government will appeal to the Supreme Court, however if they agree with the High Court judgement there could be a big impasse with no clear route for resolution. The pound which was already rising spiked further on the news and no doubt there will be further repercussions in the markets, as we await the Bank of England\u2019s announcement at midday today.\u201d Today\u2019s rally has pushed the pound to its highest level since last month\u2019s \u2018flash crash\u2019, when sterling slumped alarmingly in Asian trading to just $1.15. But as this chart shows, sterling is still weaker than in September - before the Conservative Party conference ignited fears that Britain could lose membership of the single market after Brexit: At these low levels, the pound appears to be priced for a \u2018hard Brexit\u2019 Mike Bird of the Wall Street Journal tweets: One thing is certain - it\u2019s mighty difficult to have much faith in the Bank of England\u2019s new economic forecasts in the current political climate. How can its finest minds predict UK growth and inflation in such an uncertain climate? (reminder, the Bank releases the quarterly inflation report at noon) Neil Wilson of ETX Capital explains why sterling has spiked this morning - and why the City is struggling to decide what happens next: \u201cThe High Court ruling on Article 50 is a body blow for Theresa May and the Brexit-leaning ministers at the heart of government. It\u2019s made triggering Brexit a lot trickier and has given sterling a massive shot in the arm. The stage is now set for a fresh battle over Brexit and there is the prospect that Parliament will block Britain\u2019s withdrawal from the EU, albeit a dim and distant one for now. We need to get more clarity on what MPs think and intend to do about this now they have a say. In a year of political surprises, who would bet against another one? A massive grass-roots Remain campaign could tilt the balance. The news sent the pound roaring through $1.24 before gains were pared as markets digest the news \u2013 the fact is no one really knows what the implications of this decision are yet. An appeal is coming in early December, so this is not final. Cable was last at $1.2432, its highest level in almost a month. Even if Article 50 is triggered as planned, this judgment could underpin sterling for some time and assuage fears about a \u2018hard Brexit\u2019 if the pro-EU camps in Parliament start to dictate terms to the government in return for voting with the people. We could see this create a floor under the pound around $1.25. Politics and uncertainty continue to drive the currency markets.\u201d And here\u2019s our diplomatic editor: The pound is trading at a three-week high against the US dollar, as everyone ponders the ramifications of the government\u2019s defeat (which we\u2019re liveblogging here) Some experts are predicting that parliament would give its approval for Article 50 be triggered, rather than ignore the result of June\u2019s referendum. But that\u2019s not definite. The court ruling may make it harder for Theresa May to start the process by March 2017, and could even encourage the PM to hold an early general election... The FT\u2019s Alex Barker sums it up: Newsflash: The government has lost the Brexit case in the high court. Judges have ruled that Theresa May does not have the power to trigger article 50 without a parliamentary vote. This sent the pound surging over $1.24, before swiftly dropping back... as the Supreme Court will now hear an appeal, in early December. Here\u2019s Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Marki, on today\u2019s Service sector PMI report: \u201cAn encouraging picture of the economy gaining further growth momentum in October is marred by news that inflationary pressures are rising rapidly. \u201cBusiness activity is growing at a rate consistent with solid economic growth of 0.4-0.5% in the fourth quarter (the surveys suggest the initial 0.5% GDP growth estimate for the third quarter could be revised slightly lower). What\u2019s especially reassuring is that growth is also becoming more balanced. Manufacturing is leading the expansion as exporters benefit from the weaker pound, but services growth is also reviving and construction is being boosted by renewed house building. But... \u201cThe ugly flip-side of the weaker pound is clearly evident, however, with the rate of increase of service providers\u2019 costs showing the largest monthly acceleration seen in 20 years of survey data collection. Costs are consequently rising at the fastest rate for over five years. If sustained, the increase in prices threatens to curb both corporate hiring and consumer spending, as firms seek to reduce staff costs and households see their pay eroded by rising inflation. As such, Williamson doesn\u2019t think the Bank of England will launch any new stimulus measures soon - and will keep its powder dry in case the economy deteriorates. This jump in service sector growth means that all three sectors of the UK economy expanded in October. We\u2019d already learned this week that manufacturing growth slowed sightly, while construction activity surged. Altogether, it shows that growth is accelerating - as firms put the immediate shock of June\u2019s referendum behind them, and get a boost from the weaker pound. Breaking: Britain\u2019s service sector has just posted its fastest growth since January, but there are also worrying signs that inflation is building. Data firm Markit says that total business activity accelerated in October, as did new business expansion. Firms also kept hiring more workers, to deal with a flurry of new business. Companies reported that they are seeing more demand from overseas thanks to the weak pound. This drove up the services PMI, Markit\u2019s measure of activity, up to 54.5 in October - up from 52.6 in September. That\u2019s the highest reading since January, suggesting the economy is continuing to grow fairly solidly. David Noble, group CEO at the Chartered Institute of Procurement &amp; Supply, says it\u2019s an encouraging sign: Concerns over the EU referendum result showed some signs of dissipating as respondents commented on a re- focus on opportunities and ramped up marketing and sales promotions. \u201cHowever, business optimism remained lukewarm in spite of the spike in new orders and was below the long-term average of the survey\u2019s history. Staffing levels showed a moderate improvement but at weaker levels than seen over the past three years. However... firms also reported that import costs are rising very steeply. Input price inflation surged to the highest since March 2011 -- and with the biggest month-on-month jump ever. That\u2019s due to the weak pound, and is another sign that UK inflation is going to spike in the months ahead -- as firms pass these costs onto consumers. Noble explains: \u201cThe exchange rate on the pound continued to be a blessing and a curse as opportunities for more export-related activity such as tourism improved. On the other hand, input price inflation accelerated to a level not seen since March 2011 as healthy margins were challenged. Higher food and fuel prices were highlighted. Our Politics Live blog is tracking the article 50 ruling: My colleague Alice Ross is braving the autumn chill.... Today will be a crucial day for the pound. It\u2019s bound to be volatile at noon, when the Bank of England\u2019s new growth and inflation forecasts hit the wires. Mark Carney could also move sterling, when he speaks to the press at 12.30pm. Lee Hardman, Currency Analyst at MUFG, say the pound could rally if the Bank suggests further rate cuts are unlikely: \u201cWe expect Governor Carney to reiterate in the accompanying press conference that the BoE is not indifferent to weakness in the pound. Delivering a rate cut in the near-term could prove counter-productive if it further destabilises the pound and triggers another lurch lower increasing upside risks to inflation.\u201d And in just 30 minutes time, the High Court will rule on whether MPs must get a vote on whether to trigger article 50. Hardman says the pound will spike if judges say parliament should have its say: \u201cWe believe that a judgement in favour of requiring a vote in parliament to trigger Article 50 could trigger a sizeable short squeeze higher for the pound in the near-term. It would help ease the market\u2019s current elevated level of pessimism regarding the risk of a harder Brexit.\u201d A small protest is taking place outside the Bank of England, by campaigners who oppose its bond-buying quantitative easing programme. The group, called Positive Money, believe that the government should take back the ability to make and distribute money from the commercial banks (who currently create money whenever they issue a loan). Here are some photos: Positive Money argue that the current levels of inequality, personal debts, and high government borrowing all stem from the banks\u2019 control of the money-printing. As they put it: We believe the power to create money must be removed from the banks that caused the financial crisis and returned to a democratic, transparent and accountable body. New money must only be created and used to benefit the public and society as a whole, rather than just financial sector. City economist and author George Cooper isn\u2019t convinced you can actually create money without debt*, but still welcomes their contribution to the debate.... * - basically because money is (among other things) transferrable credit (as explained here) This chart shows how the Bank of England only expected the UK to grow by 0.1% in the last three months; data last week showed growth of 0.5%. But Bloomberg also show how the public are already anticipating higher prices in the shops: Kallum Pickering of Berenberg expects the Bank of England to say that growth and inflation in 2017 will both be higher than previously forecast. This charts shows his new charts, vs the Bank\u2019s August forecasts: He also expects Mark Carney to \u2018take stock\u2019 of the UK economy today, rather than announce any more stimulus moves. The BoE\u2019s decision to provide extra liquidity around the vote and then to announce a suitably large monetary stimulus in response to the sharp downgrades in the market\u2019s assessment of the UK\u2019s economic outlook was appropriate. A central bank needs to satisfy the markets\u2019 need for liquidity during periods of stress to limit the risk that a modest crisis turns into a severe one. But the UK\u2019s better-than-expected economic performance since the vote has removed the need for the BoE to act again. Samuel Tombs of Pantheon Macroeconomics believes the Bank of England will predict that inflation will rise to 2.2% in 2017, up from the 1.9% it forecast in August. That\u2019s more than double September\u2019s reading of 1.0%. For 2018, he thinks the BoE will forecast inflation of 2.6%, up from 2.3% three months ago, and some way above its 2% target. It\u2019s unusual for the Bank to predict that it will miss its own inflation target; it usually calculates that it will have adjusted monetary policy to get CPI in line (it doesn\u2019t always achieve this, of course). Tombs says: \u201cThe [Bank\u2019s] forecast for CPI inflation in two years\u2019 time will be the highest since it began forecasting the CPI 12 years ago\u201d. Labour MP Angela Eagle fears that living standards are about to be squeezed. Sterling is rising in early trading, as investors await news from the Bank of England at noon. It\u2019s up 0.3% at $1.2345, on track for its fifth \u2018up day\u2019 in a row. A few months back, many City economists were predicting the Bank would cut interest rates to a fresh record low today. But, with the economy performing better than feared since June \u2013 and signs that the weak pound is pushing up inflation \u2013 almost everyone expects the BoE to leave borrowing costs at 0.25%. Kathleen Brooks of City Index explains: Only 2 out of 58 economists polled by Bloomberg expect the BOE to cut interest rates at this meeting. The market is currently pricing in a mere 5% chance of a rate cut on Thursday, back in September there was a 25% chance of a cut. As UK inflation and growth have both beat forecasts in recent weeks, UK interest rate expectations have drifted higher. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. It\u2019s Super Thursday - the time each quarter when the Bank of England sets interest rates, issues its new assessment of the UK economy, and submits its governor for a grilling from the UK economics press. And Mark Carney may have a lot of explaining to do. That\u2019s partly because the Bank is expected to revise up its short-term growth forecasts; an admission it was too gloomy about the impact of the Brexit vote. Back in August, the BoE said growth would slow sharply to just 0.1% in July-September; actually, it was a robust 0.5%. Carney could say the stimulus measures taken by the Bank are having an effect, but critics will continue to argue that he were too gloomy about Brexit. Some economists expect the BoE to lower its medium-term growth forecasts, as it tries to assess the impact of Britain leaving the EU. That\u2019s a tricky calculation, as we don\u2019t know what kind of deal the UK will end up with. The Bank may also hike its inflation forecasts, as the slump in the pound since June continues to push up the cost of imports. That could show the Consumer Prices Index smashing through the official 2% target next year. If that happens, how long will the Bank be prepared to ignore the rising cost of living? And of course, Carney can expect several questions about his decision to extend his term by an extra 12 months, to summer 2019. Has the criticism from pro-Brexit MPs deterred him from staying until 2021? And has the Bank\u2019s independence been undermined? Ranjiv Mann, head of global sovereign research &amp; Strategy at Rogge Global Partners, expects Carney to revise up his 2016 growth forecast, but still sound cautious. He says: We expect another 9-0 vote to leave monetary policy unchanged Sterling depreciation is set to send CPI inflation above the 2% inflation target in 2017/18 However, the Bank will want to affirm its easing bias, particularly if it lowers its projections for medium term growth prospects The interest rate decision comes at noon, along with the quarterly inflation report Mark Carney\u2019s press conference begins at 12.30pm, and runs for an hour. Also coming up today.... There will be high drama at 10am, when the UK high court rules on whether Theresa May can start the process of exiting the EU without a parliamentary vote. Owen Bowcott, our legal affairs correspondent, sets the scene: The lord chief justice is to deliver the high court\u2019s momentous decision on whether parliament or the government has the constitutional power to trigger Brexit. After less than three weeks considering the politically charged case with two other senior judges, Lord Thomas of Cwmgiedd will read out a summary of their decision at 10am on Thursday to a packed courtroom in London\u2019s Royal Courts of Justice. In order to prevent leaks of the market-sensitive ruling, which involves a large number of parties, preliminary drafts of the judgment have unusually not been sent out in advance to the lawyers. The outcome of the case, which ventures into constitutionally untested ground, will resolve whether MPs or ministers have the authority to formally inform Brussels about whether the UK intends to leave the European Union. On the corporate front, supermarket Morrisons, insurance chain RSA gold miner Randgold and food group Tate &amp; Lyle are all reporting to the City. At 9.30am, we find out how fast Britain\u2019s services sector grew last month. And there\u2019s a flurry of US economic data this afternoon, including a healthcheck on the Service sector for October, and factory orders for September.",

The increase in the Bank of England\u2019s inflation forecast could also keep upward pressure on UK Gilt yields, which are the building blocks of a stronger pound, in our view.</p> <p>Overall, US election fears weighing on the dollar, and Brexit fears temporarily receding, could trigger a break above 1.25 in the pound/dollar in the near term.

Ahead of the November MPC meeting and Quarterly Inflation Report, we had considered it most likely that interest rates would be taken down to 0.10% but not until the second quarter of 2017 when we expected economic activity to be increasingly pressurised by Brexit uncertainty (following the anticipated triggering of Article 50) and diminishing fundamentals for consumers.</p> <p>We are actually more pessimistic than the Bank of England on growth but see inflation higher. Specifically, we forecast GDP growth to slow from 2.1% in 2016 to 1.1% in 2017, then improve only gradually to 1.3% in 2018 and 1.5% in 2019. We see consumer price inflation moving above3% in late-2017 and peaking around 3.5% around spring 2018.</p> <p>It is also notable that Mr. Carney observed that the UK has an outstanding framework for monetary policy, which works well and does not need to be adjusted.

Mark Carney and fellow policymakers had predicted.</p> <p>The Bank left rates at 0.25% as expected by investors and revised up forecasts for economic growth in the final months of this year and throughout 2017, compared with their outlook published in August. But they also warned that sterling\u2019s sharp fall would push up inflation more than previously thought. That in turn would squeeze household incomes and coupled with uncertainty about the UK\u2019s longer-term prospects outside the EU would stem economic growth in 2018. Taking the near and long-term forecasts together the economic picture in three years\u2019 time is slightly worse than in August\u2019s outlook.</p> <p>The forecasts accompanied a unanimous decision by the Bank\u2019s nine-strong monetary policy committee (MPC) to leave interest rates at 0.25%, where they had been cut to in August to shore up confidence after June\u2019s vote to leave the EU.</p> <p>In comments likely to be interpreted by financial markets as ruling out any more QE or interest rate cuts any time soon, the Bank also said it could respond \u201cin either direction\u201d to changes in the economic outlook and used minutes from its latest policy meeting to highlight how the weaker pound pushes up inflation.

Back in August, the BoE said growth would slow sharply to just 0.1% in July-September; actually, it was a robust 0.5%.</p> <p>Carney could say the stimulus measures taken by the Bank are having an effect, but critics will continue to argue that he were too gloomy about Brexit.</p> <p>Some economists expect the BoE to <strong>lower</strong> its medium-term growth forecasts, as it tries to assess the impact of Britain leaving the EU. That\u2019s a tricky calculation, as we don\u2019t know what kind of deal the UK will end up with.</p> <p><strong>The Bank may also hike its inflation forecasts</strong>, as the slump in the pound since June continues to push up the cost of imports. That could show the Consumer Prices Index smashing through the official 2% target next year.

Born in Redbridge, north-east London, to Sakuntala (nee Thirunavakarasoe) and Balasubramaniam Kathirgamathamby, a research chemist for Croda, Ahilan was the eldest of three, with two sisters, Vaani and me. He attended Cleveland junior school, Redbridge, before the family relocated to Huddersfield for his father\u2019s work in 1989, when he went to Paddock primary school for a year before going to Royds Hall secondary school then Greenhead sixth-form college. He began a pharmacy degree at Bradford University in 1996, however, his studies were hindered by his selfless decision to be my carer when I became ill for a period. He eventually qualified as a pharmacist in 2004 and battled against the pushing of slimming aids at his place of work at the time. He minimised the number of in-store advertisements and ensured all over-the-counter purchases included a consultation. Ahilan took his managerial role seriously, particularly with respect to the welfare of his employees. He became a pre-registration tutor, ensuring pharmacy graduates met the standards necessary to obtain General Pharmaceutical Council (GPhC) registration. He also helped to establish smoking cessation and healthy weight-loss clinics in partnership with a GP practice. Ahilan paid off our parents\u2019 mortgage with his salary and sold the shares he had received through work to repair our family home following flood damage, without divulging this generosity at the time. While he enjoyed reading everything from Anton Chekhov to Robert Jordan, for him no writer could top JRR Tolkien. He loved his work for the same reasons he also adored Star Wars: they contain the message that hope may be found even when we feel the deepest despair. His other great passion was weightlifting, pushing himself to deadlift \u2013 raise to hip level \u2013 increasingly heavier weights, which he saw as a test of his physical strength and inner resolve. After developing cancer in 2008, aged 29, Ahilan found solace in writing a children\u2019s book, The Little Polar Bear and Aningan, studying for an Open University English literature degree, and painting. He also continued weight training, deadlifting 225kg. Finding hope in the pursuit of change, Ahilan, a lifelong Amnesty International member who always put others before himself, wrote numerous letters in support of its campaigns. In particular, he was concerned about human rights abuses in Sri Lanka. Ahilan died on the holy day of Guru Purnima, surrounded by his loved ones. He is survived by Balasubramaniam, Sakuntala, Vaani and me.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Sir Philip Green could be forced to pay hundreds of millions of pounds into the BHS pension scheme after the Pensions Regulator began formal proceedings against the billionaire tycoon. However, the regulator faces a long and arduous battle to erase the pension scheme\u2019s \u00a3571m deficit. What action has the regulator taken this week on BHS? The regulator has issued a warning notice to Sir Philip Green and the most recent owner of BHS, Dominic Chappell, and their companies. These warning notices run to more than 300 pages and explain why the regulator believes them liable for providing financial support to the BHS pension scheme, through a one-off contribution and ongoing support. Green and Chappell have been sent different notices. The regulator will not disclose the difference between the notices, but it is understood Green faces far larger financial demands than Chappell, a serial bankrupt. Why has the regulator done this now? It launched an anti-avoidance investigation into BHS in March 2015 after Green sold the department store chain to Chappell. The regulator, led by chief executive Lesley Titcomb, has gathered more than 100,000 documents and now believes it has a case against Green and Chappell. At the same time, the regulator and the Pension Protection Fund have been in talks with Green about a bailout for the pension scheme, but the talks have broken down without a deal despite the tycoon pledging to \u201csort\u201d the problems facing BHS pensioners. With no deal in place, the regulator has activated its legal powers instead. What happens next? Green and Chappell now have several months to formally respond. Once those responses have been sent, the regulator\u2019s determinations panel will meet to consider the case and make a ruling. The panel is independent from other parts of the regulator and the team that has investigated BHS, but it has the power to demand cash payments or that parties provide ongoing support to the pension scheme. Can the regulator legally force Green to make a payment? Yes, if the determinations panel rules that he should. The regulator was given extensive legal powers through a series of pensions laws. However, Green can appeal against the decision through the legal system, starting with the upper tribunal, then the court of appeal, and finally the supreme court. What are the chances of winning a legal battle? The regulator is heading into unknown territory. It was founded in 2005 but has issued warning notices in just 16 cases. Some of these cases were about establishing pensioners as creditors for a company which has gone bust, such as Lehman Brothers, rather than seeking cash from a third party. A similar case involving Coats Group plc, the thread-making business, has yet to develop beyond the warning notice issued three years ago. What does this mean for Green\u2019s knighthood? The latest development is not positive for the honour. After MPs voted unanimously to strip the tycoon of his title, probably his final hope would be agreeing a rescue deal for the BHS pension scheme. The regulator is still open to agreeing a deal with Green, but the start of enforcement action shows it is not confident about agreeing anything. Ultimately, the forfeiture committee will make a recommendation to the prime minister about the knighthood, but the regulator\u2019s announcement will not count in Green\u2019s favour.",

    "webTitle": "Southern rail workers to strike over Christmas and new year", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Southern rail commuters are to be hit by yet more delays and cancellations over Christmas and the new year as the RMT union has given notice of additional strikes in the heart of the festive period. Southern accused the union of \u201chitting a new low\u201d, warning that the strikes would affect families travelling home for Christmas as well as shops and businesses at their busiest time. A three-day strike by conductors starting on 22 December until the last trains on Christmas Eve will be followed by another three-day strike starting on New Year\u2019s Eve. A spokesman for Southern said: \u201cNot content with causing months of misery, the RMT has now hit a new low and is determined to cancel Christmas for the travelling public. \u201cThese latest strikes will not just hit families wanting to get home for Christmas but also the shops and businesses for whom Christmas is their busiest time. These strikes are spiteful, vindictive and pointless given the majority of conductors have now signed up to the new onboard role.\u201d The action comes as part of a long-running dispute between the union and Southern\u2019s operating company, Govia Thameslink Railway (GTR), over plans to reform the role of the conductor and potentially run trains without a second crew member aboard. While unions say the move jeopardises safety, GTR claims the union is opposing it to \u201chang on to outdated working practices and union power\u201d. Trains would normally stop running early in the evening on Christmas Eve, which this year falls on a Saturday. But passengers could be faced with additional disruption on the two last working days before the holiday, as well as the last shopping day. A reduced service had been due to run from Boxing Day until new year, with special trains running through the night on New Year\u2019s Eve to take revellers from central London to Croydon. With strikes, Southern will not operate a full service after 21 December until 3 January. GTR said it was too early to predict which trains would be able to run. Southern has managed to run about three in five trains during recent strikes, and said it hoped to exceed that figure for the next walkout, which starts on Friday. The announcement of fresh industrial action came on a day when the RMT had suspended a strike at the request of the British Legion, on one of its biggest fundraising days ahead of Remembrance Day. However, a 48-hour walkout will start at midnight on Thursday, affecting services over the weekend, including stopping all trains to Lewes around the town\u2019s famous Bonfire night celebrations. The RMT general secretary, Mick Cash, said the action was being forced by the \u201csheer pigheadedness of the company and the government\u201d. He said: \u201cGovia Thameslink and the government have made it clear that they have no interest in resolving this dispute. RMT has called repeatedly for the transport secretary, Chris Grayling, to get out of his bunker, get hold of the company and get round the negotiating table. He continues to ignore us. \u201cIf government ministers can meet with our colleagues from the Prison Officers Association over safety in prisons then there is no reason whatsoever why they can\u2019t meet with RMT over safety on our railways.\u201d Two further strikes are already planned for November and early December, the ninth and 10th walkouts this year. So far, 15 days of strikes since April have compounded major disruption caused by staff shortages and engineering works. While both the RMT and GTR issued statements earlier this week proclaiming their readiness for talks, no meeting occurred. The company has made some guarantees on jobs, and offered a \u00a32,000 bonus payment and above-inflation pay rises for two years. But it has pursued a demand to have the option of operating trains with just a driver aboard in some circumstances \u2013 something the union believes will ultimately threaten jobs.",

RMT has called repeatedly for the transport secretary, Chris Grayling, to get out of his bunker, get hold of the company and get round the negotiating table.

The company has made some guarantees on jobs, and offered a \u00a32,000 bonus payment and above-inflation pay rises for two years.

      "bodyText": "An Oscar-winning British visual effects company, which has worked on films including Doctor Strange and the Harry Potter franchise, is selling itself to a Chinese group in a deal that values it at nearly \u00a3150m. Framestore has agreed a deal with Cultural Investment Holdings Co (CIH) that will mean the Shanghai-listed group acquiring 75% of the business. The remainder is owned by the firm\u2019s founder and chief executive, Sir William Sargent, and the rest of the management team. Framestore is currently working on Paddington 2, the sequel to last year\u2019s box office success about the bear from Peru. The London-based firm has also performed the visual effects for JK Rowling\u2019s Harry Potter spinoff Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them, which opens later this month. As part of the deal, Malaysia\u2019s sovereign wealth fund Khazanah Nasional Berhad is selling its 30% stake in Framestore along with other shareholders who used to work for the business. \u201cI started the process about nine months ago. We\u2019re swapping the partners we had before for the Chinese group,\u201d said Sargent, who set up Framestore 30 years ago and retains a 10% stake. \u201cI\u2019m looking east.\u201d Following the firm\u2019s success in North America and Europe, it wants to tap into the fast-growing Chinese and Indian film markets. \u201cIt\u2019s not easy to do on our own,\u201d he said. Sargent said CIH had been chosen from a list of 100 interested parties that included bidders from North America, the UK and Asia-Pacific. Framestore employs two people in Beijing, the centre of the Chinese film industry, and plans to open an office there before Christmas. CIH is also based in Beijing. Framestore started as a five-person team based in Soho, the heart of London\u2019s creative industries, and has become one of the world\u2019s biggest post-production houses in the film industry. It now employs 1,400 staff and has offices in London, New York, Montreal and Los Angeles. Framestore works with Hollywood film studios Warner Bros and Disney-owned Marvel. It has won an Oscar for its work on Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n\u2019s Gravity in 2014 and was nominated for Oscars for Superman Returns, The Dark Knight and Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows \u2013 Part 1. The deal would be the latest in a series of Chinese takeovers of British companies. Cala Homes, the UK\u2019s largest private housebuilder, is reportedly in talks with Chinese property developer Evergrande Group, whose shareholders include Alibaba chief executive Jack Ma. British television and film production is booming, thanks to a number of tax breaks. According to the latest official figures, film and TV programme production was the fastest-growing segment within Britain\u2019s dominant services sector in the third quarter, with 16.4% growth.",

      "bodyText": "British car manufacturing is at risk of \u201cdeath by a thousand cuts\u201d if companies invest in other countries rather than the UK after the Brexit vote, an industry leader has warned. The UK industry faces the threat of gradual decline should foreign carmakers overlook the UK when choosing where to build a new model or factory according to Mike Hawes, chief executive of the trade body the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders. Hawes said the recent decision by Japanese carmaker Nissan to invest more in its Sunderland plant was encouraging for the broader industry, but said the UK was in a constant battle to attract and retain investment. He told a House of Lords select committee that any impact on the UK car industry from Brexit would be slow-burning. \u201cIt\u2019s never going to be immediate. You wouldn\u2019t wake up on 24 June [the day after the referendum] and say \u2018OK, that\u2019s the end of Sunderland\u2019. But what you would see is a gradual reduction,\u201d he said. \u201cIf a decision was taken that [a company is] not going to build model X in that particular plant, or potentially it was going to be split between two sites, then production capacity will go down. Your competitiveness may be affected, and then the next decision is taken, so it would be more like death by a thousand cuts rather than just shutting the gates overnight.\u201d Hawes said larger carmakers would always have alternatives but he hoped they would not be as attractive as the UK. The SMMT backed the remain camp in the run-up to the EU referendum, and Hawes said members were most concerned about possible tariffs being imposed on parts imported from the EU after Brexit. The average UK-built car has about 6,000 parts and the majority come from the EU. Hawes said parts could sometimes pass through four countries before reaching the UK. \u201cThe margins the industry operates on are wafer thin \u2026 so any tariff is immediately going to be a critical challenge to a company, especially when their competitors may not be subject to those tariffs.\u201d Hawes said SMMT members, which include parts suppliers and engine makers as well as the larger car manufacturers, were also fearful of the delays caused by additional customs checks on vehicles and parts once the UK is no longer a member of the EU. \u201cThe non-tariff barriers could be as punitive in cost as the tariff barriers. Anything that creates delay creates cost,\u201d he said. Hawes said he was encouraged by the broad message from the prime minister, Theresa May, and Greg Clark, the business secretary, after Nissan\u2019s decision to expand in Sunderland. \u201cThey have been at pains to reiterate that what the government is trying to do is make sure the UK automotive sector \u2013 not just Nissan \u2013 is competitive. We very much welcome that commitment.\u201d Nissan announced last week that it would build the next Qashqai and X-Trail models at its Sunderland factory, safeguarding more than 7,000 jobs, in the first major investment decision in the car industry since the Brexit vote. Nissan\u2019s chief executive, Carlos Ghosn, had been lobbying May\u2019s government for guarantees after the referendum. He said government support and assurances had led to the decision to expand in the north-east.",

      "bodyText": "The Bank of England is not much cop at forecasting what will happen to the economy. It proved as much before, during and after the financial crisis of 2008-09. But even by its own standards, it has got the post-referendum economy badly wrong. Three months ago when it announced a comprehensive package of measures to support the economy after the shock decision to leave the European Union, Threadneedle Street said it expected growth of just 0.1% in the third quarter of 2016 followed by no growth at all in the fourth quarter. If the Bank had been right, the UK would have been a whisker away from a technical recession in the second half of the year. Official figures from the Office for National Statistics show that the economy actually expanded by 0.5% between July and September, and the Bank now believes it will grow by a further 0.4% in the fourth quarter. Forward-looking business surveys support this assessment. In its quarterly inflation report, the Bank admits it has been taken aback by the resilience of consumer spending and by the strength of the housing market. That, together with a plunging pound, has been enough for its nine-strong monetary policy committee (MPC) to ditch plans for a fresh cut in interest rates before the end of the year. With a warning there are limits to the extent to which inflation at above the government\u2019s 2% target can be tolerated, the MPC has handed over responsibility for supporting the economy to Philip Hammond at the Treasury. Inflation is expected to average 2.7% in both 2017 and 2018 \u2013 higher than expected in August and the biggest overshoots since the Bank was made independent almost two decades ago. The Bank believes stronger growth than it envisaged in 2016 and 2017 will come at the expense of weaker growth later and that by the end of 2018 the economy will actually be slightly smaller than it predicted in August. Its critics \u2013 of whom there are a growing number \u2013 will say its inability to map the path of the economy since June means its forecasts for 2017, 2018 and beyond should be treated with a large pinch of salt. Some will say that growth of 0.5% and 0.4% in the two quarters following the Brexit vote means that the August measures \u2013 including a fresh cut in borrowing costs and additional money creation through the quantitative easing programme \u2013 were a mistake and that the stimulus will add to the inflationary pressure caused by the fall in the value of the pound. There is, though, a case for the defence. First, the Bank\u2019s August package has helped to support the economy. It helped to boost confidence and support activity. Second, the Bank\u2019s explanation for why growth can be expected to weaken during the course of 2017 and into 2018 without diving into recession looks reasonable enough. Both monetary and fiscal policy will underpin growth and the labour market has so far held up well. But although consumers are enjoying increases in their real incomes, living standards will be squeezed as a weaker pound leads to higher prices. What\u2019s more, the uncertainty over the timing and the terms of Brexit means firms are unlikely to be in any hurry to sanction fresh investment for the next couple of years. Even a stopped clock is right twice a day and for the Bank this might be one of those times.",

The company reported a near 6% rise in third quarter revenues and a 13.5% increase in earnings to $204.6m, helped by growing demand from airlines for its onboard wifi services and new government contracts. This offset continuing weakness in its maritime business. On Wednesday, the day before the results, British Airways owner International Airlines Group said it would Inmarsat\u2019s network to provide wifi on its short-haul fleets from 2017. Inmarsat had already signed up Lufthansa, Air New Zealand and another unnamed European carrier. But it said its fourth Global Express satellite would be delayed until 2017 following problems at SpaceX, the proposed launch partner where a rocket exploded in September. This would reduce capital expenditure this year from $500m-$600m to $400, to $500m, and the impact of the delay was yet to be determined. Chief executive Rupert Pearce said: Trading continues to be challenging, with economic and budgetary pressures affecting our customers generally. We are nevertheless competing aggressively and successfully in each of our core markets. The company\u2019s shares have jumped 71.5p or nearly 10% to 801.5p, and analysts at Credit Suisse issued an outperform rating: Inmarsat has reported a solid third quarter with (1) revenue 1% ahead of consensus as better than expected Government revenues offset weaker Maritime revenue; (2) a 7% EBITDA beat versus consensus; (3) a reiteration of both 2016 and 2018 revenue guidance; and (4) IAG yesterday confirming it intends to use Inmarsat for passenger connectivity on its short-haul European fleet. Three recen tmajor commercial airline announcements further boost future committed revenue. IAG (short-haul341aircraft), Air New Zealand and another European airline have all recently confirmed they will be using Inmarsat\u2019s GlobalXpress and/or European Aviation Network (EAN) for passenger connectivity. Added to three recent major Maritime deals, the recent US Navy contract win and three committed revenue deals in Government, Aviation &amp; Enterprise signed several years ago, we believe the airline announcements further underpin Inmarsat\u2019s 3-5 year growth outlook. Jefferies was also positive: Being a bear on Inmarsat feels increasingly difficult. Key legs of the bear thesis (cost inflation, relative competitiveness, revenue visibility, HTS - High-throughput satellite -cannibalisation of L-band) are successively getting kicked out from under it. The third quarter results were another (albeit, pretty big) milestone on this return to better sentiment. Even after today\u2019s move, we remain conviction buyers of the name. When you\u2019ve de-rated 40% because no-one believes your 2018 growth story any more, a 2016 quarterly print doesn\u2019t add much one way or another. But for the record, mobile satellite service revenue was +0.8% ahead of consensus, mobile satellite service EBITDA +7.2% ahead. Within the mix Maritime was soft (-4.2%) and Government was very strong (+13.1%)",

      "bodyText": "The UK services sector faced the biggest one-month jump in costs for 20 years in October in the latest sign that the sharp fall in the pound since the Brexit vote is starting to push inflation higher. The latest snapshot from the Markit/CIPS services PMI showed the sector \u2013 encompassing shops, hotels, bars and banks \u2013 grew at the fastest rate since January last month, beating economists\u2019 expectations. However, Markit\u2019s chief business economist Chris Williamson said the spike in firms\u2019 costs was \u201cthe ugly flipside of the weaker pound\u201d, which has fallen about 17% against the dollar since the Brexit vote. The input costs measure of the services PMI \u2013 an indicator of what companies are paying to buy products and raw materials \u2013 jumped to 64.9 last month from 58.9 in September, where anything above 50 signals a rise. It was the biggest monthly spike since the survey began two decades ago and the highest costs figure since March 2011. The headline measure of the services PMI rose to 54.5 in October, from 52.6 in September. Williamson said the survey suggested the broader economy was on track. Williamson said: \u201cAn encouraging picture of the economy gaining further growth momentum in October is marred by news that inflationary pressures are rising rapidly. \u201cIf sustained, the increase in prices threatens to curb both corporate hiring and consumer spending, as firms seek to reduce staff costs and households see their pay eroded by rising inflation.\u201d The official rate of annual inflation jumped to a near two-year high of 1% in September, and economists at the National Institute of Economic and Social Research are forecasting inflation will hit almost 4% in 2017. The UK service sector is crucial to national income, accounting for more than three-quarters of the economy. It includes restaurants, hotels and bars, as well as professional and business services. Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said services PMI, and equivalent surveys from the manufacturing and construction sectors published earlier in the week, suggested the economy was on track to grow by 0.5% in the fourth quarter, matching the rate in the third quarter. Tombs said: \u201cThe pick-up in the services PMI in October to its highest level since January signals that the economy still is showing little adverse impact of the Brexit vote, but the risk of a renewed relapse in growth, caused by rising inflation and corporate caution due to hard Brexit risks, remains high.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "HSBC could face trial for alleged tax fraud in France over the activities of its Swiss subsidiary. A French prosecutor has called for HSBC be tried for aiding tax fraud in France in a case that relates to files stolen by Herv\u00e9 Falciani, a former HSBC employee. The Guardian and other publications exposed the Falciani documents last year in a series of articles that showed how HSBC\u2019s Swiss banking arm helped wealthy customers dodge taxes. HSBC intends to continue to defend itself against the allegations, which date from 2005-07. The data was seized by tax authorities in 2008. If the case goes to trial, HSBC would face charges that its Swiss private banking arm helped customs to hide assets from the French tax authorities. Magistrates in France must decide whether to proceed with the charges. In a statement on Thursday, HSBC said: \u201cWe take note of the recommendation of the procureur de la R\u00e9publique financier in France and will continue to defend ourselves vigorously.\u201d HSBC has known since April 2015 that it had been placed under formal investigation when a \u20ac1bn bail was set. This was reduced to \u20ac100m at a later hearing. The bank said in a long list of legal disclosures attached to its six-monthly results in August that the ultimate financial impact could \u201cdiffer significantly\u201d from the \u20ac100m. It said: \u201cIn March 2016, HSBC was informed that the French magistrates are of the view that they have completed their investigation with respect to HSBC Swiss Private Bank and HSBC Holdings, and have referred the matter to the public prosecutor for a recommendation on any potential charges to be brought.\u201d At the time, it also disclosed that it was continuing to cooperate with the US Department of Justice and Internal Revenue Service into investigations into its Swiss arm and that in India. It also listed regulatory and law enforcement authorities in Belgium, France, Argentina and India as conducting investigations and reviews of HSBC Swiss Private Bank. In addition to France, HSBC said it had been placed under formal criminal examination by magistrates in Belgium. It also warned: \u201cIn light of the media attention regarding these matters, it is possible that other tax administration, regulatory or law enforcement authorities will also initiate or enlarge similar investigations or regulatory proceedings.\u201d",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The insurer RSA, best known for its More Than brand, is set to enjoy a profit boost from the pound\u2019s slide since the Brexit vote, while its pension fund has taken a hit. RSA generates 70% of its business outside the UK, largely in Canada, Ireland and Scandinavia, and the pound has declined by an average of 14% against those countries\u2019 currencies. Chief executive Stephen Hester, who had campaigned for the UK to remain in the EU, said the weaker pound would boost earnings, but added: \u201cIt\u2019s bad for the UK as a whole because we are poorer.\u201d The former Royal Bank of Scotland boss said: \u201cBrexit provides us an attractive tailwind from overseas earnings translation, in the context of an otherwise challenging environment. While the fourth quarter can be a bumpy underwriting period, RSA is on track for strong operating earnings increases for 2016 overall.\u201d Like other companies, the firm\u2019s pension fund has taken a hit due to low interest rates and the Bank England\u2019s extended bond-buying programme, announced after the June referendum to help the economy cope with the fallout. This has pushed bond yields lower and increased UK pension scheme liabilities. Hester said: \u201cThe widening of pension deficits has happened for all UK companies as a result of the Bank of England\u2019s accelerated quantitative easing programme.\u201d RSA\u2019s pension fund moved from a small surplus to a deficit of about \u00a3200m \u2013 \u201csmall potatoes\u201d compared with other companies\u2019 multibillion-pound shortfalls, Hester said. The insurer posted a 5% drop in net written premiums to \u00a34.8bn in the first nine months of the year after selling off operations in Brazil, Russia and Argentina. It is in the middle of a restructuring programme, with \u00a3250m cost savings targeted by the end of the year. The firm stepped up cost cutting after a failed \u00a35.6bn takeover bid from Zurich Insurance last year. With markets slow, Hester reiterated that RSA was relying on self-help. He took charge of the insurer two and a half years ago after a string of profit warnings and accounting irregularities at its Irish arm. Weather-related claims amounted to \u00a3145m, following wildfires in Canada in May and flash floods in the UK, France and Germany in June. RSA has a \u00a31bn portfolio of old asbestos claims going back decades, which it hopes to reinsure or sell, and is \u201cencouraged by the interest\u201d in the portfolio, Hester said. He boasted that the RSA\u2019s share price was the best-performing insurance stock in the world this year. Barrie Cornes, insurance analyst at Panmure Gordon, said this may not be such a good thing. \u201cThe share price has rallied well since we upgraded our recommendation to buy in the summer but on the downside we believe that in doing so it has materially reduced the possibility that the company will be bid for.\u201d Nicholas Hyett, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: \u201cProgress on costs and underwriting suggests the bottom line continues to improve. That more or less sums up Stephen Hester\u2019s vision for a slimmer more focused group. \u201cHowever, there\u2019s a limit to how far costs can be cut. Eventually the group will need to start growing its gross written premiums, and in the highly competitive, price driven world of commercial and personal insurance, that could well prove a challenge.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Leading shares are moving higher after their recent slide to a six week low, ahead of the latest interest rate decision from the Bank of England. Shire is heading the risers, a couple of day\u2019s after its results, following news of a disappointing result for a rival. A clinical trial of Roche\u2019s experimental haemophilia medicine, a potential competitor to Shire and Novo Nordisk, showed some patients suffering adverse effects. On the basis that bad news is good news for someone, Shire shares are up 179.5p at \u00a346.11. Liberum analysts said: What are the implications for Shire? We see a successful launch of [Roche\u2019s] ACE910 having an impact on Shire 2021 earnings per share of around 10-12% versus a scenario where ACE910 fails. In our bearish numbers (which still deliver 9% CAGR Shire earnings 16-21), we already assume this \u2018worst case\u2019. However, in our view consensus takes a more positive view for Shire given we have yet to see ACE910 P3 data. This news makes an ACE910 failure incrementally more likely, suggesting the stock should outperform [today]. Overall the FTSE 100 is up 22.10 points at 6867.52, as the Federal Reserve left US interest rates unchanged. But there is still caution as the US presidential race becomes too close to call in the run up to polling day. And a decision on whether the UK goverment will have to allow a parliamentary vote on Brexit will come from the high court shortly. Connor Campbell at Spreadex said: Caught between the subtle bullishness of last night\u2019s Federal Reserve meeting and the potential impact of the Bank of England\u2019s own get together, it is another overstuffed trading session this Monday. Add onto that the potentially huge decision, set to arrive at 10am, about whether or not Theresa May can trigger Article 50 sans parliamentary vote and it is easy to understand why things currently feel a bit jittery. Meanwhile Britain\u2019s service sector has recorded its fastest growth since January, but there were also signs of inflation building. With gold and silver edging down after their recent surge as Donald Trump appeared to be in the ascendency, Randgold Resources is down 400p at \u00a371.85 despite a 7% rise in third quarter production and Fresnillo has fallen 52p to \u00a317.28. But Dixons Carphone is up 10.2p to 336.6p after Morgan Stanley raised its rating from underweight to equal weight. The bank said: Dixons Carphone has derated significantly in recent months and consensus is no longer predicting much earnings growth in outer years. We believe, therefore, that the risk-reward trade off has become much more balanced, so upgrade to Equal-weight. Morrisons has risen 3.5p to 224.8p following its figures, helping Sainsbury to move 7.8p higher to 260.7p. Elswhere Gocompare shares are at 75.9p in the price comparison site\u2019s first day of dealing following its demerger from insurance group esure. Investors in esure received one new Gocompare share for each esure one they held. Esure is at 200p, meaning the total current price of 275.8p is higher than last night\u2019s close for esure of 265.8p. Peel Hunt analysts said: We maintain our hold recommendation but believe esure is now in a stronger position to boost shareholder returns. Nicholas Hyett, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: The demerger comes less than two years after esure took full control of the price comparison business. That leaves investors who held esure shares now also holding GoCompare shares, and that means holdings in two very different businesses. The remaining esure business is an established player in the motor insurance market. A tough sector, but one investors have historically looked to for its dividend potential. GoCompare, by comparison, is a high growth tech stock looking to expand into new markets.",

      "bodyText": "The debate over whether overdraft charges should be capped is being reignited by the City regulator, just months after a competition watchdog rejected the idea. The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) announced it would include overdraft fees in a review into high interest loans in its response to the Competition and Markets Authority\u2019s two-year investigation into high-street banks, which was completed in August. The CMA stepped back from imposing a cap on overdraft fees \u2013 which campaigners such as Labour MP Rachel Reeves argue cost more than payday loans \u2013 and instead said banks should publish their monthly maximum charge (MMCs) for going over the limit. In its response to the CMA\u2019s findings, which were published in August, the FCA said it was preparing to review \u201chigh-cost, short-term credit\u201d which will include overdrafts and other products such as payday loans and doorstep lending. Joanna Elson, chief executive of the Money Advice Trust, the charity that runs National Debtline, welcomed the move to look at overdraft charges again. \u201cThe CMA\u2019s proposed monthly maximum charges are a small positive step but are ultimately unlikely to make the difference required in bringing down the extremely high charges that many people in financial difficulty end up paying,\u201d she said. The CMA asked the FCA to look at various areas of its work, which the City regulator agreed to do. It will look at whether new rules are needed around the monthly maximum charges and also monitor the effectiveness of \u201cprompts\u201d, such as text messages, sent to customers before they go overdrawn. But it is also going further, not only by examining overdraft fees but also embarking on wider scrutiny of retail banking by analysing the impact of so-called \u201cfree-if-in-credit\u201d banking on consumers. Campaigners argue that free banking for customers who do not go overdrawn hides the cost of current accounts. Christopher Woolard, executive director of strategy and competition at the FCA, said: \u201cOur role in regulating retail banking markets goes beyond the remedies the CMA has asked us to take forward, and we will continue to look more broadly at how well these markets work, with a particular focus planned on high-cost credit including overdrafts. We will also be looking at wider retail banking business models,\u201d he said. The FCA will launch a call for evidence in the coming weeks. The FCA\u2019s remit is wider than the CMA\u2019s as it can also look at whether customers need protection. It has capped charges on payday loans at 0.8% per day of the amount borrowed since last year. The regulator said some campaigners had argued that unarranged overdraft fees \u2013 from which banks make \u00a31.2bn a year \u2013 should be set at the same level as arranged overdrafts. According to consumer body Which? the cost of borrowing \u00a3100 through an unauthorised overdraft for 28 days from some high street banks was as high as \u00a390. This is up to four times higher than the maximum allowed charges of \u00a322.40 on a payday loan. Gillian Guy, chief executive of Citizens Advice, said overdraft charges could quickly become unmanageable. \u201cAn unplanned expense that pushes someone into their overdraft by just a few pounds can lead to them being trapped in a cycle of daily charges.\u201d The CMA also looked at free banking and concluded it worked well for most customers. The FCA said it would now look at this area again. \u201cWe intend to undertake further work to better understand how firms\u2019 actions in one market may affect outcomes in another and how conduct and competition are affected by the links between different parts of the business model,\u201d the FCA said. The move was welcomed by new players attempting to break the stranglehold that the big four \u2013 Lloyds Banking Group, Royal Bank of Scotland, HSBC and Barclays \u2013 have on the current account market. There are 70m current accounts in the UK which generate \u00a38.7bn of revenue. \u201cThat the FCA feels the need to undertake further investigations into the practices of banks raises questions about the efficacy of the recent CMA investigation into current account competition. Why must we continue to wait for years for things to improve? This glacial pace of change is at odds with how customers and taxpayers alike expect to be treated,\u201d said Mark Mullen, chief executive of digital service Atom Bank. Alasdair Smith, who led the investigation by the CMA, appeared before MPs on the Treasury select committee on Tuesday and was forced to defend its conclusions, which focus on boosting competition by encouraging customers to compare their account details with rivals. Andrew Tyrie, the Conservative MP who chairs the select committee, said: \u201cThe FCA have acted quickly. It looks as if they may be prepared to pick up the baton which the CMA has just dropped\u201d.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The Bank of England\u2019s monetary policy committee will announce its latest policy decision on interest rates at midday on Thursday. Back in August, the MPC slashed its forecasts for growth and announced a package of measures to support the post-referendum economy. Interest rates were slashed to an all-time low of 0.25%; the Bank announced it would buy a further \u00a360bn of government bonds, expanding its quantitative easing (QE) programme to a total of \u00a3435bn; and plans to buy \u00a310bn of corporate bonds were revealed. Much has happened since August for the MPC to take into account. Theresa May announced she would trigger article 50 by the end of March, prompting a further sharp fall in the value of the pound. Official figures showed economic growth was stronger than the Bank expected in the months after the Brexit vote in June, with a 0.5% increase in GDP in the third quarter. Meanwhile, there are increasing signs that inflationary pressures are building as the impact of the weaker pound feeds through to higher import prices. As the next meeting nears, here is a reminder of what some members of the nine-member MPC have had to say since they last voted. Mark Carney, governor The governor has given little away on the likely path of interest rates. Much of the focus in recent weeks has been on his future at the Bank. Speaking on the subject of green finance in Berlin on 22 September, he made only a broad reference to the low interest rate environment. The Bank of England has long stressed that central bank policies are not the cause of low rates, but responses to them. We are actors in a play written by others. Long-run prosperity was never in the gift of monetary policymakers. As the 10th anniversary of the start of the crisis approaches, a consensus is growing that escaping this low-growth low-inflation trap will require a rebalancing between monetary, fiscal and structural policies. However, he told the House of Lords economic affairs committee on 25 October that the MPC would be taking into account the weak pound when it meets this week: We do not have a target for the exchange rate. We believe in flexible exchange rates. However, it is a factor that influences the stance of monetary policy \u2026 it is undoubtedly something that we will take into account over the next week, as we sit down, update our forecast and make our policy decision. Kristin Forbes, external member of the MPC Kristin Forbes suggested the Bank\u2019s decision to cut interest rates to 0.25% should be enough to prop up the UK economy following the referendum. Forbes voted for the rate cut at the MPC\u2019s August meeting but opposed the decision to expand QE and buy corporate bonds. Speaking at London\u2019s Imperial College on 22 September, she said: The economy is experiencing some chop, but no tsunami. The adverse winds could quickly pick up \u2013 and merit a stronger policy response. But recently they have shifted to a more favourable direction. Looking forward, I am not yet convinced that additional monetary easing will be necessary to support the economy \u2026 The fishermen in the boat need to stay vigilant, and may already be a bit seasick from the chop they have already encountered, but if the current weather continues, they should be able to sail home without more aid. Dame Nemat Shafik, deputy governor for markets and banking Dame Nemat Shafik appeared to take a different view to Forbes when she said the Bank would probably have to take more action if the UK was to avoid a damaging slowdown following the Brexit vote. Giving a speech at a Bloomberg event in London on 28 September, she said: There is no doubt in my mind that the UK is experiencing a sizeable economic shock in the wake of the referendum. It seems likely to me that further monetary stimulus will be required at some point in order to help ensure that a slowdown in economic activity doesn\u2019t turn into something more pernicious. Michael Saunders, external member of the MPC The MPC\u2019s most recent appointee said last month the UK economy was probably growing faster than his colleagues had expected in August. Speaking at the Institute of Directors in Manchester on 5 October, he stressed that he had not yet made up his mind on how he would vote at the November meeting. However, given his comments and the better than expected growth rate for the third quarter, it seems unlikely that he would back another rate cut at this time. I suspect the UK economy will be not too bad in the year ahead, with growth in 2017 more likely to be clearly above 1% rather than (as the consensus expects) below 1%. I am not going to give you a forecast of how I will vote [at the November meeting]. It will depend on the data. Compared to the central forecast of the August inflation report, my views imply that the economy has more slack but will also grow more strongly. My policy vote will probably depend on which of these factors is dominating. Ben Broadbent, deputy governor for monetary policy Broadbent said the Bank had been too pessimistic about the immediate aftermath of the Brexit vote, but warned of an \u201cinsidious\u201d threat to business investment. Speaking at the Wall Street Journal\u2019s London office on 5 October, he said: The central projection in the August inflation report didn\u2019t involve a recession, simply a slowing in the economy\u2019s rate of growth. But that slowing looks so far to have been more moderate than we feared. A lack of clarity about the UK\u2019s future trading relationships needn\u2019t result in visible, headline-grabbing closures of productive capacity. The effect is likely to be more insidious: decisions to expand, that might otherwise have been taken, are delayed.",

The Bradford-based supermarket chain continues its recovery, reporting a rise of 1.6% in like-for-like sales excluding fuel for the 13 weeks to 30 October. Like-for-like sales have been growing for a year. Morrisons cut its prices by 1% overall during the quarter \u2013 and introduced \u201cThe Best\u201d premium range with hundreds of products. It plans to launch more The Best products in the run-up to Christmas. The supermarket group decided to offer more Halloween products after listening to customers. This year\u2019s Halloween was its biggest ever, with sales up 20% year on year. Total sales excluding fuel fell 1.2% during the third quarter, reflecting the impact of supermarket closures and the sale of 140 M local convenience stores last year. The Morrisons chief executive, David Potts, said: \u201cThere is a lot more we plan to do. We will keep investing in becoming more competitive and improving the shopping trip, and I am confident we will serve our customers even better during the important trading period ahead.\u201d The era of price cuts at supermarkets may soon be over. Morrisons recently became the first supermarket to hike the price of Marmite, by 12.5%, along with other Unilever goods, after the Anglo-Dutch consumer goods company raised its prices by an average of 10% on a wide range of products. Unilever, one of the biggest suppliers to British supermarkets, blamed the slide in sterling since the referendum. This revived fears about food price rises as a result of the Brexit vote. Morrisons\u2019 new management team, most of whom hail from Tesco including Potts, \u201care making the right decisions but in the coming months they will be facing margin pressure from Brexit and national living wage margin pressure,\u201d said Phil Dorrell, partner at Retail Remedy consultants. \u201cMorrisons have productivity opportunities to pave their way but we are not sure they are best placed to be able to deliver the changes to achieve store efficiency without compromising the offer. \u201cOur prediction is that this will be the last cheap Christmas before prices are affected by inflationary pressure so we expect price to play its role in the Morrisons marketing message.\u201d",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The Pensions Regulator has begun formal legal proceedings against Sir Philip Green and Dominic Chappell that could force them to fill the \u00a3571m deficit in the BHS pension scheme, marking a dramatic escalation of the scandal surrounding the demise of the high street chain. The regulator said that after a \u201ccomplex investigation\u201d and months of talks with Green about a rescue deal for the pension scheme it was sending warning notices to the billionaire tycoon, Chappell and their companies. Lesley Titcomb, chief executive of TPR, said it was yet to receive \u201csufficiently credible and comprehensive offer\u201d to bail out the BHS pension scheme, which has more than 20,000 members, despite Green pledging to fix the problems facing it. The tycoon has rebutted TPR\u2019s claim, saying he had made a \u201ccredible and substantial proposal\u201d and shown he had cash available to support the pension scheme. Green said that his proposal would mean the BHS scheme avoids entering the Pension Protection Fund and be a \u201c better outcome\u201d for pensioners. The warning notices run to more than 300 pages and explain why TPR believes the parties are liable to make a financial contribution to the pension scheme and provide ongoing support. The notices mark the start of a so-called enforcement action against Green and his investment company Taveta, and Chappell and his consortium Retail Acquisitions. The action could end in a legal battle if Green and Chappell do not agree to TPR\u2019s demands. Frank Field, the Labour MP, said TPR had \u201clost patience with Sir Philip Green\u2019s excuses and empty promises\u201d. Field was the joint chair of the parliamentary committee that investigated the collapse of BHS, which concluded the department store chain had been systematically plundered by its former owners. BHS collapsed into administration in April, leading the loss of 11,000 jobs and leaving a pension deficit of \u00a3571m. Green controlled BHS between 2000 and 2015, during which time his family and other shareholders collected more than \u00a3580m. Green sold BHS in March 2015 to Chappell, a serial bankrupt with no retail experience, for just \u00a31. Retail Acquisitions collected an estimated \u00a317m from BHS despite owning it for just 13 months until it fell into administration. Green told Field\u2019s parliamentary committee that he would \u201csort\u201d the problems facing the BHS pension scheme in June when he appeared in front of MPs to answer questions about the collapse of the department store chain. However, no deal has been forthcoming and the billionaire tycoon was photographed on his new yacht throughout the summer. Last month the House of Commons voted unanimously to strip Green of his knighthood, which was awarded a decade ago for services to retail. During a fiery debate in parliament, Green was lambasted and described as a \u201cbillionaire spiv\u201d. TPR launched an anti-avoidance investigation into BHS in March 2015 after Green sold it to Chappell. It has trawled through nearly 100,000 documents and held talks with the parties involved. The warning notices sent to Green and Chappell are different, TPR confirmed. \u201cWe have been clear in our public commitment to make significant progress by the end of 2016 and the issue of these notices meets that commitment,\u201d Titcomb said. \u201cOur decision to launch enforcement action is an important milestone in our work to attain redress for the thousands of members of BHS schemes who have been placed in this position through no fault of their own. \u201cIssuing warning notices at this time reflects the outcome of our investigations and that we are yet to receive a sufficiently credible and comprehensive offer in respect of the BHS schemes. \u201cWe continue to pursue the best deal for members of the BHS pension schemes. If parties wish to approach us with settlement offers, that course remains open to them.\u201d In response, Green said: \u201cI have read the statement from the Pensions Regulator this evening and noted its contents. I have provided the regulator with what I believe to be a credible and substantial proposal, with evidence and bank confirmation of cash availability, which would prevent the scheme from entering the Pension Protection Fund. This is in order to achieve a better outcome for the BHS pensioners. \u201cI have also spoken to the chairman of the trustees who is supportive of the proposal on the basis that it provides members with better benefits than they would receive from the PPF. \u201cI believe the above statement confirms the statement of intent that I made in regard to the BHS pensioners.\u201d However, Field said he was not surprised by TPR\u2019s action. He said: \u201cHis answer throughout our inquiry was always that he was going to \u201csort\u201d the disastrous position he left the pension fund in when he sold off BHS to Dominic Chappell for \u00a31. We are glad to see TPR is now calling his bluff and instigating enforcement proceedings. It seems clear Sir Philip would rather kick the can down the road and avoid responsibility than come up with any fair, sustainable settlement for BHS pensioners.\u201d Business select committee chair Iain Wright said: \u201cIn June, Sir Philip told us he would sort out the pensions mess at BHS. Five months on, we\u2019ve seen Philip Green sunning himself on his yacht \u2013 his third \u2013 but no credible plan or cash on the table. \u201cHe is meant to be able to do deals quickly but he hasn\u2019t been keen to do a deal which would quickly end the misery for thousands of BHS pensioners. Sir Philip said he would sort it but he has not yet been true to his word. He has not come up with the money to satisfy the regulator, who has clearly and quite rightly now lost patience with his obviously empty promises.\u201d Clive Lewis, shadow business secretary, said: \u201cFour months after Sir Philip Green promised to make good the pensions deficit created by his shoddy management of BHS, and weeks after MPs voted unanimously to strip Green of his knighthood, tens of thousands of pensioners are still waiting to find out the fate of their pensions. \u201cLet\u2019s hope that, by stepping up their investigations, the Pensions Regulator will finally hold Philip Green to account and give those pensioners the security they deserve.\u201d",

During a fiery debate in parliament, Green was lambasted and described as a \u201cbillionaire spiv\u201d.</p> <p>TPR launched an anti-avoidance investigation into BHS in March 2015 after Green sold it to Chappell. It has trawled through nearly 100,000 documents and held talks with the parties involved. The warning notices sent to Green and Chappell are different, TPR confirmed.</p> <p>\u201cWe have been clear in our public commitment to make significant progress by the end of 2016 and the issue of these notices meets that commitment,\u201d Titcomb said.</p> <p>\u201cOur decision to launch enforcement action is an important milestone in our work to attain redress for the thousands of members of BHS schemes who have been placed in this position through no fault of their own.</p> <p>\u201cIssuing warning notices at this time reflects the outcome of our investigations and that we are yet to receive a sufficiently credible and comprehensive offer in respect of the BHS schemes.</p> <p>\u201cWe continue to pursue the best deal for members of the BHS pension schemes. If parties wish to approach us with settlement offers, that course remains open to them.\u201d</p> <p>In response, Green said: \u201cI have read the statement from the Pensions Regulator this evening and noted its contents. I have provided the regulator with what I believe to be a credible and substantial proposal, with evidence and bank confirmation of cash availability, which would prevent the scheme from entering the Pension Protection Fund. This is in order to achieve a better outcome for the BHS pensioners.</p> <p>\u201cI have also spoken to the chairman of the trustees who is supportive of the proposal on the basis that it provides members with better benefits than they would receive from the PPF.</p> <p>\u201cI believe the above statement confirms the statement of intent that I made in regard to the BHS pensioners.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/26/pensions-regulator-could-see-powers-expand-after-bhs-collapse\">Pensions Regulator's powers might be expanded after BHS scandal</a> </p> </aside>  <p>However, Field said he was not surprised by TPR\u2019s action. He said: \u201cHis answer throughout our inquiry was always that he was going to \u201csort\u201d the disastrous position he left the pension fund in when he sold off BHS to Dominic Chappell for \u00a31. We are glad to see TPR is now calling his bluff and instigating enforcement proceedings. It seems clear Sir Philip would rather kick the can down the road and avoid responsibility than come up with any fair, sustainable settlement for BHS pensioners.\u201d</p> <p>Business select committee chair Iain Wright said: \u201cIn June, Sir Philip told us he would sort out the pensions mess at BHS. Five months on, we\u2019ve seen Philip Green sunning himself on his yacht \u2013 his third \u2013 but no credible plan or cash on the table. </p> <p>\u201cHe is meant to be able to do deals quickly but he hasn\u2019t been keen to do a deal which would quickly end the misery for thousands of BHS pensioners. Sir Philip said he would sort it but he has not yet been true to his word. He has not come up with the money to satisfy the regulator, who has clearly and quite rightly now lost patience with his obviously empty promises.\u201d</p> <p>Clive Lewis, shadow business secretary, said: \u201cFour months after Sir Philip Green promised to make good the pensions deficit created by his shoddy management of BHS, and weeks after MPs voted unanimously to strip Green of his knighthood, tens of thousands of pensioners are still waiting to find out the fate of their pensions. </p> <p>\u201cLet\u2019s hope that, by stepping up their investigations, the Pensions Regulator will finally hold Philip Green to account and give those pensioners the security they deserve.\u201d</p>",
