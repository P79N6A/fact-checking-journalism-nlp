      "bodyText": "Vodafone's numbers, especially in Europe, still look horrible but the shares continue to do well. Has the market, assessing prospects in a post-Verizon Wireless world, over-dosed on chief executive Vittorio Colao's optimism? Probably not. There is a fair argument that life for Vodafone in Europe will get easier after the last quarter's hefty declines in service revenues (Germany down 7.9%; Italy 16.6%; UK 5.1%; Spain 14.1%). For a start, the regulatory bite, in the form of cuts to mobile termination rates, won't intensify. Then there's project spring, Vodafone's \u00a37bn splurge of extra investment to upgrade networks. The spending is necessary \u2013 Vodafone has been off the pace in driving new 4G technology \u2013 but this also looks to be a good moment to hit the accelerator. 4G customers are said to consume twice as much data as 3G punters. And Vodafone's major rivals do not have the equivalent of a large cheque from Verizon in their back pockets (remember, Vodafone is handing shareholders only 70% of the proceeds of the sale of the 45% stake). That is not to suggest the turnaround in revenues will arrive quickly. Italy and Spain are still rough markets and the competition in Germany will not stand still. But Vodafone's management now has time to breathe and capital to invest. The post-Verizon share consolidation will halve the dividend bill at a stroke, removing the annual struggle to cover the payment from non-Verizon earnings. There remains an outside risk that Colao will over-pay for somebody's cable business. On the other hand, shareholders know there is also a chance that AT&amp;T of the US or Softbank of Japan will offer a princely price for Vodafone itself. When the dividend yield is 5%, those odds are not so bad. Gissing got a move on It still seems remarkable that a 3% stake in loss-making Ocado can be worth \u00a390m, but, hey, who can argue with the collective judgment of informed investors? Certainly not the trustees of Jason Gissing's family trust. They flogged \u00a315.2m-worth of the shares on the day the co-founder announced his retirement. Very sensible too: the trust, and the Gissings, could probably benefit from some portfolio diversification, as the jargon has it. Even so, the haste looks a little indecent since Gissing won't actually leave Ocado's premises until May. Couldn't the trustees have waited? He's not any old investor.",

Has the market, assessing prospects in a post-Verizon Wireless world, over-dosed on chief executive Vittorio Colao's optimism?</p> <p>Probably not. There is a fair argument that life for Vodafone in Europe will get easier after the last quarter's hefty declines in service revenues (Germany down 7.9%; Italy 16.6%; UK 5.1%; Spain 14.1%). For a start, the regulatory bite, in the form of cuts to mobile termination rates, won't intensify. Then there's project spring, Vodafone's \u00a37bn splurge of extra investment to upgrade networks.</p> <p>The spending is necessary \u2013 Vodafone has been off the pace in driving new 4G technology \u2013 but this also looks to be a good moment to hit the accelerator. 4G customers are said to consume twice as much data as 3G punters. And Vodafone's major rivals do not have the equivalent of a large cheque from Verizon in their back pockets (remember, Vodafone is handing shareholders only 70% of the proceeds of the sale of the 45% stake).</p> <p>That is not to suggest the turnaround in revenues will arrive quickly. Italy and Spain are still rough markets and the competition in Germany will not stand still. But Vodafone's management now has time to breathe and capital to invest. The post-Verizon share consolidation will halve the dividend bill at a stroke, removing the annual struggle to cover the payment from non-Verizon earnings.</p> <p>There remains an outside risk that Colao will over-pay for somebody's cable business. On the other hand, shareholders know there is also a chance that AT&amp;T of the US or Softbank of Japan will offer a princely price for Vodafone itself. When the dividend yield is 5%, those odds are not so bad.</p> <h2>Gissing got a move on</h2> <p>It still seems remarkable that a 3% stake in loss-making Ocado can be worth \u00a390m, but, hey, who can argue with the collective judgment of informed investors? Certainly not the trustees of Jason Gissing's family trust.</p> <p>They flogged \u00a315.2m-worth of the shares on the day the co-founder announced his retirement. Very sensible too: the trust, and the Gissings, could probably benefit from some portfolio diversification, as the jargon has it.</p> <p>Even so, the haste looks a little indecent since Gissing won't actually leave Ocado's premises until May. Couldn't the trustees have waited? He's not any old investor.</p>",

      "bodyText": "A \u00a312bn scheme to build a series of tidal energy plants in Britain will be kickstarted on Friday as a planning application is submitted for the world's largest power-generating lagoon in South Wales. The promoters want to follow up an initial \u00a3850m project for Swansea Bay with four even larger lagoons with a capacity of 7,300MW \u2013 enough to meet 10% of the UK's electricity needs. Tidal Lagoon Power has put in a development consent order under the Planning Act 2008, but must convince the government to provide subsidies of \u00a3156 per MWh \u2013 even more than that going to offshore wind farms. The project must also overcome scepticism about tidal power following the collapse of the much-larger Severn Barrage power generator in the same region. \"Our intention is to supply 10% of the UK's domestic electricity by building at least five full-scale tidal lagoons in UK waters by 2023, before the UK sees any generation from new nuclear,\" said Mark Shorrock, chief executive of Tidal Lagoon Power, who has launched successful wind and solar schemes. The project, which envisages an area of 11.5 sq km cordoned off by a breakwater, would have an installed capacity of 320MW with an annual output of 420GWh and a design life of 120 years. A 9.5km sea wall up to 20m high would need to be built, but Shorrock says only a little over half of this wall would be visible from the land at low tide, and barely a few metres showing at high tide. The power will be generated as the incoming and outgoing tides \u2013 the daily equivalent of 100,000 Olympic swimming pools worth of water \u2013 pass through turbines. Shorrock it was essential to build more than one tidal lagoon: \"Economies of scale bring immediate advantage. A second lagoon will require a lower level of support than offshore wind, for a renewable power supply that is both long-lived and certain. \"A third lagoon will be competitive with the support received by new nuclear, but comes without the decommissioning costs and safety concerns,\" he added. The second project would cost \u00a32.3bn and be based in Colwyn Bay, with a third costing \u00a34bn located in the upper Severn estuary. Two more at a cost of \u00a34.5bn would follow, on as-yet-unspecified sites. Shorrock, who has already constructed 280MW of wind and solar plants, says he has potential financial backing from the Macquarie Group's infrastructure funds and would like to bring in UK pension funds as investors. He says the projects would be far cheaper and more productive than the \u00a330bn Severn Barrage scheme which was first turned down by the government in 2010 amid huge opposition from many environmentalists. The renewable energy entrepreneur says he has support from the local community and leading green activists for the Swansea Bay tidal lagoon, which as well as providing light and warmth for 120,000 local homes could also become a centre for sailing and other recreation. Sean Christian, special sites spokesman for the bird and wildlife lobby RSPB, said he welcomed the fact that energy projects in the Severn estuary were now focused on tidal power lagoons rather than the more damaging shore-to-shore barrages. \"This technology will have less impact on fish and other wildlife than the barrage proposals, which conservationists have spent several years fighting in the estuary, and which the government has repeatedly rejected. \"However, it could still have major impacts on the estuary and its wildlife, and we will need to look at the details of each lagoon proposal closely. \" Tidal Lagoon Power has already built a potential team of British-based suppliers who would help with the scheme, including Alstom, Sheffield Forgemasters and Atkins. The equivalent of 1,850 full-time jobs are promised in the construction phase. David Tonkin, chief executive for the UK and Europe at the engineering company Atkins, said: \"The tidal lagoon concept represents a bold new addition to the energy mix. It is a great example of how innovative engineering could be used to harness our natural resources and provide clean, sustainable and predictable power for thousands of homes. If given the go-ahead for planning and the subsidies, construction of the Swansea Bay lagoon is slated to begin in the first half of next year, with the first power being generated in 2018. It would also be a major boost to local employment opportunities, especially while it is being constructed. Ian Isaac, who runs NSA Afan, a community-based regeneration organisation, said: \"Swansea Bay tidal lagoon will be the first of its kind in the world and will make a statement for vision of future Welsh industry. Importantly, it will be an innovative approach to tackling high levels of unemployment in the area.\" \u2022 This article was amended on 7 February 2014.

The plea came as an influential committee of MPs criticised the scheme, which would apply to shopping bags handed out by English retailers, but exempts stores with fewer than 250 employees as well as paper and biodegradable bags. MPs said in its current form the charging scheme would be \"less effective\" than a simpler 5p bag tax introduced in Wales in 2011 which has helped reduce bag use by 75%.

Not the Fed of Ben Bernanke and Janet Yellen but the Fed of the early 1930s.</p> <p>Here\u2019s the lowdown. Central banks such as the Fed and the Bank of England learned lessons from the Great Depression, a disaster caused by a shrinking of the money supply exacerbated by austerity. Since the crash of 2008-09 both the Fed and the Old Lady have flooded their economies with cash in an attempt to offset the drying up of bank credit. In both Washington and London there has been a recognition that seeking to hit budget targets in a low-growth environment by cutting spending or raising taxes simply makes matters worse. There is an acknowledgement that Keynes lived.</p> <p>Europe has done things differently. It has not responded to the shrinking of credit in the aggressive manner of the Fed or the Bank of England. There has been no quantitative easing, no funding for lending schemes, no attempt to clean up the balance sheets of troubled banks. Slow growth has led to calls for already mouth-wateringly tight fiscal policy to be toughened up. The message has been that macro-economic policy is only of limited importance and that supply side reforms are the answer. The do-nothing decision by the European Central Bank yesterday came as no surprise.</p> <p>But Europe\u2019s experiment is doomed to fail. Weak money and credit growth plus austerity will result in the weak euro zone recovery being aborted, sooner rather than later if the emerging market crisis intensifies. Deflationary pressures will intensify. In the not-too-distant future, Mario Draghi, the ECB\u2019s president, will be able to insist on a more aggressive monetary policy. Why? Because the internal ECB battle is between Draghi, a man who thinks macro-economic policy matters and the Bundesbank, a central bank that thinks economic history ended in 1929....</p> <p><i>And that\u2019s a good moment to stop.

This relates to the SMP programme which sees the ECB buy a troubled nations\u2019s debt to bring down its borrowing costs. Because of strict rules prohibiting the ECB from monetising governments, the amount spent on the SMP has to be \u201csterilised\u201d \u2013 the sum spent on SMP has to be withdrawn from the EZ system normally weekly.</p> <p> This is unlike in the UK and US where QE has injected trillions into the banking systems. Ending the liquidity drain would add almost \u20ac180bn to Euro system.

Another option would be to start charging banks who leave funds with the ECB, imposing negative interest rates on them in a bid to drive more credit into the system.</p> <p>Another option is to end the process \"sterilising\" the bond purchases which the ECB made earlier in the crisis -- basically deciding to stop taking money out of the system to balance the funds which it had put in. That would create an infusion of liquidity, and there have been signals this week that Germany's Bundesbank would support the idea.</p> <p>If that's all too dramatic for the ECB today, Draghi could make some dovish noises about easing policy in future. At Davos last week he (re)floated the idea of securitising loans to small European firms (<i>bundling them together into new securities</i>). Perhaps we'll hear more about that, <b>at 1.30pm GMT</b>.<br></p> <p><b>The Bank of England </b>is unlikely to provide any drama, given its existing forward guidance that the jobs market isn't strong enough to support an interest rate rise.

Not the Fed of Ben Bernanke and Janet Yellen but the Fed of the early 1930s. Here\u2019s the lowdown. Central banks such as the Fed and the Bank of England learned lessons from the Great Depression, a disaster caused by a shrinking of the money supply exacerbated by austerity. Since the crash of 2008-09 both the Fed and the Old Lady have flooded their economies with cash in an attempt to offset the drying up of bank credit. In both Washington and London there has been a recognition that seeking to hit budget targets in a low-growth environment by cutting spending or raising taxes simply makes matters worse. There is an acknowledgement that Keynes lived. Europe has done things differently. It has not responded to the shrinking of credit in the aggressive manner of the Fed or the Bank of England. There has been no quantitative easing, no funding for lending schemes, no attempt to clean up the balance sheets of troubled banks. Slow growth has led to calls for already mouth-wateringly tight fiscal policy to be toughened up. The message has been that macro-economic policy is only of limited importance and that supply side reforms are the answer. The do-nothing decision by the European Central Bank yesterday came as no surprise. But Europe\u2019s experiment is doomed to fail. Weak money and credit growth plus austerity will result in the weak euro zone recovery being aborted, sooner rather than later if the emerging market crisis intensifies. Deflationary pressures will intensify. In the not-too-distant future, Mario Draghi, the ECB\u2019s president, will be able to insist on a more aggressive monetary policy. Why? Because the internal ECB battle is between Draghi, a man who thinks macro-economic policy matters and the Bundesbank, a central bank that thinks economic history ended in 1929.... And that\u2019s a good moment to stop. Back tomorrow to cover the main events, including new US employment data.... Good night. GW While most stocks have risen today, Twitter\u2019s share price has received a vicious plucking after last night\u2019s financial results left Wall Street unimpressed. From New York, Dominic Rushe reports: Twitter\u2019s share price dropped more than 20% Thursday morning as investors reacted to news of slowing growth. On Wednesday, after the stock markets closed, Twitter published its first quarterly earnings report since going public. The company made more money in the last three months of 2013 than analysts expected. However, the social network also announced it had 241m users at the end of 2013, just 9m higher than the previous quarter. Chief executive Dick Costolo also disclosed that, in the last quarter of 2013, the number of \u201ctimeline views\u201d \u2013 Twitter\u2019s equivalent of page views, and a key measure for advertisers \u2013 dropped for the first time in the company\u2019s history. The shares crashed during after-hours trading and continued to fall as the stock markets opened Thursday. Twitter share price tumbles further after news of slowing growth Failed to mention this earlier - Ghana joined the ranks of emerging markets to raise borrowing costs, with a 200 basis point rate hike this afternoon. That takes its main policy rate up to 18%, in a bid to underpin its currency, the cedi. Analysts had expected a 100bp raise, but governor Henry Kofi Wampah said a steeper increase was needed, because: The uncertainties in the outlook and weakened domestic fundamentals underscored the need for continued tight fiscal and monetary policies and measures that will reduce the country\u2019s vulnerability to shocks, re-anchor inflation expectations and sustain macro economic stability.\u201d Over in Athens...... Risk is back in fashion in Europe\u2019s stock markets, with a surge in share prices this afternoon driving markets higher. The Footsie closed exactly 100 points higher, a gain of 1.55%. The Italian market was the best performer, up 2.2%, with almost every index from Amsterdam to Athens rising (the Russian MICEX was the only faller). Here\u2019s the details: And the euro remains higher too, after the ECB failed to deliver a rate cut or suggest that radical measures to help the eurozone economy were imminent. It\u2019s still up around 0.5% today at $1.36 - reflecting the fact that Mario Draghi was less dovish than some had expected. Michael Hewson of CMC Markets comments: After spending most of the session rising on anticipation of an ECB rate cut, and then dropping briefly when no cut came, European markets rallied higher anyway after ECB President Draghi appeared to indicate that only the complexity of the current situation in Europe had prevented action this month, that there was no deflation risk, and that the picture could become clearer in March, with the possibility of some action then. Some fairly good jobless claims numbers from the US also helped raising expectations ahead of tomorrow\u2019s eagerly awaited US employment report. While I was watching Draghi, Simon Nixon of the WSJ was analysing today\u2019s report claiming the Netherlands would do well to quit the eurozone (as flagged up earlier). He\u2019s not impressed: Just chatted with Frederik Ducrozet, Credit Agricole\u2019s senior economist for the eurozone, who says there was \u201cnothing new\u201d in Mario Draghi\u2019s various answers (and non-answers) about whether the ECB could embark on quantitative easing. During the press conference, the ECB president confirmed that the rules of the Maastricht Treaty do not prevent the ECB buying government bonds in the \u2018secondary market\u2019 -- but that\u2019s not a significant change, Ducrozet argues, saying There\u2019s nothing new in what Draghi said in answer to the questions on quantitative easing today.... We knew it could buy bonds in the secondary markets as we saw with the SMT programme [in 2011 and 2012]. Draghi seemed to spend much of the press conference tip-toeing around the QE issue, trying to neither rule it in or out. As the Telegraph\u2019s Ambrose Evans-Pritchard put it neatly: Frederik Ducrozet also expects more clarity in the next ECB staff forecasts next month -- probably showing inflation under target in 2014-2015, and then a return towards target in 2015-16. That could pave the way to a small cut to interest rates in March,of perhaps 0.1% points. Here\u2019s his latest research note following the ECB meeting, in which he exaplins: Draghi was still dovish, \u201cfirmly reiterating\u201d the ECB\u2019s forward guidance commitment while pledging to take \u201cdecisive action\u201d if needed. However, Draghi was not more dovish than last month, contrary to market expectations, nor did he hint explicitly at new rates or liquidity measures to come. Euuugh. Bloomberg reports that the Ukraine government held an unscheduled debt auction this afternoon - and didn\u2019t raise the money it was looking for. Stock markets are romping ahead this afternoon, as a new bout of optimism hits trading desks. Today\u2019s fall in new US unemployment claims has calmed fears over the American recovery - sending the Dow Jones industrial average up 142 points, or 0.9%. In London the FTSE is ending the day on a tear, up 96 points or 1.5% in late trading.... The euro has also hit its highest level of the year against the pound, up as much as 0.6% to a five-week high of 83.5p. The IMF has just given the Federal Reserve a nudge not to ignore the impact of its \u2018tapering\u2019 on the rest of the world - rather echoing Mario Draghi\u2019s points on this issue earlier. It\u2019s not a rebuke, though. Reuters has the story: The International Monetary Fund on Thursday urged central banks to keep in mind the consequences their actions have on other countries, echoing the recent calls for greater monetary policy coordination. \u201cIn this increasingly interconnected world, the actions of one country obviously have impacts and consequences for others,\u201c IMF spokesman Gerry Rice told reporters.Indian central bank governor Raghuram Rajan last week said the United States in particular should focus on the global impact of the drawdown in its massive monetary stimulus. But Rice said the U.S. Federal Reserve clearly communicated its recent decision to start reducing its monthly bond purchases. Marc Ostwald of Monument Securities describes today\u2019s event as a \u201cholding meeting\u201d from the ECB, and isn\u2019t convinced that we\u2019ll see any action next month either. He writes: Conclusion: a policy move in March is possible, but the probability appears to well below 50%, especially given that the ECB is very unsure which systemic and / or economic vulnerabilities it should, or rather needs to, take most immediate action about. Market impatience with the ECB is likely to grow, but much will depend on how high the current \u2018wall of worry\u2019 becomes. All eyes now turn to tomorrow\u2019s US labour report. That was not the most exciting or enlightening event in the history of the ECB. So what came out of it (\u2019highlights\u2019 start here)? The ECB is playing for time. You know it\u2019s not a great press conference when the main act apologises for giving overly long answers. Draghi can be a great performer -- today\u2019s sometimes rambling replies, often repeating points he made last month, suggest he didn\u2019t have much new to say. \u2022 They\u2019ve prepared the ground for March. Draghi\u2019s defence for leaving rates unchanged today, and for not launching any new measures, is that the ECB will have new economic forecasts in time for next month\u2019s meeting. He says the ECB could still take \u201cdecisive action\u201d, with all possible instruments at its disposal. If the ECB cuts its inflation forecasts again, it could provide the impetus for a rate cut or some other decisive move. A four-week delay also gives the emerging market turmoil chance to calm down (or become a full-blown crisis, in which case we could see co-ordinated action from the world\u2019s central bankers again). \u2022 But there\u2019s no certainty they\u2019ll do much in March. The euro is now a cent higher than when Mario Draghi appeared clutching a hefty pile of paperwork, rising steadily as traders listened to the ECB president trundle on (Faisal Islam rather nailed it with his \u2018boreward guidance\u2019 pun on Twitter). Sebastien Galy of SocGen reckons the ECB is trying to sit tight, saying: The ECB still doesn\u2019t want to pull the trigger on more easing hoping past easing will be enough. \u2022 It also doesn\u2019t want to talk about quantitative easing. It took three questions before Draghi would actually give a straight answer -- that monetary financing isn\u2019t allowed under the eurozone treaties. \u2022 The ECB stands firm on deflation. Draghi refuses to accept the theory that the eurozone is sinking, remorselessly, into the quicksand of falling prices, entrenched stagnation and mass joblessness. We are not Japan, he insists. \u2022 He\u2019s got sympathy for emerging markets over the Fed\u2019s tapering. Draghi\u2019s right, Raghuram Rajan is an excellent economist - facing a tough job at the Indian central bank as the Fed slows its stimulus programme and lures money out of emerging markets. Draghi\u2019s warm words -- including that he looks forward to a chinwag with Rajan about the EM situation at the next G20 -- look like a show of support. And finally, vice-president V\u00edtor Const\u00e2ncio takes a question on the stress tests - explaining that banks can also use hybrid securities* to meet the capital requirements set out in the \"adverse scenario\" used in the tests. (one for aficionados) Asked to clarify his point about how each central bank has its own mandate, Draghi explains that central bankers can discuss policy co-ordination as long as it doesn't rule out complying this mandate. Did the ECB consider buying equities at today's meeting? No, we're not at that point yet, Draghi smiles. Draghi confirms that the ECB could buy government bonds in the secondary markets without violating the eurozone treaties. It already did so, with its SMT programme (which helped prevent Italian and Spanish borrowing costs spiralling out of control in 2011 and 2012). German politicians are upset that eurozone members would have to rotate their voting power once Lithuania joins the euro area. That could leave the Bundesbank without a vote at a crucial moment. What's Draghi's take? Mario Draghi replies that it's not up to him, it's a matter for politicians. And anyway, it all depends what the treaties say. Next question -- would Draghi be so relaxed about inflation if it was running at above 3%, not below 1%? I don't have a cool attitude at all, Draghi hits back. I've said these low rates are a threat to the recovery. We can still claim to have a symmetric attitude to inflation. Draghi is also asked about last week's claim by the Indian central bank chief, Raghuram Rajan, that the US Federal Reserve is acting in a 'selfish' manner by tapering its bond-buying programme, and destabilising emerging markets as capital flows back to the US. Another long answer, but Draghi does offer some support to Rajan - calling him an \"excellent economist\" , who he's looking forward to catching up with at the next G20 meeting. He may have some good ideas, Draghi adds. And he returns to the point about central bank mandates - pointing out that the Fed has a 'dual mandate' (price stability and low unemployment). Good question -- would Draghi and the ECB support co-ordinated action at the next G20 meeting to help the financial markets through the current volatility? Draghi acknowledges that there has been talk about co-ordinated action since a central bank in \"one jurisdiction\" began creating spillover effects (he means the Federal Reserve, of course). But he explains that co-ordinated action can be hard to enforce, because central bank has its own institutional set-up -- \"the job is always to comply with the mandate\". So problems come if a bank acts in a way that isn't compliant with such a co-ordinated action, because of the pressure to stick to its mandate. Central banks already have measures to share information -- we could potentially improve on that. Draghi claims that the markets now have a better understanding of its 'reaction function'. The euro has risen since it became clear that that ECB isn't announcing any new measures today -- it's now back up at $1.36 against the US dollar, gaining a whole cent as Draghi has played a straight bat with a series of drawn-out answers. * - Draghi admitted a few minutes ago that one answer was too long Draghi ducks a question on that long-running question about whether the Irish government will get some retrospective help over its bank bailout. The next questioner also asks Draghi about the legality of QE -- the press pack want an answer on this one. Draghi responds: All instruments allowed by the treaty are eligible. And the treaty forbids monetary financing. We know what's eligible and what isn't. And on the question about Draghi's comments about QE at Davos, he delves into that big pile of paperwork to check what he said at the WEF. The key issue is the bank lending channel, he said -- pointing out that credit flows in the eurozone have almost stabilised at the end of last year. That's encouraging. And the ECB's Asset Quality Review (where it shakes the region's banks hard and sees what nasty things drop out) may be hitting credit in the short term as banks raise capital, but in the medium-term it will be good for lending, he argues.. And re Davos -- the point he was making there is that a 'vanilla' securitisation programme could be set up to package and sell loans to small firms. I don't think he answered the question about the legality of QE..... Yes, that wasn't a typo -- the ECB's new forecasts will present predictions on a two-year horizon. Not everyone's convinced: That deflation answer wasn't long enough for the WSJ's star correspondent Brian Blackstone, who homes in on exactly why the ECB is waiting for more data. Does that mean monetary easing is simply delayed until next month? Blackstone also wants Draghi to explain why he said at Davos that the rules banning monetising government debt in the euro area meant the ECB couldn't embark on quantitative easing. Draghi says that the ECB wants to conduct more analysis because of the \"complexity of the situation\", and the fact that the ECB will have new forecasts running up to 2016, early in March. The governing council wants to see how the emerging market volatility plays out. They also want to wait for GDP data for the last three months of 2013. This is a long answer on deflation (is Draghi playing for time?!) - the ECB president also points out that most of the deflation is seen in the four 'programme' countries (where deep austerity has driven prices and wages down). He concludes that the ECB will have more evidence of the situation next month. Draghi adds that the ECB is looking for signs that investment is being deferred (which would suggest people expect deflation), but doesn't see any evidence yet. Next question -- what impact would the worsening eurozone inflation outlook rate have on interest rates, and when might you consider ending 'sterilising' your previous bond-buying programme (a move that would increase liquidity in the system)? Draghi takes them in reverse order -- saying that the ECB considered a broad range of measures (update: although ending sterilisation wasn\u2019t specifically discussed). Which instrument it uses depends on the conditions faced by the bank. And on inflation, he says the ECB took action in November when it cut rates, which will take times to fully feed through. Draghi also insists (again!) that the eurozone will not slide into deflation (a self-feeding drop in prices in several countries). We don't see a repeat of the situation in Japan, he said. The ECB sees a protracted period of low inflation, not full-blown deflation. He adds that the recent drop in inflation is partly due to lower energy costs, and points out that the recovery is \"still fragile and still uneven\". The first question, from CNBC -- is on the emerging markets. What has caused the current volatility, and what might the ECB do to protect the eurozone? Draghi says the governing council talked about which factors could make the possible risks from emerging markets crystallise, adding: So far, the eurozone economy and financial markets have shown a good deal of resilience to these developments. Much more resilience than eight or nine months ago. That's a reference to the market wobble last summer when the Federal Reserve came close to slowing its bond-buying stimulus programme. This time, Draghi says, the ECB's forward guidance is providing reassurance (was that a small pat on the back for the governing council?) Draghi concludes his statement with the usual warning that eurozone countries must not 'unwind' recent progress on fiscal reforms. It's important to implement 'growth-friendly' strategies that make structural reforms without hampering economic recovery, he adds. Now onto questions -- i'll post a link to the statement shortly. Loans to non-financial businesses continued to contract, Draghi cautions -- a sign that credit still isn't flowing well in the euro area. Weak loan dynamics for non-financial businesses continue to reflect their lag to the wider recovery and credit risks, he says. The general funding condition of eurozone banks is another factor, says the ECB president --- which is why we need banking union. Inflation risks are broadly balanced, Draghi says. Another key line -- the risks to the eurozone recovery remain on the downside, Draghi adds. And he goes on to cite the risk of \"uncertainties in emerging markets\", which could affect future economic conditions . Weaker than expected domestic demand, weak exports, or failure to make structural reforms in some eurozone countries are also risks, he adde. Draghi firmly reiterates the ECB's forward guidance, that rates will maintain at their current record levels, or lower, for an extended period. He says the eurozone faces a prolonged period of low inflation, adding that \"We are monitoring developments closely\". All available instruments are on the table. We could take further decisive action if required, he adds. Mario Draghi brought in a lot of paperwork with him.... Mario Draghi's up and running, saying that the moderate recovery in the eurozone is continuing in line with its expectations. But inflation pressures are weak, and credit availability is subdued. While we wait for Mario, the latest US jobs data is out - showing that 331,000 people filed new jobs claims last week - 4,000 fewer than expected. Back to Frankfurt, where the ECB press conference is about to start. It's being streamed live here. Bloomberg TV will also carry a live feed. Mario Draghi will start by reading a prepared statement, in which he could possibly announce new measures to stimulate lending. He'll then be questioned by the press pack. Back in the UK, former Bank of England rate-setter Andrew Sentance isn't impressed with today's crop of MPC members after seeing them leave interest rates and QE unchanged again. Educated readers will recognise the Yes Prime Minister reference.... Economist Nouriel Roubini also expects the ECB to relax its monetary policy in a month's time, in response to the signs of deflation in the eurozone. The euro had quite a wobble when the ECB's decision hit the wires, jumping then tumbling in a trading heartbeat before settling down around 0.2% around the $1.350 mark. Nick Matthews, economist at Nomura, reckons the ECB's governing council may have come close to cutting interest rates today, telling Reuters: \"Unchanged rates was our expectation today, though we suspect it may have been a close call and may disappoint some.\" Justin Wolfers, professor of economics and public policy at the University of Michigan, is most unimpressed that the ECB left monetary policy unchanged. With unemployment at record highs and inflation well below its target of just below 2%, the ECB had every excuse to cut, he suggests: The euro is falling, despite the European Central Bank deciding not to cut interest rates, now down a third of a cent at $1.3499. Traders are calculating that Mario Draghi will suggests some further easing of monetary policy soon, at the looming press conference: All eyes will be focused on Mario Draghi's press conference, in around 35 minutes, where the ECB president could give some hints about how the central bank could act in the months ahead. We might also find out whether any members of the governing council pushed for a rate cut today, or some other stimulus measures. Here's some instant reaction to the ECB decision in the meantime: Breaking: The European Central Bank has voted to leave interest rates across the eurozone unchanged at their record low of 0.25%. It has also resisted imposing negative interest rate on eurozone banks, leaving the deposit rate unchanged at 0.0%. And the marginal lending rate (which banks pay to borrow from the ECB) is also unchanged. Here's the official (brief) statement: At today\u2019s meeting the Governing Council of the ECB decided that the interest rate on the main refinancing operations and the interest rates on the marginal lending facility and the deposit facility will remain unchanged at 0.25%, 0.75% and 0.00% respectively. The President of the ECB will comment on the considerations underlying these decisions at a press conference starting at 2.30 p.m. CET today. The European Central Bank decision is just a couple of minutes away. Over on CNBC, Danny Gabay of Fathom Consulting is arguing that the ECB should plunge into full-blown quantitative easing (even though it's far from clear that this could be allowed under its mandate) Meanwhile, one of the largest criminal trials ever held over the collapse of a financial institution continued in Dublin today, as three former Anglo Irish Bank executives appeared in court for the second day. From Dublin, Henry McDonald reports: The crisis that was engulfing Anglo Irish Bank in the year of the 2008 financial crash forced executives to hold an unprecedented 33 board meetings in that period, a Dublin court heard today. Natasha Mercer, a one time company secretary at the now defunct bank, told the trial of Anglo Irish bosses Sean Fitzpatrick, Patrick Whelan and Wiliam McAteer, that normally the bank held between 8 to 10 board meetings per annum. But such was the extent of the panic infected the bank that they were meeting on average more than twice a month in 2008, the court was told. Earlier the 15 strong jury was shown graphs on computer screens of how the shares in the bank were in \"very clear decline\" in 2008. On St Patrick\u2019s Day of 2008, there was a significant drop in the price to \u20ac6.95. This coincided with the failure of Bear Stearns Bank, the court heard. But by the summer the price of a share in Anglo had fallen to \u20ac5.95. It went below \u20ac5 for the first time about July 10th. It went back up after July 17th and hovered around the \u20ac5-\u20ac6 mark during August. But by September 24th, the price had dropped to \u20ac3.98. It was at \u20ac2.03 on September 29th. The Anglo Irish trio are charged with providing unlawful financial assistance to 16 named individuals in 2008 - the year the bank was later rescued by the Irish and European taxpayers. Fitzpatrick, Whelan and McAteer pleaded not guilty to all the charges against them. Across the City, traders and economists are scampering for a quick sandwich or suchlike before the European Central Bank announces its own decision on monetary policy, in around 20 minutes (12.45pm GMT or 1.45pm Frankfurt time). Ilya Spivak, currency analyst at DailyFX, says the markets are in \"chipper mood\" ahead of the ECB's decision: The central bank is under pressure to deliver additional easing as disappointing CPI inflation data and sinking inflation expectations feed deflation fears and challenge the central bank\u2019s mandate to maintain price stability. As flagged up earlier in the blog, the ECB has plenty of options -- including cutting interest rates, or imposing negative rates on bank deposits. Another option would be to copy the Bank of England's Funding for Lending scheme, to drive down credit costs in the euro area, Spivak added. David Kern, chief economist at the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC), says the Bank of England made the right call, and should now reshape its forward guidance on when interest rates might eventually rise: \u201cGiven the global uncertainties, and the still delicate state of the UK economy, the decision to hold both interest rates and QE was uncontroversial and appropriate. As British business has enjoyed the added stability and confidence that has come with the forward guidance policy, the speculation favouring an early interest rate rise is unhelpful and potentially damaging for the economy. \u201cWhile the essence of the forward guidance strategy is to reassure businesses that interest rates will be kept as low as economic conditions will allow, the MPC should use next week\u2019s Inflation Report to place its policy on firmer foundations. Linking forward guidance exclusively to unemployment has proved counter-productive. Focusing instead on a range of key indicators would increase its effectiveness, reinforce business confidence, and pour cold water on the cynicism that many city analysts have demonstrated. Here's some instant reaction to the Bank of England's no-change in interest rates, and no statement on monetary policy: The Bank of England has voted to leave UK interest rates at 0.5% -- maintaining borrowing costs at the record low set way back in March 2009. There's also no change to its quantitative easing programme, which remains at \u00a3375bn. And there's no statement -- hardly a surprise given we get the quarterly inflation report next week. Just five minutes until the Bank of England announces its monthly monetary policy decision..... European stock markets have rallied through the morning -- with lunchtime looming, the main indices are up at least 1%. Construction firm Vinci is leading the risers on the FTSEurofirst 100, after reporting better-than-expected results on Wednesday. It's being closely slip-streamed by Daimler (which raised its operating profit forecasts this morning) and Volvo (after announcing fresh job cuts) Albert Edwards, the famously bearish City analyst, and his team at SocGen have produced an interesting graph showing how corporate profits from the emerging market sector have recently now lagging behind the equivalent in developed economies. Another sign of a slowdown, or worse, in the EM world? The Dutch far-right leader, Geert Wilders, has raised the political temperature ahead of this spring's European parliament elections, by releasing a study showing the Netherlands' economy would grow faster if the country quit the EU. The FT has the story: Geert Wilders, leader of the far-right Freedom Party (PVV) that is leading in Dutch polls for May\u2019s European parliament elections, presented a study on Thursday that claims the Netherlands would be better off if it left the EU and urged voters to support his call for \u201cNexit\u201d. The study, by the consultancy Capital Economics, claims the Dutch economy would quickly emerge from its current sluggishness to brisk growth, generating billions of euros \u2013 or new Dutch guilders \u2013 in fresh revenues for debt-laden Dutch households. \u201cLeaving the EU or Nexit will not only restore our national sovereignty but it will also boost the Dutch economy now and in the future,\u201d Mr Wilders said in The Hague. \u201cIt also offers the Netherlands a way out of the crisis\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009Nexit will create jobs; the income of our citizens and companies will grow.\" The Netherlands finally left recession last autumn, but still faces wide-ranging austerity measures as the government tries to bring its deficit below the EU's 3% target. Carsten Brzeski of ING reckons that the 0.5% drop in German industrial orders in December is encouraging news: Here's his reasoning: German new orders have been on a zig-zag trend for almost two years. In this regards, today\u2019s decline is actually good news. Why? Recently, strong monthly increases were always followed by strong declines the month after. Today\u2019s small drop confirms the upward trend for the German industry. Order books are gradually filling. Combined with the low level of inventories, industrial production should gain more momentum in the coming months, hopefully closing the current wide gap between euphoric confidence indicators and rather sluggish hard data. Meanwhile in France, the president's popularity continues to hit new lows according to new polling today - with fewer than one in five people saying they support Francois Hollande. German manufacturing orders dropped unexpectedly in December, due to a slump in domestic demand. Germany Economy Ministry just reported that industrial orders fell 0.5% during the month, with domestic orders sliding 1.6% month-on-month. Foreign orders, though, rose 0.4% - thanks to a 7.5% surge in new business from the eurozone. So rather than Germany stimulating its neighbours' economies, it looks like the rest of the eurozone gave its largest member a lift in December. Or as the Economy Ministry put it: It is especially pleasing that the strongly rising orders from the euro zone signal the recovery continues apace. On a two-month basis (the less volatile measure), total new orders were up 1.1%. Speaking of banks, one of Northern Ireland's so-called 'pillar banks' (the victim of a huge robbery nearly a decade ago) has made a dramatic turnaround in its fortunes. Henry McDonald has the details: The Danske Bank made a pre-tax profit of \u00a311.4 million in 2013, the company said. This compares to losses of more than \u00a358 million in the previous year and is the first time since the financial crash of 2008 that the bank has gone into profit. The improved performance was driven by reduced bad loan charges alongside a better underlying business. Danske is one of the top three banks for customers in the region and used to be known as the Northern Bank. The one time locally owned bank was first taken over by an Australian bank and then by its current Danish owners. As the Northern Bank in 2004 its Belfast headquarters close to City Hall became the focal point of the biggest bank robbery in UK criminal history when the Provisional IRA staged a \u00a326m heist. No one has ever been convicted in relation to the robbery, which almost killed off hopes of a peace deal between republicans and unionists. However the bank along with the other major financial institutions in Northern Ireland lost far more in the lending-spree that fuelled the property boom on both sides of the Irish border prior to the 2008 global crash. City analyst Louise Cooper points out that Mario Draghi may not be too alarmed by the current low inflation rates in Europe, given they are the product of austerity programme pushed, in part, by the ECB: Draghi and his contemporaries have wanted price falls in the periphery countries to \u201crestore their competitiveness\u201d. And it is happening. She agrees that an interest rate cut might make little difference to bank lending or growth, and might also \"smack of desperation\". It might make more sense to boost the money supply, by ending the 'sterilization' of the ECB's previous bond-buying rescue plan (it mopped up some Italian and Spanish debt in 2011 and 2012 to prevent borrowing costs soaring). But it might be challenged in the German courts. Here's why: Draghi has reportedly been seeking German support to get rid of Bond Sterilization. This relates to the SMP programme which sees the ECB buy a troubled nations\u2019s debt to bring down its borrowing costs. Because of strict rules prohibiting the ECB from monetising governments, the amount spent on the SMP has to be \u201csterilised\u201d \u2013 the sum spent on SMP has to be withdrawn from the EZ system normally weekly. This is unlike in the UK and US where QE has injected trillions into the banking systems. Ending the liquidity drain would add almost \u20ac180bn to Euro system. That would be a big boost to money supply and could counteract deflation. Bloomberg reports that \u201cThe Bundesbank supports ending the liquidity absorption and has deliberated on the measure in the ECB\u2019s monetary-policy and market-operations committees\u201d. To end the liquidity drain on the SMP would be a big change for ECB policy (and could be challenged by the German constitutional court). As well as the ECB's meeting, Frankfurt will also be hosting Greek finance minister, Yannis Stournaras, today. The visit comes a day after it emerged that the eurozone was considering extend Greece's debt repayments as part of a third aid package. The Kathimerini newspaper reports: Greek Finance Minister Yannis Stournaras heads to Frankfurt on Thursday, where he will meet Bundesbank and Deutsche Bank officials, with the discussion about further debt relief for Greece having apparently been rekindled. Finance Ministry sources admitted on Wednesday that talks about extending the maturities on eurozone loans to 50 years had been \u201con the table for the past few months.\u201d The admission came after Bloomberg reported that two people with knowledge of the discussions said the option was being debated. Twitter gave the markets a nasty surprise last night when it reported limited growth in new users and a drop in timeline views. Joao Monteiro, analyst at Monex Capital Markets, reckons this could cause wider jitters when trading begins in New York: Expectations are that Wall Street will be able to shake off some of those losses from yesterday at the open, although the markets' reaction to Twitter's earnings last night is certainly telling and could well end up weighing across the broader sector. Many of these stocks are trading at a premium that is simply unsustainable. The ECB rate verdict - and more likely Mario Draghi's press conference - could serve up some additional direction ahead of the open. The European economy is certainly struggling and consumers need some impetus to get out there and spend what money they have. Failure to acknowledge this could give traders another reason to look for safety. And here's the graph that spooked investors, sending Twitter shares down almost 18% in after-hours trading. Along with new cars (see 9.17am), Britons continue to flock towards another perennial favourite, housing stock. Halifax reports that house prices rose 1.1% month-on-month in January, reversing the 0.5% decline seen in December, as demand continue to outstrip supply. More here: House prices return to growth in January, says Halifax Anyone getting carried away by talk of the European economy recovering should check out today's results from mobile network giant Vodafone, which reported a 10% tumble in sales across the region. Southern Europe was particularly tough - organic revenues shrank 14% in Spain and over 16% in Italy. Chief executive Vittorio Colao warned: \"The environment in Europe remains challenging and we have continued to experience intense macroeconomic, regulatory and competitive pressures in the quarter.\" Colao is pinning his hopes on 4G services, which support faster connections and high-quality video (assuming economic conditions allow people to pay for them) Britain's love affair with new cars continues -- the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders reports that sales rose 7.6% year-on-year last month. After jumping 11% to a six-year high in 2013, vehicle sales remained solid in January. However the SMMT still expects a more modest expansion this year. Analysts believe last year's jump in demand was due, in part, to easy credit terms and the windfall from PPI mis-selling payments. Deals where customers drive away a new car but don't actually own it are also popular at the moment -- helping to push sales up. The SMMT reported: 2013 confidence continues into January: 154,562 new cars registered, up 7.6%. Buyers attracted by fuel efficiency; typical new car 27% more efficient than seven-year-old model. Alternatively-fuelled vehicle registrations increase 25% over January 2013. 2014 set for more moderate growth than 2013. Kit Juckes, Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale's foreign exchange strategist, doesn't expect the ECB to cut borrowing costs today, although others in the City suggest an unusual 0.15% cut to the headline refinancing rate. He predicts more talk than action today: Against a backdrop of very low inflation and a lack of any credit growth at all, there is every reason to ease further. Sadly, absent deflation and in the face of improving economic data, procrastination and token easing are more likely than real action. We look for no move, while there is a significant minority in the market expecting a further 15bp shift down in the Refi to 0.1%. Most economists expect more half-promises of further action the press conference and more easing in the months ahead. The euro is flat against the US dollar this morning, bobbing around the $1.352 mark. European stock markets have risen in early trading, but there's a sense of caution as traders wait for the ECB's announcement at 12.45pm GMT, and then Mario Draghi's press conference 45 minutes later. The main indices are all positive, although the FTSE 100 is up just 11 points. It is being dragged back by AstraZeneca (-3%), which warned investors that the loss of lucrative patents on high-margin medicines will hit sales and profits this year. Generic rivals to its Nexium drug (for heartburn and ulcers) should hit the markets in May. There's better jobs news in the UK this morning -- Derby's Bombardier train making plant has won the \u00a31bn contract to supply rolling stock to Crossrail (an ambitious project to link areas east and west of London with a train line running under the capital). The only train building factory in Britain fought off competition from Japan's Hitachi and CAF of Spain to supply 65 trains for the line. It had warned that its factory in Derby, which employs 1,500 people, could have closed if it hadn't won the Crossrail contract (just to clarify, Bombardier are a Canadian firm, but with UK operations) More here: Bombardier UK wins \u00a31bn Crossrail contract Thousands of jobs are also going at Volvo as the truck maker tries to boost its own profitability. The world's second largest truck maker has more than doubled its layoffs target to 4,400 (including 2,000 redundancies announced last year). The axe will fall on white-collar jobs in truck-making divisions, along with sales, marketing, IT, HR and finance roles. The blow was announced as Volvo reported a 37% drop in profits in the last three months of 2013. Sales had picked up in the US, but it saw a slowdown in Europe as new emission rules kicked in. Earlier this morning, Sony confirmed rumours that it will spin off its computing and television operations -- and also hit its workforce with the news that 5,000 jobs will be cut. Reuters has more details. The news was prompted by falling demand for PCs, leading to squeezed profits -- apparently manufacturers make just $15 of operating profit per computer. Sony's latest results, also announced this morning, confirmed that profitability is a challenge - it now expects to lose 110 billion yen (around \u00a3665m) this year, not the 30 billion yen profit it was aiming for. Today's ECB meeting is particularly enticing as economists really aren't sure what Mario Draghi and the rest of the governing council will decide today. Dubbing Draghi the \"Master of Suspense\", Bloomberg points out that ECB has wrong-footed many investors in the past (few expected November's rate cut). As Nick Kounis, head of macro research at ABN Amro Bank NV in Amsterdam, put it: There is a powerful case for the central bank to do more, and there\u2019s a high chance they will ease policy somehow. That may not be through a rate cut. Credit Agricole's economist Frederik Ducrozet is also rubbing his hands, although he reckons policy changes will come next month. Analysts at Commerzbank reckon that a rate cut will come soon enough, even if not today: We are still convinced that, on a medium-term perspective, core inflation will turn out much lower than the ECB currently assumes. As a result, the central bank is likely to eventually cut its key rate once more. And CNN has pulled together 3 reasons European Central Bank may cut rates: The risk of deflation -- with prices rising at just 0.7% annually in January Shaky growth outlook -- Europe may be recovering, but recent turbulence in emerging markets and some disappointing US and Chinese data have Market volatility -- Recent investor nervousness has been felt by Europe's banks, pushing up the overnight interbank interest rate Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of events across the financial markets, the world economy, the eurozone and business. Central bank meetings dominate the agenda today. The European Central Bank's governing council are meeting in Frankfurt to discuss the state of the eurozone economy, and the Bank of England's MPC corralling in the depths of Threadneedle Street to set UK monetary policy. And there's speculation that Mario Draghi could - or at least should - produce a rabbit from his presidential hat, in response to the deflationary pressures and weak growth stalking the euro area. A cut in headline borrowing costs isn't out of the question, although it's not clear whether it would really address Europe's problems. Another option would be to start charging banks who leave funds with the ECB, imposing negative interest rates on them in a bid to drive more credit into the system. Another option is to end the process \"sterilising\" the bond purchases which the ECB made earlier in the crisis -- basically deciding to stop taking money out of the system to balance the funds which it had put in. That would create an infusion of liquidity, and there have been signals this week that Germany's Bundesbank would support the idea. If that's all too dramatic for the ECB today, Draghi could make some dovish noises about easing policy in future. At Davos last week he (re)floated the idea of securitising loans to small European firms (bundling them together into new securities). Perhaps we'll hear more about that, at 1.30pm GMT. The Bank of England is unlikely to provide any drama, given its existing forward guidance that the jobs market isn't strong enough to support an interest rate rise. But there's always the chance that it might release a statement.... Ahead of these meetings, we're expecting Europe's stock markets to bounce back after recent losses. Asia 's bourses have been calmer, with the Australian market rallying 1.2% and the South Korean index up 1%. Europe could follow: And there's plenty of important corporate news around this morning, including big job losses at Sony and Volvo (of which more in a moment....)",

But by allowing banks to create electronic money, it has lost hundreds of billions of potential revenue \u2013 and taxpayers have ended up making up the difference. These changes could also reduce household debt. In the current system, new money is only created when banks lend. Banks will only lend if someone is willing to go into debt. That is why the government wants to fuel growth by encouraging more household borrowing. But with household debt at its highest level in history, any further increase could lay the foundations for another financial crisis. Only the Bank of England has the ability to create new money without having to wait for someone to go into debt. Banks would still exist, as providers of current accounts (which would hold money created by the Bank of England, rather than an uncertain IOU from a bank), and as middlemen between savers and borrowers. But they would lose the ability to create new money in the process of lending. The idea of removing banks from their role as creators of the nation's money will strike many as radical. But it is surely more radical to entrust the same banks that caused the financial crisis to create the money on which the rest of the economy depends.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Sales of small, fuel-efficient cars jumped in January as cash-strapped consumers sought to cut the costs of motoring, according to the latest industry sales figures. Hybrid cars that use electric batteries to supplement their petrol engines also showed strong growth as sales across the industry increased 7.6% on a year ago. The Ford Fiesta maintained its four-year dominance over the Focus to retain the accolade as Britain's best-selling car, followed in third place by the Vauxhall Corsa and VW Golf and Polo brands. The largest car in the top 10 was the Nissan Qashqai, which has a reputation for being one of the most fuel efficient in its class. The Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) said January saw a further push by consumers to increase the fuel efficiency of their cars. Mike Hawes, the SMMT's chief executive, said: \"As fuel economy is a major consideration for many motorists, ongoing investment by vehicle manufacturers in innovative, fuel-efficient technology is a key factor in the growing demand for new cars. Looking ahead, the UK automotive industry expects to see moderate, sustainable growth in 2014.\" Carmakers sold 154,562 vehicles last month compared with 143,643 a year ago, giving the industry a lift after 2013's bumper sales. This was a 23rd successive monthly increase and followed an overall increase of 10.8% in 2013 when registrations reached a six-year high of 2,264,737. Hawes noted that alternatively fuelled vehicle registrations, a category which is dominated by hybrid cars, increased 25% over January 2013. Howard Archer, chief UK economist at IHS Global Insight, said private new car sales led the way, rising 17% year-on-year in January, supported by a combination of rising consumer confidence, a buoyant jobs market, cheap finance deals, and motorists' desire to buy more fuel efficient cars given relatively high petrol prices. He said: \"The motor industry will be hoping that recent robust UK economic activity is sustained and extended, and that this underpins consumer and business confidence, and their willingness to splash out on new cars. \"Car manufacturers and garages will certainly be very pleased to see that consumer confidence jumped to a 76-month high in January, with consumers' opinion of the climate for making major purchases rose sharply in January to be at its highest level since December 2010. In addition, markedly rising employment is supportive to car sales. But he added a cautionary note, saying consumers were still strapped for cash while wage rises remained below inflation. \"The squeeze on consumers' purchasing power has so far only eased modestly as, while consumer price inflation has come down, earnings growth is yet to see any meaningful pickup,\" he said.",
