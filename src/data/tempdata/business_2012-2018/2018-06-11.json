      "bodyText": "The British economy is showing the greatest signs of stress since the eurozone crisis and fears of a double-dip recession six years ago, as worrying reports show the steepest fall in manufacturing output and the greatest degrees of pessimism among employers since 2012. Concerns over Brexit and a slowdown for high street spending are among the major factors contributing towards 2018 being the worst time in six years for British firms planning to take on new staff, according to a closely watched survey compiled by the recruitment firm ManpowerGroup. Watched by the Bank of England and the government for early warnings of hiring spurts or downturns, the quarterly poll of about 2,000 major employers from nine different industry sectors across the UK found a net balance of only 4% planning to hire more staff rather than cutting back. The weakest outlook from the survey was reserved for the banking and finance industry, which recorded the worst outlook since the depths of the financial crisis almost a decade ago, suggesting job cuts may be on the way over the summer. The barometer of hiring sentiment comes as Britain\u2019s factories unexpectedly recorded the sharpest drop in output for more than five years in April, amid falling demand for steel and electrical machinery. Pointing to fewer orders for steel used in infrastructure projects and a wider slowdown in demand for British goods at home and abroad, the Office for National Statistics said manufacturing output fell by 1.4% in April from the previous month. Economists had forecast modest growth of 0.3%. The figures are likely to stoke concerns the UK economy is reaching its lowest ebb since the Greek debt crisis of 2012, a year when George Osborne was booed at the London 2012 Paralympics as the coalition government pushed through austerity measures with damaging consequences for living standards. Official figures showed Britain fell into a double-dip recession in the first months of that year, although the downturn was later revised away to show growth was flat in hindsight. Although the situation does not appear to be as severe this year, forecasts issued by the National Institute of Economic and Social Research on Monday suggest the UK has done little to bounce back from heavy snowfall earlier in 2018, when the \u201dbeast from the east\u201d caused a sharp drop in output. Putting the growth rate for GDP at only 0.2% in the three-month period to May, up from 0.1% in the same period ending in April, Niesr\u2019s head of UK macroeconomic forecasting, Amit Kara, said: \u201cEconomic growth has slowed materially since the start of this year and it continues to remain weak.\u201d According to the ONS, overall industrial output in April \u2013 which includes the figures for manufacturing, alongside the utilities and mining industries \u2013 dropped by 0.8% compared with the previous month, led by the fall in factory production and similar declines for energy supply and water usage. Ministers are likely to be worried by the picture the figures paint for the state of the British industrial sector, with the steel industry facing mounting pressure from US import tariffs. Industry insiders fear the tariffs could rekindle the crisis of two years ago, when a glut of Chinese imports threatened to bankrupt British producers. The figures could also make it harder for the Bank of England to raise interest rates from as early as August, although observers point out that factories account for only around 10% of the economy. They also show the UK\u2019s trade position with the rest of the world deteriorated further in April. Britain\u2019s trade in goods deficit, which is the difference between products sold abroad and imported to the UK, unexpectedly widened by about \u00a32bn to reach \u00a314bn \u2013 the biggest monthly gap since September 2016.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The purchase of Battersea Power Station, the biggest property deal in the UK, is under threat after the leader of Malaysia\u2019s governing coalition said it would be investigated as part of \u201cdubious\u201d investments made by the previous administration. On a visit to London to meet British ministers, Anwar Ibrahim, who leads the recently elected Pakatan Harapan, said a series of deals paid for by Malaysian sovereign funds and pension funds had to be looked at again and renegotiated if there were any wrongdoing. In January, Permodalan Nasional Berhad, a state fund, agreed to buy a direct stake from other Malaysian shareholders in the power station next to the Thames, valuing the building at \u00a31.6bn. The site, which will be home to Apple\u2019s new UK headquarters, is in the process of being acquired by Malaysian state entities. In an interview with the Guardian, Anwar, who was released from prison after the opposition won power for the first time in Malaysia, said the previous government had used the savings of ordinary people to cover up the multibillion-dollar embezzlement scandal at 1MDB, a state investment fund. \u201cAll these deals which are considered dubious, including investments in housing in London, will have to be investigated. Yes, that includes Battersea. Because they were made using state funds. We have to be convinced that this was the right investment decision and that there was no political influence or direction [within Malaysia],\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s clearly a political decision to invest. If there is something wrong then we will want to renegotiate. We are looking at umpteen deals extending to hundreds of billions of ringgit \u2013 that is tens of billions of dollars. \u201cYou look at every deal from housing in London to railways built by China. It\u2019s baffling to me and I was monitoring the policies of [the former prime minister] Najib [Razak] and attacking him ferociously. But even I am shocked to the extent he seems to have gone to to earn more to cover up the 1MDB fiasco.\u201d Najib denies any wrongdoing. The current government said more than $4bn (\u00a33bn) was stolen from a government fund, with an alleged $681m ending up in Najib\u2019s personal bank account. There has recently been a series of raids on Najib-linked properties in which 284 Hermes handbags and 72 bags of cash, watches and jewellery were seized. Anwar\u2019s comments will raise questions about the British government\u2019s commitment to fighting corruption. He said the money trail of the 1MDB fraud ran through London, with $1.83bn of Malaysia\u2019s cash funnelled into a Saudi-British company. \u201cThere was no attempt by British authorities to investigate. But this was a crime using sovereign wealth funds for reckless spending sprees. I am seeking support from the British government and from the foreign secretary, Boris Johnson,\u201d he said. \u201cI say to Britain: you talk about transparency and anti-corruption drives, now is the time for action. I am saying now allow the institutions to conduct investigations fairly and give the necessary cooperation.\u201d Anwar pointed out that in Singapore, people have gone to prison and banks have been closed down for their role in laundering 1MDB cash. \u201cLook, the last Malaysian government did not want the British to be involved. But we are now giving them a mandate to investigate,\u201d he said. The opposition leader spent nine years in prison on charges that he insists were politically motivated, having been jailed on two occasions, including in 1999 by Malaysia\u2019s prime minister, Mahathir Mohamad. Anwar said he trusted Mahathir to pursue their shared reform agenda and had forgiven him. \u201cI will be returning to politics soon. I always refrained from giving a timeframe to my return because it would render the prime minister\u2019s position as untenable. He would be a lame duck. What I want to give him is my full support to make tough decisions with the full force of the law,\u201d he said. The Battersea project is 17 hectares (42 acres) and includes more than 4,000 new homes. Malaysian state-owned companies are the developers of the other five phases of the project, which is due to be completed by 2028. When contacted, the Battersea Power Station Development Company said it had no comment to make. A government spokesperson said: \u201cThe UK has a robust legal and regulatory framework which enables effective investigation of suspected money laundering, corruption and the recovery of illicit assets, and we continue to work closely with international partners to stem the flow of illicit wealth.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The past two years have been a very good demonstration of the importance of the public sector in keeping the economy growing when the private sector is weak. Since the start of 2016, the public sector has almost been as vital to the economy as during the global financial crisis, and demonstrates yet again that governments do create jobs and economic growth. Something odd happened to the narrative of the Australian economy over the past year. After the end of the investment phase of the mining boom, the story was that the switch had clearly been made towards more export-oriented growth. It made sense. Once we got through the wild swing of the GFC years, the contribution of exports to our economic growth continued to rise. By September 2016 it was contributing 1.3% pts to GDP growth \u2013 the highest recorded for over 15 years. But since then, rather surprisingly, it has fallen: Now this doesn\u2019t mean that the export phase is over \u2013 indeed the expectation is that export growth will pick up. But it highlights how little our economic growth is dependent upon exports, and how subject our exports are to weather (cyclones are not good for our exports) and international economics winds. Historically the biggest driver of our economy has been domestic demand \u2013 spending by households and the public sector and investments by the private and public sector. Through 2015 and 2016 the contribution of exports to our economic growth was almost on a par with that of domestic demand, but that was as much a reflection of how weak domestic demand was as it was about how strong export growth was: So in some ways, while decline in importance of exports is counter to the narrative of the export boom, it fits with the historical picture of our economy. In many ways this is good \u2013 if only for our nerves. GDP figures are mostly reported in the media in seasonally adjusted terms (for no good reason), but the chart of seasonally adjusted exports can look a bit like a heart monitor, so it is probably good that we are not overly reliant on them to gauge every three months how we are tracking: But while it is not unusual that we are once again reliant mostly on domestic demand, the makeup of that demand is not typical. When we look at the breakdown of how domestic demand is contributing to our economic growth we see that through 2016 and 2017 public spending \u2013 both consumption and investment has become more important than in the three years beforehand. Household consumption remains the biggest factor (not surprising given it accounts for 60% of the economy) but its importance remains relatively flat and subdued. Similarly during 2016 and 2017 the private sector side of investment was actually detracting from economic growth \u2013 because of the sharp fall in mining investment: The importance of the public sector spending \u2013 mostly in health, aged care, the NDIS and infrastructure \u2013 is apparent when we take away the contribution of the public sector from GDP growth. This doesn\u2019t give us precisely the \u201cprivate sector\u201d GDP, but it is a good proxy. Currently our GDP is growing in trend terms at 2.7% \u2013 nicely in line with the peaks of growth over the past six years. But once we take away the public sector\u2019s contribution, the economy is only growing at 1.7% - below the peak periods of growth of the past half dozen years: Now there is nothing wrong with this \u2013 in fact it is a prime example of how you would want public spending to work. It is essentially just a longer and less urgent version of the stimulus spending the Rudd government did during the GFC, done this time not because the world economy was going down the drain, but because mining companies had finished building a lot of their mines. From September 2012 to September 2016, the level of private sector capital expenditure on buildings and structure, and machinery and equipment fell 35%: That is a massive chunk to take out of the economy \u2013 and had the government not reacted with increased spending and investment, we wouldn\u2019t be arguing about why things are so middling given generally stable unemployment rate, but instead why the economy is so utterly stuffed. As it is however, the contribution of the public sector does explain some of the weak wages growth given public health and social care jobs are generally lower paying, and even the income in construction work is less for public infrastructure than it is for work to build a mine. One very good thing however is that we do seem to have reached the bottom of the mining investment fall. There has been now five quarters straight of rising private sector investment, and the latest estimate for investment in 2018-19 suggests a slight improvement over this year, driven mostly by the non-mining sector: A large part of the non-mining investment growth has been in building and structures, especially in the electricity, gas and water industry: It all adds up to a picture where the economy is still pretty weak, but there are some signs that the weakest is behind us. Certainly the anchor on growth that has been falling mining investment looks to be finally unshackled. But the private sector growth remains well below historical average growth \u2013 especially when it comes to household spending. It must be rather ironic for those free marketeers in the government who raved and ranted against stimulus spending during the GFC to have to admit that their government\u2019s own spending and that of state governments is very much ensuring that the economy is continuing to tick along. \u2022 Greg Jericho is a Guardian Australia columnist",

The energy regulator has launched a review that is likely to result in a reversal of the last major shake-up of rules 15 years ago, which was designed to encourage competitors to take on the big six companies that dominate the UK market. There are 66 suppliers and the new, smaller players have taken about a fifth of market share, up from 1% six years ago. Ofgem\u2019s review of the licensing regime for electricity and gas suppliers comes after it barred one small company, Iresa, from taking on new households because of customer service failings. Two smaller suppliers have collapsed in the past two years, forcing Ofgem to appoint other companies to take on their thousands of customers. Consumers have benefited from the competitive pressures, Ofgem said, but low entry barriers and more players was putting companies and customer service standards at risk. The changes under consideration include new tests on the financial health of prospective suppliers, and more regular checks on existing energy companies. Comparison sites and consumer groups welcomed the review, saying it should strengthen protections for consumers and was unlikely to harm competition. Emma Bush, the energy spokesperson at uSwitch.com, said: \u201cIt\u2019s right that the requirements for market entry are kept under review to ensure they remain fit for purpose and provide consumers with the protection they need.\u201d Martin Lewis of MoneySavingExpert.com said: \u201cWe want new suppliers but we have to know they\u2019re viable. This is a public good. There should be some barriers to entry.\u201d Last month, 35% of the 500,000 switches that households made between suppliers were from the big six to small and medium-sized rivals. It has caused headaches for the likes of British Gas, which lost 823,000 customer accounts in four months last year and is in the process of cutting 4,000 jobs. Two of the other big suppliers, SSE and npower, are merging in response to the competition from new entrants. While some small suppliers have faced customer service problems, many others have been praised for their service. The top six energy companies in a recent customer service poll were all small suppliers, with the top slot taken by Octopus Energy. While the big six have all recently put up prices, one of the fastest-growing challengers said on Monday it would hike prices for nearly half a million customers for a second time this year. Bulb said an average home would pay \u00a348, or 5.1%, more each year, and blamed the increase on wholesale costs rising a fifth since February.",

      "bodyText": "Cabin crew at Ryanair in the UK will be represented by a union for the first time after Unite signed a recognition agreement with the airline. About 650 staff working from Ryanair\u2019s UK bases could be covered by the deal, with the union able to represent them in talks on pay, hours and holidays. The news follows similar agreements with two Italian cabin crew unions five days ago, when the airline said it hoped to sign more recognition deals in the coming weeks. The rights for crew came after months of talks following Ryanair\u2019s announcement late last year that it would recognise unions \u2013 a move prompted by a shortage of pilots that caused a wave of cancellations. It has struck deals with pilots\u2019 unions across Europe, including Balpa in the UK, but securing similar agreements for crew has taken longer. Many crew members remain indirectly employed via agencies such as Crewlink and will not come under the remit of the Unite deal. Working conditions at the airline have been scrutinised, with aspiring crew members having to pay thousands of pounds to train to work for Ryanair, as well as facing sanctions for not hitting sales targets onboard. Unite, which represents more than 25,000 cabin crew across airlines operating from the UK, said it had secured full consultation rights and collective bargaining for Ryanair\u2019s employees, from whom three union representatives will be drawn, with paid time off for union duties. The Unite general secretary, Len McCluskey, said it was a \u201chistoric agreement and a significant step by Ryanair\u201d, and urged all crew to join the union. \u201cFor the first time ever, Ryanair\u2019s UK cabin crew will have a recognised union in their corner to deal with workplace issues and collectively bargain on pay,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019d urge all UK-based Ryanair cabin crew to join Unite and be part of one the biggest trade unions in the world representing airline workers.\u201d McCluskey said the union would be pursuing similar agreements with the agencies that indirectly employ the rest of Ryanair\u2019s UK cabin crew. \u201cUnite looks forward to building a positive relationship with Ryanair that benefits passengers and workers alike,\u201d he said. The International Transport Workers\u2019 Federation welcomed the union recognition, but said it did not yet mean Ryanair\u2019s working practices had been reformed. \u201cWe welcome this historic first step from Ryanair to talk to Unite the union on behalf of all UK workers. However, there is a still long way to go to resolve all the issues that their workforce have raised with our affiliates across the Ryanair network,\u201d said the ITF general secretary, Stephen Cotton. Ryanair\u2019s chief people officer, Eddie Wilson, said the Unite agreement was a further sign of the progress the airline was making with trade unions since its decision to recognise them. \u201cWe are confounding those sceptics who claimed that our decision was not real or genuine,\u201d he said.",

    "webTitle": "UK manufacturing output shrinks; Markets shrug off G7 debacle - as it happened", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Time for a recap. Britain has been hit by a flurry of weak economic data, that undermines confidence that its economy is recovering from its winter slowdown. New figures show that: UK manufacturing output fell by 1.4% in March, the worst performance since 2012 The trade gap widened to a 19-month high, at \u00a35.3bn Construction output posted another quarter-on-quarter decline. Economists warned that Brexit uncertainty may now be biting, making it harder for UK firms to win new business abroad. The drop in manufacturing output was driven by weaker demand for steel and electrical machinery. My colleague Larry Elliott says the figures are troubling: The manufacturing figures from the Office for National Statistics are troubling for three reasons. First, surveys had suggested a much better performance. Second, the 0.5% drop in production in the three months ending in April makes forecasts of a strong bounce-back from tepid growth in early 2018 look premature. Third, even if signs are correct that consumer spending is picking up because of falling inflation, the UK will have reverted to its old pattern of growth after a short interlude in which activity was better balanced. The markets have shrugged off last weekend\u2019s fractious and unconstructive G7 meeting, which saw Donald Trump fall out spectacularly with Canada\u2019s Justin Trudeau in a post-meeting tweet storm. Trump has now declared that trade should be truly reciprocal, as he continues to criticise other nations for their tariffs even as he threatens more of his own. European stock markets are all up in late trading, led by Italian optimism that its new government will not consider leaving the eurozone. FTSE 100: Up 50 points or 0.66% at 7731 points German DAX: Up 53 points or 0.4% at 12,819 points French CAC: Up 23 points or 0.4% at 5,473 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB: Up 738 points or 3.4% at 22,094 European car companies have taken a hit, though, due to fears they could be hit by new US tariffs. And it\u2019s been another rough day for the UK retail sector, with discount chain Poundworld falling into administration. More than 5,000 jobs are on the line. That\u2019s probably all for today, thanks for reading and commenting. GW Shares in European carmakers have fallen today, amid concerns that they could be dragged into a trade war between the US and Europe. Over the weekend, Donald Trump suggested he could impose tariffs on auto imports, using the same \u2018national security\u2019 argument he\u2019s already used for steel. Trump told reporters that there\u2019s an economic justification for tariffs: \u201cIt\u2019s economic. It\u2019s the balance sheet. To have a great military, you need a great balance sheet.\u201d Any new tariffs could make it uncompetitive for European carmakers to sell cars in the US, which explains why shares are under pressure today: However, several European carmakers including Fiat Chrysler and BMW actually have factories in America, building cars for export. New tariffs could encourage manufacturers to make more cars in the US, or it could force them to move production to cheaper sites. Greece has won more plaudits today as Athens\u2019 leftist-led government unveiled a multi-bill of \u201curgent\u201d reforms before the Greek parliament. The move officially launches the countdown to bailout exit in August, Helena Smith reports from Athens. As Greece\u2019s deputy finance minister Giorgos Chouliarakis formally presented the reforms before MPs - saying their passage would finally permit the country to exit international bailout oversight and successfully complete talks on the key issue of debt relief \u2013 Athens received what amounted to some of the highest praise, yet, from the euro group chairman himself. After almost a decade of being dependent on international bailout funds, Greece was ready to stand on its feet again, said Mario Centeno, president of the group of euro area finance ministers. \u201cGreece is a different country today,\u201d the Portuguese finance minister told a conference in Lisbon. \u201cGreece has the conditions to take on its own hands the process of its economic and social development, within the euro framework, and can always count on European solidarity if it sticks to the path of internal responsibility.\u201d The high praise came as Chouliarakis said it was vital the draft bill outlining further pension cuts, labour market reforms and privatisations in the energy domain, was voted on this week so that Greece could complete its final review by creditors in time for the next euro group meeting on June 21. That is when Athens not only hopes to take stock of a new \u20ac12b aid disbursement \u2013 it\u2019s last as a bailout programme recipient \u2013 but could finally embark on meaningful debt relief talks, he said. Greece\u2019s \u20ac320bn debt mountain is by far the biggest in Europe making economic recovery impossible if it is not reduced. Chouliarakis told MPs: \u201cCompletion of the fourth and last review of the economic adjustment programme will permit the Euro group on the 21 June to discuss, conclude and decide on a packet of measures for the reduction of Greek debt. Consequently it should be obvious to all why the legislation is of urgent character.\u201d Greece\u2019s staggering debt pile will also be the focus of talks today between German chancellor Angela Merkel and International Monetary Fund chief Christine Lagarde today. Ding ding! Wall Street has opened calmly, as US traders take the G7 meeting in their stride. The Dow Jones industrial average is 22 points higher, or 0.1%, with the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq also in the green (just). Craig Erlam of trading firm OANDA says investors aren\u2019t surprised that Donald Trump fell out (badly) with other world leaders in Quebec. The mood in financial markets is relatively upbeat at the start of a very busy week, as investors shrug off the G7 meeting which didn\u2019t exactly go to plan as Donald Trump rejected the prepared communique and left early. While everyone will have hoped for a better outcome from the meeting, I don\u2019t think anyone is surprised given Trump\u2019s views on trade and his combative approach to the country\u2019s allies on the issue. Perhaps it was the expectation that this was a likely outcome that has led to investors shrugging it off and turning their attention to something more interesting, and there\u2019s certainly plenty for them to focus on in the coming days. Newsflash: Jaguar Land Rover is moving the production of its Land Rover Discovery SUV vehicle to Slovakia, from Solihull in the UK. JLR says it will retool its Solihull plant to handle a new generation of electric, petrol and diesel models. But there could still be job cuts at the plant, close to Birmingham in the Midlands, as the changes are made. Kaye Wiggins of Bloomberg has more details: Discovery production will be moved from the beginning of 2019, meaning job cuts at the Solihull plant are possible before it ramps up staffing again, the people said. The investment, totaling hundreds of millions of pounds, according to the people, could cut both ways. While some agency-employed plant workers may lose their jobs, the decision to build electric cars at Solihull marks a major commitment to U.K. manufacturing amid uncertainty over Brexit. European stock markets are holding onto this morning\u2019s gains, as traders scamper from their desks for a quick lunchbreak (or spill sandwich crumbs on their keyboards). The European-wide Stoxx 600 is up 0.4%, thanks to rallies in London and in Italy. Italian stocks are buoyant after finance minister Giovanni Tria has insisted that Italy remained committed to the euro. Investors are putting the G7 meeting behind them, and concentrating on the imminent Trump-Kim summit in Singapore. Artjom Hatsaturjants, research analyst at Accendo Markets, says. \u201cThe FTSE has made a strong start for the week, with bullishness back in vogue in spite of a geopolitical dust-up at the weekend\u2019s G7 Summit in Canada. Investors appear to be writing off President Trump\u2019s bickering with his colleagues as same old, same old (start in attack dog mode, dial back rhetoric later), perhaps more interested in the Singapore summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. UK building firms are suffering from Brexit uncertainty and the weakness of the UK pound, says Michael Thirkettle, chief executive of construction consulting and design agency McBains. As mentioned earlier, construction output shrank by 3,4% in the three months to April. Almost every part of the sector suffered: Today\u2019s figures also show that total construction new orders fell by 4.6% in the first three months of this year, which will drag on output in the coming months. Thirkettle says: \u201cToday\u2019s statistics prove the construction sector is still in troubled waters with continuing uncertainties, borne from Brexit, and the poor value of sterling impacting on the cost of imported materials, meaning many UK companies are delaying investment decisions. \u201cThe real test, however, will be in the months to come, given the uncertainty over issues like Brexit that have impacted on UK companies\u2019 commitment to new projects over the last two years.\u201d Yet more disappointing news: the UK economy only grew by 0.2% in the last three months, from March to May. That\u2019s according to the latest estimate from the National Institute of Economic and Social Research (NIESR). It\u2019s better than the 0.1% recorded in the first three months, but it dashes hopes of a healthy rebound from the winter slowdown. Economists had pencilled in growth of 0.3%. Amit Kara, NIESR\u2019s head of UK macroeconomic forecasting, says the UK is only growing half as fast as its potential growth rate, partly due to the snow in March. Economic growth has slowed materially since the start of this year and it continues to remain weak. One reason for sluggish growth is the disruption caused by severe weather in March, particularly to the construction sector. The latest data also shows a notable slowdown in manufacturing sector output that appears to be driven by both domestic and external conditions. By contrast, the retail sector and the dominant services sector may be recovering. At Poundworld in Hyde in Tameside, Greater Manchester, shoppers were dismayed to hear of the chain\u2019s demise, reports my colleague Helen Pidd. \u201cOh what a shame,\u201d said Sylvia Andrew, 61, who had just paid a pound for a dummy security camera to protect her hen house. \u201cIf someone comes to nick my chickens they\u2019re not to know it\u2019s not real. If you put two AA batteries in a light flashes.\u201d. Currently signed off sick, she counts every penny, explaining: \u201cAt Poundworld you get two Pears soaps for \u00a31. It\u2019s \u00a31.50 at the supermarket.\u201d Joanne Betts, 48, a carer, had just bought four packets of Glow sticks for \u00a31 each and some bin bags. She told us: \u201cI didn\u2019t think a place like this would close. I\u2019 m in every week buying things I don\u2019t need.\u201d Inside, shoppers could spend a pound on anything from flip-flops to rat poison or packets of Aunt Bessie\u2019s yorkshire pudding mix. One of Poundworld\u2019s problems may have been its competitors. Next door to its Hyde store is Bodyworks, a discount cosmetic outlet. Next to that is B&amp;M Bargains, a northern chain which recently announced plans to open 45 stores down south. Add to that the Quality Save in the precinct, the Iceland in the shopping centre carpark and a branch of Yorkshire frozen food retailer Jack Fulton and it\u2019s clear bargain hunters are spoiled for choice. The slide in the pound today is pushing shares higher in London (as a weaker currency is good for exporters). The FTSE 100 is now up 70 points today at 7750, as City traders continue to shrug off the G7 mess. Newsflash: UK discount chain Poundworld has gone into administration, putting 5,100 jobs at risk. This is the latest in a string of retail failures this year, following the collapse of Toys R Us and Maplin. My colleague Rob Davies explains how last-ditch rescue talks to save the firm failed: Poundworld, which has a chain of 335 shops, filed a notice of intention to appoint an administrator last Thursday, giving it temporary protection from its creditors. But plans to find a buyer for the business have now been abandoned, although the administrators are likely to seek buyers for parcels of stores. But two potential rescue buyouts have fallen through, with private equity firms Rcapital and Alteri Partners both walking away after talks with current owners TPG Capital. All this weak economic data is bad for the pound. Sterling has shed half a cent against the US dollar to $1.335. It\u2019s down a similar amount against the euro, to \u20ac1.134. The 1.4% tumble in UK manufacturing output in April has come as a nasty shock to economists, who had expected a small rise. It undermines hopes that the UK economy was bouncing back from its slowdown last winter. Brexit could be partly responsible for the drop in UK manufacturing output last month. Economics journalist Dharshini Davis suspects that firms may find it harder to win business, because of the uncertainty over trading relations after March 2019. Suren Thiru, head of economics at the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC), fears that trade war fears are already hurting UK exporters. Here\u2019s his take on Britain\u2019s widening trade gap: \u201cThe deterioration in the UK\u2019s trade position in April is a concern and means that the UK\u2019s trade deficit remains significantly higher than the historical average. This deterioration largely reflects a marked decline in exports in the month. It is possible that the UK is now moving past the recent sweet spot for exporters, with growth in key markets moderating and the impact of the post-EU referendum slump in sterling, which has helped some exporters, subsiding. The possibility of an escalating trade war has added to the downside risks for exporters. \u201cMore must be done to support UK exporters by addressing longstanding issues, from the lack of practical support for exporters to chronic skills shortages.\u201d And Donald Trump thinks he\u2019s got trade problems.... This morning\u2019s economic data paints a rather grim picture of the UK economy. Here\u2019s the ONS\u2019s head of national accounts, Rob Kent-Smith: \u201cManufacturing fell in the three months to April with electrical machinery and steel for infrastructure projects seeing reduced production. International demand continued to slow and the domestic market remained subdued. However, oil and gas production grew strongly in the aftermath of the Forties pipeline closure at the end of last year. \u201cWhile construction output saw a small bounceback in April after a poor start to the year, over the longer-term this sector continues to contract with significant falls across most types of work. \u201cConstruction orders fell for a second successive quarter after recent boosts from large rail projects. However, new housing orders reached their highest level since before the economic downturn. \u201cThe trade deficit widened as exports fell by more than imports, with exports of goods and services both declining. Exports of machinery, aircraft and pharmaceuticals all saw notable falls.\u201d Make that a triple-dose of bad news! UK construction output fell by 3.3% year-on-year in April. That\u2019s the fourth drop in a row, and the longest negative run since May 2013. In a double-dose of bad news, Britain\u2019s trade gap with the rest of the world has worsened. The total UK trade deficit widened by \u00a31.9bn to \u00a39.7bn in the three months to April 2018, due mainly to falling exports of both goods and services. Here\u2019s the details: Goods exports fell \u00a33.1 billion, due mainly to falls in exports of machinery, pharmaceuticals and aircraft, while services exports also fell \u00a32.5 billion in the three months to April 2018. Falling volumes was the main reason for the declines in exports of machinery, pharmaceuticals and aircraft in the three months to April 2018 as price movements were relatively small. The UK\u2019s trade in goods deficit improved \u00a30.6 billion with countries outside of the EU and worsened \u00a31.2 billion with countries inside the EU in the three months to April 2018. In April alone, the trade gap widened to nearly \u00a35.3bn. Britain ran a surplus of \u00a38.7bn on services, but that was more than wiped out by a \u00a314bn deficit in goods. Total industrial production in the UK fell by 0.8% last month, dragged down by that worrying 1.4% slide in manufacturing. Energy production fell by 2%, thanks to the warmer weather. NEWSFLASH: Britain\u2019s manufacturers have suffered their biggest monthly fall in over five years -- raising new worries about the strength of the economy. UK manufacturing output fell by 1.4% in April 2018, new figures from the Office for National Statistics show. That\u2019s the biggest monthly fall since October 2012, when it shrank by 1.8%. The ONE warns: There is widespread weakness with 9 of the 13 sub-sectors decreasing and this is a continuation of the recent slowdown in this sector. Over the last three months, manufacturing output has now fallen by 0.5% - the worst performance since May 2017. The ONS blames \u201cdecreases in electrical equipment (9.4%), and basic metals and metal products (1.8%).\u201d More to follow.... Donald Trump told fellow G7 members that America was tired of other countries imposing unfair tariffs. The data, though, don\u2019t back this up. According to the World Bank, the average tariff on goods traded between countries has now fallen to 2.9%, thanks to various trade deals. G7 countries actually have lower tariffs -- at just 1.6% for goods coming into the UK, France, Germany or the US. Of course, there are still significant tariffs on some goods - such as milk imports into China, or tobacco imports into the US. But by unilaterally slapping tariffs on steel imports, Trump risks driving up the global tariff burden. Germany\u2019s economy minister has said the G7 meeting has bolstered unity among European Union members. Peter Altmaier told reports in Brussels that: \u201cThe commotion at the G7 summit in Canada has brought the European Union closer together. It is important we show unity at all levels.\u201d Four EU members took part in the G7 meeting - Germany, France, Italy and the UK. Like Canada, the EU is expected to hit back at America with a range of retaliatory tariffs on July 1st, in response to the US tariffs on steel and aluminium imports. Chancellor Angela Merkel took an unusually blunt line, saying that Trump\u2019s decision to withdraw from the G7 communique by tweet was sobering and depressing. She told the ARD broadcaster that: \u201cWe won\u2019t allow ourselves be ripped off again and again. We will act too. The Canadian dollar is dropping this morning, in the face of deteriorating relations between Washington and Ottawa. The loonie (as it\u2019s known in financial circles) has shed 0.3% against the greenback to C$1.296. That\u2019s a modest fall, following Trump\u2019s claim that Canadian PM Trudeau was \u201cvery dishonest and weak.\u201d Trump is particularly angry about Canadian milk, where domestic subsidies and high tariffs protect Canada\u2019s farmers from the vicissitudes of the dairy market. But that centralised \u2018supply management\u2019 system does seem to work; it avoids both bankruptcies and gluts by guaranteeing farmers a decent price. Trudeau is determined to support it. Ding! European stock markets are open, and rallying despite the lack of progress at the G7 meeting. In London the FTSE 100 has gained 35 points, or almost 0.5%, with similar gains in Frankfurt and Paris. Spain\u2019s IBEX has jumped by over 1%. Traders are jittery about the acrimony seen in Canada last weekend, says Mike van Dulken of Accendo Markets, but also hopeful of progress in Singapore. Van Dulken explains: Thankfully, there is more optimism about the US President\u2019s meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in Singapore. Potential for a meaningful discussions about de-nuclearisation on the Korean peninsula could diffuse some of the tensions between US and North Korea, improve the global mood and gain Trump some brownie points after this weekend\u2019s events at the G7. South Korea\u2019s stock market has led the rally in Asia today, on hopes that Donald Trump\u2019s next summit will be more productive than his last one. The Kospi index has gained 0.75% as traders prepared for the historic Trump-Kim meeting tomorrow. There are also gains in Japan and India, although China\u2019s benchmark index has dropped into the red. David Madden of CMC Markets says investors are hoping for a breakthrough: The US President left the G7 summit early in order to prepare for his meeting with Kim Jong Un, the North Korean leader. The meeting will take place today in Singapore. There has been a bit of toing and froing about the meeting, but now it seems as if it is finally going ahead. Last summer there were some volatile sessions on global stock markets on account of the heightened tensions between the US and North Korea because of the regime\u2019s nuclear weapons programme. The meeting between the two leaders could greatly improve political relations around the world. President Trump has launched another tirade at the rest of the G7, as he prepared for his summit with North Korea\u2019s Kim Jong-un in Singapore on Tuesday: Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. It was a bad weekend for fans of the rules-based international order, as the meeting of top world leaders struggled to meet even the lowest expectations. Relations between America and the rest of the G7 look worse than ever, after Donald Trump left the meeting early, refused to sign the official communique, and accused his host Justin Trudeau of making \u2018false statements\u2019. Getting all the adults in one room is meant to deliver progress and resolve differences, but not this time. Instead, the G7 has taken another step backwards, with Trump accusing the rest of the world of treating America like a \u2018Piggy Bank\u2019. So, the US is sticking to its new tariffs on steel and aluminium, and Canada is vowing to hit back with its retaliatory tariffs on US goods from July 1 \u2013 despite being accused of treachery by Trump\u2019s economic advisor. The scale of the debacle suggests that the alliances and structures build up over the last 70 years are now creaking alarmingly, raising the dangers of a full-blown trade war. The financial markets, though, are remarkably unconcerned by events in Quebec. Asian stocks have risen overnight, with Japan\u2019s Nikkei gaining 0.5%. European markets are expected to rally too; Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 is expected to creep higher today too. Neil Wilson of Markets.com says investors are shrugging off the G7 \u201cMarkets appear able to shake off geopolitical risks with stocks showing firmness in the face of a pretty torrid weekend for free trade. Asian shares have risen and futures point to the FTSE opening up around 0.2%, with smaller rises for the DAX and CAC. After a stormy G7 meeting, the US seems to have turned its back on its allies and is prepared to ratchet up the pressure on trade. Ostensibly this should not be good for risk, though markets appear deaf at present to such rumbings. This is brinkmanship that may ultimately end up working to the advantage of the US; but it is also likely to depress investor sentiment, and therefore growth through the second part of 2018.

      "bodyText": "Britain\u2019s biggest car manufacturer, Jaguar Land Rover, is to transfer all production of its Land Rover Discovery model from the West Midlands to a plant in Slovakia, potentially putting hundreds of jobs at risk. A spokesman for JLR said the Slovakian plant had been developed over several years and the latest move was unconnected to the Brexit headwinds that led to it announcing 1,000 UK jobs would go in April. Its profits have also been dented by the decline in diesel sales, slumping to \u00a3364m pre-tax in the three months to the end of March, compared to \u00a3676m in the same period last year. The Labour MP Madeleine Moon, who is a member of the pro-remain campaign group Best for Britain, said: \u201cThis is truly shocking news. The automotive industry has been warning of the dangers facing their sector and now it appears the reality of Brexit is setting in. \u201cJobs have already gone in a number of car factories. When will this government finally admit to the damage they\u2019re causing and start to listen to groups like the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders who don\u2019t want British cars stagnating in the slow lane?\u201d JLR said there would be a \u201csignificant investment and technology upgrade\u201d in its Solihull factory, with the carmaker believed to be spending hundreds of millions of pounds to meet its low-carbon commitments. The manufacturer said it would also be investing in its plant at Halewood, Merseyside, to build the next generation Range Rover Evoque. The move has also been welcomed locally in the Midlands as a step for the manufacturer to upgrade the Solihull plant to build new, electric models. In the short-term, more work than anticipated will move to JLR\u2019s new \u00a31bn facility in Nitra, Slovakia, which is due to open at the end of the year and is expected to build the revamped Land Rover Defender. JLR, owned by the Indian company Tata, had already signalled it would move a large amount of the production on the Discovery, which sold about 45,000 units last year, the lowest volume of the five models built in Solihull. In a statement, JLR said: \u201cThis significant investment and technology upgrade in Solihull in order to accommodate our next generation of flagship Land Rover models, and the refit of our Halewood plant for the next Evoque, is proof that we remain committed both to the UK and to transformation and growth.\u201d Adding that job losses would come from agency staff employed at Solihull, the company said: \u201cThe decision to move the Land Rover Discovery to Slovakia and the potential losses of some agency employed staff in the UK is a tough one but forms part of our long-term manufacturing strategy as we transform our business globally.\u201d The news fuelled more concern that jobs in car manufacturing could be at risk after Brexit. The motor industry has repeatedly warned that any possible border delays for parts would impose fresh burdens and deter manufacturers from continuing production in Britain. The company has said it would make an electric option for each of its new models after 2020. David Bailey, the professor of industrial strategy at the University of Aston, said: \u201cThere has been speculation locally that they needed to free up space to make electric vehicles. There was concern that their first electric car, the I-Pace, was being made in Austria \u2013 people wanted that built here. \u201cIf this move on the Discovery means producing electric cars here, overall that is a good thing. We want to see that transition to a low-carbon economy in the Midlands and we want to see the jobs here. \u201cJLR have been too slow in getting into hybrids and they have to speed up in getting fully into electric vehicles.\u201d",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "There was a ready-made explanation when the March manufacturing figures were bad. Falling factory output was all down to the weather \u2013 the blizzards brought in by the \u201cbeast from the east\u201d. No such excuse is available this time. Manufacturing posted its biggest fall in production in more than five years. It was the third monthly decline running and nine of 13 industrial subsectors said they had cut output. The expected bounce-back in the construction sector was also a lot less vigorous than predicted, while order books for building firms look weak. The manufacturing figures from the Office for National Statistics are troubling for three reasons. First, surveys had suggested a much better performance. Second, the 0.5% drop in production in the three months ending in April makes forecasts of a strong bounce-back from tepid growth in early 2018 look premature. Third, even if signs are correct that consumer spending is picking up because of falling inflation, the UK will have reverted to its old pattern of growth after a short interlude in which activity was better balanced. The travails of Britain\u2019s manufacturing sector are part of a broader slowdown in industrial production since the end of 2017. Softer demand from other European countries and a stronger pound have been factors but UK firms have not exactly helped themselves by squandering the opportunity provided by the exchange rate depreciation that followed the EU referendum two years ago. Given the choice between using a more competitive pound to sell more abroad or to boost their profit margins, companies chose the latter course. That helps explain why the improvement in Britain\u2019s trade figures is a lot less impressive than it might have been and why productivity growth \u2013 which is easier to generate in manufacturing than in the services sector \u2013 has been so poor. Manufacturing makes up 10% of the economy\u2019s output and construction a further 6%, so it is a bit too early to rule out an increase in interest rates from the Bank of England at its August meeting. A lot will depend on news from services, which account for 80% of gross domestic product. Even so, the dismal news from manufacturing and construction matters. The Bank\u2019s optimism that a pick-up in growth in the second quarter will justify higher borrowing costs is based so far purely on survey evidence. This is the first hard data for the second quarter \u2013 and it is not good. Why Draghi and ECB may be slow to let go of QE It took the European Central Bank a long time to find the quantitative easing habit. While the US Federal Reserve and the Bank of England were printing electronic money like there was no tomorrow, the new form stimulus was all a bit too radical for the monetary conservatives at the ECB. That, though, has all changed under the presidency of Mario Draghi, who finally overcame resistance to QE and announced a bond-buying programme in January 2015. Although the eurozone has subsequently perked up, there are still some policymakers, the Bundesbank\u2019s Jens Weidmann for one, who fear that too much QE will be inflationary. Weidmann is insisting that the ECB wind up its programme by the end of the year, and preliminary discussions will take place at the bank\u2019s meeting in Latvia this Thursday. A report by Arend Kapteyn, the chief economist at the UBS investment bank, shows just how crucial QE has been to the eurozone. The ECB\u2019s headline deposit rate stands at -0.4% but once QE is taken into account the effective policy rate is -5%. Eurozone growth since 2015 has average 2.2% but of that 0.75 points are the result of the ECB\u2019s stimulus. Kapteyn estimates that the eurozone\u2019s trend rate of growth \u2013 the non-inflationary pace at which it can expand once unused capacity is used up \u2013 is around 1% and not the 1.5% the ECB and the International Monetary Fund are forecasting. That means the eurozone looks extremely vulnerable to the next global slowdown, whenever that occurs. It also suggests the ECB may be as slow to dispense with QE as it was to embrace it. Markets\u2019 reaction to testy G7 summit has history on its side Financial markets couldn\u2019t care less that the G7 in Canada ended in failure and history suggests investors are right to dismiss the photo ops as empty pageantry. It is almost 500 years since what is regarded as the first international summit resulted in Henry VIII and Francis I of France seeking to outshine each other at the Field of the Cloth of Gold. Nothing earth-shattering happened there, either.",

The Financial Reporting Council reprimanded KPMG but said the fine was reduced from \u00a34.5m as part of a settlement agreement. The settlement over Quindell comes with the audit profession \u2013 and KPMG in particular \u2013 under intense scrutiny in the light of the collapse of the government contractor Carillion, with two select committees calling for a break-up of the \u201cbig four\u201d accountants. In a statement regarding KPMG\u2019s work for Quindell, the FRC said the accountancy company had \u201cadmitted that their conduct fell significantly short of the standards reasonably to be expected\u201d of a member of the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales (ICAEW). The accounting watchdog launched an investigation into KPMG in 2015 after Quindell, which had been a darling of the junior Aim stock market, became the subject of multiple investigations into its financial statements. The group\u2019s value had soared to \u00a32.7bn, putting it on course to enter the FTSE 250, until doubts emerged about the validity of its reported profits. It eventually restated its 2014 profits, turning an \u00a383m profit into a \u00a368m loss. It is still under investigation by the Serious Fraud Office. The FRC said KPMG\u2019s fine was related to its \u201cfailure to obtain reasonable assurance that the financial statements as a whole were free from material misstatement\u201d. It also cited \u201cfailure to obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence and failure to exercise sufficient professional scepticism\u201d. A spokesperson for KPMG said: \u201cAudit quality, and professional scepticism in particular, is of paramount importance to our firm. We have cooperated fully throughout the FRC\u2019s investigation and have already updated our audit processes and procedures to address the areas of concern. \u201cWe regret that some aspects of our audit for the year ended 31 December 2013 did not meet the required standards. As we stated in our audit opinion for the following year, certain information given to KPMG contradicted representations previously made by former members of management. \u201cNonetheless, we accept the FRC\u2019s findings that in two specific areas of the audit, our challenge for the year ended 31 December 2013 should have gone further. \u201cDue to ongoing investigations by the FRC and SFO we are unable to comment further.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Britain\u2019s factories unexpectedly recorded the sharpest fall in output for more than five years in April amid falling demand for steel and electrical machinery, raising fresh concern over the strength of the economy. Pointing to fewer orders for steel used in infrastructure projects and a wider slowdown in demand for British goods at home and abroad, the Office for National Statistics said manufacturing output fell by 1.4% in April from the previous month. Economists had forecast modest growth of 0.3%. The figures will trouble ministers at a time of growing concerns for the UK steel industry, which faces pressure from US import tariffs that could rekindle the crisis of two years ago, when a glut of Chinese imports threatened to bankrupt British producers. Overall industrial output \u2013 which includes manufacturing, utilities and mining \u2013 dropped in April by 0.8% compared with the previous month, led by the fall in factory production and similar declines for energy supply and water usage. The figures were released as the National Institute of Economic and Social Research forecast only a modest rebound for growth in the three months to the end of May, predicting a rise in GDP of 0.2% during the period, up from a rate of 0.1% in the three months to the end of April. Amit Kara, Niesr\u2019s head of UK macroeconomic forecasting, spoke of risks to the economy from Brexit and escalating trade tensions, saying: \u201cEconomic growth has slowed materially since the start of this year and it continues to remain weak.\u201d Union leaders seized on the manufacturing figures to criticise the government for its stance on Brexit and not doing enough to support businesses amid the mounting trade tensions with the US. Labour and business groups have attacked ministers for mishandling the industrial strategy, pointing to a lack of progress made since it was launched in the autumn. Jude Brimble, the national secretary of the GMB union, said: \u201cBetween Trump wanting to slap tariffs on our steel and the UK government refusing to be in a European customs union, UK manufacturing risks being stranded.\u201d There was a slight monthly pick-up for construction industry output in April as builders staged a recovery from the heavy snowfall in March. Yet the ONS said the three months to April remained the worst period for the trade since August 2012. The figures will renew fears the slowdown for the British economy in the first three months of the year was not just a one-off, adding to problems that could deter the Bank of England from raising interest rates in August. \u201cGiven how sharp the fall was, it\u2019s easy to try to pin it down to some kind of temporary aberration. But that doesn\u2019t appear to be the case,\u201d James Smith, an economist at ING Bank, said. \u201cRemember, too, that April was supposed to be the month where production rebounded following the snow-related disruptions seen in March.\u201d The latest figures also showed the UK\u2019s trade position with the rest of the world deteriorated further in April. Britain\u2019s trade in goods deficit, which is the difference between products sold abroad and imported to the UK, unexpectedly widened by about \u00a32bn to reach \u00a314bn \u2013 the biggest monthly gap since September 2016. Suren Thiru, the head of economics at the British Chambers of Commerce, said a sweet spot for exporters could be reaching an end. \u201cThe possibility of an escalating trade war has added to the downside risks for exporters,\u201d he said.",

    "webTitle": "Poundworld falls into administration, putting 5,000 jobs at risk", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Poundworld has collapsed into administration, putting more than 5,000 jobs at risk, after rescue talks failed over the weekend. It is the latest blow for Britain\u2019s struggling high streets, where a string of retailers and restaurants have shrunk or collapsed due to rising costs and a consumer spending squeeze. Poundworld, which has 335 shops, filed a notice of intention to appoint an administrator last Thursday, giving it temporary protection from its creditors. Deloitte, which was appointed as administrator on Friday, said Poundworld would trade as usual while it sought a buyer for all or part of the business, adding that no redundancies or store closures were planned. At Poundworld in Hyde, in Tameside, Greater Manchester, shoppers were dismayed to hear of the chain\u2019s demise. \u201cWhat a shame,\u201d said Sylvia Andrew, 61, who had just paid a pound for a dummy security camera to protect her hen house. \u201cIf someone comes to nick my chickens they\u2019re not to know it\u2019s not real. If you put two AA batteries in a light flashes,\u201d she said. Currently signed off sick, she counts every penny: \u201cAt Poundworld you get two Pears soaps for \u00a31. It\u2019s \u00a31.50 at the supermarket,\u201d she said. Joanne Betts, 48, a carer, had just bought four packets of glow sticks for \u00a31 each and some bin bags. She said: \u201cI didn\u2019t think a place like this would close. I\u2019m in every week buying things I don\u2019t need.\u201d Inside, shoppers could spend a pound on anything from flip-flops to rat poison or packets of Aunt Bessie\u2019s Yorkshire pudding mix. One of Poundworld\u2019s problems may have been its competitors. Next door to its Hyde store is Bodyworks, a discount cosmetics outlet. Next to that is B&amp;M Bargains, a northern chain that recently announced plans to open 45 stores in southern England. Add to that the Quality Save in the precinct, the Iceland in the shopping centre carpark and a branch of Jack Fulton, the Yorkshire frozen food retaile , and it\u2019s clear bargain hunters are spoiled for choice. Deloitte said Poundworld had struggled in an increasingly competitive market for discount goods, but also blamed \u201chigh product-cost inflation, decreasing footfall [and] weaker consumer confidence\u201d. Two potential rescue buyouts have fallen through, with the private equity firms Rcapital and Alteri Partners both walking away after talks with Poundworld\u2019s owners, TPG Capital, a US private equity firm. Chris Edwards, who founded the business in Wakefield, Yorkshire, in 1974 before selling it to TPG for \u00a3150m, is also thought to have been interested in buying back the business. Deloitte\u2019s joint administrator, Clare Boardman, said: \u201cThe retail trading environment in the UK remains extremely challenging and Poundworld has been seeking to address this through a restructure of its business. \u201cUnfortunately, this has not been possible. We still believe a buyer can be found for the business, or at least part of it, and we are keeping staff appraised of developments as they happen. We thank all employees for their support at this difficult time. A TPG spokesperson said: \u201cThis was a difficult decision for every party involved. We invested in Poundworld because of our belief in how the company serves its customers and the strength of its employees. \u201cDespite investing resources to strengthen the business, the decline in UK retail and changing consumer behaviour affected Poundworld significantly.\u201d The retail analyst Nick Bubb said the relative health of Poundworld\u2019s rival Poundland, despite a crowded marketplace for discount retailers, indicated the business had been poorly managed. \u201cPoundland is doing OK, despite the general pressure on the high street pound chains from the growth of B&amp;M and Home Bargains in food and toiletries and the growth of Aldi and Lidl,\u201d he said. \u201cSo it must be down to management, and I suspect Poundworld lost a lot of momentum when the founder, Chris Edwards, stepped back from the business.\u201d The demise of Poundworld follows the collapse into administration this year of the electronics firm Maplin and Toys R Us. The high street has also been rocked by a succession of retailers and restaurant chains announcing plans to shut stores amid tougher trading conditions. House of Fraser announced plans last week to close 31 stores, putting a further 6,000 jobs at risk. Mothercare, New Look and Carpetright are closing dozens of outlets after creditors approved company voluntary arrangements (CVAs), insolvency procedures that enable them to reduce rents and shut shops. Restaurants including Prezzo, the burger chain Byron and Jamie\u2019s Italian have also closed outlets using the process. Poundworld\u2019s problems surfaced in April when its owner was said to be considering launching a CVA, affecting about 100 stores.",

      "bodyText": "Rolls-Royce has discovered new problems with its troubled Trent 1000 engines, which power Boeing\u2019s 787 Dreamliner aircraft, triggering fresh safety fears and potential disruption for airlines including British Airways and Norwegian. The aircraft engine maker said a problem affecting compressor durability had been found in another type of Trent 1000 engines and would require inspections of its 166 \u201cpackage B\u201d engines, some of which have been in service since 2012. The problem means parts wear out faster than expected. Rolls-Royce has been trying to fix durability faults with \u201cpackage C\u201d versions of the engine. Some aircraft powered by Trent 1000 engines have been grounded, leading to flight cancellations and forcing airlines such as Virgin Atlantic to lease other aircraft. The company warned that fixing the latest problem will result in additional costs, although it is still expecting to generate about \u00a3450m in cash this year. It is cutting jobs and reducing non-essential spending on travel and IT upgrades to offset the impact of the engine faults. The Rolls-Royce chief executive. Warren East. is expected to announce a shake-up of the business, including more than 4,000 job losses, on Friday, when the company holds an investor day in London. The firm has indicated that it is cutting middle-management posts rather than frontline engineering jobs, without putting a number on the planned redundancies. Some analysts have pencilled in a reduction of up to 10% of Rolls-Royce\u2019s 50,000 workforce. Rolls-Royce had initially put the cost of fixing the \u201cpackage C\u201d engines at \u00a3370m but indicated in April that figure would rise with the cost of replacing more parts and paying airlines compensation. Analysts have put the bill at up to \u00a31bn. Chris Cholerton, the Rolls-Royce president of civil aerospace, said: \u201cWe are working closely with our customers to minimise any operational impact of these inspections and we deeply appreciate their continued co-operation.

    "webTitle": "Germany and France close gap on UK for foreign investment", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The UK remains Europe\u2019s top destination for inward investment, but its star is waning as Brexit uncertainty allows Germany and France to close the gap. Last year the UK attracted 6% more foreign direct investment (FDI) projects that the previous year, according to figures compiled by EY in a survey of 450 global investors, but fell behind France, which grew by 31%, and the European average growth rate of 10%. EY said the UK\u2019s market share fell for the second successive year in 2017 and was likely to suffer a further decline as investors said they favoured Germany for the future. France was in second place, supported by the \u201cMacron effect\u201d, and the UK came third. The UK attracted 1,205 FDI projects in 2017 compared with France\u2019s 1,019. Britain enjoyed a 22% boost in foreign investment into digital enterprises, but this compared with an average 33% rise across Europe. Investor concerns over Brexit were felt most in financial services, business services and a decline in the number of firms opening headquarters in the UK. EY said the figures contrasted with OECD and United Nations data for the UK that showed a collapse in FDI between 2016 and 2017 of more than 90%. However, the OECD and the 2018 UN Conference on Trade and Development (Unctad) report includes mergers and acquisitions, which soared ahead of the Brexit vote only to collapse in 2017. EY\u2019s chief economist, Mark Gregory, said his firm\u2019s report focused on projects rather than the purchase of shares in UK businesses. He said: \u201cOnce again we find evidence of an economy in transition with individual sectors behaving in different ways in response to changes in the business environment.\u201d Gregory said the services sector was the first to delay or switch investment plans while the manufacturing sector, which tends to operate over longer timescales, had proved slower to react to the referendum vote. \u201cIn part this reflects the fact that it is easier to delay or shift investments [in the services sector], compared to capital-intensive activity in manufacturing for example,\u201d he said. While foreign investors have become reluctant to invest as much as they did in Britain, 2017 was a record year for the outflow of funds following a 35% increase in UK businesses investing into Europe. EY said UK firms were starting to \u201cposition themselves for Brexit\u201d with financial services sector, business services and digital services firms leading the way. The EY UK chairman, Steve Varley, said: \u201cA swell of digital projects flowed into Europe changing the shape of FDI and bringing new dynamic businesses to the continent. Digital projects increased by 33% across Europe \u2013 three times the rate of overall market growth \u2013 and 34% in London, but only 22% across the UK as a whole. \u201cAt a time when investor sentiment towards the UK as an attractive destination is weakening, opportunity arises in the shape of digital. An urgent digital drive is needed with a renewed focus on digital skills, infrastructure, and investment in research and development will help to shape the UK as an attractive environment, to maintain its competitiveness in a post-Brexit world,\u201d he added.",
