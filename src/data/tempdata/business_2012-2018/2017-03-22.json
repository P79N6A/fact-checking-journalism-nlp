The Dow Jones Industrial Average, which passed the 20,000 mark only in January, was approaching 21,000 before Tuesday\u2019s decline that continued into Wednesday. The previous pace couldn\u2019t have been sustained for ever. Stock markets rarely run in straight lines, especially when the US Federal Reserve has raised rates twice in three months. It\u2019s a similar story in the UK. Just as the Dow remains above 20,000, so the FTSE 100 index closed on Wednesday 300 points above the 7,000 mark, which it last passed around Christmas time. The Trump bump to share prices has merely received a dent, which was to be expected. It would be also be fair to say the mood is nervous. If the president is running into political trouble in his attempt to repeal Obamacare, will there also be delays to his promised infrastructure splurge, the factor that has driven share prices higher? It\u2019s a fair question, and the answer will be critical for stock markets in the short-term. Yet the most interesting market movement is happening not in share prices but in oil. The price of a barrel of Brent dipped below $50 on Wednesday, down 11% since the start of the month. That wasn\u2019t part of the script when Opec and a few non-Opec countries, including Russia, agreed a deal to curb production at the end of last year. In the event, oil stocks remain high and US production is strong, presenting Opec with a serious headache. If it wants to force the oil price higher, its production cuts may have to be deeper for longer. It\u2019s not obvious that all its members \u2013 and especially the non-members \u2013 have the political will or financial flexibility. A lower oil price this year would be excellent news, not least for Downing Street and the Bank of England. It would dampen the currency-inspired inflation in other parts of the economy. If cheaper oil is accompanied by a minor stock market wobble, that\u2019s not so bad. Off the hook lightly for Thames Water Pumping huge quantities of untreated sewage into the River Thames is as bad as it gets if, like Thames Water, two of your aims are to \u201cprevent pollution\u201d and \u201cprotect and, where possible, improve wildlife and conserve our cultural heritage\u201d. Visible sewage was seen along nine miles of the river in 2012 and 2013, killing birds and fish. The sentencing remarks in a case brought by the Environment Agency (EA) were suitably damning. \u201cThis is a shocking and disgraceful state of affairs,\u201d said the judge, Francis Sheridan, at Aylesbury crown court. The EA said it was the biggest freshwater pollution case it had mounted and \u201ca pattern of unprecedented pollution incidents\u201d could have been avoided if Thames had been open and frank in its dealings with the agency. Hit the owners where it hurts, then? That was the judge\u2019s aim. \u201cOne has to get the message across to the shareholders that the environment is to be treasured and protected, and not poisoned,\u201d he said. But if he thinks a \u00a320.3m penalty will impress Thames shareholders \u2013 a crew of infrastructure and sovereign wealth funds who have done splendidly over their decade of ownership \u2013 he needs to raise his sights. Thames Water Utilities, the debt-laden operating company that sits under various holding companies, incurred net finance expenses of \u00a3257m in its last financial year, but still made a \u00a3511m profit before tax. Consider that a sum of \u00a320m equates to a single week\u2019s investment by Thames. Thames Water\u2019s chief executive, Steve Robertson ,cited the investment figure to show the company understands \u201cour huge responsibilities to the environment\u201d. It would be equally true to say that, in financial terms, a \u00a320m fine will be lost in the wash of raw sewage. Kingfisher\u2019s \u2018key learnings\u2019 \u201cLooking forward, the EU referendum has created uncertainty for the UK economic outlook and we remain cautious on the outlook for France,\u201d says V\u00e9ronique Laury, the chief executive of Kingfisher, which owns B&amp;Q and Screwfix.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The latest unemployment rate figures brought the bad news that the unemployment rate is again rising, but perhaps more concerning is that February saw a record level of underemployment. With weak full-time employment growth, underemployment is in many ways now a better indicator of the health of the economy than the unemployment rate. Before the 1990s recession, underemployment wasn\u2019t really a thing. During the 80s the underemployment rate was rarely above 4%; after it, and the destruction it wrought on full-time work, it was rarely below 6%: The global financial crisis also had a significant impact. Before the GFC, at the height of the mining boom, 5.9% of the labour force were underemployed; last month this figure hit 8.7% and hasn\u2019t been below 7% for more than five and a half years. The rise in underemployment has been a big factor in the dislocation of the unemployment rate from the real-world experience of the labour market. Traditionally, underemployment and unemployment are closely linked. When unemployment rises that is usually a sign that the economy is weakening and businesses cut the hours of workers, which increases underemployment. When things are going well, the opposite usually occurs \u2013 not only are businesses employing more people they also increase the hours worked by those already employed \u2013 ie, reducing underemployment. But in the middle of 2014, the relationship between the unemployment and underemployment broke down: The reason (as I have noted a few times) is the lack of full-time work compared with part-time. Since May 2014, 329,000 new part-time jobs have been created compared with just 152,000 full-time ones. That is a massive change given that two-thirds of all jobs are full time. And as I have also noted the hardest hit have been the youth, and not surprisingly they are the ones who have the highest level of underemployment. Nearly 20% of women in the labour force aged 15 to 24 are underemployed, and 16.2% of men that age \u2013 both records. Since May 2014, the rates of underemployment for both genders under 25 have risen by more than any other age group: And while it would be easy to think it is a just an issue of youth \u2013 and thus might be something that is quarantined from the broader economy \u2013 the reality is that underemployment is now affecting workers of all ages at record levels. A comparison of the unemployment and underemployment rates for workers aged 25 to 54 shows a similar disconnect occurring in 2014: The impact of weak full-time employment growth is evident when we compared the percentage of adults aged 25 to 64 who are employed and those employed full time. A decade ago 74.7% of 25- to 64-year-olds were employed; that has now risen to a near record 75.9%. By contrast the percentage of this prime-working aged group of adults who are employed full time has fallen from 56.7% to 55.7%: The last time so few prime-working aged adults were working full time was in 2005. The big reason is the absolute collapse of male full-time work since the GFC. Despite weak economic growth, women have continued to find more full-time work than in the past. Currently, 39.5% of women aged 25 to 64 work full time \u2013 just down on the record of 39.8% reached in the middle of last year. By contrast the proportion of prime-working aged men in full-time jobs has fallen in the past 10 years from 75% to a new record low in February of 72.4%: One difficulty in comparing underemployment with the past is that there are two reasons why people want more hours \u2013 one negative and one positive. Mostly with men the issue is a negative \u2013 men want more hours because they are seeking full-time work or more part-time hours. But for women the issue is not completely negative. There are more women underemployed now than ever before despite there also being more women working full time than ever before. Women not only are working full time more than ever before there are also more women than ever before desiring to work full time. That is not necessarily a bad thing but it does still indicate that there is a lot of spare capacity in the labour force. And that spare capacity is a big driver of the current record low wages growth. I noted last month that wages and unemployment normally are in sync \u2013 when one falls the other rises \u2013 but over the past two years the relationship has broken down. Wages growth has fallen even while the unemployment rate has fallen: But if instead of the unemployment rate we use the underemployment rate, we see the relationship remains in sync: While we still have wage growth slightly below what we would expect, it is not out as whack as it seems when comparing it with the unemployment rate. And the bad news is that given we have just hit a record high rate of underemployment, it suggests that for those hoping for an improvement in wages growth will probably have to wait a bit longer.",

Wages growth has fallen even while the unemployment rate has fallen:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Phillips Curve - wage growth v unemployment rate\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/TdidB/1/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p> But if instead of the unemployment rate we use the underemployment rate, we see the relationship remains in sync:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Wage growth v underemployment rate\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/ZbMES/1/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p> While we still have wage growth slightly below what we would expect, it is not out as whack as it seems when comparing it with the unemployment rate.</p> <p> And the bad news is that given we have just hit a record high rate of underemployment, it suggests that for those hoping for an improvement in wages growth will probably have to wait a bit longer.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Shares, oil and the US dollar were all under pressure as global financial markets took fright at the prospect that Donald Trump would fail to deliver on his growth-boosting promises. In the most nervous conditions since the immediate aftermath of the president\u2019s shock victory in last November\u2019s elections, stock markets in Asia and Europe fell in response to Tuesday\u2019s sharp decline on Wall Street. The biggest fall in US shares in five months prompted declines in Tokyo, Frankfurt, Paris and London, which in turn ensured another jittery opening in New York. In the City, the FTSE 100 closed 54 points lower at 7,324.72. Markets have become increasingly impatient with the new Trump administration for failing to follow through on pledges to use a package of tax cuts and infrastructure spending to raise the US growth rate. Share prices have risen steadily since Trump defeated Hillary Clinton in last November\u2019s race for the White House amid optimism that the US could be on the point of breaking out of the low-growth path evident since the world\u2019s biggest economy emerged from recession almost eight years ago. But sentiment has turned this week after it became clear that there is likely to be a protracted delay before the Trump administration can get tax cuts through Congress. Investors believe a failure to secure agreement on Capitol Hill to repeal Barack Obama\u2019s healthcare act \u2013 the new administration\u2019s first legislative test \u2013 will lead to a further sell-off on Wall Street. On the foreign exchanges, money flowed out of the dollar and into the safe haven of the Japanese yen. Sterling rose to stand at just under $1.25 against the US currency. News of an increase in US oil stocks led to a fresh drop in the cost of crude, already under downward pressure on concerns that an Opec deal to curb production has started to unravel. A barrel of Brent crude was changing hands at less than $50 a barrel and is down 11% since the start of March. Jasper Lawler, a senior market analyst at London Capital Group, said: \u201cIt\u2019s overly simplistic to lay the blame for the market decline at Donald Trump\u2019s door. The first US rate hike this year, a slump in oil prices, the future of quantitative easing under higher inflation and end of quarter portfolio manoeuvring have played a part in markets changing course. Still, the Trump presidency, which has played such a large role in the rise in markets since November, is not to be ignored as a factor.\u201d Lawler added that what had been seen as the two biggest contributors to the idea that the world was reflating \u2013 a Trump-led fiscal boost and rising oil prices \u2013 had come unstuck in the past fortnight. The \u201crepeal and replace\u201d of Obamacare was being seen as an acid test of whether Trump could deliver on his fiscal plans and the difficulties encountered were a \u201cbad omen\u201d for tax reform.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The chair of the company behind the first new car plant in Britain for more than a decade has urged the UK and European governments not let Brexit ruin the country\u2019s automotive industry. Carl-Peter Forster was speaking as the London Taxi Company (LTC), the maker of London\u2019s trademark black cabs, officially opened a factory in Coventry to build electric taxis. The plant will create more than 1,000 jobs and is funded with investment worth \u00a3325m from the Chinese car company Geely, which owns LTC. The Coventry plant is the first site in the UK dedicated to the production of electric cars. It covers the size of nearly 20 football pitches and has capacity to manufacture 20,000 vehicles a year. LTC and Geely will also make small electric vans at the factory, which the companies believe could be a new growth market. They are looking to export the electric taxi outside London, but will focus on the UK first. Greg Clark, the business secretary, said the new factory and Toyota\u2019s announcement last week that it will invest \u00a3240m into modernising its Derbyshire production line is \u201crecognition of our seriousness in the industrial strategy\u201d. He was very confident about the future of the car industry in Britain, he said. Forster, the former boss of General Motors Europe and Jaguar Land Rover, urged the UK and EU to reach a mutually beneficial deal for the automotive industry as part of Brexit. \u201cI think there is a mutual interest on both sides not to disrupt \u2026 and kill this very positive collaboration\u201d between the UK and European car industries,\u201d he said. \u201cWe bank on all governments to keep that in mind.\u201d Forster said sterling\u2019s depreciation since the referendum had already hurt LTC\u2019s profit margins, but added: \u201cWe will somehow live with it.\u201d On the potential terms of Brexit, he said: \u201cWe need a stable and level playing field in terms of trading, rules and regulations. We bank on the UK government to keep that in mind.\u201d Automotive industry bosses have consistently said that leaving the single market and the customs union could have a damaging impact on UK plants because of the number of cars exported and the high proportion of car parts imported. Around half the parts for the new electric taxi made at the Coventry factory will come from outside the UK. A report by PA Consulting said earlier this week that the cost of assembling a car in Britain could increase by \u00a32,370 in the event of a hard Brexit, forcing some manufacturers to look at moving production out of the country. The increase in costs \u2013 equivalent to more than 10% per vehicle \u2013 would hit if Britain falls back on World Trade Organisation rules after leaving the EU. Even if the UK agrees a tariff of 5% with the EU on importing and exporting cars and 2.5% on components, then \u00a31,202 will be added to the cost of production. The report said it would make economic sense for some manufacturers to abandon British factories if 10% WTO tariffs were introduced. The cost of exporting 200,000 cars a year from the UK would be \u00a3920m after two years, which PA Consulting said would easily cover the cost of building a new plant in the EU. The government has provided a \u00a316.1m grant through the regional growth fund for LTC\u2019s new factory. Clark said the facility, which will also house research and development, demonstrated that the UK was a \u201cworld leader in the development of new automotive technologies\u201d. He has pledged to put support for the development of electric vehicles at the heart of the government\u2019s industrial strategy. \u201cOur iconic black cabs are famous across the world. The London Taxi Company\u2019s impressive new factory and R&amp;D facility showcases the innovation that makes the UK a world leader in the development of new automotive technologies,\u201d he said. \u201cThrough our ambitious industrial strategy, we are committed to building on our strengths and taking advantage of the opportunities the new low-carbon economy provides.\u201d The Department for Transport aims to encourage taxi drivers to buy new electric vehicles with \u00a364m in incentives. The money will be used to offer taxi drivers a \u00a37,500 discount on the cost of an electric vehicle and pay for more charging points across the UK. John Hayes, the transport minister, said: \u201cThis government is committed to improving air quality and reducing pollution in towns and cities, which is essential for people\u2019s health and the environment.\u201d Unions welcomed the investment, particularly in light of LTC going into administration in 2013 before being bought by Geely. Unite\u2019s regional officer Peter Coulson said: \u201cThis a fantastic story of a company that was on its knees in 2013. Now thanks to the commitment of Geely\u2019s top management and accompanying large-scale investment the iconic London taxi is set for its continued renaissance. \u201cTribute should also be paid to the dedicated workforce who have worked hard and diligently to contribute to the current success.\u201d Signal of China\u2019s growing importance in car industry The new LTC plant is not just the first new car plant in the UK for a decade and the first to focus on making electric vehicles. It also represents the single biggest investment in the British automotive industry by a Chinese company. Geely saved the maker of London\u2019s black cabs from the brink of collapse in 2013. The company was founded by Li Shufu, who the business secretary described as \u201cone of China\u2019s great business leaders and therefore one of the world\u2019s great business leaders\u201d. Li set up Geely in 1986 as a fridge manufacturer, but he has gone on to build a substantial car maker in China and buy western brands such as Volvo and LTC. Representatives from the Chinese government were at the official opening of the new factory, and the presentation translated into Chinese. Chris Gubbey, LTC\u2019s chief executive, described the facility as a \u201csuccess story for the cooperation between the UK and China\u201d. \u2022 This article was amended on 27 March 2017. An earlier version said the Coventry factory was the first site in the UK dedicated to the production \u201cof electric vehicles\u201d; that should have said \u201cof electric cars\u201d.",

      "bodyText": "More than 1,000 jobs are at risk after shoe retailer Brantano collapsed into administration. The company has suffered from a rise in costs since the post-referendum fall in sterling amid a generally lacklustre UK footwear market. Based in Hinckley, Leicestershire, the chain has 73 stores and 64 concessions across the UK and employs 1,086 staff. Founded in Belgium in 1953 it expanded into the UK by buying 47 Shoe City shops in 1998. For the last few weeks the company\u2019s private equity owner, Alteri, had been attempting to sell Brantano and another footwear chain, Jones Bootmaker, which it bought along with its sister retailer for about \u00a312m in February 2015. The latter, which has 100 shops and about 800 employees, is also at risk of administration but is talking to potential buyers thought to include private equity firm Endless and footwear groups Kurt Geiger and Pavers. This is the second time Brantano has entered administration in just over a year. In 2016 Alteri put it into administration and then bought it back. Tony Barrell of PwC, who was appointed as lead administrator to Brantano on Wednesday, said: \u201cDespite significant improvements in the business and reductions in the cost base, trading has continued to suffer in a depressed and competitive footwear market. Like many other retailers, Brantano has also been hit hard by the sharp decline in sterling, the ongoing shift in consumer shopping habits and the evolution of the UK retail environment.\u201d He said Brantano would continue to trade as normal while administrators assess its strategy and interest in parts of the business. But Barrell said: \u201cRegrettably, it is inevitable that there will be redundancies. Staff will be paid their arrears of wages and salaries, and will continue to be paid for their work while the business is in administration.\u201d Specialist footwear retailers have been under pressure for a number of years as clothing chains including New Look and Primark have increased the number of shoes and boots they sell. Some major chains, including H&amp;M, have recently upped their footwear ranges, piling more pressure on specialists. Maureen Hinton, retail research director at research firm GlobalData, said: \u201cBrantano is mainly based in out-of-town stores and so had to be a destination to attract people that was always going to count against it.\u201d All retailers are under pressure from rising costs because of increases in business rates, the introduction of a minimum wage for over-25s and the fall in the value of the pound against the dollar, the currency in which many products are bought on the wholesale market. Hinton said it was harder for footwear specialists to cut employee costs because floor staff were required to fetch stock and explain shoe sizes to customers. Brantano is not the first British retail group to collapse under the control of Alteri, a group backed by US private equity firm Apollo Global Management. Last year tailoring specialist Austin Reed went into administration soon after Alteri bought its debt.",

      "bodyText": "Before we close up for the day, we\u2019ll take a look at the markets. On Wall Street, markets are mixed now trading is fully underway: Dow Jones: -0.1% at 20,643 S&amp;P 500: +0.04% at 2,345 Nasdaq: +0.2% at 5,808 European markets are also mixed, with most indices down less they were earlier. FTSE 100: -0.7% at 7,330 Germany\u2019s DAX: -0.5% at 11,908 France\u2019s CAC: -0.3% at 4,990 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB: +0.3% at 19,970 Spain\u2019s IBEX: +0.2% at 10,232 Europe\u2019s STOXX 600: -0.6% at 374 Thank you for reading the blog and for commenting. We\u2019ll be back tomorrow. Michel Barnier, the EU\u2019s chief negotiator for Brexit has set out the bloc\u2019s conditions and priorities for talks. Among the priorities cited were the need for early agreements on citizens\u2019 rights, money and borders. Guaranteeing their rights as European citizens, in the long term, will be our absolute priority from the very start of negotiations. Full story coming soon here. The Dutch government has come out in support of Jeroen Dijsselbloem after the Dutch finance minister faced calls to resign as the leader of the Eurogroup. The controversy centres on comments Dijsselbloem made to a German newspaper, which were taken as a criticism of Southern European countries. Specifically: I can\u2019t spend all my money on booze and women and then ask you for your support. Reuters quotes an official close to Dutch prime minister Mark Rutte as saying the government \u201cremains firmly behind\u201d Dijsselbloem. The official added: The position has not changed. Premier Rutte has repeatedly said we are very supportive of Dijsselbloem in his role at the Eurogroup. The Portuguese prime minister has called for Dijsselbloem\u2019s resignation. Dijsselbloem has not commented. Oil prices are at near four-month lows after the latest figures showed US crude inventories rose faster than expected, exacerbating fears of over supply. Brent crude is down 1.6% at $50.15 a barrel, and fell as low $50.05 earlier, the lowest since 30 November when OPEC countries agreed to cut output to ease oversupply fears. Figures from the American Petroleum Institute showed US inventories climbed by 4.5 million barrels to 533.6 million barrels last week, higher than analysts\u2019 forecasts of 2.8 million. US shale oil producers have been increasing the number of rigs, pushing up production. Analysts at US bank Jefferies commented in a note: OPEC\u2019s market intervention has not yet resulted in significant visible inventory drawdowns, and the financial markets have lost patience. Thames Water has been handed a record \u00a320.3m fine after huge leaks of untreated sewage. The prosecution was brought by the Environment Agency, which said the enormous volume of sewage, at 1.4bn litres, was unprecedented. It relates to numerous offences in 2013 and 2014 at sewage treatment works at Aylesbury, Didcot, Henley and Little Marlow, and a large sewage pumping station at Littlemore. Full story here: The pound appears to have lost some of the boost it gained from the sharp rise in UK inflation revealed on Tuesday. (The consumer prices index jumped more than expected to 2.3% in February from 1.8% in January, pushed higher by food and fuel prices.) The pound is still above $1.24 but down 0.3% on the day at $1.2440. It is also down 0.2% against the euro at \u20ac1.1516. Wall Street will be closely monitoring any developments in the debate on the Republican health care bill, which seeks to overturn Obamacare. The House of Representatives is expected to vote on the bill on Thursday, and failure to pass it would be a huge blow to Trump. And we\u2019re off... US markets have opened lower, but the early falls are modest: Dow Jones: -0.2% at 20,629 S&amp;P 500: -0.1% at 2,342 Nasdaq: -0.1% at 5,790 Donald Trump is awake and would like to reassure markets: Wall Street bell goes in 10 minutes... Twitter has reacted with a combination of anger and humour to those Dijsselbloem comments that appear to be critical of the behaviour of Southern European countries. The FTSE 100 is currently down 65 points or 0.9% at 7,314. The FTSE 250 is down 1.1% at 18,788. Nicholas Hyett, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, provides this lunchtime summary: A partial reversal of the so called \u2018Trump Trade\u2019 has sent defensives and precious metal producers to the top of the FTSE 100 today, as investors worry that President Trump\u2019s conflict with Congress will prevent him delivering the pro-business agenda on which he campaigned. Only six FTSE 100 stocks had made it into positive territory at lunchtime, with Randgold topping the list, up 0.8%. Despite recently warning that conditions remain challenging, hopes of an uptick in the global economy helped FTSE 250 shipping group Clarkson enjoy a strong run recently. However, with pro-Trump sentiment wavering it\u2019s perhaps unsurprising to see this bellwether of global trade lose some of the wind from its sails, sending the shares down 4.5%. Earlier the Bank of England published its latest agents\u2019 summary of business conditions. The Bank has 12 regional agents who have discussions with about 700 firms across the UK to glean the latest snapshot of conditions. The survey for the first quarter of 2017 found that growth in retail sales was slowing as the weak pounds feeds through to higher prices and reduces the spending power of consumers. Overall the report was mixed, with exports up and investment intentions picking up. Agents concluded: Moderate rates of activity growth had continued overall. Retail sales volumes growth had eased. It was expected to slow further during the year ahead as the fall in sterling fed through to higher prices, reducing households\u2019 purchasing power. In contrast, export volume growth had picked up. That was due to the fall in sterling and stronger world growth. Investment intentions had picked up, pointing to modest growth in spending in the year ahead. That reflected continued moderate demand growth and less uncertainty about economic prospects, particularly in the near term. But a lack of visibility of the United Kingdom\u2019s future trading arrangements was weighing on longer-term plans for some contacts. The fall in sterling was being passed through into higher manufacturing output and consumer goods price inflation. Business and consumer services price inflation had edged higher. Over in Brussels, Jeroen Dijsselbloem - head of the Eurogroup of finance ministers - appears to be in a spot of bother. Margrethe Vestager, the European commissioner for competition, said Dijsselbloem was \u201cwrong\u201d to make comments that were interpreted as criticism of southern European countries. Speaking to the German newspaper, Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, Dijsselbloem said: In the euro crisis, the northern eurozone states demonstrated solidarity with the countries in crisis. As a Social Democrat, I believe solidarity is extremely important. But whoever demands it also has obligations. I can\u2019t spend all my money on booze and women and then ask you for your support. This principle holds at personal, local, national and even European levels. His comments drew strong criticism in Spain and Italy and the Portuguese prime minister called for Dijsselbloem\u2019s resignation. A spokesman for Dijsselbloem defended his comments along the following lines: He didn\u2019t refer to any specific country or group of countries. His message was that solidarity comes with obligations, and the message was for all eurozone countries. Now for some news from Coventry, where the grand opening of the first new car plant in Britain for more than a decade is taking place today. The London Taxi Company (LTC), maker of the famous London black cab, will build electric cabs at the plant, creating more than 1,000 jobs. It is being funded by a \u00a3300m investment from China\u2019s Zhejiang Geely Holding Group, owner of LTC, plus a \u00a316.1m government grant. As well as being a boost for Coventry it\u2019s a boost for the UK automotive industry, which backed the remain camp in the EU referendum and has voiced concerns that Brexit will lead foreign investment elsewhere. The business secretary Greg Clarke said the new factory, where research and development will also take place, showed that the UK was a \u201cworld leader in the development of new automotive technologies\u201d. Read our full story on the new plant here: Global equities could have quite a bit further to fall according to analysts at Saxo Bank, as Trump\u2019s pro-growth policies hit several hurdles along the way. Peter Garnry, the bank\u2019s head of equity strategy, explains: So much of the narrative has revolved around US president Donald Trump since his election on November 8 but the conviction in the reflation trade faded abruptly in the last US session with the S&amp;P 500 declining more than 1% for the first time since October. So what are we to make of all of this? Where do we go from here? Global equities could easily fall 5-10% in what would be a normal healthy technical correction. And the selloff will be driven by cyclicals: financials, materials, consumer discretionary - a big question mark here is whether technology stocks will hold the line. We see further upside in volatility as markets are now constructing a new narrative that essentially centres on the likelihood that the pro-growth Trump policies or set for a bumpy road with many road blocks . Credit growth has stalled lately and the energy impulse into inflation is gone by June. Gold is benefitting from the widespread equities sell-off and weaker dollar. Spot gold touched a three-week high of $1,248.47 per ounce, and is currently up 0.1% at $1,245. Edward Meir, analyst at INTL FCStone said gold would continue to benefit while investors sold shares: It seems that equity investors decided to take some money of the table, perhaps getting slightly wary about the progress in President Trump\u2019s legislative agenda. Gold will likely continue to rally going into Wednesday\u2019s session as Tuesday\u2019s US stock market sell-off was significant and will likely have a knock-on effect on international equity markets over the next 24 hours. Some people are feeling the pinch more than others of course. A report by the Equality Trust found that the average FTSE bosses earns 386 times more than a worker on the national living wage. Taking 2015 annual reports from all FTSE 100 companies, the charity calculated that chief executives were paid \u00a35.3m a year, compared with \u00a313,662 for someone on the national living wage of \u00a37.20 an hour. Here is the full story from the Guardian\u2019s Katie Allen: Investors are not the only ones feeling pessimistic. UK households are the most downbeat about prospects for their finances since November 2013 according to the Markit Household Finance Index. Families are starting to feel the pinch of rising inflation, as everyday goods get more expensive and wage growth remains weak. It suggests that consumer spending - the main driver of UK growth currently - will start to weaken as households become more cost conscious. Tim Moore, senior economist at IHS Markit, explains: UK households reported greater pressure on their financial wellbeing in March, as rising inflation has started to erode incomes and reduce cash available to spend. On average in the first quarter of 2017 survey respondents have reported the sharpest increase in their everyday living costs for three-and-a-half years. A combination of rising inflation and subdued pay trends has forced households to recalibrate their expectations for the year ahead. After holding steady last summer, UK consumers are now more downbeat about their financial outlook than at any time since late-2013. Expectations for finances in the next month fell to 45.3 on the index in March, from 48.1 in February, where anything below 50 signals contraction. People living in the East Midlands were the most downbeat about their financial outlook, followed by those in the North East and London. Meanwhile 58% of households expected the Bank of England to raise interest rates in the next 12 months. US futures suggest the sell-off on Wall Street is likely to continue when markets open later: Dow Jones futures: -0.3% Nasdaq futures: -0.2% Is this the end of the Trump rally, asks David Morrison, senior market strategist at Spread Co? European stock indices are weaker across the board this morning. Investors are responding to last night\u2019s sell-off on Wall Street which saw the majors close out on their lows. Not only that, but US stock index futures are weaker again this morning. Yesterday\u2019s sharp reversal took many investors by surprise, particularly as the US session opened with fresh all-time highs for Facebook and the Nasdaq index. Unfortunately for traders, much of yesterday\u2019s move was down to political factors rather than market technicals. There are fears that the Trump administration won\u2019t have enough votes to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act when it goes to Congress tomorrow. There are thought to be around 26 Republican representatives who oppose their party\u2019s new health care bill. This in turn could jeopardise Trump\u2019s tax plan and this has worried investors who have watched equities soar on the promise of fiscal stimulus. The final scores in Asia: Back in the UK, estate agent Savills has published results. Shares are currently down 1.8%. Julia Kollewe reports: Savills, the upmarket estate agent, has posted annual pretax profits of nearly \u00a3100m, up 1%, despite \u201cgeopolitical distractions\u201d and higher property taxes in the UK and elsewhere. The Brexit vote in June pushed revenues from its UK residential business down 3% to \u00a3124m last year. The firm explained: \u201cA very strong first quarter, as buyers rushed to beat the increased stamp duty on second homes, was followed by low trading volumes in advance of the Brexit referendum at the end of June. Then a relatively quiet, but encouraging summer gave rise to a strong autumn selling season albeit with a slowing of transactions in December.\u201d Savills said the sharp decline in the value of sterling since the referendum had drawn overseas buyers at the top end of the market. The average selling price in London increased slightly to \u00a32.9m because the firm sold more properties worth \u00a320m or more than in 2015. But it still recorded 5% fewer sales overall, while the market suffered even bigger declines. Outside London there was a 7% increase in exchanges. US bond yields are at three-week lows as investors dump equities in favour of lower-risk assets. The yield on benchmark 10-year US treasuries - an indicator of how much it costs the government to borrow from the financial markets - fell to 2.4%. Kingfisher, the company behind B&amp;Q and Screwfix, is the biggest faller on the FTSE 100 this morning following the publication of annual results. My colleague Julia Kollewe reports: Shares in Kingfisher fell 4.8% despite better-than-expected results. The retailer warned of modest price increases and expressed concern that uncertainty around French and British politics could hit demand for its DIY products. Chief executive V\u00e9ronique Laury, who is overseeing a five-year revamp of the business, said: \u201cLooking forward, the EU referendum has created uncertainty for the UK economic outlook and we remain cautious on the outlook for France, especially in light of the forthcoming presidential elections.\u201d The company beat City forecasts with a 14.7% rise in annual underlying pretax profit to \u00a3787m. A good performance in the UK &amp; Ireland, where like-for-like sales rose 5.9%, offset a 2.7% sales drop in France, where it trades as Castorama and Brico D\u00e9p\u00f4t. The retailer\u2019s chairman Daniel Bernard is to step down in June after eight years in the role. He will be succeeded by Andy Cosslett, the former chief executive of InterContinental Hotels Group and Fitness First, who previously worked at Unilever and Cadbury Schweppes. He also chairs Rugby Football Union. Investors are not happy at all this morning. Losses are widening across Europe on fears that Trump is not going to be able to deliver on his policy pledges. Much of the optimism about his policies to boost US (and therefore global) growth has already been priced into markets since his election, with Wall Street and European markets hitting record highs. But as President Trump deals with the reality of governing, it seems determination alone is not enough to push through his flagship policies. If Trump hasn\u2019t yet managed to overhaul Obamacare - his key priority - won\u2019t his promises on tax giveaways and infrastructure spending get kicked into the long grass? Connor Campbell, analyst at Spreadex, says markets are in a \u201csour mood\u201d: Based on the mess Republicans are making of their healthcare reforms it seems increasingly unlikely that the Wotsit-in-Chief will be able to deliver on his sweeping tax changes and $1 trillion infrastructure spending. Combine that with the Wall Street Journal, a notably right-leaning publication, claiming that if Trump doesn\u2019t \u2018show more respect for the truth\u2019 then \u2018most Americans may conclude he\u2019s a fake president\u2019, and the optimism that caused investors to flock to the major indices has been seriously undermined by, well, Trump himself. The FTSE 100 is down 72 points as the negative sentiment spreads. The mining sector and financials are taking the brunt of it. Current scores on the board: FTSE 100: -1% at 7,306 Germany\u2019s DAX: -0.8% at 11,871 France\u2019s CAC: -0.8% at 4,963 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB: -1.1% at 19,706 Spain\u2019s IBEX: -0.9% at 10,126 Europe\u2019s STOXX 600: -0.8% at 373 The pound is just about holding on to the gains it made against the dollar on Tuesday following the sharp rise in UK inflation to 2.3% in February from 1.8%. In theory, the acceleration of inflation brings forward the prospect of a UK interest rate rise and adds weight to the decision by Kristin Forbes - member of the Bank of England\u2019s Monetary Policy Committee - to vote for a hike at the March meeting (she was outvoted). The pound is also being supported by dollar weakness, and is currently flat at $1.2477. It is also up 0.1% against the euro at \u20ac1.1550. European markets have opened lower, as fears ripple across the Atlantic over Trump\u2019s ability to push through growth-boosting policies: FTSE 100: -0.6% Germany\u2019s DAX: -0.8% France\u2019s CAC: -0.7% Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB: -0.9% Spain\u2019s IBEX: -0.7% Europe\u2019s STOXX 600: -0.3% Nouriel Roubini, the economist who is probably best known for predicting the global financial crisis, has also warned on Trump\u2019s policies. Specifically, the professor at NYU\u2019s Stern School of Business, says markets have over-estimated how many beneficial policies the President can carry through, while underestimating the potential negatives. Roubini told CNBC: [Markets] are overestimating the positives of the US-Trump policies. Infrastructure, stimulus, deregulation, tax cuts: I think Trump will achieve much less on those dimensions. And they\u2019re underestimating the risk that the US protectionist policies are going to lead to trade wars, that the restrictions on immigration are going to slow down labor supply, and that micromanaging the corporate sector is going to be negative. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Shares in Asia are down sharply this morning following Wall Street\u2019s worst day this year. It appears that hopes are evaporating of swift action on the growth-boosting policies promised by President Trump. With much of the upside already priced in, investors are now coming to the realisation that for all the talk, it might take longer than expected to push through reforms. Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK, explains: After the S&amp;P 500 posted its biggest one day fall since last October last year, the question being asked is whether the scales are starting to fall away from investor\u2019s eyes as to whether President Trump will be able to deliver anything close to what has been priced into markets since his election last November. Even the mistiest eyed optimist appears to be coming to the realisation that even on health care, where there is some form of consensus, reforms are likely to take a lot longer than realised and as such any other programmes like tax and banking reform and infrastructure spending are likely to get pushed further out into the future. Here is how US markets closed: Dow Jones: -1.1% at 20,668 S&amp;P 500: -1.2% at 2,344 Nasdaq: -1.5% at 5,333 And in Asia: Hang Seng: -1.3% at 24,275 Nikkei: -2% at 19,041 Topix: -2% at 1,530 Shares in Europe are expected to open lower this morning: We will be tracking all the key developments.",

      "bodyText": "Fans of Heineken beers including Amstel, Sol and Kingfisher will not be able to find them in Tesco for the foreseeable future after the supermarket refused to accept price increases the brewer blamed on Brexit and the budget. Several of Heineken\u2019s brands have been absent from Tesco shelves for six weeks after annual talks over pricing ended in a stalemate. In total, 24 out of 53 Heineken brands are affected, with eight pulled from the shelves altogether. Heineken is understood to have argued that inflation since the Brexit referendum has pushed up its costs, echoing the argument made by Unilever in its dispute with Tesco over the price of Marmite last autumn. The brewer has also faced unexpected pressure from a surprisingly stiff increase in alcohol taxes in the budget earlier this month. Philip Hammond raised beer duty in line with the retail price index measure of inflation, but used a forecast rate of 3.9%, rather than the current RPI level of 3.2%. The higher-than-expected duty rise, coupled with increased costs for bottles, packaging and fuel because of the pound\u2019s slump since the EU referendum, is understood to be behind the Heineken\u2019s decision to ask for higher prices. Tesco\u2019s refusal to pay more means it will no longer stock Tiger, Amstel, Sol, Kingfisher, Birra Moretti, Blind Pig Cider, Fosters Gold and Fosters Radler. It will also stop stocking larger pack sizes for 16 other beer brands including Heineken, Fosters, Strongbow, Kronenbourg 1664 and Newcastle Brown Ale. The two companies are not expected to reach a compromise agreement over pricing in the near future. The dispute has not proved hostile, however, with Tesco agreeing in the last few weeks to start stocking Heineken\u2019s new zero-alcohol beer. A spokesperson for Heineken said: \u201cWe don\u2019t comment on commercial arrangements with our customers. \u201cShoppers will continue to find a broad range of our fantastic beer and cider brands in Tesco.\u201d A spokesperson for Tesco said: \u201cWe frequently review our ranges to ensure they meet the needs of customers. We continue to offer customers a great range of beer, lager and cider.\u201d Heineken\u2019s bid to raise prices for its products in supermarkets comes just a few months after it put 6p on a pint in pubs, a decision it blamed on the weak pound.",

      "bodyText": "Plusnet, the BT-owned broadband and landline company, has been fined almost \u00a3900,000 by Ofcom for continuing to charge more than 1,000 customers even though they had cancelled their accounts. The telecoms regulator fined Plusnet \u00a3880,000 after an investigation found that the BT subsidiary broke a \u201cfundamental billing rule\u201d. An error in the company\u2019s billing system meant cancelled lines were still recognised as \u201clive\u201d. As a result, 1,025 customers who had cancelled either their landline or broadband service continued to be billed and were charged more than \u00a3500,000 in total. Plusnet, which is based in Yorkshire, apologised, saying it was an \u201cisolated historical issue\u201d. \u201cWe are very sorry and would like to apologise to the 1,025 customers affected,\u201d said a spokeswoman for Plusnet. \u201cWe reported this ourselves to Ofcom, and made every effort to contact these customers to arrange a full refund before the investigation started. We would also like to reassure all customers this was an isolated historical issue and we have implemented a number of new robust measures to make sure this doesn\u2019t happen again.\u201d However, Ofcom, which regulates the UK media and telecommunications industry, said there could be no excuses when it came to charging the public for services. \u201cThere can be no margin for error, and no excuses, when it comes to billing customers correctly,\u201d said Lindsey Fussell, consumer group director at Ofcom. \u201cThis fine should serve as a reminder to telecoms companies that they must adhere to Ofcom\u2019s billing rules at all times, or face the consequences.\u201d Plusnet has made repeated attempts to refund all affected former customers by letter and phone but has only tracked down 356, paying out a total of \u00a3212,140, including 4% interest. The rest has been donated to a dozen charities in Yorkshire, where the company is based. \u201cWhilst it is reassuring that Plusnet has sought to address the issue, that\u2019ll be little comfort to the two-thirds affected that are still out of pocket,\u201d said Richard Neudegg, head of regulation at price comparison service uSwitch. \u201cOfcom\u2019s decision to hand an \u00a3880,000 fine to Plusnet is yet another reminder to providers that the regulator will not tolerate billing mistakes.\u201d He added: \u201cCustomers need to have confidence that providers are getting it right. For those that have ended their contract they need to be reassured that no further money will be taken for a service they have ceased to used.\u201d Ofcom said it cut what would have been a \u00a31m-plus fine by 20% to \u201creflect Plusnet\u2019s willingness to enter a formal settlement\u201d. The hefty fine is the latest headache for Gavin Patterson, the chief executive of BT, who has endured a torrid year that has included an accounting scandal at its Italian operation that wiped \u00a38bn off its shares. Earlier this month BT, which is set to introduce inflation-busting price rises for its customers, denied that it is forcing them to foot the bill to pay for its new \u00a31.2bn Champions League football rights deal. Patterson recently notched up a significant victory striking a deal to legally separate Openreach, which controls the UK\u2019s broadband network, after almost two years of wrangling with Ofcom. Ofcom, which has wanted to strengthen Openreach\u2019s independence to promote competition and boost superfast broadband, has dropped its threat to call in European regulators.",

The governor dismissed the unexpectedly sharp rise in the cost of living as a \u201csingle data point\u201d when quizzed about it at a conference on ethics in banking held at the Bank of England. \u201cWe are talking about much bigger issues\u201d, Carney added. There\u2019s little doubt that voters are unhappy about the morals \u2013 or lack of them \u2013 of those working in the financial services industry. But they are also concerned about living standards. After the latest rise, the annual rate of inflation is the same as annual growth in average earnings. Next month, wages will lag behind prices and real incomes will start falling. For millions of voters, there are not many bigger issues than that. In truth, of course, Carney is more concerned about inflation than his apparent nonchalance would suggest. A combination of a rebound in oil prices and the fall in the pound since the EU referendum has resulted in a steady increase in inflation since the middle of last year, and there are more price rises in the pipeline. Competition between retailers will help keep inflation in check but the double whammy from energy prices and sterling could hardly have come at a worse time, since businesses are already having to cope with a higher minimum wage, pension auto-enrolment and the apprenticeship levy. Inflation is on course to hit 3% later this year. The pound rose on the currency markets on the possibility that interest rates will go up sooner than expected. That still looks premature given the lack of price pressure. Indeed, the squeeze on real incomes is likely to bear down on consumer spending over the coming months, and this will eventually feed through into lower inflation. But Carney will have to justify the Bank\u2019s inactivity as inflation moves further above its target during the spring or summer. He could argue that Threadneedle Street does not need to raise interest rates when the economy is set to slow anyway.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Most of Britain\u2019s millionaires reckon Brexit will make them even richer, according to a survey by wealth managers at Swiss bank UBS. A poll of more than 400 Britons with at least $1m (\u00a3800,000) in liquid assets in addition to their homes found that 78% thought Britain\u2019s decision to leave the EU would have a \u201cpositive effect\u201d on their financial plans. Nick Tucker, UK head of UBS Wealth Management, said many of the bank\u2019s clients were anxious about the effects of Brexit on their finances but most of the richest of the rich were \u201cnow taking a more positive view\u201d. \u201cUBS Wealth Management doesn\u2019t take a political view on Brexit,\u201d Tucker said. \u201cBut our client conversations around the country have revealed significant levels of anxiety. This latest data of UK millionaires suggests a more complex picture. Over the longer term, most are now taking a positive view.\u201d The survey, published a week before Theresa May will pull the trigger on article 50 \u2013 the two-year process of Britain exiting the EU \u2013 found that young millionaires are even more bullish on Britain\u2019s future outside of the bloc. UBS found that 83% of millionaires aged 18 to34 thought Brexit would have a positive impact on their long-term financial planning. This compared with 70% of 35- to 44-year-olds feeling positive about the impact of Brexit on their finances, and 74% of over-64-year-olds. According to polling data from YouGov, 75% of 18- to 24-year-olds voted to remain in the EU. Three-quarters of the millionaires surveyed by UBS said they thought Brexit would have a positive impact on the overall UK economy in the long term, despite the collapse in the value of the pound since the referendum and concerns that it may be more difficult for the UK to trade goods and service after it leaves the EU. However, Tucker said that despite being bullish about their personal finances in a post-EU world, rich people are holding an increasing amount of their wealth in cash to give them more flexibility in case of any financial shocks. \u201cWe still see many investors holding on to cash, rather than investing,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is especially true of younger investors. In an environment of returning inflation and low interest rates, we recommend looking for investments with a higher return \u2013 whether in the UK or around the world. \u201cUK assets have proven more resilient than feared and we expect this trend to continue in the coming months. Even with this positive picture, and the bullish confidence we see on Brexit, investors should still look for a balanced portfolio, rather than sticking all their eggs in this one British basket.\u201d The global super-rich are expected to continue to flock to London despite Brexit, according to a recent report by property consultants Knight Frank. The number of UK-based ultra high-net-worth individuals \u2013 those with more than $30m (\u00a324.2m) in assets \u2013 is expected to increase by 30% to 12,310 over the next decade. Liam Bailey, Knight Frank\u2019s head of research, said London would remain \u201cthe city of choice\u201d for the super-rich from Asia and the Middle East despite concerns over Brexit. \u201cIn a European context, London is without doubt the dominant city for the wealthy,\u201d he said. \u201cLondon is just more accessible for more wealthy people, it is more convenient, more connected and more open than other cities. London attracts talent from around the world, and it will continue to do so.\u201d Bailey said Brexit may have some impact on London\u2019s global appeal, but the UK\u2019s membership of the EU was less important for the world\u2019s richest people than the general population.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The average FTSE chief executive earns 386 times more than a worker on the national living wage, according to an analysis published by the Equality Trust as it steps up its campaign for new government rules to expose pay gaps. The charity used annual reports from 2015 for all the companies in the FTSE 100 to calculate that their CEOs pocket an average of \u00a35.3m each year, compared with \u00a313,662 for someone on the national living wage of \u00a37.20 an hour. The trust issues its findings amid growing worries over a squeeze on living standards from sluggish pay growth and rising inflation. The pressures on households stem partly from Brexit worries knocking the pound lower and raising the price of imports to the UK. Those factors underscore the challenge for Theresa May to take the UK out of the EU while vowing to cut inequality and create an economy that \u201cworks for everyone\u201d. Chiming with research by other groups that suggests the squeeze will accentuate inequality, the trust found more than two-thirds (67%) of FTSE 100 CEOs were paid more than 100 times the average UK salary. It is calling on the government to force large and medium firms to report the pay gap between their highest and average paid employee. \u201cWe need far greater transparency on company pay practices to challenge poverty pay and executive excess at the same time,\u201d said equality trust executive director Wanda Wyporska. \u201cOnly then can we create a sense of trust and common purpose essential to build an economy and society that works for all.\u201d The trust\u2019s \u201cpay tracker\u201d report highlights the big gaps between FTSE bosses such as Sir Martin Sorrell of advertising firm WPP, who was awarded more than \u00a340m in 2016, and public sector workers, who have seen their incomes squeezed by years of austerity. The Equality Trust analysis found that FTSE 100 chief executives are now paid 165 times more than a nurse, 140 times more than a teacher, 132 times more than a police officer and 312 times more than a care worker. \u201cThe people who educate our children, look after our grandparents, and keep our families safe have seen their pay frozen, while fat cat CEOs continue to gorge themselves on obscene and undeserved rewards,\u201d said Wyporska. \u201cPay inequality drives wider inequality, and we know this is bad for businesses, bad for our economy and bad for our health, our education and our wider society.\u201d A spokesman for the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy said: \u201cWe are committed to creating an economy that works for everyone, and that\u2019s why we have consulted on options to strengthen corporate governance. \u201cThe green paper set out a range of options to address concerns around levels of executive pay. We are considering the responses received and will respond in due course.\u201d \u2022 This story\u2019s headline was amended on 22 March 2016 to clarify that the figures apply to FTSE 100 chief executives, and not all UK CEOs",

Those factors underscore the challenge for Theresa May to take the UK out of the EU while vowing to cut inequality and create an economy that \u201cworks for everyone\u201d.</p> <p>Chiming with research by other groups that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/jan/31/theresa-may-inequality-margaret-thatcher-resolution-foundation\">suggests the squeeze will accentuate inequality</a>, the trust found more than two-thirds (67%) of FTSE 100 CEOs were paid more than 100 times the average UK salary. </p> <p>It is <a href=\"https://equalitytrust.eaction.org.uk/petition/fatcats\">calling on the government to force large and medium firms to report the pay gap</a> between their highest and average paid employee.</p> <p>\u201cWe need far greater transparency on company pay practices to challenge poverty pay and executive excess at the same time,\u201d said equality trust executive director Wanda Wyporska.</p> <p>\u201cOnly then can we create a sense of trust and common purpose essential to build an economy and society that works for all.\u201d<br></p> <p>The trust\u2019s \u201cpay tracker\u201d report highlights the big gaps between FTSE bosses such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/sir-martin-sorrell\">Sir Martin Sorrell</a> of advertising firm WPP, who was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/mar/09/sir-martin-sorrell-earnings-wpp-chief-executive-ftse-100\">awarded more than \u00a340m in 2016</a>, and public sector workers, who have seen their incomes squeezed by years of austerity. </p> <p>The Equality Trust analysis found that FTSE 100 chief executives are now paid 165 times more than a nurse, 140 times more than a teacher, 132 times more than a police officer and 312 times more than a care worker.</p> <p>\u201cThe people who educate our children, look after our grandparents, and keep our families safe have seen their pay frozen, while fat cat CEOs continue to gorge themselves on obscene and undeserved rewards,\u201d said Wyporska. </p> <p>\u201cPay inequality drives wider inequality, and we know this is bad for businesses, bad for our economy and bad for our health, our education and our wider society.\u201d</p> <p>A spokesman for the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy said: \u201cWe are committed to creating an economy that works for everyone, and that\u2019s why we have consulted on options to strengthen corporate governance. </p> <p>\u201cThe green paper set out a range of options to address concerns around levels of executive pay. We are considering the responses received and will respond in due course.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 This story\u2019s headline was amended on 22 March 2016 to clarify that the figures apply to FTSE 100 chief executives, and not all UK CEOs</p>",

      "bodyText": "Concerns about the Trump administration\u2019s ability to push through key reforms and deliver on a promised fiscal boost turned share markets across the Asia Pacific region into a sea of red on Wednesday. As investors dumped risky assets and rushed to safe havens such as gold and government bonds, the worries were amplified by a strongly worded editorial in the Wall Street Journal published on Wednesday. The newspaper, which is owned by Rupert Murdoch\u2019s media empire, said the US president\u2019s unsubstantiated claims that he was bugged by his predecessor Barack Obama had undermined his credibility, a situation worsened by his failure to back down. \u201cYet the President clings to his assertion like a drunk to an empty gin bottle, rolling out his press spokesman to make more dubious claims,\u201d the editorial said. The editorial board concluded: \u201cIf he doesn\u2019t show more respect for the truth, most Americans may conclude he\u2019s a fake president.\u201d Wall Street suffered its biggest fall for five months on Tuesday and the selling frenzy continued in Asia with Japan and Australia the biggest losers. The Nikkei was down nearly 2% while the ASX200 in Sydney fell 1.6%, its sharpest one day fall since the day of Trump\u2019s election in November, with the big banks and miners among the worst performers. The jitters looked set to continue into the UK and European session on Wednesday with futures trading pointing to a 0.7% fall in the FTSE100 when it opens. Investors view the Trump administration\u2019s struggles to push through its healthcare overhaul through congress as a bad omen for promised tax cuts. Ric Spooner of CMC markets in Sydney said: \u201cNervousness in international markets was driven by concerns over whether the US administration will be able to achieve the planned wind back of Obamacare and if not, what this means for its broader fiscal strategy.\u201d With investor mood decidedly risk-averse, the Japanese yen scored some chunky gains against the US dollar, rising to a four-month high of 111.63. The greenback fell below a key level of 100 against a trade-weighted basket of its peers. Bonds gained with yields on two-year U.S. debt falling to 1.27% in overnight trades, retreating further from a 7-1/2 year high of 1.38% hit last Wednesday when the US Federal Reserve raised interest rates. Gold was on track to extend its overnight strong performance with the precious commodity perched comfortably at a two-week high of $1,248 per ounce. Commodities other than gold, however, have had a rough outing with copper and iron ore prices down by more than one percent each. Oil prices declined as concerns about new supply overshadowed the latest talk by OPEC that it was looking to extend output cuts.",
