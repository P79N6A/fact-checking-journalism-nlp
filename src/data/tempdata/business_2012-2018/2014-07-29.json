The activist investor is the one who accumulated a similar holding in investment manager F&amp;C, got elected chairman and led a so-so revival. On the other hand, sometimes he buys and does nothing. He sat silently on a smaller stake in 3i, the buyout firm, and then sold at a tidy profit. At Electra, Bramson has finally moved. Sort of. He wants three seats on the board and the right to conduct a strategic review. But this news was conveyed not by him but by the board of Electra, which rejected the demands at a meeting last week. Rejection was the correct response: a 19% stake gets you an audience, but minority investors don't generally have an automatic right to board seats. If Bramson thinks Electra has a strategic problem requiring a review, he should share his thoughts. On the face of it, there's nothing wrong with this investment trust. In private equity land, it is a rarity in meeting its long-term investment goals. Unlike 3i, Candover and SVG, it didn't crumble in the financial crisis. Over the past decade, Electra has produced an average 14% return on equity a year, within its target of 10% to 15%. What's not to like? Perhaps Bramson objects to the fees paid to Electra Partners, the trust's manager. At 1.5% a year, plus 18% over an investment hurdle, they are hardly paupers' rates, but they are also the norm in this industry. Or is Bramson bothered by Electra's discount to asset value? But, at 9%, it is lower than most peers'. Or the lack of dividend? But Electra has always been structured for capital gains. Whatever it is, Bramson should speak up. If he has a bright idea, he should table a proposal and see if other shareholders salute. Otherwise co-shareholders, and the board, will suspect an ugly attempt to gain creeping control.

      "bodyText": "Rising interest rates in advanced economies and a slowdown in emerging markets could combine to cut global growth by as much as 2%, the International Monetary Fund has warned. Its latest report into how policy moves in one country can spill over into others also highlights the threat that tensions in Russia and Ukraine could send shockwaves through financial and commodity markets across Europe, central Asia and beyond. The IMF's main concerns, however, centre around two key factors emerging as the global economy \"shifts from crisis to recovery mode\". It highlights the challenge for central banks of smoothly unwinding the ultraloose monetary policy they brought in to support advanced economies during the financial crisis. Secondly, it warns that emerging market economies are slowing in a \"synchronised and protracted manner\" and that poses risks to the rest of the world in terms of trade and finance. The report is the latest to emphasise the complex task of returning to more normal interest rates after years of extraordinary measures to shore up markets and confidence. In the UK, base rates have been at a record low of 0.5% for more than five years while in both the US and UK there have been vast money printing schemes, known as quantitative easing. The IMF said there was a risk that rising interest rates could compound the pressure on the global economy from slowing emerging markets, where average GDP growth is projected to fall from 7% pre-crisis to 5% over the next five years. \"Markets may reassess growth prospects in emerging markets if there are renewed bouts of financial turbulence as advanced economies normalise monetary policy,\" said report author Hamid Faruqee. \"A downside scenario of sharply tighter financial conditions alongside a further weakening of emerging market growth would be damaging for the global economy \u2013 lowering output by about 2%,\" his report added. The fund called for stronger policy action at both national and global levels to avert such a scenario. But the report also says not all spillovers are negative and if financial conditions tighten for the right reasons the effects could be positive. When advanced economies normalise monetary policy as their economic outlook improves, it will tend to tighten financial conditions globally, but the accompanying boost to growth should potentially offset the negative effects of tighter borrowing costs, the report said. \"In other words, faster growth in advanced economies \u2013 which translates into higher external demand \u2013 could be good for other economies, if managed well,\" it explained. \"On the other hand, if the tightening of monetary conditions is not driven by higher growth but is instead triggered by, for example, financial stability concerns, spillovers could have a negative impact on growth elsewhere, especially in vulnerable emerging economies.\" It also warned about the swings in exchange rates between currencies if policy is tightened at different times in different countries.

The latest deadline marks the end of a 30-day grace period beyond which the latest instalment was due to the creditors who restructured in 2005 and 2010, also known as exchange bondholders.</p> <p>Argentina has suffered a number of setbacks in US courts, the latest being last month when the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jun/16/argentina-debt-crisis-fears-us-supreme-court-ruling\" title=\"\">US supreme court refused to hear an appeal</a> against a lower court's rulingthat came down in favour of the holdout creditors.</p> <p>The country's president, Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez de Kirchner, fears that any deal to pay more to the hedge funds could trigger lawsuits from other bondholders demanding to be paid on similar terms. Her government estimates that the liability could run as high as $15bn.</p> <p>Debt campaigners have said that the rulings in the US have implications well beyond Argentina by undoing years of progress in reducing debt burdens on poor countries. They say a victory for the holdouts would set a precedent for other investors to wreck long-standing debt forgiveness deals with developing countries.</p> <h2>Ministers relaxed about prospect of default</h2> <p>As Argentina stares down the barrel of a default, the government of President Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez seems unperturbed by its likely economic consequences. It is almost relishing what it sees as a valiant stand against capitalist imperialism by refusing to pay the holdouts.</p> <p>\"Cristina has grown with this as [General] Galtieri did during the Falkands War,\" said opposition leader Elisa Carri\u00f3. \"We Argentines love to applaud this kind of behaviour, but afterwards we end up crying.\"</p> <p>Buenos Aires awoke on Tuesday to billboards reading \"Griesa or Cristina\", in reference to New York Judge Thomas Griesa, who has ordered Argentina to pay the holdouts. Meanwhile, the government maintains that the likely default will have no negative consequences.</p> <p>\"We are not going to have any problem on the 30th,\" said Axel Kiciloff, Argentina's economy minister. Speaking at a meeting of South American economy ministers in Buenos Aires, he blamed Argentina's current crisis on \"attacks by speculators supported by central nations. We will not give in to blackmail.\" He described Griesa's ruling as \"unprecedented, unheard of, incomprehensible and uncompliable\". The court-sponsored mediation talks with the holdouts that he attended in New York he described as \"a jigsaw puzzle, a tongue twister\".</p> <p>Business leaders disagree. \"We have a minister who says it's the same whether we go into default or not,\" said H\u00e9ctor M\u00e9ndez, head of the UIA industrial union. \"The economy is in bad shape. All sectors of industry are showing important slowdowns, with an average of 25%.\"</p> <p>A survey of Argentine business leaders found that the outlook of 51% of respondents was negative. Carri\u00f3, a legislator of the middle-of-the-road UNEN political party, last night laughed off the government's claim that there can be no real default because it has paid restructured bond holders.</p> <p>\"We owe the grocer, but we also owe the butcher,\" said Carri\u00f3. \"The butcher is very mean, but we owe him. Cristina [Fern\u00e1ndez] say she already paid, but who did you pay? You paid the grocer, but if you don't pay the butcher as well they won't unblock your funds. What Cristina doesn't take into account is the amount of poverty she will be creating with her whimsical behaviour.\"</p> <p><strong>Uki Goni</strong></p>",

Argentina has suffered a number of setbacks in US courts, the latest being last month when the US supreme court refused to hear an appeal against a lower court's rulingthat came down in favour of the holdout creditors. The country's president, Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez de Kirchner, fears that any deal to pay more to the hedge funds could trigger lawsuits from other bondholders demanding to be paid on similar terms. Her government estimates that the liability could run as high as $15bn. Debt campaigners have said that the rulings in the US have implications well beyond Argentina by undoing years of progress in reducing debt burdens on poor countries. They say a victory for the holdouts would set a precedent for other investors to wreck long-standing debt forgiveness deals with developing countries. Ministers relaxed about prospect of default As Argentina stares down the barrel of a default, the government of President Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez seems unperturbed by its likely economic consequences. It is almost relishing what it sees as a valiant stand against capitalist imperialism by refusing to pay the holdouts. \"Cristina has grown with this as [General] Galtieri did during the Falkands War,\" said opposition leader Elisa Carri\u00f3. \"We Argentines love to applaud this kind of behaviour, but afterwards we end up crying.\" Buenos Aires awoke on Tuesday to billboards reading \"Griesa or Cristina\", in reference to New York Judge Thomas Griesa, who has ordered Argentina to pay the holdouts. Meanwhile, the government maintains that the likely default will have no negative consequences. \"We are not going to have any problem on the 30th,\" said Axel Kiciloff, Argentina's economy minister. Speaking at a meeting of South American economy ministers in Buenos Aires, he blamed Argentina's current crisis on \"attacks by speculators supported by central nations. We will not give in to blackmail.\" He described Griesa's ruling as \"unprecedented, unheard of, incomprehensible and uncompliable\". The court-sponsored mediation talks with the holdouts that he attended in New York he described as \"a jigsaw puzzle, a tongue twister\". Business leaders disagree. \"We have a minister who says it's the same whether we go into default or not,\" said H\u00e9ctor M\u00e9ndez, head of the UIA industrial union. \"The economy is in bad shape. All sectors of industry are showing important slowdowns, with an average of 25%.\" A survey of Argentine business leaders found that the outlook of 51% of respondents was negative. Carri\u00f3, a legislator of the middle-of-the-road UNEN political party, last night laughed off the government's claim that there can be no real default because it has paid restructured bond holders. \"We owe the grocer, but we also owe the butcher,\" said Carri\u00f3. \"The butcher is very mean, but we owe him. Cristina [Fern\u00e1ndez] say she already paid, but who did you pay? You paid the grocer, but if you don't pay the butcher as well they won't unblock your funds. What Cristina doesn't take into account is the amount of poverty she will be creating with her whimsical behaviour.\" Uki Goni",

Peter Micek of Access said: \"Vodafone have already called for an end to unfettered access. Put some action behind those words and announce five years from not that it's no longer happening.\" Asked about protests in Vodafone high street stores by the tax campaign group UK Uncut, which has questioned the firm's lack of corporation tax payments in the UK, Kleisterlee said: \"Protesters are aiming at the wrong target because they are ill-informed. It's totally unjustified, we don't deserve that treatment. If people based their action on information and not emotions this will go away.\" In a packed shareholder meeting, the audience expressed anger at a share consolidation which for many has resulted in dividend payments halving. There were calls for the resignation remuneration committee chairman, Luc Vandevelde, a former Marks &amp; Spencer boss, on the grounds that he has been a director for more than 10 years and can no longer be considered independent. While motions on Vodafone's pay policies, which saw the chief executive, Vittorio Colao, collect \u00a39m in the year to March, were approved by more than 95% of votes cast, pensioners criticised the drop in their dividend income. Vodafone halved the number of shares in issue after paying out a windfall from the sale of its stake in America's Verizon mobile network. Despite an increase in the dividend, this year the company will pay an estimated \u00a33.6bn in cash in dividends, compared to \u00a35bn last year. A pensioner who bought shares in Vodafone for 185p seven years ago \u2013 they are now worth 202p after the consolidation \u2013 said: \"I'm getting half the dividend because I've got half the shares. I bought Vodafone shares seven years ago hoping I would make a profit. I can't see any shareholder value at all after seven years.\"",

    "webTitle": "Aldi catching up with Waitrose", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The booming discount supermarket chain Aldi is on the verge of overtaking upmarket Waitrose to become the UK's sixth biggest supermarket as the German-owned grocer continues to open new stores and steal customers from its bigger rivals. New industry data released on Tuesday shows that while Tesco and Morrisons continue to decline, Aldi's share of grocery till receipts rose to 4.8% in the 12 weeks to 20 July. A year ago the discounter's market share was 3.7%, according to figures from retail analysts Kantar Worldpanel. In that period it increased sales by 4.8% to \u00a31.2bn. Over the same period Waitrose's market share edged up to 4.9% from 4.8% last year. Tesco \u2013 which announced last week that its chief executive, Philip Clarke, was stepping down \u2013 dropped to 28.9% from 30.3%. At its peak Tesco accounted for almost 32% of the annual \u00a3175bn grocery market The data confirms the trend of shoppers abandoning mid-market players in favour of more upmarket rivals and the discounters, with increasing numbers of shoppers cherry-picking from both ends of the market. Lidl, the other main discounter to enter the UK market, is also growing fast. Its market share rose to 3.6% from 3.1% as sales grew by 19.5% to \u00a3916m. Edward Garner, director at Kantar, said: \"[Aldi's market share] is a new record for the retailer. Similarly, Lidl sales have grown by nearly 20% and it has held on to its record share of 3.6%. Waitrose has continued to resist pressure from the competition, testament to its policy of maximum differentiation, and has grown sales by 3.4%. This figure is well above the market average and thereby has lifted its market share.\" It was not all gloom in the mid-market, with Asda and Sainsbury's holding their market shares at 17% and 16.6% respectively as they each improved their takings. Sales at Tesco and Morrisons both dropped by 3.8% compared with the same 12-week period last year. Kantar also supplies a snapshot of the latest four weeks of sales to 20 July, which is even more closely watched by the stock exchange. On the most recent measure, Tesco's sales surprised the City, dropping by 4.8%. One supermarket analyst, who declined to be named, said: \"We suspected it would be bad as Philip Clarke disappeared last week. But this is slightly worse than we thought.\" There was further concerning news for Tesco on the four-week numbers contained in a report by analysts at Barclays. It showed Tesco is losing sales at a consistent rate on all three of the industry's main measures: \"till roll\", which is total money taken; total grocery, which excludes non-food items such as kettles and microwaves; and food and drink, which goes further by stripping out alcohol and health and beauty products. This is supermarket purists' most keenly watched figure. Grocers sometimes can achieve better till roll figures by offering large discounts on items such as alcohol, but Barclays said Tesco's food and drink sales were the worst performing of the three measures. It added: \"The fact that Tesco has a fairly similar picture on all three measures suggests that its performance has not been distorted by aggressive promotions.\" The bank further estimated that the Kantar data suggested Tesco's same store sales would fall 6% when it announces it second-quarter numbers to the City, while Morrisons will report a drop of as much as 7% and Sainsbury's a decline of up to 1%. The disappointing numbers come against a backdrop of a challenging market. Kantar says grocery price inflation has fallen for the tenth successive period and now stands at just 0.4% \u2013 its lowest level since the research firm started measuring prices in 2006. As a result, market growth has fallen to 0.9% \u2013 the lowest figure for 10 years. Tim Vallance, head of retail at property group JLL, said: \"The figures highlight the impact that the big four's response to the rise of the discount retailers is having on the grocery sector, with vicious price cutting leading to shrinking market growth. \"As shoppers continue to demand a more convenient offer in an increasingly digital world, supermarkets need to think harder about how and where their customers shop and need to focus on choice, provenance, quality, service and convenience through multiple channels to differentiate from the discounter offering.\"",

      "body": "<p>The booming discount supermarket chain Aldi is on the verge of overtaking upmarket Waitrose to become the UK's sixth biggest supermarket as the German-owned grocer continues to open new stores and steal customers from its bigger rivals.</p> <p>New industry data released on Tuesday shows that while Tesco and Morrisons continue to decline, Aldi's share of grocery till receipts rose to 4.8% in the 12 weeks to 20 July. A year ago the discounter's market share was 3.7%, according to figures from retail analysts Kantar Worldpanel. In that period it increased sales by 4.8% to \u00a31.2bn.</p> <p>Over the same period Waitrose's market share edged up to 4.9% from 4.8% last year. Tesco \u2013 which announced last week&#xa0;that its chief executive, Philip Clarke, was stepping down \u2013 dropped to 28.9% from 30.3%. At its peak Tesco accounted for almost 32% of the annual \u00a3175bn grocery market</p> <p>The data confirms the trend of shoppers abandoning mid-market players in favour of more upmarket rivals and the discounters, with increasing numbers of shoppers cherry-picking from both ends of the market. Lidl, the other main discounter to enter the UK market, is also growing fast. Its market share rose to 3.6% from 3.1% as sales grew by 19.5% to \u00a3916m.</p> <p>Edward Garner, director at Kantar, said: \"[Aldi's market share] is a new record for the retailer. Similarly, Lidl sales have grown by nearly 20% and it has held on to its record share of 3.6%. Waitrose has continued to resist pressure from the competition, testament to its policy of maximum differentiation, and has grown sales by 3.4%. This figure is well above the market average and thereby has lifted its market share.\"</p> <p>It was not all gloom in the mid-market, with Asda and Sainsbury's holding their market shares at 17% and 16.6% respectively as they each improved their takings. Sales at Tesco and Morrisons both dropped by 3.8% compared with the same 12-week period last year.</p> <p>Kantar also supplies a snapshot of the latest four weeks of sales to 20 July, which is even more closely watched by the stock exchange. On the most recent measure, Tesco's sales surprised the City, dropping by 4.8%. One supermarket analyst, who declined to be named, said: \"We suspected it would be bad as Philip Clarke disappeared last week. But this is slightly worse than we thought.\"</p> <p>There was further concerning news for Tesco on the four-week numbers contained in a report by analysts at Barclays. It showed Tesco is losing sales at a consistent rate on all three of the industry's main measures: \"till roll\", which is total money taken; total grocery, which excludes non-food items such as kettles and microwaves; and food and drink, which goes further by stripping out alcohol and health and beauty products. This is supermarket purists' most keenly watched figure.</p> <p>Grocers sometimes can achieve better till roll figures by offering large discounts on items such as alcohol, but Barclays said Tesco's food and drink sales were the worst performing of the three measures. It added: \"The fact that Tesco has a fairly similar picture on all three measures suggests that its performance has not been distorted by aggressive promotions.\"</p> <p>The bank further estimated that the Kantar data suggested Tesco's same store sales would fall 6% when it announces it second-quarter numbers to the City, while Morrisons will report a drop of as much as 7% and Sainsbury's a decline of up to 1%.</p> <p>The disappointing numbers come against a backdrop of a challenging market. Kantar says grocery price inflation has fallen for the tenth successive period and now stands at just 0.4% \u2013 its lowest level since the research firm started measuring prices in 2006. As a result, market growth has fallen to 0.9% \u2013 the lowest figure for 10 years.</p> <p>Tim Vallance, head of retail at property group JLL, said: \"The figures highlight the impact that the big four's response to the rise of the discount retailers is having on the grocery sector, with vicious price cutting leading to shrinking market growth.</p> <p>\"As shoppers continue to demand a more convenient offer in an increasingly digital world, supermarkets need to think harder about how and where their customers shop and need to focus on choice, provenance, quality, service and convenience through multiple channels to differentiate from the discounter offering.\"</p>",

The Dutch foreign minister, Frans Timmermans, said on Tuesday that sanctions under consideration on Russian capital markets would have a \u201cfar-reaching and immediate effect\u201d.</p> <p>Calls for widened sanctions have gained momentum since the shooting down of Malaysia Airlines flight MH17 over eastern Ukraine, which the US and allies have said was was almost certainly shot down by pro-Russian separatists using a Russian-supplied surface-to-air missile. Russia has denied supplying such a missile.</p> <p>The US secretary of state, John Kerry, said on Tuesday there\u2019s been \u201cno shred of evidence\u201d that Russia is willing to help end the violence and bloodshed between the Ukraine separatists backed by Moscow and the government in Kiev and reiterated further US sanctions could come.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-53d7c505e4b0562e873aa0c0\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2014-07-29T16:00:31.702Z\">5.00pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong><strong><strong><strong>In a timely <a href=\"http://www.imf.org/external/pp/longres.aspx?id=4881\">report</a> given the latest EU sanctions on Russia, the IMF says the growing tensions over Ukraine could undermine financial markets in Europe and beyond.</strong></strong></strong></strong> It also warns of the effect of rising interest rates. My colleague Katie Allen writes:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Rising interest rates in advanced economies and a slowdown in emerging markets could combine to cut global growth by as much as 2%, the International Monetary Fund has warned.</p> <p>Its latest report into how policy moves in one country can spill over into others also highlights the threat that tensions in Russia and Ukraine could send shockwaves through financial and commodity markets across Europe, central Asia and beyond.</p> <p>The IMF\u2019s main concerns, however, centre around two key factors emerging as the global economy \u201cshifts from crisis to recovery mode\u201d. </p> <p>It highlights the challenge for central banks of smoothly unwinding the ultraloose monetary policy they brought in to support advanced economies during the financial crisis. Secondly, it warns that emerging market economies are slowing in a \u201csynchronised and protracted manner\u201d and that poses risks to the rest of the world in terms of trade and finance.</p> <p>The report is the latest to emphasise the complex task of returning to more normal interest rates after years of extraordinary measures to shore up markets and confidence. In the UK, base rates have been at a record low of 0.5% for more than five years while in both the US and UK there have been vast money printing schemes, known as quantitative easing.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2014-07-29T16:58:06.104Z\">at 5.58pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-53d7bf54e4b057738f617bbd\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2014-07-29T15:39:44.062Z\">4.39pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>A full statement on EU sanctions against Russia is expected tomorrow, although some further details are expected to emerge before then.</p> <p>But some seem to feel they don't go far enough:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/BCAppelbaum/statuses/494139188661747712\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>If the EU really wanted to punish Russia, they would make it join the Eurozone.</p>&mdash; Binyamin Appelbaum (@BCAppelbaum) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BCAppelbaum/statuses/494139188661747712\">July 29, 2014</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-53d7bb7be4b057738f617bb8\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2014-07-29T15:26:31.386Z\">4.26pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>More snippets on the sanctions:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/businessinsider/statuses/494139326746607616\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>Diplomats: EU governments are going after Russian banks over Ukraine <a href=\"http://t.co/JDk8X7eyLD\">http://t.co/JDk8X7eyLD</a></p>&mdash; Business Insider (@businessinsider) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/businessinsider/statuses/494139326746607616\">July 29, 2014</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/ManfredWeber/statuses/494138832317849600\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>New sanctions on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Russia?src=hash\">#Russia</a>: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/EPPGroup\">@EPPGroup</a> backs <a href=\"https://twitter.com/EUCouncil\">@EUCouncil</a>.

It comes ahead of a raft of US economic data this week, including GDP and non-farm payrolls and - crucially - the result of the latest Federal Reserve meeting tomorrow. The Fed is expected to trim its bond buying programme by $10m a month once more, but strong data puts more pressure on the central bank to think about raising interest rates. James Knightley at ING Bank said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>June\u2019s figure was also revised higher so we now have a really strong upward trend in place. Importantly, the bulk of the improvement was in the expectations component. The 92.7 reading for this component has historically been consistent with real consumer spending growth of close to 3% year on year versus the current rate of 1.9%, thereby offering hope that the US growth story can gain more momentum in the second half of 2014.</p> <p>In any case, we expect tomorrow\u2019s second quarter GDP number to come in on the strong side of market expectations and look for Friday\u2019s payrolls number to be firm too (with the possibility of a sub-6% unemployment rate figure). Such an outcome would put pressure on the Federal Reserve to shift the balance of their language while bringing forward market expectations for the First Fed rate hike \u2013 we are predicting April.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/ReutersJamie/statuses/494128521993011200\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>US consumer confidence surges to highest since Oct 2007.

      "bodyText": "Of course, the EU sanctions on Russia is not the end of it: On that note, it\u2019s time to shut up for the evening. Thanks for all your comments and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. European markets came off their best levels as news that the European Union had agreed sanctions against Russia over Ukraine began to filter through. But they still managed to end the day in poslitive territory, with some good corporate results from the likes of GKN in the UK and Pfizer in the US helping sentiment. The closing scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished 19.68 points or 0.29% higher at 6807.75 Germany\u2019s Dax rose 0.58% at 9653.63 France\u2019s Cac closed 0.48% better at 4365.58 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB added 0.7% to 21085.12 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended 0.2% higher at 10901.2 In the US, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is uncertain which way to turn, alternating between positive and negative territory. At the moment it is up 23 points or 0.14%. Here\u2019s a flavour of our story on the EU sanctions on Russia: European Union governments reached a deal on Tuesday to impose economic sanctions against Russia, targeting its oil industry, defence, dual-use goods and sensitive technologies. The sanctions will be reviewed after three months, a diplomat said. Details of the EU sanctions are still to come but could also include a ban on the country\u2019s biggest state-owned banks from selling stock or long-term debt on European markets. The Dutch foreign minister, Frans Timmermans, said on Tuesday that sanctions under consideration on Russian capital markets would have a \u201cfar-reaching and immediate effect\u201d. Calls for widened sanctions have gained momentum since the shooting down of Malaysia Airlines flight MH17 over eastern Ukraine, which the US and allies have said was was almost certainly shot down by pro-Russian separatists using a Russian-supplied surface-to-air missile. Russia has denied supplying such a missile. The US secretary of state, John Kerry, said on Tuesday there\u2019s been \u201cno shred of evidence\u201d that Russia is willing to help end the violence and bloodshed between the Ukraine separatists backed by Moscow and the government in Kiev and reiterated further US sanctions could come. In a timely report given the latest EU sanctions on Russia, the IMF says the growing tensions over Ukraine could undermine financial markets in Europe and beyond. It also warns of the effect of rising interest rates. My colleague Katie Allen writes: Rising interest rates in advanced economies and a slowdown in emerging markets could combine to cut global growth by as much as 2%, the International Monetary Fund has warned. Its latest report into how policy moves in one country can spill over into others also highlights the threat that tensions in Russia and Ukraine could send shockwaves through financial and commodity markets across Europe, central Asia and beyond. The IMF\u2019s main concerns, however, centre around two key factors emerging as the global economy \u201cshifts from crisis to recovery mode\u201d. It highlights the challenge for central banks of smoothly unwinding the ultraloose monetary policy they brought in to support advanced economies during the financial crisis. Secondly, it warns that emerging market economies are slowing in a \u201csynchronised and protracted manner\u201d and that poses risks to the rest of the world in terms of trade and finance. The report is the latest to emphasise the complex task of returning to more normal interest rates after years of extraordinary measures to shore up markets and confidence. In the UK, base rates have been at a record low of 0.5% for more than five years while in both the US and UK there have been vast money printing schemes, known as quantitative easing. A full statement on EU sanctions against Russia is expected tomorrow, although some further details are expected to emerge before then. But some seem to feel they don't go far enough: More snippets on the sanctions: Breaking news on Russian sanctions which have just been agreed by the European Union: Dual use goods, by the way, according to the European Commission are \"goods, software and technology normally used for civilian purposes but which may have military applications,.\" The positive US confidence data - along with positive results from Pfizer and Merck - has helped the Dow Jones Industrial Average climb 66 points or 0.39%. In contrast to the weaker than expected US housing figures earlier and despite the growing geopolitical tensions, the country's consumers appear in confident mood. According to the Conference Board index, an industry group, consumer confidence jumped to 90.9 in July, up from a revised 86.4 the previous month and better than the 85.3 expected. This is the highest monthly level since October 2007, before the financial crisis struck. It comes ahead of a raft of US economic data this week, including GDP and non-farm payrolls and - crucially - the result of the latest Federal Reserve meeting tomorrow. The Fed is expected to trim its bond buying programme by $10m a month once more, but strong data puts more pressure on the central bank to think about raising interest rates. James Knightley at ING Bank said: June\u2019s figure was also revised higher so we now have a really strong upward trend in place. Importantly, the bulk of the improvement was in the expectations component. The 92.7 reading for this component has historically been consistent with real consumer spending growth of close to 3% year on year versus the current rate of 1.9%, thereby offering hope that the US growth story can gain more momentum in the second half of 2014. In any case, we expect tomorrow\u2019s second quarter GDP number to come in on the strong side of market expectations and look for Friday\u2019s payrolls number to be firm too (with the possibility of a sub-6% unemployment rate figure). Such an outcome would put pressure on the Federal Reserve to shift the balance of their language while bringing forward market expectations for the First Fed rate hike \u2013 we are predicting April. Britain saw record strong demand for a sale of long-term, inflation-linked, government debt today. The Debt Management Office (which handles UK sovereign bond sales) auctioned off \u00a35bn of a new index-linked bond that matures in 44 years time, in 2058. And \u00a314bn of orders flooded in \u2013 a record, according to Jo Whelan, the DMO's deputy CEO. This strong demand meant the DMO was able to price the bond at a 'negative real yield', or interest rate after inflation, of minus 0.053%. That means buyers will receive a return of just below the UK inflation rate, another record. Whelan said: With this very strong support from the market we are pleased to have been able to launch the new gilt in substantial size and at a negative real yield for the first time in a DMO index-linked gilt syndication. It's a sign that British debt remains popular in the markets, especially with investors such as pension funds who need to hold long-term assets to balance their long-term liabilities. Jamie Searle, a UK rates strategist at Citigroup, told Bloomberg that the auction attracted more interest than expected. \u201cThat together with the size of the order book and the speed with which it was built suggest that demand was strong. The trend of pension fund de-risking remains firmly in place and a 2058 maturity is likely to appeal to liability-driven investment accounts in particular.\u201d Sam Hill of RBC Capital Markets agreed: A large part of the demand comes from return-insensitive pension funds. They remain fairly skewed towards minimising risks and inflation is a big part of that. (quote via fastFT) Most of the orders came from British institutions, according to the DMO. It has now raised its target for ultra-long index-linked bond sales this year to \u00a39bn, from \u00a38.5bn. The auction came as other safe-haven European bonds saw strong demand. German borrowing costs hit new record lows today, with the yield (or interest rate) on 10-year Bunds dropping to 1.12%, from 1.14% yesterday, in the bond market. That is lower than during the eurozone crisis. Traders said Bunds prices (which move inversely to yields) were being pushed up by fears of slow growth and deflation in Europe, and the possibility that the ECB will launch a quantitative easing programme. (and with that, I'm handing over to Nick Fletcher. Cheers, GW) Bloomberg's reporting that hundreds of IT jobs worker at JP Morgan are being 'let go': The US housing market appears to have lost some oomph, which came as something of a surprise to Wall Street analysts. The S&amp;P/Case-Shiller Home Price Index survey showed that prices rose by 9.4% annually in May, compared to 10.8% in the year to April. Prices rose 1.1% month-on-month, but actually fell by 0.3% in inflation-adjusted terms. David Blitzer, of S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices, said the US housing sector has been \"turning in mixed economic numbers\" in recent months: \"Prices and sales of existing homes have shown improvement while construction and sales of new homes continue to lag.\" Christine Lagarde has urged Ukraine to push on with the measures agreed with the International Monetary Fund, as part of its support programme. The IMF chief held meetings in Ukraine today, with central bank governor Valerya Gontareva and foreign minister Pavlo Klimkin. An IMF spokesperson explains: The discussion focused on the recent political developments in Ukraine and the authorities\u2019 efforts to implement the economic reform program supported by a Stand-By Arrangement with the Fund. The Managing Director encouraged steady implementation of the authorities\u2019 reforms, including the policy package needed for completion of the first review under the program supported by the IMF.\u201d The IMF has approved a $17bn bailout for Ukraine, but there are concerns that more will be needed, given its economic deterioration since the crisis with Russia began. The shareholder criticism is over, and now it's time for the votes. And Vodafone's key resolutions on its pay policies and long-term incentive plans have all been approved with high majorities. Vodafone is now being challenged over its role in allowing governments to snoop on its citizens. Peter Micek of Access, an organisation that defends digital rights, urged Vodafone to support its work fighting surveillance and changing laws that allow governments to access our communications. He also asked them how they will stop 'warrantless snooping' Important questions. In reply, Vodafone chairman Gerard Kleisterlee said the company was in active discussions with the UK government over its proposed changes to the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act (RIPA). Kleisterlee also insisted that Vodafone takes its customers' privacy seriously, and wants to protect it. Experts are already worried, though, that the changes being made to RIPA are being rushed through parliament too quickly. More details here. More applause at Vodafone, after a shareholder demands that Luc Vandevelde should be ejected from the firm's remuneration committee (as explained earlier, he's been helping to set pay rates for a decade). Vodafone's chief executive, Vittorio Colao, has been told that his bonus is unacceptable: Vodafone shareholders are now venting their unhappiness over the sale of its stake in Verizon back in March. Although shareholders received a slug of cash when Vodafone finally sold out to Verizon for $130bn, they also saw their total Vodafone shareholding fall (down to 6 shares for every 11 they owned before). And they're now feeling poorer*. * - Technically they are no better or worse off, as Vodafone simply swapped its stake in Verizon for cash. Let's see what happens when Vodafone announces its dividend for 2015.... Vodafone was also blasted for allowing Luc Vandevelde, the former chairman of M&amp;S, to remain on its remuneration committee for more than a decade. Apparently Vandevelde should stay because he's doing a \"great\" job. Shareholders find that quite amusing. For whom is he doing a great job?.... Back at the Vodafone AGM, and shareholders are applauding after an investor challenged the board over their pay packets. Can they really be justified, given Vodafone's mixed performance, and its disappointing results last week, asks a representative of a London local authority pension fund. Apparently some of Vodafone's lucrative incentive deals will yield a little less money in future, the chairman replied: The imminent prospect of tougher sanctions being imposed on Russia have driven the ruble down to a two-month low. One US dollar now buys 35.7 rubles, the most since early May, as the selloff which began yesterday continues. Russia also announced that it has cancelled a government bond auction today -- this is a fairly regular occurrence, though. World leader are expected to announce new sanctions later today. And Malcom Rifkind, a former UK foreign secretary, has urged them to take a tough line with Moscow. He told the Radio 4's Today Programme that the measures announced thus far have been \"pretty useless\": \"If you impose visa controls or asset freezes on 50 or 60 of his cronies, well, I'm sure they're very disappointed [but] why should Putin change his foreign policy? \"When you get into the situation of preventing them having access to financial markets, preventing high-quality exports for their energy industry, that goes to the very heart of the Russian economy. \"So this is not about popularity, it's about economic damage because if Putin wants to have \u2013 as he does want to have \u2013 strong armed forces, a proactive foreign policy, that is expensive and the Russian economy is already in a pretty sorry state.\" There don't appear to be any protests outside the Vodafone AGM, but tax campaigners has been chivying the mobile giant online. Vodafone is trying to pacify its shareholders by reminding them how much money they've had back. We've returned \u00a3123bn to investors in last 10 years, it says, and over \u00a380bn in last 4 years. Recent share price performace isn't as rosy, though -- down 16% during 2014 (although this is complicated by the sale of its Verizon stake) ShareAction, the campaign group, are also attending the Vodafone AGM - they reckon there's some grumbling in the ranks: Vodafone's chairman has called on Europe to stop driving down mobile phone costs, at the start of its annual shareholder meeting in London. My colleague Juliette Garside is there, and reports that Gerard Kleisterlee argued that Brussels is threatening long-term investment. We can't expect Vodafone to enjoy regulators pushing down its profits, of course \u2013 but most consumer groups have welcomed cuts to roaming charges and overseas bills. In the world of football, chairmen usually hand out the votes of confidence. But in the City, they can receive them too. Sir Ken Morrison, the grand old man of UK retail, has just declared that he \"welcomes\" the appointment of Andrew Higginson as chairman elect of W Morrisons this morning. He's got good background, good experience... Higginson has been lured from Poundland by the challenge of helping to revitalise the chain that Sir Ken built. A former Tesco finance director, he left after missing out on the top job there (bet he's got over that disappointment, given Phil Clarke's troubles!) Morrison's needs his help, too. The latest figures from Kantor show that its sales have slumped by 3.8% in the last 12 weeks. Mind you, so have Tesco, as the discount chains gain ground (more on this shortly...) After a positive start, BP shares have now fallen 0.8% or 4p to 492p. The prospect of fresh Russian sanctions may be having an effect. We shouldn't be surprised that BP is worried about Russian sanctions; its alliance with Rosneft has yielded tasty earnings since it was established in 2012. My colleague Jennifer Rankin reports: BP has earned bumper profits from its stake in the Kremlin-controlled oil company Rosneft since the start of the year, but warned investors that it could be hurt by western sanctions against Russia. The FTSE 100 company, which owns one fifth of Russia's largest oil company, made $1.6bn (\u00a3950m) from Rosneft in the first six months of 2014, an 80% increase on last year. On top of this BP was paid a $700m dividend from Rosneft in July. But with the European Union poised to announce tougher sanctions against Russia, BP acknowledged that its reputation was at stake over its ties with the Russian state oil giant. \"Further economic sanctions could adversely impact our business and strategic objectives in Russia, the level of our income, production and reserves, our investment in Rosneft and our reputation,\" the company said. Here's her full story: BP warns on Russia sanctions despite Rosneft profits Analysts at S&amp;P Capital like the look of Next's results this morning - they've raised their price target on its shares to \u00a371.00, from \u00a367.00. They're currently changing hands for \u00a366.90, a gain of 2.6% today. Expectations that the UK housing market would slow this summer have taken a knock. Mortgage approvals actually rose in June, for the first time in four months, with 67,196 loans being granted. That suggests that the new affordability tests which were imposed this spring only had a temporary impact on the sector. Rob Wood of Berenberg Bank says housing activity is rising again: As the temporary disruption from tighter regulations passes we expect approvals to return to their upward trend. With interest rates very low and house building way behind the demand for new homes we look for house prices to gain 10% in 2014 and 2015. And the rest of the country could outpace London.... There may be further residual effects from the new rules, particularly in London. While, in our view, the new regulations are a temporary disruption, they could have more long-lasting effects in London where affordability is most stretched. Ben Broadbent, deputy governor of the Bank of England, has argued today that Britain's swelling current account deficit isn't an \"existential threat\" to Britain's stability. In a speech in London, Broadbent argued that the UK's \"hard-won policy framework\" means its economic credibility isn't under threat. He acknowledged that gap between trade, asset income and transfers into Britain, and out of the country is at the widest for decades. That's partly because the UK's is struggling to close the trade gap: It exists partly because the rest of the UK-trade-weighted world, the rest of Europe in particular, hasn\u2019t yet recovered as rapidly. If the global economy remains sluggish, it will inevitably be harder for an open economy like the UK to achieve both strong and balanced growth. But, interestingly, the recent deterioration also due to a drop in the income received on the UK\u2019s overseas balance sheet, compared to what foreign investors are getting on their UK assets below. It's not just because of the trade gap. The full speech is here - here are some more charts. One of the most recognisable features of the London skyline is up for sale. The Gherkin skyscraper went on the market this morning, after collapsing into receivership in April. The Lord Foster-designed tower could raise \u00a3640m, with sellers hoping for interest from around the world. More here: London's Gherkin skyscraper put on the market Barclays isn't the only bank facing question over its Dark Pool \u2013 financial regulators are taking a closer look at other investment banks' anonymous trading systems too. As fastFT flagged up this morning, Swiss bank UBS has alerted its shareholders that its Dark Pool is being probed: It said: UBS is responding to inquiries concerning the operation of UBS's alternative trading system (ATS) (also referred to as a dark pool) and its securities order routing and execution practices from various authorities, including the SEC, the New York Attorney General and FINRA, who reportedly are pursuing similar investigations industry-wide. These inquiries include an SEC investigation that began in early 2012 concerning features of UBS's ATS, including certain order types and disclosure practices that were discontinued two years ago. UBS is cooperating in these matters. A new front has opened up over Barclay's controversial Dark Pool trading system. A US investor has filed a lawsuit claiming she suffered losses when US authorities launched legal action against Barclays last month. Reuters explains: Barbara Strougo of New York filed a class action lawsuit in New York on Monday against Barclays and its Chief Executive Antony Jenkins and Finance Director Tushar Morzaria. It also names former CEO Bob Diamond and former finance chief Chris Lucas as defendants. Strougo claimed she and other buyers of Barclays American depositary shares (ADS) lost money after the attorney general brought a lawsuit against Barclays' \"dark pool\" trading venue on June 25. Barclays' London-listed shares fell more than 5 percent the next day, and the ADS fell 7.4 percent. Last week, Barclays hit back, claiming the attorney general's claim was without merit. It's shares didn't really react, though - much to the disappointment of Ms Strougo and co, I suspect. The diplomatic wheels are turning. Germany's foreign minister tweets that five of the most powerful world leaders agreed (last night) that tougher sanctions should be imposed on Russia. Back to BP, which issued that warning about Russian sanctions this morning. Financial analyst Jasper Lawler of CMC Markets has published a note explaining why the oil firm is so exposed to Russia. Lawler writes: While a lot of its peers do have minority interests in Russia through oil prices and strategic partnerships with Russian oil companies, BP\u2019s exposure makes it much more susceptible to political headwinds by way of its associations with Rosneft [with a 19.75% stake]. BP's shares have \"hugely underperformed\" recently, due to Vladimir Putin's actions towards Ukraine, he explains: BP had actually been the outperformer amongst the oil majors but when Russian troops moved in to occupy Crimea in February the stock\u2019s relative outperformance peaked and never recovered. Since the US government\u2019s sectoral sanctions against Russia including the energy sector in late June; BP\u2019s underperformance has accelerated, rising only 2% and hugely underperforming major oil rivals Royal Dutch Shell, Exxon Mobil and Chevron, all up over 9% in the same period. The EU and US could announce new sanctions against Russia as early as today. Already, Rosneft has been hit by American sanctions which bar it from long-term borrowing from US banks. That's likely to hit its earnings - it currently provides around 10% of BP's profits. Lawler adds: A rise in oil prices or at least a stabilisation of recent declines should benefit BP\u2019s share price but while Russia is being sanctioned by the US and Europe and BP maintains its 20% stake in Rosneft, the current trend in prices suggest BP risks continuing to underperform. Hat-tip to Andrew Clark of The Times. He points out that US pharmaceuticals giant Pfizer must reveal how much it spent on its failed takeover bid for Britain's AstraZeneca, when it publishes its results later today. The football World Cup has helped to drive sales up at Domino's Pizza. Sales are up by an impressive 11.5% in the first half of this year, due to better marketing and bundled offers, as well as demand from football fans. In the UK, it's recorded double digit like-for-like sales growth for the last nine months. But, rather like poor old Brazil, Domino's is struggling to tackle Germany, where sales are down 1.7% this year. Reuters explains: In Germany, where Britain's biggest pizza delivery firm's much-anticipated expansion plans have been hampered by restructuring costs and weak trading, the firm said conditions continued to prove challenging. The firm has slowed German expansion while it gets to grips with store formats,overheads and growing sales and said it had yet to transfer all of its poorly-trading own-managed stores there to franchisees - a move Domino's hopes will boost sales. BP's shares have inched up by 0.6% in early trading. Shares in Next have jumped 2% at the start of trading in London, as the City welcomes its upgraded profit forecasts. Oil giant BP has warned the City this morning that it could suffer if fresh sanctions are imposed on Russia. In its latest results, BP cautioned that it would suffer an \"\"adverse impact\" if Western powers hit Moscow with fresh economic restrictions -- in response to the crisis in Ukraine. BP is closely involved with Russia, and owns almost 20% of Rosneft, one of the country's biggest oil producer. That relationship looks more fragile in the light of recent events. As BP spells out in its results today: Any future erosion of our relationship with Rosneft, or the impact of further economic sanctions, could adversely impact our business and strategic objectives in Russia, the level of our income, production and reserves, our investment in Rosneft and our reputation. That warning takes the shine of decent-looking performance from BP. It has reported a 34% surge in second-quarter profits, from $2.7bn to $3.6bn. Chief executive Bob Dudley (who was famously thrown out of Russia in 2008), declared: \u201cThis was another successful quarter, delivering both operational progress and robust cash flow. Britain's consumer recovery has boosted sales and earnings at high street and shopping directory chain Next. The company hiked its profit forecasts by a chunky \u00a325m this morning, in the latest sign that shoppers are continuing to spend. Next hammered home its dominance over high street rival Marks &amp; Spencer, reporting high street sales are up 7.5% this year, with directory sales (including online) surging 16.2% The company gave some of the credit to this year's decent weather (last year's chills did not encourage customers to splash out on new outfits). But still, it's a strong performance - also showing that Britain's economic recovery has been pushed along by consumers. Next does caution, though, that growth will slow in the months ahead: ...our guidance for the next six months is for growth of between 4% and 10%. And here's the details: Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the financial markets, the world economy, business and finance. Busy day of corporate news ahead, with a clutch of major European companies reporting results this morning. That includes UK retailer Next, which is benefitting from the UK recovery, and oil giant BP, in the spotlight over its links to Russia. Domino's Pizza is also reporting its results today. Later we get US drugs firm's Pfizer's results - will it talk about its failed bid for UK pharmaceuticals firm AstraZeneca? Two major European banks are also reporting today. UBS has posted a 15% jump in net profits driven by lower costs, but Deutsche Bank's next profits are down by 29%, due to a fall in revenue. There could be drama at mobile phone giant Vodafone's AGM (11am today; expect tough questions over boardroom pay, and surveillance -- after it admitted that governments can listen to all conversation on its network. And Bank of England deputy governor Ben Broadbent is giving a speech in London this morning (from 8am). We'll also be watching Greece. Yesterday, the Athens government named a new chief for its privatisation agency - the fifth in four years, in a bid to keep its bailout programme on track.",

M&amp;S remains Britain's biggest clothing retailer by total sales, but those have been falling for 12 quarters in a row as the retailer struggles to shed its frumpy reputation and attract younger shoppers. Next's sales are ahead of the 5.5%-9.5% full-year growth guidance given in April, prompting the company to raise this to 7%-10%. Wolfson said he remains concerned about the impact of higher interest rates and rampant house prices in south-east England. \"There's no doubt that if the economy continues to perform well at some point interest rates will go up and at that point we will need to be cautious about our budgeting,\" he said, adding that Next's core customers are particularly vulnerable to an increase in rates, which could come at the turn of the year. Next recently lost product director Christos Angelides to US fashion chain Abercrombie &amp; Fitch and its finance director David Keens, who decided to retire after 23 years in the post. Angelides' responsibilities are expected to be split between different people Keens will be replaced by Amanda James, currently brand finance director, from next March. Fredddie George, retail analyst at Cantor Fitzgerald, said: \"The company has significantly outperformed the market in a more difficult quarter than the first quarter. It has, as yet, not seen any negative impact from the resignation of Christos Angelides.\" He added: \"The directory will continue to benefit from growth in the online market, an increase in customer numbers, a broadening of the ranges and the opportunity to develop overseas.\" Next delighted shareholders by paying a third special dividend of 50p a share this week, repeating payouts in February and May.",

      "bodyText": "The recent slowdown in the UK housing market might prove to be short-lived, as figures showed the number of mortgage approvals rose for the first time in five months in June. Approvals increased more than expected to 67,196, up from 62,007 in May, according to the Bank of England. The City had forecast a smaller increase to 62,600. Economists said the figures suggested lenders were getting to grips with the new rules that came into effect under the mortgage market review (MMR) in April. The tougher rules require lenders to take additional steps to ensure people will be able to afford their mortgage repayments in the future. Matthew Pointon, a property economist at Capital Economics, said the latest figures probably marked the beginning of a steady rise in mortgage lending over the coming months. \"The disruption caused by the MMR appears to be passing, with the Bank of England reporting a healthy rise in mortgage approvals in June. A strong economic recovery will ensure that lending grows steadily over the coming months. \"On balance, mortgage lending is likely to rise at a slow but steady pace over the rest of the year. In turn, that is consistent with further gains in house prices, although at a slower pace than that seen over the past 12 months.\" The Council of Mortgage Lenders also forecast a stronger picture for the mortgage market in 2014 and 2015. It revised up its estimate for gross lending in 2014 by \u00a313bn to \u00a3208bn amid a stronger economic backdrop. That would represent an increase of 18% compared with 2013, and the first time that lending exceeded \u00a3200bn since 2008. The CML also raised its forecast for gross mortgage lending in 2015 by \u00a314bn to \u00a3220bn. It said: \"There is a degree of uncertainty as to the possible impact of rate increases, given that households have not experienced such an event for seven years and that the backdrop is one where there has been a protracted fall in real incomes and uncertainty about future income growth. \"Given a favourable jobs market, it seems reasonable to think that the majority of households will cope well with initial gentle rate rises. Where households are financially stretched and do not have coping strategies, arrears will build, although this should be relatively slowly over time.\"",

And that was just Cubs, for crying out loud. I had pretty much zero financial stake in my performance there, whereas asking bankers to be ethical might cost them hundreds of thousands of pounds. No, an oath for bankers is a nice idea on paper, but I can solemnly swear I'll eat my own legs if it works.</p>",

Argentina's options are essentially: \u2022 Repay the holdouts in full \u2013 but this seems unlikely given the government says it cannot afford to do that and pay the money due to the exchange bondholders who took a haircut \u2022 Attempt to renegotiate terms with the holdouts \u2022 Default on everything \u2013 that would be a major setback for an economy trying to regain access to international markets.

The 40-storey City of London skyscraper was put into receivership in April, and the agents appointed to sell it are hoping for offers in the region of \u00a3600m to \u00a3650m. Savills and Deloitte Real Estate have been jointly instructed to sell the 505,000 sq ft (46,900 sq m) office building, which was designed by Lord Foster and opened in 2004. The two firms said marketing of the Gherkin \u2013 including an advertising campaign and a dedicated website \u2013 was about to begin, \"with interest expected to come from all corners of the globe\". Built at St Mary Axe on the site of the Baltic Exchange shipping market, which was badly damaged by an IRA bomb attack in 1992, the Gherkin quickly became a London landmark, featuring in TV programmes and films. Perhaps its most prominent role came in the 2006 erotic thriller Basic Instinct 2, in which the building doubled up as the office of a criminal psychiatrist. The building currently has about 20 tenants, including the insurer Swiss Re, which originally owned the building, and is also used as a wedding venue. Stephen Down, head of central London investment at Savills, said several parties had already registered their interest, and added that he anticipated they would be looking to close the deal by the end of September or the beginning of October. He said the building had been well looked after: \"It's in very good order.\" Potential buyers could include a sovereign wealth fund from the Middle East or Asia, or perhaps a large pension fund or private equity house. Deloitte, which was appointed to take control of the tower, previously said that the Gherkin's co-owners \u2013 a Mayfair-based investment bank and a German property investor, IVG Immobilien \u2013 had run into problems related to currency issues, rather than any difficulties with the wider property market.",
