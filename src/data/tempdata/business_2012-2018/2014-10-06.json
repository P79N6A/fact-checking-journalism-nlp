      "bodyText": "It\u2019s the mega-merger rumour that won\u2019t go away: Glencore is getting ready to make a bid for Rio Tinto. The latest airing, from Bloomberg, contained the detail that Chinalco of China, which owns almost 10% of Rio, is being sounded out to support the creation of a $160bn (\u00a3100bn) mining monster. Rio\u2019s New York-traded stock briefly rose nearly 20%. Glencore\u2019s Ivan Glasenberg, billionaire kingpin and 8% owner of the company, has an unquenchable appetite for owning and trading assets, so the heart of the tale is easy to believe. It\u2019s hard, though, to understand why Rio\u2019s shareholders would be tempted by any price that Glencore could afford to offer. Rio has had accidents aplenty in the past \u2013 from the hubristic $38bn top-of-the-market purchase of Alcan in 2007 to the comic failure to gain permits to ship coal along the Zambezi in Mozambique. But these days Rio investors know roughly what they own: a low-cost producer of iron ore in Australia with a sideline in copper in Mongolia. Iron ore prices are currently plunging but, if investors don\u2019t like Rio\u2019s reliance on serving Chinese steelmakers, other miners\u2019 shares are available. Why would they wish to swap their Rio shares for Glencore stock, except on terms that Glasenberg would never offer? Glencore, in case anybody has forgotten, has been a shocking performer as a public company. It was floated at 530p in 2011 but the shares fetch 340p today. Where is the appeal for Rio meant to lie? Tesco\u2019s new hire Richard Cousins of Compass Group, on the face of it, is a good hire for Tesco as a non-executive director. He is a successful chief executive; he has crisis-fighting experience as his first task at Compass, in 2006, was to resolve a messy scandal involving a UN contract; and Compass, as a contract caterer, could be viewed as being in the retail game, broadly speaking. But there\u2019s a problem: does Cousins have enough free hours to get his hands dirty at Tesco? One would have assumed not, because lack of time was the reason Cousins gave for quitting the Reckitt Benckiser board in May. Reckitt\u2019s statement from last December was frank on why Cousins would leave: \u201cRichard is assuming an increasingly day-to-day operational role as CEO of Compass Group, which he has concluded will impact on his ability to devote sufficient time to his role as a non-executive director of Reckitt Benckiser.\u201d No room for misunderstanding there: Cousins felt he needed to concentrate on his day job, an understandable stance as it is Compass that pays his wages. Five months after leaving Reckitt, however, Cousins suddenly has time to put in a shift at Tesco. How? Neither Tesco\u2019s nor Compass\u2019s statements explained. Compass shareholders, you would think, will want to push chairman Paul Walsh. Was Cousins using the \u201cnot enough hours in the day\u201d plea as a polite excuse to exit Reckitt? Or has his \u201cday-to-day operational role\u201d at Compass changed yet again? Reckitt was a gentle posting as the Dettol to Durex group tends to run on rails. Today\u2019s Tesco is a very different prospect. Sir Richard Broadbent, chairman, is relying on Cousins, plus Mikael Ohlsson from Ikea, to repair the board\u2019s deficit in retailing experience. Of course, even an overstretched non-executive worth his salt could have told Broadbent that running four corporate jets, then ordering a fifth, is inviting trouble. But the job is meant to be more demanding than that. If Cousins found the Reckitt post too time-consuming, what is he doing at Tesco? Bramson\u2019s mistake Edward Bramson, the activist investor, got what he deserved yesterday in an attempt to storm the boardroom of Electra Private Equity: a thumbs-down from other shareholders. Four-fifths of their votes were cast against his election. In the end, the outcome wasn\u2019t even close. Bramson\u2019s Sherborne Investors, despite owning a 20% stake, could only get to 38%. Bramson\u2019s mistake was to claim there was \u201cat least\u201d \u00a31bn of extra value to be released from Electra but fail to explain how he could, in effect, double the share price within a couple of years. \u201cHe had no insights, no thoughts, no opinions, no plans \u2013 nothing whatsoever,\u201d said the representative from Investec Asset Management at the meeting. Quite. If Bramson really thought there was a spare \u00a31bn waiting to be scooped up, he should have tried to summon a few financial backers to support a full bid. Instead, he created the impression that his efforts were an attempt to gain creeping control of Electra. This was a resounding defeat but Bramson is not the type to slink away. Perhaps he will attempt a full takeover. If not, the whole adventure looks an enormous waste of time and energy.",

      "bodyText": "Britain\u2019s \u00a33tn pensions industry should be opened up to greater scrutiny to give savers a chance to influence investment decisions, according to a group of Labour MPs. They plan to argue at the Co-operative party\u2019s annual conference in London this weekend that pension savers must be given powers to question retirement fund managers and to elect trustees to occupational schemes that operate as private funds. The new rules would allow workers to oversee insurers which run private occupational schemes and force them to match the transparency and accountability observed by trust-based schemes. Gareth Thomas, chair of the Co-operative party said: \u201cWe need to make the pensions and savings industry more accountable to those who invest their funds over the long term.\u201d He said that many employers had adopted schemes that regularly published information and allowed workers to sit on advisory boards, but pension schemes run by City firms failed to provide information or allow savers to influence investment decisions.\u201cToo many of the institutional investors who manage and control the bulk of the private pensions and savings industry do not do enough to consult, inform and listen to the priorities of their customers,\u201d he said. The demand follows a string of critical reports on the pension fund industry, including a study by the European Federation of Financial Services Users last week that revealed how savers in Belgium, Britain, France, Italy and Spain have suffered negative returns this century once inflation was taken into account. In Britain, pension schemes lost 0.7% a year between 2000 and 2012, according to the report. An earlier report sponsored by the Royal Society for the Encouragement of Arts, Manufacturers and Commerce (RSA) found that high charges and poor fund management cost UK pension investors 40% of their retirement income. The London mayor, Boris Johnson, called at the weekend for the merger of public sector pension schemes to cut costs and increase investment in infrastructure projects. He said 39,000 public sector funds should be merged to create a \u201ccitizen\u2019s wealth fund\u201d which could invest in major infrastructure to help stimulate Britain\u2019s economy. Gregg McClymont, the shadow pensions minister, has already committed Labour to requiring pension funds to disclose how they vote at company AGMs as part of a move towards collective schemes currently used in Holland and Denmark and recommended by the RSA. Thomas said rules bringing greater transparency were an easy first step to giving savers more control over their funds. \u201cMarkets work best when companies have the information they need to make informed choices. A more transparent pension fund industry will increase confidence in saving for the long term,\u201d he said. The move follows a survey of the largest occupational schemes showing transparency and member engagement was very poor. Four new rights would be created \u2013 a right to know where money is being invested, a right to question the pension and savings fund managers who make investments, a right to be consulted on how the pension or savings fund will use its power in corporate boardrooms and a right to elect representatives to the board of the pension or savings fund. Thomas pointed out that last month Legal &amp; General became the first insurance company to hold an AGM for one of its prominent schemes.",

The department store chain has already agreed deals with Sports Direct and Costa Coffee as its chief executive, Michael Sharp, tries to wean shoppers off the regular discount days that it previously relied on to boost trade. The chain has struggled to keep pace with John Lewis, Britain\u2019s biggest department store group, which has outperformed competitors thanks to its strong website, attractive stores and a more affluent customer base. Dire Christmas trading prompted a rethink at Debenhams with Sharp telling the City earlier this year that 10% of its floor space \u2013 1m sq ft \u2013 could be made more profitable by introducing new brands and services. Sports Direct departments have already opened in Debenhams stores in Harrow and Southsea and another two are set to open.

The area given over to the buggies-to-bibs retailer in Manchester is 6,000 sq ft - as big as one of its standalone stores. The tie-up with Mothercare is an interesting one as its finance director Matt Smith will take up the same post of Debenhams later this year. Mothercare is also facing its own challenges. Its new boss, Mark Newton-Jones, has launched a \u00a3100m rights issue as it looks to raise a war chest to shut underperforming stores and overhaul its outdated systems. On Thursday investors will vote on the fundraising plan with the retailer\u2019s major shareholders thought to be supportive of the move. Debenhams\u2019 dealings with Mike Ashley\u2019s Sports Direct are complicated by the sportswear tycoon\u2019s financial hold on the business. He speaks for more than 11% of the company after spending \u00a333m buying a near 5% stake last week.

      "bodyText": "Shares in Rio Tinto jumped in New York on Monday after a report that it could face a takeover bid from rival Glencore to create a \u00a3100bn mining giant. The US-listed shares of Rio initially rose nearly 20% after Bloomberg reported that Glencore had approached the largest shareholder in Rio to gauge the appetite for a deal. Tie-ups between companies in the mining sector are often the subject of speculation, and rumours about a marriage between Rio and Glencore have swirled of late. Both companies have primary listings in London; a deal between the two would make the enlarged company the biggest stock market listed mining group in the world, overtaking BHP Billiton. Glencore is said by Bloomberg to have approached Chinalco, the Chinese company which has a 10% stake in Rio, about the possibility of an offer. Bloomberg reported that no formal offer had been made. Shares in London, where Glencore and Rio have their main stock market listing, had closed for trading when the report first appeared. Rio\u2019s US shares fell after the initial euphoria to be 7% higher in afternoon trading. Neither company would comment, but analysts at Bernstein published research last month exploring the options for Glencore, a company it argued was focused on conducting more acquisitions under its ambitious boss Ivan Glasenberg. It controversially bought Xstrata last year. Bernstein analysts wrote last month: \u201cA Rio Tinto-Glencore combination would create market-leading positions in iron ore, copper, nickel, zinc and coal as well as significant optionality around a number of lesser metals and minerals. Moreover, it would create the biggest and most diversified mining company on the planet.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Tesco has bolstered its board with the appointment of the former Ikea chief and the chief executive of Compass as non-executive directors. The composition of the supermarket\u2019s board has been criticised after a series of profit warnings and last month\u2019s revelation that expected first-half profits had been overstated by \u00a3250m. The recruitment of Mikael Ohlsson, who ran Ikea until a year ago, and Richard Cousins, who has led Compass since 2006, was welcomed by analysts because the existing group of non-executive directors, which include former bankers and civil servants, has no frontline retail experience. Lewis, who spent 27 years at Unilever, the maker of Dove and Lynx, previously admitted: \u201cI have never run a shop in my life.\u201d Tesco shares closed up nearly 3% at 176.75p. They had previously fallen every day since the accounting scandal was announced. The appointments bring to 11 the number of non-executive directors, including the chairman, with just two executives, Lewis and the finance director Alan Stewart. This has led to speculation that some of the longer-serving members, such as Ken Hanna, who chairs the audit committee, will step down. The chairman, Sir Richard Broadbent, is under pressure to show he is the right person to lead the board. He poached Lewis from Unilever to overhaul the company but the accounting scandal came to light when Lewis was less than three weeks into the job. \u201cMikael and Richard have been updated on, and are wholly supportive of, the steps being taken by the new management team to rebuild trust in Tesco and to focus all the resources of the business to deliver value to our customers,\u201d he said. On Ohlsson\u2019s watch, the notoriously secretive flat-pack firm Ikea became more open and published details of its financial performance for the first time. He led the group for four years but was replaced a year ago by Peter Agnefjall, a close associate of Ikea\u2019s billionaire founder, Ingvar Kamprad. Cousins has experience of dealing with troubled companies, having cleaned up Compass after the caterer was embroiled in a UN bribery scandal. Retail analyst Richard Hyman said Tesco needed to bring in more retail experts. \u201cOne retailer on the main board is not enough when their problems are retail ones,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen it comes to non-executive directors, it\u2019s about quality and relevance not quantity.\u201d The Financial Conduct Authority, the City regulator, is investigating the profit overstatement, which was caused by the optimistic recording of revenues from suppliers. Analysts have said directors with a retail background would have been more aware of the possibility of overstating commercial revenues. Clive Black, a retail analyst at Shore Capital, said the appointments were \u201ca light beam of good news from Tesco in a sea of darkness\u201d after events that, he said, bordered on comical. \u201cBoth gentlemen are expert in their field, highly regarded by investors and bring much-needed international consumer market experience to the fold. Non-executive directors rarely put pennies into the tills but, in this instance, we welcome the joint appointments and hope that it represents the recommencement of more effective governance of Tesco.\u201d Ohlsson and Cousins will each be paid a basic fee of \u00a370,000. The latter\u2019s decision to join the embattled grocer is a surprise as he relinquished his non-executive role at Reckitt Benckiser in May, stating that he did not have enough time for the extra duties.",

      "bodyText": "The rally which began on Friday after better than expected US non-farm payroll figures continued today in early trading, before running out of steam. Investors shrugged off more disappointing eurozone data, with confidence at its worst level for a year, and pushed shares higher. But an early reversal on Wall Street took some of the shine off, and European markets closed off their best levels. The closing scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished up 35.74 points or 0.55% at 6563.65 Germany\u2019s Dax added 0.15% to 9209.51 France\u2019s Cac climbed 0.11% to 4286.52 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended 0.74&amp; higher at 10,645.7 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB was an exception, down 0.4% at 20,119.73 In the US, the Dow Jones Industrial Average - up more than 200 points on Friday - is currently 57 points or 0.33% lower. On that note, it\u2019s time to close up for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. Rio Tinto\u2019s US shares have jumped following a Bloomberg report that Glencore was laying the groundwork for a potential $160bn merger. The report said: As a preliminary step, Glencore has reached out to Aluminium Corp of China, the Chinese state-backed company that is Rio Tinto\u2019s largest shareholder, to gauge its interest in a potential deal, said two of the people, who asked not to be identified because the matter is private. The discussions with the company, which is known as Chinalco and controls about 9.8% of Rio, took place in recent weeks, one of them said. Rio executives are well aware of Glencore Chief Executive Officer Ivan Glasenberg\u2019s interest in a deal, which has been made clear in informal settings, the people said. However, no talks are underway between the two companies, no formal offer has been made, none is likely before the end of 2014, and Glencore could decide against an offer, they said. That disclaimer has not stopped Rio\u2019s ADRs in the US: The full Bloomberg story is here. Over in Greece, prime minister Antonis Samaras has today requested a vote of confidence in his government in a bid to quash growing speculation of early elections and the political instability it has spawned. From Athens our correspondent Helena Smith reports: Presenting the request at the office of the president of the parliament, the Greek prime minister said he had sought to seek a vote of confidence in his government as outlined \u201cin article 84 of the constitution.\u201d The gamble \u2013 a high risk affair in light of the growing distaste of governing MPs for the reforms the ruling coalition is under pressure to take by international creditors \u2013 was decided as the only riposte left to calls for early elections by the main opposition Syriza party. Both Samaras and his junior partner socialist leader Evangelos Venizelos see the vote as the best way of not only silencing dissidents but bolstering support for their shaky coalition. Popular approval may not be behind the government \u2013 polls have steadfastly put Syriza in the lead \u2013 but the hope is that when push comes to shove parliamentarians will back the coalition in the name of political stability. Although clinging to power with a wafer thin majority of four, Samaras\u2019 two-party administration also hopes to pick up votes from independents sitting in the 300-seat House. The ballot, eleven months after Syriza engineered a similar vote, would buy the two leaders valuable time to forge ahead with reforms under the guise of having a popular mandate. In addition to the 2015 budget the Samaras administration has to press ahead with scores of unpopular structural reforms by the end of the year at the behest of Greece\u2019s \u201ctroika\u201d of creditors at the EU, ECB and IMF. Piling on the pressure Syriza\u2019s leader, the telegenic Alexis Tsipras, has said the measures will only lead the country \u201cfurther down the road to destruction.\u201d Confidence votes are normally seen as a last resort for a government. But if (as seems likely) Samaras is victorious political commentators unanimously agree it will force Tsipras into the shadows \u2013 at least until presidential elections in February when parliament will need to replace the incumbent head of state Carolos Papaoulias. Earlier, presenting the 2015 budget, deputy finance minister Christos Staikouras boldly declared that the worst of the economic crisis was over. After a 200 point rise on Wall Street on Friday as US jobs figures beat expectations, markets are heading higher once more. The Dow Jones Industrial Average has added another 70 points or 0.42% in initial trading, helping to prolong the earlier rises in Europe. So the FTSE 100 has risen 57 points or 0.89% while Germany\u2019s Dax - closed on Friday and playing a bit of catch up - is up 1% while France\u2019s Cac has climbed 0.77%. Virgin Atlantic\u2019s UK domestic airline Little Red has stalled after just over 18 months in service. My colleague Gwyn Topham writes: The airline has struggled to fill seats on its services linking London Heathrow with Edinburgh, Aberdeen and Manchester, and finally admitted defeat after weeks of speculation that the operation would be axed. Virgin\u2019s daily services to Manchester will end in March 2015, while the Scottish services will cease next September. Sir Richard Branson, Virgin Atlantic\u2019s president, claimed that Little Red, which was operated by Aer Lingus for Virgin on a \u201cwet lease\u201d, ie with the Irish airline\u2019s planes and crew in Virgin colours, had benefited consumers but \u201cthe odds were stacked against us\u201d. It came into being in March 2013 after competition authorities made British Airways relinquish Heathrow slots for domestic flying, in the wake of BA\u2019s takeover of bmi. While over a million customers have so far flown on Little Red, Virgin admitted that demand has been predominantly from point-to-point customers rather than the connecting traffic it had hoped for, feeding more passengers on to its more profitable long haul routes. Full story here: Virgin Atlantic scraps Little Red domestic services Here is my colleague Patrick Wintour\u2019s report on Manuel Valls\u2019 speech: The French prime minister, Manuel Valls, has told a City audience in London that his drastic reform programme will extend to the introduction of Sunday shopping in Paris, and the major towns of France. Valls is fighting on all fronts to lift the French economy out of the doldrums, and may face a confrontation with the new European commission to tolerate a deficit that breaches EU limits. Valls was in London to meet David Cameron and persuade fellow EU leaders that he is trying to take the french economy on the path to structural reform, including an end to the 35-hour working week. Describing it as \u201cbad news to give you here in London\u201d, Valls said shops would open on Sundays in Paris and promised museums will be open seven days week. He said socialists were pro-business and he would use his time in power to transform the country. He said he had accepted the apology from the John Lewis managing director who described France as sclerotic, hopeless and downbeat. Valls pointed out that the French economy was the fifth largest in the world and second largest in Europe. Insisting his new government was pro-business, he said the top 75% tax rate would be gone by January. Cameron was told by Valls that he wanted Britain to remain a central figure in the EU, saying the EU without the UK would be amputated. But he also warned the city of London would lose much if it turned its back on Europe. Patrick\u2019s full story is here. The AFP newswire have written up Valls\u2019 speech, including a good line about how a Socialist PM visiting the City is a major event (which I missed in the earlier summary) French PM bids to restore pro-business stance in London French Prime Minister Manuel Valls on Monday defended his Socialist government against a stream of criticism of its economic and business reforms during a visit to London. Valls met British counterpart David Cameron and British and French executives, giving a speech at the Guildhall in the heart of the British capital\u2019s City financial district. French President Francois Hollande was elected in part on a tough line towards the financial sector. Valls has provoked anger on the left of the Socialist partly by defending stalled reforms to cut charges on companies and to cut public spending, and praising the importance of businesses. \u201cMy government is pro-business!\u201d he told British business leaders in English, quipping: \u201cA French prime minister in the City is an event. A Socialist French prime minister in the City is a revolution!\u201d In response to rising euroscepticism in Britain, Valls also warned that the country - and in particular the City - would \u201close a lot\u201d if it were to \u201cturn its back\u201d on Europe. \u201cFrance wants Britain to stay in the European Union,\u201d he said, calling also for joint action to reform Europe and make it \u201cmore intelligible to bring it closer to the people\u201d. He added: \u201cThere is a choice that we can and should make together: reform Europe to put growth, competitiveness and jobs back at the heart of its priorities.\u201d Relations have improved between London and Paris since 2012, when Cameron said Britain would \u201croll out the red carpet\u201d for French executives following the election of President Francois Hollande, who had declared the finance sector \u201chis enemy\u201d. The French prime minister, who arrived in London late on Sunday, began his trip by meeting the French business community in London, home to more than 350,000 French people. He admitted that France\u2019s economic growth had been stuck in a \u201clong breakdown\u201d but said people should not \u201cresign themselves\u201d and encouraged British businesses to invest in France. Finland\u2019s man in London, ambassador Pekka Huhtaniemi, also flags up Manuel Valls\u2019 warning that the European Union would be \u2018amputated\u2019 without Britain. Valls said it would be a \u201cdisaster\u201d for Britain and the EU if the UK were to leave. Vincenzo Scarpetta of the Open Europe think tank reckons Manuel Valls mounted a solid defence of France\u2019s plans in his Guildhall speech. But he also warns that Valls downplayed the political situation in Paris (where the National Front party won its first seats in the Senate last month) From Brussels, Martin Wittenberg of Euros / Agency reckons David Cameron should now respond by promoting his own pro-EU credentials The City of London Corporation\u2019s Linda Cross welcomed Valls\u2019 pro-enterprise message: Fiona Tait, director of International Markets at Deloitte, was struck by Valls\u2019 warning that Britain should not turn its back on Europe. France\u2019s prime minister has insisted that his government is \u2018pro-business\u2019, on a trip to the UK to promote Paris\u2019s economic reforms and fend off criticism of its weak growth. Speaking to an audience of top British executives in the Guildhall, Manuel Valls insisted that France could, and would, reform its economy. He declared: My government is pro-business. and also hit out at business people who unfairly criticise the French economy. France, Valls pointed out, is still the world\u2019s fifth-largest economy (although the UK is expected to overtake this year). The visit was overshadowed, or perhaps enlivened, by the row last Friday after John Lewis\u2019s managing director said France was \u201cfinished\u2019 and dubbed Gare du Nord the \u201csqualor pit of Europe\u201d. Valls said France\u2019s is the regular target of \u2018biased\u2019 attacks from the UK press. But he has accepted Andy Street\u2019s apology, and even agreed that the station needs upgrading. He argued that France and the UK face similar challenges, and told Guildhall that the 75% top rate of tax introduced by Francois Hollande will be reversed next year. That policy was credited with driving some high earners across the channel. Valls also warned London that French shops and museums will soon be fighting back, by opening on Sundays. He told the City that \u201cI have two years and half ahead of me\u201d to reform France\u2019s economy. And he also hit out against euroscepticism, saying the City would suffer if Britain left the EU. Valls is visiting London on a day of generally bad economic news from Europe.... Concern is growing that the eurozone is sliding into recession, after investor confidence in the region hit its lowest level in almost 18 months. Sentix\u2019s senior analyst, Dr. Sebastian Wanke, who compiled the report, warned that investors are increasingly gloomy about current conditions, and future prospects.: A formal euro-area recession \u2013 two consecutive quarters of shrinking output \u2013 becomes more and more probable. German factories have suffered the biggest drop in orders since 2009, as demand from home and abroad weakens. Analysts say Russian sanctions and the weak euro economy are hitting the region\u2019s largest member. Carsten Brzeski of ING explained: \u201cIt\u2019s not only a Putin fear factor - Germany is also suffering from the weakness of its euro zone peers.\u201d Euro Disney, the Paris-based theme park, has announced a $1bn refinancing plan in a bid to cut debts and attract more visitors. Shares tumbled 20% in early trading, and are now down 8% in Paris. Greece has presented its draft 2015 budget, and pledged to return to growth this year. UK car registrations have hit their highest level for a September in a decade. However, growth may be tailing off.... And that\u2019s the end of Valls\u2019 Guildhall speech. He\u2019ll be off to meet Ed Miliband later -- I\u2019ll pull together a lunchtime summary now.... Valls also warns that Europe faces rising support for euroscepticism and populist parties. Back in Guildhall, UK business leaders are quizzing the French prime minister. Valls ducks a question from the chief executive of Prudential, Tidjane Thiam, who asks about France\u2019s deficit reduction targets: Before speaking at Guildhall today, Manuel Valls met with David Cameron at 10 Downing Street to discus how to respond to the Islamic State. They also spoke about economic issues; speaking before the meeting, UK PM conceded that the two countries do face similar problems: Here\u2019s the Press Association\u2019s take: David Cameron and French prime minister Manuel Valls have met to discuss measures to prevent would-be jihadis travelling to Iraq and Syria to join forces with Islamic State (IS) militants. The Prime Minister welcomed Mr Valls to Downing Street for talks about the international effort to combat IS - also known as Isil - and he said the UK and France were \u201cstrong allies\u201d. The pair were also expected to talk about the economic challenges facing the two countries during the meeting at No 10. Both France and the UK have launched air strikes against IS fighters in Iraq, and both nations have seen hundreds of their citizens travel to the Middle East to potentially link up with militant groups. Mr Cameron said: \u201cThere\u2019s a lot to discuss today. As strong allies within the European Union and Nato, we both face the same challenge in responding to Isil in Iraq and Syria. \u201cI\u2019m sure we will discuss that and how we prevent fighters from leaving our shores to go to these countries.\u201d On the economy, Mr Cameron acknowledged that he was from \u201cdifferent political families\u201d to the French socialist, but he said the two countries faced the same challenges. Mr Cameron said: \u201cI\u2019m sure we will have a lot to talk about on the economy, where the bilateral relationship is very strong, we both have the same challenges of getting our economies to grow and generate jobs and wealth. \u201cWhile we are from different political families, I\u2019m sure there is a lot that we can share in terms of experience about what needs to happen.\u201d Valls also argues that Europe needs a weaker currency, to help exporters compete: The euro has fallen by 10% in the last six months, from $1.38 to $1.25. But Valls wants it to keep depreciating.... Valls isn\u2019t shying away from the problems in Europe\u2019s economy; he\u2019s arguing that the eurozone must rethink its monetary policies (a hint that the ECB should launch more stimulus measures). The eurozone cannot be the only region without growth, he adds. That\u2019s a timely warning. As covered earlier (details), investor confidence in the eurozone has tumbled this month, suggesting another recession is looming. Especially with German factory orders tumbling in August (details)... The French PM also touches on Britain\u2019s position in the European Union (earlier today he met with David Cameron at Downing Street). Valls declares that \u201cEuropeans must remain united and strong\u201d, and warns that the City would suffer if Britain quit the EU. More seriously, Manuel Valls says that \u201cI have two years and half ahead of me\u201d in which he can reform French economy. He\u2019s confident that he can achieve that goal, he adds. John Lewis\u2019s managing director may have hit home with his attack on the Gare de Nurd as \u2018the squalor pit of Europe\u2019. Prime minister Valls gets his Guildhall audience giggling by declaring that the station does need upgrading: As an example of the new economic powerhouse brewing over the channel, French PM Valls tells his audience that shops and museums will soon be open seven days a week! Valls insists that France can, and will, reform its economy: Manuel Valls insists that his government is \u201cpro-business\u201d, speaking in English to get his point across to the Guildhall audience. And he hopes that France can transform itself into an \u201ceconomic powerhouse\u201d. Valls says the attack on France by John Lewis\u2019s MD was out of line, given it is the 5th largest economy in the world. Prime minister Manuel Valls is now blasting the \u201ceveryday bias\u201d seen in the UK press against France, saying there are regular attacks in British newspapers towards his country. He takes a pop at John Lewis\u2019s managing director, who apologised last Friday for saying France was \u201csclerotic, hopeless and downbeat\u201d. My colleague Sean Farrell is tweeting from the Guildhall: Heads-up. France\u2019s prime minister, Manuel Valls, has begun speaking at the Guildhall in the City of London. He\u2019s started by defending his visit to the cradle of Anglo-Saxon capitalism: Over in Greece, the government has declared that it will exit its recession this year, as it outlines its 2015 budget. Deputy Finance Minister Christos Staikouras boldly declared that the worst of Greece\u2019s economic crisis is over: \u201cThe country is entering a long period of sustained economic growth rates and primary surpluses that will bring growth in employment, reducing unemployment and improving living standards for all citizens.\u201d \u201cThis is the result of unprecedented sacrifices made by Greek society, households and businesses. These sacrifices must not be wasted.\u201d Saikouras also told reporters that the draft document will be debated \u201cin an environment of stabilisation of the country\u2019s public finances and the return of its international credibility.\u201d Here are the highlights from the budget, from Athens correspondent Helena Smith: After six years of recession - the longest in recorded history - Greece\u2019s national output was poised to grow by 0.6% this year, after falling by 3.9% in 2013, he said. After triggering the euro zone crisis and being forced to enact excoriating austerity, the debt-stricken country was on track to post a primary surplus (before repayment of interest payments) of \u20ac3.6bn euro, the equivalent of 2% of GDP. At 0.8%, the public deficit had also improved from the 1.9% and 5.8% that it showed in 2013 and 2012 respectively. Unemployment, at 27%, was the the highest in the EU - some 1.4 million Greeks are out of work. The nation\u2019s public debt load expected to come in at \u20ac318.6bn euro or 175% of GDP. But it\u2019s not all good news, Helena adds: Protestors from the public and private sector are expected to take to the streets later in the day in a mass display of the opposition to the cost-cutting policies that have seen Greece\u2019s GDP shrink by over 25% since the outbreak of the crisis. Now this is serious, the price of coffee has surged by almost 9% today, a two and a half-year high. The benchmark price of Aribica coffee for delivery next March jumped to $2.29 a pound. It was triggered by concerns over Brazil\u2019s weather, where the usual October rain hasn\u2019t arrived (yet).... As if we\u2019d not had enough bad news already, the FT\u2019s Ralph Atkins flags up another sell signal: Back in the City, shares in UK web retailer ASOS are up almost 6% on speculation that Amazon might be planning a bid... Further bad news for Europe this morning... investors in Europe are at their most pessimistic in over a year, suggesting that the region is falling into recession. That\u2019s according to research group Sentix, whose index of investor morale tumbled to minus 13.7 this month, the lowest since May 2013. Sentix\u2019s senior analyst, Dr. Sebastian Wanke, warns: As the assessment of the current situation and the 6-month expectations both are now clearly in negative territory, the Sentix indices point currently to a recession in the euro area. The slide in sentiment (for the third month running) comes despite the European Central Bank\u2019s latest stimulus scheme. It announced last week that it would start buying packages of debt from eurozone banks to encourage lending and growth in the region. The poll took place between Thursday (the ECB\u2019s last meeting) and Saturday. Sentix suggests that investors may have lost faith in the ECB: Obviously, the ECB\u2019s monetary sword has lost its power in this regard \u2013 at least for the moment. The survey also found that German investors are less confident, with future expectations already in negative territory. And Sentix\u2019s measure of the global economy also fell, to its lowest point since November 2012, as investors become more gloomy about future prospects. Wanke warns: According to the sentix indices the world economy thus is about to enter a downturn. Here\u2019s the full report (pdf). Shares in Euro Disney are sliding like Bambi on ice, after the ailing theme park chain announced a \u20ac1bn funding deal backed by its US parent company this morning. The deal will see Euro Disney raise \u20ac420m from its shareholders in a rights issue. Walt Disney will also convert \u20ac600m of borrowings into shares, and delay scheduled repayments on its loans to Euro Disney until 2024. Euro Disney president Tomn Wolber blamed the \u201congoing economic challenges in Europe\u201d for pushing down visitor numbers at Pasis-based attraction, and driving up its debt pile to \u20ac1.75bn. Euro Disney hopes the debt restructuring and cash injection will allow it to invest in its business and attract more customer. Shares in Euro Disney are down 20% this morning. Full story: Euro Disney gets cash injection from US owner Britain\u2019s car industry has posted its strongest sales figure for a September in a decade. The Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders reported that 425,861 new vehicles were registered last month, a 5.6% jump, and the best September since 2004. UK car sales have now been rising for 31 months in a row. SMMT CEO Mike Hawes says that the new \u201864\u2019 numberplate had helped to push sales up: \u201cDemand for the new 64-plate has been boosted by intensifying confidence in the UK economy, with consumers attracted by a wide range of exciting, increasingly fuel-efficient, new cars. In the months since March \u2013 which saw an 18% jump in registrations \u2013 the growth has shown signs of levelling off as the market starts to find its natural running rate.\u201d Total sales during 2014 are 9.1% higher than a year ago, so - as this chart shows - September\u2019s figures may suggest growth is slowing. And this chart shows that the Ford Fiesta remains the most popular car: The Russian ruble has fallen to fresh record lows today, hitting the 40 rubles to the US dollar mark. Fears over Western sanctions, the strength of the Russian economy, and recent falls in the oil price have all driven the ruble lower in recent days. Here\u2019s the agenda of French prime minister Valls\u2019 visit to London today, from the French embassy. 8.30am Meets the French business community 10.00am Meets Prime Minister David Cameron at 10 Downing Street 11.00am Arrives at the Guildhall and delivers a speech 3.45pm Meets Ed Miliband, Leader of the Opposition Just in, Germany\u2019s building sector stabilised in September, having contracted in August. The monthly German construction PMI rose to 50.0, showing stagnation, up from 47.7 in August. European stock markets have risen in early trading, despite the weak German factory orders. Traders are catching up with Friday night\u2019s rally on Wall Street, after a strong US jobs report showed the unemployment rate had fallen to just 5.9%. Germany\u2019s DAX is leading the risers, up 1.2%, having been closed on Friday for a holiday. Tesco is leading the risers in London, having fallen steadily since it admitted overstating profits by \u00a3250m a forntight ago. Speaking of which.....Tesco board faces new questions after purchase of $50m corporate jet There was one flicker of good news in the German data; July\u2019s orders were revised higher: Nick Bubb, retail analyst. says Tesco\u2019s boardroom reinforcements should cheer the City, as speculation of a cash call swirls: Embattled Tesco shareholders will be pleased to see today\u2019s news that two heavyweight non-execs are to join the Tesco Board, but less pleased if they are being softened up for a rights issue... Meanwhile in the UK, troubled supermarket chain Tesco has boosted its board with two new non-executive directors. The chief executive of food group Compass, and the former boss of IKEA, both join next month, as Tesco struggles to stem its falling sales and the revelation that it overstated profits by \u00a3250m. More here. Carsten Brzeski, senior economist at ING, has warned that today\u2019s German factory orders figures \u201cclearly bodes ill for the fourth quarter,\u201d. He says that the crisis over Ukraine is one factor, but not the only one: \u201cIt\u2019s not only a Putin fear factor - Germany is also suffering from the weakness of its euro zone peers.\u201d Looking back at the data.... orders from eurozone countries fell by 5.7%, while orders from the rest of the world are down 9.9% (compared to the 2.0% drop in domestic orders). Credit Agricole\u2019s Frederik Ducrozet points out German factories also saw weak demand for \u2018intermediate goods\u2019 (materials or product used to create other items): This handy graph from FastFT shows how German factory orders plummeted in August, at a rate not seen since the start of 2009: The 5.7% tumble in German factory suggests growth in the last quarter could be disappointing. Holger Sandte, chief European analyst at Nordea Markets in Copenhagen, cites various geopolitical concerns threatening Germany: \u201cThe outlook for the German economy is subdued and I\u2019m not sure we\u2019ll see growth in the third quarter. Looking forward, there are some signs for worry, from China to weakness in France, to the crisis in Russia.\u201d Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the financial markets, the world economy, business and finance. Worrying news from Europe -- German factories have suffered the biggest drop in new orders since the financial crisis was raging five years ago. The German economy ministry just reported that orders tumbled by 5.7% in August, more than twice as sharp a fall as expected. It\u2019s the biggest fall since the start of 2009; adding to concerns that Europe\u2019s largest economy is faltering. Overseas orders plunged by 8.4% compared to July, indicating that German firms are being hit by the weakness of the eurozone economy, and beyond. The domestic economy doesn\u2019t look too hot either, with orders from within Germany down by 2.0%. Demand for capital goods (heavy-duty machinery) was particularly weak, dropping by 8.5% month-on-month; foreign orders slid by 12%. The Economy Ministry blamed \u201csubdued economic developments\u2019 in the euro areas, and the uncertainly created by crises abroad, adding to the August summer slowdown. This comes just two weeks after German business confidence fell for the fifth month running. Reaction to follow.... Also coming up today: France\u2019s prime minister Manuel Valls arrives in London today to explain his economic strategy, just days after the head of John Lewis apologised for claiming that that French economy was \u2018finished\u2019 The PM\u2019s message is that France is serious about reforms, as Bloomberg reports: Valls, whose trip to London had been scheduled before Street\u2019s comments, begins his day meeting expatriates in the British capital, followed by one with Prime Minister David Cameron at 10am. He will then give a speech in the City, London\u2019s financial district, and then meet Labour Party leader Ed Miliband before heading back to Paris.

Popular approval may not be behind the government \u2013 polls have steadfastly put Syriza in the lead \u2013 but the hope is that when push comes to shove parliamentarians will back the coalition in the name of political stability.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"f495bdccb60f8e375df8e4fe8d62e642959d5d8a\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/10/6/1412608461665/95a66784-4bbb-44f2-950e-d05ff567e7ea-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Greek prime minister Antonis Samaras.

The ballot, eleven months after Syriza engineered a similar vote, would buy the two leaders valuable time to forge ahead with reforms under the guise of having a popular mandate. In addition to the 2015 budget the Samaras administration has to press ahead with scores of unpopular structural reforms by the end of the year at the behest of Greece\u2019s \u201ctroika\u201d of creditors at the EU, ECB and IMF. Piling on the pressure Syriza\u2019s leader, the telegenic Alexis Tsipras, has said the measures will only lead the country \u201cfurther down the road to destruction.\u201d<br></p> <p>Confidence votes are normally seen as a last resort for a government.

      "bodyText": "Senior staff from the Libyan sovereign wealth fund were taken on a lavish trip to Morocco during the reign of Muammar Gaddafi by a Goldman Sachs banker on which there was \u201cheavy drinking and girls involved\u201d, the high court was told on Monday. Details of the visit were contained in a witness statement released as part of proceedings for the lawsuit brought by the Libyan Investment Authority (LIA) over nine financial products it bought from Goldman Sachs in 2008 for more than $1bn (\u00a3624m). A lawyer on secondment to the LIA from law firm Allen &amp; Overy at the time said the Libyans had extremely limited financial knowledge and regarded the Goldman Sachs banker Youssef Kabbaj, who took them on the Moroccan trip, as a friend. They regarded Kabbaj as a \u201cvery close friend, trusted him 100% and were completely in awe of him,\u201d the lawyer, Catherine McDougall, said in her witness statement. Kabbaj has since left the bank. Mrs Justice Rose said she did not regard the details of the hospitality as as forming as any bias for the case or that there was any allegation of anything improper about the hospitality. McDougall left Allen &amp; Overy in 2008, shortly after returning from Libya where she said she had confronted Goldman Sachs bankers about the products being bought by the LIA, which was set up in 2006 to invest Libya\u2019s oil riches after sanctions against it had been lifted. McDougall said the LIA staff were astonished to learn they had not bought shares but instead had taken bets on future share prices through synthetic products. These products ended up being worthless when they came to the end of their lifespan three years later. The LIA says Goldman made an upfront profit of $350m (\u00a3218m). She disputed a statement issued in Goldman\u2019s defence by one of its bankers, Andrea Vella, who said the LIA staff were financially literate. She quoted Vella as saying: \u201cI believed at the time, and still believe, that the key individuals within the management of the LIA at the time were perfectly capable of understanding, and in fact did understand, the disputed trades, the risks they involved and the potential benefits to the LIA which they offered.\u201d Goldman Sachs said in a statement: \u201cWe continue to believe this case is entirely without merit and intend to contest it vigorously as it moves through the legal process.\u201d According to McDougall\u2019s witness statement, LIA staff told her Kabbaj had paid for items during the Moroccan trip \u201cmostly on his Goldman corporate credit card\u201d. She said staff at the LIA had also told her how Kabbaj would \u201ctake them out in London for expensive nights out, again paid for on his Goldman Sachs credit card\u201d. She described asking LIA officials if they had conducted due diligence on the trades that are the subject of the court case and got the reply \u201cdue what?\u201d In its defence, Goldman said the staff of the LIA were experienced professionals and knew what they were buying. \u201cThis claim is a paradigm of buyers\u2019 remorse. The LIA entered into a series of bargains with GSI as the counterparty, which have turned out badly because of the market collapse in 2008. The bargains were commercial ones which the LIA decided to take,\u201d Goldman said. \u201cThe disputed trades were not difficult to understand,\u201d Goldman argued, and said the LIA was \u201canticipating very large profits\u201d before markets tumbled after the collapse of Lehman Brothers in September 2008. The case management hearing is expected to continue on Tuesday before the case formally begins next year.",

      "body": "<p>Investors moved tentatively away from defensive stocks on Monday as a little confidence returned to the market, to the benefit of mining companies and banks.</p> <p>After heavy losses in the past two weeks, the <strong>FTSE 100</strong> had regained some ground on Friday after better than expected US jobs figures, and the cautiously positive mood continued despite some more disappointing economic data from the eurozone. With European markets also moving forward, the FTSE 100 finished 35.74 points higher at 6563.65, helped by a seemingly calmer situation in Hong Kong after the pro-democracy protests.</p> <p>Among the recently hard hit miners, <strong>Antofagasta</strong> added 26p to 706.5p as copper and other base metals edged higher as the recent surge in the dollar saw a pause. <strong>Anglo American</strong> was 33.5p better at \u00a313.48 and with gold and silver off their recent lows, precious metals miner <strong>Fresnillo</strong> rose 25.5p to 745.5p. David Madden, market analyst at IG said:</p> <blockquote> In London calm has been restored to the markets as the protests in Hong Kong peter out. Mining companies are befitting on both sides, and increased stability in China is crucial for the natural resources sector with higher metal prices being the icing on the cake. <br> </blockquote> <p>Among the financials, <strong>Barclays</strong> was 7.7p better at 232.3p while <strong>HSBC </strong>was 1.8p higher at 634p.</p> <p>But <strong>United Utilities</strong> was down 5p at 805p and <strong>Shire </strong>slipped 25p to \u00a354.30.</p> <p><strong>BG</strong> rose 27p to \u00a310.93 after it said it had received $350m from the Egyptian government as part of a commitment to repay outstanding debts to the energy industry. BG still has an outstanding balance of $1.2bn with Cairo, and the company said it was working with the government to resolve the situation.</p> <p>Elsewhere airline companies were in demand. <strong>EasyJet</strong> added 8p to \u00a314.67 as Citigroup raised its price target from \u00a316 to \u00a316.70, while <strong>International Airlines Group</strong> climbed 6.1p to 371.3p as chief executive Willie Walsh told Expansion that Spain's Iberia could be as profitable as British Airways.</p> <p><strong>Tesco</strong> was up 4.6p at 176.75p following news the beleaguered supermarket was boosting its board with the appointment of two new non-executive directors, Richard Cousins of Compass and Mikael Ohlsson, formerly of Ikea.</p> <p><strong>Marks &amp; Spencer</strong> added 5.4p to 405.9p despite one of the company's joint brokers, Citgroup, cutting its price target from 440p to 400p with a neutral rating. Citi analyst Richard Edwards said:</p> <blockquote> Following the recent unseasonally warm weather patterns, we have reduced our second quarter general merchandise like for like sales forecast to -4% (from -1%).... As a consequence... we have reduced our 2015 M&amp;S pretax profit forecast by \u00a310m to \u00a3650m. <br> Despite an assumption of around 150 basis point per annum general merchandise gross margin progress over the next three years, we fear that the ongoing sales channel shift from store-based to online sales will drive adverse group operating cost leverage as store-based like for like sales fade. In combination, these profit and loss dynamics are expected to limit 2014-17 estimated earnings per share growth to around 5% per annum.

      "bodyText": "Investors moved tentatively away from defensive stocks on Monday as a little confidence returned to the market, to the benefit of mining companies and banks. After heavy losses in the past two weeks, the FTSE 100 had regained some ground on Friday after better than expected US jobs figures, and the cautiously positive mood continued despite some more disappointing economic data from the eurozone. With European markets also moving forward, the FTSE 100 finished 35.74 points higher at 6563.65, helped by a seemingly calmer situation in Hong Kong after the pro-democracy protests. Among the recently hard hit miners, Antofagasta added 26p to 706.5p as copper and other base metals edged higher as the recent surge in the dollar saw a pause. Anglo American was 33.5p better at \u00a313.48 and with gold and silver off their recent lows, precious metals miner Fresnillo rose 25.5p to 745.5p. David Madden, market analyst at IG said: In London calm has been restored to the markets as the protests in Hong Kong peter out. Mining companies are befitting on both sides, and increased stability in China is crucial for the natural resources sector with higher metal prices being the icing on the cake. Among the financials, Barclays was 7.7p better at 232.3p while HSBC was 1.8p higher at 634p. But United Utilities was down 5p at 805p and Shire slipped 25p to \u00a354.30. BG rose 27p to \u00a310.93 after it said it had received $350m from the Egyptian government as part of a commitment to repay outstanding debts to the energy industry. BG still has an outstanding balance of $1.2bn with Cairo, and the company said it was working with the government to resolve the situation. Elsewhere airline companies were in demand. EasyJet added 8p to \u00a314.67 as Citigroup raised its price target from \u00a316 to \u00a316.70, while International Airlines Group climbed 6.1p to 371.3p as chief executive Willie Walsh told Expansion that Spain's Iberia could be as profitable as British Airways. Tesco was up 4.6p at 176.75p following news the beleaguered supermarket was boosting its board with the appointment of two new non-executive directors, Richard Cousins of Compass and Mikael Ohlsson, formerly of Ikea. Marks &amp; Spencer added 5.4p to 405.9p despite one of the company's joint brokers, Citgroup, cutting its price target from 440p to 400p with a neutral rating. Citi analyst Richard Edwards said: Following the recent unseasonally warm weather patterns, we have reduced our second quarter general merchandise like for like sales forecast to -4% (from -1%).... As a consequence... we have reduced our 2015 M&amp;S pretax profit forecast by \u00a310m to \u00a3650m. Despite an assumption of around 150 basis point per annum general merchandise gross margin progress over the next three years, we fear that the ongoing sales channel shift from store-based to online sales will drive adverse group operating cost leverage as store-based like for like sales fade. In combination, these profit and loss dynamics are expected to limit 2014-17 estimated earnings per share growth to around 5% per annum. In this context we derive a neutral rating on the shares. Among the mid-caps, Just Retirement jumped 6p to 126.3p as Deutsche Bank raised its recommendation from hold to buy, saying: The monoline annuity providers have been heavily de-rated since the March budget.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Silicon Valley stalwart Hewlett-Packard announced on Monday that it will split itself into two companies. The 75-year-old Palo Alto-based company, one of the original tech titans, had previously fought off calls for a break-up, but has now decided that it will separate its \u201centerprise\u201d arm \u2013 aimed at business and including servers and data storage equipment, software and services \u2013 from its business selling personal computers and printers. HP came close to a break-up in 2011 after its ill-fated acquisition of UK software company Autonomy. But the chief executive officer at the time, Meg Whitman, rejected the idea. \u201cTogether we are stronger,\u201d she said. HP reorganized itself in 2012 to combine the PC business with its more profitable printer operation. Monday\u2019s announcement follows news that the company would cut 5,000 more, bringing the total number of layoffs in 2014 to 34,000. On Monday, Whitman argued that much had changed since 2011. \u201cOur work during the past three years has significantly strengthened our core businesses to the point where we can more aggressively go after the opportunities created by a rapidly changing market,\u201d said Whitman, now chairman, president and CEO. She said the split would \u201cprovide each new company with the independence, focus, financial resources and flexibility they need to adapt quickly to market and customer dynamics, while generating long-term value for shareholders.\u201d The new business-services focused company will be called Hewlett-Packard Enterprise and the PC and printer business will be called HP Inc. Whitman, a billionaire businesswoman who made her fortune at eBay, will maintain power in both companies. She will be chairman of HP Inc and CEO of Hewlett-Packard Enterprise. Patricia Russo, Hewlett-Packard\u2019s lead independent director and a former chief executive officer of Lucent Technologies and its successor, Alcatel-Lucent, will be chairman of the enterprise company. Australian Dion Weisler, an executive in the PC and printer operation, is to be CEO HP Inc. The news was applauded by activist investor Ralph Whitworth, founder of Relational Investors and a former chairman of HP\u2019s board. \u201cHP\u2019s board and management have made a brilliant value-enhancing move at the perfect time in the turnaround,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cThe new companies will be better positioned to address today\u2019s light-speed market dynamics and customer needs, and with distinct and compelling financial profiles and strong leadership teams, accelerate growth and shareholder value creation.\u201d This is the second time in a week that a top-tier tech company has taken up plans for a split that had been pushed for by investors but which management had previously rejected. Last Tuesday eBay announced plans to spin off PayPal, its fast-growing payments business, from the online auction site that Whitman once led. Again the company argued a changing competitive landscape meant splitting off the two businesses would give each a better opportunity to compete. The changes at HP come amid a generational shift among its peers at Dell, IBM, Intel and Microsoft \u2013 all of whom have changed chiefs, sold off businesses or gone private. Pressure for change has built with the rise of mobile computing connected to cloud systems. \u201cThe age of the customer is changing a lot of things in the tech industry, especially for companies like HP that feature an enormous portfolio traditionally focused on hardware and maintenance services,\u201d said Peter Burris, vice-president and research director at Forrester. \u201cThe pressure is on to shift the focus to software and related business technology services, which is where customers, investors, and partners see greater opportunity and value.\u201d \u201cNo-one digitally disrupts by building multibillion dollar processor fabs [fabrications] any more. What companies need to do is differentiate on software that improves business technology,\u201d added Burris.",

    "webTitle": "Virgin Atlantic scraps Little Red domestic services", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Virgin Atlantic has announced plans to scrap its domestic airline, Little Red, after just 18 months. The carrier has struggled to fill seats on its flights linking London Heathrow with Edinburgh, Aberdeen and Manchester, and finally admitted defeat after weeks of speculation that the operation would be axed. Little Red\u2019s daily services to Manchester will end in March; its Scottish services will cease in September. Sir Richard Branson, the Virgin Atlantic president, claimed the venture had benefited consumers but \u201cthe odds were stacked against us\u201d. Little Red launched in March 2013 after European competition authorities made British Airways relinquish Heathrow slots for domestic flying after its takeover of bmi. While more than a million passengers have flown on its domestic routes, Virgin Atlantic admitted that demand had been predominantly from point-to-point customers rather than the connecting traffic it had hoped for, feeding more passengers on to its more profitable long-haul routes. The Virgin Atlantic chief executive, Craig Kreeger, said: \u201cLittle Red came about through an enduring passion at Virgin Atlantic to make a difference for our customers. We really wanted it to be a success and everyone involved worked extremely hard and has given it their best efforts. \u201cIt was always a huge challenge on behalf of the consumer, as the totally inadequate number of slots made available by the European commission did not deliver close to BA\u2019s network position, even when supplemented by our own slots to fly between Heathrow and Manchester. The time lag between the takeover of bmi and our entering the market also meant Little Red initially faced an uphill battle to win recognition and convert customers to its services.\u201d Virgin Atlantic \u2013 which is 51% owned by Branson, with the remainder controlled by Delta Air Lines of the US \u2013 said Little Red bookings had been rising over the course of the year. But data from the Civil Aviation Authority released in June showed that Little Red\u2019s load factor, or percentage of occupied seats, was as little as 37.6%, far adrift of competitors easyJet and BA. Little Red was operated for Virgin Atlantic by Ireland\u2019s Aer Lingus on a wet lease basis, meaning that the Dublin-based carrier supplied the crew and the aircraft, albeit in Virgin colours. Virgin Atlantic expected the venture to struggle for profitability, but hoped the increased network and connections would prove to be sufficiently valuable to make the routes worthwhile, despite the losses bmi had incurred in providing similar services. Landing in Edinburgh at the launch of Little Red, Branson lifted his kilt to reveal underpants emblazoned \u201cstiff competition\u201d. But on Monday, he conceded that it had been an unequal battle: \u201cWhen the competition authorities allowed British Airways to take over British Midland and all of its slots, we feared there was little we could do to challenge BA\u2019s huge domestic and European network built through decades of dominance. \u201cTo remedy this, we were offered a meagre package of slots with a number of constraints on how to use them and we decided to lease a few planes on a short-term basis to give it our best shot. The odds were stacked against us and sadly we just couldn\u2019t attract enough corporate business on these routes.\u201d British Airways\u2019 chief executive, Willie Walsh, recently predicted the demise of Little Red, saying he was \u201cdelighted\u201d. Last week, he said: \u201cIt\u2019s looking terrible. The fact is that they are struggling \u2013 you cannot make money flying planes that are less than half full. I said it would be a mistake and am delighted to be proven correct.\u201d The slots at Heathrow that were granted to Virgin Atlantic will revert to BA unless another carrier applies to take over the short-haul routes from Little Red. Virgin Atlantic said it remained committed to its long-haul operations in Manchester and Scotland, from where it flies seasonal routes to US holiday destinations. The short-haul carrier\u2019s demise came after a major review of Virgin Atlantic\u2019s wider network, which saw a number of destinations including Mumbai, Cape Town and Tokyo axed as it focuses on profitable transatlantic routes. Virgin Atlantic is planning a \u00a3300m investment to improve its planes and lounges over the next four years as it attempts to return firmly to the black. The airline\u2019s first Boeing 787 Dreamliner will enter into service this month. Kreeger said the airline would be back in profit by the end of 2014, after making substantial losses in recent years, totalling more than \u00a3300m from 2009-13. Virgin Atlantic stressed that passengers could continue to book with Little Red until the service ends, and it would be increasing its air-miles incentives to entice more customers aboard its half-empty planes.",

I said it would be a mistake and am delighted to be proven correct.\u201d</p> <p>The slots at Heathrow that were granted to Virgin Atlantic will revert to BA unless another carrier applies to take over the short-haul routes from Little Red.</p> <p>Virgin Atlantic said it remained committed to its long-haul operations in Manchester and Scotland, from where it flies seasonal routes to US holiday destinations.</p> <p>The short-haul carrier\u2019s demise came after a major review of Virgin Atlantic\u2019s wider network, which saw a number of destinations including Mumbai, Cape Town and Tokyo axed as it focuses on profitable transatlantic routes.</p> <p>Virgin Atlantic is planning a \u00a3300m investment to improve its planes and lounges over the next four years as it attempts to return firmly to the black. The airline\u2019s first Boeing 787 Dreamliner will enter into service this month.</p> <p>Kreeger said the airline would be back in profit by the end of 2014, after making substantial losses in recent years, totalling more than \u00a3300m from 2009-13.</p> <p>Virgin Atlantic stressed that passengers could continue to book with Little Red until the service ends, and it would be increasing its air-miles incentives to entice more customers aboard its half-empty planes.</p>",

Five months after leaving Reckitt, however, Cousins suddenly has enough time to put in a shift at Tesco. How come? Neither Tesco\u2019s nor Compass\u2019s statements addresses the question. From the point of view of Compass shareholders, you would want a very good explanation from the newish chairman, Paul Walsh, why Cousins has been allowed to accept Tesco\u2019s offer.

Elsewhere airline companies were in demand. EasyJet has added 30p to \u00a314.89 as Citigroup raised its price target from \u00a316 to \u00a316.70, while International Airlines Group has climbed 6.3p to 371.5p as chief executive Willie Walsh told Expansion that Spain's Iberia could be as profitable as British Airways. Tesco is 2.6p better at 174.75p following news the beleaguered supermarket was boosting its board with the appointment of two new non-executive directors, Richard Cousins of Compass and Mikael Ohlsson, formerly of Ikea. Investors continued to be cautious on commodity companies, thanks to concerns about the outlook for key consumer China. BHP Billiton is down 1.5p at \u00a316.49 while Fresnillo has fallen 4p to 716p.",
