      "bodyText": "Secondary ticket site Viagogo\u2019s explanation for not sending a representative to the Tuesday\u2019s session of the Commons culture, media and sport select committee was ridiculous. The Swiss-based company, reported committee chair Damian Collins, said it doesn\u2019t have \u201cadequate representation\u201d in the UK to assist with inquiries. Pull the other one. It sells a lot of tickets in the UK, operates a UK website, has an office in central London and, in any case, the bosses in Geneva could easily hop on an easyJet flight. When Mike Ashley of Sports Direct claimed last year to be too busy to attend the business select committee, the MPs refused to take no for an answer. There was no need to summon the Commons\u2019 serjeant at arms. Chair Iain Wright just reminded Ashley that he could end up being in contempt of parliament. The reluctant witness soon changed his mind. In the case of Viagogo, the need for an appearance was underlined by evidence from promoters who specified that tickets for their events should not be re-sold and that entry would be refused if rule-dodging was detected. Keith Kenny, sales and ticketing director for upcoming musical Hamilton, said Viagogo had ignored his request not to offer tickets to the show. He accused Viagogo of flouting the Consumer Rights Act by failing to list block, row and seat numbers and display the ticket\u2019s face value prominently. He said its \u201cglossy but sneaky\u201d website doesn\u2019t inform customers clearly that tickets bought on the secondary market would be invalid. There is a fair argument that secondary ticketing, as once conceived, serves the legitimate purpose of matching willing buyer and willing seller. Individuals\u2019 plans change and even Ed Sheeran fans may find their enthusiasm has faded by the time the concert comes around. There ought to be a mechanism for selling unwanted tickets at a fair mark-up, say 10%, if the promoter is not offering the facility. Yet, in the hands of the likes of Viagogo, a valuable service has been transformed into something that \u201csmells of exploitation and deception,\u201d as one MP put it. How can Viagogo offer \u00a360 tickets for Hamilton for up to \u00a36,000 in the knowledge that the promoter of the show intends to refuse entry? The situation is absurd, or \u201cnaked fraudulent mis-selling,\u201d as another MP put it. If the MPs find that Viagogo founder and chief executive Eric Baker cannot be summoned from Switzerland, the man for some Ashley-style persuasion is the UK boss, Edward Parkinson. After that, the MPs should call trading standards officials. If the promoters\u2019 testimony is correct, resellers are breaking consumer rights legislation openly for substantial gain and officials are doing nothing. Carney\u2019s not-so-public warning Mark Carney is right: it would silly if Charlotte Hogg\u2019s exit from the Bank of England meant commercial banks were obliged to operate a \u201cone strike and you\u2019re out\u201d policy for senior staff. The governor has reassured banks that Threadneedle Street\u2019s definition of a proportionate response hasn\u2019t changed since Hogg resigned as deputy governor and chief operating officer last week. \u201cAn honest mistake that is freely admitted for which a firm takes prompt remedial action is not a firing offence,\u201d he said. Fair enough \u2013 and worth saying to avoid unintended consequences. There\u2019s just one quibble with Carney\u2019s description of the Bank\u2019s own response to Hogg\u2019s failure to disclose her brother\u2019s job at Barclays as required under a code she oversaw. He said Hogg \u201cwas formally warned in the strongest \u2013 and most public \u2013 of terms\u201d. She was warned, certainly, as MPs and the press learned. But is that the \u201cmost public\u201d of terms? The Bank did not issue a statement at the time. It intended to do so if Hogg had not resigned, but that\u2019s slightly different. YouTube: a publisher as well as a platform A striking aspect of the row over extremist material on YouTube is that owner Google didn\u2019t see it coming \u2013 or, more likely, couldn\u2019t be bothered to act until advertisers started to revolt. Even now, with the apologies arriving daily, it\u2019s hard to know what, precisely, will change. \u201cThe YouTube team is taking a hard look at our existing community guidelines to determine what content is allowed on the platform \u2013 not just what content can be monetised,\u201d says Philipp Schindler, Google\u2019s chief business officer. Jolly good, but \u201ca hard look\u201d is a holding position. Google has owned YouTube for a decade and only now, it seems, is it waking up to the fact that it isn\u2019t just running a \u201cplatform\u201d. It is in the publishing business and publishers are obliged to take some responsibility for what they distribute.",

      "bodyText": "A courier delivering parcels in central London has described being punished for refusing work after eight hours of cycling in snowy weather, saying he received no paid breaks or holiday pay. Andrew Boxer is the latest to take on the battle to be classified as a \u201cworker\u201d rather than an independent contractor. As a contractor for Excel, a courier company that was taken over by rival firm CitySprint last October, Boxer is not entitled to the national minimum wage, holiday pay, sickness benefit or a pension. Excel, which is in liquidation and currently operating as part of CitySprint, is not contesting the case. Boxer\u2019s case is the latest in a string of tribunals against gig economy employers and the second of four relating to the employment status of couriers being backed by the Independent Workers Union of Great Britain. All four cases are being overseen by Joanna Wade, the judge who in January ruled that CitySprint had wrongly classed courier Mags Dewhurst as a self-employed freelancer. The company is currently appealing against that ruling. A spokesperson said: \u201cThis case has demonstrated that there is still widespread confusion regarding the law in this uncertain area.\u201d Boxer told the central London employment tribunal that he could not turn down work during a shift or take time off without prior arrangement, and had no official break times. He said he had signed two contracts describing him as a self-employed subcontractor and incorrectly suggesting he could send someone with similar experience to cover his work for him because he had no option but to do so if he wanted to continue working for Excel. \u201cThere was no point in going back and saying \u2018I don\u2019t like this clause\u2019. They would\u2019ve just laughed at me,\u201d Boxer said. \u201cThe culture is such that people are scared of not getting work and losing the job because the power is in the controller\u2019s hands.\u201d Boxer said the only occasion he could remember turning down an allocated job was after having worked for about eight hours in pouring rain and intermittent snow with temperatures of about 0C. \u201cI simply did did not have the energy and physcial resource to pick [offered work] up. It would have been dangerous to have carried on,\u201d Boxer said. He said that he was told by his controller that as a result he could expect not to be given time off to attend auditions for acting work when he needed it. Boxer\u2019s lawyer, Casper Glyn, told the tribunal: \u201cIf you look at the reality, he is obviously a worker providing a personal service and not running his own business.\u201d Jason Moyer-Lee, general secretary of the IWGB, said the union wanted to challenge the industry-wide practice of classing couriers as independent contractors. The widespread use of self-employed workers is the subject of an inquiry by MPs while the prime minister has commissioned Tony Blair\u2019s former policy officer Matthew Taylor to look into the matter. The latest case adds to pressure on courier companies to change their way of working, particularly CitySprint, which has argued that the ruling is only relevant to the Dewhurst case.",

      "bodyText": "The governor of the Bank of England has defended his handling of the controversy surrounding his deputy Charlotte Hogg and said she shouldn\u2019t have had to resign for an honest mistake in failing to disclose that her brother worked at Barclays. In a speech at Threadneedle Street, Mark Carney said he had spoken to the top bosses of the major banks last week to tell them they should not feel under pressure to fire staff for making similar errors. Hogg, his number two, quit last week in the face of a damning report by the Treasury select committee into her failure to disclose that her brother worked at Barclays, which is regulated by the Bank of England. Hogg, promoted from chief operating officer only on 1 March, had told MPs that she had disclosed Quintin Hogg\u2019s role in line with the code of conduct she had herself drawn up. She later conceded she had not made the disclosure. Carney said the Bank\u2019s response had been tougher than would have been expected from the banks it regulates. Her salary rise had been blocked, she had been reprimanded and her assignments as chief operating officer \u2013 a role she still holds \u2013 had been reassigned. \u201cFor those who have questioned whether we get it, we do.

      "bodyText": "Oil theft is fuelling terrorist groups and drug cartels around the world, according to a new analysis. Mexican drug gangs can earn $90,000 (\u00a372,000) in seven minutes from tapping a pipeline of refined oil, while insurgents in Nigeria financially benefit from a share of the third of the country\u2019s refined oil exports that is lost to theft, said the Atlantic Council. The Washington DC-based thinktank, which mapped the scale of crime in the oil refining and processing end of the sector, said the issue had largely been ignored by authorities and law enforcement agencies so far. \u201cThis has been an invisible issue for many years, people do not recognise downstream oil theft as a problem. It\u2019s a multibillion-dollar thing that affects many people all over the world,\u201d said Ian M Ralby, the author of the analysis, which follows up on a study published in January. \u201cThese are global concerns because they affect the global economy and they affect global security,\u201d he added. The crimes take many forms, from straightforward theft from pipelines to smuggling to avoid taxes. Donkeys laden with jerry cans are used to smuggle oil across the closed border between oil-rich Algeria and Morocco. As a result an estimated 660,000 cars in Morocco and Tunisia run on fuel smuggled from Algeria, and border cities have sprung up to provide a property market to launder some of the funds. \u201cMany, many drops start to flood a house,\u201d said Ralby of the cumulative impact. Along with Nigeria, Mexico is one of the biggest oil theft hotspots, where an estimated $1bn of oil is stolen each year, with the Zetas cartel controlling nearly 40% of that market alone. Drug barons tapping pipelines in Mexico are also known to leave them open afterwards for farmers to win support. Europe is not exempt from the problem, with the analysis finding the EU lost about \u20ac4bn (\u00a33.5bn) in hydrocarbon revenues in 2012. Ralby said a huge industry was taking shape in which refined crude from Libya, which has Africa\u2019s largest oil reserves, was being illegally transferred ship-to-ship in the Mediterranean and passed off as legitimate oil imports to the EU. \u201cWe were somewhat surprised to see the extent of ongoing criminality within the EU. Many people believe this is [just] a developing state phenomenon,\u201d said Ralby. Part of the reason the crimes are not being tackled is that in many cases those who are meant to be stopping oil theft are sometimes involved \u2013 regulators can be perpetrators, and police can be facilitators. Another factor is that oil theft is sometimes seen as benign. \u201cIn some cases you have a Robin Hood dynamic. You have drug cartels stealing oil from a state-owned oil company and selling it at a discount to the poor. And in some cases, yes, you have criminality that aids the energy poor, but at what cost, at what consequence?\u201d said Ralby. That cost comes in direct economic losses to the energy industry and governments, the environmental impact of spilled oil and in the instability caused by oil money reaching terrorist groups and insurgents such as Nigeria\u2019s Niger Delta Avengers, according to the analysis. Ralby said there are affordable and easy \u201cquick wins\u201d to stem downstream oil theft. The Atlantic Council\u2019s Global Energy Center proposed molecular marking, where criminals cannot see that fuel is marked but authorities can test to see if it is illegitimate, and better tracking of oil tanker trucks. Separately on Tuesday, the credit rating agency Moody\u2019s said the oil price recovery in recent months had led it to upgrade the outlook for the major oil and gas companies from \u201cstable\u201d to \u201cpositive\u201d. It is the first time the majors have been classed as \u201cpositive\u201d since November 2014.",

      "bodyText": "Goldman Sachs is to start moving hundreds of staff out of London before a Brexit deal is struck, the bank\u2019s European boss has confirmed. Richard Gnodde, chief executive of Goldman Sachs International, said on Tuesday the decision to relocate workers was part of the bank\u2019s contingency plan for the UK leaving the EU. \u201cWe are going to start to execute those contingency plans\u201d, he told CNBC. Gnodde said the bank, which employs 6,000 staff in the capital, would take extra office space in Frankfurt and Paris. Speaking a week before Theresa May will formally being the UK\u2019s exit from the EU by triggering article 50, Gnodde said: \u201cWe start with a significant European footprint, we are licensed with banks in Germany and in France.\u201d \u201cOver the next 18 months or so we are going to upgrade those facilities, we\u2019ll be taking extra space in a number of them and be increasing our headcount and infrastructure around those facilities,\u201d said Gnodde. He said the numbers involved were \u201cin the hundreds of people as opposed to anything much greater than that\u201d and would also involve hiring people in the remaining 27 EU countries . Gnodde added that no final decisions had yet been made about how many staff would eventually work in which locations. \u201cThis is all in the context of contingency planning,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat our eventual footprint will look like will depend on the outcome of [the Brexit] negotiations and what we are obliged to do because of them.\u201d In January, the bank was the subject of speculation it could shift half of its 6,000-member workforce out of London, with 1,000 of the jobs relocated to Frankfurt. At the time Goldman said no decisions had been made. Goldman has about 200 staff in Frankfurt and 100 in Paris. He said: \u201cWhatever the outcome [of the Brexit talks], London will remain for us a very significant regional hub and a significant global hub. London will remain a very significant important centre.\u201d Other banks have also warned that roles will have to go as a result of Brexit. HSBCboss Stuart Gulliver has said 1,000 roles will move to Paris in about two years, when Brexit becomes effective. Swiss bank UBS has indicated that 1,000 of its 5,000 staff could shift, possibly to Frankfurt or Madrid. US bank JP Morgan hassaid 4,000 UK jobs are at risk. Estimates of the impact of Brexit on the City vary widely. Xavier Rolet, chief executive of the London Stock Exchange, has warned that 230,000 finance jobs could disappear while Mark Carney, governor of the bank of England, has played down the risks. He described the City as \u201cEurope\u2019s investment banker\u201d and said European economies could be damaged if their access was disrupted after Britain leaves the EU. Goldman Sachs\u2019 chief executive, Lloyd Blankfein, admitted in January that the bank was holding back from moving new activities into London, as had been previously planned. However, the bank is continuing to press on with building its new nine-storey London HQ, with the aim of moving in in 2019. The bank could take all the floors or subletto tenants.",

With Philip \u201cthe Undertaker\u201d Hammond still sulking about his budget and refusing to talk to anyone, it was left to Simon Kirby, the City minister who looks like a cross between Swiss Toni and Geert Wilders \u2013 though without the gravitas \u2013 to take the hit for the government. Kirby was on a warning. Having recently been relieved of any involvement in Brexit after everyone realised he was hopelessly out of his depth, the Treasury was conducting a process of elimination to discover if there was anything he could do well. On the basis of his answers to an urgent question from Labour on the Guardian\u2019s allegations about British banks processing billions of pounds of dirty Russian money, the answer might well be nothing. Kirby is a man who likes to keep his talents well hidden. \u201cWe want our financial institutions to lead the way in money laundering,\u201d Kirby announced, inadvertently sounding disappointed that our banks had yet to compete with Switzerland and the Cayman Islands for handling crime proceeds. \u201cWe will do what it takes,\u201d he continued, his finger moving over the relevant lines in the statement what he had wrote. The government was doing lots and lots. So much, that he couldn\u2019t quite remember any of it. The shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, began by accusing Kirby of complacency \u2013 this was harsh; Kirby might be stupid, but that doesn\u2019t necessarily make him complacent \u2013 before going on to point out that, of the banks implicated in the scandal, HSBC had form, RBS was three-quarters owned by the government and Barclays had been involved in Libor rigging. Was this not cause for concern about the stability of the financial system? Not really, shrugged Kirby. He was sure that the Financial Conduct Authority and the National Crime Agency were doing a fine job and if anyone was capable of sniffing out wrongdoing it was them. Besides which, he was in the process of consulting on something, though he couldn\u2019t say what as he would have to kill everyone if he did. But make no mistake, the something he would be consulting on would be a big step forward. Conservative David Nuttall tried to help the minister by pointing out that he had been made to fill in loads of money laundering forms to open a personal bank account. Good point, observed Kirby. It was precisely because the rules about money laundering were so comprehensive and complicated that the banks were struggling. What was needed was a relaxation of the laws. After that, the Labour benches went for Kirby. Angela Eagle said that he had no idea of the scale of the scandal while John Mann observed: \u201cYou appear to have been promoted beyond your competence.\u201d No one disagreed. Could the minister say which banks had been prosecuted for money laundering in the last five years and what he had learned from those judgments? Give me a break, Kirby pleaded. He had only heard about the Global Laundromat story that morning \u2013 and he hadn\u2019t got further than the first few paragraphs, as it was all terribly complicated. \u201cRight and proper,\u201d Kirby jabbered desperately. \u201cEverything is right and proper.\u201d Apart from the things that weren\u2019t right and proper, and he wouldn\u2019t rest until they were right and proper. Just please stop asking him difficult questions as he didn\u2019t know any of the answers. Could he say how many money launderers had been sent to prison in the past five years? No chance.

Thanks for reading the blog and for all the comments. We\u2019ll be back tomorrow. Monday\u2019s Eurogroup meeting of finance ministers ended without a decisive agreement between Greece and its creditors. The Guardian\u2019s Helena Smith brings this report: The Greek finance minister Euclid Tsakalotos has decided to stay on in Brussels in all out bid to come to some agreement on the festering issue of labour reforms, now seen as the central obstacle to finally ending the review. Many fear a repeat of the the summer of 2015 when Greece came closest yet to euro exit in the face of default. Athens owes hefty repayments of \u20ac7.4bn this July, mostly to the the European Central Bank - money it does not have. Greece is now under immense pressure to come to some deal with lenders but few believe it will be able to achieve this before May at the earliest, with Tsakalotos holding out for a comprehensive solution that will also include debt relief - something unlikely to be discussed before the International Monetary Fund\u2019s spring meeting at the end of April. The next few days could prove decisive, Greek government sources say. Meanwhile, banks are reporting that with the backdrop of uncertainty caused by the stalled review, bank deposits have fallen by \u20ac4bn since the end of 2016 - effectively wiping out the increase in deposits last year. The EU economic affairs commissioner, Pierre Moscovici, warned against further delays, describing them as \u201cvery harmful.\u201d \u201cThat would impair the confidence of investors and consumers,\u201d he said after the meeting. \u201cThat would be detrimental to economic recovery.\u201d The pound is still up 0.8% against the dollar at $1.2458. Meanwhile the euro is also having a good day, climbing to six-week highs of above $1.08 following the French presidential election debate, where the centrist Emmanuel Macron appeared to come out on top over the far-right\u2019s Marine Le Pen. Over in the US, markets have opened higher, tracking rises in Europe (with the exception of the FTSE) and higher oil prices. Dow Jones: +0.1% at 20,919 S&amp;P 500: +0.2% at 2,379 Nasdaq: +0.4% at 5,435 It\u2019s another record high for the Nasdaq, helped by Apple shares which are also at a record high, up 0.9% at $142.70 after the tech company released the latest version of the iPad. The Nasdaq\u2019s biggest risers: Pay packets in the UK are probably already shrinking according to the Resolution Foundation. Stephen Clarke, economic analyst at the thinktank, says: After 38 months inflation is back above the Bank\u2019s target, bringing to an end the era of ultra-low inflation that has boosted living standards in recent years. Today\u2019s rapid increase is part of a wider trend with price rises set to the big living standards story of this year. To date pay settlements have failed to respond to rapidly rising prices, meaning there\u2019s a good chance pay packets are already shrinking in real terms. While there is little that can be done to prevent oil price rises and a falling pound driving up inflation, today\u2019s figures reinforce the risks to living standards of weak wage rises, especially in the context of the recent slowdown in employment growth. February\u2019s inflation data was the first time the ONS focused on the CPIH measure of inflation, which is \u201cconsumer prices index including owner-occupiers\u2019 housing costs\u201d. As my colleague Katie Allen explains, this move is not without controversy: Some economists say CPIH is lacking as a measure because by using figures based on \u201crent equivalence\u201d, it does not truthfully capture people\u2019s experience of the housing market. CPIH lost its status as a \u201cnational statistic\u201d in 2014 and has yet to regain it. As it turns out, CPIH was 2.3% in February, the same level as the more traditional consumer prices index (CPI). The ONS says CPIH is the most comprehensive measure of inflation, but the fact remains it is not classed as a national statistic and the Bank of England continues to target CPI. Here in the UK, the big jump in inflation to 2.3% in February is in focus. Philip Shaw, economist at Investec, says the Bank of England is unlikely to raise interest rates until 2019, despite rising inflation: So far in 2017, CPI inflation is running ahead of the Bank of England\u2019s forecasts \u2013 February\u2019s outturn [of 2.3%] compares with a BoE projection of 2.1%. UK markets reacted sharply to today\u2019s data. Sterling rose to $1.2470, its highest level against the dollar since late-February. Interest rate markets sold off, but remain sceptical of a hike this year, and are not fully pricing in a tightening until the second half of 2018. We continue to believe that the first move will not occur until 2019, but figures on growth and pay will be as important as inflation in determining the timing. Ruth Gregory, UK economist at Capital Economics, says while there is no immediate pressure the Bank\u2019s Monetary Policy Committee to raise rates, that could change: The MPC looks likely to stand pat at least until 2018. But if the economy continues to hold up as well as we expect, interest rates could rise rather sooner than the markets have recently been anticipating. Time to take a look at the markets. The pound\u2019s gain is the FTSE 100\u2019s loss, as the modest gains made earlier have been erased. Here\u2019s how it looks: FTSE 100: -0.1% at 7,422 Germany\u2019s DAX: +0.2% at 12,076 France\u2019s CAC: +0.6% at 5,040 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB: +1.3% at 20,236 Spain\u2019s IBEX: +0.9% at 10,310 Europe\u2019s STOXX 600: +0.2% at 379 Wall Street is expected to open higher, tracking the broad gains in European markets. On a busy day for UK data, the CBI has got in on the act with its latest industrial trends survey. Manufacturers\u2019 expectations for growth were at the highest level in 22 years in March as export orders and output both rose at an accelerated rate. Anna Leach, head of economic intelligence at the CBI, said the drop in the value of the pound appears to be boosting to be exports: It\u2019s been a strong month for UK manufacturers, with production growing robustly and overseas demand on the up. The past fall in the pound seems finally to be helping lift demand for UK manufactured exports, which rose at one of the fastest paces in this survey\u2019s history. And manufacturers are positive about the quarter ahead, expecting output to grow at the fastest rate since February 1995. But the flipside is that cost pressures are widespread, and manufacturers expect factory-gate prices to continue to rise strongly over the next three months. And this will also put pressure on prices generally. Here\u2019s our full story on Mark Carney latest comments on the Charlotte Hogg debacle: Mark Carney was not amused when he was lobbed a question about today\u2019s inflation data during the Q&amp;A on banking standards. Asked what he made of the jump to 2.3% - a faster acceleration than the Bank expected - he answered rather abruptly that we shouldn\u2019t \u201coverreact to a single data point\u201d. The government borrowed \u00a31.8bn in February, \u00a32.8bn lower than a year earlier and the lowest amount for the month of February since 2007, before the financial crisis took hold. So the government is still spending more than it earns, but economists had forecast higher borrowing of \u00a32.1bn for last month. With just one month to go before the end of the fiscal year, borrowing totalled \u00a347.8bn - \u00a319.9bn less than at the same point last year. Tax receipts were strong last month, with income tax receipts up 13.3% and corporate tax receipts up 17.9%. That\u2019s good news for the chancellor, putting him firmly on track to meet the 2016-17 borrowing target of \u00a351.7bn. As Howard Archer points out, it\u2019s a boost for Philip Hammond after his national insurance U-turn shocker last week: Some much needed good news for chancellor Philip Hammond as the February public finance data (and an upwardly revised January surplus) put him on track to meet the markedly lowered 2016/17 fiscal target contained in March\u2019s budget. This is a particular relief for the chancellor as he has been under pressure after swiftly and embarrassingly scrapping his budget plans to raise national insurance contributions for the self-employed. The fiasco over the national insurance contributions for the self-employed means that the chancellor really could do with meeting his 2016/17 budget targets. Missing the 2016/17 budget deficit forecast contained in March\u2019s budget - even modestly - would be a further blow as he looks to regain credibility after the fiasco over the self-employed\u2019s national insurance contributions. Carney suggests he did not want Charlotte Hogg to resign: An honest mistake that is freely admitted for which a firm takes prompt remedial action is not a firing offence. He has given some some interesting details on the Bank\u2019s response to the revelation that Charlotte Hogg had broken Bank rules by failing to disclose her brother worked for Barclays (in a potential conflict of interest). He says: Hogg was \u201cformally warned in the strongest \u2013 and most public \u2013 of terms\u201d She waived her salary increase this year Hogg\u2019s responsibilities as chief operating officer were reassigned (she was originally going to stay on as COO as well as taking on the role of deputy governor for markets and banking) Reporting lines and internal structures have been changed to improve governance and disciplinary processes The Bank is undertaking a review following the incident and the results will be made public Bank of England governor Mark Carney is giving a speech on banking standards over at Threadneedle Street. He has taken the opportunity to address the issue of Charlotte Hogg - who resigned as deputy governor - less than two weeks after taking up the role - after failing to disclose her brother works for Barclays: Carney says the Bank understands it should be held up to the highest standards and accountability: For those who have questioned whether we \u201cget it\u201d, we do. We know this honest mistake was also a serious mistake \u2013 one that was compounded by the fact that Charlotte Hogg had overseen the development of our new code. We were clear upfront that there must be consequences for both her and the Bank. Here is a reminder of the story: UK inflation is on its way up...here\u2019s how it looks: Lots of reaction coming in to the inflation data but first a quick look at some of the detail from the ONS report. The main drivers of the sharper-than-expected rise in inflation were food and fuel prices. A sustained period of food deflation appears to be firmly over. Food prices increased by 0.3% in February compared with a year earlier, ending 31 consecutive months of falling prices. Over the month, food prices rose by 0.8% Fuel prices rose by 1.2% between January and February The price of computers (including laptops and tablets) rose 2.3% during the month Vegetables were major factor behind the rise in food prices, largely because of weather-related shortages in southern Europe. The price of an iceberg lettuce, for example, rose by 67% between January and February, having fallen 5.1% a year ago, The larger-than-expected rise in inflation to 2.3% in February further closes the gap between the rise in prices and wage growth. Inflation is now higher than wage growth (2.2% in the three months to January), signalling a return to falling real pay for UK workers. Frances O\u2019Grady, general secretary of the TUC, has commented on the inflation figures: Working people across the UK are now facing the double blow of rising prices and slower wage growth. If the government doesn\u2019t wake up, we risk sleepwalking into another living standards crisis. We urgently need more investment in skills and infrastructure to build strong foundations for better paid jobs. And it\u2019s time to scrap the pay restrictions hitting hardworking teachers, nurses and other public servants. The pound is up 0.8% against the dollar after the sharp jump in inflation, to $1.2455. Responding to the inflation figures, a spokesperson for the Treasury acknowledged that families are growing increasingly concerned about the rising cost of living. A strong economy and sustainable public finances are vital to achieve rising living standards. The spring budget set out plans to build a stronger, fairer economy by investing in skills, schools, social care and cutting-edge technology, while continuing to bring down the deficit and live within our means. The government appreciates that families are concerned about the cost of living, and that is why we are cutting tax for millions of working people, increasing the National Living Wage to \u00a37.50 per hour from next month, and freezing fuel duty for the seventh year in a row. Breaking: UK inflation rose to 2.3% in February from 1.8% in January. Food and fuel prices were the main drivers. It\u2019s a bigger-than-expected rise after economists forecast 2.1%, and the highest level since September 2013. Also a return to the Bank of England\u2019s 2% target. More soon... The pound is up 0.5% against the dollar, at $1.2412. The annual inflation rate is expected to rise to a three-year high of 2.1% in February from 1.8% in January, which in theory raises the prospect of an interest rate hike. In reality, economists expect Bank of England policymakers to keep rates on hold at an all-time low of 0.25% for the foreseeable future, as the Brexit road aheads remains hugely uncertain. Meanwhile the dollar index - which measures the performance of the US currency against other key currencies - fell below 100 for the first time since early February. Just five minutes to go until the inflation data... The UK house builder Bellway has warned on possible labour shortages after Brexit because the industry is so reliant on workers from abroad. It could exacerbate the housing shortage in the UK, according to the chief executive of the Newcastle-based builder. Speaking to the Guardian, Ted Ayres said: The big thing for construction industry is we have a reliance on overseas labour, and [the question is], will it have any impact on people not wanting to live in the UK or will it stop further people coming to the UK to help us meet the housing demand? We\u2019re not going to able to build the number of units completely off the UK workforce. He made the comments after Bellway posted a 9% rise in first half profits to \u00a3247m, pleasing investors and sending shares up 2.4% this morning. Neil Wilson, senior market analyst at ETX Capital, says house builders have been more resilient than expected since the Brexit vote. Shares in Bellway now stand above where they were before the Brexit vote. It\u2019s a far cry from June. To all those who bet against UK housebuilders in what was a bloodbath for the sector on June 24th [the day after the referendum], the last few months have been a lesson in fundamentals. The likes of Taylor Wimpey and Persimmon are also back to pre-referendum levels. Redrow has surged well past that level. Bovis is the laggard and left itself open to a takeover as a result. Part of it is down to the resilience of the UK economy and in particular the continued strength of consumer spending and confidence. The Bank of England played its part too in slashing interest rates to help boost confidence and ensure access to credit was not about to be a problem. This was an important signal at the time. Mortgage rates and availability remain very supportive. But the most important factor is the fundamental mismatch in the property sector between supply and demand, which across large parts of the country continues to exert upward pressure on selling prices faster than wages can keep pace. Europe\u2019s main indices are up this morning. The FTSE 100 is up by a modest 4 points at 7,433 as investors ponder Theresa May\u2019s decision to trigger Article 50 next Wednesday, formally kickstarting divorce proceedings with the EU. Markets have also shrugged of last night\u2019s presidential election debate in France, where the far-right Front National\u2019s Marine Le Pen came under fire from rivals. Here are the scores on the board: FTSE 100: +0.04% at 7,433 Germany\u2019s DAX: +0.1% at 12,070 France\u2019s CAC: +0.3% at 5,029 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB: +1% at 20,166 Spain\u2019s IBEX: +0.8% at 10,298 Europe\u2019s STOXX 600: +0.1% at 378 Also coming up today is UK public finances data for February, which will show how much the government borrowed over the month and reveal how the chancellor is doing as the fiscal year to the end of March 2017 draws to a close. In Philip Hammond\u2019s Spring budget earlier this month, the outlook for the public finances was revised to show lower borrowing over the coming years than previously expected - partly because economic growth has been more resilient. Borrowing in the full 2016-17 fiscal year is now expected to be \u00a351.7bn, after budget forecasts were revised down from \u00a368.2bn. That would be sharply lower than the \u00a376bn borrowed by the government in 2015-16. Here is our preview story on the UK inflation data, out at 9.30am: Traders at IG, the spread-betting firm, are expecting markets to be pretty subdued when trading gets underway in Europe this morning: Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. It\u2019s UK inflation day, and it is expected to a significant one. The consumer prices index has been rising since October and the latest data from the Office for National Statistics is expected to show a further rise in February to 2.1% from 1.8% in January. That would be the highest since November 2013 and mark a return to the Bank of England\u2019s 2% target after a prolonged period of below-target inflation. Brexit has put an end to the weak inflationary pressures of recent years, as the sharp drop in the value of the pound since the vote has pushed up the cost of imports from abroad and is starting to feed through to higher prices in the shops. Higher food and petrol prices are expected to contribute to the higher rate of inflation in February. Inflation is expected to rise to about 3% by the end of the year, putting increasing pressure on household finances at a time when wage growth is slowing. Higher inflation does not mean the Bank will raise interest rates any time soon though, as Philip Shaw from Investec explains: We still expect inflation to surpass 3% over the summer. But we do not expect the MPC to respond by raising rates unless there is a material acceleration in pay rates, a scenario which data earlier this week suggest is unlikely for now. The data is out at 9.30am.",

      "bodyText": "Independent and family-run businesses could be forced off London\u2019s high streets by the sharp rise in business rates that will come into force from April, spoiling the character of local communities, Sadiq Khan has warned. The mayor of London said businesses in the capital faced a \u201cclear and present risk\u201d from the tax and accused the government of not doing enough to help. Businesses in London will be hit with a tax increase of at least \u00a3900m a year due to a revaluation of rates, with firms facing a 45% rise in their tax bill, according to government data. \u201cThe very nature of London\u2019s high streets is under threat,\u201d Khan said. \u201cWhat we need is full devolution of business rates to London with genuine protections in place so we can safeguard businesses [that] are part of the fabric of what makes London such a vibrant, diverse and successful city.\u201d Philip Hammond, the chancellor, announced a \u00a3435m package of business rates relief in the budget. However, this is only a small proportion of the \u00a328.8bn the tax is expected to bring in for the Treasury this year. Hammond will hand \u00a3300m to local authorities over the next four years to offer discretionary discounts on business rates, but just \u00a372.5m of this will be available to London this year. Furthermore, Khan has estimated that at least 1,000 pubs in the capital will not be eligible for the \u00a31,000 business rates discount that Hammond also announced. Independent retailers are particularly at risk from the business rates revaluation because they will not be able to offset an increase in their business rates bill against decreases for shops in other parts of the country. London and Reading are the only cities in England and Wales that will face a rise in average business rates from the revaluation. This is the first time Britain\u2019s property has been revalued since 2010. The revaluation is designed to spread the burden of business rates according to economic prosperity. The amount of tax paid by business is calculated as a proportion of the value of their property and also takes into account the annual rate of inflation. Katrina Phillips, who runs an ethical interior design shop on Portobello Road in west London, said her business rates bill would increase by more than \u00a310,000 a year. \u201cWhen the new business rates were announced, without exaggeration, I thought I was going to have a heart attack. I literally could not breathe,\u201d she said. \u201cI have kept going through very tough times. I have strived to create a place of authenticity and beauty, something people are proud and relieved to be a part of. I will not be able to survive these increases. There is not enough money taken by small shops to bear these insane rents and rates.\u201d Noah Crutchfield, who owns three shops in Hackney, east London, said: \u201cThese increases will make it harder for small independent businesses in London to stay open, and many neighbouring businesses are already signalling they might have to shut.\u201d",

    "webTitle": "Rising food and fuel prices hoist UK inflation rate to 2.3%", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Rising food and fuel prices pushed Britain\u2019s inflation rate to 2.3% last month, the highest rate for more than three years. Inflation was well above the 2.1% expected in a Reuters poll of economists, as grocery bills started rising after years of food getting cheaper. The bigger-than-expected rise will intensify fears over people\u2019s living standards being squeezed this year by higher living costs. While inflation has been going up, wage growth has been slowing, leaving households worse off. The TUC said working people were facing the double blow of rising prices and slower wage growth. \u201cIf the government doesn\u2019t wake up, we risk sleepwalking into another living standards crisis,\u201d said the TUC general secretary, Frances O\u2019Grady. \u201cWe urgently need more investment in skills and infrastructure to build strong foundations for better-paid jobs. And it\u2019s time to scrap the pay restrictions hitting hardworking teachers, nurses and other public servants.\u201d The jump from 1.8% inflation in January to 2.3% in February took inflation above the Bank of England\u2019s 2% target and immediately raised expectations on financial markets that the Bank could raise interest rates sooner than previously thought to keep price rises in check. The pound strengthened against the dollar to hit a three-week high of $1.2462 after the inflation figures were released. Investors highlighted the significant pick-up in so-called core inflation, which excludes volatile prices such as food and fuel. That measure jumped to 2% in February from 1.6% in January and was well above forecasts of 1.8%. The Office for National Statistics said the main upward effect on inflation came from motor fuels as prices rose by 1.2% between January and February, reflecting recent increases in global oil prices as well as the pound\u2019s weakness since last June\u2019s referendum. The weaker pound makes imports to the UK, including oil, more expensive. The currency effect on inflation, combined with a rise in global oil prices, has brought a rude awakening for UK consumers, who had enjoyed near-zero inflation throughout 2015 and the first half of 2016. A number of companies, including food firms and the tech giant Apple, have announced price rises on the back of the weaker pound, which tumbled to three-decade lows after the Brexit vote. Reflecting those moves, the ONS said another factor in February\u2019s stronger inflation \u2013 the highest rate since September 2013 \u2013 was pricier laptops and tablets. They increased by 2.3% between January and February, having fallen by 5.1% a year ago. Food prices rose in annual terms for the first time in more than two-and-a-half years with a wide range of items contributing to the pick-up. There were particularly large price rises for certain vegetables, consistent with reports of poor growing conditions in southern Europe, the ONS said. For example, the price of an iceberg lettuce increased by 67.2% between January and February. The Treasury said the government understood the financial pressures on households. \u201cThe government appreciates that families are concerned about the cost of living, and that is why we are cutting tax for millions of working people, increasing the national living wage to \u00a37.50 per hour from next month, and freezing fuel duty for the seventh year in a row,\u201d a spokeswoman said. Economists expect inflation to rise further over coming months as the effects of the weak pound and higher oil prices continue to be felt. Some see inflation rising to 3% by the summer. The Bank\u2019s monetary policy committee (MPC), under the governor Mark Carney, has said it is happy to let inflation rise some way above its target as it balances the need to support growth and jobs with keeping price rises in check. But the minutes of its meeting last week suggested a split was emerging over how much inflation should be tolerated before taking borrowing costs higher again from their current record low of 0.25%. Kallum Pickering, an economist at the bank Berenberg, said the MPC\u2019s tolerance for rising inflation could be tested soon. \u201cAs our base case, we look for a 25 basis point first rate hike in the second quarter of 2018, with a 30% chance the BoE raises the bank rate earlier. After today\u2019s data release, risks to that call are skewed towards the BoE hiking sooner rather than later,\u201d he said. But James Smith, economist at the bank ING, said the squeeze on real incomes and the likely slowdown in consumer spending would deter the Bank from raising rates. \u201cWhilst this surge in inflation may raise a few eyebrows on the MPC, it\u2019s what this means for consumers that really counts,\u201d he said. \u201cWe suspect that concerns about surging inflation will be gradually outweighed by the slower growth backdrop. We don\u2019t expect any change in Bank rate before the end of 2018.\u201d The ONS also published figures on the public finances on Tuesday, showing chancellor Philip Hammond remained on track to cut the deficit this financial year. Strong tax receipts helped cut public sector net borrowing to \u00a31.8bn in February 2017, down by \u00a32.8bn from February 2016. It was the lowest February borrowing since 2007. With one month left to go, borrowing for the financial year so far was \u00a347.8bn. The fiscal watchdog, the Office for Budget Responsibility, forecasts a\u00a351.7bn deficit for the whole financial year compared with the previous year\u2019s \u00a372bn.",

The weaker pound makes imports to the UK, including oil, more expensive.</p> <p>The currency effect on inflation, combined with a rise in global oil prices, has brought a rude awakening for UK consumers, who had enjoyed near-zero inflation throughout 2015 and the first half of 2016. A number of companies, including food firms and the tech giant Apple, have announced price rises on the back of the weaker pound, which tumbled to three-decade lows after the Brexit vote.</p> <p>Reflecting those moves, the ONS said another factor in February\u2019s stronger inflation \u2013 the highest rate since September 2013 \u2013 was pricier laptops and tablets. They increased by 2.3% between January and February, having fallen by 5.1% a year ago. </p> <p>Food prices rose in annual terms for the first time in more than two-and-a-half years with a wide range of items contributing to the pick-up. There were particularly large price rises for certain vegetables, consistent with reports of poor growing conditions in southern Europe, the ONS said. For example, the price of an iceberg lettuce increased by 67.2% between January and February.</p> <p>The Treasury said the government understood the financial pressures on households.</p> <p>\u201cThe government appreciates that families are concerned about the cost of living, and that is why we are cutting tax for millions of working people, increasing the national living wage to \u00a37.50 per hour from next month, and freezing fuel duty for the seventh year in a row,\u201d a spokeswoman said.</p> <p>Economists expect inflation to rise further over coming months as the effects of the weak pound and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/dec/12/oil-price-surges-opec-non-opec-agree-deal-cut-output\">higher oil prices</a> continue to be felt. Some see inflation rising to 3% by the summer.<br></p> <p>The Bank\u2019s monetary policy committee (MPC), under the governor Mark Carney, has said it is happy to let inflation rise some way above its target as it balances the need to support growth and jobs with keeping price rises in check. But the minutes of its meeting last week suggested <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/mar/16/bank-of-england-uk-interest-rates-monetary-policy-committee\">a split was emerging over how much inflation should be tolerated before taking borrowing costs higher again</a> from their current record low of 0.25%.</p> <p>Kallum Pickering, an economist at the bank Berenberg, said the MPC\u2019s tolerance for rising inflation could be tested soon.</p> <p>\u201cAs our base case, we look for a 25 basis point first rate hike in the second quarter of 2018, with a 30% chance the BoE raises the bank rate earlier. After today\u2019s data release, risks to that call are skewed towards the BoE hiking sooner rather than later,\u201d he said.</p> <p>But James Smith, economist at the bank ING, said the squeeze on real incomes and the likely slowdown in consumer spending would deter the Bank from raising rates. <br></p> <p>\u201cWhilst this surge in inflation may raise a few eyebrows on the MPC, it\u2019s what this means for consumers that really counts,\u201d he said. </p> <p>\u201cWe suspect that concerns about surging inflation will be gradually outweighed by the slower growth backdrop. We don\u2019t expect any change in Bank rate before the end of 2018.\u201d<br></p> <p>The ONS also published <a href=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/governmentpublicsectorandtaxes/publicsectorfinance/bulletins/publicsectorfinances/feb2017\">figures on the public finances</a> on Tuesday, showing chancellor Philip Hammond remained on track to cut the deficit this financial year. </p> <p>Strong tax receipts helped cut public sector net borrowing to \u00a31.8bn in February 2017, down by \u00a32.8bn from February 2016. It was the lowest February borrowing since 2007. With one month left to go, borrowing for the financial year so far was \u00a347.8bn. The fiscal watchdog, the Office for Budget Responsibility, forecasts a\u00a351.7bn deficit for the whole financial year compared with the previous year\u2019s \u00a372bn.</p>",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Sir Philip Green is in line for a \u00a315m refund from his \u00a3363m deal to rescue the BHS pensions scheme, Labour MP Frank Field has claimed. Green could get the money back despite BHS workers receiving on average just 88% of the value of their original benefits from the settlement. Field, who co-led the parliamentary investigation into the collapse of the retailer, called on the billionaire tycoon to hand the \u00a315m to BHS pensioners to make up for the shortfall in their benefits. The Pensions Regulator and Green announced they had reached a settlement over the BHS pensions scandal last month. The \u00a3363m payment from Green included \u00a320m towards the cost of setting up a new pension scheme for former BHS workers. However, under the terms of the agreement \u00a315m of this could be returned to the tycoon if 90% of eligible workers chose to receive their benefits as a lump-sum payment rather than entering the new pension scheme or remaining in the old one. Field said that estimates by Green\u2019s advisers when he had looked at a rescue deal for the pension scheme when he still owned BHS estimated that 90% of workers would take the lump sum. Furthermore, the Labour MP claimed that the senior BHS managers who worked closest to Green will do the best from the settlement. While workers will receive 88% of their benefits on average, Field said there was a \u201cgreat deal of variation\u201d, with 26 members of the pension scheme receiving less than 80% and 1,481 collecting between 95% and 100%. Field said that the former BHS workers who will do best are 16 higher paid people whose benefits would have been capped if the pension scheme had entered the Pension Protection Fund, a lifeboat for failed schemes. The PPF caps pay-outs at \u00a337,420.42 a year \u201cI hope Sir Philip will recycle any refund back into the scheme as BHS pensioners will still be facing cuts in the benefits for which they paid,\u201d Field said. \u201cIt is also clear that Sir Philip prioritised his loyal senior managers, who have had the PPF cap on high pension benefits completely removed. \u201cThat measure was designed to encourage those in positions of influence to urge prudence and responsibility. I would be worried if TPR [the pension regulator] was content to see it jettisoned as a matter of course. Those who do far less well out of the settlement are the ordinary staff of working age, many of whom lost will have lost their jobs as well.\u201d Green declined to comment, although sources close to the former BHS owner pointed out that money should not be classed as a refund because the \u00a320n was provided as a contingency in case it was needed. The pension settlement was agreed with the regulator, the PPF and the BHS trustees, they added. The collapse of BHS last year led to the loss of 11,000 jobs and left a \u00a3571m pension deficit. Green owned BHS for 15 years until he sold it to Dominic Chappell, a former bankrupt with no retail experience, for just \u00a31 in March 2015. During his ownership, the Green family and other shareholders collected at least \u00a3580m from BHS in dividends, rental payments and interest on loans. BHS fell into administration just 13 months after Green sold it. A high-profile parliamentary investigation into the demise of BHS, led by Field and fellow Labour MP Iain Wright, concluded that the company had been systematically plundered by its owners and described the hole in the pension fund as \u201cthe unacceptable face of capitalism\u201d. Green initially pledged to \u201csort\u201d the problems facing the BHS pension scheme last June when he was questioned by MPs as part of the parliamentary investigation. MPs later voted in favour of stripping Green of his knighthood during a heated debate about his honour The Pensions Regulator started legal action against Green last year in an attempt to force him to contribute cash to the pension scheme. This enforcement action has halted after the settlement was announced last month, but legal proceedings are continuing against Chappell and his company, Retail Acquisitions, which acquired BHS from Green. Chappell has pledged to fight the legal action against him, saying the black hole in the BHS pension scheme was not his fault. Retail Acquisitions received payments of up to \u00a325m from BHS despite owning the department store chain for just 13 months until it collapsed. The regulator is understood to be seeking a similar amount from Chappell and his company.",
