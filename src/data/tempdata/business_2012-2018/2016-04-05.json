      "bodyText": "Consumers have benefited from three years of continuously falling shop prices on non-food goods, according to the latest data from retailers. Excluding food, prices fell 2.6% in March from a year earlier, according to the BRC-Nielsen shop price index. It was a slower rate of annual deflation than February, when non-food prices fell by 3%, but it was the 36th month of consecutive falls as consumers continue to shop around for bargains. Helen Dickinson, chief executive of the British Retail Consortium, said: \u201cDespite consumer confidence remaining at zero, a relatively benign economic environment and a fiercely competitive market will see retailers continue to respond to their customers with prices and promotions to maintain market share as the spring season kicks off.\u201d Deflation deepened in footwear, men\u2019s clothing, children\u2019s clothing and babywear, as well as furniture and carpets. Annual food deflation was 0.4% in March, unchanged from February. Fresh food was the driver of the price falls, with the cost of fruit, milk, cheese, eggs, meat, vegetables and oils and fats all lower than a year earlier. Ambient food prices rose, driven higher by bread, cereals and alcohol. Mike Watkins, head of retail and business insight at Nielsen, said: \u201cShoppers are still making changes to how they spend to stay within their household budget and looking out for price cuts and promotions is one of the ways to save money. \u201cSo with shop prices continuing to be lower than a year ago this is good news for shoppers. With spring arriving, retailers will be hoping that this drives store traffic, as so far this year retail sales have been rather unpredictable.\u201d Overall shop prices \u2013 including both food and non-food \u2013 fell by 1.7% in March compared with a year earlier. That was a slower rate of deflation than February when annual prices were down 2%. Falling shop prices reflect weak inflation in the wider UK economy. Annual inflation was 0.3% in February according to the Office for National Statistics, unchanged from January.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Stock markets across Europe have fallen following weaker than expected economic indicators, falling oil prices, and a warning from the International Monetary Fund stoked fears of a slowing global recovery. All major European markets fell, with the FTSE 100 in London closing down 1.2% or 73 points at 6091.23, after new data indicated global economic uncertainty and concern over the EU referendum weighed on Britain\u2019s services sector in March, in the latest sign that the UK recovery is losing momentum. The German Dax was the biggest faller of the major European stock markets, down 2.6%, after factory orders fell unexpectedly as a result of weaker foreign demand. German industrial orders declined 1.2% in February, well below expectations of a 0.2% rise in Europe\u2019s largest economy, the biggest monthly fall in six months. Stefan Schilbe, economist at HSBC, said the fall \u201cclearly shows that the weak global environment is taking its toll\u201d. The fragile state of the global economy was further highlighted by falling oil prices \u2013 Brent crude at one point hit a one-month low of $37.27 a barrel \u2013 and a warning from the head of the IMF, Christine Lagarde, who said in a lecture in Germany that growth was \u201ctoo slow, too fragile, and risks to its durability are increasing\u201d. European shares slipped to a six-week low. The FTSEurofirst 300 \u2013 featuring Europe\u2019s largest companies \u2013 fell 1.9% to its lowest level since 25 February. The French CAC fell 2.2% and the Spanish Ibex was down 2.4% as investors around Europe were left disappointed by data from the eurozone services sector. Growth in the sector slowed in March according to the Markit PMI survey, and was revised down from an earlier estimate. The headline index fell to a 14-month low of 53.1 last month from 53.3 in February, where anything above 50 indicates growth. Howard Archer, chief European and UK economist at IHS Global Insight, said: \u201cThis is a setback to hopes that the eurozone economy may just be starting to improve after a dreary start to 2016. \u201cGlobal economic uncertainties and problems have clearly hampered eurozone growth so far in 2016 not only through limiting exports but also through weighing down appreciably on business and consumer confidence, which has negative implications for employment, investment and consumption decisions.\u201d In the UK, a closely watched survey of the dominant services sector suggested that progress came to a virtual standstill last month as companies weighed up a combination of risks, including the looming possibility of an exit from the EU. The sector, which includes restaurants, bars and hotels, experienced the weakest quarter in three years during the first three months of the year, according to the Markit/Cips PMI index. James Knightley, a senior global economist at ING, said concerns over the possibility of Britain leaving the EU were weighing heavily on the services sector, which accounts for about three-quarters of the UK economy. \u201cWith opinion polls suggesting that the vote will be incredibly close, businesses are likely to act cautiously and not embark on any significant expansion plans until the economic outlook is clearer,\u201d he said. \u201cThis means that investment and labour hiring plans will be more limited.\u201d The March UK services PMI was the latest indication that economic growth has slowed since the beginning of the year. Chris Williamson, the chief economist at Markit, said that along with equivalent surveys for the manufacturing and construction sectors, the report suggested the economy grew by 0.4% in the first quarter, compared with 0.6% in the fourth quarter of 2015. \u201cBusiness confidence remains in the doldrums as concerns about the global economy continue to be exacerbated by uncertainty at home, with nerves unsettled by issues such as Brexit and the prospect of further government spending cuts announced in the budget,\u201d he said. The report showed a slight improvement in overall activity in March. The headline index edged up to 53.7, from 52.7 in February. Any figure above 50 indicates expansion. However, confidence among companies operating in the sector dipped and new business growth slowed. Williamson said growth was likely to slow further. \u201cIt seems unlikely that March\u2019s upturn in the pace of growth represents the start of a longer term upswing,\u201d he said. \u201cIn contrast, the survey data suggest growth is more likely to weaken further in the second quarter.\u201d Williamson said the prospect of a rise in UK interest rates seemed \u201ca long way off\u201d. The Bank of England has held rates at 0.5% since March 2009. In better news for the eurozone, retail sales increased unexpectedly in February, by 0.2% compared with January. Growing demand in France and Spain helped offset a fall in Germany, according to the EU statistics office Eurostat.",

      "bodyText": "Where once there was torpor, now there is hyperactivity. A government that a week ago seemed to be washing its hands of the steel industry in accordance with pure free market dogma is now rushing around trying to find a buyer for Tata Steel\u2019s UK operations. Clearly, the days are over when Anna Soubry, the No2 at the business department, was seen as the right minister to field questions about the future of Port Talbot on BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme. The crisis is now also above the pay grade of Soubry\u2019s somewhat chastened boss, Sajid Javid. David Cameron himself has taken charge. Hyperactivity should not, of course, be confused with sensible policy action and there is a danger that a government in headless-chicken mode could be just as dangerous as a government in laissez-faire mode. There are clearly reasons for quick and decisive action. Tata is leaking cash and the prime minister is leaking support. The crisis has been a gift to those campaigning for a no vote in the EU referendum, which is now only two and a half months away. But that does not mean that ministers should accept the first buyer who comes along. Trade unions are rightly deeply sceptical about a takeover by Sanjeev Gupta\u2019s Liberty House commodities group, since it would involve the closure of the blast furnace at Port Talbot, with long-term implications for the UK steel industry. If a decent offer does not come along, ministers could do worse than to look at the suggestion made by David Bailey, of Aston Business School and Paul Forrest, of Birmingham City University. That would be to take Tata Steel into \u201cconservatorship\u201d, the model used in the US to bring back to health strategically significant businesses that have run into short-term difficulties but are seen as having long-term viability. Conservatorship involves the state taking responsibility for the debt and daily running costs of a troubled company but allowing day-to-day operations to continue under the existing corporate structure. Bailey and Forrest believe this would provide enough breathing space to take action in the five areas that would help steel through its current problems: energy costs; EU emissions regulations; procurement; business rates; and unfair dumping by China. This approach carries none of the ideological baggage of full nationalisation but would increase the chances of a sale, a management buyout or a public-private joint venture that would better safeguard the future of the industry in Britain. This is a time for cool heads and long-term thinking. Under pressure though the government is, ministers should not assume that the only choice is between a bad deal and no deal. Categorically, that is not the case.",

Bailey and Forrest believe this would provide enough breathing space to take action in the five areas that would help steel through its current problems: <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/apr/03/uk-steel-industry-saved-tata\">energy costs; EU emissions regulations; procurement; business rates; and unfair dumping by China</a>.</p> <p>This approach carries none of the ideological baggage of full nationalisation but would increase the chances of a sale, a management buyout or a public-private joint venture that would better safeguard the future of the industry in Britain. This is a time for cool heads and long-term thinking. Under pressure though the government is, ministers should not assume that the only choice is between a bad deal and no deal. Categorically, that is not the case.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Five former Barclays bankers accused of conspiring to rig Libor interest rates were \u201cdriven by money\u201d and their offence \u201cis no different from stealing,\u201d a court has been told. Jonathan James Mathew, 35; Stylianos Contogoulas, 44; Jay Vijay Merchant, 45; Alex Pabon, 37; and Ryan Michael Reich, 34, are accused of manipulating the US dollar Libor, or London interbank offered rate between 1 June 2005 and 1 September 2007. They all deny one count of conspiracy to defraud. UK and US regulators fined Barclays \u00a3290m in 2012 for manipulating Libor, which prompted the UK\u2019s Serious Fraud Office (SFO) to launch an investigation. Libor is a crucial financial benchmark that determines the cost of borrowing on mortgages and loans for households and companies. The SFO claims the five men \u201cdishonestly agreed to procure or make submissions of rates by Barclays, a panel bank, into the dollar Libor setting process which were false or misleading\u201d. Opening the case against the bankers at Southwark crown court in London, the prosecutor James Hines QC said: \u201cThis is a fraud case. The defendants were employees of Barclays Bank and the prosecution case is that they conspired to defraud the people with whom they trade by dishonestly rigging the Libor rate.\u201d He explained that Libor, the interest rate at which major banks borrow money from each other, is calculated and published shortly before midday every day. Billions of trades in the financial world are conducted daily on the basis of it. \u201cSo this case is about employees of Barclays Bank rigging, for their own advantage, what is in fact a global benchmark interest rate. In doing so they were driven by money ... to make more profit on their trading. \u201cIt is clear that the purpose of the agreement was specifically to prejudice the economic interest of the other parties \u2026 those parties were to lose out financially and economically. It really is no different from stealing.\u201d Hines stressed that the losses involved were \u201cnot simply paper losses\u201d but \u201creal money\u201d, adding that the dollar Libor rate affected deals worth more than $300tn (\u00a3212tn) . The court heard that the Libor system was operated by the British Bankers\u2019 Association and was not subject to a regulator. Hines said: \u201cIf Libor is to be used effectively as a benchmark \u2026 it absolutely must be trusted by the industry. Without credibility and integrity the financial world simply wouldn\u2019t use it.\u201d The jury was told Barclays was one of 16 banks on a panel that set Libor each day, and that Mathew and his co-conspirator Peter Johnson were responsible for submitting the Barclays rate. Hines said that four derivatives traders \u2013 Merchant, Pabon and Reich, based in New York, and Contogoulas in London \u2013 told Mathew and Johnson, also in London, whether they wanted the rate to go up or down, and the pair then tried to do their best to ensure this happened. The jury heard that in one conversation requesting a low rate submission, Contogoulas joked: \u201cAlso, can you please tell me what next week\u2019s lottery numbers are? I would appreciate it.\u201d Another message exchange read: \u201cWe just need to f****** smash it. Have him set it low\u201d.",

The trading update on the investment operation was contained in a circular being sent to shareholders before the bank\u2019s annual general meeting on 28 April. It intends to call a general meeting immediately after the AGM to facilitate the African sell-off. The Barclays chief executive, Jes Staley, last month told investors he intended to scale back in Africa as he cut the dividend payout by more than 50% for the coming two years. The bank, which admitted last month that profits in the investment banking arm would be down, blamed current market conditions and a particularly strong performance a year ago. \u201cIn Barclays\u2019 investment banking operations, income in January and February was broadly in line with the same period last year. However, in light of current market conditions for investment banking and on the back of a particularly strong March in 2015, the board of Barclays does not expect as strong a performance from its investment banking operations for the whole of [the first quarter] of this year,\u201d Barclays said. Staley wants to reduce the bank\u2019s 62% stake in its African operations, which are listed on the Johannesburg stock exchange, over the next two to three years. Former Barclays boss Bob Diamond has been mooted as a possible buyer, though in the circular to shareholders Barclays said the \u201ccurrent intention of the board is to retain a meaningful stake in Barclays Africa\u201d. It wants to reduce its shareholding to below 20% so it can remove the operation from the wider group. Barclays listed a number of reasons for selling the business, which boasts assets of \u00a350bn and made profits last year of \u00a31.1bn, including reducing the need to hold capital against the operation. It cited \u201cstringent UK and US conduct and other regulatory standards which are required to be applied to Barclays Africa\u2019s business in addition to those standards that might otherwise apply to the Barclays Africa Group\u201d. These include EU, UK and US economic sanctions and financial crime rules. The circular refers to a number of legal matters facing the African operations including those at Absa, its South African operation, which has admitted it has \u201cidentified potentially fraudulent activity by certain of its customers using import advance payments to effect foreign exchange transfers from South Africa to beneficiary accounts located in Asia, UK, Europe and the USA\u201d. It disclosed that Barclays could be required to pay compensation \u2013 yet to be calculated \u2013 to the African business for ending services such as credit risk, support services, human resources and technology services. Barclays can renegotiate the use of its name in countries such as Botswana, Ghana and Mauritius, if its ownership falls below 35%. Barclays said it had hired its own investment banking arm as well as bankers from Citigroup and JP Morgan Cazenove to advise on the disposal of part or all of the African operation.",

      "bodyText": "The business secretary said he wants Tata to agree a process for selling its UK steel business when they meet in Mumbai on Wednesday. Sajid Javid hinted at the financial support that ministers would be willing to provide to secure a sale of Tata\u2019s British assets, saying he wants potential buyers to understand that the UK government would have a role if the CEO, Cyrus Mistry, pushed for a sale. Javid also revealed that Liberty House \u2013 owned by Sanjeev Gupta \u2013 is not the only company to show interest. \u201cIt\u2019s great that this interest is out there,\u201d he said. The government is also thought to have contacted investment firm Greybull and ThyssenKrupp, the German industrial conglomerate. About 40,000 jobs are at risk after Tata announced last week it would sell its UK steel business, including the blast furnaces at Port Talbot, the biggest steelworks in the country. The business secretary said meetings on Tuesday with David Cameron and the Welsh first minister, Carwyn Jones, had been constructive. Javid is holding meetings with the Welsh government, trade unions, and Liberty House before flying to Mumbai to meet Tata. \u201cI\u2019ve met Liberty before and I\u2019m very happy to meet them again [on Tuesday],\u201d Javid said. \u201cI\u2019m looking forward to that. But it\u2019s right that there is a role here for the UK government and I\u2019ve set out how we can help. There\u2019s a lot of detail there to work out and of course it depends on who the buyer is. \u201cBut the important thing is, where the buyers are coming forward we\u2019re ready to work with them.\u201d The Welsh first minister said his message to Cameron at the meeting, which was also attended by Javid and George Osborne, had been: \u201cThese plants cannot close.\u201d Jones told the Guardian that pulling out of the European Union would result in high tariffs on British steel and would \u201cfurther undermine\u201d the country\u2019s steel industry. He said that in their talks Cameron had told him that the UK government was prepared to step in to help the sale of Tata\u2019s assets. Jones said the prime minister \u201crecognised that work needs to be done on pension liability, on increasing tariffs and high energy prices\u201d. He also said ministers had admitted that losing the steel industry would be a security threat because of the need to produce equipment for the military. \u201cThere will need to be action from the UK government in order to make a sale more attractive. We were surprised by the timescale of weeks,\u201d added Jones. \u201cTata have confirmed that all their assets will be in a saleable position. I don\u2019t think they will want to surrender that reputation for corporate social responsibility.\u201d On Europe, he added: \u201cWhat we do know is that if we weren\u2019t in the EU we\u2019d have enormous tariffs on British steel. We wouldn\u2019t be able to compete with steel producers outside Europe. If there were any barriers to that market [it would] undermine the steel industry further.\u201d It would be \u201cfinancially daft\u201d to pull out of the EU and expect it to help the industry, Jones said. Speaking before a meeting with Javid, Gupta said the biggest obstacle to reviving the lossmaking business was the giant blast furnace at Port Talbot. But he suggested it could be possible to switch to arc furnaces to recycle scrap steel instead of importing raw materials and then exporting scrap. Asked if he thought the business could be overhauled without job losses, Gupta said: \u201cYes, absolutely, that would be my intention.\u201d Liberty House already owns steel plants in the UK, including in south Wales, and has been taking on assets affected by the crisis in the steel industry. It reopened a steel mill in Newport, south Wales, last year after spending two years reviving the site. Last month, Gupta also bought two mills in Scotland that had belonged to Tata Steel. Gupta told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme that he believed 2,000 of Port Talbot\u2019s workers employed at the blast furnace could be redeployed within the business. He has argued for some time that British steel\u2019s future lies in recycling scrap rather than importing slabs to be melted down. However, Gupta warned that it was early days and that his company had not had the chance to inspect Tata Steel\u2019s business or talk to the company or the government. \u201cWhat anybody looking at this prospect must contend with is: \u2018What is the main problem of the viability of this business?\u2019 The main problem we see is the blast furnace, because they are importing all their own materials \u2026 It will take years to make this transition from blast furnaces to arc furnaces, but there has to be a long-term plan.\u201d Gupta said Tata Steel\u2019s pension fund, with 130,000 members and liabilities of almost \u00a315bn, was another obstacle. He declined to say whether Liberty House would buy Tata Steel\u2019s UK business if the pension fund were split off. \u201cIt is certainly an issue that has to be tackled, but for us the focus is the absolute viability of the plant first,\u201d he said.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Zero-hours contracts make it harder for workers to save and present a challenge to financial institutions to come up with products suitable for consumers on less secure incomes, the City regulator has said. The number of workers on zero-hours contracts, which do not offer a minimum number of hours a week, surpassed 800,000 for the first time in the last three months of 2015. This represents about 2.1% of the UK workforce, according to the Office for National Statistics. In its annual business plan, the Financial Conduct Authority highlighted the way in which employment patterns and the makeup of the workforce have changed, with an increase in self-employment, part-time work and temporary workers since the onset of the financial crisis in 2008. \u201cThere also appears to have been a rise in the number of people employed on \u2018zero-hours contracts\u2019 in recent years,\u201d the FCA said. \u201cThese kinds of employment forms may involve less secure contracts and in some cases may make it harder for consumers to plan and save. This is likely to change the products and services consumers seek to fit their new income patterns.\u201d Zero hours contracts mean that individuals do not have guaranteed incomes and are more likely to be offered to young and part-time workers, women and those in full-time education. The FCA said slow wage rises meant that people could become more reliant on debt. \u201cUnsustainable levels of debt will make consumers more vulnerable in the event of a shock such as a reduction in income,\u201d the regulator said. \u201cThis could quickly lead to them defaulting on their debt. It could also impact their long-term ability to access financial services products, or limit their credit options.\u201d It added that rules to ringfence high street operations from risker investment banking could lead to more expensive mortgages. \u201cThe move to ringfence retail banks may, over the medium to long term, impact the use of securitisation and thus increase funding costs. These factors could therefore give rise to risks to consumers from the reduced availability, or increased expense, of mortgage credit,\u201d the FCA said. The authority said it was considering the consequences of a possible vote to leave the EU in the referendum on 23 June. \u201cThis includes considering the immediate and short-term consequences of any vote to leave the EU, such as the potential for increased market volatility,\u201d it said. The body, set up by the Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition government to replace the Financial Services Authority, set out seven priorities for the new financial year to March 2017. It will focus on: pensions; financial crime and preventing money laundering; wholesale financial markets; advice; innovation and technology; company culture and governance; and the treatment of existing customers. Last year, the FCA faced protests after it dropped a formal review of culture in the banking sector, which it had promised to undertake in the business review last year. While the regulator did not pledge to renew that study, the FCA\u2019s chairman, John Griffith-Jones, said: \u201cWe identify firms\u2019 culture and governance as one of our seven priorities because experience has demonstrated that poor culture and poor conduct are closely related. It is vital therefore that industry continues to work to deliver its own cultural change, thereby reducing regulatory infringements.\u201d In this year\u2019s business plan, it promised to undertake a formal study of people\u2019s prospects in retirement and develop policy to extend the senior managers and certification regime \u2013 the new rules designed to hold senior bankers to account \u2013 to all financial companies that the FCA regulates by 2018. The plan was unveiled by the FCA\u2019s acting chief executive, Tracey McDermott, who pulled out of the race for the top job, which will be filled by the deputy governor of the Bank of England, Andrew Bailey, in July.",

But the new business index hit its lowest level since the survey began in October 2009. \uf0a7 Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit said: The welcome news of sustained robust hiring in March, as indicated by both the PMI surveys and non-farm payroll numbers, masks a more worrying picture of a further slowing in economic growth so far this year. The survey data, which have historically provided a reliable guide to official GDP numbers, suggest the annualized pace of economic growth weakened to 0.7% in the first quarter. Demand is growing at the slowest rate since late- 2009 and, with business optimism also sliding to its weakest since the recession, firms clearly expect worse to come. Firms are worried about a potential weakening of demand both at home and abroad in the face of various headwinds. As such, the data support the cautious approach to policy tightening currently advocated by Fed Chair Janet Yellen. On that note, it\u2019s time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll back tomorrow. The combination of volatile oil prices, the IMF warning of risks to the global economy, and a spate of uninspiring economic data has seen Wall Street follow other markets into the red. On top of all that, there is the added wrinkle of uncertainty over the path of US interest rates, ahead of Wednesday\u2019s release of the minutes from the March Federal Reserve meeting. So the Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 105 points or 0.5%, while the S&amp;P 500 is down 0.4% and Nasdaq 0.7% at the open. In Europe, Germany\u2019s Dax is down 2.5% and France\u2019s Cac has fallen 2.3%. Meanwhile the FTSE 100 is currently down 1.1%. America\u2019s trade deficit widened by more than expected in February, up 2.6% to $47.1bn rather than the $46.2bn forecast by analysts. An revival in exports was offset by an increase in imports, making the deficit the highest since August. With the yen at a 17 month high against the dollar despite Japan\u2019s negative interest rates, it is no surprise there have been suggestions the country\u2019s central bank could be prepared to act again. Now Reuters is reporting that it will consider further measures at its meeting this month: Bank of Japan policymakers will likely debate the possibility of easing monetary policy further at a rate review this month, as a raft of gloomy data threatens their scenario that a moderate economic recovery will accelerate inflation towards a 2 percent target, sources familiar with their thinking said. If the central bank were to act, it would more likely increase asset purchases than cut interest rates, the sources said, as financial institutions are still scrambling to adjust to a negative rate policy deployed in January. But a decision on whether to ease at the April 27-28 review will be a close call as many BOJ officials are wary of using their limited policy tools again so soon, especially as the negative rate move has proved unpopular among the public. \u201cIt will be a question of whether the BOJ feels it has forestalled risks in January or whether they feel that January\u2019s action wasn\u2019t enough,\u201d said one of the people familiar with the BOJ\u2019s thinking. The BOJ stunned markets in January by adding negative interest rates to its massive asset-buying programme, dubbed \u201cquantitative and qualitative easing,\u201d to forestall the risk of external headwinds derailing a fragile economic recovery. But the move failed to boost stock prices or arrest an unwelcome yen rise, drawing criticism from lawmakers and investors as confusing rather than calming markets. The latest warning from the IMF follows a familiar pattern, but the fund has to do more than just talk, says Larry Elliott. It needs to act as well. His full analysis is here: Britain could enter a recession at the end of 2016 if it votes to leave the European Union, according to strategists at Aviva Investors. They said: Aviva Investors believes that if the UK were to vote to leave the EU, there would be a significant and negative knock-on effect on business sentiment, which would likely push the UK economy into recession towards the end of this year. The consequences of a vote to leave wouldn\u2019t just be felt temporarily. There would likely be a permanent reduction in exports to the EU, while foreign-direct investment into the UK would also suffer, leading to higher unemployment and a decline in the country\u2019s long-term growth potential. Furthermore, negotiations to leave would be complex and difficult. EU leaders would not be expected to give the UK an easy ride for fear of encouraging others to follow. Looking further ahead, the likely reduction in exports to the EU could reduce national income by three per cent, rising to as much as ten per cent in a worst-case scenario. Finally, the long-term growth potential of the UK could also be negatively impacted by, amongst other things, lower foreign direct investment. While any estimate of that effect is highly speculative, it could potentially shave 0.2-0.4 percentage points off growth. Financial markets would undoubtedly react badly to a vote in favour of \u2018Brexit\u2019 too. Aviva Investors would expect an immediate and sharp fall in the pound. The UK runs comparatively large fiscal and current account deficits, and as such relies on foreign capital to finance the deficiency in domestic saving. If, as anticipated, the uncertainty created by a vote to leave causes international investors to re-appraise their appetite for sterling assets, the decline in the pound could become more severe over time. While the Bank of England would no doubt ease policy in response to any economic downturn, it seems unlikely this would prevent UK share prices from falling sharply. In particular, shares in smaller companies, which tend to rely more on the domestic economy, would probably underperform. The impact on gilts is less clear. They may benefit from some domestic safe-haven flows, but at the same time, many international investors will be looking to sell. The continuing slide in crude prices follows the growing belief that a meeting in Doha this month to discuss production freezes to deal with the supply glut may not come up with anything concrete. So oil could see further volatility ahead, according to Bjarne Schieldrop, chief commodities analyst Nordic bank SEB: The latest price moves to the downside was an accident waiting to happen as far as we can see. We never could believe why much hope at all was placed on the production freeze discussion and the connected Doha meeting on 17 April. Nonetheless it probably helped to hold Brent in a sideways trading range during most of March as well as helping to build up a record net long speculative position in Brent crude. Then with Saudi Arabia\u2019s straight talk on production freeze placing the whole issue in the Iranian camp, the continuous building in Brent speculation halted and is now instead in reverse. Crude is also being hit by an unexpected fall in gasoline demand in the US, as revealed by the Energy Information Administration on Monday. In the wake of the IMF worrying about emerging markets, ratings agency Standard &amp; Poor\u2019s reckons the Asia-Pacific region will still lead global growth this year despite its tumultuous start to the year. In a new report, it said: \u201cWe believe the market\u2019s concerns leading up to the sell-off in global markets, while having some validity, were overdone--and even a bit misguided,\u201d said Paul Gruenwald, Standard &amp; Poor\u2019s chief economist for Asia-Pacific. \u201cWe think that the real challenge is picking up the pace of structural reforms China needs to implement as it moves toward a more consumption- and services-based model with a greater role for the marketplace.\u201d Standard &amp; Poor\u2019s GDP forecast for the region is little changed from November 2015 at 5.3% for 2016 and 5.2% for 2017. \u201cIndia leads the pack with GDP growth projection of 7.9% for the fiscal year ending March 2017. But this is one-cylinder growth led by urban private consumption, and we believe it is not sustainable,\u201d Mr. Gruenwald said. We are maintaining our China GDP growth forecasts of 6.3% for 2016 and 6.1% for 2017. China continues to dominate discussions of the Asia-Pacific (and, at times, global) economic and financial landscape. But gone are the days when forceful, effective, and timely macroeconomic stimulus by Chinese authorities supported domestic (and global) growth and calmed global markets. \u201cMarkets have now shifted their focus to the Chinese currency markets, with the macroeconomic story relegated to a secondary plot,\u201d Mr. Gruenwald said. We have lowered our Japan 2016 GDP growth forecast to 0.8% (from 1.1%) due to a weak finish in 2015 and have kept our 2017 forecast of 0.4% unchanged. This will be a tough year for the Bank of Japan\u2019s reflation program. Monetary conditions are tighter than desired, mainly because of Japan\u2019s safe-haven status in the markets, which leads to a strong yen. The task for other Asia-Pacific economies will be to ensure that flexible markets and sound policies will help them to adjust successfully to China\u2019s new growth drivers. One of the countries to watch for a successful response to China\u2019s rebalancing is Australia. We think that all of the pieces to make this happen are in place--including exchange rate and factor market flexibility, strong government, and nimble financing--but it may take time. We see growth of 2.5%-3% over the next few years, but will be monitoring the composition of investment and exports away from the mining sector. Finally, it is unlikely that the rest of the world will come to the rescue. Reform looks like the only path to higher growth for Asia-Pacific. Falling consumer confidence does not seem to have had much impact on eurozone retail sales, said Bert Colijn of ING Bank, thanks to low inflation and higher disposable income: The worthless start of the year for financial markets still has not impacted consumption in the Eurozone much, as retail trade increased with 0.2% month-on-month and 2.4% year-on-year. This surprised analysts as they had expected retail sales to have remained stable in February. This is the highest reading of retail sales since February 2008, which was the pre-crisis peak. Even though Eurozone consumers are wary of the global economic and political situation, the sharp downturn in consumer confidence over the past months is not yet having much of an impact on retail trade. Negative inflation has been enticing to consumers and stores are profiting. Besides that, the unemployment rate continued to decline in February, which is helping disposable income grow. The months ahead could still be bleaker though as the labour market has lost a bit of its momentum in the first months of the year and today\u2019s Eurozone service sector PMI indicated a slowdown of growth in March. This means that some weakness could still be ahead of us, but the current pace of sales growth is a good sign for the overall performance of the Eurozone economy in the first quarter. Retail sales in the eurozone rose by 0.2% month on month in February and 2.4% year on year, better than analysts had been forecasting. According to a Reuters poll, the month on month figure was expected to be flat and the annual rise 1.9%. Growing demand in France and Spain helped offset a fall in Germany, according to the EU statistics office Eurostat. Sales in Germany fell 0.4% month on month after a 0.1% dip in January. But sales in France rose 0.6% and 0.2% in Spain. Back with the day\u2019s eurozone data, and RBC Capital Markets says it was a mixed picture, particularly for Spain and Italy: An improvement in the headline composite PMI reading for both Spain and Italy disguises a more mixed picture from the details. For Spain, an improvement in the services sector suggests that domestic activity remains relatively resilient in the face of its political paralysis but the Italian services reading points to a worrying slowing in the rate of domestic expansion even if a stronger manufacturing reading compensated this month. Overall, the euro area reading was revised down to 53.1 from the flash of 53.7 leaving it broadly unchanged since February. Taken together, the PMIs are still pointing to growth of 0.4% in the first quarter although we would note that they did somewhat overstate the pace of the recovery the previous quarter. Of equal concern will be the continuing weakness of both input and output prices which remain in negative territory. The uncertainty over the EU referendum is a major reason for the UK economy losing momentum, says James Knightley at ING Bank: The UK\u2019s service sector purchasing managers\u2019 index has risen a fraction more than expected to stand at 53.7 in March versus 52.7 in February (consensus was 53.5). With the manufacturing and construction PMIs remaining little changed (but at least staying in growth territory) the overall composite index has risen to 53.6 from 52.7. This is still well down on the average level of 2015 and suggests that the UK economy has lost momentum at the start of the year. An obvious factor behind this is the upcoming referendum on the UK\u2019s ongoing membership of the European Union. With opinion polls suggesting that the vote will be incredibly close, businesses are likely to act cautiously and not embark on any significant expansion plans until the economic outlook is clearer. This means that investment and labour hiring plans will be more limited, which is something that was also highlighted in the recent Deloitte CFO survey. As such, the economy looks set to post slower growth in the second quarter of 2016 than in first quarter. Should the UK vote to remain within the EU then we suggest that the slowdown will be temporary and the delayed hiring and investment plans will be re\u2014instated, leading to a decent bounce in activity in the second half of 2016. However, should the UK vote to leave then expansion plans are likely to be cancelled, business and consumer sentiment will take a hit and the Bank of England would likely have to step in with policy stimulus to try and shore-up confidence. Still, it was at least growth: The PMI figures seem to suggest a UK interest rate rise is indeed some way off. Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit, said: An upturn in the pace of service sector growth in March was insufficient to prevent the PMI surveys from collectively indicating a slowdown in economic growth in the first quarter. The surveys point to a 0.4% increase in GDP, down from 0.6% in the closing quarter of last year. Across the three main sectors of the economy, firms reported the smallest increase in demand for just over three years, which in turn fed through to a reluctance to take on new staff. March saw the weakest rate of job creation for over two-and-a-half years. Business confidence remains in the doldrums as concerns about the global economy continue to be exacerbated by uncertainty at home, with nerves unsettled by issues such as Brexit and the prospect of further government spending cuts announced in the Budget. It therefore seems unlikely that March\u2019s upturn in the pace of growth represents the start of a longer term upswing. In contrast, the survey data suggest growth is more likely to weaken further in the second quarter. With the PMI already in territory traditionally associated with the Bank of England choosing to loosen policy, interest rate hikes seem a long way off. Commenting on the PMIs, Markit said: UK service sector growth remained sluggish in March, according to the latest PMI survey data from Markit and CIPS. Total activity increased at a slightly faster rate than in February, but on a quarterly basis growth over the first three months of 2016 was the weakest since the first quarter of 2013. Moreover, incoming new business increased at the slowest rate since January 2013. Global economic uncertainty and the upcoming EU membership referendum were commonly reported to be factors undermining service sector business expectations during the month. Employment in the sector continued to rise, but at a rate little-changed from February\u2019s recent low. The latest survey data did signal a rise in inflationary pressures, particularly for charges which increased at the fastest rate in over two years. Markit says the UK has seen the weakest quarter of output growth for three years: Worries about the global economy, as well as the prospect of leaving the European Union, have helped to hold back the UK service sector. The Markit survey for March shows only a slight recovery after the index reached its lowest level in three years in February. The March eurozone PMIs could knock back forecasts for the region\u2019s growth this year, said Howard Archer of IHS Global Insight: A setback to hopes that the Eurozone economy may just be starting to improve after a dreary start to 2016 as the March services purchasing managers index was revised down markedly to be at a 14-month low This meant that overall Eurozone services and manufacturing activity could only edge up in March from the 13-month low suffered in February. The downward revision to the March services PMI fuels concern that Eurozone GDP growth in the first quarter of 2016 was no better than the 0.3% quarter-on-quarter rate seen in both the fourth and third quarters of 2015. Indeed, the composite PMI manufacturing and services output index for the Eurozone dipped to 53.2 in the first quarter of 2016 from 54.1 in the fourth quarter of 2015; this was the lowest quarterly average since the fourth quarter of 2014. However, it should be borne in mind that January hard data for industrial production and retail sales were healthy. Specifically, industrial production jumped 2.1% month on month and 2.8% year on year in January while there was also relatively solid retail sales volume growth of 0.4% month on month and 2.0% year on year in January On balance, we still believe that the Eurozone can achieve GDP growth of 1.6% in 2016, which would match the 2015 outturn. However, the risks to this forecast are clearly slanted to the downside. The market slide is accelerating, with the oil price falling further and the Dax hit particularly hard by the poor factory orders data from Germany. The disappointing service sector data is also hitting sentiment, as well as the downbeat comments from the IMF, with Christine Lagarde warning of risks to the global economy. The FTSE 100 is now down 1.2% while the Dax has dropped just over 2%. France\u2019s Cac is 1.7% lower. Meanwhile Brent crude is 0.7% lower at $37.43 a barrel. The final reading for the eurozone services PMI has shown a dip from the previous month, and is lower than the initial readings suggested. The Markit index came in a 53.1 for March, down from 53.3 in February and lower than the first estimate of 54. The composite index for the eurozone - manufacturing and services - came in at 53.1, up from 53 in February but lower than the initial reading of 53.7. Markit said: March saw the rate of economic expansion in the euro area improve for the first time in three months. The extent of the acceleration was negligible, however, and less marked than that indicated by earlier flash data. Manufacturing saw faster growth of production, but this was mostly offset by a slower rate of output expansion at service providers. Markit said the downward revision to the initial composite reading was mainly driven by France and Italy, which between them accounted for 0.5 points of the 0.6 fall. Germany\u2019s services PMI has also come in below expectations. The index came in at 55.1 in March, down from 55.3 in the previous month and below expectations of a rise to 55.5. The composite index is at an eight month low. Markit economist Oliver Kolodseike said: The German service sector continued to expand at a solid pace at the end of the first quarter, although activity and new order inflows both increased at weaker rates. Moreover, a closer look at the sub- indices highlights some concerns that growth may slow further in coming months. In detail, the amount of work in the pipeline rose only marginally and companies took a more cautious approach with regards to hiring policies, with the rate of job creation the weakest since last July. Meanwhile, input costs faced by service providers rose at the slowest pace for more than six years, as the low interest rate environment continued to exert downward pressure on inflation. Elsewhere Italy also saw a slowdown in service sector growth: And also in the composite PMI: The French service sector has failed to improve as much as expected in March. The Markit survey shows the services PMI still below 50, a sign of contraction, against expectations of a figure of 51.2: The composite index - manufacturing and services - did hit 50, however, up from 49.3 in February and reaching a two month high. Jack Kennedy, senior economist at Markit, said: March PMI data round off a broadly flat performance of the French service sector on average over the first quarter. There remains little sign of the stagnancy lifting \u2013 although business expectations rose to the highest since last August they remain subdued in historical terms. Competitive pressures saw another round of output price cutting as firms competed for new business, underlining the challenging environment. There are also positive service sector figures from Spain, according to Markit. It said: Growth in the Spanish service sector quickened at the end of the first quarter of the year, with both activity and new orders rising at the fastest rates in four months. An increase in outstanding business was also recorded, and higher workloads encouraged further job creation. The rate of input cost inflation remained relatively weak, but companies raised their output prices for the first time since last October. Andrew Harker, senior economist at Markit and author of the report said: The pick-up in service sector growth in March is something of a relief following a slowdown in previous months, and suggests that the Spanish economy was able to maintain forward momentum during the first quarter of the year. Elsewhere, while output prices were raised for the first time in five months, there is still little evidence of any meaningful inflationary pressure returning to the sector. The yen has hit a 17 month high against the dollar, prompting talk of possible intervention: The yen has been boosted by its status as a haven for investors as equities fall back and commodity prices slide. Yujiro Goto, currency strategist at Nomura, told Reuters: Clearly risk sentiment is not good and oil prices are declining this week and all these feeding and driving the dollar lower against the yen. The yen is also higher against other currencies. Of course, the Bank of Japan will be concerned not just about the rise in the yen, but also a drop in stock prices. So we may see some comments from the authorities there, but actual intervention is unlikely until dollar drops below 110 yen. The Irish service sector expanded more quickly in March, according to Markit. Philip O\u2019Sullivan, chief economist at Investec Ireland said: The latest Investec Services PMI Ireland report shows a slight quickening in the rate of growth of business activity, with the headline PMI improving to 62.8 in March from the previous month\u2019s 62.1 reading. This improvement was in spite of a softening in New Orders (to a five month low, albeit it is still in growth territory), while New Export Orders eased to their slowest pace of growth since May 2012. On the latter, while panellists indicated that the UK remained a source of new business, there were suggestions that the recent strengthening of the euro against sterling had weighed on growth of new business. Another warning from the IMF on the global economy, from managing director Christine Lagarde. Katie Allen writes: Governments must urgently pursue more growth-friendly policies to shore up a weakening global economy beset with risks, the head of the International Monetary Fund has said. Christine Lagarde also put governments on alert that they should prepare contingency plans in case threats to the fragile global economy materialise. \u201cThe good news is that the recovery continues. We have growth. We are not in a crisis. The not-so-good news is that the recovery remains too slow, too fragile, and risks to its durability are increasing,\u201d Lagarde said in a lecture at Goethe University in Frankfurt, Germany. \u201cWe are on alert, not alarm. There has been a loss of growth momentum. However, if policymakers can confront the challenges and act together, the positive effects on global confidence, and the global economy, will be substantial,\u201d she said, according to text of her speech. The full story is here: With metal prices and oil falling back, it\u2019s no surprise that commodity companies are among the biggest losers so far. The top fallers in the FTSE 100 are: Tony Cross at Trustnet Direct said: London\u2019s FTSE-100 has started the session with some notable losses as tumbling commodity prices find themselves back at the top of the agenda. Hopes may have been building that we would see another leg higher emerge for the asset class, but yesterday saw the Dow Jones Non Ferrous Metals Index slump almost 5% and WTI crude is eyeing a move back below $35/barrel, too. As a result it\u2019s the natural resources stocks that are scattered across the foot of the index in early trade, with Royal Dutch Shell and BP also being dragged very much into the fray. Interest rate watch: the Reserve Bank of Australia left rates unchanged at 2% as expected, while the Reserve Bank of India cut its main interest rate by 0.25% to 6.5%. As forecast, stock markets in Europe have followed their Asian counterparts with sharp falls in early trading. The FTSE 100 is down 61 points or 1%, while Germany\u2019s Dax has dropped 1.8% after the poor factory order figures and France\u2019s Cac has fallen 1.4%, while Spain\u2019s Ibex is 1.3% lower. The IMF is also concerned about the insurance sector: Across advanced economies the contribution of life insurers to systemic risk has increased in recent years, although it clearly remains below that of banks. This increase is largely due to growing common exposures to aggregate risk, caused partly by a rise in insurers\u2019 interest rate sensitivity. Thus, in the event of an adverse shock, insurers are unlikely to fulfill their role as financial intermediaries precisely when other parts of the financial system are failing to do so as well. The higher common exposures do not seem to be driven by marked changes in insurers\u2019 investment portfolios, although smaller and weaker insurers in some countries have taken on more risk. The findings suggest that supervisors and regulators should take a more macroprudential approach to the sector. Doing so is necessary if supervision is to go beyond guarding against the solvency and contagion risks of individ- ual firms and take on the systemic risk arising from common exposures. Steps that would complement a push for stronger macroprudential policies include the international adoption of capital and transparency standards for the sector. In addition, the different behavior of smaller and weaker insurers warrants attention by supervisors. Policymakers need to act to prevent problems in emerging markets threatening global stability, the IMF has said. In excerpts from its latest financial stability report the fund said: The financial integration of emerging market economies into the global economy has affected international financial markets in both desirable ways\u2014more efficient asset prices and resource allocation\u2014and undesirable ones\u2014amplification of shocks and transmission of excess financial volatility... The significant growth in global capital flows due to mutual fund investments is also affecting the nature and size of financial spillovers from emerging market economies. The decision by mutual funds to sell investments in multiple countries in response to losses in one or more countries, or because of withdrawals by their own investors, is called the portfolio channel of contagion. This channel has gained in importance as a source of financial spillovers from emerging market economies to equity markets in recent years, in line with the increase in asset allocation to these countries. The impact from the portfolio channel from advanced economies remains significantly larger, according to the IMF. The IMF says the influence of China will grow as it becomes more integrated into the global financial system: The IMF research shows that among large emerging market economies, China is unique: news about its economic growth has an economically significant and rising impact on global equity prices. In the last five years alone, the impact of growth surprises from China on global equity prices has almost quadrupled. By contrast, changes in Chinese asset prices tend to have little effect on asset prices elsewhere. \u201cPurely financial spillovers from China are still very small, but likely to grow considerably as China gradually continues to integrate into the global financial system,\u201d said Gaston Gelos, head of the Global Financial Stability Analysis Division at the IMF. So policymakers need to act to safeguard financial stability in the wake of the growing importance of emerging markets: \u201cThe evidence underscores the need for policymakers to take into account economic and policy developments in emerging market economies when assessing their own countries\u2019 prospects,\u201d said Gelos. Enhanced international economic and macroprudential policy cooperation can also play an important role. Other policy measures countries need to implement include: \u2022 In emerging market economies, policymakers can foster the development of a domestic investor base to help dampen the effect of international financial contagion. \u2022 As China\u2019s role in the global financial system continues to grow, policymakers will need clear and timely communication of policy decisions, transparency about policy goals, and strategies to achieve them. \u2022 The amplification of emerging markets\u2019 financial impact on other countries due to corporate debt means policymakers should adopt measures to limit excessive increases in corporate debt that could threaten financial stability. Improving rules to limit systemic risks arising from mutual funds also remains important. \u2022 Lastly, improving data on cross-border financial flows intermediated by banks, investment funds, and large institutional investors is a priority. German factory orders fell unexpectedly in February, according to figures from the economy ministry, hit by a decline in overseas demand. They dropped 1.2%, the biggest monthly fall in six months and well below expectations of a 0.2% rise. Carsten Brzeski at ING Bank said: German new orders dropped sharply in February, adding to evidence of continued stagnation in the German industry. New orders declined by 1.2% month on month, from an upwardly revised increase of 0.5% month on month in January. On the year, new orders were up by 0.5%. The last months have not been easy for the German industry. Since May last year, new orders have dropped in six out of ten months. Interestingly, the February drop was driven by falling foreign demand (-2.7% month on month), whole domestic demand picked up somewhat after a two-months slump. Good morning and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets and business. Stock markets are under pressure again as the International Monetary Fund warned of the knock on effect from growing problems in emerging markets, and oil prices slipped again. Brent crude is down 0.3% at $37.57 a barrel, as hopes of a deal to curb production at this month\u2019s planned meeting of producers continue to fade. The Nikkei 225 is down 2.4%, while the Hang Seng is 1.4% lower. European markets are expected to open lower: Investors will be keen to see the results of the latest services PMI data from Europe and the UK. There was an improvement in the initial March estimates from France, up from 49.2 to 51.2, the best figures since before the Paris terror attacks last year. Expectations are for the final data to show an improvement, with better numbers also forecast for Spain, Italy and Germany. However the recent attacks in Brussels could well have had an effect on sentiment. Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK, said: Since these previous readings the Brussels terror attacks could well had an impact on sentiment, particularly in the travel and hotel sector, which has driven a lot of the improvement in the French numbers. There is a fear that events in Brussels could well have knocked confidence in a sector that appeared to be on the cusp of a fragile recovery. Today\u2019s numbers could well be the first test of that sentiment. In the UK, analysts will look for any signs that the recent Brexit headlines have hit sentiment. Hewson said: Last month we saw the sector post its weakest reading since April 2013 at 52.7. Was this merely a blip or evidence of an element of caution as we head towards the summer vote? Expectations are for a decent end to the first quarter with an improvement to 54, from February\u2019s 52.7.",

The consequences of a vote to leave wouldn\u2019t just be felt temporarily. There would likely be a permanent reduction in exports to the EU, while foreign-direct investment into the UK would also suffer, leading to higher unemployment and a decline in the country\u2019s long-term growth potential. Furthermore, negotiations to leave would be complex and difficult. EU leaders would not be expected to give the UK an easy ride for fear of encouraging others to follow.</p> <p>Looking further ahead, the likely reduction in exports to the EU could reduce national income by three per cent, rising to as much as ten per cent in a worst-case scenario. Finally, the long-term growth potential of the UK could also be negatively impacted by, amongst other things, lower foreign direct investment. While any estimate of that effect is highly speculative, it could potentially shave 0.2-0.4 percentage points off growth.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d3d85a6a7f10c4049bd1c554965109955080df8c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d3d85a6a7f10c4049bd1c554965109955080df8c/66_314_5629_3377/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Aviva Investors warns on Brexit\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Aviva Investors warns on Brexit</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dan Kitwood/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <blockquote> <p>Financial markets would undoubtedly react badly to a vote in favour of \u2018Brexit\u2019 too. Aviva Investors would expect an immediate and sharp fall in the pound. The UK runs comparatively large fiscal and current account deficits, and as such relies on foreign capital to finance the deficiency in domestic saving. If, as anticipated, the uncertainty created by a vote to leave causes international investors to re-appraise their appetite for sterling assets, the decline in the pound could become more severe over time.</p> <p>While the Bank of England would no doubt ease policy in response to any economic downturn, it seems unlikely this would prevent UK share prices from falling sharply. In particular, shares in smaller companies, which tend to rely more on the domestic economy, would probably underperform. The impact on gilts is less clear.

But this is one-cylinder growth led by urban private consumption, and we believe it is not sustainable,\u201d Mr. Gruenwald said.</p> <p>We are maintaining our China GDP growth forecasts of 6.3% for 2016 and 6.1% for 2017. China continues to dominate discussions of the Asia-Pacific (and, at times, global) economic and financial landscape.

Monetary conditions are tighter than desired, mainly because of Japan\u2019s safe-haven status in the markets, which leads to a strong yen.</p> <p>The task for other Asia-Pacific economies will be to ensure that flexible markets and sound policies will help them to adjust successfully to China\u2019s new growth drivers.</p> <p>One of the countries to watch for a successful response to China\u2019s rebalancing is Australia. We think that all of the pieces to make this happen are in place--including exchange rate and factor market flexibility, strong government, and nimble financing--but it may take time.

This surprised analysts as they had expected retail sales to have remained stable in February. This is the highest reading of retail sales since February 2008, which was the pre-crisis peak.</p> <p>Even though Eurozone consumers are wary of the global economic and political situation, the sharp downturn in consumer confidence over the past months is not yet having much of an impact on retail trade. Negative inflation has been enticing to consumers and stores are profiting. Besides that, the unemployment rate continued to decline in February, which is helping disposable income grow. </p> <p>The months ahead could still be bleaker though as the labour market has lost a bit of its momentum in the first months of the year and today\u2019s Eurozone service sector PMI indicated a slowdown of growth in March. This means that some weakness could still be ahead of us, but the current pace of sales growth is a good sign for the overall performance of the Eurozone economy in the first quarter.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57037e9fe4b0fdabeac431c7\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-04-05T09:13:32.444Z\">10.13am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Eurozone retail sales stronger than expected</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Retail sales in the eurozone rose by 0.2% month on month in February and 2.4% year on year, better than analysts had been forecasting.</p> <p>According to a Reuters poll, the month on month figure was expected to be flat and the annual rise 1.9%.</p> <p>Growing demand in France and Spain helped offset a fall in Germany, according to the EU statistics office Eurostat.

With the manufacturing and construction PMIs remaining little changed (but at least staying in growth territory) the overall composite index has risen to 53.6 from 52.7. This is still well down on the average level of 2015 and suggests that the UK economy has lost momentum at the start of the year.</p> <p>An obvious factor behind this is the upcoming referendum on the UK\u2019s ongoing membership of the European Union. With opinion polls suggesting that the vote will be incredibly close, businesses are likely to act cautiously and not embark on any significant expansion plans until the economic outlook is clearer. This means that investment and labour hiring plans will be more limited, which is something that was also highlighted in the recent Deloitte CFO survey. As such, the economy looks set to post slower growth in the second quarter of 2016 than in first quarter.</p> <p>Should the UK vote to remain within the EU then we suggest that the slowdown will be temporary and the delayed hiring and investment plans will be re\u2014instated, leading to a decent bounce in activity in the second half of 2016.</p> <p>However, should the UK vote to leave then expansion plans are likely to be cancelled, business and consumer sentiment will take a hit and the Bank of England would likely have to step in with policy stimulus to try and shore-up confidence.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57037b75e4b0fde262ff64b9\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-04-05T08:47:00.588Z\">9.47am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Still, it was at least growth:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/RBS_Economics/status/717271838548692992\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Weakest UK service sector growth since Q1 2013, but growth none the less and March&#39;s number was a slight improvement <a href=\"https://t.co/TS6rM42Xi3\">pic.twitter.com/TS6rM42Xi3</a></p>&mdash; RBS Economics (@RBS_Economics) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/RBS_Economics/status/717271838548692992\">April 5, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-570379dde4b0d29fa4d0c821\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-04-05T08:42:57.206Z\">9.42am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The PMI figures seem to suggest a UK interest rate rise is indeed some way off.

The surveys point to a 0.4% increase in GDP, down from 0.6% in the closing quarter of last year. </p> <p>Across the three main sectors of the economy, firms reported the smallest increase in demand for just over three years, which in turn fed through to a reluctance to take on new staff. March saw the weakest rate of job creation for over two-and-a-half years. </p> <p>Business confidence remains in the doldrums as concerns about the global economy continue to be exacerbated by uncertainty at home, with nerves unsettled by issues such as Brexit and the prospect of further government spending cuts announced in the Budget.</p> <p>It therefore seems unlikely that March\u2019s upturn in the pace of growth represents the start of a longer term upswing. In contrast, the survey data suggest growth is more likely to weaken further in the second quarter. With the PMI already in territory traditionally associated with the Bank of England choosing to loosen policy, interest rate hikes seem a long way off. </p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57037987e4b0d29fa4d0c820\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-04-05T08:39:09.151Z\">9.39am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Commenting on the PMIs, Markit said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>UK service sector growth remained sluggish in March, according to the latest PMI survey data from Markit and CIPS.

This increase is largely due to growing common exposures to aggregate risk, caused partly by a rise in insurers\u2019 interest rate sensitivity. Thus, in the event of an adverse shock, insurers are unlikely to fulfill their role as financial intermediaries precisely when other parts of the financial system are failing to do so as well. The higher common exposures do not seem to be driven by marked changes in insurers\u2019 investment portfolios, although smaller and weaker insurers in some countries have taken on more risk.</p> <p>The findings suggest that supervisors and regulators should take a more macroprudential approach to the sector. Doing so is necessary if supervision is to go beyond guarding against the solvency and contagion risks of individ- ual firms and take on the systemic risk arising from common exposures. Steps that would complement a push for stronger macroprudential policies include the international adoption of capital and transparency standards for the sector. In addition, the different behavior of smaller and weaker insurers warrants attention by supervisors. </p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4d7e255ca92620d3a7cfea6694f46dd64ca0776a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4d7e255ca92620d3a7cfea6694f46dd64ca0776a/0_0_584_637/458.jpg\" alt=\"Relative size of financial firms\" width=\"458\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Relative size of financial firms</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: IMF</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57036073e4b0f2216ccb2a59\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-04-05T07:02:02.180Z\">8.02am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Policymakers need to act to prevent problems in emerging markets threatening global stability, the IMF has said.</p> <p>In <strong><a href=\"http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/survey/so/2016/POL040416B.htm\">excerpts from its latest financial stability report</a></strong> the fund said:</p> <blockquote> <p>The financial integration of emerging market economies into the global economy has affected international financial markets in both desirable ways\u2014more efficient asset prices and resource allocation\u2014and undesirable ones\u2014amplification of shocks and transmission of excess financial volatility...</p> <p>The significant growth in global capital flows due to mutual fund investments is also affecting the nature and size of financial spillovers from emerging market economies. The decision by mutual funds to sell investments in multiple countries in response to losses in one or more countries, or because of withdrawals by their own investors, is called the portfolio channel of contagion. This channel has gained in importance as a source of financial spillovers from emerging market economies to equity markets in recent years, in line with the increase in asset allocation to these countries. The impact from the portfolio channel from advanced economies remains significantly larger, according to the IMF.</p> </blockquote> <p>The IMF says the influence of China will grow as it becomes more integrated into the global financial system:</p> <blockquote> <p>The IMF research shows that among large emerging market economies, China is unique: news about its economic growth has an economically significant and rising impact on global equity prices. In the last five years alone, the impact of growth surprises from China on global equity prices has almost quadrupled. By contrast, changes in Chinese asset prices tend to have little effect on asset prices elsewhere.</p> <p>\u201cPurely financial spillovers from China are still very small, but likely to grow considerably as China gradually continues to integrate into the global financial system,\u201d said Gaston Gelos, head of the Global Financial Stability Analysis Division at the IMF.</p> </blockquote> <p>So policymakers need to act to safeguard financial stability in the wake of the growing importance of emerging markets:</p> <blockquote> <p>\u201cThe evidence underscores the need for policymakers to take into account economic and policy developments in emerging market economies when assessing their own countries\u2019 prospects,\u201d said Gelos. </p> <p>Enhanced international economic and macroprudential policy cooperation can also play an important role.</p> <p>Other policy measures countries need to implement include:</p> <p>\u2022 In emerging market economies, policymakers can foster the development of a domestic investor base to help dampen the effect of international financial contagion.</p> <p>\u2022 As China\u2019s role in the global financial system continues to grow, policymakers will need clear and timely communication of policy decisions, transparency about policy goals, and strategies to achieve them. </p> <p>\u2022 The amplification of emerging markets\u2019 financial impact on other countries due to corporate debt means policymakers should adopt measures to limit excessive increases in corporate debt that could threaten financial stability. Improving rules to limit systemic risks arising from mutual funds also remains important.</p> <p>\u2022 Lastly, improving data on cross-border financial flows intermediated by banks, investment funds, and large institutional investors is a priority. </p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57035cebe4b0d29fa4d0c7f7\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-04-05T06:40:31.164Z\">7.40am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">German industrial orders in surprise fall</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>German factory orders fell unexpectedly in February, according to figures from the economy ministry, hit by a decline in overseas demand.</p> <p>They dropped 1.2%, the biggest monthly fall in six months and well below expectations of a 0.2% rise.

      "bodyText": "Nearly 600 jobs are at risk at Sainsbury\u2019s as the retailer reduces the number of in-store staff trainers. The supermarket chain, which is buying Argos\u2019s owner, Home Retail Group, for \u00a31.4bn, has begun consultation with 870 training staff about changes to their jobs. Sainsbury\u2019s wants to employ 280 of them as senior trainers who will work across several stores and said it will try to redeploy the rest. The trade union Unite said it was disappointed at the potential job losses. The national officer for food and drink, Julia Long, said: \u201cThis is very bad news for those dedicated workers affected by the planned job losses and Unite will be giving our members maximum support at this difficult time. \u201cWe are severely disappointed as Sainsbury\u2019s seems to have deep pockets when it wants, as it has just forked out \u00a31.4bn to purchase the Home Retail Group. We appreciate that Sainsbury\u2019s has a good record of redeployment of staff in these situations and we will be exploring every avenue to ensure continuing employment for our members.\u201d Neil Saunders of retail analysis firm Conlumino said: \u201cThere is definitely a risk that the removal of these posts could weaken customer service. The benefits of an in-store trainer are that they are on the ground to support training needs and can carefully monitor progress and identify areas that need addressing. They also form a close and personal relationship with the staff in the store. \u201cGiven that service is a critical differentiator for Sainsbury\u2019s this is a risk that the firm will have to manage carefully,\u201d he said. Sainsbury\u2019s is also consulting with 1,900 night workers about changes to their hours. The supermarket said it no longer needed people to work through the night but would be moving hours to late evening and early morning and that no jobs would be cut. Sainsbury\u2019s said: \u201cWe\u2019ve introduced new learning and development programmes to ensure our colleagues can continue to deliver the very best service to our customers. Following this, we\u2019re now creating a new management role that will provide enhanced training support across a number of stores. This position will replace the existing store trainer role.\u201d Retailers are looking for ways to save money as they implement the new \u201cnational living wage\u201d. The \u00a37.20 compulsory hourly minimum for workers over 25, which came in last week, will rise every year and reach about \u00a39 an hour by 2020. Retailers will take the biggest financial hit from the changes, at a time when supermarkets are locked in a fierce price war to fend off discounters Aldi and Lidl. Sainsbury\u2019s is the only one of the big four UK supermarkets experiencing sales growth, according to figures from Kantar Worldpanel. Sales rose 1.2% in the three months to the end of March, helped by new store openings, while Tesco\u2019s sales slid by 0.2% and Morrisons fell 2.4% after selling off its convenience store chain. Asda\u2019s sales slumped 3.9%. The Co-op enjoyed the strongest pace of sales growth since it bought the Somerfield chain five years ago, with sales up 3.9%. The latest cuts at Sainsbury\u2019s come after the supermarket cut 800 jobs in its stores last year as part of plans to save \u00a3500m over three years. The supermarket group, which also axed 500 head office jobs, in January 2015, cut department and deputy manager positions in some stores. Sainsbury\u2019s profits slid 18% in the six months to 26 September, the company\u2019s lowest first-half profit since 2010 as it was forced to shut stores and cut prices. The chain now faces the major challenge of integrating Argos after Home Retail Group\u2019s board backed its \u00a31.4bn takeover bid last week. Asda, Morrisons and Tesco have also cut hundreds of jobs in stores and at their head offices in an attempt to keep down costs. Some staff have enjoyed pay rises before the introduction of the national minimum wage, but that has been offset by cuts to benefits including Sunday and holiday pay or paid breaks.",

      "bodyText": "If Michael Heseltine has made any public comments about Tata\u2019s looming closure of the steel plant in Port Talbot, I missed it. The normally loyal Hezza\u2019s silence speaks loudly about the failure of David Cameron\u2019s government to anticipate the crisis or take effective action to mitigate its fearful consequences. One of the more boneheaded consequences may be a boost for the Brexit campaign. It is not as if the Swansea-born former deputy prime minister, ex-trade secretary and self-made wealthy entrepreneur is sentimental about the industry, any more than he was when he forced pit closures in the 90s. Only last November Hezza was blandly telling Sky News that job losses at Tata would be \u201cpainful for those who suffer\u201d but that a buoyant UK labour market means it is as good a time as any to lose them. But we can be reasonably confident that he would have grasped the significance of Tata\u2019s looming board meeting in Mumbai and not jetted off to Australia as Sajid Javid, his hapless successor as business secretary, did until hauled back by a similarly chillaxed David \u201cLanzarote\u201d Cameron. Javid\u2019s vestigial chances of future Downing Street glory are now worse than Port Talbot\u2019s chances of a rescue. It serves him right. All is not quite lost for the steel plant. Several potential buyers are sniffing around, smelling a potential bargain. In interviews Sanjeev Gupta , the Indian-born commodities tycoon, sounds very level headed, even as he talked of retaining all 5,000 workers to recycle UK-made steel rather than export it. Can this be realistic? Or rival inquiries from ThyssenKrupp or US company doctor, Wilbur Ross? Heseltine was a successful industrial interventionist, unlike the Thatcherite theoreticians whose free market excesses Larry Elliott rightly derided here this week. His desire to see the Westland helicopter firm merged inside Europe, not in the US, triggered his 1986 cabinet resignation (and Thatcher\u2019s fall in 1990), and was eventually vindicated: AgustaWestland is now an Anglo-Italian success. Unlike the former DeutscheBank paper shuffler Javid, Hezza did not subscribe to actor-president Ronald Reagan\u2019s dictum: \u201cDon\u2019t just do something. Stand there.\u201d Hezza would have done something, even if it didn\u2019t work. As South Wales engages in a white knuckle wait for its fate, a victim of global forces way beyond Port Talbot or Cardiff\u2019s control, what does the crisis also tell us, not just about inexperienced personalities at the top, but about the structures and competence of assorted governments whose finger prints are on steel policymaking? The role of Labour-led devolved government in Cardiff Bay is most easily disposed of. Tata plays in a much bigger league. Carwyn Jones, Wales\u2019s first minister, whom Cameron was meeting on Tuesday, blames the PM for being \u201cslow and inadequate\u201d. Jones\u2019s own critics at home, who seek to deprive Labour of its majority in the Welsh assembly elections on 5 May, say he has failed too. Labour has been in power here since 1999, too long to be healthy, so they may have a point. But devolved government, on which Cameron and George (\u201cMarch of the Makers\u201d) Osborne are now so keen, carries risk, as Belgium\u2019s fragmented system so painfully demonstrated before, during and after the Brussels bombing. It\u2019s fine for second order policies in good weather, less sea-worthy when storms blow up and a strong hand is needed on the tiller. Much poorer than Scotland with a less developed political and economic culture, Wales is more easily neglected at the eastern end of the M4. Cameron has repeatedly used the failings of the Welsh NHS as a punchbag behind which he can hide the failings of NHS England, some of which are down to him. The same can be said of energy policy, business tax policy and public procurement, it\u2019s all a UK matter. So is sucking up (kow-towing?) to China in the hope of inward investment while cheap Chinese steel imports damage similar UK steel. At least the local Labour MP, Stephen (son of Neil) Kinnock, had the wit to fly to Mumbai with concerned trades unions, though they would not have commanded the attention a UK cabinet minister might have had. The official Javid and Cameron left in charge is Anna Soubry , journalist turned TV presenter and lawyer, currently minister for small businesses, which UK steelmaking may soon become. Brainy bumbler, Oliver Letwin, the Tory angel of death, is also said to be on the case. Not good enough. But nor has Labour\u2019s response been. Jeremy Corbyn went to Port Talbot. Good for him. John McDonnell has called \u2013 surprise, surprise \u2013 for steel renationalisation. So far as I can tell no one listened with great fervour, even when Keynsian Liberal Democrat, Vince Cable (remember him?) said the same. The awkward fact is that Labour is in opposition (Lib Dems too) and hellbent on staying there. Camp Corbyn\u2019s industrial base is mostly in the public services sector and Port Talbot is accustomed to a higher standard of acting. Richard Burton, Anthony Hopkins and Michael Sheen are all local boys. The Law of Unintended Welsh Consequences is also busy giving the Brexiteers an opportunity to distribute \u201cif you want to save steel, vote leave\u201d fliers in Port Talbot. It is a risk that the ex-Welsh secretary Peter Hain concedes is real. Why so? Because EU rules on unfair state subsidies cover business rate reductions targeted at a particular industry. But hang on there. Hasn\u2019t the UK government increased business rates ? Hasn\u2019t Germany subsidised heavy industry\u2019s energy costs 40 times more than Britain\u2019s since 2013 (so the FT confirms) and didn\u2019t the UK government decide to set a minimum price for carbon emissions above the EU\u2019s market level? These are all things we have done/not done here, our \u201csovereign\u201d action as unimpeded as it was when Britain went to war in Iraq. Yes, the EU creates some difficulties (rescuing the steel pension fund may present another challenge), but others fight or circumvent them with greater vigour than posturing UK ministers for whom \u201cblame Brussels\u201d has become a tabloid default position. So far as I can tell, experts are relatively agreed that energy costs are not the crucial determinant in crippling Port Talbot\u2019s output, cheap imports from China are the main culprit. Here too Cameron and Javid talk a dud game. The FT reported on Saturday that EU officials are protesting that the Brits blocked the best route (known as the \u201clesser duty rule\u201d) for taking anti-dumping measures, and did so on anti-protectionist grounds. Those naughty Europeans, eh? Banker Javid appeared to confirm this on Sunday sofa TV. Not that investment banks ever need state protection, of course. Even Brexit jihadis at the Daily Mail appear to agree. All EU steelmakers face challenges from cheap Chinese steel, a problem that will not go away, inside the EU or outside it. But other countries and their industries are faster footed at responding. Until recently oversophisticated British ministers have been deriding exhortations to buy British, though that stance has now been modified for public sector contracts. French people buy French without being told. So ships, bridges etc are still being built with foreign steel imports. Nothing wrong with trade, provided it\u2019s fair trade. Yet a country with lingering pretensions to a serious defence policy cannot do so without a capacity to make the basic ingredient of modern warfare. It would be funny if it wasn\u2019t scary. Perhaps that\u2019s why Mrs T settled for only being an Iron Lady. Last but not least, painful for progressives to admit, Ed Miliband\u2019s 2008 Climate Change Act, which committed Britain to being a \u201cworld leader in reducing CO2 emissions\u201d (despite being only responsible for 2% of them) didn\u2019t help. It now looks like the kind of vanity project which has hurt UK industry without doing much good. And don\u2019t forget that in his \u201chug a huskie\u201d phase Cameron whipped Tory MPs to vote for the bill too. It was a pricing gift to rival steelmakers, an example of the kind of moral imperialism as arrogant and self-regarding in its own way as the old-fashioned variety or more recently unilateral nuclear disarmament. What a painful learning curve we are on.",

      "bodyText": "BrewDog, the craft brewer that prides itself on the \u201cpunk\u201d ethos behind its beers, is plotting a move into coffee in an attempt to lure more customers to its bars during the day. The Scottish company\u2019s annual accounts show that it has bought a 33% stake in Edinburgh-based Third Wave Coffee. Third Wave houses a coffee shop called Brew Lab that espouses similar principles to BrewDog by presenting a craft alternative to multinational corporations. The name is understood to be a reference to the so-called second wave of coffee culture that saw chains such as Starbucks and Costa come to dominate the high street coffee industry. BrewDog wants to offer Third Wave\u2019s coffee in its 29 UK bars. The move echoes efforts by pub chain JD Wetherspoon to boost revenues and get more people through the door by serving breakfasts from 7am. While BrewDog customers can already order coffee produced by a third party, the decision to buy a stake in Third Wave marks an evolution in its efforts to attract caffeine lovers. Figures released by BrewDog show that pre-tax profit fell from \u00a33.65m to \u00a33.5m last year. Profits stagnated despite a 51% increase in revenue, from \u00a330m to \u00a344.7m, with UK sales up by 131%. This was largely down to heavy investment to increase the company\u2019s brewing capacity amid a surge of interest in independent brewers. The company\u2019s spending included \u00a320m at its Ellon brewery on the east coast of Scotland, designed to increase capacity fivefold to 1m hectolitres a year. BrewDog is investing \u00a317.6m to build a brewery in Columbus, Ohio, as it looks to break into the highly competitive US craft beer market. And the company opened 16 new bars in 2015, capitalising on its status as the fastest-growing UK food and drinks company over the past four years. It also succeeded with a fourth round of its equity for punks crowdfunding initiative, which has seen BrewDog raise \u00a314m, a world record for equity crowdfunding. BrewDog\u2019s publicity strategy has included high-profile stunts designed to show off its zany, independent credentials, including throwing taxidermy \u201cfat cats\u201d out of a helicopter over London. The company\u2019s annual report was characterised by the same irreverent humour. \u201cWe kidnapped the president of [multinational drinks company] AB InBev and forced him to drink beer,\u201d the report said, among a list of achievements for 2015, before adding: \u201cThis did not actually happen. Although it is a good idea.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The Co-op is enjoying the strongest pace of sales growth since buying the Somerfield chain five years ago as the early Easter period boosted the grocery market. Sales across the sector increased by 1.1% as Tesco, Morrisons and Asda slowed the pace of decline and Sainsbury\u2019s stepped up growth in the three months to the end of March. The Co-op, which is expected to release its full-year results on Thursday, said sales increased by 3.9%. The retailer has enjoyed a turnaround in fortunes thanks to improvements in its stores and product range. It is also benefiting from the trend towards shopping little and often, which is hitting large out of town stores. Fraser McKevitt, head of retail and consumer insight at Kantar Worldpanel, said shoppers have been visiting the Co-op\u2019s stores more frequently, especially for fresh food and own-label items. Many of its shops remained open on Easter Sunday when many larger supermarkets were closed. McKevitt added: \u201cAn early Easter gave the market a sales boost of \u00a3152m compared with last year, adding 0.6% to the overall growth rate. Britain\u2019s love of all things sweet was in evidence, with 63% of households buying at least one chocolate egg during March, spending an average of \u00a312 over the month. Over half of the population bought hot cross buns, while 15% purchased a fresh leg of lamb for their Easter celebrations.\u201d Analysts at rival market analysis firm Nielsen said the volume of items sold at UK grocers had risen by 1.3% in the month to 26 March \u2013 after six periods of declines. But the value of sales during the two-week Easter trading period were down 2% compared to last year as a result of price cuts. Nielsen\u2019s UK head of retailer and business insight Mike Watkins said: \u201cOnly confectionery, alcohol and, to a lesser degree, some fresh foods provided positive industry growth. Getting back to sustained sales growth really requires deflation to be replaced by low inflation.\u201d Asda, which is cutting prices and jobs to try to win back shoppers, continued to fare the worst out of the big four grocers, with sales falling by 3.9% over the three-month period, according to Kantar. \u201cAsda\u2019s performance did not improve materially and we wonder how long this can continue without a response,\u201d said Dave McCarthy, a retail analyst at HSBC. Bruno Monteyne at Bernstein Research said: \u201cAsda is hurt by the growth in convenience retail, a market in which it does not operate, and is the biggest market share donor to the discounters.\u201d Discounters Aldi and Lidl continued their strong pace of growth \u2013 up 14.4% and 17.7% respectively \u2013 nudging Aldi to within a hair\u2019s breadth of taking over the Co-op to become the UK\u2019s fifth largest grocer. The German chain holds a 6% share of the UK market compared with 6.1% for the Co-op. Tesco\u2019s sales slid by just 0.2%, Morrisons was down 2.4% while Sainsbury\u2019s, the strongest of the big four, increased sales by 1.2%. McCarthy said Sainsbury\u2019s was helped by the opening of new stores.",

      "bodyText": "The slowing global economy and uncertainty over the EU referendum weighed on Britain\u2019s services sector in March, in the latest sign that the UK recovery is losing momentum. A closely watched survey suggested that progress in the UK\u2019s dominant sector came to a virtual standstill last month as companies weighed up a combination of risks, including the looming prospect of an exit from the EU. The sector, which includes restaurants, bars and hotels, experienced the weakest quarter in three years during the first three months of the year, according to the Markit/Cips PMI index. James Knightley, a senior global economist at ING, said concerns over the possibility of Britain leaving the EU were weighing heavily on the services sector, which accounts for about three-quarters of the UK economy. \u201cWith opinion polls suggesting that the vote will be incredibly close, businesses are likely to act cautiously and not embark on any significant expansion plans until the economic outlook is clearer,\u201d he said. \u201cThis means that investment and labour hiring plans will be more limited.\u201d The March services PMI was the latest indication that economic growth has slowed since the beginning of the year. Chris Williamson, the chief economist at Markit, said that along with equivalent surveys for the manufacturing and construction sectors, the report suggested that the economy grew by 0.4% in the first quarter, compared with 0.6% in the fourth quarter of 2015. \u201cBusiness confidence remains in the doldrums as concerns about the global economy continue to be exacerbated by uncertainty at home, with nerves unsettled by issues such as Brexit and the prospect of further government spending cuts announced in the budget,\u201d he said. The report showed a slight improvement in overall activity in March. The headline index edged up to 53.7, from 52.7 in February. Any figure above 50 indicates expansion. However, confidence among companies operating in the sector dipped and new business growth slowed. Williamson said growth was likely to slow further. \u201cIt seems unlikely that March\u2019s upturn in the pace of growth represents the start of a longer term upswing,\u201d he said. \u201cIn contrast, the survey data suggest growth is more likely to weaken further in the second quarter.\u201d Williamson said the prospect of a rise in UK interest rates seemed \u201ca long way off\u201d.

      "bodyText": "Card Factory has said the \u201cnational living wage\u201d will cost it an extra \u00a32.5m a year, squeezing margins at the cards and gifts retailer. Announcing a 25% rise in annual profit, the no-frills chain said it was cutting costs to offset higher wage bills and the increased cost of buying products caused by the pound\u2019s recent fall. Card Factory, which has more than 800 shops, said it had found \u00a31m of savings to \u201cmitigate\u201d the effects of higher staff costs and that it expected to find about another \u00a31m, limiting the effect. Richard Hayes, the chief executive, said: \u201cThe significant cost pressures facing our sector, in particular foreign exchange rates and the new national living wage, will slightly reduce our operating margin percentage in the full year 2017, post mitigation. \u201cWe estimate that, in each year over the next five years, the implementation of [national living wage] will increase store wages by approximately \u00a32.5m per annum.\u201d Hayes indicated the firm would not increase prices to make up for higher wages, and said Card Factory\u2019s ability to cut costs would give it an advantage over rivals. The chancellor, George Osborne, announced national living wage at last year\u2019s post-election budget and it was introduced on 1 April this year. The change increased minimum pay for over-25s to \u00a37.20 an hour from \u00a36.70 under the minimum wage, with the national minimum wage rising to \u00a39 an hour by 2020. Retailers will have to find \u00a33bn a year by 2020 to pay the increased wage, the British Retail Consortium lobby said last week. Some analysts have predicted higher prices or big job cuts and B&amp;Q, the DIY chain, has faced protests over plans to cut Sunday pay and reduce bank holiday rates for some workers in return for higher minimum wages. Hayes did not detail the savings that the company expected to make. It showed its ability to adapt to higher costs in January when it cut the handles off thousands of carrier bags to avoid the government\u2019s 5p plastic bag charge. In addition to higher wages, Card Factory said it had higher purchasing costs because it pays for more than half its products in US dollars and the pound had fallen heavily against the dollar. Pretax profit for the year to the end of January, excluding one-off items, rose 25% to \u00a382m on revenue up 8% to \u00a3382m. Sales at stores open a year or more accelerated to 2.7% from 1.8% a year earlier. The company increased its final dividend by a third to 6p a share. Card Factory listed on the stock market in May 2014 and has been one of the more successful companies from the surge of offerings at the time. Its shares, which listed at 225p, rose 3% to 334p on Tuesday morning.",

Within a few months, it becomes clear that the prediction was too optimistic. The IMF then cuts the forecast, adding a warning to its 188 member countries that they need to do more, individually and collectively, to boost activity. Christine Lagarde, the IMF\u2019s managing director, has made it plain that another downgrade is anticipated when the Washington-based organisation publishes its World Economic Outlook next week. The IMF had been expecting a stronger performance from the advanced economies of the west to compensate for weaker growth in some of the leading emerging markets, such as China and Brazil. This hasn\u2019t happened. Wealthier nations have been unable to rid themselves of the unwanted legacies of the global financial crisis: high levels of government, consumer and bank debt, low levels of investment and unusually poor rates of productivity growth. The unprecedented stimuli provided by central banks has kept activity ticking over, but proved unable to lift the global economy out of what Lagarde calls \u201cthe new mediocre\u201d. Hence her call for monetary policy \u2013 interest rates and quantitative easing \u2013 to be buttressed by structural reform and fiscal activism as part of a three-pronged approach to raise growth. The message from the IMF is clear, that monetary policy is being asked to do too much. Given the distortions due to ultra-low interest rates and the speculation in asset markets caused by QE, it is hard to dispute this analysis. There is a strong case for the sort of structural reform that Lagarde wants \u2013 a higher minimum wage in the US and better training to help people find jobs in the eurozone. The argument for higher public spending on infrastructure projects is even stronger. The problem, though, is this. Lagarde has been the IMF managing director since 2011 and will start a second five-year term in the summer. Her latest speech was in Germany, which has the capacity to provide the fiscal stimulus that the IMF is keen to see. However, there is not the slightest scrap of evidence that Berlin will take any notice. Why? Because under her leadership, the IMF has been strong at providing policy advice, but poor at turning analysis into action. Being an effective IMF chief means more than having a nice turn of phrase. It requires the right analysis, a sense of dynamism and a willingness to bang heads together. The organisation should be championing a global growth pact and cajoling countries such as Germany to sign up to it. Instead, for all the fine speeches, there is a sense of drift.",

      "bodyText": "The metals tycoon Sanjeev Gupta, a potential buyer for the Port Talbot steelworks, has said he believes he can revive Tata Steel\u2019s UK business without any job losses at the plant. Gupta said it would take years to make the Tata Steel business viable, but added that his Liberty House company was interested in acquiring the assets, including the Port Talbot site in south Wales, which employs 4,000 workers. Tata\u2019s total UK workforce is 15,000. Speaking before a meeting with the business secretary, Sajid Javid, on Tuesday, Gupta said the biggest obstacle to reviving the loss-making business was the giant blast furnace at Port Talbot. But he suggested it could be possible to switch to arc furnaces to recycle scrap steel instead of importing raw materials and then exporting scrap. Asked if he thought the business could be overhauled without job losses, Gupta said: \u201cYes, absolutely, that would be my intention.\u201d Liberty House already owns steel plants in the UK, including in south Wales, and has been taking on assets affected by the crisis in the steel industry. It reopened a steel mill in Newport, south Wales, last year after spending two years reviving the site. Last month, Gupta also bought two mills in Scotland that had belonged to Tata Steel. Gupta told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme that he believed 2,000 of Port Talbot\u2019s workers employed at the blast furnace could be redeployed within the business. He has argued for some time that British steel\u2019s future lies in recycling scrap rather than importing slabs to be melted down. But Gupta warned that it was early days and that his company had not had the chance to inspect Tata Steel\u2019s business or talk to it or the government. \u201cWhat anybody looking at this prospect must contend with is: \u2018What is the main problem of the viability of this business?\u2019 The main problem we see is the blast furnace, because they are importing all their own materials \u2026 It will take years to make this transition from blast furnaces to arc furnaces, but there has to be a long-term plan.\u201d Gupta said Tata Steel\u2019s pension fund, with 130,000 members and liabilities of almost \u00a315bn, was another barrier to a rescue. He declined to say whether Liberty House would buy Tata Steel\u2019s UK business if the pension fund were separated off. \u201cIt is certainly an issue that has to be tackled, but for us the focus is the absolute viability of the plant first,\u201d he said. Gupta will meet Javid, who has faced fierce criticism for his handling of the steel crisis, before the business secretary flies to Mumbai for talks with Tata chiefs. He was in Australia when Tata announced its plan to sell the UK steel business last week and was forced to return to the UK.",

However, if policymakers can confront the challenges and act together, the positive effects on global confidence, and the global economy, will be substantial,\u201d she said, according to text of her speech. The global outlook had weakened over the last six months, made worse by China\u2019s slowdown, lower commodity prices and the prospect of financial tightening for many countries, she said. \u201cEmerging markets have largely driven the recovery and the expectation was that the advanced economies would pick up the growth baton. That has not happened.\u201d After turbulence on financial markets at the start of the year, the mood had brightened, Lagarde said. That was thanks to fresh support from the European Central Bank, an apparent shift to a slower pace of rate increases by the US Federal Reserve, a recovery in oil prices and lower capital outflows from China. But \u201cdownside risks remain and have probably increased\u201d, she said, including legacies of the financial crisis in advanced economies: high debt, low inflation, low investment, low productivity, and for some, high unemployment. For emerging and developing economies, risks stemmed from lower commodity prices, higher corporate debt and volatile capital flows. Each of these risks had the potential to spill over into other regions \u201cwith greater frequency and force than ever before\u201d, Lagarde said. Those remarks mirrored an IMF warning on Monday that China\u2019s influence on the global financial instability would only grow in coming years. That trend made timely communication and transparency from Beijing all the more important, the Fund said in a pre-released chapter of its global financial stability report. Lagarde also highlighted greater risks to financial stability and a slowdown in global trade. She joined other international bodies in calling for governments to take their own actions to shore up economic growth rather than relying on central banks to keep interest rates low and print electronic money. That followed the IMF\u2019s earlier call in February for finance ministers to boost public spending. It also said the UK should ease back on austerity should the economy slow further. Setting out the IMF\u2019s position ahead of its spring meetings with global policymakers, Lagarde used her Frankfurt speech to call again for more growth-friendly policies such as tax incentives and investment in innovation and infrastructure. She held up the examples of Japan, which is investing in childcare to help more women work, and India, which cut spending on energy subsidies so it can invest more in social infrastructure such as schools and hospitals. Those countries in a position to spend or cut taxes should do so, she said. \u201cOf course, countries with high and increasing debt, and elevated sovereign spreads need to pursue further fiscal consolidation. But others may have room for fiscal expansion. \u201cCountries should also prepare fiscally smart contingency measures that can be implemented promptly should downside risks materialise.\u201d Lagarde also voiced her concerns that in the face of inequality, terrorism, health epidemics and the refugee crisis, some voters and policymakers were turning to nationalism and protectionism. The IMF head, who recently made clear she wants Britain to stay in the EU, warned against that trend and called for closer cooperation. \u201cFrustrations are leading people to question established institutions and international norms,\u201d she said. \u201cTo some, the answer is to look inward, to somehow unwind these linkages, to close borders and retreat into protectionism. As history has told us time and again, this would be a tragic course. The answer to the reality of our interconnected world is not fragmentation. It is cooperation.\u201d In its latest outlook for the world economy in January the IMF cut its growth forecasts for the next two years and said recovery from the financial crisis could be derailed altogether if key challenges are mishandled. In the update to its World Economic Outlook, it predicted growth of 3.4% this year. A new World Economic Outlook will be published next week ahead of the IMF and World Bank spring meetings in Washington from 15 to 17 April.",

      "bodyText": "The National Farmers\u2019 Union (NFU) is launching its first shoppers\u2019 sourcing guide to help consumers compare rival supermarkets\u2019 policies when they want to buy British food. Just two weeks after it criticised Tesco for announcing a series of farm brands to sell products, based on British-sounding, but fictitious names, the NFU is publishing up-to-date information on supermarkets\u2019 sourcing policies on own-brand products. It aims to provide a guide to food categories such as beef and lamb, fruit and vegetables, dairy, poultry and eggs. The ideal ranking will be a listing of 100% British when in season. Retailers who have failed to provide information about sourcing or origin \u2013 or been vague about it \u2013 will have their entries listed with a space or a series of question marks. Tesco, the UK\u2019s largest retailer, was accused by the NFU and the Soil Association in March of misleading shoppers when it introduced made-up names \u2013 Woodside, Willow and Boswell farms \u2013 on labelling for pork, chicken and beef, alongside Nightingale and Redmere on salad and vegetable items, Rosedene on berries, apples and pears, and Suntrail Farms on a range of fruit imported from overseas. The NFU said transparency and honesty was key to helping shoppers wade through the maze of different policies, labelling and even misleading advertisements. In the run-up to Easter, the UK\u2019s major supermarkets were criticised for the amount of imported lamb \u2013 chilled and frozen from New Zealand \u2013 on their shelves, rather than early season British lamb. \u201cWe want to promote British food to the general public and support shoppers who want to buy British food by helping them find it at different retailers,\u201d said Ruth Mason, the NFU\u2019s chief food chain adviser. \u201cWe had planned to do this before Tesco announced its new series of farm brands but that makes our exercise particularly pertinent and, we believe, invaluable for consumers. \u201cWhat is needed is transparency. The overriding message for consumers is to buy British food from your local supermarket and use this guide to be more savvy about retailer sourcing policies for own-brand products.\u201d Tesco \u2013 which has subsequently met with NFU advisers to discuss the fictitious farm names \u2013 said the labels reflected a brand rather than actual farms and were designed to assure customers that the produce was from trusted suppliers who met its quality standards \u2013 whether in the UK or abroad. The NFU, which has 50,000 members representing 70% of farmland in England and Wales, plans to engage directly with consumers via social and print media. German discounter Aldi is the only supermarket to have signed up to the NFU\u2019s Fruit and Veg Pledge, a scheme which aims to improve long-term relationships with British growers and suppliers. Mason said the union was in discussions with other retailers to persuade them to come on board and hoped to make a further announcement soon.",
