      "bodyText": "You wait half a decade for the European Union to lay a formal competition charge against Google, then it comes served with a side dish. Commissioner Margrethe Vestager\u2019s core allegation is that Google distorts search results to favour its in-house shopping service. The follow-up \u2013 potentially more serious for the US tech company \u2013 is a probe into the Android operating system. Have smartphone manufacturers, for instance, been pressured into pre-loading or bundling Google services? Vestager\u2019s moves should be welcomed. Her predecessor, Joaqu\u00edn Almunia, laboured fruitlessly with his investigation for five years, floating three settlements with the US firm that quickly collapsed. Formal charges at least offer the prospect of resolution one way or another. The outcome may not be quick \u2013 count the years, not the months \u2013 but these issues are important. The digital world has a tendency to create winner-takes-all monopolies. If consumers require protection against abuse, let\u2019s see action rather than Almunia\u2019s confused dance. Vestager\u2019s other challenge, as a competition watchdog, is to keep politicians off her patch and protect the independence of her office. From the US, the cry will be heard that protectionist Europeans, envious of Silicon Valley\u2019s success, are indulging luddite instincts and seeking a US tech scalp. Vestager can\u2019t be deaf to the noise. But, on day one, she did an admirable job of insisting that politics and nationality played no part in her decision. She should stick rigidly to that script. Concerns about the power of Google extend well beyond competition matters (tax, data surveillance and so on), but Vestager is a competition commissioner. When a single company has 90% of a market, it\u2019s about time somebody thrashed out pure questions of competition. Failings fined In regulatory eyes, failing to keep customers\u2019 deposits properly ringfenced is a serious no-no. The basic principle here is that it must always be possible to tell whose money is whose. Nobody wants a repeat of the mess and litigation that followed the collapse of Lehman Brothers in 2008. Bank of New York Mellon therefore deserves to be whacked heavily by the UK\u2019s Financial Conduct Authority for failing to follow the rules. It is the world\u2019s biggest custodian of assets and the balances held by two relevant entities \u2013 the London end and an international business \u2013 peaked at \u00a31.3tn and \u00a3236bn respectively. The fine of \u00a3126m is a record for this type of offence. Indeed, apart from big banks\u2019 fines for rigging foreign exchange and Libor markets, only JP Morgan\u2019s \u201cLondon Whale\u201d fiasco has been punished more heavily by the chief UK financial regulator. But here\u2019s the alarming part. BNY Mellon was found to be in breach of the rules for almost six years, from November 2007 to August 2013. That\u2019s a very long time when a firm is \u201csystemically important to the UK market\u201d, as the FCA puts it. It is the duty of the company to ensure its house is in order since the regulator can\u2019t be everywhere. But six years? What else remains undiscovered? Not so giant What a surprise: there may not, after all, be a giant oilfield under southern England, around the Horse Hill area near Gatwick airport. Or, rather, if there is, it could be tricky to get the stuff out of the ground. Stock market tiddler UK Oil &amp; Gas has issued a \u201cclarification of press comment,\u201d a statement that requires a clarification in itself. It was the gushing comments of the company\u2019s own bosses, including chairman David Lenigas on the BBC, that needed to be put straight. In short, the company overdid the hyperbole. The estimated hydrocarbon volumes \u201cshould not be considered as either contingent or prospective resources or reserves\u201d, it says now. Strictly speaking, last week\u2019s formal statement said nothing inaccurate. It was the extrapolation from the findings of a single exploratory well that generated the wrong impression. In a sense, little harm has been done since every sensible investor treats the boasts of Aim-listed oil explorers with extreme scepticism. But everybody in this saga looks a little silly: Lenigas and the company; the broadcasters who didn\u2019t puncture the wild claims; and the London Stock Exchange that allowed the nonsense to run longer than necessary.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Britain\u2019s next government will face a tougher time than expected reducing Whitehall\u2019s annual spending deficit, according to the International Monetary Fund, which said lower tax receipts and uncertainty surrounding the election would undermine growth forecasts. The Washington-based organisation said the current prediction of a \u00a37bn surplus in the last year of the next parliament would instead be a \u00a37bn deficit. The forecast blows a hole in George Osborne\u2019s hopes that keeping to strict public spending limits for the next five years will deliver a surplus. The Office for Budget Responsibility, which uses Treasury figures to make its forecasts of the public finances, says the UK is due to reach a surplus by 2019 under current plans. But the IMF warned that its officials took a gloomier view of the UK\u2019s growth prospects over the next five years. Government spending may also need to be higher on welfare and tax credits than predicted by the OBR while the country gets back on track. \u201cOn the expenditure side, given uncertainties pertaining to the May elections, a slightly slower pace of consolidation than that in the [2015] budget is assumed for 2015/16 and beyond,\u201d it said. Earlier this week the IMF warned that the UK\u2019s stellar growth was due to slow from 2.7% this year to 2.3% in 2016. A judgment on the likelihood of a messy outcome to the election was behind that forecast, which it said would have knock-on effects for several years to come. The warning came as the IMF urged developed nations to capitalise on low oil prices by raising energy taxes and using the windfall to cut income taxes. It said the collapse in the oil price since last summer provided a chance to shift the burden of tax away from wages to help poorer workers left behind in the recovery. In its six-monthly monitor of government finances across member countries, the IMF said finance ministers should \u201cseize the opportunity created by falling oil prices\u201d to support initiatives that combat climate change and \u201cprovide breathing room for rebalancing the tax burden, for example, by lowering taxes on labour to boost employment\u201d. In addition, developing economies should reduce energy subsidies that keep the cost of petrol artificially low \u201cto provide space for productive spending on education, health and infrastructure, as well as for programmes to benefit the poor\u201d, the report said. The call from the IMF reflects growing concerns at an expected rise in greenhouse gas emissions now that energy consumption is cheaper. In the past five years the UK has seen falling emissions, largely as a result of a decline in economic activity brought on by high oil prices. Adding to the improving environmental picture, the AA has documented a sharp drop in road miles travelled by car drivers since the financial crash. Until recently that was thought to be a \u201cnew normal\u201d as motorists changed their habits, but campaigners fear that the 50% decline in oil prices will spark a return to old ways. The IMF has long been concerned about stagnation in wages across Europe, the US and much of the developing world. It sees the switch in taxes away from wages to energy as killing two birds with one stone. Unfortunately for green campaigners, recent experience in the UK, where the coalition government has frozen the duty on petrol in successive budgets, has shown the popularity of holding down the cost of fuel for transport. Low-income groups have also benefited from lower heating bills, while businesses have used lower fuel bills to cut transport costs. The promise of lower income taxes at the expense of a return to energy bills nearer the levels seen before the collapse in oil is likely to be met with voter scepticism. With most governments under pressure to reduce outstanding debts, there will be concern that the money will be diverted to support government spending before it is used cut income taxes. The IMF\u2019s warnings about the negative effects of the falling oil price could heighten these fears after it said the contribution of lower energy bills to inflation made it more difficult for governments to reduce debt levels. Vitor Gaspar, the IMF\u2019s head of fiscal policy, said that while the recovery was supported by lower oil prices, looser monetary policy and a relaxation of austerity measures in most countries, risks to government finances had grown since last year. Inflation reduces the value of outstanding debt and makes it easier for governments to finance. With inflation at zero across much of Europe, including the UK, debt levels remain stuck unless ministers can agree a budget surplus. The former Portuguese finance minister said: \u201cHigh public debt levels pose headwinds to growth. They also raise concerns about debt sustainability in some advanced economies. Furthermore, inflation is below target by a large margin in many countries. This makes the task of reducing high public debt levels more difficult.\u201d",

    "webTitle": "Protester disrupts European Central Bank press conference - as it happened", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "It\u2019s time for a closing summary. Mario Draghi\u2019s press conference in Frankfurt was dramatically disrupted today by an activist, in a protest against the European Central Bank\u2019s policies. In a remarkable security breach the protestor, understood to be Josephine Witt, leapt on the desk, showering glitter on the ECB president. She also threw leaflets condemning the \u201cundemocratic\u201d Bank, and its role in the financial crisis, and chanted \u201cEnd the ECB dictatorship\u201d repeatedly, before being removed by security staff. And there\u2019s a video clip here. The press conference was briefly suspended, before Draghi returned to tell reporters that his QE programme was delivering benefits to the eurozone economy, and to call for Europe\u2019s labour market to be reformed to help younger people. According to the ECB, Ms Witt registered as a journalist to attend today\u2019s press conference in the Bank\u2019s new Frankfurt headquarters. Staff took \u201cimmediate and effective action\u201d, it said in a statement. For example: Police confirmed that they arrested a 21-year-old woman at the scene; she was later released: Witt told Bloomberg tonight that she was motivated to protest against Draghi because he\u2019s never been elected. What\u2019s very concerning to me is that Mario Draghi as ECB president is not actually serving the societies, but imposing rules on them -- without ever being elected,\u201d the 21-year-old said. \u201cThis press conference is the little, little bit of democracy that the ECB gave us. I used this opportunity to express my criticism.\u201d It\u2019s the latest in a series of protests against the ECB since the financial crisis began; last month, anti-austerity protestors caused major disruption in Frankfurt. Once the drama was over, Draghi rebuffed concerns that the ECB\u2019s new QE stimulus programme might falter, for lack of eurozone debt to buy: \u201cNow the worries about potential scarcity of government bonds, sovereign bonds to be bought under our purchase programme are just a little exaggerated. We don\u2019t see problems. Both direct and indirect evidence and market feedbacks show that there isn\u2019t any problem and our programme is flexible enough in any event to be adjusted if circumstances were to change.\u201d And he also refused to countenance the idea that Greece might default: \u201cI don\u2019t even want to contemplate that. And based on the Greek government leaders\u2019 statements this option is not contemplated by themselves as well. So I\u2019m not ready to discuss any possible situation like that.\u201d But rating agency S&amp;P then raised the stakes tonight, by cutting Greece\u2019s credit rating deeper into junk. I\u2019ll be back tomorrow for another busy day of liveblogging, but probably one free of today\u2019s drama (right, Josephine?...) Thanks for reading and commenting, as ever. GW Ms Witt registered as a Vice reporter, according to the Telegraph: The economics correspondent Pete Spence explains her motives: Ms Witt said she would continue to engage in \u201chardcore activism\u201d in response to what she believed was an \u201cundemocratic\u201d ECB. She added that recent protests in Frankfurt during the opening of the ECB\u2019s new offices were a reaction to Mr Draghi\u2019s leadership. \u201c[He] never got a mandate, never got voted for or elected,\u201d she said. \u201cHe imposes policies on these societies that are completely undemocratic,\u201d she added. A friend of Ms Witt said she opposes what she describes as \u201cEuropean neo-liberalism\u201d, and argued that the ECB cannot act \u201cwithout a state of surveillance, of police and violence\u201d. If you squint at the photos taken earlier, you can see this is indeed the paper swirling around Mario Draghi\u2019s head. Protesters aren\u2019t usually verified on Twitter, so I can\u2019t confirm whether this actually is today\u2019s activist or not: #disclaimer While the credit rating downgrade isn\u2019t a surprise, Standard &amp; Poor\u2019s has some serious concerns over Greece. S&amp;P says Greece\u2019s economic state is \u201chighly uncertain\u201d, and warns that: \u201cwithout deep economic reform or further relief, we expect Greece\u2019s debt and other financial commitments will be unsustainable\u201d. Greece\u2019s solvency increasingly hinges on \u201cfavourable business, financial, and economic conditions\u201d, it adds. But despite the current problems, S&amp;P reckons the government will manage to continue to pay salaries,pensions in cash (rather than non-negotiable IOUs) despite \u201cweakening cash fiscal receipts\u201d. Breaking news: Greece\u2019s credit rating has just been cut by Standard &amp; Poor\u2019s, which also left the country on a negative outlook. Wonder what S&amp;P think of the ECB\u2019s security system... For those of you who haven\u2019t seen the protest already, this video captures the moment Mario Draghi\u2019s opening statement was dramatically disrupted Hopefully the ECB tighten up their security checks, before someone else pretends to be an economics hack. The European Central Bank has now issued a formal response: Statement on incident at ECB press conference The European Central Bank\u2019s press conference was briefly disrupted by a protester today, who jumped on to the stage and threw confetti. Staff from the ECB are investigating the incident. Security staff took immediate and effective action. Initial findings suggest that the activist registered as journalist for a news organisation she does not represent. Like all visitors to the ECB, she went through an identity check, metal detector and x-ray of her bag, before entering the building. ECB President Mario Draghi remained unharmed and calmly proceeded with the press conference.  Here is a copy of the paper thrown at Mario Draghi today, accusing the ECB of arrogance and creating human disasters through its policies (thanks to Pete Spence of the Telegraph). There is a Femen activist called Josephine Witt (short profile here), although the statement suggests it is an attack on austerity rather than the patriarchy. Today\u2019s incident feels unprecedented in financial circles; I can\u2019t recall any central bank protestor getting so close to their target before, especially inside the central bank\u2019s own headquarters. But it\u2019s not the first time the ECB has been a target. Last month, 350 people were arrested after protests disrupted the official opening of the new headquarters in Frankfurt, with several police cars set ablaze. And the ECB\u2019s decision to hold its monthly meeting in Barcelona in 2012 backfired, with thousands of police on the streets as protest marches took place. It\u2019s important to note that Draghi is completely unharmed -- not too surprising, given confetti doesn\u2019t pose much risk to human health. He certainly got off lighter than WTO Director-General Renato Ruggiero, who in 1999 was hit with cream pies by environmental protesters. Update: He\u2019s not a central banker, of course, but we shouldn\u2019t forget the attempt to \u2018pie\u2019 Rupert Murdoch in 2011 at the UK parliament. Frankfurt police say the protester is a 21-year old woman from Hamburg. She\u2019s currently being questioned. The FEMEN activist group have claimed responsibility for the protest. Femen have previously demonstrated against Vladimir Putin over the Ukraine conflict, and against former IMF chief Dominique Strauss-Kahn. Confirmation from Reuters: GERMAN POLICE SAY HAVE DETAINED WOMAN WHO DISRUPTED ECB NEWS CONFERENCE, SHE IS BEING QUESTIONED - RTRS The women who threw paper and confetti at Mario Draghi is now in custody in Frankfurt, according to Bloomberg. After the drama: And that\u2019s the end of the press conference. Unusually, there is a small ripple of applause -- which Mario Draghi says is \u201cvery comforting\u201d. A couple of people wander to the front to take photos, but Draghi\u2019s swiftly out of the room before there\u2019s any more drama. Finally, Draghi takes a question from a group of young people who won a competition to attend today\u2019s press conference. They ask for his views on the employment market today, and the prospects when they enter the labour market in a couple of years. Best question of the day, Draghi replies. The key to improving the eurozone\u2019s labour market is to eliminate \u201cduel market conditions\u201d, he says, so that young people have a fair change of getting employment. We must make it easier to hire people, cut the time people are unemployed, and change educational structure to make sure people have the right skills. That\u2019s the most important thing. Finally, a question about the protest. A journalists asks whether the European Central Bank president is OK, as he seems pretty calm. You\u2019ve answered your own question there, Draghi smiles back. He then returns to normal business, insisting that economic conditions are improving, and bank lending is improving. However, the recovery is reliant on the ECB sticking with its monetary policy measures. Clarification. Another photo just arrived, showing that the protestor was actually saying \u201cEnd the ECB Dick-Tatorship\u201d. A subtle difference. The European Central Bank says it is \u201cinvestigating\u201d today\u2019s protest: If you\u2019re just tuning in, you can watch Mario Draghi\u2019s press conference online here. He\u2019s now covering weighty monetary policy issues, and their role in underpinning the eurozone recovery. Amazingly, no-one has actually asked a question about the protest (\u201cAre you OK, Mr Draghi?\u201d might be a good place to start). The ECB chief says that the press conference will run for another 10 minutes to make up for the time lost when it was dramatically disrupted. Mario Draghi appears to be unshaken by the incident. He is now fielding questions about the eurozone. He says that he doesn\u2019t even want to contemplate the possibility that Greece might default on its debts. And he points to Spain as a success story, saying it is experiencing a \u201cstrong and employment rich recovery, supported by labour market reform\u201d. Bloomberg have uploaded a video clip too. It shows that the protester was shouting \u201cEnd the ECB dictatorship\u201d before being bundled out. Mario Draghi\u2019s opening statement is now online here (without any reference to the disruption) Here\u2019s Associated Press\u2019s early take on the protests: A female protester interrupted the European Central Bank\u2019s press conference on Wednesday, screaming \u201cEnd ECB dictatorship\u201d while she rushed the stage and threw what looked like confetti. The action happened as ECB President Mario Draghi was delivering opening remarks after the bank\u2019s latest policy meeting. Draghi reappeared on stage a few minutes later and carried on with his remarks. Some activists accuse the ECB of trying to enforce budget austerity measures on eurozone countries, such as Greece, that are under financial bailout programs. Here are photos of the moment that the European Central Bank\u2019s press conference was disrupted by a protester shouting \u201cend the ECB dictatorship.\u201d [see earlier blogpost onwards] It shows she threw paper and confetti at the head of the ECB, Mario Draghi, before being carried out of the room: Draghi has also played down concerns that the ECB\u2019s QE stimulus programme will struggle to find enough eurozone bonds to buy. Draghi is now taking questions from the media - no-one has asked if he\u2019s OK following the attack, though. Asked about Greece, he says that the ECB will support the Greek banks for as long as they are solvent. The ECB has now extended \u20ac110bn to the Greek financial sector, he adds. Draghi concluded his statement by warning that the eurozone needs more supply side measures to tackle its high structural unemployment &amp; low potential output growth. Draghi appears completely unruffled by the disruption, and has returned to his statement. He says the ECB is monitoring inflation closely, and still expects inflation to rise back towards its target in 2016 and 2017. Here\u2019s a better photo of the moment that Mario Draghi\u2019s press conference was dramatically disrupted a few moments ago. OK, we\u2019re back now -- Mario Draghi is unhurt, and he\u2019s continuing with his opening statement. A remarkable security breach, though -- this press conference is taking place inside the ECB\u2019s headquarters. It looks like the protestor threw confetti at the ECB chief. The protestor has been removed from the room, and the press conference has been suspended. Mario Draghi has then been dramatically cut off, as a woman rushed to the front press conference repeatedly shouting \u201cEnd ECB dictatorship. End ECB dictatorship\u201d* She also threw something at the ECB chief - which looked like paper. Mario Draghi starts cheerfully, saying he\u2019s \u201cvery pleased\u201d to welcome the media to the press conference. He confirms that the ECB began its stimulus programme as planned. It is proceeding smoothly. There is \u201cclear evidence\u201d that the policy measures we have put in place are effective, he declares. Borrowing conditions for firms and households have \u201cimproved notably\u201d. The press room in Frankfurt is nicely packed...and there\u2019s a burst of camera action as Draghi arrives. Angst breaking out across finance Twitter Umm no sign of Mario yet.... Maybe the lifts are broken again, like in January..... Mario Draghi\u2019s press conference is being streamed live, here. Reminder: we want to hear Mario Draghi\u2019s views on his QE programme, Greece, and the state of the eurozone, when the press conference starts in around 5 minutes. A quick recap. The European Central Bank has voted to leave eurozone interest rates at their current record lows. ECB president Mario Draghi will hold a press conference at 1.30pm BST (2.30pm Frankfurt), where he\u2019s expected to discuss the state of the eurozone economy and the early success of his QE programme. He may be asked whether the bond-buying programme could end early, if it\u2019s successful. European stock markets have hit their highest levels in 14 years, and the euro has fallen back, as investors prepare for this afternoon\u2019s ECB press conference. Traders are calculating that central banks will maintain accommodative monetary policy for some time, with the eurozone still in negative inflation and China\u2019s economy slowing. Nick Gartside, fund manager at JPM Global Bond Opportunities Fund, explains: Globally investors should bear in mind this is not the time to fight central banks. Powerful policies are forcing bond investors to sell bonds back to the central banks and redeploy those assets, and we cannot forget how much this supports risk assets.\u201d That\u2019s helped to drive the FTSE 100 to a new alltime high, over 7100 points for the first time. German bonds are hitting new highs, driving the interest rate on its 10-year bonds close to zero. It\u2019s been a worrying morning for Greece, though. Slovakia\u2019s finance minister has warned there is little chance of a deal to unlock aid next week, meaning: \u201cGreece is moving ever closer to the abyss.\u201d And new budget data has shown that Greece only achieved a primary surplus of 0.4% last year, well below target [details here]. The Kathimerini newspaper says this raises fresh fears over Greece\u2019s financial health. The budget figures show \u201cthat Greece needs external financing not just to meet redemptions but also to meet its current financing needs,\u201d said James Nixon, chief European economist at Oxford Economics in London. \u201cThere\u2019s very little appetite in Europe to extend significant lending to Greece, and so that means that effectively there will be a demand for renewed austerity and further fiscal tightening.\u201d It\u2019s official: The European Central Bank has voted to leave the key interest rates across the eurozone unchanged, at today\u2019s meeting. That means the benchmark rate remains at its lowest level ever, at 0.05%. Banks will still be charged 0.3% for overnight borrowing from the ECB, and hit with a negative interest rate of -0.2% for leaving cash in the ECB\u2019s vaults. ECB SAYS LEAVES BENCHMARK REFINANCING RATE UNCHANGED AT 0.05% ECB SAYS LEAVES INTEREST RATE ON MARGINAL LENDING UNCHANGED AT 0.30% ECB SAYS LEAVES INTEREST RATE ON DEPOSIT FACILITY UNCHANGED AT -0.20% Here\u2019s the statement. Now we must await Mario Draghi\u2019s press conference, in just under 45 minutes. Heads-up, the ECB is about to announce the decisions on monetary policy taken at today\u2019s meeting: Slovak finance minister Peter Kazimir has thrown cold water on hopes of a breakthrough in the Greek bailout talks next week. Speaking after a cabinet meeting in Bratislava, Kazimir warned that Greece is heading towards \u2018the abyss\u201d. Reuters has the details: \u201cGiven the we have lost a lot of time, I am sceptical,\u201d Kazimir told reporters after a Slovak cabinet meeting when asked if he believed the Riga meeting could bring a breakthrough. \u201cGreece is moving ever closer to the abyss.\u201d Kazimir is a member of the Eurogroup, which will meet next Friday in Riga. Greece hopes that this will unlock some aid (as we reported last night). However, German finance ministry spokesman Friederike von Tiesenhausen has just warned reporters in Berlin that talks are deadlocked: He also denied this morning\u2019s rumour that Germany was preparing for Greece to default. The damage suffered by the Greek economy in the last four years has been exposed by new fiscal data published by statistics body Elstat this morning. The figures confirm that Greece\u2019s GDP shrank from \u20ac207bn in 2011 to \u20ac170bn in 2014. And that means its national debt swelled from 171% of GDP to 177% GDP last year, despite the billions of Greek debt being written down in 2012 and heavy spending cuts. The report also shows that Greece posted a small primary surplus [ie, ignoring debt repayments] of 0.4% of GDP in 2014; much lower than the 2% estimated by the previous Greek government last October. The broader deficit was 3.5% of GDP, slightly above the 3% target set by Brussels. Today\u2019s antitrust charge against Google over its Shopping service could be just the start, says competition commissioner Margrethe Vestager. She\u2019s briefing reporters in Brussels now, explaining that other services are also under the Commission\u2019s microscope as it tries to ensure consumers aren\u2019t exploited. Vestager is also denying that there\u2019s an anti-American tinge to the probe. After five years of work, the European Commission has just hit Google with a charge that it abuses its dominant position in the search industry. The case relates to Google\u2019s shopping service; the EC says the search giant stifles competition by favouring its own pages. Brussels has also opened a separate investigation into Google\u2019s Android operating system. Competition chief Margrethe Vestager says: \u201cI have also launched a formal antitrust investigation of Google\u2019s conduct concerning mobile operating systems, apps and services. Smartphones, tablets and similar devices play an increasing role in many people\u2019s daily lives and I want to make sure the markets in this area can flourish without anticompetitive constraints imposed by any company.\u201d Antitrust: Commission sends Statement of Objections to Google on comparison shopping service; opens separate formal investigation on Android More to follow... The Eurozone Rumour Mill is grinding hard this morning, with Germany\u2019s Die Zeit newspaper claiming that Angela Merkel\u2019s government is preparing a plan to keep Greece inside the euro area even if it defaults. According to Die Zeit, Germany fears that Greece could soon miss a debt repayment, and could be prepared offer concessions if Athens can show its committed to reforms. The German government is declining to comment... The drop in short-term borrowing costs in the eurozone is truly remarkable, with only Greece missing out: The Greek government has cleared one, rather small, hurdle this morning by auctioning over \u20ac800m of three-month debt. This will cover the cost of repaying three-month bonds which mature soon. The debt was almost certainly bought by Greek banks, who will receive a yield of 2.7% [so Athens must pay much more to borrow until July than Berlin would pay to borrow until 2045] Update: German\u2019s ten-year government bonds just hit a new record high: GERMAN 10-YEAR BUND YIELD FALLS TO RECORD LOW BELOW 0.1291% Remarkable scenes in the bond markets today - German 30-year sovereign debt is changing hands at an effective interest rate of just 0.57%. German 10-year bunds are now yielding just 0.13%, meaning Berlin can borrow for basically nothing for the next decade. And eight-year bund yields turned negative yesterday, meaning they\u2019re worth more than their face value. We can thank Mario Draghi for this situation. Under the ECB\u2019s quantitative easing programme; it can buy bonds at negative yields as long as they\u2019re not below its own deposit rate of -0.2% (what it charges banks to leave funds in the ECB vaults). Traders are piling into eurozone bonds, confident that they can sell them to Frankfurt at a guaranteed profit. German two-year bond yields are already below this mark, at -0.27%. Some economists suggest the ECB may be forced to cut the deposit rate even lower, to find enough bonds to meet its QE targets. The Turkish lira isn\u2019t a pretty sight this morning -- it just hit a record low against the US dollar. Investors are getting jittery about June\u2019s general election, and the sustained pressure which president Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan is putting on Turkey\u2019s central bank. Erdogan has pushed hard for interest rate cuts to stimulate the economy, despite Turkey\u2019s inflation rate rising to 7.6% last month. His wider goal, if his AK party secures a sizeable victory in the election, is to rewrite Turkey\u2019s constitution to create a full-blown presidential system giving him a tighter grip on power [officially the presidency is a ceremonial role, but Erdogan, a former prime minister, has other ideas, putting him at odds with his successor]. Nour Al-Hammoury, chief market strategist at ADS Securities in Abu Dhabi, is also keen to hear about how Mario Draghi might end his stimulus programme: No one is expecting the ECB to change their policy, but questions will be asked about the length of the QE programme if European economies continue to grow more quickly than expected. Investors will want to know whether the ECB has revised its exit strategy. Mario Draghi could send the euro soaring if he gives any suggestion that his QE programme will be curtailed earlier than planned. Currently the ECB is committed to buying \u20ac60bn of government bonds, and other debt, per month until September 2016. But there is speculation that it could \u2018taper\u2019 the plan if it succeeds in driving inflation and growth. Ilya Spivak of DailyFX explains: \u201cThe Eurozone economy has shown some signs of life in recent months and the central bank chief will almost certainly have to field questions about the possibility that QE will be cut short if growth and inflation mend faster than expected. Rhetoric opening the door to such a possibility may be interpreted as a relative shift away from the ultra-dovish extreme on the policy outlook spectrum, boosting the Euro.\u201d The euro is currently worth $1.0607, close to its lowest level in 13 years. A weak single currency should help push inflation up, so Draghi is likely to dampen talk of tapering. The FTSE 100 has just nudged a new record high of 7102 points. High street chain Next is leading the way, up 2.3% after JP Morgan raised its price target. Tony Cross of Trustnet Direct says the Chinese slowdown is the big story in the City this morning: The big point of interest is the swathe of economic data we saw released from Beijing overnight \u2013 headline GDP was as expected at 7%, but a number of other readings fell short of expectations. However, rather than this initiating another rally for local markets, there\u2019s growing concern that Chinese stocks are in bubble territory and as a result many traders have remained sidelined. The Shanghai stock index has surged by a remarkable 28% this year, as retail investors pile into shares despite signs the economy is weakening. This kind of exuberance doesn\u2019t always ends well.... Here\u2019s your regular reminder of Greece\u2019s looming debt repayments, via Mike Bird of Business Insider. I was going to knock up a list of key points to watch out for from the ECB today.... but Bloomberg\u2019s Alessandro Speciale has already nailed it. Here\u2019s his list of five key points: Must we really start worrying about tapering? (might the ECB end its QE bond-buying programme earlier than planned, if it succeeds in stimulating the economy Are the March forecasts too optimistic? (minutes of the Bank\u2019s last meeting showed some policymakers doubt the forecast of inflation hitting 1.8% in 2017) Will the ECB find enough assets to buy? (some analysts suspect the pool of eurozone bonds could run dry as the QE programme mops them up) What is the latest on Greece? (will the ECB keep providing emergency funding if the April 24 deadline for a deal is missed?) Is there progress on structural reforms? (Draghi will surely repeat his regular plea to eurozone politicians not to slacken off) European stock markets are inching higher in early trading, as we await the ECB\u2019s press conference this afternoon. The FTSE 100 is up 10 points, with investors digesting the news overnight that China\u2019s economy grew at its slowest pace in six years. Chinese GDP expanded by an annual rate of 7% in the January-March quarter, according to government data, broadly in line with forecasts (and official targets). But the underlying picture is less healthy, as Reuters explains: Activity indicators, which are regarded as a more accurate picture of the economy, were all weaker in March than expected. Factory output climbed 5.6% in March from a year ago, below forecasts for a 6.9% gain. Most tellingly, China\u2019s power usage declined 3.7% compared with the previous year, the biggest drop since late 2008, when China\u2019s economy was hit by the global financial crisis. And that could mean more stimulus measures from Beijing..... There\u2019s an early selloff in Greek bonds this morning, despite the government claiming it will reach a deal with creditors next week. Traders have driven the yield (or interest rate) on 10-year Greek bonds over 12%, from 11.9% last night. Overnight, Bloomberg quoted an \u201cinternational official\u201d who said the two sides are not moving closer to a deal: The Greek government\u2019s refusal to proceed with any privatizations, and its pledges to reverse labor-market reform, pension reform and budget savings can\u2019t be accepted by the country\u2019s creditors, the official said, asking not to be named as talks between the two sides are not public. Brussels insiders have been consistently less optimistic than their Greek counterparts since this crisis began. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. The European Central Bank is top of the agenda today, as it holds its latest monetary policy committee meeting. No, don\u2019t adjust your calendars - it\u2019s not Thursday already; the ECB is gathering a day earlier than usual so Mario Draghi can jet off to Washington for the International Monetary Fund\u2019s Spring Meeting. We\u2019re not expecting any changes to eurozone interest rates (they can hardly go much lower, and it would be madness to raise them), so the real action comes at 1.30pm BST (2.30pm Frankfurt time) at Draghi\u2019s press conference. The ECB chief will be quizzed about his new QE bond-buying programme, which is giving the eurozone a much needed boost, and the state of the wider economy. Stan Shamu of IG suspects Draghi will sound upbeat: The press conference deserves some attention given Mario Draghi could make some positive commentary around signs of improvement in the economy. Draghi\u2019s views on the Greek crisis will also be worth hearing (as ever), as we tick towards another crunch deadline. The ECB is understood to have thrown Athens a small lifeline last night, by offering its banks another \u20ac800m in emergency funding. That takes the total liquidity available to \u20ac74bn; Reuters reckons there\u2019s around \u20ac4bn left. Greece continues to loom over the markets today, amid speculation that it won\u2019t reach a deal with its creditors at the next eurogroup meeting on 24 April. Last night, deputy foreign minister Euclid Tsakalotos rejected such talk, declaring: \u201cI am absolutely confident an agreement will be reached on 24 April. Deals are always done five or three or one minute before midnight, it\u2019s not unusual that they should go right to the brink.\u201d Or occasionally, right over the brink..... I\u2019ll be tracking all the main events through the day.",

      "bodyText": "Fears over the health of the world\u2019s two biggest economies have surfaced after weak industrial production data from the US followed evidence of a growth slowdown in China. Financial markets are betting on fresh stimulus from the People\u2019s Bank of China in Beijing and a delay in raising interest rates from the Federal Reserve in Washington after the downbeat news. US industrial production fell by 0.6% in March, a worse figure than Wall Street had been expecting even after allowances were made for a harsh winter. Chris Williamson, chief economist at financial data provider Markit, said the US was going through its softest growth patch since early 2009 when the economy was in the midst of its worst downturn since the Great Depression of the 1930s. \u201cIt\u2019s becoming increasingly clear that US economic growth slowed sharply in the opening quarter of the year,\u201d Williamson said. \u201cThis slowdown effectively kills off any chance of policy makers hiking interest rates in June, and adds to fears about the corporate outlook. Worries have intensified that, not only are lower oil prices damaging the energy sector, but also that the dollar\u2019s strength is acting as a drag on the economy, hitting overseas earnings in particular.\u201d Until recently, Wall Street had been braced for the Fed to start nudging up the cost of borrowing in June. But recent data has shown jobs growth and retail sales to be much less buoyant than anticipated. Rob Carnell, an economist at ING, said the latest New York Empire manufacturing survey, which came out shortly after the industrial production data, pointed to further weakness ahead. \u201cMarkets are no longer even talking about a June rate hike as a possibility. With data like this, it is not surprising. And if things don\u2019t shape up soon, then even September is going to look a hawkish call.\u201d Earlier, China announced that its economy grew by 7% in the first quarter of 2015, its lowest since the 6.6% recorded in the first three months of 2009. Analysts are divided over whether China is poised for a so-called hard landing as it seeks to rebalance its economy towards consumer-driven growth after the credit-fuelled, investment-led recovery for the recession of 2008-09. Amid some scepticism about the reliability of China\u2019s official economic data, Diana Choyleva of Lombard Street Research said she estimated that China had contracted by 0.2% between the fourth quarter of 2014 and the first quarter of 2015. Other analysts think China will avoid a hard landing. Even so, markets assume the Chinese central bank will cut interest rates and ease restrictions on bank lending in order to underpin growth.",

The South African insurer appointed Bruce Hemphill of Africa\u2019s Standard Bank to replace chief executive Julian Roberts later this year, prompting talk of a further break up of the business to focus on South Africa. Bernstein analysts said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Given Hemphill\u2019s extensive background in South (and sub-Saharan) African financial services, we think the appointment is well-aligned to the strategic outlook for the group. Old Mutual is currently described by management as being at an \u201cinflection point\u201d, between the restructuring/consolidation phase of its strategy, and the next phase, which is operational execution. And furthermore, Old Mutual is increasingly focused upon South Africa and sub-Saharan Africa (with the potential further spin-out of its US Asset Management business and/or IPO of its UK Wealth business likely to further increase this focus in our view).</p> <p>Hemphill appears well placed to take the group through this next phase, following the significant progress on stabilisation and re-focusing made by Julian Roberts since his appointment in 2008. Indeed, Hemphill\u2019s appointment may even see an acceleration of this re-focusing upon Africa. </p> </blockquote> <p>Among the mid-caps <strong>Virgin Money</strong> lost 22.1p to 399.9p on news that funds managed by US billionaire Wilbur Ross and Stanhope Investments sold 60m shares or 13.6% of the business at 400p a share.<br></p> <p><strong>Vesuvius</strong>, which makes ceramic moulds and linings for steelmakers and founderies, fell 30.1p to 470.4p, after JP Morgan Cazenove downgraded from overweight to neutral and Investec moved from add to hold on weak US steel production.

While productivity enhancement is still attractive for the group\u2019s steel and foundry customers, we have reduced our steel division revenue estimates by 4% (3% for the group) and assumed a 22% drop-through, reducing profits by 6-7%.

While the market has reacted strongly to the growing recovery story, we believe it has yet to fully grasp the scale of the potential returns of surplus cash to shareholders. We reiterate our buy for Greggs with a new 1300p share price target [from 980p] , implying 22% potential upside.</p> <p>Greggs is one year into a five year plan to transform itself from a high street baker to a bakery food-on-the-go operator with broad appeal in the attractive quick service sector. It\u2019s a strong self-help story where recovery is now firmly entrenched. We believe that all the ingredients are well mixed and baking together to ensure a sustained recovery in fortunes: over the next five years we forecast that Greggs will grow earnings per share by 11% compound annual growth rate, that free cashflow will grow by 27% to \u00a379m and return on invested capital will bounce-back to 19%, well above its weighted average cost of capital of 5.6%.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Tullow Oil </strong>added 32.2p to 400.8p on renewed talk it could be a bid target.

We see potential for 5-10m barrels a day of low-cost projects to move from E&amp;Ps/independents to majors/national oil companies, substituting less attractive developments. We upgrade Tullow Oil and Africa Oil to buy from neutral, believing that both offer exposure to strategic assets which sit low on the cost curve.</p> </blockquote> <p>Lower down the market <strong>Asian Citrus</strong> slumped 24% to 6.375p after it revealed it had discovered the presence of Huanglongbing or citrus greening disease at its Xinfeng Plantation in China.

Here are their comments, which we\u2019ll update throughout the day:</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2015/apr/15/fight-for-15-protest-workers-minimum-wage-live\">Fight for $15: workers across US protest to raise minimum wage \u2013 live</a> </p> </aside>  <h2>Jeremy Vela, an employee at Shakespeare &amp; Co. bookstore - Berkeley, California </h2> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We are an independent bookstore. You are not going to get rich working here; you do it because you enjoy it. <br></p> <p>It costs a lot to live here. I grew up in Berkeley and all the people I know don\u2019t live here anymore. $15 an hour will have a big impact on people who make the minimum wage. They will be able to buy better food and eat healthier.<br></p> </blockquote> <h2>Xander Kahle, an employee at Bear Basics gift shop - Berkeley, California<br></h2> <p>Kahle graduated from Berkeley last semester. He works 30 hours a week at Bear Basics, where he\u2019s currently making $10.50 an hour, just above the city\u2019s minimum wage. </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It\u2019d be great to raise the wage to $15. If you are trying to live off $10 an hour and you are not working 40 hours a week \u2013 well, it\u2019s impossible. The cost of living is high here. I live in a co-op and work 5-8 hours there a week, and the food is provided for. I can pull it off, but barely.</p> </blockquote> <h2>Karen Heisler, co-owner of Mission Pie bakery \u2013 San Francisco, California</h2> <p>San Francisco has a law to increase the minimum wage to $15 by 2018. It also requires employers with an employee pool of Mission Pie\u2019s size to pay $1.63 per hour per employee for healthcare. Heisler, who pays above minimum wage and offers her workers a 401(k), pointed out that the law doesn\u2019t address the pay disparity between the kitchen staff and the wait staff.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>My concern is that the minimum wage increase doesn\u2019t consider the disparity in businesses that have tips and commissioned employees. It\u2019s a pitiful aspect of the food industry that there\u2019s a pay hierarchy. I think it\u2019s hard for people to understand that.</p> <p>Our business is dedicated to proving high quality food at as low a price as we can, but we won\u2019t have room to achieve that. The most expensive meal on the menu is $8.50, a stew with vegetables and rice. Raising the minimum wage will have a huge impact, not this year but ultimately. It will probably require us to hire more experienced and skillful people. We will see a decrease in the number of businesses in the 20-employee range because it\u2019s becoming impossible to make it because of the cost of operation.</p> </blockquote> <h2>Becka Hare, a barista at Love coffee shop \u2013 Santa Monica, California</h2> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I don\u2019t think I\u2019d like to see minimum wage increase that much because labor cost is such a high expense for so many coffee shops and restaurants that I think the long term effect will be more detrimental.</p> </blockquote> <h2><strong>Jane McGinn, owner of Sweet Jane\u2019s frozen desserts \u2013 Astoria, New York</strong></h2> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>At this point, as a startup, it would put me out of business. It would also hurt my employees. Right now, my workers are all high school kids who are cutting their teeth on their first jobs. If the minimum wage went to $15, I would have to hire someone with management experience, which would take the kids out of the running.</p> <p>I don\u2019t think that entry-level jobs should be paid a minimum wage. We can\u2019t go that way without a major overhaul to the economy.</p> </blockquote> <h2>Marco Giannini, CEO of Protein For Pets \u2013 Los Angeles, California</h2> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We are actively planning for an increase over the next three years. We do have an advantage because we\u2019ve been around for less than two years and our systems have scalability and efficiency in mind. A company with older systems will have a more difficult approach. I think smaller store formats, such as Protein For Pets, and a decreased products offering is one way to tackle the issue. Also companies should look to outsourcing more technology and services.</p> </blockquote> <h2>Coffee shop owner \u2013 Venice, California</h2> <p>A Venice-based coffee shop owner, who asked to remain anonymous because she wished to avoid scrutiny from California\u2019s Employment Development Department, said that a minimum wage increase would shut down her business.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Labor is 30% of my overhead. A 50% increase in minimum wage would raise it to 45%. It\u2019s already tough to offer a business to the community and keep my head above water. Honestly, I\u2019d go under with that kind of increase. For most this is a first time job \u2013 they come to me with no experience. Others make tips which supplements their wage.</p> </blockquote> <h2><strong>Joy Lung, owner of TMJoy Boutique \u2013 Oakland, California</strong></h2> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>How do you help everyone make a decent living? But how do you evaluate what\u2019s an equitable wage? It\u2019s difficult. When I was doing landscaping design, I always paid above minimum wage. But here in clothing retail, people don\u2019t sweat or likely hurt themselves. There\u2019s a lot of down time. We pay different wages for different work, so we have to balance that. Other businesses that generate more revenues can better accommodate wage increases. Raising the minimum wage cuts into the profits, and it\u2019s a lot for a small business. </p> </blockquote> <h2><strong>Anna Reyes, employee at Burrito Express, a small burrito chain \u2013 Oakland, California</strong></h2> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I was already making over the minimum wage, so I got a $2 increase while others who were making less got more. Increasing the minimum wage is a good thing, but everything else is going up, too. So, are you better off? Small businesses like ours might have to cut hours. <br>  My goal is to have my own business one day. It\u2019s going to be expensive to run it if you raise the minimum wage. It seems like the more you make, the more you have to pay.<br></p> </blockquote> <h2><strong>Andrew Schiller, CEO of data company </strong><a href=\"http://www.locationinc.com/\"><strong>Location</strong></a><strong> \u2013 Worcester, Massachusetts</strong></h2> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>None of our employees are working for minimum wage. Even our part-time employees make 10-20% over more than the new proposed minimum wage. We believe in treating, and paying, our people well, and all we expect in return is for we expect them to appreciate how they are treated. We\u2019ve only had one person leave in six years.</p> <p>If the rise in minimum wage had a ripple effect that ended up pushing our hourly employees to ask for more money, I would hope they would look at the entire compensation package, flexibility in scheduling, frequent free lunches, the access to 401(k), casual environment and more, and think of the entire package that we provide as an employer.</p> </blockquote> <h2><strong>Aunt Mary\u2019s Caf\u00e9 \u2013 Oakland, California</strong></h2> <p>To raise wages to $15 an hour, Aunt Mary\u2019s Cafe instituted a 15% service charge, 60% of which goes to the servers while 40% to the kitchen crew.

Servers generally make $25-$35 an hour, including tips, while the cooks made around $15 before the new service charge went into effect.</p> <p>The service charge would be split among servers and cooks, which would give servers roughly the same income if they also get a 5% tip, but would mainly help to boost the cooks\u2019 pay to closer to $20, he said. </p> <p>\u201cWe support Oakland\u2019s minimum wage increase, and we are all trying to give the back of the house a wage increase,\u201d Stewart said.</p> <p>Starla Garvey, Aunt Mary\u2019s manager, said: \u201cI support raising the minimum wage. But the overhead cost has gone up because people in your supply chain have raised their prices in response to the new minimum wage. How can small businesses cover the cost? If we raise the minimum wage often, then we will soon be having $20 fried chicken.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe want to pay everybody as well as we can,\u201d Stewart said. \u201cIf you raise the wage, then you will have more career-oriented workers who want to stay on the job. </p> <p>What\u2019s the best way to achieve this?

There are 452 active volcanoes in the region and they are constantly studied to see which might be the next to erupt. Reading the International Monetary Fund\u2019s half-yearly global financial stability review feels like a similar exercise. Looking around the world, the experts at the IMF see billowing smoke emerging from the mountaintops and hear the ominous rumble of something getting ready to blow. A number of developments make the IMF uneasy. The global economy has not recovered the vigour it displayed before the great recession, despite the colossal stimulus provided by central banks and finance ministries. Indeed, the IMF\u2019s latest assessment is that the trend rate of growth in the global economy has slowed. Slower growth has been accompanied by extremely low inflation, and that has meant that even now, six years after the recession bottomed out in the spring of 2009, central banks keep delaying the moment at which they will start to remove the stimulus. Some, such as the European Central Bank, are actually providing additional support to growth. Add in the fact that the Fund failed to see the last crash coming and that, on average, there has been a financial crisis every seven years in the past three decades, and it is not hard to see why the skyline is being monitored with some anxiety. The warning should be heeded. On balance, the IMF thinks the next financial crisis is more likely to come from the developing rather than the developed world. The GFSR does have some concerns about developments in the west, citing the impact of negative bond yields on the viability of European life insurers. It raises an eyebrow at the still-high levels of personal debt in the UK, which will rise rather than fall on current projections from the Office for Budget Responsibility. But it has a number of specific concerns about the developing world. Firstly, a number of oil-producing countries look vulnerable following the halving of the price of crude in the second half of 2014. Secondly, the rapid and pronounced rise in the value of the dollar has driven down the value of currencies in the emerging world, exposing those companies that have borrowed in greenbacks to potentially damaging losses. Finally, there\u2019s the risk of a property crash in China, where the impact of the great recession was dampened by excessive credit growth that resulted in over-investment and a property bubble. The problem for the IMF\u2019s volcanologists is that despite having all the latest scientific equipment to monitor movements in the tectonic plates of the world economy, they don\u2019t really know when or where the next eruption will be. If the crisis happens in one of the emerging market countries identified \u2013 Brazil, Nigeria, South Africa or Argentina \u2013 there is a chance it will be a localised, if still painful, affair. If it is China, it will be another Krakatoa.",

      "bodyText": "Where in the world do you get the cheapest haircut or the cheapest weekend break? An annual survey from Deutsche Bank that compares purchasing power across countries, similar to the Economist\u2019s Big Mac index, found that shopping in Europe and Japan has become a lot cheaper in the past year, while India remains the cheapest major economy in the world. Australia is still the world\u2019s most expensive country while the US is the cheapest developed country, although the gap between the two has narrowed, according to the Mapping Prices survey, which compares the cost of various goods and services such as an iPhone, a pair of Levi\u2019s, taxi trips, tuition fees and health insurance. Deutsche\u2019s survey found that despite the stronger dollar, the US remains the cheapest place to buy an iPhone 6, for $650 (\u00a3440), which costs almost twice as much in Brazil, at $1,254. The US is also one of the cheapest places to buy a pair of Levi\u2019s 501 ($54 in New York) along with India ($34 in Mumbai) and Canada ($42.70 in Toronto). In Singapore ($103.30), Hong Kong and China, a pair costs around twice as much as in the US. Meanwhile, a pair of Adidas Super Star 2 trainers is cheapest in Brazil ($49.50), Japan ($62.50), South Africa ($68.90) and Mexico ($72.10). Germany is the most expensive place to buy a pair \u2013 even though Adidas is based in Herzogenaurach, Germany \u2013 along with France ($130). Head to India for the world\u2019s cheapest standard haircut for men: $2.40 in Delhi and $3.70 in Mumbai. Switzerland is at the other end of the scale: a haircut in Zurich will set you back $49.80. Singapore remains by far the most expensive place to buy a car, with a Volkswagen Golf costing $112,818, compared with $11,345 in Mumbai and $14,092 in Moscow. For watching a movie, try Mumbai ($3.80), Delhi ($4.50) and Kuala Lumpur ($4) but avoid Zurich ($19.70).

Michael Hewson at CMC Markets said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>While we aren\u2019t expecting any surprises just over one month in from the beginning of the ECB\u2019s quantitative easing program, the questions are already being asked as to whether the program will last into 2016.</p> <p> At last month\u2019s meeting in Cyprus [Draghi} was keen to talk up the success of his fledgling new easing program, despite the fact that most of the economic improvement being seen in the most recent data has been as a result of the lower oil price, and the decline of the euro, prior to the start of the program.</p> <p>Draghi\u2019s biggest problem now will be convincing those sceptics in the markets that it will still be needed if the economic data continues to improve, particularly given concerns about the rising increase in the number of negative yielding bonds, which could cause a shortfall in bonds for the ECB to buy, if it continues. </p> </blockquote> <p>China\u2019s first quarter GDP grew by 7%, in line with expectations but down from 7.3% in the previous three months. But industrial production came in much weaker than forecast, prompting speculation that China will introduce new stimulus measures to boost the economy, a prospect which is helping to support markets, especially the commodity companies.</p> <p>Investors seem to be surprisingly unconcerned about the prospect of Greece running out of cash despite the fact that a deadline to reach a deal with its eurozone creditors is fast approaching amid few signs the two sides are getting closer to agreement.</p> <p>Among the risers, <strong>Next </strong>has added 115p to \u00a372.25 after a positive note from JP Morgan Cazenove:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We upgrade our recommendation on Next to overweight from neutral, with a December 2015 target price of 7,700p. Although we continue to favour Marks &amp; Spencer on a 3-6 month view for its ongoing turnaround potential, we see scope for Next to recover some of its recent underperformance (13% year to date; 17% since Next\u2019s 2015 results) between now and its interim management statement on 29 April. We think that the more favourable weather since Next last updated the market on 19 March, assisted by the favourable UK consumer background, should have led to stronger trading in the second half of the first quarter of 2016.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Dixons Carphone </strong>has climbed 7.7p to 444.2p as it sold mobile virtual network company The Phone House Deutschland to German group Drillisch. Dixons will receive a 3% stake in Drillisch and a share of future cash flows.</p> <p>Still with retail, <strong>JD Sports Fashion </strong>has jumped more than 5% to 537p after a 22% rise in full year profits, helped by demand for trainers in the UK and Europe.</p> <p><strong>Weir</strong>, which supplies equipment to the oil industry, has added another 54p to \u00a319.34 as the crude price continues to rise - Brent is now up 1.4% at $59.25 a barrel. There was also some takeover speculation to add some spice.<br></p> <p><strong>AstraZeneca</strong> has added 69p to \u00a348.69 as the US Food and Drug Administration decided not to recommend any restrictions on prescribing its diabetes drug Onglyza.</p> <p>But <strong>Bunzl</strong> has dropped 40p to \u00a318.70 after a 6% rise in first quarter revenues and news of four acquisitions in Turkey, Canada and the Netherlands.</p>",

The FTSE 100 is currently up 30.06 points at 7105.32, with European markets also moving higher ahead of the latest European Central Bank meeting, where president Mario Draghi will give an update on its QE bond buying programme. Michael Hewson at CMC Markets said: While we aren\u2019t expecting any surprises just over one month in from the beginning of the ECB\u2019s quantitative easing program, the questions are already being asked as to whether the program will last into 2016. At last month\u2019s meeting in Cyprus [Draghi} was keen to talk up the success of his fledgling new easing program, despite the fact that most of the economic improvement being seen in the most recent data has been as a result of the lower oil price, and the decline of the euro, prior to the start of the program. Draghi\u2019s biggest problem now will be convincing those sceptics in the markets that it will still be needed if the economic data continues to improve, particularly given concerns about the rising increase in the number of negative yielding bonds, which could cause a shortfall in bonds for the ECB to buy, if it continues. China\u2019s first quarter GDP grew by 7%, in line with expectations but down from 7.3% in the previous three months. But industrial production came in much weaker than forecast, prompting speculation that China will introduce new stimulus measures to boost the economy, a prospect which is helping to support markets, especially the commodity companies. Investors seem to be surprisingly unconcerned about the prospect of Greece running out of cash despite the fact that a deadline to reach a deal with its eurozone creditors is fast approaching amid few signs the two sides are getting closer to agreement. Among the risers, Next has added 115p to \u00a372.25 after a positive note from JP Morgan Cazenove: We upgrade our recommendation on Next to overweight from neutral, with a December 2015 target price of 7,700p. Although we continue to favour Marks &amp; Spencer on a 3-6 month view for its ongoing turnaround potential, we see scope for Next to recover some of its recent underperformance (13% year to date; 17% since Next\u2019s 2015 results) between now and its interim management statement on 29 April. We think that the more favourable weather since Next last updated the market on 19 March, assisted by the favourable UK consumer background, should have led to stronger trading in the second half of the first quarter of 2016. Dixons Carphone has climbed 7.7p to 444.2p as it sold mobile virtual network company The Phone House Deutschland to German group Drillisch. Dixons will receive a 3% stake in Drillisch and a share of future cash flows. Still with retail, JD Sports Fashion has jumped more than 5% to 537p after a 22% rise in full year profits, helped by demand for trainers in the UK and Europe. Weir, which supplies equipment to the oil industry, has added another 54p to \u00a319.34 as the crude price continues to rise - Brent is now up 1.4% at $59.25 a barrel. There was also some takeover speculation to add some spice. AstraZeneca has added 69p to \u00a348.69 as the US Food and Drug Administration decided not to recommend any restrictions on prescribing its diabetes drug Onglyza. But Bunzl has dropped 40p to \u00a318.70 after a 6% rise in first quarter revenues and news of four acquisitions in Turkey, Canada and the Netherlands.",

    "webTitle": "Australia's economy: is the lucky country running out of luck?", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "After 24 years of uninterrupted economic growth, Australia is entering the kind of difficult waters experienced by every other major developed country in the past decade. Even if Thursday\u2019s unemployment figures show more jobs were added last month, the Coalition is set to go into the next election with an unusually gloomy outlook. Australians are finding it harder to get a job than at any time in more than decade and those who are in work are seeing the weakest wage growth for two decades. There are even fears that taxes might have to go up to cover a $25bn budget black hole caused by falling commodity prices. As one leading economist put it, the lucky country is running out of luck. Growth is still on target for a healthy at 2.8% for this year, according to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the kind of number that would send European leaders scrambling for the tweet button. But the question of whether Australia loses its remarkable record of continuous growth depends, as with almost everything else in the economy, on what happens in China. \u201cAustralia has gone 24 years without a recession thanks to good management and good luck,\u201d said Saul Eslake, the chief economist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch in Sydney. \u201cUp to the early 2000s it was managed well and then it wasn\u2019t. But then the luck improved because of China\u2019s huge stimulus after the global financial crisis. Now the luck is running out.\u201d The slowdown in the world\u2019s second biggest economy is now well and truly underway. Demand for Australia\u2019s iron ore and coal has plummeted from a decade ago as Beijing seeks to scale back its huge building schemes and create a more consumer-led economy. The price of the steel-making commodity, Australia\u2019s biggest export, has fallen from $130 at the start of 2014 to around $50. Coal has halved in price in the past four years. Buoyed by the good times, resource companies led by BHP Billiton and Rio Tinto launched a huge expansion which saw mining investment as a percentage of the Australian economy peak at a whopping 7% in 2012. The new output from their giant mines in Western Australia is now hitting the market, making export figures look healthy but adding to the pressure on prices and leaving Australia with a potentially wretched hangover. Unemployment is now at 6.3% \u2013 the highest rate for 13 years \u2013 and wages are lagging inflation. \u201cAustralia is the only major developing country where unemployment is rising,\u201d says Eslake. \u201cIt\u2019s falling in the UK, the US and even in Europe, where it is high, it is starting to come down. That is nearly all due to the fact that the income-generating machine in China has been switched off. Australia is coming back to the rest of the world.\u201d As a result, there\u2019s another headwind on the demand side. \u201cReal wage growth is doing nothing,\u201d says James Glenn, senior economist at National Australia Bank. \u201cOur surveys show people are nervous. They don\u2019t want to spend so instead they\u2019re paying down debts and reining in discretionary spending.\u201d The way forward for Australia is not entirely clear but it will have to involve new markets and job growth in different sectors. A weaker dollar will help. At parity with the greenback two years ago, the Australian currency now buys US76c, which should help exporters. Manufacturing would once have stepped up to the plate. But Australia\u2019s factories are struggling to compete in the global marketplace, as evidenced by the planned shutdown of carmakers Ford, Holden (part of General Motors) and Toyota in quick succession with the loss of thousands of well-paid jobs. In Geelong, an industrial city west of Melbourne, Ford has just about packed everything into the boot and is ready to drive off, leaving a skeleton testing and design staff. Rob Hamilton, owner of Rob Hamilton Bearings, says the city has been hit hard by the shrinking of the auto industry but also by the closure of the Alcoa aluminium smelter last year. \u201cThere\u2019s high youth unemployment because people aren\u2019t qualified. The old manual, non-skilled jobs are not being replaced,\u201d he said, reflecting fears that the manufacturing sector will not easily respond to the challenge. But despite a noticeable downturn when Alcoa closed with the loss of 1,000 jobs and lots of service contracts for outside businesses, Hamilton senses that belief is coming back, a feeling borne out by an upturn in confidence in March. \u201cIt certainly has had an effect on the town. But it\u2019s been reasonably good this year, up on the same time last year. I think people thought it was doomsday and they put away the order books. But now they can see that life\u2019s going on and things are going along better.\u201d Some believe the country\u2019s soaring housing market \u2013 prices are up nearly 15% in Sydney in the past 12 months \u2013 is a sign that the luck hasn\u2019t run out just yet. Chinese investors are credited with boosting the sector and construction is set to rise sharply in the next few years, helped by record low interest rates of 2.25%. Another cut is likely before treasurer Joe Hockey delivers his budget on 12 May. Optimists also point to a local share market, which has benefited from the strong dollar as investors pumped cash into Australia\u2019s large and profitable banks. But with house prices beyond the reach of young professionals and the financial sector making up almost half of the valuation of the stock market at a time when many other businesses are on their knees, it could be time to look for another way forward. Agriculture might be one. Australia has the second most efficient farmers in the world \u2013 after dairy world champions New Zealand \u2013 and the government is pushing hard for the sector to be both the granary and the larder to cater for the changing tastes of Asia\u2019s growing middle classes. Services such as tourism, banking and wealth management and also education, which attracts large numbers of Asian students, are also possible growth areas for the future. Glenn identifies tourism as a clear winner from a lower dollar as visitors get more for their cash and Australians holiday at home, and also nominates the political push for new frontiers. \u201cFree trade agreements will definitely help to open up new markets in China, but it won\u2019t happen overnight,\u201d he says. The other problem is that everybody else has got the same idea. Building markets in food and services is, as Eslake points out, a far more competitive field than mining in which Australia had a huge natural advantage. \u201cNew Zealand, the US, Canada, Latin America, Europe and even Ukraine can all supply food to China so we have to manage it better ... and we need more capital and that means more foreign investment,\u201d he says. \u201cAustralia has had 20 years the like of which we\u2019ll never see again. But it\u2019s going to get harder now.\u201d",
