      "bodyText": "The creator of the Big Mac, one of the most popular fast foods in the world, has died aged 98. Jim Delligatti was a McDonald\u2019s franchisee who came up with the idea in 1967 because he said customers wanted a bigger sandwich. His invention was almost rejected by McDonald\u2019s, which was happy that its traditional meals \u2013 a hamburger, fries and a milkshake \u2013 were selling well. The firm relented, but while it says it has since sold billions of the sandwiches, it admits Delligatti never received a penny in royalties. The McDonald\u2019s franchisee, whose full name was Michael James Delligatti, invented the burger while running his restaurant in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. He was later said to have eaten at least one Big Mac every week for decades. \u201cI would never have dreamed that my creation would turn into a piece of Americana,\u201d the company quoted Delligatti as saying. Delligatti told the Associated Press in 2006 that his idea almost never got off the ground. \u201c[McDonald\u2019s] figured, why go to something else if [the original menu] was working so well?\u201d When the burger turned 40, McDonald\u2019s estimated it was selling 550m Big Macs a year. The company has said it did not pay Delligatti royalties for it but declined to say why when asked by the Guardian. In a 2005 interview with the Pittsburgh Tribune-Review, since removed from its site but still available in online archives, Delligatti joked that he received a \u201cdollar apiece\u201d on the global sales, before telling his interviewer: \u201cNo, honey. I don\u2019t get anything. I\u2019d love to have a tenth of a cent.\u201d His son, also named Michael, told AP his father was often asked why he named it the Big Mac, and he said it was because \u201cBig Mc sounded too funny\u201d. In a statement released through McDonald\u2019s, Delligatti\u2019s family said he was a \u201cspirited and generous philanthropist\u201d who helped refugee families get treatment for their children. He also supported various other charities. During the second world war, Delligatti served as a sergeant in the US army in Europe. McDonald\u2019s paid tribute to Delligatti, calling him a \u201clegendary franchisee\u201d who made a \u201clasting impression\u201d. Delligatti died at his Pittsburgh home on Monday, his family said. In addition to his two sons, he is survived by his wife, Ellie, five grandchildren and eight great-grandchildren.",

      "bodyText": "Given how it dominates Australian political economic debate, it is perfectly apt that the biggest impact of the election of Donald Trump is on interest rates. But whether his impact will be real rather than just a change in market expectations remains to be seen. Predicting interest rates can make mugs of both commentators and investors. Prior to the US presidential election, the market was predicting a one in three chance of a cut in the cash rate to 1.25% by August next year; now there is around a two in three chance of a rise to 1.75%: Nothing about Australia\u2019s economic conditions has changed. Yes, commodity prices have improved a bit, but they have also been quite volatile. There\u2019s no suggestion of the economy firing up \u2013 indeed some economists suggest it has slowed and that growth for 2017 will be closer to 2% than 3%. So why the change? Trump. For all the very real concerns about corruption in a Trump presidency, it\u2019s tougher to get a forecast on what impact he will have on the economy. Trump\u2019s two main economic policies are for large tax cuts \u2013 both for companies and for high income earners \u2013 and for a $1tn infrastructure spend. Both of these plans would increase the size of the US budget deficit and are thus, in a pretty standard Keynesian economic sense, expansionary. It\u2019s not a great surprise that this week the OECD suggested that these plans mean that economic growth in the USA \u201cis set to strengthen in 2017 and 2018\u201d due to the \u201cassumed fiscal stimulus boosts\u201d to the economy. The biggest short-term impact of such a plan is that it would increase inflation, and this was reflected immediately in the increase in the US treasury 10-year bond yields, which rose once it became clear Trump had both won, and was able to deliver a victory speech that didn\u2019t suggest he was about to institute a military dictatorship: The increase in bond yields reflects investors\u2019 belief that inflation will increase in the mid-long term and thus they are seeking a higher rate of return. And because Australia\u2019s bond yields largely follow the lead of the USA\u2019s, Australia\u2019s bond yields also rose. And the implications of this are clear \u2013 the cost for the Australian government to borrow money has increased quite markedly in the past month. Back on 24 August, when bond rates were at their lowest, the government borrowed $1bn for 11 years at a rate of 1.9459%. By 21 September, when it borrowed $900m for 11 years it had to pay an interest rate of 2.1936% \u2013 still historically low. By 2 November, when Hillary Clinton was still heavily favoured to win the election, the government borrowed $1bn for 11 years at a rate of 2.4189%. The Trump victory saw a sharp rise in the rate the government had to pay. On 11 November it borrowed another $1bn this time for 12 years, but now at a rate of 2.7005%, and last week when it borrowed $900m for 12 years the rate was up to 2.8136%. Now we shouldn\u2019t get too excited. Bond yields remain at a historically low level: But the change does have implications for the budget deficit (the budget estimates $16.6bn will be spent on government debt interest payments) and also for home owners\u2019 mortgage payments. Government bond yields are often good indicators of where the cash rate will head: The problem is all of this largely has nothing to do with Australia, where there has not been any big increase in inflation expectations. A good quick and dirty measure of inflation expectations is to look at the difference between the 10-year bond yields and the inflation-indexed bond yields. While the difference has increased since the middle of the year \u2013 indicating an increase in the expectations for inflation since then \u2013 there has actually been little change since Trump\u2019s victory: It would appear the drive for higher interest rates is thus all via events in the USA, rather than anything to do with our economy. And the problem is right now everyone is just guessing about what will happen under a Trump presidency. Yes, he might instigate a $1tn infrastructure spend. But a close look at what he is proposing suggests the spend will be more about tax breaks for companies on projects which are considered profitable and likely to go ahead regardless than it is for investing in works that would create jobs or improve crucial infrastructure such as water systems, rural bridges and roads. And while spending $1tn on infrastructure \u2013 no matter how poorly targeted that spend may be \u2013 should provide some stimulus to the economy, it is unclear how the Republican party-led Congress will react. While they appear suddenly less concerned about government debt than they were prior to election day, it would not be surprising if the money spent on Trump\u2019s big vote-grabbing $1tn infrastructure resulted in cutbacks in government services elsewhere. Thus the impact of the infrastructure spend might not be as inflationary as is currently being expected because it is both poorly targeted, geared more towards company profits than economic activity and offset by reduced spending elsewhere. So while right now, due mostly to the unexpected election result, the market is predicting big changes to the USA\u2019s economy, there has undoubtedly been a bit of an over-reaction. While for now it appears the impact is to signal the end of interest rate cuts in Australia, we should always remember the market can get it wrong. Twelve months ago the market was barely even expecting a rate of 1.75% let alone the current rate of 1.5%:",

      "bodyText": "Katie Allen poses three crucial questions on how to improve Britain\u2019s productivity (The road to greater productivity is via pay and flexibility, 28 November). Namely how it links in with low pay, how it interacts with working hours, and what it tells us about the importance of staff taking ownership of their work. I have put a proposal to the government that sets out to cover each of these points. I have proposed a network of public employment services, driven locally by Jobcentre Plus and sustained by City Deal funding, with the specific aim of helping low-paid workers to climb the earnings ladder and craft their jobs to match their skills and circumstances. Its main benefit to workers would be the provision by a dedicated caseworker of information, advice and guidance, as part of a clear and agreed contract which is aimed at helping them earn more money and improve their working lives \u2013 be it through altering their hours, negotiating a pay increase, taking advantage of local childcare services or discounts on public transport, gaining specialist skills, or finding work elsewhere for which their circumstances are better suited. The government\u2019s own in-work service is currently being piloted among a limited group of universal credit claimants only. To help solve the productivity puzzle in which our country finds itself, a more comprehensive offer is required to help change the nature of low-paid work. Frank Field MP Labour, Birkenhead \u2022 Philip Hammond says that in the real world a German worker takes four days to make what we make in five. This is a heavy burden to put on to a metric that is just one big number (GDP) divided by another (workers). It is like saying that people have on average 1.99 legs, ie technically true perhaps, but quite hard to find an example and not very helpful. Given the same tools and the same task, I\u2019m sure a British worker is just as productive as a German one. What brings our average productivity down is a higher proportion of people in low-paid work, and a long-term failure to invest in capital equipment. Proper sectoral analysis is required, not eye-catching headlines which just make us feel inadequate to the modern world. Whether it is right to reward the worker for making more widgets by using a better machine is a different question \u2013 perhaps the return on capital should go to the business owner. But while you can always mothball an underperforming factory, at a national level you can\u2019t just mothball a workforce. Even Henry Ford knew he needed paying customers to buy his cars. Tim Grollman London \u2022 Productivity in the UK car industry matches or exceeds the best elsewhere in Europe. Productivity while selecting parcels in a warehouse would be much lower due to the large number of people employed on zero-hours contracts, which will still have to be taken into account when calculating productivity. Crudely average the two and you have a misleading view of the UK economy. Only by analysing the economy sector by sector will we identify where attention is needed, either by better training or legislation to outlaw poor employment practices. Richard Bull Woodbridge, Suffolk \u2022 Gaby Hinsliff is wrong (The golden generation should enjoy the luxury of being useful while it can, 25 November). Many retired people wonder how they ever had time for work. I recall that, over 30 years ago, predictions of a \u201cleisured age\u201d led to the view that society should prepare for a reduced working week. Recent articles (eg Just about managing? In these towns that\u2019s a dream, Aditya Chakrabortty, 22 November) and diminishing opportunities for even skilled work suggest, in respect of work, the predictions were correct. Yet there is increased necessity for employment. Both partners in a family work to make ends meet, pension age is increasing, people resort to spurious \u201cself-employment\u201d, and graduates undertake unpaid internships. What went wrong? The cause is concentration of the benefit from automation into the hands of the elite. Business heads\u2019 rewards are disproportionate to their workforce. Shared more equally, the need for full-time work should diminish. Equalisation in pay levels, coupled with redistributive taxes, could allow provision of a basic income sufficient to permit a shorter working week. The old-age pension could disappear. Anyone could continue working at occupations they enjoy, or which are their own rewards, but financial reward should not be the principal stimulus for any undertaking. Pay differentials and \u201ccapitalist\u201d methods of earning could remain, but rewards would be appropriately taxed so that no one was forced into full-time employment. What creativity might be unleashed. Utopian? Perhaps, but to avoid the conflict predicted by George Monbiot (Trump\u2019s climate denial is just one of the forces that point us towards war, 23 November) we must reverse the present \u201csurvival of the richest\u201d and reduce the need to work in order to live. Ian King Westbury-on-Severn, Gloucestershire \u2022 In the 1970s there was considerable discussion about what society should do to cater for all the \u201cleisure time\u201d that would arise when repetitive processes were automated and made more efficient. However, in that age of the welfare state and fairer taxation it was assumed that the benefits of automation would be to a significant extent shared. However, along came Thatcher and Reagan with authoritarian monetarist economics (which in an Orwellian misuse of language is now referred to as \u201cliberal economics\u201d), and in particular the tax race to the bottom so that, as technological advance means we have become much more efficient at producing the goods and food we need, the benefits have been retained by an ever decreasing minority, while the incomes of the majority have stagnated, or even regressed, for the last 40 years. With an ever smaller workforce required to produce the products we need, unless we can reverse the trend back to redistributive taxation, and accept that not everyone can contribute directly to material wealth creation (but still want and need a good share of that wealth), I think George Monbiot\u2019s prediction that we are heading towards major conflict is almost inevitable. Graham Dean Wellington, Somerset \u2022 If there is going to be less employment in those areas where robots will replace manpower, can someone explain our governments\u2019 arguments for more immigrants to do \u201cthe jobs we don\u2019t want to do\u201d. There is a contradiction here. If this doomsday theory is right, encouraging the arrival of immigrants from other parts of the world can only lead to a nightmare scenario of more people turning to extremist parties, social problems and social unrest when jobs and homes go.

      "bodyText": "Just after the chancellor\u2019s autumn statement, Conservative Jacob Rees-Mogg had rubbished the Office for Budget Responsibility for making unnecessarily gloomy predictions about the government\u2019s handling of Brexit and suggested we would all soon be dancing towards fun-filled days of forever summer. A lot can change within a week. Not least that it now appears the OBR was a ray of sunshine compared with almost every other economic forecaster. So when Rees-Mogg got to meet the OBR chairman, Robert Chote, face to face at the Treasury select committee, he was rather more temperate than he had previously been. The OBR had done its work very properly, he observed, the model of noble politesse. It was just completely incorrect in its findings. How could the OBR be so certain about the levels of uncertainty? Chote raised an eyebrow. He had expected to be grilled on the numbers rather than metaphysics and ontology. \u201cThe thing about uncertainty is that it\u2019s uncertain,\u201d he said certainly. It was now Rees-Mogg\u2019s turn to look puzzled. Chote tried to help him out. It was like this: though he couldn\u2019t be quite as certain about the levels of uncertainty as the Bank of England, he was still certain enough about the uncertainty to be confident in the uncertainty. Or to put it another way, uncertainty + uncertainty = certainty. \u201cWe\u2019ve had to make some assumptions based on government policy even though we and the government know that some policies are never going to be implemented,\u201d said Chote. \u201cOn other matters we asked the government to explain its policies but they didn\u2019t seem to have any.\u201d Rees-Mogg still wasn\u2019t entirely happy with what he was hearing. Wasn\u2019t it possible that all the forecasters were wrong and that Britain wouldn\u2019t be considerably more broke for the next 10 years? Chote looked up, searching for a flying pig. \u201cThe government may hope that,\u201d he said. \u201cBut by the time that happens I will be retired and you will be in the Lords.\u201d Of that he was certain. The committee\u2019s chair, Andrew Tyrie, was keen to explore the meaning of uncertainty in greater depth. What created the most uncertainty? The government setting a date for leaving the EU in March next year, or it doing so without having a clue of where it was going to end up two years down the line? Chote chose to pass on this. This was a level of uncertainty well above his pay grade. \u201cI think,\u201d he said, choosing his words carefully, \u201cthat nothing will be agreed until everything has been agreed.\u201d With the big existential questions of Brexit left hanging in the air, Tyrie turned towards more mundane existential matters. Such as the Treasury\u2019s assurances that there were no contingent liabilities to the Nissan deal. Was Chote any more certain about these uncertainties now that Philip Hammond had sent him a personal billet-doux? \u201cNo,\u201d said Chote. \u201cThe thing is that the Treasury only said that the Department for Business didn\u2019t think there were any liabilities and refused to say what it thought, so I\u2019m still certain that I\u2019m uncertain.\u201d Chote went on to point out that \u201ceven under the yoke of EU rules\u201d the Germans managed to export three times as much to China as we did and that the cost of Brexit was likely to be about \u00a312bn per year. Labour\u2019s Rachel Reeves invited him to think of any possible economic upsides to Brexit. Chote thought about this for a while. \u201cI suppose if we returned to agricultural support, dropped to their pre-1973 levels, then food prices might be lower,\u201d he offered. Over the farmers\u2019 dead bodies. Faced with such a deluge of negative certainties, Conservative Stephen Hammond desperately tried to find some uncertainties in the autumn statement that might be positive. \u201cDo you have any confidence in the chancellor\u2019s assertion that there will be a clear and strong effect on investment?\u201d he asked. \u201cNot really,\u201d said Chote. \u201cBecause the effect will be so small.\u201d \u201cBut it will be strong and clear,\u201d Hammond said hopefully. \u201cStrong, clear and small.\u201d Chote was doing his best to throw him a bone. \u201cSmall,\u201d Hammond repeated. \u201cThe chancellor must have left that bit out.\u201d",

Chote looked up, searching for a flying pig. \u201cThe government may hope that,\u201d he said. \u201cBut by the time that happens I will be retired and you will be in the Lords.\u201d Of that he was certain.</p> <p>The committee\u2019s chair, Andrew Tyrie, was keen to explore the meaning of uncertainty in greater depth. What created the most uncertainty? The government setting a date for leaving the EU in March next year, or it doing so without having a clue of where it was going to end up two years down the line? Chote chose to pass on this. This was a level of uncertainty well above his pay grade. \u201cI think,\u201d he said, choosing his words carefully, \u201cthat nothing will be agreed until everything has been agreed.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/nov/24/brexiteers-office-for-budget-responsibility\">Brexiteers will trash anyone who gets in their way | Martin Kettle</a> </p> </aside>  <p>With the big existential questions of Brexit left hanging in the air, Tyrie turned towards more mundane existential matters. Such as the Treasury\u2019s assurances that there were no contingent liabilities to the Nissan deal. Was Chote any more certain about these uncertainties now that Philip Hammond had sent him a personal billet-doux? \u201cNo,\u201d said Chote. \u201cThe thing is that the Treasury only said that the Department for Business didn\u2019t think there were any liabilities and refused to say what it thought, so I\u2019m still certain that I\u2019m uncertain.\u201d</p> <p>Chote went on to point out that \u201ceven under the yoke of EU rules\u201d the Germans managed to export three times as much to China as we did and that the cost of Brexit was likely to be about \u00a312bn per year. Labour\u2019s Rachel Reeves invited him to think of any possible economic upsides to Brexit. Chote thought about this for a while. \u201cI suppose if we returned to agricultural support, dropped to their pre-1973 levels, then food prices might be lower,\u201d he offered. Over the farmers\u2019 dead bodies.</p> <p>Faced with such a deluge of negative certainties, Conservative Stephen Hammond desperately tried to find some uncertainties in the autumn statement that might be positive. \u201cDo you have any confidence in the chancellor\u2019s assertion that there will be a clear and strong effect on investment?\u201d he asked.</p> <p>\u201cNot really,\u201d said Chote. \u201cBecause the effect will be so small.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut it will be strong and clear,\u201d Hammond said hopefully.</p> <p>\u201cStrong, clear and small.\u201d Chote was doing his best to throw him a bone.</p> <p>\u201cSmall,\u201d Hammond repeated. \u201cThe chancellor must have left that bit out.\u201d</p>",

Now the 14 members \u2013 soon to be reduced to 13 as Indonesia sits out for a while \u2013 have agreed that 1.2m barrels a day will be removed, a reduction in Opec\u2019s volumes of about 4.5%. It\u2019s a \u201chistoric moment\u201d, says the organisation. In a sense, it is. Opec hasn\u2019t managed such a display of unity since 2008. Regional rivals Saudi Arabia and Iran have found a way to share the burden of lower production, which is a significant development if it lasts. The oil price rose 8% to $50 a barrel. But it is usually wise to take Opec\u2019s grand statements with a pinch of salt. There are several reasons to do so this time. First, the deal depends on non-Opec members removing 600,000 barrels a day of their own production. Russia, said Opec, is good for half that tally. But enforcing compliance, which is Opec\u2019s traditional problem, is harder when you are attempting to corral non-members. Relying on Russia could be a slippery game. Second, the supposed display of strength requires context. It has happened only because Opec\u2019s previous \u201ckeep pumping\u201d strategy, dictated by the Saudis, failed. The aim was to bring the US shale oil industry to its knees. Instead, the US industry cut costs and learned to live with $50 a barrel. A sub-$40 price, if sustained over many years, could have worked. But the Saudis, facing an enormous budget deficit, have blinked first. Third, what matters now is how long the new quotas stay in place. If the oil price climbs upwards towards $60, happy harmony is possible \u2013 the production cuts would have worked. But there is no fundamental shortage of oil supplies in the world, at least at the global economy\u2019s current rate of growth. If the price slips back towards $40, Opec\u2019s internal political squabbles will return. Judge the deal six or nine months from now. The cartel is alive, but we don\u2019t know how hard it can still kick. Brexit: lost in transition Mark Carney is right. It matters that the UK is \u201ceffectively the investment banker for Europe.\u201d Continental firms would suffer if the eurozone tries to upend the City of London at the moment of Brexit. An orderly transition, in the negotiating jargon, is in everybody\u2019s interests. It could hardly be otherwise when you consider the statistics in the Bank of England\u2019s annual financial stability report. Banks located in the UK are involved in over half the debt and equity issuance by non-UK borrowers in the European Union. Over three-quarters of the EU\u2019s trading in foreign exchange and over-the-counter interest rate derivatives takes place in the UK. Financial activity of that size does not shift easily, if at all. It\u2019s not as if Italian banks, for example, are remotely equipped to deal with a sudden increase in demand to underwrite risk derivatives. The danger in sudden rupture is that the cost of capital for big corporate borrowers rises across the eurozone, which would be a almighty own-goal by the EU 27. Energy costs are higher in Europe in the US. Why impose higher financial costs on top? One suspects even those eurozone politicians who are irate about Brexit, when pressed in private, would accept the need for a smooth transition that covers banks\u2019 passporting rights and so on. The tricky part is making it happen. A safe transition period for the European banking and financial system might have to last half a decade. The political rhetoric, on both sides, is a very long way from that position. Bad year at the office for RBS Another year, another wooden spoon for Royal Bank of Scotland. And this time it was a fail, rather than a scrappy pass, in the Bank of England\u2019s annual stress tests on banks. The tests were stiffer this time and RBS can rustle up the required \u00a32bn in capital by cutting costs and shedding more assets, so it would be wrong to conclude that there is any fresh crisis. It is still, for the most part, the old crisis. The biggest element is the looming fine for mis-selling mortgage securities in the US in the pre-crash years. The fine could be anywhere between $4bn and $14bn. Nobody knows, but an extreme outcome, in either direction, would obviously make a big difference to the bank\u2019s capital position. Why is RBS still waiting to be walloped? Because the US authorities move shockingly slowly and never explain why.",

The chancellor said promises made to the Japanese firm avoided weighing down the Treasury with significant extra subsidies in the wake of the Brexit vote. However, in a letter to an influential all-party committee, Hammond refused to say how much the commitments made to Nissan would add to the public finances, saying only that any subsidies were \u201centirely within state aid and WTO rules\u201d. Hammond said in a letter to Andrew Tyrie, the chair of the Treasury select committee, that \u201cno new contingent liabilities have been created in respect of government reassurances provided to Nissan\u201d. Hammond added: \u201cIn any case, we expect any commitments incurring costs to be managed within existing overall departmental expenditure limit totals.\u201d Tyrie wrote to the chancellor after the government refused to disclose to the Office for Budget Responsibility whether it made any financial promises to Nissan ahead of the autumn statement. The OBR\u2019s economic outlook report, released alongside the mini-budget, revealed that the fiscal watchdog \u201casked specifically whether any contingent liabilities had been created in respect of assurances provided to Nissan\u201d and that the Treasury declined to say. In October Nissan said it will build the next Qashqai and X-Trail models in Sunderland amid rising speculation that it could ditch the UK following the country\u2019s decision to quit the European Union. The move secured 7,000 jobs, but prompted concerns that a \u201csweetheart deal\u201d between with the carmaker and the government had been struck. Hammond also reiterated business secretary Greg Clark\u2019s statement in the Commons, in which he said four commitments were made to Nissan. These included to continue providing grants to the automotive industry, to support the research and development and takeup of ultra-low emission vehicles and to \u201cemphasise the common ground that exists between ourselves and EU member states to ensure that trade between us can be free and unencumbered\u201d. Asked by Tyrie if the latest letter from the chancellor gave him the assurance he needed on the impact of the deal, OBR chairman Rober Chote said: \u201cI would be more reassured than not having had anything at all.\u201d He said it showed that the government expects the impact to be limited, though the Treasury\u2019s statement appeared to be based on an assessment by the business department. \u201cIt remains open to the interpretation that this is the Treasury simply reporting the decision of the Business department and not making a judgment of its own,\u201d he said.",

      "bodyText": "The governor of the Bank of England has warned that European economies could be damaged if their access to the City of London is disrupted after Britain leaves the EU. Speaking as the Bank issued its half-yearly assessment of risks to the financial markets, Mark Carney said: \u201cThe UK is effectively the investment banker for Europe. More than half the equity and debt raised (for European governments and business) is raised in the UK, quite often from investors based in the United Kingdom.\u201d His remarks were in contrast to those earlier this week by Mario Draghi, the president of the European Central Bank, who said Britain would bear the brunt of the economic damage if Brexit created a UK economy with lower migration and weaker growth in trade and investment. Among the risks listed in the Bank\u2019s financial stability report were those posed by the uncertainties created by Brexit, which Carney said needed to be as \u201csmooth and orderly as possible\u201d. \u201cAdditional risks to the euro area could emerge as a consequence of the UK\u2019s withdrawal from the European Union. Banks located in the UK supply over half of debt and equity issuance by continental firms, and account for over three-quarters of foreign exchange and derivatives activity in the EU,\u201d said Carney. \u201cIf these UK-based firms have to adjust their activities in a short timeframe, there could be a greater risk of disruption to services provided to the European real economy, some of which could spill back to the UK economy through trade and financial linkages.\u201d Carney said there would be transitional arrangements and that it was preferable that firms in the City knew as \u201cmuch as possible about the desired end point and as much as possible as early as possible about the potential path to that end point\u201d. Article 50, the formal process of leaving the EU, has not yet been triggered and Carney said the timing for firms to implement contingency plans for Brexit \u201cis still some way off\u201d. He said the biggest risks to financial stability in the UK were from global sources, warning that there could be an impact on global trade from Donald Trump\u2019s election as US president. Chinese debt is high and there are also risks in the eurozone, including the Italian referendum on Sunday. Carney said he did not expect the slowdown in global growth to be as severe as the near-2% contraction in global growth which was included in this year\u2019s health check on the UK\u2019s banks. He added: \u201cThere is this possibility that the slowdown in the growth in world trade, which we have seen over the past few years, accelerates because of discrete policy initiatives potentially from the world\u2019s largest economy. \u201cWhile that might not directly affect the United Kingdom, if it slows the pace of global growth \u2013 and we\u2019re an open trading nation, one of the most open nations in the world \u2013 it\u2019s going to have a knock-on effect through this economy.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Royal Bank of Scotland was the biggest failure in the Bank of England\u2019s annual health check of the UK banking system and has embarked on a new plan to bolster its financial strength by \u00a32bn. The Edinburgh-based bank, which is 73% owned by taxpayers, is to cut costs and reduce its exposure to risky assets after the results of the toughest tests yet on the banking system were published on Wednesday. Two other banks, Barclays and Standard Chartered, also struggled in the so-called stress tests, which are based on hypothetical scenarios including house prices falling and the global economy contracting by 1.9%. Barclays already has a plan in place to bolster its financial position, while Standard Chartered said it has not needed to take any action. As the Bank announced the results of its third annual stress tests it warned of a \u201cchallenging period of uncertainty around the domestic and global economic outlook\u201d. Its financial stability report, a half-yearly update on risks to the financial system, listed domestic risks which include the uncertainty created by the Brexit vote, the commercial property sector, high level of debts in UK households and the potential vulnerability of the economy to a reduction in foreign investors buying UK debt. Mark Carney, the Bank governor, said Threadneedle Street was keeping an eye on debt. Households are \u201cdrawing down their savings and borrowing for the first time since the crisis\u201d, he said. Lending to households increased by 4.1% in the year to September, close to the fastest rate since the 2008 crisis. Global risks were described as \u201celevated\u201d, with the Bank also warning that there could be an impact on global trade from Donald Trump\u2019s election as US president. Chinese debt is high and the Bank also highlighted risks in some countries using the euro, including those caused by a referendum in Italy on Sunday. The Bank also provided its promised update on the health of the residential mortgage market and is keeping in place measures announced in 2014 to restrict lenders\u2019 ability to help customers needing to borrow four and half times their income. Carney said these measures were remaining because of household indebtedness. \u201cThis will help ensure that underwriting standards don\u2019t slip from responsible to reckless as they have during past periods of consumption-led growth,\u201d said Carney. Three other banks, Lloyds Banking Group, HSBC and the UK arm of Santander, as well as Nationwide, were subjected to the tests which were introduced after the 2008 crisis. The Bank found that in aggregate, the entire banking system was strong enough to withstand the test, which is based on a five-year scenario in which \u00a344bn of capital is wiped out in the first two years \u2013 five times the losses incurred during the depths of the financial crisis. Another test will run next year. Some of the banks tested this year would have used their bonds to help bolster their financial position. Under this scenario, another \u00a348bn of costs are incurred to pay fines and legal costs \u2013 more than the \u00a340bn hit the banks took between 2011 and 2015. The risk of further penalties was one of the reasons RBS failed to meet the hurdle set by the Bank as it awaits a penalty from the US for mortgage bond mis-selling before the crisis. RBS shares initially fell 4% but ended the day 1.3% lower while shares in the other banks tested were higher. Ewen Stevenson, RBS finance director, said: \u201cWe have taken further important steps in 2016 to enhance our capital strength, but we recognise that we have more to do to restore the bank\u2019s stress resilience, including resolving outstanding legacy issues.\u201d Deeper cuts to costs are expected when RBS reports its results next year which could entail job cuts. Analysts at UBS said: \u201cWe expect a bigger cost and restructuring plan [from RBS] in February.\u201d Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, pointed out \u201cRBS is in no immediate danger\u201d although he said the bank was the \u201cweak link in the UK banking chain\u201d. Barclays said it had passed the Bank\u2019s test. Standard Chartered said it \u201chas a strong and liquid balance sheet and the results of the stress test demonstrate its resilience to a severe global stress scenario\u201d.",

    "webTitle": "Philip Morris's vision of cigarette-free future met with scepticism", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Claims by tobacco giant Philip Morris, the US company behind brands including Marlboro, that conventional cigarettes could become a thing of the past have been met with scepticism. Speaking as he launched a new product that the firm claims is less harmful than traditional smoking, chief executive Andr\u00e9 Calantzopoulos predicted a \u201cphase-out period\u201d for cigarettes. He said the company\u2019s new iQos product, which heats tobacco but does not burn it, releases fewer toxins and is capable of replacing cigarettes in the long term. \u201cI believe that there will come a moment in time where we have sufficient adoption of this alternative product and sufficient awareness to start envisaging \u2013 together with governments \u2013 a phase-out period for cigarettes,\u201d he told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme on Wednesday. \u201cI hope this time will come soon.\u201d Philip Morris, the largest tobacco firm outside China, has invested $3bn (\u00a32.4bn) in the iQos, which differs from vaporisers or e-cigarettes that heat a liquid containing nicotine. The firm\u2019s prediction of a future without cigarettes came as the UK court of appeal ruled that plans to remove distinctive branding from packs will go ahead. But campaigners and industry analysts cast doubt on the chances of cigarettes being banished, either by e-cigarettes or other replacement products such as the iQos. Deborah Arnott, chief executive of anti-smoking group Ash, said: \u201cPhilip Morris claims to be moving towards a post-smoking future but, like other tobacco companies, it is still actively promoting smoking around the world, using methods that would be illegal in the UK.\u201d Rae Maile, tobacco industry analyst with City of London firm Cenkos Securities, pointed out that Calantzopoulos was vague about how long it might take for cigarettes to disappear. \u201cHe didn\u2019t say when ... so it\u2019s any time in the next century,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are 1 billion people quite happy with smoking. Cigarettes are easy to use, convenient and don\u2019t need recharging. People know the health risks and are willing to accept them. \u201cThere\u2019s plenty of demand from current smokers so it might change, but it\u2019ll be a very slow process.\u201d Despite the growing publicity surrounding vaporisers and e-cigarettes, they remain a nascent technology that forms only a tiny part of tobacco firms\u2019 income. Philip Morris, which has its headquarters in New York and runs its international operation from Switzerland, sold 847bn cigarettes in 2015 and had group revenues of $26.8bn (or $73.9bn including excise tax). UK-based rival British American Tobacco makes e-cigarettes under the Vype brand and this month launched a competitor to iQos called glo. But revenues from what it calls \u201cnext generation products\u201d are still so small that the company does not publish them, describing income from the division as \u201cnot currently material\u201d. Imperial Tobacco also does not publish figures for vaporiser sales, while it is yet to launch a \u201cheat-not-burn\u201d product like iQos. And while countries such as the US, UK, Italy and France have begun to embrace alternatives, the use of traditional cigarettes is still on the rise elsewhere. In Indonesia, the percentage of the 258 million-strong population that smokes every day is projected to rise from 30.9% of adults in 2010 to 40.7% by 2025, or nearly 80% among men, according to World Health Organisation figures. That compares with a predicted decline in the UK from 20.9% to 13.2% over the same period. Maile said rising smoking rates in the developing world were partly the result of lower life expectancy reducing people\u2019s fear of late-life diseases, as well the lack of social stigma attached to the habit. He pointed out that even markets such as the US, where smoking rates are declining, offer attractive opportunities for companies such as British American Tobacco, which recently spent $47bn to buy out Reynolds American. \u201cIf you look at the percentage penetration rate, it\u2019s halved since 1970 from over 40% to 20%, but the number of smokers has stayed at 45 million because you\u2019ve seen growth in the population,\u201d he said. Maile added that this pattern was replicated elsewhere, with markets such as Indonesia and north Africa expanding, even if population growth is not factored in. While Calantzopoulos claimed Philip Morris was shifting away from cigarettes, he also defended the company\u2019s role in smoking-related health problems. . \u201cI don\u2019t think Philip Morris invented cigarettes. For us, it\u2019s to offer our consumers the best product we can in a category that we all know is addictive and causes harm. \u201cOnce we have the alternative, as we have today, we offer them the alternative and we will do everything we can to convince [people] to switch to these products.\u201d Arnott said independent evidence was needed to support any claims made by the tobacco industry that new products were safer. \u201cFrom past experience, nothing the tobacco companies say should be accepted at face value,\u201d she said. \u201cFully independent research and assessment will be crucial if iQos and related products are to be accepted as useful in fighting the smoking epidemic.\u201d",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Here\u2019s a snap summary, for new readers just tuning in. Opec as defied sceptics and agreed its first production cut since the financial crisis struck. The oil cartel will shave 1.2 million barrels per day off its output, cutting it from 33.7m to 32.5m barrels per day. OPEC president Mohammed Bin Saleh Al-Sada announced the deal in Vienna this afternoon, after three days of talks and tension. He called it a \u2018historic move\u2019 that would help to stabilise the market. The deal was achieved thanks to a surprise agreement between Saudi Arabia, Iraq and Iran. Saudi will take the biggest hit, lowering output by almost 500k barrels per day, while Iraq will cut by 200,000. Iran, though, will be permitted to raise its production. The deal is dependent on non-Opec members chipping in, cutting by another 600,000 barrels per day. The two sides will met in 10 days time; Russia has indicated that it\u2019s on board. The oil price has surged by over 8% today, putting Brent crude over $50 per barrel. Analysts, though, question whether the deal will really work (Opec is creating a new oversight committee to try to ensure compliance). Mike Jakeman, Global analyst &amp; commodities editor, Economist Intelligence Unit, says there are four reasons to be cautious: First, it is possible that some cheating will occur. OPEC\u2019s members do not have a good track record of sticking to production quotas. Second, there has been no firm commitment yet from Russia, the largest non-OPEC producers. It is possible that Russian production could fill the gap left by Saudi. Third, production even at the lower level of 32.5m b/d is still a high level. There is no threat of an oil shortage that could see the price zoom backup. Last, if there was a sustained rise in prices, this would be likely to trigger a response from US shale producers, which would in turn push the price down again. We think the lack of a sustained rise in prices will see the deal fall apart within a year I\u2019ll be back tomorrow with more reaction and analysis. In the meantime, here\u2019s economics editor Larry Elliott\u2019s take: The price of oil has surged by 8% after the 14-nation cartel Opec agreed to its first cut in production in eight years. Confounding critics who said the club of oil-producing nations was too riven with political infighting to agree a deal, Opec announced it was trimming output by 1.2m barrels per day (bpd) from 1 January. The deal is contingent on securing the agreement of non-Opec producers to lower production by 600,000m barrels per day. But the Qatari oil minister Mohammed bin Saleh al-Sada said he was confident that the key non-Opec player \u2013 Russia \u2013 would sign up to a 300,000 bpd cut. Russia\u2019s oil minister Alexander Novak welcomed the Opec move but said his country would only be able to cut production gradually due to \u201ctechnical issues\u201d. A meeting with non-Opec countries in Moscow on 9 December has been pencilled in. Al-Sada said the deal was a great success and a \u201cmajor step forward\u201d. But the news that Saudi Arabia had effectively admitted defeat in its long-running attempt to drive US shale producers out of business was enough to send the price of crude sharply higher on the world\u2019s commodity markets..... Goodnight, and thanks for reading and commenting. GW Paul Dean, the global head of oil &amp; gas at legal firm HFW, questions whether today\u2019s deal will really stabilise the markets, as Opec hopes. The known unknowns are how Russia will react and whether it will lead to an increase in US production. The US picture made more complex from a geopolitical perspective by Trump\u2019s threatened ban on the import of Saudi crude. Therefore while there are certainly positives for the market to take from this agreement the jury must still be out on whether it is going to lead the stability that is so desperately needed. Now this is interesting.... Russia\u2019s energy minister Alexander Novak has welcomed Opec\u2019s decision to cut output by 1.2m barrels per day. He also confirms that Russia is ready to gradually cut oil output by up to 300,000, but only gradually because of \u201ctechnical issues\u201d, reports Reuters. Novak also confirms that non-Opec members (such as Russia) will meet with Opec in 10 days time to discuss the issue. He expects other non-Opec members to come on board and cut production too. Shares in oil companies have jumped sharply; Royal Dutch Shell has rallied by 4.2%, followed by BP up 3.8%. Smaller companies are benefitting too. Cairn Energy and Tullow Oil, which both pump crude from the North Sea, have surged around 14% today. This deal is a mixed blessing for the UK. On the upside, it makes North Sea oil more valuable. Scotland\u2019s oil industry should benefit from Brent crude surging 8% to $50/barrel; that\u2019s good for jobs. But.... car drivers face paying more at the pumps if this deal sticks, and companies are going to be charged more for transportation. That can feed into higher prices, which means lower real wages. Chatham House fellow Valerie Marcel points out that Saudi persuaded its fellow cartel members to share the pain, rather than taking the hit alone. Energy analyst Dominick Chirichella believes today\u2019s deal is significant, especially if non-Opec members cut output by 600,000. Important point: Opec are NOT using Indonesia\u2019s suspension to fiddle their output figures. They have genuinely agreed to cut output by 1.2m barrels per day. Journalists in Vienna have just been handed the new output table, explaining the details of today\u2019s agreement to reduce output by 1.2m barrels per day. And it confirms that Saudi Arabia will take the bulk of the cuts, cutting almost 500,000 barrels per day. Iraq is also on board, with a 210,000 cut, followed by the UAE (-139,000), Kuwait (-131,000) and Venezuela (-95,000). Smaller countries are also doing their bit. Iran, though, has the green light to keep raising output. The table also confirms that Indonesia has suspended its membership (because, as a net importer of oil, it didn\u2019t want to cut output and drive the price up). The Opec press conference is now over. I\u2019ll pull a summary together ASAP. In the meantime, here\u2019s some instant analysis from Mike Jakeman of the Economist Intelligence Unit: Q: What do you say to the naysayers who thought Opec was no longer relevent? Opec is still Opec, Saleh Al-Safa replies. If we weren\u2019t there, balancing the interests of members and non-members, we wouldn\u2019t have a deal today. Q: Won\u2019t this deal backfire on Opec, if higher prices encourage rival producers such as the shale industry back into the market? We don\u2019t see a threat from shale gas, Opec president Mohammed Bin Saleh Al-Sada replies. They will make their own assessment, regardless of what we do. Onto questions... Q: Why is Opec\u2019s new floor still 32.5 million barrels, even though Indonesia (which pumps 700k) have been suspended? Surely it should be lower? Opec officials explain that the 32.5m figure includes Indonesia\u2019s output; other Opec countries will take on its Q: What happens if non-Opec members don\u2019t deliver a 600,000 cut, as Opec are hoping for? Mohammed Bin Saleh Al-Sada says that he is confident that non-Opec will deliver their side; and suggests we watch Russia for an official announcement. Q: So is the deal dead, if non-Opec members don\u2019t agree? I think non-Opec are \u2018almost committed\u2019, replies Mohamed bin Saleh al-Sada. But they aren\u2019t here today, of course, so can\u2019t be included in the announcement. Q: And how much is Saudi Arabia going to cut? They will cut 486,000 barrels per day. This is \u201cmajor step forward and a historic agreement\u201d, Mohammed Bin Saleh Al-Sada declares. It will help to rebalance the market, and reduce the overhang of excess oil supplies. Opec are also setting up a new ministerial monitoring committee to ensure compliance with this deal, chaired by Kuwait, Venezuela and Algeria. OPEC president Mohammed Bin Saleh Al-Sada says that today\u2019s agreement is contingent on non-Opec members agreeing to cut their own output by 600,000 per day. And he reveals that Russia has already agreed to reduce output by 300,000 per day. The Opec press conference is starting now! OPEC President Mohammed Bin Saleh Al-Sada of Qatar declares that \u201cWe have made a great success today.\u201d Opec has agreed on the scenario outlined in Algeria, he continues (that was the meeting when the cartel agreed to cut production in principle). With the co-operation and understanding of all member companies, we have been able to reach an agreement. This agreement comes from a sense of responsibility for Opec member companies, and for non-Opec member countires, and the health and wellbeing of the world economy. The market needs to be rebalanced, and that needs couragous decisions from Opec and with the support of other countries. Mohammed Bin Saleh Al-Sada then confirms that the agreement is that Opec reduces output by 1.2m per day. This will lower its total output to 32,5m per day, effective from January 2017. And he also confirms that Indonesia has asked to suspend its Opec membership, because as a net importer of oil it will struggle to support today\u2019s deal. Iran\u2019s oil minister Bijan Namdar Zangeneh has just walked past the press pack, saying that he is \u201chappy\u201d with today\u2019s meeting. Zangenah adds that Opec is likely to hold a meeting with non-Opec members next week in Doha -- that would be the time for Russia to come on board with its own cuts. The Opec press conference is now an hour late, but there are signs that ministers have finally completed today\u2019s meeting. If Opec have agreed a deal, it will surprise many analysts who thought the cartel was a busted flush. Naeem Aslam of Think Markets explains: This is certainly the best present traders could have for Christmas - a supply cut from OPEC. The cartel has shown united front and this is what matters the most. There have been so many doubts over the year if they have the ability to deliver anything and today they have. Except, of course, we\u2019ve not seen the details! FXTM research Analyst Lukman Otunuga says there will be question\u2019s over Indonesia\u2019s rumoured suspension from Opec: It appears that in the most critical of moments, Saudi Arabia, Iran and Iraq have solved their difference consequently propelling oil prices further. While the deal is undeniably impressive, there are still some questions that need to be answered at the press conference. Reports of Indonesia being suspended from the cartel could probe the effectiveness of the production cut, as Indonesia continues to produce 750,000 barrels per day but this will not be included in the OPEC figures Financial news service Ransquawk has helpfully rounded up the various Opec rumours: Running an oil cartel must be hungry work, so we won\u2019t begrudge the energy ministers for breaking off for some (late) lunch. Leslie Hayward of Energy Fuse is in Vienna, and hearing that the talks might have restarted.... Here\u2019s Reuters\u2019 latest dispatch from Vienna: OPEC agrees first output cut since 2008, Saudis to take \u201cbig hit\u201d OPEC has agreed its first limit on oil output since 2008, sources in the producer group toldReuters, with Saudi Arabia accepting \u201ca big hit\u201d on its production and agreeing to arch-rival Iran freezing output at pre-sanctions levels. Brent crude futures jumped 8 percent to more than $50 a barrel after Riyadh signalled it had finally reached a compromise with Iran after insisting in recent weeks that Tehran fully participate in any cut. The source said the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries had on Wednesday agreed on a proposal by memberAlgeria to reduce production by around 4.5 percent, or about 1.2million barrels per day. Saudi Arabia would contribute around 0.5 million bpd by reducing output to 10.06 million bpd, the source said, while Iran would freeze output at close to current levels of 3.797million bpd and other members would also cut production. The source added that OPEC had also suspended Indonesia from OPEC and hence the exact combined reduction was yet to be calculated. The meeting was still ongoing after around six hours of debate. OPEC watcher Amrita Sen from Energy Aspects said: \u201cOPEC has proved to the sceptics that it is not dead. The move will speed up market rebalancing and erosion of the global oil glut.\u201d Before the meeting, Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih said OPEC was indeed focusing on significant cuts and hopedRussia and other non-OPEC producers would contribute a reduction of another 0.6 million bpd. Falih said: \u201cIt will mean that we (Saudi) take a big cut and a big hit from our current production and from our forecast for 2017.\u201d Clashes between Saudi Arabia and Iran have dominated many previous OPEC meetings. But the tone changed on Wednesday with Iranian Oil Minister Bijan Zanganeh saying he was positive since Iran had not been asked to cut output. He also said Russia was ready to reduce production. \u201cMoscow have agreed to reduce their production and cut after our decision,\u201d Zanganeh said. The Opec press conference has been delayed, with insiders saying today\u2019s agreement is being drafted now. Opec is due to hold a press conference shortly to announce the conclusions of today\u2019s meeting. It should be streamed online here. There\u2019s a rumour swirling that Indonesia might have been suspended from Opec today. That would free up its quota (more than 700k barrels per day) to be shared among other members of the cartel. If so (and we\u2019ll get the details eventually....) it\u2019s a bit of a swizz. Indonesia will still be pumping that oil, but it won\u2019t be counted in Opec\u2019s numbers. So it would be easier to get the group\u2019s total output down by 1.2m; Saudi might only have to cut by 500,000 barrels..... And there\u2019s also talk that Iran will freeze at 3.79m barrels per day, not the 3.9m rumoured earlier. All very confusing..... (good luck to anyone trading oil today....) Newsflash: America\u2019s Dow Jones stock markets has hit a new record high at the start of trading in New York. The Dow jumped 70 points, or 0.36%, to 19,191 points - with energy stocks boosted by reports of an Opec production cut (which still hasn\u2019t been confirmed, remember!) Airline stocks are falling, though; the 8% jump in the oil price will hurt their profits. While we wait for more action in Vienna, here\u2019s a video explaining the Bank of England\u2019s new stress tests (which Royal Bank of Scotland failed this morning). Gulf Energy correspondent Amena Bakr reports that Iran has agreed to fix its oil production at around 3.8 million barrels per day, helping to get today\u2019s deal over the line. (corrected) If so, that means Tehran has avoided having to cut output -- a real sticking point, as Iran has been ramping up production since sanctions were relaxed at the start of this year. So this deal might, as expected, centre on Saudi Arabia taking on much of the output cut. We may know more soon.... This story may not be over.... the chatter in Vienna is that Iraq is still disputing its oil production figures. This dispute centres on oil produced in Iraq\u2019s Kirkuk province, which is occupied by Iraqi Kurdistan. Many analysts reckon that Iraq is \u2018double-counting\u2019 the amount of oil produced by some fields in this region, creating a 290,000 barrels a day discrepancy between the country\u2019s official production total and the estimates from independent sources. There are rumours that any Opec deal might also be dependent on non-Opec members, ie Russia, also cutting output. Neil Wilson of ETX Capital explains: The latest we\u2019re hearing is that a deal has been done on the numbers and discussions are now underway on the monitoring committee. However in the latest twist, it looks like any cut will be dependent on non-OPEC members agreeing to limit output. Therefore getting this deal done may be down to Russia in the end \u2013 there is still potential for an agreement to come unstuck. Russia seems to be considering a 200k a day cut and OPEC wants 600k a day less from non-members. Monitoring will be crucial to ensure that members of the cartel are not pumping more than they claim to be. The problem for OPEC is that it\u2019s virtually impossible to track all the shipments reliably, so this will be a key detail. ABN Amro\u2019s Hans van Cleef nails it: Bloomberg\u2019s Javier Blas is pretty excited that Opec has (apparently) agreed to cut production by 1.2m barrels per day: But the FT\u2019s Neil Hume points out that we need to know more -- like which countries are actually going to cut, and by how much. NEWSFLASH: Reporters in Vienna are snapping that Opec has reached a deal! Reuters are quoting one delegate, who says ministers have managed to finalise the draft plan made in September in Algiers. That means oil production will be cut by around 1.2 million barrels per day, in an attempt to trim supply and push the oil price higher. The same delegate has also spoken to Bloomberg -- s/he must have been in demand -- and confirmed that daily production will be cut to 32.5m barrels, We still don\u2019t know the details though -- like which Opec members will actually cut, and how the deal will be enforced. It\u2019s likely, though, that Saudi Arabia will take the brunt of it (as we covered earlier, Iran isn\u2019t expecting to cut its output). But it\u2019s enough to keep the Brent crude oil price around $50 per barrel, a 7% surge today. Opec are due to hold a press conference at 4pm Vienna time, or 3pm GMT. So we should learn then if a deal has been reached, and whose agreed to cut oil production. Fawad Razaqzada, market analyst at Forex.com, reckons the oil price could shed some of today\u2019s surge once the details emerge: The only thing speculators are not too sure about yet is the detail of the deal: who will cut oil production and by how much, and who will freeze and at what levels? But with oil prices having already gone up so much and still rising, I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if prices then start to ease back a tad in a typical \u201cbuy the rumour, sell the news\u201d reaction. However, the potential selling pressure will likely be mild, unless of course the negotiations break down. But it is also possible that the deal to limit oil production will not be bold enough. There\u2019s another interesting wrinkle to watch out for; Opec members typically report higher output figures than independent experts. So, if the independent \u2018secondary sources\u2019 are right, oil producers have an artificial cushion which they can cut into, without actually limiting real output. Shares in oil companies are rocketing higher too. Royal Dutch Shell are leading the FTSE 100 risers, up 4.75%, while BP gained 3.7%. That mirrors the surge in the oil price, and shows that City investors expect both firms to benefit from an Opec production cut. But... higher oil prices will mean an even tighter squeeze on real earnings next year, hurting family budgets and hitting many businesses with steeper transport costs. Brent crude has now bursted up through $50 per barrel, following those reports that Opec might agree to cut production by 1.4 million barrels per day. Bloomberg\u2019s chief energy correspondent , Javier Blas, can see an Opec deal coming together.... That\u2019s keeping the oil price buoyant.... UBS\u2019s banking analyst Jason Napier predicts that Royal Bank of Scotland will take fresh cost cutting measures in 2017, having failed today\u2019s UK stress tests. He tells clients that: We expect a bigger cost and restructuring plan in February \u2013 with associated capital costs \u2013 and colour around noncore, low return assets within the Commercial Bank, including \u00a38.5bn in risk-weighted assets. With uncertainty around timing and cost of the Williams &amp; Glyn branch sale and the US Department of Justice probe into its residential mortgage-backed securities cases, we think RBS remains under pressure to deliver on core profits, principally by achieving further significant cost cuts. Here\u2019s a nice chart, showing how the oil price has languished behind other commodities for months: Oil is surging even higher now, after Saudi Arabia said it could take a \u2018big hit\u2019 to get a deal at today\u2019s Opec meeting. Brent crude has spiked by over 7% to almost $50 per barrel, as traders anticipate that the oil cartel will hammer out production curbs in Vienna today. Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih ignited the rally, by telling reporters that Opec could finalise cuts of more than one million barrels per day (the rough target). He also suggested that some non-Opec members might come on board too, in a co-ordinated attempt to squeeze production down (driving the cost of oil up). Reuters has the details: Falih said OPEC was focusing on reducing output to a ceiling of 32.5 million barrels per day, or cutting by more than1 million bpd, and hoped Russia and other non-OPEC members would contribute a cut of another 0.6 million bpd. \u201cIt will mean that we (Saudi) take a big cut and a big hit from our current production and from our forecast for 2017. So we will not do it unless we make sure that there is consensus and an agreement to meet all of the principles,\u201d Falih said. In other news, inflation across the euro area has inched up to its highest level since April 2014. Consumer prices rose by an annual rate of 0.6% in November, says statistics body Eurostat. The service sector drove inflation up, with prices 1.1% than a year ago, followed by food, alcohol and tobacco (up 0.7%). Fuel and heating costs pulled inflation back, with energy costs 1.1% cheaper than a year ago. However, the impact of cheap oil may soon drop out of the inflation calculations - especially if Opec agree a production cut today. Santander UK\u2019s chief financial officer, Antonio Roman, says his bank is pleased to have passed this year\u2019s stress tests: They reflect the resilience of our business model and the strength of our balance sheet. We are well positioned to build on this strength in 2017.\u201d Some more photos from the Opec meeting: There\u2019s also drama in Vienna, as some Opec oil ministers suddenly express real confidence that the cartel will reach an agreement to cut production today. Brent crude has surged by almost 6% to $49.06, a one-week high, after a flurry of comments from Opec. Saudi Arabia\u2019s Khalid al-Falih told reporters that Opec is close to reaching a deal. And crucially, he indicated that Saudi was happy with the idea that Iran would freeze production, rather than cutting. That sounds like a potential concession from Opec\u2019s largest member, which would have to take the bulk of any cut. Al-Falih was speaking to reporters in the traditional \u2018open-room\u2019 session, before the press are thrown out and Opec can get down to business. The UAE\u2019s representative said the meeting is looking \u201cvery positive\u201d, while Nigeria says he thinks there will be a deal. HOWEVER.... we don\u2019t have a deal yet. And the newswires are also running quotes from Iran which suggest it won\u2019t freeze output.... Mark Carney managed to fire a double-barrelled Brexit warning this morning, urging Westminster and Brussels to avoid the dangers of a badly planned exit. Perhaps his most important comment was his warning that Britain is Europe\u2019s \u2018investment banker\u2019 -- a message that EU firms will suffer if Brexit goes badly wrong. Carney says: \u201cThe U.K. is effectively the investment banker for Europe. \u201cThese activities are crucial for firms in the European Union economy, and it\u2019s absolutely in the interest of the European Union that there is an orderly transition and that there\u2019s continual access to those services.\u201d In other words -- if the City suddenly loses its \u2018passporting rights\u2019 to offer financial services in the EU, European firms might find themselves paying more for a worse financial service. So Europe should be careful about letting Britain plunge into a \u2018hard Brexit\u2019 in 2019. That\u2019s also a coded rebuke to ECB president Mario Draghi, who claimed on Monday that the eurozone would be less hurt by Brexit upheaval than Britain itself. But Carney and Draghi are in full agreement on one matter -- Theresa May must lay out a plan for Brexit, rather than leaving firms in the dark. The BoE governor says: \u201cIt is preferable that firms know as much as possible about the desired endpoint, what type of relationship would be there, and as much as possible, as early as possible, about the potential path to that endpoint.\u201d Carney also signalled that Donald Trump risks destabilising the global recovery: \u201cThere is this possibility that the slowdown in the growth in world trade, which we have seen over the past few years, accelerates because of discrete policy initiatives potentially from the world\u2019s largest economy. \u201cWhile that might not directly affect the United Kingdom, if it slows the pace of global growth - and we\u2019re an open trading nation, one of the most open nations in the world - it\u2019s going to have a knock-on effect through this economy.\u201d And on the stress tests, Carney offered some support to Royal Bank of Scotland: \u201cIts challenge is that it still has legacy issues.... There\u2019s misconduct costs, there\u2019s impaired assets,they\u2019re still working through the so-called non-core assets on which they have made progress.\u201d \u201cThey have made progress over the course of the year, they have identified and made an announcement today about additional actions they will be taking.\u201d Edward Chan, banking partner at global law firm Linklaters, says today\u2019s stress tests miss one of the biggest threats to the UK financial sector -- Brexit. \u201cThis year\u2019s Bank of England stress test scenarios were drawn up in March; while the adverse scenario incorporates a global growth downturn, capital flows to safe havens and a depreciation of emerging market currencies against the dollar, it does not model the impact of the uncertainty resulting from Brexit negotiations nor the consequences of the actual exit from the EU. It will be interesting to see how the adverse scenario is modelled in next year\u2019s stress test given the Bank of England cautious response post Brexit. Fernando de la Mora, managing director at Alvarez &amp; Marsal, explains why the tests matter: Three banks failed the test for different reasons. RBS failed the test, Barclays received a light fail and Standard Chartered got a qualitative fail. As has been the case in the US with the Fed, the Bank of England is tightening its stance on stress test capital requirements, making them more binding for banks. Naeem Aslam, chief market analyst at Think Markets, isn\u2019t surprised that RBS came bottom of the class: The institute has not made any meaningful headway in relation to all challenges it is facing such as the sale of mortgage-backed securities over in the US [where it could be fined by the DoJ] There is still no buyer for its Williams and Glyn unit. Over in the City, shares in Royal Bank of Scotland have fallen by 2.7% at the start of trading following the news that it must strengthen its capital position. They\u2019re down 5.3p at 191p -- a long way away from 502p, which is the break-even point for the taxpayer to recover the huge bailout of 2008. Lloyds, who sailed through the stress tests, are up 1.2%. HSBC and Barclays are up a bit too, while Standard Chartered (who sailed close to the wind in these stress tests) are flat. Some City analysts has speculated the RBS might fail the tests, and be required to submit a new capital plan. Kathleen Brooks of City Index says: RBS\u2019s initial outline includes reducing costs (probably more job losses), reducing risk-weighted assets across the bank, and further asset disposals. RBS wasn\u2019t the only bank that came in for criticism from the report; Barclays and Standard Chartered were also mentioned. Barclays was cited for its systemic risks, and Standard Chartered missed its tier one capital requirement, but both banks do not need to submit revised capital plans to the BOE. This is good news for Standard Chartered, as there had been some concern for the bank ahead of the publishing of this report due to its exposure to emerging markets and commodities. Finally, Carney says there is still \u201cquite good momentum\u201d in the drive to create better global financial regulation. The key, he says, is to create cross-border partnerships (to avoid a repeat of the 2008 financial crisis). And that\u2019s the end of the press conference. Q: How frustrated are you that Royal Bank of Scotland failed this year\u2019s stress tests? RBS has made a lot of progress in recent years, says Carney, especially around its core business -- to serve UK small businesses and households. However, it still has legacy issues to deal with. As Carney puts it: It lost its way over a number of years and did a number of other things...not particularly well. That\u2019s a coded jibe at RBS\u2019s former boss, the de-knighted Fred Goodwin, whose ambitious growth plans ended in utter disaster in 2008. Carney emphasises that RBS doesn\u2019t have to raise extra capital; it has to reduce risks assets, to put itself in a stronger position to handle another financial crisis. Q: How concerned is the Bank of England about Italy (which holds a constitutional referendum on Sunday)? Not very, it seems. Carney says that the UK has very little exposure to Italian banks directly. Q: Investment banks need two years to organise an exit from the UK, so are you hoping that Theresa May will give them more clarity on her plans when she triggers Article 50? Carney disputes the figure, saying that the BoE thinks banks would need less time (on average). And he reiterates that firms need as much clarity as possible. All trade deals need a transition period, Carney says. The more abrupt the Brexit transition is, the greater the risk of disruption to supplying those financial services to the continent and the greater the risk of the cost going up, says Carney. And he points out that firms can\u2019t wait until Britain is on the brink of actually leaving the EU. Nothing is agreed until everything is agreed, and everything isn\u2019t agreed until the last minute. So firms may be forced to make decisions without knowing exactly what the future holds. Another question about the next US president. Q: Is Donald Trump\u2019s plan to roll back financial regulation a threat to financial stability? Carney says the president-elect has focused on domestic banks, and whether burden on them affecting their ability to create jobs and help US companies -- hinting that it\u2019s not a massive concern to the UK. Global regulation is focused on banks that are active across the world, he adds. Our City editor Jill Treanor asks whether the BoE is getting more concerned about the buy-to-let market. Deputy governor Sir Jon Cunliffe says that buy-to-let market seems to be subdued, but there are not signs that landlords are putting more properties on the market. Q: How worried are you about President Trump enacting some of his policies on global trade? Carney says there is a risk that the existing slowdown in trade accelerates, because of \u201cdiscrete policy initiatives from the world\u2019s largest economy\u201d. We\u2019re one of the most open trading nations in the world, so if it slows the pace of global growth then it would have a knock-on effect on the UK, Carney explains. Carney is then asked about household debt levels (yesterday we learned that consumer credit is growing at the fastest pace in 11 years). He says that household debt position has improved, but is still high. The good thing is that households and businesses, young people starting out in their first homes, can get credit at affordable terms. Q: Would the Bank of England be less concerned about the financial stability implications posed by the US economy if Hillary Clinton had won the US election? We\u2019ll never know, so it\u2019s impossible to speculate, smiles Carney. He explains that the stress tests have tested Britain\u2019s banks ability to handle the \u201cextreme versions\u201d of the tensions that are starting to emerge (as capital exits emerging markets and returns to America) Onto Questions.... Sam Coates of The Times takes the new ball, and asks Carney to clarify his comments about needing an \u2018orderly\u2019 Brexit process. Q: Are you saying that there should be a \u2018transitional deal, rather than a cliff edge? As the prime minister has said, it\u2019s preferable that this process is as smooth as possible, Carney replies. He says that there will be a transition - either at the end of the negotiations, or during them. It is preferable that firms know as much as possible about the desired endpoint, and as early as possible about the potential path about that endpoint. Carney points out that City firms are already wondering how Brexit will affect their operations. As such, \u201ca decree of clarity when appropriate\u201d will help provide \u201ca smooth and orderly Brexit process\u201d. Governor Carney also points out that many European businesses rely on the City of London for financial services. So, it\u2019s in Europe\u2019s interest that these firms can still access financial services from the UK. The United Kingdom is effectively the investment banker for Europe. Today\u2019s tests have shown that Britain\u2019s banking sector is well-capitalised, and in a good position to keep lending to homes and businesses, Carney insists. Although today\u2019s tests showed some capital inadequacies (at RBS, Barclays, and Standard Chartered), \u201cthe bottom line.... is that each bank now has the necessary plans to buid their resilience further\u201d And he declares: The UK financial system has shown its ability to dampen, not amplify, a series of shocks. And he touches on Brexit again, saying that the \u201corderliness\u201d of the adjustment to a new relationship will affect stability. Governor Mark Carney begins by saying that Britain\u2019s financial system has \u201cstood up well\u201d to turbulence this year, such as the reaction to Britain\u2019s EU vote. Carney says the most significant risks to stability are global. He singles out China, where growth is increasingly reliant on borrowing. Capital outflows from China could accelerate, he warns, as the US raises interest rates. He also suggests that the eurozone could pose additional threats to UK financial stability in future, if the Brexit vote hurts the EU economy. Carney says the UK\u2019s current account remains \u201clarge by historic standards\u201d, adding that the slump in the pound since June shows that international investors expect Britain to be less open to trade, and grow slower, because of the Brexit vote. The Bank of England is holding a press conference now to explain its bank stress tests, and its latest financial stability report. You can see it live here. Standard Chartered has issued a statement, confirming that it only passed today\u2019s stress tests because it has already raised fresh capital this year. The Prudential Regulation Authority Board concluded that the Group did not meet its Tier 1 risk-weighted capital requirement including Pillar 2A but determined that in light of the steps the Group has subsequently taken to strengthen its capital position it does not require it to submit a revised capital plan. Standard Chartered also points out that it found today\u2019s stress tests particularly tough, because it modelled a slump in Asia (its main market). The scenario for the Stress Test was severe for the Group\u2019s business operations as it includes a synchronised global downturn with particularly severe impact on Asia, as well as a generalised downturn in emerging market economies. Royal Bank of Scotland has issued a statement to the City, confirming that it has agreed a revised capital plan to tackle the shortcomings uncovered by the BoE. Ewen Stevenson, chief financial officer, insists that RBS has been taking action, but agrees that more work is needed. \u201cWe are committed to creating a stronger, simpler and safer bank for our customers and shareholders. We have taken further important steps in 2016 to enhance our capital strength, but we recognise that we have more to do to restore the bank\u2019s stress resilience including resolving outstanding legacy issue. The statement is online here. Today\u2019s stress tests are the toughest ones ever set by the Bank of England. As this chart shows, it is roughly equivalent to the slump experienced during the financial crisis, albeit with a shallower fall in domestic output, and a more severe rise in unemployment and fall in residential property prices You can see the whole report here: Stress testing the UK banking system: 2016 results Here\u2019s the official verdict from the Bank of England\u2019s Prudential Regulation Authority, explaining how RBS doesn\u2019t hold enough capital to cope with a big financial crisis: The test did not reveal capital inadequacies for four out of the seven participating banks, based on their balance sheets at end-2015 (HSBC, Lloyds Banking Group, Nationwide Building Society and Santander UK). The Royal Bank of Scotland Group (RBS) did not meet its common equity Tier 1 (CET1) capital or Tier 1 leverage hurdle rates before additional Tier 1 (AT1) conversion in this scenario. After AT1 conversion, it did not meet its CET1 systemic reference point or Tier 1 leverage ratio hurdle rate. Based on RBS\u2019s own assessment of its resilience identified during the stress-testing process, RBS has already updated its capital plan to incorporate further capital strengthening actions and this revised plan has been accepted by the PRA Board. The PRA will continue to monitor RBS\u2019s progress against its revised capital plan. Barclays did not meet its CET1 systemic reference point before AT1 conversion in this scenario. In light of the steps that Barclays had already announced to strengthen its capital position, the PRA Board did not require Barclays to submit a revised capital plan. While these steps are being executed, its AT1 capital provides some additional resilience to very severe shocks. Standard Chartered met all of its hurdle rates and systemic reference points in this scenario. However, it did not meet its Tier 1 minimum capital requirement (including Pillar 2A). In light of the steps that Standard Chartered is already taking to strengthen its capital position, including the AT1 it has issued during 2016, the PRA Board did not require Standard Chartered to submit a revised capital plan. [explainer: AT1 bonds are capital which is designed to convert into equity if a bank hits trouble. Effectively a buffer to protect a bank from a crisis] My colleague Jill Treanor is at the Bank of England, and reports that RBS has already announced how it will react to failing today\u2019s stress tests. Royal Bank of Scotland has emerged as the biggest failure in the Bank of England\u2019s annual health check of the banking system. The 73% taxpayer owned bank has issued a plan to Threadneedle Street over night intended to bolster its financial strength by an estimated \u00a32bn. Two other banks \u2013 Barclays and Standard Chartered \u2013 also struggled in the so-called stress tests which are based on hypothetical scenarios of including falls in house prices and the global economy contracting by 1.9%. Barclays already has a plan in place to bolster its financial position while Standard Chartered has not needed to take any action. Remember, these tests assessed how the banks would cope with a recession, a housing crash and a halving of the oil price. Here we go! Royal Bank of Scotland, the lender bailed out by the taxpayer in 2008, has failed today\u2019s stress tests! That means RBS must take fresh action to protect itself against a sharp slump in the economy. The tests also found that Standard Chartered and Barclays would need more capital if the economy deteriorated. They aren\u2019t being forced to raise new money today though. But HSBC, Nationwide, Lloyds, and Santander UK have all passed. Good morning. We\u2019ve got two big events on the agenda today. The Bank of England is releasing its stress tests of the British banking sector, showing how UK\u2019s lenders could cope with a serious economic downturn. Barclays, HSBC, Lloyds Banking Group, Royal Bank of Scotland, the UK arm of Spanish bank Santander and Standard Chartered have all been examined closely, plus the Nationwide building society. The tests will assess if these companies can cope with a sharp recession, a housing market crash, and a clump in the oil price. Out City editor Jill Treanor explains all: The Bank has set out an imaginary five-year period in which there is a \u201csynchronised global downturn\u201d under which the global economy contracts by 1.9% \u2013 as it did during the financial crisis. It has also incorporated domestic factors: a 31% fall in house prices, 42% reduction in commercial property prices with the economy contracting by 4.3% and unemployment rising by 4.5 percentage points. The dollar rises against emerging market currencies and the oil price troughs at $20 per barrel. Here\u2019s Jill\u2019s preview: The BoE is also publishing its latest Financial Stability Report, showing the main threats to the UK economy following the Brexit vote. The results come at 7am, followed by a press conference with governor Mark Carney at 7.30am. But that\u2019s not all! Over in Vienna, oil ministers are gathering for the latest Opec meeting. They\u2019ll attempt to hammer out the details of a deal to cap oil output, in an attempt to push up prices. But there\u2019s no guarantee of success. Iran, Iraq and Saudi Arabia are all taking this meeting to the wire in a display of brinksmanship, so it\u2019s not clear if Opec can agree an overall quota, and decide how it is shared between its members. Here\u2019s the key timings: 10 a.m. Vienna time (9am GMT): Opening session 12 p.m. noon Vienna time: Closed session 4 p.m. Vienna time: Press conference. We\u2019ll be tracking all the main events through the day!",

Iran, though, will be permitted to raise its production.</p> <p><strong>The deal is dependent on non-Opec members chipping in, cutting by another 600,000 barrels per day.</strong> The two sides will met in 10 days time; Russia has indicated that it\u2019s on board.</p> <p>The oil price has surged by over 8% today, putting Brent crude over $50 per barrel.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2016/nov/30/bank-of-england-stress-tests-opec-meeting-oil-business-live?page=with:block-583f10fbe4b056d3d56ac111#block-583f10fbe4b056d3d56ac111\">Analysts, though, question whether the deal will really work</a> (Opec is creating a new oversight committee to try to ensure compliance).</p> <p><strong>Mike Jakeman, Global analyst &amp; commodities editor, Economist Intelligence Unit, says there are four reasons to be cautious:</strong></p> <ul> <li>First, it is possible that some cheating will occur. OPEC\u2019s members do not have a good track record of sticking to production quotas.<br></li> <li>Second, there has been no firm commitment yet from Russia, the largest non-OPEC producers. It is possible that Russian production could fill the gap left by Saudi.<br></li> <li>Third, production even at the lower level of 32.5m b/d is still a high level. There is no threat of an oil shortage that could see the price zoom backup.<br></li> <li>Last, if there was a sustained rise in prices, this would be likely to trigger a response from US shale producers, which would in turn push the price down again. We think the lack of a sustained rise in prices will see the deal fall apart within a year<br></li> </ul> <p><strong>I\u2019ll be back tomorrow with more reaction and analysis. <br></strong></p> <p>In the meantime, here\u2019s economics editor Larry Elliott\u2019s take:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The price of oil has surged by 8% after the 14-nation cartel <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2016/nov/30/bank-of-england-stress-tests-opec-meeting-oil-business-live\">Opec agreed to its first cut in production in eight years</a>.</p> <p>Confounding critics who said the club of oil-producing nations was too riven with political infighting to agree a deal, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/opec\">Opec</a> announced it was trimming output by 1.2m barrels per day (bpd) from 1 January.</p> <p>The deal is contingent on securing the agreement of non-Opec producers to lower production by 600,000m barrels per day.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The price of oil has surged by 8% after the 14-nation cartel Opec agreed to its first cut in production in eight years. Confounding critics who said the club of oil-producing nations was too riven with political infighting to agree a deal, Opec announced it was trimming output by 1.2m barrels per day (bpd) from 1 January. The deal is contingent on securing the agreement of non-Opec producers to lower production by 600,000m barrels per day. But the Qatari oil minister, Mohammed bin Saleh al-Sada, said he was confident that the key non-Opec player \u2013 Russia \u2013 would sign up to a 300,000 bpd cut. Russia\u2019s oil minister, Alexander Novak, welcomed the Opec move but said his country would only be able to cut production gradually due to \u201ctechnical issues\u201d. A meeting with non-Opec countries in Moscow on 9 December has been pencilled in. Al-Sada said the deal was a great success and a \u201cmajor step forward\u201d, but the news that Saudi Arabia had effectively admitted defeat in its long-running attempt to drive US shale producers out of business was enough to send the price of crude sharply higher on the world\u2019s commodity markets. Brent crude was trading at just over $50 a barrel following the completion of the Opec meeting in Vienna \u2013 an increase of almost $4 on the day. Saudi Arabia will bear the brunt of Opec\u2019s production curbs, having agreed to a reduction in output of just under 500,000 bpd. Iraq has agree to a 210,000 bpd cut, followed by the United Arab Emirates (-139,000), Kuwait (-131,000) and Venezuela (-95,000). Smaller countries are also reducing output, but Iran \u2013 which has only recently returned to the global oil market after the lifting of international sanctions \u2013 has been allowed to continue raising output. Three OPEC countries - Kuwait, Venezuela and Algeria - will monitor compliance with the agreement in an attempt to prevent quota busting. Indonesia has suspended its membership because, as a net importer of oil, it wanted the price of crude to stay as low as possible and declined to cut output. The price of oil has fallen from $115 a barrel since the summer of 2014 as a result of weak demand and the decision by Riyadh to keep production levels high. Saudi Arabia gambled that it could drive higher-cost US shale producers out of business but found the financial cost of more than halving the oil price too much to bear. At one stage, oil prices fell below $30 a barrel. Opec has been trying to piece together a production-cutting deal throughout 2016 but previous meetings have failed as a result of ill feeling between Saudi Arabia and Iran. The cartel, which exerted enormous power over the oil price in the 1970s, was under pressure going into this week\u2019s meeting to prove that it still had relevance in a market where it is responsible for less than half global output. Neil Wilson, a senior market analyst at ETX Capital, said Opec had \u201cconfounded the naysayers\u201d. He added that it was a \u201ctriumph for the cartel, proving it is still relevant, but the devil is in the detail \u2026 There are a few doubts but, on the whole, Opec should be pleased with a job well done at long last. This is likely to keep crude closer to $50 than $40 for now\u201d. Other analysts warned that the deal was likely to fall apart. Mike Jakeman, the commodities editor at the Economist Intelligence Unit, said he thought it unlikely that the agreement would lead to a sustained increase in the oil price. It is possible that some cheating will occur. Opec\u2019s members do not have a good track record of sticking to production quotas. There has also been no firm commitment yet from Russia, the largest non-Opec producers. It is possible that Russian production could fill the gap left by Saudi Arabia. And even at 32.5m bpd, global oil production will still be at a historically high level. There is no threat of an oil shortage that could see the price zoom back up. Jakeman said that even if there was a sustained rise in prices, the response would be higher production from the US shale sector, which would drive prices back down again. \u201cWe think the lack of a sustained rise in prices will see the deal fall apart within a year,\u201d he said.",

      "bodyText": "The price of oil has risen sharply after Opec members meeting in Vienna said they were on the verge of agreeing a deal to cut production. Brent crude was up by more than 7% at $49.80 a barrel on Wednesday following comments from some of the world\u2019s leading oil producers, who have gathered to discuss possible action to rein in the oversupply of oil and halt the fall in prices. The Saudi energy minister, Khalid al-Falih, said a deal was close and Riyadh was prepared to take \u201ca big hit\u201d on its own production. Falih said Opec was focused on capping production at 32.5m barrels a day, or cutting output by more than 1m barrels a day. He said he hoped Russia and other non-Opec members would also contribute by cutting production by 600,000 barrels a day. \u201cIt will mean that we take a big cut and a big hit from our current production and from our forecast for 2017. So we will not do it unless we make sure that there is consensus and an agreement to meet all of the principles,\u201d he said. The Iranian oil minister, Bijan Zanganeh, said he was optimistic that an agreement would be reached among Opec members and claimed that Russia was also ready to cut production. \u201cMoscow have agreed to reduce their production and cut after our decision,\u201d Zanganeh said. A press conference is expected to follow the meeting at 3pm UK time. The conciliatory tone was in contrast with previous exchanges, when Iran and Iraq disagreed with Saudi Arabia over a way forward, making it hard for the group to achieve a consensus. Michael Hewson, the chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK, said: \u201cIt would appear that the long-awaited output deal appears to hinge around whether or not Iraq, Iran and Saudi Arabia can bridge the gap that has opened up between them, on who caps production and who cuts it, with some talk of a cut of about 1.2m barrels a day being mooted.\u201d Commodity strategists at RBC Capital Markets said they were sticking to their view that a deal would be agreed. Opec accounts for one-third of global oil production and in September, members agreed to limit output to between 32.5m and 33m barrels a day, from the current 33.64m, to prop up prices. The ambition for Wednesday\u2019s meeting is to agree individual production targets for each country. However, concerns remain that reducing output will lead to non-Opec oil producers taking a greater share of the market.",

      "bodyText": "Behind the showbiz hullaballoo of ITV\u2019s annual showcase for advertisers at the London Palladium, the company\u2019s chief executive, Adam Crozier, is facing his stiffest test since successfully leading the broadcaster out of the previous recession after taking the helm in 2010. The red carpet event last Thursday came as Brexit jitters left ITV facing its worst run-up to Christmas for advertising revenue since 2008. Crozier has spent the six years since the most recent major advertising recession investing more than \u00a31bn in building an international TV production powerhouse to steel the broadcaster against just such a downturn. However, investors are starting to question whether ITV Studios \u2013 which makes and sells shows including Victoria, Mr Selfridge, Come Dine with Me and Coronation Street \u2013 is starting to lose its glitter. Investors took fright when ITV Studios reported a 9% fall in organic revenues, which excludes the revenue from recent acquisitions such as The Voice maker Talpa Media, and Poldark and Parade\u2019s End maker Mammoth, for the first nine months of the year. This followed a 34% decline in revenues at its US production operation in the first half of the year. The US has been Crozier\u2019s main market for international expansion, with hundreds of millions of pounds spent buying the makers of shows including Duck Dynasty, Pawn Stars and Cake Boss. ITV prompted further concern by saying profit growth at ITV Studios, which has increased from \u00a391m in 2009 to an expected \u00a3250m this year, will flatline in 2017. ITV, which took the unusual step of organising a call with analysts to reassure investors, brushed off concerns by blaming factors including the \u201clumpy\u201d nature of broadcasters\u2019 timing of when to air shows. For example, Hell\u2019s Kitchen, ITV\u2019s biggest global franchise judged by the number of countries to which it has been sold, is not airing this year, but has two series scheduled in 2017. Sarah Simon, an analyst at Berenberg, said of ITV\u2019s need to organise a special call: \u201cIt is a bit of a giveaway [that there really is an issue] if you feel it needs to be discussed. The pitch about [expanding] ITV Studios in the beginning was that there is structural growth, a demand for high-quality content, and that it is not cyclical like advertising. People who thought this was a steady growth business need to revise expectations and expect volatility.\u201d Crozier has spent \u00a31.2bn acquiring 15 production companies, a figure that could rise to nearly \u00a32bn by 2021 if the former owners reach their earn-out targets, triggering further payments. Crozier said ITV Studios had experienced a blip, and new and returning dramas would help fuel a return to organic revenue growth next year. \u201cWe remain very confident in the outlook for ITV Studios,\u201d he told analysts earlier this month. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a really good, strong pipeline of new and returning dramas.\u201d He told investors that profit would be flat in 2017 as ITV Studios focused on major investment in finding new hit shows. \u201cWe do think it is the right thing to do to invest in our studios business,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t think we would be doing the right thing for the business if we didn\u2019t continue to invest in that long-term success. That\u2019s absolutely the right thing for us to do.\u201d Investment in ITV Studios has been the most successful part of Crozier\u2019s three-pronged diversification plan. Online and pay revenues, such as through video advertising and Sky pay-TV channel Encore, have more than doubled to \u00a3188m in the past five years, but still account for only 6% of ITV\u2019s \u00a33bn-plus total revenues. A senior executive at a rival TV company said the ITV Studios strategy may have peaked and its foray into the US market had not yet worked out. Despite the huge investment in the US, at least 80% of ITV\u2019s total revenues come from the UK, and up to 70% of these are from advertising. \u201cThe general view is that it has been a great short-term strategy,\u201d the executive said. \u201cThey wanted a transformational story and to say they increased profits. No doubt it worked and drove share price. The problem is they seem to have overpaid for some assets in the UK, and especially the US.\u201d A wider issue facing ITV, and all traditional broadcasters, is the rise of the deep-pocketed digital upstarts. Netflix, which has a $7bn (\u00a35.6bn) TV and film content budget next year, is investing heavily in shows such as royal drama The Crown, its first UK production, which cost an average of more than \u00a35m per episode. Amazon\u2019s signing of the former Top Gear presenters to make three series of the recently launched The Grand Tour has a reported \u00a3160m price tag. The more budget-conscious ITV, which spends about \u00a31bn per year on programming, spends closer to \u00a31m an episode for a select few top-flight dramas, such as Victoria. ITV\u2019s share price has climbed from 55p when Crozier was appointed in January 2010 to 280p in 2015. However, ITV has wobbled in the past year and, exacerbated by the economic fallout from the EU referendum, the broadcaster\u2019s share price has fallen by one-third to less than 170p. In September, Crozier sold \u00a31m of shares at \u00a32 apiece, a move investors took a dim view of, sending shares tumbling. Alex DeGroote, an analyst at Peel Hunt, said: \u201cDirectors selling is very rarely viewed as a positive, because nobody knows the company\u2019s prospects better than executive management.\u201d DeGroote questioned whether the ITV Studios stumble, and the uncertain economic environment and fall in the value of the pound following the Brexit vote, could derail Crozier\u2019s plan and make the broadcaster a takeover target. \u201cThis was a very sure-footed management team that has executed seamlessly on the recovery story since 2009,\u201d he said. \u201cBut Brexit has changed the rules of engagement. Working through the course of the year, I have become progressively more disappointed in the ITV story. \u201cWith the pound so weak, you won\u2019t get a better chance to buy if you are a dollar buyer. If people aren\u2019t looking at it now, they never will be.\u201d ITV Studios\u2019 biggest global hits 1. Hell\u2019s Kitchen: 196 countries 2. The Voice: 180 3. Victoria: 155 4. Poldark: 154 5.

      "bodyText": "Theresa May\u2019s adviser on the future of work says the boom in the gig economy could have a significant impact on government finances, with self-employed workers and contractors paying more than \u00a32,000 less a year on average in tax than employees doing equivalent jobs. Matthew Taylor, the former Downing Street policy expert who the prime minister has appointed to review modern employment practices \u2013 including in the fast-growing sector of app-based work for companies such as Uber and Deliveroo \u2013 said on Tuesday: \u201cThere is no question that the growth of self-employment and incorporation is having a significant impact on our revenues.\u201d It is not known how many of the UK\u2019s 4.7m self-employed workers are engaged in work that could also be classed as employment, but if only 10% were, that could imply an annual loss to the exchequer of close to \u00a31bn, according to the Guardian\u2019s estimate. The exchequer does not receive employer national insurance contributions on behalf of self-employed workers. Taylor\u2019s warning, as the review was formally launched, comes amid growing scrutiny of the employment status of workers in the gig economy. Last month, Uber, a taxi app relying on 40,000 self-employed drivers, lost an employment tribunal case when judges asserted that drivers should be classed as workers. That could mean Uber must pay national insurance contributions, as well as sick pay and paid holiday. Uber is appealing against the ruling. The chancellor, Philip Hammond, also warned last week of the \u201cstructural effect of rapidly rising incorporation and self-employment, which further erodes revenues\u201d. Writing in the Guardian, Taylor says Britain\u2019s employment system \u201chas weaknesses and is not future-proof\u201d, and adds that the gig economy is only set to grow. He says some retailers are considering adopting Uber-style self-employment models, and are asking whether \u201cthey need people employed to work a full shift in our shop and can instead have people on call who come in for an hour or two during busy periods\u201d. Taylor will report back to Theresa May next year on modern employment practices and says he is concerned about businesses which \u201cimpose the expectations and obligations of employees but, by defining workers as self-employed, deny them their due rights\u201d. Hermes, the parcel delivery giant which uses 10,500 self-employed couriers, is currently facing an HM Revenue and Customs investigation following multiple allegations from couriers that they should be classed as workers or employees rather than contractors. Several have said they are paid less than the national minimum wage. The government has also announced the first official study of its kind into the scale of the gig economy and the reasons people join it, and appointed three experts to Taylor\u2019s panel. They are Paul Broadbent the chief executive of the Gangmasters Licensing Authority, Greg Marsh, the founder of the web-based homes rental site Onefinestay, and leading employment lawyer Diane Nichol. From January to March the review will take evidence in public hearings across the UK in a tour planned to take in towns and cities including Glasgow, Coventry and Maidstone. The business minister Margot James said the government recognised the need to be open to innovative working, but said: \u201cIt is crucial that workers receive a decent wage and that people working in all sorts of jobs are able to benefit from the right balance of flexibility, rights and protections.\u201d Taylor also suggested that companies which lost employment tribunals should face automatic investigations to check whether illegal behaviour such as underpayment of the minimum wage or false self-employment were endemic. \u201cIf an employer is found to be paying under the minimum wage on one or more cases, it should be more automatic that we go in and find out if those behaviours are rife in that organisation,\u201d he said.",

      "bodyText": "Brussels is this week expected to confirm a crackdown on hordes of overseas firms that are together shipping 150m small parcels a year to European online shoppers without charging VAT \u2013 often illegally. The move comes as Europe\u2019s airports, rail freight terminals, and shipping container ports are deluged by record numbers of parcels ordered by Christmas shoppers on sites such as Amazon and eBay. The boom in overseas firms selling goods to Europe has been accompanied by an explosion in VAT fraud. In total, the European commission estimates \u20ac5bn a year is now lost in tax revenues \u2013 a figure that is rising annually at 15-20%. Many import firms are illegally underdeclaring the value of goods as they arrive in the EU, knowing that customs officers are overwhelmed and unable to make proper checks. A study published in May by Copenhagen Economics estimated that more than 60% of goods arriving into the EU with some postal carriers were failing to comply with VAT declaration rules. As well as fraudulent underdeclarations, some importers are able to legitimately avoid VAT if their goods are of low value (\u00a315 or less in the UK). There are about 150m such parcels arriving in Europe each year, all of them purporting to qualify for this low-value VAT exemption. Of these, however, many are believed to be fraudulently declared of low value. On Thursday, the commission will promise to bring this heavily exploited VAT exemption to an end. However, phasing it out will not be possible for at least another five years, when new software has been developed and deployed. By then, conservative Brussels forecasts estimate the number of parcels likely to be arriving in the EU, and purporting to be of low value, will have doubled to 300m. Separately, the commission is expected to confirm on Thursday that European VAT rules will be amended to allow member states to bring VAT rates for ebooks, online magazines and newspaper apps into line with hard-copy equivalents. In Britain and several other EU states, books and newspapers are currently zero-rated for VAT while online versions are not. A change in this area could make ebooks and online news subscriptions much cheaper.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Supermarket shoppers can pick up everything they need for Christmas dinner for eight people for less than \u00a320 this year, a survey has found. The cost of buying 11 Christmas dinner essentials \u2013 including a turkey, plum pudding, fresh vegetables and cranberry sauce \u2013 comes out at \u00a319.82, or \u00a32.48 a head, after shopping around for the best prices at Aldi, Lidl, Asda, Morrisons and Iceland, Good Housekeeping magazine found in its annual festive shopping basket cost survey. Good Housekeeping tracked the price of the 11 products across 10 major supermarket chains and found prices were the cheapest since it began its survey eight years ago. The overall cost has dropped 10.8% since 2009, when the price for Christmas dinner was \u00a32.78 a head. The reduced cost of groceries at Aldi and Lidl was the main contributor to the fall in the overall price of the Christmas dinner shopping basket compared to 2015, according to Good Housekeeping. Food prices generally have been driven down in recent years as the big four supermarkets \u2013 Tesco, Asda, Sainbury\u2019s and Morrisons \u2013 have reacted to the rise of German discounters Aldi and Lidl with aggressive price cutting. However, supermarkets have warned that prices are likely to rise next year as the falling value of the pound against the dollar and euro following the vote to leave the EU pushes up the price of imported products and ingredients. Of the 11 foods tracked by Good Housekeeping to provide a Christmas meal with all the trimmings, six have gone down in price, including turkey, and three have stayed the same as last year. Only the prices of Christmas pudding and mince pies have increased, as the price of imported raisins, butter, flour and sugar has jumped since 2015, due to a combination of factors including the collapse of the pound and weaker supplies. Aldi was the cheapest supermarket for those wanting a one-stop shop, where the ingredients for Christmas dinner for eight cost just \u00a322.03. Aldi\u2019s basket is 11% cheaper than last year\u2019s winner, Iceland, which this year falls to third place (\u00a324.81), behind Lidl in second place (\u00a324.57). The most expensive basket was from Marks &amp; Spencer (\u00a349.40) followed by Waitrose (\u00a340.02). \u201cSupermarket shoppers will be relieved to see Christmas essentials are still so affordable,\u201d said Caroline Bloor, the consumer director of Good Housekeeping. \u201cWhile five of the supermarkets have cheaper baskets this year, it\u2019s mainly thanks to the big decrease in the cost of these groceries at Aldi and Lidl that the overall basket is significantly cheaper. So think carefully where you shop or you could end up paying twice as much.\u201d Tony Baines, the joint managing director of corporate buying at Aldi, said: \u201cAt Aldi, our customers get the same quality as M&amp;S and Waitrose, but at prices significantly cheaper than Iceland. We know that this is more important than ever at Christmas time.\u201d This year\u2019s Christmas Dinner Index, from analysts Mintec, which compares the cost of a slightly different basket of products including turkey, vegetables and pork, found that the price of the festive meal rose by 1% year-on-year and is still lower than both 2013 and 2014. Potato prices rose 52% in the year to November, it said, as bad weather hit yields and delayed planting and harvesting, while similar conditions contributed to a 65% rise in onion prices. Parsnips were up 14%, but carrot prices were down year-on-year thanks to lower demand in Europe, where domestic supplies were higher. Strong demand in China and worries about lower production in the UK sent pork prices higher by 14% year-on-year. But that was offset by a 2% drop in turkey prices, which accounts for a larger proportion of the meal and weighs more heavily on the index. But Mintec warned shoppers that there could be further price rises ahead. \u201cIt is worth noting that prices are likely to rise in December as demand continues to increase,\u201d it said. \u201cSo stocking up on turkey and pork early is probably the best course of action.\u201d Good Housekeeping\u2019s \u00a32.48 a head Christmas dinner: the 11 ingredients Turkey: Asda \u2013 \u00a38 (2.8-4kg) Potatoes: Aldi \u2013 29p (2kg) Stuffing mix: Asda and Morrisons \u2013 30p (2 x 85g) Brussels sprouts: Aldi \u2013 58p (2 x 500g) Carrots: Aldi \u2013 29p (1kg) Parsnips: Aldi \u2013 58p (2 x 600g) Cranberry sauce: Lidl and Asda \u2013 55p (200g) Christmas pudding: Aldi and Lidl \u2013 \u00a33.49 (907g) Brandy butter: Aldi and Lidl \u2013 \u00a31.25 (200g) Mince pies: Lidl \u2013 \u00a31.49 (12 pack) Christmas cake: Iceland \u2013 \u00a33 (2 x 400g) Total \u2013 \u00a319.82 Cost of a one-stop Christmas shop Aldi \u2013 \u00a322.03 Lidl \u2013 \u00a324.57 Iceland \u2013 \u00a324.81 Tesco \u2013 \u00a328.08 Asda \u2013 \u00a329.68 Morrisons \u2013 \u00a331.12 Co-op \u2013 \u00a331.26 Sainsbury\u2019s \u2013 \u00a335.40 Waitrose \u2013 \u00a340.02 M&amp;S \u2013 \u00a349.40",

The overall cost has dropped 10.8% since 2009, when the price for Christmas dinner was \u00a32.78 a head.</p> <p>The reduced cost of groceries at Aldi and Lidl was the main contributor to the fall in the overall price of the Christmas dinner shopping basket compared to 2015, according to Good Housekeeping.</p> <p>Food prices generally have been driven down in recent years as the big four supermarkets \u2013 Tesco, Asda, Sainbury\u2019s and Morrisons \u2013 have reacted to the rise of German discounters Aldi and Lidl with aggressive price cutting.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"a5b479287f801a5eac4d310d3519ea258a4725d6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a5b479287f801a5eac4d310d3519ea258a4725d6/0_1153_4230_2846/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A typical Christmas dinner\" width=\"1000\" height=\"673\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A typical Christmas dinner.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dan Matthews for Weekend magazine</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>However, supermarkets have warned that prices are likely to rise next year as the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/aug/19/the-post-brexit-pound-how-sterlings-fall-affects-the-uk-economy\">falling value of the pound</a> against the dollar and euro following the vote to leave the EU pushes up the price of imported products and ingredients. </p> <p>Of the 11 foods tracked by Good Housekeeping to provide a Christmas meal with all the trimmings, six have gone down in price, including turkey, and three have stayed the same as last year. Only the prices of Christmas pudding and mince pies have increased, as the price of imported raisins, butter, flour and sugar has jumped since 2015, due to a combination of factors including the collapse of the pound and weaker supplies.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/aldi\">Aldi </a>was the cheapest supermarket for those wanting a one-stop shop, where the ingredients for Christmas dinner for eight cost just \u00a322.03.

The most expensive basket was from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/marksspencer\">Marks &amp; Spencer </a>(\u00a349.40) followed by <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/waitrose\">Waitrose</a> (\u00a340.02).<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>\u201cSupermarket shoppers will be relieved to see Christmas essentials are still so affordable,\u201d said Caroline Bloor, the consumer director of Good Housekeeping. \u201cWhile five of the supermarkets have cheaper baskets this year, it\u2019s mainly thanks to the big decrease in the cost of these groceries at Aldi and Lidl that the overall basket is significantly cheaper. So think carefully where you shop or you could end up paying twice as much.\u201d</p> <p>Tony Baines, the joint managing director of corporate buying at Aldi, said: \u201cAt Aldi, our customers get the same quality as M&amp;S and Waitrose, but at prices significantly cheaper than Iceland.

      "bodyText": "Consumer and business confidence tumbled in November amid concerns the UK economy would struggle to grow after a post-referendum slowdown, two surveys have found. Consumers were \u201cresolutely gloomy\u201d and viewed the economy with increasing despondency, while a broad range of businesses said they were worried the economic recovery after the Brexit vote was starting to recede. Conducted before last week\u2019s autumn statement, the surveys support the chancellor\u2019s warning that the UK was likely to confront \u201ca sharp challenge\u201d in 2017, as inflation eats into disposable incomes and limits consumer spending. The GfK consumer confidence index dropped five points after a two-point fall in October, taking it to minus eight. Despite recent strong retail sales, the index revealed a sharp nine-point drop in consumer plans for large purchases, spelling bad news for retailers as they gear up for the peak Christmas selling period. Car sales have dropped in recent months, and a further fall is expected as consumers shy away from committing themselves to purchasing major items while the impact of the referendum remains uncertain. Howard Archer, chief economist at IHS Global Insight, said: \u201cThe fundamentals for consumers seem certain to progressively weaken over the coming months, which will take a significant toll on confidence as well as ability to spend. It looks probable that inflation will move above earnings growth during 2017. \u201cAdditionally, we suspect that unemployment will rise over the coming months as economic activity weakens appreciably and business uncertainties are stoked by the government triggering article 50, thereby bringing likely difficult negotiations with the EU to the forefront.\u201d The index, compiled on behalf of the European commission, showed a two-point drop in confidence about respondents\u2019 personal finances over the past year and a four-point fall for the same measure looking to the year ahead. Questioned about their view of the general economic situation, respondents were disappointed with the last 12 months and circumspect about the next. The index covering most of 2016 dropped six points \u2013 19 points lower than this time last year \u2013 and fell five points for the year ahead. Joe Staton, head of market dynamics at GfK, said: \u201cThe slump across the board this month points to continuing uncertainty about the state of the economy among consumers. \u201cWe are viewing our economy over the past 12 months with increasing despondency. The decreasing score on the economy for the next 12 months also shows we are resolutely gloomy about the outlook despite strong GDP numbers.\u201d He added: \u201cMany are saying that fears about the British economy have been overstated but time will tell if the pessimism shown in the index is misplaced or not.\u201d UK business confidence levels decreased by five points in November, according to the business barometer compiled by Lloyds Bank Commercial Banking. This came after a six-month high in October. Lloyds said the decrease followed \u201ca significant decline in economic optimism, which fell 20 points to 14% from 34%, suggesting that the recovery following the EU referendum outcome is starting to recede\u201d. It said firms\u2019 reported theirown business prospects had improved to the highest level since January. \u201cThis was driven by 55% of firms who said that they expect their business prospects to improve in the coming year, while only 5% reported a weaker outlook,\u201d the bank said. Consumer services businesses were more optimistic than consumers, with a balance of 36% expecting a brighter year ahead compared with 25% last month. However, the business and other services sector fell by 17 points to 29%.",
