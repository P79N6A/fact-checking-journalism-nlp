      "bodyText": "Ryanair has been ordered to tell hundreds of thousands of passengers how it proposes to provide alternatives to cancelled flights by 5pm on Friday. As criticism of the Ryanair\u2019s treatment of affected passengers intensified, the aviation regulator told the Irish airline to explain how it will reroute passengers and email all those affected by Wednesday to explain their options. In a strongly worded letter, the CAA\u2019s chief executive, Andrew Haines, told Ryanair: \u201cThis issue is urgent, as passengers may already have been disadvantaged by taking a decision based on misleading information provided by Ryanair.\u201d Ryanair responded, saying it had reminded its customer service agents on Wednesday \u201cof the refund and re-accommodation entitlements of customers in cases of flight cancellations\u201d. But a Ryanair memo, seen by the Guardian, appears to instruct call centre staff that if offering flights with other carriers to do so provided the price \u201cdoes not exceed three times the value of the original Ryanair fare\u201d. The document was criticised by consumer group, Which? \u2013 its managing director Alex Neill said: \u201cRyanair appears to be plucking figures out of thin air as there is no legal basis for the arbitrary figure they\u2019ve set. \u201cThe law says passengers must be rerouted and there\u2019s no specified limit on cost. This yet again highlights the importance of the action which the Civil Aviation Authority has started.\u201d The CAA had said earlier that Ryanair had wrongly claimed it was not obliged to arrange new flights for passengers on rival airlines, and in his letter Haines spelt out that emails previously sent to passengers had \u201comitted material information\u201d about their rights. Ryanair came under scrutiny after announcing earlier this week that it would scrap 18,000 flights on 34 routes between November 2017 and March 2018, affecting nearly 400,000 passengers. The statement came a week after a first wave of cancellations was announced. Haines called on Ryanair to issue a press release explaining how it would reroute passengers, including a commitment to assist passengers who had already chosen an option that was not suitable for them as a result of being misled by the airline, and a promise to reimburse those affected. The latest intervention by the CAA \u2013 which has launched enforcement action against the Dublin-based carrier \u2013 came after criticism from Nicola Sturgeon, the Scottish first minister. She lamented Ryanair\u2019s \u201cdeeply regrettable\u201d decision to cancel scores of flights from Scotland, and backed the CAA\u2019s legal warnings to the airline over misleading passengers. \u201cI have serious concerns about the decisions taken by Ryanair in the past couple of days. These will cause disruption to many passengers travelling to and from Scotland to London, and indeed to other destinations in Europe,\u201d she told MSPs. \u201cWe fully support the CAA\u2019s launch of enforcement action because it is vital at the time of disruption that airlines provide full and accurate information about the rights that they [passengers] have.\u201d The Scottish transport minister, Humza Yousaf, was writing to the airline to protest against the cancellations, she said. Haines had earlier told the BBC he doubted that the dispute would end up in court, but said it was unacceptable that Ryanair was disregarding the law and customers\u2019 rights. \u201cThese are simple things to fix and they\u2019re choosing not to fix them,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople shouldn\u2019t have to choose between low fares and legal rights.\u201d In his letter, sent to Ryanair\u2019s chief legal officer, Juliusz Komorek, Haines said there would be a conference call with the airline on Monday to discuss why it was taking so long to respond to the regulator\u2019s requests. Ryanair\u2019s share price had lost little ground until Thursday, when it fell by more than 4% to \u20ac16.41 (\u00a314.39), leaving its stock market value nearly \u00a31.7bn lower than before the cancellations. In a brief statement issued before the CAA letter, Ryanair said it would cooperate with the regulator: \u201cWe are meeting with the CAA and will comply fully with whatever requirements they ask us to.\u201d The CAA\u2019s intervention means the company is now fending off the displeasure of investors, regulators, politicians, passengers, pilots and cabin crew, despite its chief executive, Michael O\u2019Leary, attempting to bring the rostering problem under control. According to EU regulations, airlines that cancel flights are obliged to offer a refund or reroute passengers under \u201ccomparable transport conditions\u201d. Guidelines state that this should be done as soon as possible, even if it has to be with another airline. Affected services include routes from Edinburgh and Glasgow to London Stansted, and from the Scottish airports to Poland, Spain and Germany. The disruption began the previous week, when Ryanair said it would scrap up to 50 flights a day until 31 October, citing a \u201cmess-up\u201d in how it schedules time off for pilots. The airline said it had emailed affected customers to offer a refund or an alternative flight. Passengers will also receive a travel voucher for a \u00a340 one-way or \u00a380 return journey that can be used to book a Ryanair flight for travel between October 2017 and March 2018.",

      "bodyText": "The tobacco firm Imperial Brands is working on a rescue deal for the wholesaler Palmer &amp; Harvey, which supplies tobacco to Tesco and other retailers. Palmer &amp; Harvey is the biggest cigarette supplier in the UK and employs 4,000 people. Imperial and Japan Tobacco International, which were involved in a refinancing round in early April and each gave Palmer &amp; Harvey a \u00a330m loan, are expected to provide enough funding to keep the firm afloat, allowing it to hammer out a rescue deal with Carlyle, a private equity firm. Imperial, maker of Davidoff and Gauloises cigarettes, said in a trading update that it was working with others to create a sustainable future for Palmer &amp; Harvey, stressing its \u201cclose trading relationship\u201d. Another key partner is Tesco, which accounts for about 40% of Palmer &amp; Harvey\u2019s revenues. Any rescue deal is expected to include an extension of the supermarket\u2019s three-year distribution deal with Palmer &amp; Harvey. The wholesale sector has been rocked by Tesco\u2019s \u00a33.7bn takeover of the cash and carry group Booker, which faces an in-depth investigation by the competition watchdog. Industry experts have warned that if Tesco shifts its business from Palmer &amp; Harvey to Booker, the former will not be able to compete. But Tesco could extend its contract with Palmer &amp; Harvey in an attempt to get its Booker takeover cleared by the Competition and Markets Authority. Based in Hove, East Sussex, Palmer &amp; Harvey supplies 12,000 products such as chilled foods and alcohol to 90,000 shops around the country, including large retailers, corner stores and petrol station forecourts. The business, which was launched in 1925, is owned by current and former employees. It is run by Tony Reed, a former Tesco executive who previously managed the supermarket\u2019s 3,000 convenience stores. Reed became chief executive of Palmer &amp; Harvey last October and is expected to stay on after the rescue deal.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Ikea has bought the gig economy odd-jobs company TaskRabbit, becoming the latest retailer to move into offering services alongside products. Jesper Brodin, the president and chief executive of Ikea Group, said the Swedish homeware chain was responding to increasing urbanisation and a shift to digital shopping that challenged traditional retail. \u201cWe need to develop the business faster and in a more flexible way. An acquisition of TaskRabbit would be an exciting leap in this transformation,\u201d he said. TaskRabbit, based in San Francisco and set up in 2008, operates in 40 cities in the US and the UK, connecting customers through its app with home maintenance tradespeople who can handle furniture assembly, decorating, cleaning and deliveries. Users flag jobs they want doing, and taskers, as the company refers to them, can select work nearby, apparently choosing the rate at which they will be paid. TaskRabbit will continue to operate as an independent company within the Ikea Group and link up with other retailers. The value of the deal was undisclosed. Ikea joins the likes of John Lewis and Debenhams in seeing services as a route to growth. John Lewis launched its Home Solutions service this month after signing up 150 independent tradespeople, all of whom were vetted by the department store. After being tested in Milton Keynes, the service is being extended to Bristol, Cardiff, Cheltenham, Gloucester and Taunton. Brodin said: \u201cWe will be able to learn from TaskRabbit\u2019s digital expertise, while also providing Ikea customers additional ways to access flexible and affordable service solutions.\u201d The acquisition takes Ikea into the gig economy, with TaskRabbit workers classed as independent contractors who work when they want, where they want and at rates they set, but are not necessarily entitled to a minimum wage or holiday pay. Other gig economy employers, including Uber and Deliveroo, have faced court action over the treatment of their workers, some of whom say they are not independent contractors and should receive holiday pay. The buyout comes after Ikea tested recommending TaskRabbit workers to assemble furniture for customers late last year at some of its London stores. TaskRabbit was founded by the former IBM software engineer Leah Busque. The company has struggled to expand and partnered up to offer its services via Amazon last year.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Sir Richard Greenbury, who has died aged 81, joined Marks &amp; Spencer at the age of 16 and rose to become chief executive and chairman. By the time he stepped down in 1999, he had worked for the company for 46 years. In the mid 1990s, under his chairmanship, it seemed that M&amp;S could do no wrong. The retailer, founded more than 100 years before by Michael Marks as a market stall in Leeds, dominated the high street; its management was held up as an example to other businesses; Greenbury was offered directorships by companies including ICI and British Gas. He enjoyed the company of other powerful chairmen, particularly Alex Ferguson, manager of Manchester United, and counted the then prime minister, John Major, among his friends. But Greenbury was an autocratic and abrasive chairman. He led M&amp;S to record success but failed to admit the need for change in a shifting fashion market, which precipitated a dramatic collapse in the company\u2019s fortunes. This would nearly cost M&amp;S its independence in the face of a bid from Sir Philip Green\u2019s Arcadia group in 2004. Rick Greenbury was born in Carlisle, the son of Richard and Dorothy (nee Lewis). The family spent six years in Leeds before moving to west London, enabling Greenbury, when his short temper was criticised, to claim, improbably, to be just a \u201cblunt Yorkshireman\u201d. His combative temperament showed early: at Ealing county grammar school he boasted of being the most caned boy in the school. His powerful frame made him a formidable competitor at football and tennis and brought a Slazenger sponsorship. But plans to further his sporting career at university collapsed after his parents split up and his mother was diagnosed with cancer. At 16, he was forced to find work as a packer in the Lillywhites sports store. \u201cAll my ambitions were destroyed and I found myself thinking life was very, very hard.\u201d He quarrelled with his boss but then answered an advertisement for management trainees at M&amp;S and joined the company in 1952 at its Ealing store. He made such enthusiastic use of company sporting facilities that he slipped two discs and had to wear a steel corset, which meant he failed his national service medical. He excelled at tennis but his tantrums during his 12 years representing Middlesex were still remembered when, to his delight, he was later elected a member at Wimbledon. Greenbury\u2019s liking for an argument marked him out among the ranks of careful M&amp;S staff. He even punched a customer, kept his job and was then promoted. He became a departmental manager in the flagship Marble Arch store, where his 6ft 2in frame caught the eye of the ageing chairman Simon Marks, son of the founder and later Lord Marks of Broughton, whose own aggressive style found an echo in Greenbury. Marks nicknamed him \u201cbig fellow\u201d, took him under his wing and moved him to head office as a trainee merchandiser. Throughout his career Greenbury drew on his experience of Marks\u2019s business acumen and his privileged access to the family. Marks died at his desk in 1964, after 48 years at the helm, but Greenbury\u2019s progress continued under the Sieffs, first Israel, Marks\u2019s brother-in-law, then Israel\u2019s son Marcus, who became chairman in 1972. Greenbury became an M&amp;S lifer, and met both his wives through the company. He worked in every department but made his name in knitwear. Detecting the trend to more casual dressing, he built up men\u2019s knitwear in close alliance with a supplier, Harry Djanogly, of Nottingham Manufacturing, whose company developed low-cost, machine-washable lambswool sweaters. Greenbury\u2019s success was recognised by appointment to the board at the age of 36. Six years later, in 1978, he became one of three joint managing directors. He was recognised as having an uncanny understanding of what would sell, but his manner was hard to take. When company Jaguars were regularly breaking down, he pressed the case for a switch to German cars \u2013 anathema to the founding families, with their commitment to British-made goods \u2013 by flinging down his company car keys and announcing he would buy a BMW on his own account. A fellow director said: \u201cRick always had to smash you. If you thought you had won a point, you found it had to be replayed at a later date.\u201d Those lower down were blunter: \u201cRick ruled by fear.\u201d The same had been said of Simon Marks, although the Sieffs were markedly more emollient. Greenbury was particularly effective at building relationships with suppliers, which powered the company\u2019s progress by developing new lines. One said: \u201cYou might doubt Rick\u2019s judgment but not his integrity.\u201d Appointed to run clothing in 1980, he reduced supplier numbers, encouraging mergers and rationalisations but ensuring there were large contracts for the survivors. By the early 90s, as he put it, \u201cinstead of 40 companies making ladies\u2019 blouses, we had six \u2013 but six very powerful and capable ones\u201d. When Lord (Derek) Rayner, the first chairman from outside the family, took over in 1984, Greenbury had already been marked as his successor. But a survey of directors by the meticulous Rayner unearthed concerns about whether he had strategic vision to match his undoubted operating ability. The question would recur. Nonetheless he was appointed chief operating officer in 1986 and chief executive in 1988, becoming chairman and chief executive in 1991. Profits had grown by only 2% in 12 months, after doubling in the previous five years. He acted quickly. Five thousand staff went in a year, mainly by natural wastage; suppliers were told to cut their margins, and the profitless chain of Canadian stores was sold off. In an \u201coutstanding value\u201d campaign, prices were cut or held and suppliers were encouraged to do more of their own product development. Rayner had been slow to open out-of-town stores but Greenbury accelerated the shift so that by the end of the 90s they accounted for a quarter of sales. Profits almost doubled again, to \u00a31.1bn in 1997. By 1996 M&amp;S\u2019s share had risen to 15% of the UK clothing market. He was knighted in 1992. In 1993 Greenbury was voted retailer of the year, and in 1997 he received the accolade of second most impressive industrialist (after Richard Branson) from 500 of his peers in Mori\u2019s annual survey of business leaders. Behind the scenes, Greenbury became more autocratic. He enjoyed the traditional chairman\u2019s right to veto or change clothes designs at a twice-yearly fashion parade. But he rarely visited stores of expanding rivals such as Next, while his initial reluctance to buy offshore meant that his staff were markedly less experienced in dealing with foreign manufacturers than their rivals. Outside boards found he had little to say except about M&amp;S. More alarmingly, even in good times, the thin-skinned Greenbury was acutely sensitive to comment by journalists and financial analysts. His favourite verbal retort, \u201cI have never heard such absolute rubbish,\u201d was mild compared to his furious written refutations, nicknamed \u201cRickograms\u201d. Although apparently at his peak, he claimed that 1995 and 1996 were the worst years of his life. His second marriage broke up (he blamed his workaholic lifestyle), he suffered from a painful arthritic hip and he faced pillorying from the press as chairman of the CBI\u2019s inquiry into executive pay. It was a mark of his insularity and surprising unworldiness that he had allowed himself to be persuaded by Major to head the committee following an outcry over \u201cfat cat\u201d increases at British Gas. He was unprepared to be targeted when stories broke about executive excess; unhappy chairing a committee of prominent businessmen whom he could not dominate; embarrassed when the report\u2019s recommendations were attacked by business for red tape and by unions for failing to tackle large increases. He complained of media harassment of his family. Had he been able to read the future, he said, he would never have taken the assignment. As he reached 60, his reluctance to anoint a successor caused increasing difficulty. Senior executives began to jockey for position. His cautious but controlling management (\u201cI didn\u2019t create anything. I was a caretaker. I believed absolutely in the founding principles\u201d) was producing record results. But lack of strategic vision came back to haunt him. Competitors had learnt from Marks, and there were warning signs. By 1997 M&amp;S clothing was increasingly seen as unexciting while a decision to expand by buying 19 Littlewood stores was made just before an economic downturn. His downfall was dramatic. Results declared in May 1998 at \u00a31.1m were widely praised but had been boosted by special items and unusual price increases. By September it was clear that there had been a collapse in sales, unforeseen by the management. In November, Greenbury reported a 23% profit fall. A few days later his deputy chairman, Keith Oates, wrote an astonishing letter to board members claiming things were much worse and that they should appoint him as chief executive. Greenbury flew back from business in India to board meltdown. Oates went but the non-executives insisted that a new chief executive be appointed and Greenbury become non-executive chairman. Their choice, Peter Salsbury, considered a Greenbury supporter, made clear he wanted things done his way and resented Greenbury\u2019s interference. The two clashed repeatedly and six months later Greenbury resigned. It was a brutally rapid demotion \u2013 from hero to zero in 14 months \u2013 and Greenbury found it difficult to understand or to admit where he had gone wrong. \u201cIt\u2019s painful,\u201d he told an interviewer. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t be human if I didn\u2019t feel frustrated, but the people who count have stood by me.\u201d After stepping down, his corporate life was limited. He served on the supervisory board of Philips Electronics and was a director of Electronics Boutique, a chain of video game stores. Meanwhile his old company struggled in the fashion market against competition from retailers such as Primark and Next, which it had been slow to anticipate. It narrowly resisted a takeover from Arcadia Group in 2004, but in spite of a series of management reshuffles and attempts at relaunches the company has never regained the commanding position it enjoyed under Greenbury\u2019s chairmanship. He met his first wife, Sian Hughes, while she was doing a temporary job at the M&amp;S store in Edinburgh. They married in 1959, had two sons and two daughters, divorced and then remarried in 1996 \u2013 after his divorce from his second wife, Gabrielle McManus, whom he had met as a buyer in London and married in 1985. He is survived by Sian and his children. \u2022 Richard Greenbury, retailer, born 31 July 1936; died 27 September 2017",

      "bodyText": "Two comments on my letter concerning the use of People\u2019s Quantitative Easing to buy out PFI (27 September) in your paper on 28 September require a response. Martin Wheatcroft says that the Bank of England reserve deposits of our clearing banks, which is where most QE funds are now located, have interest paid on them, meaning that People\u2019s QE is not costless, and that cost could rise, considerably. He makes three mistakes. First, interest is only paid by Bank of England discretion. It could withdraw or limit it. Second, he quotes nominal and not inflation-adjusted interest rates, and it is adjusted rates that matter overall for People\u2019s QE because they indicate the real cost. Third, he assumes UK interest rates will rise without QE being unwound, and that is exceptionally unlikely. His scenario will not come to pass: if rates were as high as he suggests there would be no QE-generated funds in the Bank of England on which interest would be due. Tim Worstall also makes a mistake. He says big business does not use gilts for cash management. That\u2019s true if nominal ownership of long-term funds is taken into account. But that\u2019s because big business only makes use of these gilts overnight, when the massive \u201crepo\u201d market, which places the cash of these companies on deposit while the world sleeps, makes extensive use of, and is entirely dependent upon, the availability of government-backed gilts to make that market work. My critics are making use of highly selective and unrealistic evidence. I stand by my arguments. Professor Richard Murphy Professor of practice in international political economy, City, University of London; Director, Tax Research UK \u2022 I have never been a chartered accountant, but I am a gardener. The dispute between Richard Murphy and Martin Wheatcroft over \u201cPeople\u2019s QE\u201d seems to me to turn on the question of who tends and who owns the magic money tree garden, the chancellor of the exchequer or the governor of the Bank of England. The magic money that funds quantitative easing, once in circulation, effectively redeems the debt (the \u201cpromise to pay the bearer\u201d is met). At that point the paper debt becomes pure fiction, the waters muddied only by the question of which part of the state apparatus, the government or its putatively independent central bank, ultimately owns it. Just as the government sets the Bank\u2019s remit, it can \u2013 if necessary, through act of parliament \u2013 instruct it to write off the debt.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "His soft West Midlands accent betrays the fact that Ranjit Singh Boparan has not ventured far from his roots during a career in food. But in business terms he has travelled miles. The entrepreneur, who left school at 16 with few qualifications and spent his early working life toiling in a local butcher\u2019s shop, founded 2 Sisters Food Group in West Bromwich in 1993 with a bank loan, and has since grown the firm into the UK\u2019s second largest food business by turnover. He and his wife, Baljinder Kaur Boparan, have made an estimated \u00a3544m, according to the Sunday Times rich list, while maintaining many of the core chicken operations around his old West Midlands base. The empire created by 51-year-old Ranjit Singh Boparan, known as the \u201cchicken king\u201d, employs 23,000 people and supplies the major supermarkets. The founder says this growth has been built on a daily focus on working \u201ctirelessly to produce good quality, safe food at an affordable price\u201d. Apart from chicken, the acquisitive Boparan has also swallowed the turkey producer Bernard Matthews, Fox\u2019s Biscuits, Goodfella\u2019s pizza and Matthew Walker, the world\u2019s oldest Christmas pudding maker \u2013 as well as the restaurant chains Harry Ramsden, FishWorks, Giraffe and the Cinnamon Collection. Such a sprawling empire \u2013 owned via a variety of different vehicles \u2013 has propelled him into the business elite and attracted some star names to sit on his board. 2 Sisters\u2019 parent company \u2013 Boparan Holdings \u2013 is chaired by Lord Allen, the former chief executive of Granada and ITV, as well as a one-time non-executive director of Tesco. Lady Neville-Rolfe, another former Tesco board member, who was commercial secretary to the Treasury until the summer, also served as a director of the company, while the former Sainsbury\u2019s boss Justin King was an adviser. A more secretive businessman than Boparan would be hard to find. He insists on a low public profile and \u201cdoesn\u2019t do interviews with the media\u201d, as one adviser put it bluntly to the Observer six years ago when the entrepreneur was acquiring Northern Foods. However, there have been some public statements. In a rare appearance when collecting an honorary degree in 2015 from Nottingham Trent University, which lauded him for steering his business \u201cinto the vanguard of food safety\u201d, Boparan outlined his business philosophy. It included soundbites on how you should treat \u201cwork as a hobby\u201d, but \u201cof course get paid loads of money doing it\u201d and how \u201cif you keep doing the same thing you\u2019ll get the same results\u201d. He added: \u201cWork isn\u2019t work. It\u2019s fulfilling a dream. It\u2019s making a difference. Work is a journey. Every day we face challenges. You will learn something every day. \u201cAdapting to change is crucial. The world is moving at a fast pace. Never stop listening. Never stop learning. Set stretching goals. Reach for the sky. In life there are two types of individuals. There are book readers and there are book writers. There are 99% of us who read books. There is only 1% of us who write books. Be the book writer.\u201d The company\u2019s own books show it turned over \u00a33.1bn in its most recent full year, making an operating profit of \u00a390.5m. After taking into account exceptional items, interest and tax, that skinny profit turned into a loss of \u00a31.4m, all of which illustrates how tight the margins can be when your main customers are the major supermarkets.",

      "bodyText": "\u201cHave you just got out of prison?\u201d the slaughterhouse foreman asks his new recruit. It is a question seemingly posed in jest, but probably only to mask a genuine suspicion that a spell in clink is the most likely explanation for an odd situation. The new boy stands out because he is a rare Briton reporting for stomach-churning, minimum-wage work at an intensive chicken processing plant in Devon, where his typical colleague is eastern European and speaks almost no English. This reliance on immigrant labour is hardly a unique situation within UK industry, but it is a striking feature of 2 Sisters Food Group, a giant \u00a33bn-revenue food processor that produces industrial quantities of the country\u2019s favourite meat. Every week a sizeable chunk of the company\u2019s 23,000 workers \u2013 drawn from 36 different nationalities \u2013 churns out 6 million chickens, part of an operation that produces a third of all the poultry products consumed in the UK. Its products are found on the shelves of the major UK supermarket groups. This summer, two undercover reporters for the Guardian and ITV News were among its workforce. One journalist spent 12 days working inside the 2 Sisters portioning and packing plant in West Bromwich, while the other was employed for three days at this slaughtering facility in the village of Willand, about 20 miles north of Exeter. The slaughterhouse At Willand, chickens, still living but seemingly catatonic, arrive packed into green and yellow plastic latticed crates on the back of lorries, where they are routinely comforted by animal rights activists, wishing to say goodbye to \u201c5,000 lost chicken souls\u201d. The doomed animals are then driven into the complex and gassed en masse, before being hung by their legs on metal brackets, to connect them to an elevated mechanical rail. The rail transports these birds, blood dripping from their open beaks, to the next stage in the process, in a half-comical scene that partially resembles a theme park ride. Suddenly, the animals dip out of sight. They are inside a machine. The next you see of the birds, they are still riding the rollercoaster, only now they are completely naked. They had entered an aluminium tunnel of perhaps 30 metres in length where jets of hot water stripped them of their feathers. By the time they emerge, the birds look almost like those you see on a supermarket shelf \u2013 only with feet intact, featuring swollen and splayed digits. Some chickens also emerge with heads still just about clinging on for the ride. Some of the work is much more hands-on. As the chickens get plucked, the discarded feathers and heads drop below to a conveyor belt, travelling back in the opposite direction towards a human tasked with spotting unusual mounds in the layers of feathers. If he spies a hump, that means a chicken has fallen from its hooks and is buried under the mass. Using his hands, the worker must burrow through the piles of soaking, stinking plummage and extract the stray dead bird \u2013 before clicking on a tally counter to record what he is throwing away. Meanwhile, chicken heads also drop from the sides of the machine to the floor, where another minimum-wager sweeps or sprays them into a waste gulley. This team works in temperatures hovering around the high 20s celsius. It feels even hotter when you are wearing a lab coat, a full-length plastic apron, wellington boots, rubber gloves and a hair net or beard snood \u2013 all of which protect you from most of the spraying blood, and lord knows what else. But the smell and the memory of what you witness is more stubborn than the body fluids. For days afterwards, a piece of litter on the pavement looks, just for a split second, as though it is a chicken head. Almost any odour is redolent of the slaughterhouse. All of which might explain why 2 Sisters workers tend to trot out the refrain: \u201cI have stopped eating chicken.\u201d That is fairly standard for those who work in the meat industry. But the disagreeable work does not end at the \u201ckilling department\u201d, which is merely a staging post on these birds\u2019 commercial journey. The production line 2 Sisters Food Group has numerous slaughterhouses spanning the country from Coupar Angus in Perth and Kinross, down to Willand, all of which supply the company\u2019s array of production lines preparing chicken for our supermarkets. Crates of slaughtered birds are shipped to the processing facilities for portioning, packing and dispatch. These include production lines at Willand, where more overhead rails whisk freshly slaughtered chickens into chilled factories, where they are then released down aluminium chutes into square receptacles at the start of a series of production lines. The first worker is tasked with grabbing chicken after chicken from the pile and thrusting them \u2013 sort of legs akimbo \u2013 on to the vertical probes that move steadily down the line. The bird is then transported towards a sequence of workers who include cutters \u2013 one hand holding a knife, the other sporting a chainmail glove \u2013 who portion off the breast, and skinners \u2013 some of whom can whip the skin off a chicken almost as easily as pulling a sock from a foot. The conveyors never seem to stop. The first spot in the production line is, as many colleagues like to remind you, a simple job. But while the task of placing chickens on to moving probes is certainly less skilled than the cutting, it still has its challenges: the birds are slippery to pick up, the work is relentless and you are using muscles rarely called on in any other part of life. These workers \u2013 the lowest of the low on the production line \u2013 will be handling some 6,000 chickens a day, assuming they do this job for a 10-hour shift. The result, at least for beginners, is intensely sore wrists and hands, coupled with sharp pains shooting up the forearms for days after a shift. It is totally shattering work. There is a strange pressure to the job, too. Put the chicken on the probe in a manner that displeases the first cutter and he will growl and curse at you. Miss a probe with your bird and a supervisor barks at you. Sometimes the novice gets told playfully: \u201cHey, baby, why you miss so much?\u201d but, more often, it is simply a bawl of: \u201cSTOP MISSING!\u201d So you stretch and strain to avoid both the rollickings and the slower, subtler humiliation of an empty probe chugging accusingly all the way down the line. \u201cThis is no good job,\u201d says a new starter, who still returns to the factory to do it all again the following day. And he is right, in perhaps more ways than he has yet to figure. West Bromwich The chickens moving down this type of production line have been slaughtered the day before they are portioned \u2013 or, at least, that is the theory. At the group\u2019s production line in West Bromwich, our reporter saw evidence of the batch of fresh meat being topped up with older stock, with birds piled up in solid plastic baskets at the start of the line. The footage shows the labels on these crates stating that the contents have been slaughtered five days earlier. A chicken crown on the floor is also seen being retrieved and thrown back onto the production line - despite the abundance of signs around the factory reminding workers of their training saying this is strictly against the company\u2019s policy. But neither of the company warnings, or the old dates, seemed to matter: everything went on to the fresh line. Then there is other chicken, which even some workers might never know is older than it seems. Just off from the production lines is a cool storeroom, which is filled with pallets that are stacked about two metres high with baskets, each of which contains about 25 chicken crowns. We saw evidence of how they stay there for a day or more before being edged out to the production line, by which time the birds\u2019 histories can be rewritten. It is here, out of sight of internal quality assurance inspectors \u2013 known as QAs \u2013 that the Guardian and ITV filmed an occasion of the seemingly non-negotiable date of the birds\u2019 slaughter being switched. That results in the paperwork saying the product is fresher than it really is. The record of where the birds were slaughtered is also altered, leaving them almost impossible to trace and recall in the event of a food scare. This practice looks wrong to an untrained eye \u2013 and to a professional one too. Ask quality assurance experts if it is acceptable and you get a no-nonsense confirmation. \u201cThat is totally wrong,\u201d says one. Our reporter saw it at Site D, perhaps as part of a culture where fulfilling a client\u2019s order trumps following the rules. \u201cI previously worked at [another food company],\u201d one worker explains. \u201cThere, if there was a QA around, everyone was alert. At 2 Sisters, there is no respect for QAs.\u201d One QA tells of being physically pushed out of the way when trying to prevent chicken being loaded on to a lorry for dispatch, and getting called away by a supervisor after putting crates of chicken on hold and finding the meat had then been packed when they returned. The company says this view does not represent the real picture in the company as a whole. It said of its 33 quality assurance staff in West Bromwich: \u201c2SFG has reviewed its records for Site D from the previous twelve months and there are no complaints from any Quality Assurance staff resembling those cited.\u201d There certainly are diligent QAs who succeed in catching problems. They stop chicken portions from being dispatched when the packaging is damaged or the meat looks to be of poor quality. The supermarkets\u2019 own quality departments, based in their distribution centres, also send packets back to 2 Sisters plants. That does not mean the meat is unfit to eat, so it does not always stay back in the plant for long. \u201cChicken comes back to the factory and we are asked to open the packets, remove the portions and place them into the large plastic trays that are used to move chicken about the factory,\u201d says one worker. Meanwhile, the sight of chicken already packed for the supermarket being reopened next to the production line and tossed back on to the fresh conveyor belt is unremarkable. It might have been sent back by internal 2 Sisters quality staff, or a supermarket distribution centre, but to a shop floor worker it looks all the same. \u201cSometimes, if shop no selling, sending back, open again,\u201d explains one operative. 2 Sisters said that it takes \u201cthese allegations extremely seriously\u201d and that it had launched an investigation. It said that it had not been given enough information or time to investigate the evidence properly but it said its West Bromwich facility had received nine audits, five of which were unannounced, in the months of July and August alone. It added: \u201cHygiene and food safety will always be the number one priority within the business, and they remain at its very core\u201d. Other times, chicken already packaged for one supermarket is reopened and mixed with pieces being packed for a rival. The undercover footage shot by the Guardian and ITV captures one such instance, with the drumsticks at the end of the line showing up in packets saying they have come from Tesco\u2019s Willow Farms. Willow Farms is the bucolic invention of Tesco\u2019s promotional department, but if the branding feels contrived, the marketing goes further. Willow Farms chicken is billed as being \u201creared exclusively for Tesco\u201d on the grocer\u2019s website, which suggest that the supermarket group is unaware. Meanwhile 2 Sisters explains it thus: \u201cThe Willow Farms brand is exclusive to Tesco, but the raw material is not. 2SFG meets the raw materials specifications for the Willow Farms brand.\u201d All of which ties in with another common phrase among the 2 Sisters workforce. \u201cIt\u2019s all the same chicken,\u201d they say, again and again. \u201cIt\u2019s all the same chicken.\u201d Additional reporting by Olivier Acu\u00f1a",

This summer, two undercover reporters for the Guardian and ITV News were among its workforce.</p> \n<p>One journalist spent 12 days working inside the 2 Sisters portioning and packing plant in West Bromwich, while the other was employed for three days at this slaughtering facility in the village of Willand, about 20 miles north of Exeter.<br></p> \n<h2>The slaughterhouse </h2> \n<p>At Willand, chickens, still living but seemingly catatonic, arrive packed into green and yellow plastic latticed crates on the back of lorries, where they are routinely comforted by animal rights activists, wishing to say goodbye to \u201c5,000 lost chicken souls\u201d.</p> \n<p> The doomed animals are then driven into the complex and gassed en masse, before being hung by their legs on metal brackets, to connect them to an elevated mechanical rail.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--supporting\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2017/09/boparan-in-numbers-zip/giv-3902Gxj6Ef9I5Ve3/\" data-alt=\"2 Sisters in numbers\"> \n <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2017/09/boparan-in-numbers-zip/giv-3902Gxj6Ef9I5Ve3/\">2 Sisters in numbers</a> \n</figure> \n<p> The rail transports these birds, blood dripping from their open beaks, to the next stage in the process, in a half-comical scene that partially resembles a theme park ride.

They had entered an aluminium tunnel of perhaps 30 metres in length where jets of hot water stripped them of their feathers. By the time they emerge, the birds look almost like those you see on a supermarket shelf \u2013 only with feet intact, featuring swollen and splayed digits. Some chickens also emerge with heads still just about clinging on for the ride.</p> \n<p> Some of the work is much more hands-on.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The largest supplier of chicken to UK supermarkets has been tampering with food safety records in moves that could dupe consumers into buying meat past its use-by date. An investigation by the Guardian and ITV News recorded undercover footage of workers altering the slaughter date of poultry being processed at a 2 Sisters Food Group plant. The group produces a third of all poultry products eaten in the UK and supplies top grocers including Tesco, Sainsbury\u2019s, Marks &amp; Spencer, Aldi and Lidl. When informed of the evidence, all five retailers responded to say they would launch immediate investigations. The discovery comes just four years after the 2013 horsemeat scandal, which has resulted in prison sentences for those convicted of a conspiracy to pass off cheaper horsemeat as beef. Experts said the practice of changing \u201ckill dates\u201d could artificially stretch the commercial life of meat products by triggering the food processor to print incorrect use-by dates on supermarket packaging. Workers at the company confirmed they had been asked to switch these labels on other occasions. It is illegal to place incorrect use-by dates on food, which are set for safety reasons and differ from \u201cbest before\u201d dates. The joint investigation, which involved taking secret recordings during a spell of 12 working days inside 2 Sisters\u2019 plant in West Bromwich, also captured evidence that: \u2022 Chicken portions returned by supermarket distribution centres are being repackaged by 2 Sisters and sent out again to major grocers. \u2022 Workers drop chickens on the floor of the processing plant and return them to the production line. \u2022 Workers alter records of where chickens were slaughtered, potentially hindering authorities from recalling contaminated meat during food scares. \u2022 Chickens slaughtered on different dates are mixed on the production line. Workers said use-by dates printed on the packets of the mixed chicken tended to reflect the age of the freshest, rather than oldest, meat in the batch. Having been shown the evidence, Prof Chris Elliott, a food safety academic from Queen\u2019s University Belfast who led the UK government\u2019s independent review of food systems following the 2013 horsemeat scandal, said: \u201cOver the past three to four years I have conducted many inspections of food businesses right across the UK. I have never seen one operate under such poor standards as your video evidence shows. \u201cI think [this] absolutely calls out for a full investigation. We need to get environmental health officers, we need to get the Food Standards Agency to do a thorough investigation. The Food Standards Agency will take this very seriously. They will look at the premises and see if there are grounds to close the facility down.\u201d The company said it had not been given enough time or detail to respond to the allegations, which it described as \u201cfalse\u201d. A letter from 2 Sisters Food Group\u2019s legal advisers, Schillings, said: \u201cFood safety and hygiene are 2SFG\u2019s top priorities. To the extent that you have identified any shortcomings (which is not admitted), these could only be isolated examples which our clients would take very seriously, and they are investigating the allegations made.\u201d During the course of the investigation, the Guardian and ITV interviewed more than 20 workers at 2 Sisters about standards within the company. One worker said: \u201cI have [changed the slaughter dates] lots of times when I was working in that area. My supervisor, he asked me do it \u2026 If you are buying fresh chicken it can be older chicken.\u201d A second worker claimed that 2 Sisters quality control staff in the West Midlands were working in a \u201cpointless job\u201d and could feel intimidated and be overruled by production supervisors who treated them as \u201cenemies\u201d. On one occasion the Guardian/ITV footage captured workers altering the \u201ckill date\u201d of hundreds of chickens to one day later at the group\u2019s West Bromwich plant in August. Other workers added that they had witnessed dates being altered by more than a day. Supermarket products typically have a use-by date around 10 days after the bird has been slaughtered. Speaking about how chicken is returned by supermarket distribution centres, a third 2 Sisters worker said: \u201cThey will repack [the returned meat] like [it is] today\u2019s production ... It is sent back on [the line] like today\u2019s production. They mix it with today\u2019s production.\u201d Supermarkets return chicken to suppliers for a variety of reasons that can include packaging and labelling errors. Being returned does not mean it is unfit to eat. However, if older meat is mixed with fresher meat, the use-by date should reflect the age of the oldest meat in the batch. A fourth worker added: \u201cI try to make them change the [use-by] date to [reflect the] older DOK [date of kill] but that doesn\u2019t happen \u2013 they mix.\u201d The footage shows chicken that has been processed and packed for Lidl being reopened and mixed with other pieces of poultry. The drumsticks re-emerge at the end of the line showing in packets saying they have come from Tesco\u2019s Willow Farms. The labelling on the pack says the contents are \u201creared exclusively for Tesco\u201d. Schillings said: \u201cThe Willow Farms brand is exclusive to Tesco, but the raw material is not. 2SFG meets the raw materials specifications for the Willow Farms brand.\u201d The Guardian and ITV showed the undercover footage to four government meat inspectors, who would speak only on condition of anonymity. All of them said they believed the film showed potential breaches of food regulations. Food law experts also added that the film amounted to prima facie evidence that the company had potentially committed offences. Dr Richard Hyde, an expert in food law at Nottingham University, added: \u201cIf you are placing a use-by date that is incorrect that is a breach of law. If you place food on the market that doesn\u2019t have the correct traceability information that is a criminal offence. There are a basket of potential offences here that the regulators need to look at and decide whether further action is required.\u201d The food processor said that Elliott and Hyde had not visited 2 Sisters sites or considered its policies, so their comments \u201ccannot be, in any way, objective expert evidence, but are completely unbalanced, based on biased selective information\u201d. 2 Sisters Food Group is the UK\u2019s second largest food company by turnover and claims to process around 6 million chickens every week. It is owned by Ranjit Singh Boparan and his wife, Baljinder Kaur Boparan, and the chicken operations \u2013 which include 12 sites in the UK \u2013 are part of a sprawling \u00a33bn food empire that separately includes the turkey producer Bernard Matthews, the restaurant chains Harry Ramsden, FishWorks and Giraffe, plus food brands such as Fox\u2019s Biscuits and Goodfella\u2019s pizza. The Boparans, who have always shunned publicity, are worth \u00a3544m, according to the Sunday Times rich list. The company added: \u201c2SFG ensures all staff are fully trained on hygiene and safety matters, and enforces a number of policies to ensure compliance with all regulations. It is subject to regular audits in these areas and staff have a number of ways in which to voice their concerns. \u201c2SFG has reviewed its [whistleblower hotline] records for Site D from the previous 12 months and there are no complaints from any quality assurance staff resembling those cited.\u201d The five big supermarkets supplied by 2 Sisters\u2019 West Bromwich plant all said they took quality and safety standards very seriously and were investigating. A Tesco spokesperson said: \u201cWe operate to the highest possible food quality and safety standards, carrying out our own regular audits at all of our suppliers to ensure these standards are maintained. As such, we take these allegations extremely seriously and will be carrying out our own rigorous investigation.\u201d A Lidl spokesperson said: \u201cLidl UK takes the issue of food safety extremely seriously and, as such, we conduct independent audits to ensure that our high quality and safety standards are met. Therefore, we are very disappointed to learn of these allegations and will be urgently investigating this matter with the supplier.\u201d Additional reporting by Olivier Acu\u00f1a.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Gordon Brown has said the Bank of England will be vulnerable to populist demands to \u201ctake back control\u201d unless elected politicians accept joint responsibility for heading off future financial crises. The former prime minister called for the creation of a joint Treasury-Bank strategic oversight group to assess risks to the economy, saying it was unfair for Threadneedle Street to be blamed for policy failures in areas it did not control. Speaking at a conference to mark 20 years since his decision to grant the Bank independence in 1997, Brown said the shock announcement within five days of Labour being elected had been vindicated. But he said the backlash against globalisation prompted by the financial crisis meant leaving decisions solely to experts was not feasible. The Bank should also not meddle in areas that were the exclusive preserve of politicians, Brown said, launching a strong public attack on its calls for action to reduce Britain\u2019s budget deficit during the deep recession of a decade ago. Brown said the Bank had been too slow to cut interest rates during 2008, leaving them at 5% when the economy was in recession. He added that the contrast with the more proactive approach taken by the US central bank, the Federal Reserve, was \u201calmost unbelievable\u201d, but he had kept quiet for fear of jeopardising the still fragile independence of the Bank. \u201cA few months later, the Bank was trying to tell the government what to do about fiscal policy,\u201d Brown said, adding that Labour had needed to cut taxes and raise public spending because Threadneedle Street had refused to act under its then governor, Mervyn King. It was \u201cunacceptable\u201d for the Bank to attempt to instruct ministers in how to handle fiscal policy, especially in the changed political climate since the financial crisis, he added. \u201cIf we do not understand that in an democratic system you\u2019ve got to get the right balance between expertise, accountability and leadership, then anti-globalisation protests will rise,\u201d Brown said. As a result, those people who are taking decisions, perhaps even the right ones, will be blamed as the \u201ctake back control\u201d movements gain even more support in the years to come. Brown said a fresh financial crisis would expose the lack of global cooperation and weakness of the G20. Countries had been retreating into national silos since 2010, Brown said, adding: \u201cWhile there is now improved supervision of financial standards, reform must be intensified to prevent a future financial crash. \u201dIf, for example, the next financial crisis comes out of Asia, and if, as likely, because of problems that arise from a shadow banking system in commercial and industrial lending, we will ask ourselves next time: \u2018Why did we not act after 2008 to create a better global early warning system and make our financial regime more fully coordinated globally?\u2019 \u201cThese decisions to act cannot be left to bankers alone. Britain and the world urgently needs to get the balance right between the need for expertise, the need for proper accountability, and the need for effective leadership. There will be no hiding place for the G20 or any government the next time.\u201d The former chancellor George Osborne gave the Bank sole responsibility for financial stability after abolishing Brown\u2019s tripartite oversight system, in which responsibility was shared by the Treasury, the Bank and the Financial Services Authority. But Brown said it was wrong for there not to be a strategic oversight group that involved the Treasury, noting that there were sectors of the economy, such as the supply of houses, where the Bank had no control. \u201cYou can\u2019t have stability without the Bank, but you can\u2019t have stability without the Bank and the Treasury working together, either,\u201d he said. \u201cNo matter how superhuman the governor is, it is not fair to leave the Bank exposed in this way.\u201d Brown said he had been planning the Bank\u2019s independence for two years before the 1997 general election. He added that the depoliticisation of interest rates had kept Britain out of the single currency, because it had created a better monetary regime than that of the eurozone. \u201cIndependence for the Bank of England has been not just been a technical success, but also avoided many of the problems that might have taken us into the euro early, and pushed us out of the euro very quickly afterwards,\u201d he said.",

      "body": "<p>Gordon Brown has said the Bank of England will be vulnerable to populist demands to \u201ctake back control\u201d unless elected politicians accept joint responsibility for heading off future financial crises.</p> <p>The former prime minister called for the creation of a joint Treasury-Bank strategic oversight group to assess risks to the economy, saying it was unfair for Threadneedle Street to be blamed for policy failures in areas it did not control.</p> <p>Speaking at a conference to mark 20 years since his decision to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/1997/may/07/economy.uk\">grant the Bank independence</a> in 1997, Brown said the shock announcement within five days of Labour being elected had been vindicated.</p> <p>But he said the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/jul/14/globalisation-the-rise-and-fall-of-an-idea-that-swept-the-world\">backlash against globalisation</a> prompted by the financial crisis meant leaving decisions solely to experts was not feasible.</p> <p>The Bank should also not meddle in areas that were the exclusive preserve of politicians, Brown said, launching a strong public attack on its calls for action to reduce Britain\u2019s budget deficit during the deep recession of a decade ago.</p> <p>Brown said the Bank had been too slow to cut interest rates during 2008, leaving them at 5% when the economy was in recession. He added that the contrast with the more proactive approach taken by the US central bank, the Federal Reserve, was \u201calmost unbelievable\u201d, but he had kept quiet for fear of jeopardising the still fragile independence of the Bank.</p> <p>\u201cA few months later, the Bank was trying to tell the government what to do about fiscal policy,\u201d Brown said, adding that Labour had needed to cut taxes and raise public spending because Threadneedle Street had refused to act under its then governor, Mervyn King. </p> <p>It was \u201cunacceptable\u201d for the Bank to attempt to instruct ministers in how to handle fiscal policy, especially in the changed political climate since the financial crisis, he added. </p> <p>\u201cIf we do not understand that in an democratic system you\u2019ve got to get the right balance between expertise, accountability and leadership, then anti-globalisation protests will rise,\u201d Brown said.</p> <p>As a result, those people who are taking decisions, perhaps even the right ones, will be blamed as the \u201ctake back control\u201d movements gain even more support in the years to come.</p> <p>Brown said a fresh financial crisis would expose the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/aug/06/decade-after-financial-meltdown-underlying-problems-not-fixed\">lack of global cooperation</a> and weakness of the G20. Countries had been retreating into national silos since 2010, Brown said, adding: \u201cWhile there is now improved supervision of financial standards, reform must be intensified to prevent a future financial crash.</p> <p>\u201dIf, for example, the next financial crisis comes out of Asia, and if, as likely, because of problems that arise from a shadow banking system in commercial and industrial lending, we will ask ourselves next time: \u2018Why did we not act after 2008 to create a better global early warning system and make our financial regime more fully coordinated globally?\u2019</p> <p>\u201cThese decisions to act cannot be left to bankers alone. Britain and the world urgently needs to get the balance right between the need for expertise, the need for proper accountability, and the need for effective leadership. There will be no hiding place for the G20 or any government the next time.\u201d</p> <p>The former chancellor George Osborne gave the Bank sole <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2010/jun/16/george-osborne-city-fsa-banking\">responsibility for financial stability</a> after abolishing Brown\u2019s tripartite oversight system, in which responsibility was shared by the Treasury, the Bank and the Financial Services Authority.</p> <p>But Brown said it was wrong for there not to be a strategic oversight group that involved the Treasury, noting that there were sectors of the economy, such as the supply of houses, where the Bank had no control.</p> <p>\u201cYou can\u2019t have stability without the Bank, but you can\u2019t have stability without the Bank and the Treasury working together, either,\u201d he said. \u201cNo matter how superhuman the governor is, it is not fair to leave the Bank exposed in this way.\u201d</p> <p>Brown said he had been planning the Bank\u2019s independence for two years before the 1997 general election. He added that the depoliticisation of interest rates had kept Britain out of the single currency, because it had created a better monetary regime than that of the eurozone.</p> <p>\u201cIndependence for the Bank of England has been not just been a technical success, but also avoided many of the problems that might have taken us into the euro early, and pushed us out of the euro very quickly afterwards,\u201d he said.<br></p>",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Time for a recap. The Bank of England has marked its 20th year of independence by hearing a string of warnings that central bank autonomy is at risk. Former MP Andrew Tyrie outlined seven reasons why support for giving central banks control of monetary policy was fading. They include rising support for nationalism, and concerns that quantitative easing has made inequality worse. His concerns were echoed by other experts. Dame DeAnne Julius summed up the problem with QE - most people don\u2019t understand it, or don\u2019t think it is credible. Instrument independence was good when people understood what the instrument was and how it worked. Once you go from buying government bonds to buying corporate bonds to loosening credit through things like funding for lending, and mixing that up with what\u2019s going on on the macroprudential side \u2013 where it can look like the bank is pushing lending with its interest rates policy but pulling it back with its regulatory policy \u2013 things get much more complicated. Frances O\u2019Grady of the TUC warned that politicians are keen to use central bankers as human shields. Veteran central banker Stanley Fischer had wise advise for today\u2019s policymakers - always be vigilant, and keep away from political influence if you want to remain independent. The day began with Mark Carney arguing that BoE independence would help it to protect the UK from the consequences of the Brexit vote, but wouldn\u2019t be able to stop real incomes falling. Prime minister Theresa May grabbed the early attention, with a speech designed to push back against Labour\u2019s criticism of free market economics. My colleague Polly Toynbee wasn\u2019t impressed. Nor was one of the men who pushed BoE independence: May also intensified the pressure on Boeing, over the Bombardier tariffs row. Former PM Gordon Brown also had a stern warning; that populism will undermine support for central bank independence, and could spark a new financial crisis. Brown also argued that BOE independence had helped keep the UK out of the euro, as he took a few digs at former governor Sir Mervyn King. That\u2019s all for today; thanks for reading and commenting. GW Costas Milas, professor of finance in the University of Liverpool\u2019s Management School, has co-authored some interesting research into inflation targeting - a key theme of today\u2019s Bank of England conference. This work examined whether adopting inflation targeting has made a significant difference to the persistence and variability of inflation. As this chart shows, different countries got to grips with inflation at different speeds. In several countries, including the UK, inflation was calmed before the central bank got independence. The study also found that inflation-targeters have not necessarily been more successful than non-inflation targeters in making inflation less persistence and/or reducing the variability of inflation. Instead, the most important factor that determines the success in taming inflation, is the quality of the institutional framework within which Central Banks operate. So if a country\u2019s government is effective, with a properly independent civil service, it is easier to bring inflation into line Professor Milas explains that this has lessons for the future: Our results do not argue against inflation targeting policies. Rather, we view the quality of central banks and institutions as a vital element in ensuring economic and financial stability in the aftermath of the recent financial crisis and the current attempt by Central Banks to gradually raise near-zero policy rates in order to return to economic \u2018normality\u2019. More details here. Over in Athens, there is relief that the IMF has signalled that it will not take such a tough position on Greek banks as expected. Helena Smith reports: Addressing the Financial Times Investment Management summit in London earlier, Poul Thomsen, who heads the Washington-based body\u2019s European department, said the IMF wasn\u2019t overly worried about the Greek banking system\u2019s stability. Thomsen said: \u201cOn the subject of the Greek banking system, let me emphasize that we see no financial stability concerns at all in Greece.\u201d Regular readers will recall that earlier this week we reported on Greek bank shares nosediving on the back of recapitalisation fears following the IMF\u2019s demand for an asset quality review. On Monday ECB chief Mario Draghi raised the spectre of multiple stress tests which would highlight Greek lenders\u2019 huge non performing loan portfolio. But Thomsen insisted that Greece\u2019s four systemic banks were still in dire need of a medium-term strategy for the management of bad debt. \u201cWe need to be sure that there is a strategy to deal with Greece\u2019s exceptionally high levels of non-performing loans over the medium term,\u201d he said. Stanley Fischer takes a few questions: Q: How does a central bank maintain its independence? By being independent of political influence, and always acting as a technocratic institution. Q: Would the Bank of England have been able to take such unconventional actions in recent years if it hasn\u2019t been given independence? History shows that governors can generally take actions which aren\u2019t legally within their remit, in times of crisis. Q: How dangerous is Donald Trump, given the progress made in financial regulations since the financial crisis? Fischer declines to answer, as he\u2019s still on the Federal Reserve board. He points out that he discussed this with the Financial Times in August (he said it was \u201cdangerous and extremely short-sighted\u201d to unwind regulations). The watchword of a central banker should be be \u201cSemper Vigilantes\u2019, Fischer concludes. Always be vigilant. Because history and financial markets are masters of the art of surprise, as we have found out to our cost more than once. And never say never, because you will find yourself having to do things that you never thought you would. Fischer also warns his audience against assuming that laws can be changed quickly if a crisis breaks out. He reminds them that the US House of Representatives dramatically voted down TARP (the Troubled Asset Relief Program, created to rescue Wall Street). Fischer was governor of the Bank of Israel at the time, watching the vote with colleagues. One of them remarked that \u201c[Fed chief] Mr Bernanke didn\u2019t look very happy\u201d as the plan was rejected (triggering an almighty selloff on Wall Street). A week later, though, TARP was approved - so policymakers can get there in the end.... Stanley Fischer says it\u2019s important not to underestimate the importance of reversing the stimulus measures introduced after the 2008 crisis. After a long career in central banking, Stanley Fischer is retiring from the Federal Reserve next month. And to celebrate his career, Mark Carney is presenting Fischer with a rare figurine of a pink-coated Bank of England doorman. Fischer begins with a joke about a military parade, in which artillery and soldiers are followed by a platoon of economists carrying clipboards. \u201cWhy are the economists marching\u201d, one observer asks. \u201cYou should see the damage they can do\u201d, the military chief replies solemnly. That\u2019s why central banks need to be contained within their own space, Fischer smiles. You can watch Fischer\u2019s speech online here. Back at Fishmonger\u2019s Hall, Otmar Issing, the ECB\u2019s first chief economist, is warning that central banks should resist launching \u2018helicopter money\u2019 operations. Mark Carney was correct to warn today (see 9.21am) that Brexit is the most important factor on the UK economy, says Mihir Kapadi, CEO of Sun Global Investments. He adds: His statement indicates perhaps that the Bank of England no longer feels it has the full autonomy it has been enjoying over the last 20 years in determining the monetary policy. It now feels constrained by an external factor \u2013 the EU\u2019s relationship with post-Brexit Britain... As the BoE marks 20 years of political independence today, the current Brexit period points to new period of great uncertainty for the Bank In other economic news... Ireland remains on track to be the fastest-growing economy in the European Union for the fourth year in a town, according to Investec Economics. It is forecasting Irish GDP to rise to up to 5% by the end of this year and growth of 4.4% next year. Unemployment in the Republic will fall to 6.1% of the Irish labour force - it\u2019s lowest rate since June 2008 just before the financial crash. Investec\u2019s Dublin based economist Philip O\u2019Sullivan said: \u201cWe see this progress continuing over the coming years, with unemployment on course to fall to just 4.5% by 2019.\u201d But, O\u2019Sullivan also warned Brexit could still pose a key threat to the Irish economy especially given that a sixth of all Irish exports go to the UK - Ireland\u2019s biggest trading partner. The benign Investec forecast comes less than a fortnight before the next Irish budget from the Fine Gael minority coalition in Dublin. This pick-up in US growth to 3.1% per year is a boost to Donald Trump, argues Alex Lydall, Head of Dealing at Foenix Partners. He writes: After a more bullish Federal Reserve meeting this month the tide appears to be turning at a crucial point, with Mrs Yellen and Trump seemingly singing to the same chorus. With growth on the upward trajectory and inflation perhaps not causing the headache some Fed officials cited earlier in the year, the US is firing on almost all cylinders coming into year-end. There are also signs that US car sales have picked up, says Paul Ashworth of Capital Economics. The most encouraging news of the day is that the advance indicators report suggests wholesale inventories increased by a very strong 1.0% m/m in August, with retail inventories increasing by an even bigger 1.2%. The latter was driven by a 1.7% m/m increase in motor vehicle inventories. Vehicle sales were hit by Harvey in late August but, according to preliminary estimates, it appears that the destruction of vehicles during the storm has led to a sizeable rebound in vehicle sales in September. Just in: America\u2019s economy grew a little faster than previously thought this summer. US GDP grew by an annualised rate of 3.1%, the Commerce Department reports, up from a previous estimate of 3.0%. But... the number of Americans signing on for jobless benefit has risen to 272,000 in the last week, up from 260,00 previously. That\u2019s partly because of hurricane Irma, which caused severe disruption in Florida and Georgia. Here\u2019s the full text of Gordon Brown\u2019s warning that government\u2019s risk \u201csleepwalking\u201d into another financial crisis, unless they create a better early-warning system. \u201cWhile there is now improved supervision of financial standards, reform must be intensified to prevent a future financial crash. \u201dIf, for example, the next financial crisis comes out of Asia - and if, as likely, because of problems that arise from a shadow banking system in commercial and industrial lending, we will ask ourselves next time: Why did we not act after 2008 to create a better global early warning system and make our financial regime more fully-co-ordinated globally? \u201cThese decisions to act cannot be left to bankers alone. Britain and the world urgently needs to get the balance right between the need for expertise, the need for proper accountability and the need for effective leadership. There will be no hiding place for the G20 or any government the next time.\u201d Brown\u2019s solution is three-fold: Create a strategic oversight authority for UK financial stability, combining expertise from the Treasury and the Bank of England enhanced leadership by the G20 in delivering a global early warning system better global co-ordination of the interconnected globally-banking system across all financial centres, including in Asia. The former UK PM also warned that the Treasury can\u2019t keep \u201cwashing its hands\u201d of responsibility for financial regulation, and dumping it all on the Bank of England. He fears that the BoE will struggle when the next crisis comes. Brown also predicts that protests against globalisation will \u201conly grow\u201d if people think the \u201celite\u201d are taking decisions without proper accountability. Breaking away from the Bank of England conference.... Ryanair is in hot water after announcing a second series of flight cancellations yesterday. Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland\u2019s first minister, has attacked Ryanair\u2019s \u201cdeeply regrettable\u201d decision to cancel scores of flights from Scotland and backed the CAA\u2019s legal warnings to the airline over misleading passengers about their rights. Speaking during first minister\u2019s questions on Thursday, Sturgeon said the Scottish government\u2019s transport minister, Humzah Yousaf was writing to the airline to protest at its suspension. Ryanair has cancelled Scottish services to London Stanstead, and to airports in Poland, Spain and Germany, amongst 18,000 flights it has dropped. Around 400,000 passengers are affected. Sturgeon told MSPs: \u201cI have serious concerns about the decisions taken by Ryanair in the past couple of days. These will cause disruption to many passengers travelling to and from Scotland to London and indeed to other destinations in Europe.\u201d She added: \u201cWe fully support the CAA\u2019s launch of enforcement action because it is vital at the time of disruption that airlines provide full and accurate information about the rights that they have.\u201d Sturgeon was responding to attacks from Patrick Harvie, co-leader of the Scottish Green party on her proposals to firstly cut by 50% and then scrap air passenger duty in Scotland, using Holyrood\u2019s new tax powers. Harvie said scrapping APD would benefit the wealthiest most, and were \u201cunwanted, unnecessary and unsupported by any evidence\u201d. Gordon Brown ends his session by defending his tripartite system (which was found wanting in 2007). And he does it with another pop at the Bank of England under Mervyn King\u2019s leadership, insisting that the BoE was still responsible for spotting a crisis. Brown insists: The bank was still in charge of strategic financial thinking.... What failed was the implementation of the regime. I suspect we may hear more about this when Gordon\u2019s new book hits the news stands.... Brown also warns that laws introduced to avoid a new financial crisis are being pushed back in America: Chris Giles of the Financial Times\u2019s isn\u2019t impressed by Gordon Brown\u2019s criticism of the Bank of England in 2007. Brown is now criticising the Bank of England for failing to cut interest rates faster when the financial crisis began in 2007, when he\u2019d become prime minister. He says he thought interest rates were too high, but kept his mouth shut because he didn\u2019t want to undermine independence. The BoE\u2019s failure, Brown says, forced the government to act quickly with fiscal measures when the crisis broke. A few months later, the Bank was trying to tell the government what to do about fiscal policy, says Brown a little bitterly (a pop at former governor Lord King, I think). Brown says that a joint \u201cstrategic oversight group\u201d should be set up, with officials from the Treasury and the Bank of England. That would look for economic problems and issues where the government needs to act, such as in the housing market. It should be more formal than the old (discredited) Tripartite system, Brown adds. Otherwise, Brown says, the Bank of England is being exposed by the government, and left to try to fix problems alone. Gordon Brown claims that granting the Bank of England independence in 1997 helped to keep Britain out of the eurozone. He says that pre-independence, the debate about the euro was that Britain should give up on the relatively unstable regime in the UK, and go for the anchor provided by the euro and particularly the Bundesbank. After independence, that debate changed - there was a stable economic regime in the UK too, and with a more pro-growth policy than the eurozone. Brown says: Independence for the Bank of England has been not just been a technical success, but also avoided many of the problems that might have taken us into the euro early, and pushed us out of the euro very quickly afterwards. It certainly also avoided tensions between a Labour chancellor and the governor of the Bank of England, if the government had still set borrowing costs each month. Gordon Brown is enjoying his trip down Memory Lane. He says he had to phone the press after his historic announcement to make sure they understood it (apparently reporters were more interested that he\u2019d also raised interest rates). Brown also reminds us that the Conservative Party voted against the plan, and for several years promised to reverse independence when they got back into power. Brown explains that Labour kept their plans secret until after the 1997 general election, to avoid interest rates becoming politicised. He says that the Conservative government had resisted raising interest rates before the election, even though the Bank was recommending tightening monetary policy. Gordon Brown then explains how the Labour government decided to hand independence to the Bank of England, in an attempt to end short-term planning in the UK. Brown also makes a joke about how, in the past, reports of \u2018England collapsing before lunch\u2019 could apply to the cricket team or the pound. Gordon Brown, the man who gave independence to the Bank of England, is now giving his views. Brown homes in on one of Andrew Tyrie\u2019s points - that public concerns over globalisation threaten central bank independence. If we do not understand that in an democratic system you\u2019ve got to get the right balance between expertise, accountability and leadership, then anti-globalisation protests will rise. And those people who are taking decisions, perhaps even the right decisions, will be blamed as \u201ctake back control\u201d movements gain even more support in the years to come. Andrew Tyrie, the former (highly regarded) chair of the parliament Treasury committee, is now speaking at the BoE\u2019s conference on bank independence. He warns that the benefits of independence been eroded over time, and gives seven reasons why: A large proportion of the population don\u2019t remember the \u2018ghastly\u2019 effects of inflation. The Bank of England has been given an indemnity by the Treasury to allow its asset purchase scheme; there\u2019s a risk that this will create political interference. People are very aware of the distributional consequences of policies introduced to fight deflation, namely QE. The widening of the Bank\u2019s responsibilities after the financial crisis means it can be blamed for problems in a wider part of the economy, such as housing policy Central bank independence was underpinned by a wider consensus of how to run the economy, and the benefits of globalisation. That is now under political attack in many western economies Central banks are vulnerable to the wider loss of trust in institutions across the board Populist nationalism and socialism both have room to breathe in many western countries, and neither of them sit easily with central bank independence. So what can the Bank of England do? Tyrie says it must resist being overloaded with responsibilities, and it must remain accountable and keep explaining to the public what it is doing. And he ends with a stern reminder of the Bank\u2019s role in the 2008 financial crisis. The Bank failed us when the crash came. There was groupthink. They were part of the same groupthink as everyone else. It\u2019s parliament\u2019s job...to make sure that groupthink does not take root, and hack away at it when they see it. Frances O\u2019Grady, head of the TUC, says there has been a rise in the number of \u201cpretty poor quality employment, and underemployment\u201d in UK since the financial crisis. There\u2019s also been a rise in unsecured household debt, everyone should pay a lot of attention to that. She criticises \u201ccounter-productive policies, such as austerity and seven years of pay freezes\u201d, pointing out that this sacrifice wasn\u2019t volunteered. O\u2019Grady then warns the BoE\u2019s conference that politicians aren\u2019t always on their side, and will blame monetary policy for the state of the economy. One of the risks for the Bank is there are unrealistic expectations for the bank\u2019s role in dealing with a much bigger set of problems. There\u2019s also a problem that politicians sometimes use central bankers as human shields, rather than facing up to the political choices they should be making. [O\u2019Grady doesn\u2019t single any politician out, but nearly a year ago Theresa May did blame the Bank of England for making people poorer] Dame DeAnne Julius, a founder member of the Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of England, warns that central bank independence is being threatened by policies such as quantitative easing. She is telling the BoE\u2019s conference that the move into \u2018unconventional monetary policy\u2019 is a danger, as it makes it harder to persuade the public that the central bank is doing the right thing. QE is much more complicated than just raising or lowering interest rates, and it\u2019s much harder to prove that it has worked. As Dame Julius puts it: Instrument independence was good when people understood what the instrument was and how it worked. Once you go from buying government bonds to buying corporate bonds to loosening credit through things like funding for lending, and mixing that up with what\u2019s going on on the macroprudential side \u2013 where it can look like the bank is pushing lending with its interest rates policy but pulling it back with its regulatory policy \u2013 things get much more complicated. We all know that the more complicated things get, the less credibility experts have, she concludes. If you missed Mark Carney\u2019s speech, here\u2019s a clip of the BoE governor explaining how the Bank will steer the economy through Brexit. Guy Debelle concludes by pointing out that central bank independence can be improved, and that government policy also has an important role to play in balancing the impact of monetary policy. Guy Debelle then takes a swipe at critics of central bank independence. The deputy governor of the Royal Bank of Australia argues that central bankers are in the dock for issues that aren\u2019t really their fault. My view is that inflation targeting and central Bank independence are being blamed for economic outcomes that are not a consequences of either of them, but rather those outcomes are a consequence of our understanding or misunderstanding of how the economy operates. Legitimate criticism of central bank\u2019s understanding of the economy can be made, but that does not delegitimise the overall economic framework. But what about the \u2018distributional consequences\u2019 of monetary policy -- the fact that stimulus programme such as QE have made the rich richer? Debelle argues that monetary policy has always had this issue - changing interest rate makes some people richer, and others poorer. Plus, unemployment is the biggest cause of economic inequality [this is often played as a trump card from central bankers, but it ignores the fact that many jobs created since the financial crisis are low paid or insecure]. But has central bank independence worked? RSA deputy governor Debelle points out that inflation has certainly been low since the 1990s - ironically, inflation is now \u201ctoo low\u201d in some places. That\u2019s why some critics claim that bank independence is a solution to yesterday\u2019s problem. But, Debelle explains that Ed Balls (Britain\u2019s light-footed former UK shadow chancellor) has conducted research showing that two decades of data backs up Debelle and Fischer\u2019s 1994 paper on the issue of central bank independence. Debelle points out that independence has held firm; bank targets haven\u2019t been changed just to catch up (or down) with inflation, and there is little discussion about setting interest rates to match the political life cycle (ie, to create growth before an election). Here\u2019s Guy Debelle explaining how central banks moved towards independent inflation targeting in the 1990s. Debelle cites the danger of allowing politicians to run economies \u2018too hot\u2019 in the run-up to an election. It\u2019s still a risk in emerging markets, even if all advanced economies have handed independence to their central banks. And here\u2019s a slide from his presentation. Guy Debelle, Deputy Governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia, is now discussing the road to central bank independence. Back in 1994, he and Stanley Fischer cowrote a paper examining how independent a central bank should be. Debelle says they concluded that central banks should be \u201cgoal dependent, but instrument independent\u201d. In other words, politicians should tell central banks what to aim for, but give them the freedom to adjust monetary policy as they saw fit to reach their goal. The next question is about the Bombardier-Boeing trade dispute, following the shock news that America is slapping a 219% tariff on Bombardier jets (partly made in Northern Ireland). May says Boeing\u2019s behaviour isn\u2019t acceptable. We have a long-term partnership with boring, in various parts of government. This is not the kind of behaviour we expect from a long term partner, and it undermines that partnership. On a broader note, May also warns that \u201caspects of protectionism\u201d are creeping in in parts of the world. She wants the UK to be a champion of free trade. Onto questions. Our economics editor Larry Elliott asks Theresa May about her criticism of the Bank of England\u2019s ultra-low interest rates and quantitative easing. What will she do about it? May says governments must what they can to mitigate the impact of loose monetary policy, where necessary, and she cites the government\u2019s efforts to support savers. Low interest rates are good news for borrowers, but not savers. Here\u2019s a video clip of Mark Carney explaining how the Bank will use all its powers to mitigate the risks created by Brexit (as covered here). As predicted, Theresa May is now defending free market economics - but also admitting that it doesn\u2019t work as well as it should. For too long, too many communities have not seen the benefits of prosperity, she says. That waste of potential is bad for the economy as a whole.. But she then insists that free markets need to be improved, not abandoned as in Venezuela. My argument has always been, if you want to improve a system that has delivered unparalleled benefits, then you must address its faults, May insists. If you don\u2019t, you risk a return to the \u2018failed ideologies of the past\u2019 This includes high inflation at home, and trade wars abroad, the PM continues (a timely warning, given the row between Bombardier and Boeing that is threatening thousands of jobs in Northern Ireland). Our Politics Liveblog is tracking all the key points: Theresa May is now speaking. She jokes that when she applied to the Bank, as a geography graduate, she\u2019d asked to work in its international department. Instead, they put her in the economic intelligence department! (this doesn\u2019t get much of a laugh, unfortunately). May reminds her audience that UK inflation got as high as 22% in the 1980s, before Bank independence. The fact that sounds so outlandish shows what progress has been made. But she also points out that problems developed during the Bank\u2019s early years of independence, which came to light in the financial crisis. She blames the \u2018tripartite\u2019 system set up by former chancellor Gordon Brown (splitting responsibilities the Bank of England, the Financial Stability Authority, and the Treasury). As May puts it: Tripartite regulation did not prove a success. It failed the country during the financial crisis and we\u2019ve had to live with the consequences ever since. [She\u2019s referring to the collapse of Northern Rock, and the nationalisation of Royal Bank of Scotland and HBOS, followed by the deepest recession in decades] Mark Carney wraps up by welcoming Theresa May - and joking that she gave up the chance of a good career at the Bank to enter Westminster. As some of you may know, the Prime Minister began her career as a new graduate at the Bank before leaving after six years to pursue other interests \u2013 ultimately politics. Whilst at the Bank, the Prime Minister worked in the Economic Intelligence Department \u2013 then the cutting edge of our activities. During her time she accomplished great things and was destined for much more. Just imagine what could have become of your career, Prime Minister, if you had stayed at the Bank: you could have been in Fishmongers Hall... Carney then cites May\u2019s achievements: After the formation of the coalition government in 2010, she would become the longest- serving Home Secretary in over 60 years. During that period, she confronted many of society\u2019s biggest challenges \u2013 for example introducing legislation to tackle domestic violence, to eradicate modern slavery and to counter terrorism. Never afraid of a challenge, she stepped into the breach to become Prime Minister following the referendum. Carney then warns that Brexit is the biggest single issue facing the UK economy (see earlier post for the full quotes) Mark Carney then points out that independence gives central bankers the freedom to deviate from their inflation targets in times of trouble. That includes today, as Britain plots its exit from the EU. Carney warns that he can\u2019t prevent Brexit hitting the public\u2019s real incomes (ie, making us poorer). But he can try to limit job losses, by allowing inflation to run over target. As Carney puts it: In exceptional circumstances like today when the economy is facing profound structural change, the MPC can extend the horizon over which it returns inflation to target from above in order to balance the effects on jobs and activity. After all, even though monetary policy cannot prevent the weaker real income growth likely to accompany the transition to new trading arrangements with the EU, it can influence how this hit to incomes is distributed between job losses and price rises. Carney also acknowledges that the Bank was \u201cfundamentally reformed after the crisis\u201d, creating a new Financial Policy Committee to address financial stability issues. [That\u2019s because the collapse of Northern Rock shows the weaknesses in the \u2018tripartite\u2019 system set up by Gordon Brown] Mark Carney then declares that the gains from independence since 1997 have been \u201cenormous\u201d. He argues that the Bank played a vital role in the financial crisis, and can now help the UK get through its exit from the European Union. In the two decades that followed independence, inflation averaged just under 2% compared with over 6% in the preceding two. It\u2019s been one-fifth as volatile. Crucially, independence allowed monetary policy to respond boldly and effectively to the biggest financial crisis in a century. And it leaves the Bank well placed to address a range of possible developments around Brexit. Carney then hails Gordon Brown\u2019s \u2018bold decision\u2019 to give the Bank of England operational control for setting monetary policy in 1997. He reminds his audience of The Bank of England Act of 1998 which clarified the Bank\u2019s responsibilities - for the first time and only time in three centuries. Carney says the Bank is now accountable to the public and parliament, and jokes that he couldn\u2019t get away with blaming a decision on his \u201cinstincts\u201d, as former governor Montagu Norman once tried. [To learn more about Norman, do read the brilliant Lords of Finance, which explains how central bankers helped created the Great Depression] Carney reminds his audience of Britain\u2019s economic travails since World War Two. Achieving low inflation is easier said than done. Prices were anything but stable during the 1970s and 80s. With the collapse of Bretton Woods in 1971, UK monetary policy lost its nominal anchor. There followed a series of botched experiments, with targets for incomes, monetary aggregates and the exchange rate. The costs of such failures were enormous, with prices rising by 750% in the twenty-five years to 1992, more than over the previous two hundred and fifty years. Unemployment was high and growth volatile. The inflation target rose from the ashes of the ERM debacle twenty five years ago this month, marking the point when price stability became the unambiguous objective of UK monetary policy. This culminated in the \u201cthe ashes of the ERM debacle twenty five years ago\u201d, when Britain gave up trying to peg sterling to the Deutschmark. That\u2019s when the UK became unambiguously aiming for price stability, but even that wasn\u2019t a full success. It simply wasn\u2019t fully credible as the chancellor, Ken Clarke, was setting rates. The danger is that politicians promise low inflation, then go for faster growth, and end up delivering neither. And we\u2019re off! Governor Mark Carney is speaking first. Carney begins by explaining how price stability (ie, stable inflation) is the best contribution that monetary policy can make to the public good. High inflation hurts the least well off in society the most. It distorts price signals, inhibits investment, and ultimately damages the productive capacity of our economy. Equally, deflation imperils growth and employment, and, in the extreme, leads to financial ruin and economic collapse. So ideally, you want \u201clow, stable and predictable inflation\u201d, Carney continues. Just enough to \u201cgrease the wheels of the economy\u201d by encouraging people to spend, while giving space to central bankers to act when an economic shock hits. Attendees are gathering in Fishmongers\u2019 Hall for the Bank\u2019s conference, which is running a little late. I guess Theresa May\u2019s late addition to the schedule may be causing a few problems.... As well as defending Bank independence, Mark Carney is also warning that Britain\u2019s economic prosperity depends on the deal to leave the European Union. Here\u2019s the key section from his speech, which will be delivered shortly. The biggest determinants of the UK\u2019s medium-term prosperity will be the country\u2019s new relationship with the EU and the reforms it catalyses. Most of the necessary adjustments are real in nature and therefore not in the gift of central bankers. The Bank will do everything it can to support adjustment consistent with its statutory obligations. We will continue to assess and express our independent assessment of the risks associated with Brexit. We will also use all our powers, consistent with our remits, to mitigate those risks and to smooth the adjustment to new opportunities. Monetary policy will be set to achieve the inflation target in a way that helps smooth real adjustment in the economy and supports jobs in the wake of very large external forces. Banks will be capitalised so that they can withstand any severe shock that could be associated with Brexit \u2013 however unlikely \u2013 and still meet demand for credit. The financial system as a whole will have the capacity to finance the transition and the opportunities beyond. These are the best contributions the Bank of England can make to the good of the people of the United Kingdom. Labour MP Rachel Reeves, who chairs the Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy Select Committee, tweets: Correction, it seems that Mario Draghi isn\u2019t taking part in the BoE\u2019s conference (the ECB president was initially scheduled to close the event on Friday afternoon). The Bank of England has been rather reluctant to heave away at the levers of monetary policy in recent years. They\u2019ve been on hold for over a year, at 0.25%, after almost a decade at just 0.5%. But last night, the Bank\u2019s chief economist Andy Haldane hinted that a rate rise was close, and would be \u201cgood news\u201d. Haldane told Sky News that: This would be a sign of the economy healing, and therefore adjusting to that healing process. So rather than being a source of fear or trepidation, this ought to be a good news story about the economy proving resilient.\u201d The Bank of England\u2019s remit is to keep UK inflation under control. Originally the target was 2.5%, later cut to 2%. As this tweet from the Treasury shows, the BoE did well for the first decade, but then struggled once the financial crisis struck.... But...things were even worse in the 1980s, when interest rates were being set to protect the value of the pound (a policy that came unstuck on Black Wednesday). Here\u2019s another photo from the 1990s (spot a young Mervyn King on the front row). Helpfully, the Bank of England are streaming their two-day conference: Prime minister Theresa May will kick off the Bank of England\u2019s conference this morning, with a full-throated defence of free markets. In a rebuttal to Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, May will argue that a well-regulated open economy is the route to higher living standards, rather than state control. May is expected to tell the BoE that: \u201cA free-market economy, operating under the right rules and regulations, is the greatest agent of collective human progress ever created. It was the new combination which led societies out of darkness and stagnation and into the light of the modern age. It is unquestionably the best, and indeed the only sustainable, means of increasing the living standards of everyone in a country.\u201d Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. A gaggle of the world\u2019s top central bankers and other luminaries have descended on the City of London to help the Bank of England mark its 20th year of independence, and plot the way ahead. Over the next two days BoE governor Mark Carney will be joined by Mario Draghi (ECB) , Stanley Fischer (US Federal Reserve), Guy Debelle (Australia), Karnit Flug (Israel), Christine Lagarde (IMF), Mohamed El-Erian (Allianz) and Ed Balls ( Strictly Come Dancing Harvard Kennedy School). Ed Balls, of course, was a driving force behind the surprise decision to grant the Bank of England independence back in 1997. Gordon Brown, then chancellor, shocked the City and Westminster by announcing that he would hand control of interest rates to the BoE. Later today, Brown will look back on that landmark decision to give Threadneedle Street operational control of monetary policy. As my colleague Larry Elliott reported at the time: Mr Brown said last night that the objectives of policy were \u2018high and stable levels of employment and growth\u2019, the same as they had been in the 1940s when the Bank was nationalised, but added: \u2018It is right in the 1990s to deal with them in modern ways.\u2019 Mark Carney is also likely to defend criticism of the Bank\u2019s independence. Some argue, powerfully, that central bankers now have too much power, and are exacerbating wealth inequality through policies such as quantitative easing. Last year, Ed Balls co-authored an academic paper on this, and arguing that a new \u201csystemic risk\u201d committee should be set up to oversee some of the Bank\u2019s activity. As he put it: \u201cI think the case for independent central banks is as strong as it\u2019s ever been. At a time of economic uncertainty but also great political risk, we need the [US] Fed and the Bank of England to play these roles. But the reforms we\u2019ve seen over the last few years have hugely concentrated power in central banks. I think it\u2019s unfinished business.\u201d Students of politics may note that the Bank is rather late with its celebrations. Brown granted independence on 7 May, less than a week after the election. But still, any excuse for a party, I guess. The full agenda is online here.

Unemployment was high and growth volatile.</p> \n   <p>The inflation target rose from the ashes of the ERM debacle twenty five years ago this month, marking the point when price stability became the unambiguous objective of UK monetary policy.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>This culminated in the \u201cthe ashes of the ERM debacle twenty five years ago\u201d, when Britain gave up trying to peg sterling to the Deutschmark.</p> \n  <p>That\u2019s when the UK became unambiguously aiming for price stability, but even that wasn\u2019t a full success.</p> \n  <p>It simply wasn\u2019t fully credible as the chancellor, Ken Clarke, was setting rates.</p> \n  <p>The danger is that politicians promise low inflation, then go for faster growth, and end up delivering neither.</p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-59ccad37e4b050237a54fb7c\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-09-28T08:34:26.367Z\">9.34am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">BoE conference gets underway</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>And we\u2019re off!

    "webTitle": "Brompton recalls nearly 150,000 folding bicycles over axle fault", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The British manufacturer Brompton has embarked on an unprecedented recall of nearly 150,000 of its folding bikes over concerns about faulty axles. The London-based company said 144,000 bikes made between April 2014 and May 2017 were affected by the voluntary recall. The company said the German part had failed on one in 5,000 bikes, which would leave the rider unable to pedal, and that in one case a cyclist had been hurt. The company is asking owners to take their bikes to a certified Brompton dealer where the bracket will be replaced free of charge. Will Butler-Adams, Brompton\u2019s chief executive, said the manufacturer was potentially \u201cgoing overboard\u201d with the recall but wanted to protect its reputation for high quality engineering. Its folding bikes start at about \u00a3900. \u201cWe have had an increased number of failures,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not particularly high but sufficient to give concern. We have had a small number on cases where the metal has cracked and broken.\u201d Although the part, officially described as a bottom bracket cartridge, complies with international safety standards, the company\u2019s criteria are stricter. \u201cThis is a hassle, a pain [for riders], and we are really sorry about that and potentially we\u2019re going overboard but it is critical to us to protect the experience of our customers,\u201d said Butler-Adams in a video posted on the company\u2019s website. \u201cWe are founded on quality \u2026 founded on really good quality engineering. So if we have the slightest concern we have to act.\u201d The company is named after the Brompton Oratory in South Kensington, which the company\u2019s founder, Andrew Ritchie, could see from the window of his flat as he worked on a prototype in the early 1980s. Ritchie is still the company\u2019s biggest shareholder but no longer sits on the board. In 2015 the company sold a 5% stake to the Pizza Express entrepreneur Luke Johnson. The recall comes at a critical time for the high-end manufacturer, which is gearing up for the launch of an electric model.

      "bodyText": "Lloyd\u2019s of London, the world\u2019s biggest insurance market, has started paying out the first of $4.5bn (\u00a33.6bn) of claims related to tropical storm Harvey and Hurricane Irma, which wreaked havoc in the southern US and Caribbean. Inga Beale, the Lloyd\u2019s of London chief executive, said: \u201cThe market is assessing claims and starting to make payments that will help local communities and businesses get back on their feet as quickly as possible.\u201d Catastrophe modelling companies have estimated the insured damage caused by Harvey and Irma at $50bn to $70bn (\u00a337bn-\u00a352bn). Hurricane Maria, which recently ripped through Puerto Rico, is estimated to have caused $40bn-$85bn in insured losses. Beale said Lloyd\u2019s was using those estimates to work out its share of the losses, about $4.5bn for Harvey and Irma. The market is still working out its liability for Hurricane Maria, the earthquake in Mexico and typhoons in Asia. Analysts at Jefferies estimate a further $1bn hit for Maria and the Mexican earthquake. They expect that Lloyd\u2019s has the capital to absorb these losses without drawing on its central reserves. The cost of property insurance cover in the US is likely to rise \u201cmaterially\u201d as a result, but Asian prices should be unaffected. \u201cIt is clear that 2017 is a major catastrophe year,\u201d said Simon Kilgour, an insurance partner at the law firm CMS. \u201cThe current-year losses are expected to wipe out industry earnings and impact capital for the first time since 2005.\u201d Lloyd\u2019s is closely monitoring the impact of climate change. Beale said rising sea levels raised the losses caused by Hurricane Sandy in 2012 by 30%. Another big challenge is Brexit. As part of its planning, Lloyd\u2019s is about to file an application with the Belgian authorities to set up a subsidiary in Brussels. Beale said this was \u201ca bit more complex\u201d for a market with 83 syndicates than it would be for an individual company, but she still expects the new subsidiary to be up and running by the middle of 2018. Beale welcomed Theresa May\u2019s plan for a two-year transition period. \u201cThe transition would be very helpful for the financial services sector,\u201d she said. While the Brussels subsidiary will ensure that Lloyd\u2019s can write new business in EU countries after the UK leaves, Beale stressed that it was vital for insurers to be able to fulfil their liabilities for existing policies, adding that the outlook was \u201cstill very uncertain\u201d. Lloyd\u2019s has thrown its weight behind proposals for a free trade agreement for financial services that would ensure UK and EU companies can trade in each other\u2019s countries without tariffs or quotas. Beale\u2019s comments came as Lloyd\u2019s reported a pretax profit of \u00a31.2bn for the first half of this year, down from \u00a31.46bn a year ago. It excludes the impact of the storms and other recent natural disasters.",

    "webTitle": "Ryanair may face legal action over flight cancellations", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The Civil Aviation Authority has launched enforcement action against Ryanair for \u201cpersistently misleading passengers\u201d about their rights, piling more woe on the airline as it announced a second wave of flight cancellations affecting 400,000 people. In a letter to the Dublin-based carrier, the CAA said Ryanair\u2019s chief executive, Michael O\u2019Leary, was wrong to tell passengers last week that it did not have to arrange new flights for them, after an initial batch of cancellations was announced. The airline regulator said Ryanair had further transgressed when it notified people of fresh disruption on Wednesday, by failing to tell passengers they could be rerouted with other airlines if there were no suitable alternative on one of its planes. It added that Ryanair should correct any misleading statements and invited the airline to discuss the matter, warning that legal action could follow if the carrier is found to be in breach of consumer protection laws. The CAA chief executive, Andrew Haines, said: \u201cThere are clear laws in place, which are intended to assist passengers in the event of a cancellation ... We have made this crystal clear to Ryanair, who are well aware of their legal obligations.\u201d Ryanair said on Thursday: \u201cWe will be meeting with the CAA and will comply fully with whatever requirements they ask us to.\u201d The regulator issued the warning as the airline said it would scrap 18,000 flights on 34 routes between November and March, and said it has emailed affected customers to offer a refund or an alternative flight. Passengers will also receive a travel voucher for a \u00a340 one-way or \u00a380 return journey that can be used to book a Ryanair flight for travel between October 2017 and March 2018. Affected routes include London Stansted to Edinburgh and Glasgow, Gatwick to Belfast, Newcastle to Faro, and Glasgow to Las Palmas. News of the cancellations came a week after Ryanair announced plans to scrap up to 50 flights a day until 31 October, citing a \u201cmess-up\u201d in how it schedules time off for pilots, affecting 315,000 customers. At the time, Ryanair dismissed a Guardian report that the disruption may not be over, saying: \u201cThere will be no further cancellations as a result of this rostering failure.\u201d Announcing the latest cancellations, O\u2019Leary apologised to customers for a second time, but defended the changes. \u201cWe sincerely apologise to those customers who have been affected by last week\u2019s flight cancellations, or these sensible schedule changes announced today,\u201d he said. \u201cFrom today, there will be no more rostering-related flight cancellations this winter or in summer 2018. Slower growth this winter will create lots of spare aircraft and crews, which will allow us to manage the exceptional volumes of annual leave we committed to delivering in the nine months to December 2017. \u201cWe will start a new 12-month leave period on 1 January 2018 in full compliance with EU regulations and the IAA\u2019s [Irish Aviation Authority] requirements.\u201d The airline said cancelling thousands of flights over winter would eliminate all risk of further flight cancellations. But former and current Ryanair pilots, among them several who warned last week of further cancellations, said anger about working conditions could lead to more problems. \u201cIt all depends if we manage to unionise,\u201d said one current Ryanair pilot. He added that he and colleagues may \u201cwork to rule\u201d, meaning they would stop doing things they are not obliged to contractually that help the airline manage its tight schedule. This includes turning up for work early to ensure punctuality and fielding telephone calls from the company during days off. \u201cThat would cause significant delays and some cancellations,\u201d he said. \u201cStriking is only a last resort, as we don\u2019t want to harm the passengers. We only want Ryanair to reason with us and give similar contracts compared with other airlines, easyJet for example, so ultimately it\u2019s up to Ryanair, and I\u2019m sure they will not listen until we take collective action.\u201d One former pilot, who is in touch with their ex-colleagues, said: \u201cThey cannot rule it [fresh cancellations] out.\u201d Both spoke on condition of anonymity in case their job prospects were affected. Ryanair estimated that the total cost of its cancellations would be less than \u20ac50m (\u00a344m), but said this would not change its prediction of annual net profit of between \u20ac1.4bn and \u20ac1.45bn. But the airline admitted that the cancellations would slow its rapid growth, with 6 million fewer passengers due to fly with the airline by 2019 than otherwise would have done. It will also reduce fares in an effort to prevent further damage to its reputation. The blunder has also forced Ryanair to pull out of its plans to bid for Alitalia, Italy\u2019s bankrupt flag carrier. The Irish airline said it wanted to \u201celiminate all management distractions\u201d. Hannah Maundrell, the editor-in-chief of money.co.uk, said the latest flight cancellations were frustrating for customers. \u201cIt\u2019s so disappointing for Ryanair passengers whose flights have been cancelled; even with more notice this time, it\u2019s still seriously frustrating,\u201d she said. Twitter users reported problems rebooking and speaking to customer service representatives on Ryanair\u2019s website as they tried to rescue holiday plans and make alternative arrangements for business trips. Ryanair dismissed suggestions that its scheduling problems have been exacerbated by an overall shortage of pilots, insisting it has recruited 186 since the problem began and has a long waiting list of applicants. But the airline declined to say how many of the pilots on its waiting list have the number of flying hours required to be a captain. A former Ryanair pilot said: \u201cThere will be a large waiting list at what I call cadet level. The problem is that when experienced people leave, you can\u2019t replace them with inexperienced people. You can\u2019t replace a captain with one of those cadets. \u201cThe flying Ryanair does can be more challenging than long-haul. It\u2019s a different challenge. You\u2019re operating at small airports with very little air traffic control and different procedures. You need experience.\u201d Ryanair also said reports from the Irish Air Line Pilots\u2019 Association that more than 700 of its pilots have quit in the past year were exaggerated, insisting only 260 have left. Many of Ryanair\u2019s 4,200 pilots fly for the airline on a temporary contract basis, rather than as full employees, a situation that has been a bone of contention for some. In letters that have been circulated among Ryanair pilots at dozens of bases across Europe, some have demanded that the airline ditch the contract model in favour of local employment contracts. Pilots and cabin crew have been turning to trade unions for advice and in some cases applying for membership in an attempt to secure improved conditions. But Ryanair said it would not meet unions and would only meet \u201cdirectly\u201d with its \u201cpeople\u201d.",

We have made this crystal clear to Ryanair, who are well aware of their legal obligations.\u201d</p> <p>Ryanair said on Thursday: \u201cWe will be meeting with the CAA and will comply fully with whatever requirements they ask us to.\u201d</p> <p>The regulator issued the warning as the airline said it would scrap 18,000 flights on 34 routes between November and March, and said it has emailed affected customers to offer a refund or an alternative flight.<br></p> <p>Passengers will also receive a travel voucher for a \u00a340 one-way or \u00a380 return journey that can be used to book a Ryanair flight for travel between October 2017 and March 2018. Affected routes include London Stansted to Edinburgh and Glasgow, Gatwick to Belfast, Newcastle to Faro, and Glasgow to Las Palmas.</p> <p>News of the cancellations came a week after Ryanair announced plans to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/sep/18/ryanair-cancelled-flights-compensation\">scrap up to 50 flights a day</a> until 31 October, citing a \u201cmess-up\u201d in how it schedules time off for pilots, affecting 315,000 customers. At the time, Ryanair dismissed a Guardian report that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/sep/20/more-ryanair-cancellations-likely-as-pilots-reject-offer-to-work-on-days-off\">the disruption may not be over</a>, saying: \u201cThere will be no further cancellations as a result of this rostering failure.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/tools/tables/embed/index.html?spreadsheet=1shWTXwBDbBorq-KGDoiyToaqKsgCkvuh7BYk_fSYqfw\" data-alt=\"List of the 34 routes suspended by Ryainair\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/tools/tables/embed/index.html?spreadsheet=1shWTXwBDbBorq-KGDoiyToaqKsgCkvuh7BYk_fSYqfw\">List of the 34 routes suspended by Ryainair</a> <figcaption>List of the 34 routes suspended by Ryainair</figcaption> </figure>  <p>Announcing the latest cancellations, O\u2019Leary apologised to customers for a second time, but defended the changes. \u201cWe sincerely apologise to those customers who have been affected by last week\u2019s flight cancellations, or these sensible schedule changes announced today,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cFrom today, there will be no more rostering-related flight cancellations this winter or in summer 2018. Slower growth this winter will create lots of spare aircraft and crews, which will allow us to manage the exceptional volumes of annual leave we committed to delivering in the nine months to December 2017.</p> <p>\u201cWe will start a new 12-month leave period on 1 January 2018 in full compliance with EU regulations and the IAA\u2019s [Irish Aviation Authority] requirements.\u201d</p> <p>The airline said cancelling thousands of flights over winter would eliminate all risk of further flight cancellations. </p> <p>But former and current Ryanair pilots, among them several who warned last week of further cancellations, said anger about working conditions <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/sep/23/ryanair-losing-height-cancellations-staffing-crises\">could lead to more problems</a>.</p> <p>\u201cIt all depends if we manage to unionise,\u201d said one current Ryanair pilot. He added that he and colleagues may \u201cwork to rule\u201d, meaning they would stop doing things they are not obliged to contractually that help the airline manage its tight schedule.</p> <p>This includes turning up for work early to ensure punctuality and fielding telephone calls from the company during days off.</p> <p>\u201cThat would cause significant delays and some cancellations,\u201d he said. \u201cStriking is only a last resort, as we don\u2019t want to harm the passengers. We only want Ryanair to reason with us and give similar contracts compared with other airlines, easyJet for example, so ultimately it\u2019s up to Ryanair, and I\u2019m sure they will not listen until we take collective action.\u201d</p> <p>One former pilot, who is in touch with their ex-colleagues, said: \u201cThey cannot rule it [fresh cancellations] out.\u201d Both spoke on condition of anonymity in case their job prospects were affected.</p> <p>Ryanair estimated that the total cost of its cancellations would be less than \u20ac50m (\u00a344m), but said this would not change its prediction of annual net profit of between \u20ac1.4bn and \u20ac1.45bn.<br></p> <p>But the airline admitted that the cancellations would slow its rapid growth, with 6 million fewer passengers due to fly with the airline by 2019 than otherwise would have done. It will also reduce fares in an effort to prevent further damage to its reputation.</p> <p>The blunder has also forced Ryanair to pull out of its <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/sep/14/ryanair-preparing-takeover-bid-alitalia-michael-oleary\">plans to bid for Alitalia</a>, Italy\u2019s bankrupt flag carrier. The Irish airline said it wanted to \u201celiminate all management distractions\u201d.</p> <p>Hannah Maundrell, the editor-in-chief of money.co.uk, said the latest flight cancellations were frustrating for customers. \u201cIt\u2019s so disappointing for Ryanair passengers whose flights have been cancelled; even with more notice this time, it\u2019s still seriously frustrating,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Twitter users reported problems rebooking and speaking to customer service representatives on Ryanair\u2019s website as they tried to rescue holiday plans and make alternative arrangements for business trips.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/swartchris8/status/913015474241380353\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Ryanair?src=hash\">#Ryanair</a> is a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/failure?src=hash\">#failure</a> drops my flight, website doesn&#39;t work for rebooking, nor chat, nor phone support. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/EpicFail?src=hash\">#EpicFail</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/CustomerExperience?src=hash\">#CustomerExperience</a></p>&mdash; Chris Swart (@swartchris8) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/swartchris8/status/913015474241380353\">September 27, 2017</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/threadm/status/913059801520799746\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/Ryanair\">@Ryanair</a> good luck rebooking.

But the airline declined to say how many of the pilots on its waiting list have the number of flying hours required to be a captain.</p> <p>A former Ryanair pilot said: \u201cThere will be a large waiting list at what I call cadet level. The problem is that when experienced people leave, you can\u2019t replace them with inexperienced people. You can\u2019t replace a captain with one of those cadets.</p> <p>\u201cThe flying Ryanair does can be more challenging than long-haul. It\u2019s a different challenge. You\u2019re operating at small airports with very little air traffic control and different procedures. You need experience.\u201d</p> <p>Ryanair also said reports from the Irish Air Line Pilots\u2019 Association that more than 700 of its pilots have quit in the past year were exaggerated, insisting only 260 have left.<br></p> <p>Many of Ryanair\u2019s 4,200 pilots fly for the airline on a temporary contract basis, rather than as full employees, a situation that has been a bone of contention for some. In letters that have been circulated among Ryanair pilots at dozens of bases across Europe, some have demanded that the airline ditch the contract model <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/sep/22/ryanair-pilots-michael-oleary-cancellations\">in favour of local employment contracts</a>.</p> <p>Pilots and cabin crew have been turning to trade unions for advice and in some cases applying for membership in an attempt to secure improved conditions. </p> <p>But Ryanair said it would not meet unions and would only meet \u201cdirectly\u201d with its \u201cpeople\u201d.</p>",

In a chapter released ahead of the publication of next month\u2019s World Economic Outlook, the Washington-based IMF said low-income countries had contributed little to the increase in greenhouse gas concentrations and could not afford to tackle the problem from their own meagre resources. \u201cRising temperatures would have vastly unequal effects across the world, with the brunt of adverse consequences borne by those who can least afford it,\u201d the IMF said. \u201cThe international community will have a key role to play in fostering and coordinating financial and other types of support for affected low-income countries. With advanced and emerging market economies contributing the lion\u2019s share to the warming that has occurred so far and is projected to continue, helping low-income countries cope with its consequences is a humanitarian imperative and sound global economic policy.\u201d Using conservative assumptions, the IMF said that by 2100 income per head in a typical low-income country would be 9% lower than it would be in the absence of temperature increases. It added that the present value of these losses would amount to the loss of an entire year of current economic output for a poor nation. The adverse impact of climate change would be long-lasting and would be felt through lower agricultural output, reduced productivity in sectors exposed to the weather, weaker investment and poor health. Higher temperatures constrained growth in the hot regions of emerging and developing economies significantly more than in hot regions of rich nations, underlying the importance of development in reducing vulnerability, the IMF said. The chapter noted that low-income countries had \u201chuge spending needs and scarce resources to undertake the investments necessary to cope with climate change.\u201d The United Nations has agreed a set of sustainable development goals to be met by 2030, but achieving them would require poor countries to increase public spending by up to 30% of gross domestic product. This would not be possible for most countries, the IMF said. \u201cMoreover, domestic policies alone cannot fully insulate low-income countries from the consequences of climate change as higher temperatures push the biophysical limits of these countries\u2019 ecosystems, potentially triggering more frequent epidemics, famines, and other natural disasters, at the same time fuelling migration pressure and conflict risk,\u201d the chapter said. It warned that \u201csubstantial migration flows, potentially spilling across country borders, could arise if climate change leads to a significant rise in sea levels.\u201d On current global warming projections, hundreds of millions of people in low-lying areas could become vulnerable to flooding, forcing them to abandon their homes. The international spillovers from the most vulnerable countries, through depressed economic activity and potentially higher conflict and migration flows, could be considerable, the IMF said. \u201cGoing forward, only a global effort to contain carbon emissions to levels consistent with an acceptable increase in temperature can limit the long-term risk of climate change.\u201d",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "More than 1 million people entered the global ranks of the wealthy last year as booming stock markets increased the number of individuals with free assets of more than $1m (\u00a3750,000) to a record 16.5 million. Research by the business consultancy Capgemini found that the world\u2019s high net worth individuals (HNWI) collectively hold a $63.5tn fortune. In order to qualify as an HNWI, a person\u2019s assets \u2013 excluding their primary residence and its contents \u2013 must be worth at least $1m. More than 1.1 million people saw their cash fortunes tip them into the HNWI bracket over 2016 as investments in shares in US and European markets performed well. The ranks of HNWIs grew by 8.2% in 2016, up from 6.5% annualised growth over the previous five years. Cliff Evans, one of Capgemini\u2019s researchers, said the report showed that the already-rich were getting richer at a much faster rate than the wider population. \u201cFor people with a lot of money the service they\u2019re getting from investment managers is proving its worth,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you can afford the advice you get a much greater return.\u201d The report found that HNWIs earned average returns of 24.3% on their portfolios that were overseen by a wealth manager in 2016. This compares with average interest rates of just 0.35% offered by instant-access high street bank accounts, according to the Bank of England. It comes as a growing number of politicians, economists and even the super-wealthy themselves are speaking out about the dangers of growing inequality across the world. Four International Monetary Fund (IMF) economists warned that inequality \u201ccan fray social cohesion and undermine the sustainability of growth itself\u201d. \u201cInequality has risen in several advanced economies and remains stubbornly high in many that are still developing,\u201d they said. \u201cThis worries policymakers everywhere for good reason. Research at the IMF and elsewhere makes it clear that persistent lack of inclusion \u2013 defined as broadly shared benefits and opportunities for economic growth \u2013 can fray social cohesion and undermine the sustainability of growth itself.\u201d Ray Dalio, the multibillionaire founder of the world\u2019s biggest hedge fund, Bridgewater Associates, said this week that inequality was the globe\u2019s biggest problem. \u201cI think the greatest issue of our time is the disparity of wealth and the problems that exist for the lower 40% of the population,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you carve out that lower 40%, not only has there been no income growth, but death rates are rising because of opiate use, suicide, and because they\u2019re losing jobs. \u201cThis is the biggest issue of our time \u2013 the biggest economic issue, the biggest political issue, and the biggest social issue.\u201d The Capgemini report said there are now 14.9 million \u201cmillionaires next door\u201d \u2013 Capgemini\u2019s term for those with investable assets of between $1m and $5m. This group grew by 7.4% in 2016. The rate at which rich people tipped over the threshold to become ultra high net worth individuals \u2013 people with investable assets of more than $30m \u2013 grew at 8.3%. This was more than double the increase in 2015 and there are now 157,200 people in the ultra-HNWI bracket, according to the survey. These people collectively hold $22tn of assets \u2013 almost 10 times the UK\u2019s gross domestic product. \u201cUltra-HNWIs, with $30m or more in investable assets, posted striking improvements in wealth and population, thanks in part to an upswing in Latin American economic performance,\u201d the report said. \u201cBecause Latin America accounts for more ultra-HNWI wealth than any other region, it holds significant sway over the segment\u2019s overall growth.\u201d Vibrant growth in Latin America helped lift global ultra-HNWI wealth by 9.2%, up from an increase of 2.5% in 2015. The UK dropped out of the world\u2019s top five countries that HNWIs call home, with France pushing Britain into sixth place. The UK fell down due to the drop in the value of sterling after Brexit, and France\u2019s tally was boosted by from share price growth. There were 568,000 HNWIs in the UK, up slightly 553,000 in 2015. In France the number grew from 523,000 to 579,000.

In order to qualify as an HNWI, a person\u2019s assets \u2013 excluding their primary residence and its contents \u2013 must be worth at least $1m. </p> <p>More than 1.1 million people saw their cash fortunes tip them into the HNWI bracket over 2016 as investments in shares in US and European markets performed well. The ranks of HNWIs grew by 8.2% in 2016, up from 6.5% annualised growth over the previous five years. </p> <p>Cliff Evans, one of Capgemini\u2019s researchers, said the report showed that the already-rich were getting richer at a much faster rate than the wider population. \u201cFor people with a lot of money the service they\u2019re getting from investment managers is proving its worth,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you can afford the advice you get a much greater return.\u201d </p> <p>The report found that HNWIs earned average returns of 24.3% on their portfolios that were overseen by a wealth manager in 2016.
