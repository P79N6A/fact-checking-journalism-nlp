    "webTitle": "Britain's last miners face up to an uncertain future", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "There is a vertical drop, at 25mph, down a shaft more than twice the height of the Eiffel Tower, and then a 2.5km ride on a narrow-gauge train 741 metres underground. Then passengers disembark, clamber along a 300m drift \u2013 which drops a further 80m \u2013 and walk over shattered rock and disused railway sleepers for 3km, before lying face down on an 800m conveyor belt that eventually deposits them at the coalface. This is commuting to work South Yorkshire-style, at least for the 420 men who work at Hatfield Colliery, an employee-owned mine in Ed Miliband's Doncaster North constituency which played a starring role in the 1996 film Brassed Off. The scene underground has changed little since the troubled 1990s portrayed in the movie, or the even more bitter 1984 miners' strike, which started 30 years ago. Bags of finely grated non-flammable limestone are suspended from cotton bags attached to the ceilings (they should burst following an explosion). The men's belts house their emergency breathing apparatus \u2013 technology developed for tank drivers during the first world war, but made available to the miners in the 1960s. Tunnels that were more than three metres high when dug in 2006 have succumbed to pressure and are now low enough for most of the men to be forced into crouching positions as they scuttle to work \u2013 despite nine-metre bolts drilled into the ceilings and sidewalls. Down there, it seems reasonable to view the encroaching surroundings as some sort of symbol: what remains of Britain's coal mining industry is again being squeezed from all sides. Gary Craven, a 48-year-old production manager at Hatfield, is the fifth generation of his family to work in the pits after beginning as an apprentice in Barnsley in 1982. Then, he mined the Barnsley seam \u2013 the same one now being attacked 20 miles away in Hatfield, such is the size of the asset and the distances covered underground. \"When I started there were 170 pits and it was a job for life,\" Craven recalls. \"There are now three. Don't let the three go. Hatfield employs a lot of local people who rely on the mine. There are a lot of reserves. There is no reason why there won't be more than enough reserves to see me to retirement.\" But there is a reason outside Craven's control, which is now uniting the old 1984 rivals from Yorkshire and Nottinghamshire. The three remaining British pits \u2013 Hatfield, Kellingley in North Yorkshire and Nottinghamshire's Thoresby \u2013 are now fighting the green lobby and the Treasury. Coal is undeniably a dirty fuel. It emits twice as much carbon as gas when burned at power stations, which is why coal is being clobbered by an extra environmental tax \u2013 the carbon price floor (CPF) \u2013 which is exclusive to the UK and operates as a top-up to the carbon price of the EU emissions trading scheme. It is particularly swingeing for coal. The industry's trade body, Coalpro, has been desperately lobbying the Treasury and MPs to freeze the charge in this month's budget, arguing that under current CPF plans coal becomes economically unviable, triggering a complete eradication of coal-fired electricity production in the UK by the mid to late 2020s. The group hints that the UK might then have to worry about the lights going out, as coal currently accounts for 40% of UK electricity generation. The alternative, it argues, is importing more gas from overseas. Ian Parkin, group development director for coal supplier Hargreaves Services, says: \"People in the industry just don't see the logic in taxing us out of the market and then importing gas from Europe.\" The coal lobby would say that, of course, but even those on the green side of the argument appear reluctant to support the CPF, which is widely thought to be having little effect on total carbon emissions as it simply shifts energy-intensive production to other countries where the charge doesn't exist. However, some certainly see the potential demise of the remnants of the UK coal industry as a goal worth pursuing. Caroline Lucas, the Green MP for Brighton Pavilion, says: \"Under current government policy there is a huge risk of investment in gas generation at the expense of low-carbon technologies, which would bulldoze the UK's climate objectives and lock us into dependence on high-carbon, high-cost fossil fuels. But keeping coal plants open instead is not a solution. Instead, the government should be putting its efforts into securing a massive increase in renewables and energy efficiency.\" Will Straw, an associate director for climate change at the thinktank IPPR, adds: \"The way to address the potential supply issues in the future is to increase the amount of renewables and nuclear, expand the use of gas power stations in the medium term, increase energy efficiency and have bigger interconnection to Europe.\" But he admits that Whitehall must put a \"rocket booster behind all those policies\" to fill the 40% gap left by the end of coal. \"If we don't find a solution for carbon capture and storage then the planet burns,\" he adds. \"There is simply too much fossil fuel in the world. But it is much better to use gas rather than coal while we wait for viable CCS, as gas is less polluting.\" Those opposed to coal talk about policies to support regenerating communities such as Hatfield if the mines shut. But the miners are unlikely to thank them for that: many still talk about their trade in almost romantic tones. Long memories also mean they are unlikely to forget those who lined up against them. On the underground railway one \u2013 possibly apocryphal \u2013 tale about a strike-breaker gets a rerun. In 2004, after years in the cold, the ostracised miner applied to be readmitted into the miners' club to celebrate his birthday. He was refused. Surely old animosities should be forgotten after 20 years, protested one colleague. \"Twenty years?\" scoffed the club chairman. \"He broke the 1926 strike. This is his 100th birthday.\"",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Premier Foods, maker of Ambrosia custard, Mr Kipling cakes and Oxo stock cubes, has said it will not fully repair a the \u00a31bn deficit in its pension scheme for 18 years, despite raising \u00a3353m from shareholders in a deeply discounted rights issue. Fresh funds from shareholders will instead contribute to paying down the ailing group's bank loans, some of which are thought to have been acquired by distressed debt investors. Also going to repay bank loans will be proceeds from a \u00a3475m new bond issue. Total existing debt to be repaid is \u00a3886m. The radical restructuring, which includes a new \u00a3300m revolving debt facility, follows two years of rapid asset disposals which have seen Premier jettison Hartley's jam, Sun-Pat peanut butter and Branston pickle. Sell-off proceeds of \u00a3370m went to pay down bank debt, while not a penny went to the pension scheme. Premier has also agreed to sell a majority stake in the struggling Hovis bread business to a US investment firm, as part of efforts to repair its balance sheet. Premier's pension scheme, the largest outside the FTSE 100, has 60,000 members. In recent years trustees have twice already handed major concessions to Premier management in the hope of setting the business on the path back to a sustainable financial model. Pension scheme payment holidays and deferrals, combined with a mounting deficit, have seen Premier's obligations piling up. Yesterday the company confirmed its 2013 pension deficit \u2013 calculated every three years \u2013 had reached \u00a31.06bn. The latest refinancing deal, however, will see Premier's pension repair schedule \u2014 agreed only two years ago \u2013 torn up and replaced with a new plan that will reduce and spread out deficit contributions over 18 years. This is well over the 10-year repair plan limit the Pensions Regulator typically presses companies to agree to, and is longer than the then-controversial 17-year programme agreed by BT in 2010. It is understood the complex restructuring deal, which must win the approval of shareholders at a meeting on 20 March, has yet to be approved by the Pensions Regulator. The regulator is responsible for monitoring deals that require concessions from pension trustees. The Pensions Regulator is responsible for looking out for the interests of the Pension Protection Fund, the official lifeboat scheme which takes over the liabilities of pension schemes in the event of a company collapse. Independent pensions expert John Ralfe has repeatedly expressed concern that pensions regulators are allowing Premier to be stripped of assets, with proceeds going solely to its banks. The resulting diminished business is left with outsized pension obligations which are no longer appropriate. \"This is a defining moment for the Pensions Regulator. If it does approve this further concession, surely it shows it has no real powers to protect UK pension schemes.\" Nevertheless, with shareholders prepared to put fresh capital into the business, the Pension Regulator is expected to be under intense pressure to wave the latest deal through. According to Ralfe: \"If the fund raising cannot be completed, this would have serious consequences for the company's future.\" In return for concessions, Premier pension schemes are expected to receive some security, the details of which are unclear. Chief executive Gavin Darby, a former Vodafone and Coca-Cola executive who joined a year ago, said the plan was \"transformational\" for the group. \"This new capital structure will liberate Premier Foods from its past. Following the announcement to simplify the group through the Hovis joint venture, we are now focused on growing a high quality branded grocery business.\" \u2022 This article was amended on Wednesday 5 March 2014 to make clear Premier has agreed to sell its majority stake in Hovis.",

Yesterday the company confirmed its 2013 pension deficit \u2013 calculated every three years \u2013 had reached \u00a31.06bn. The latest refinancing deal, however, will see Premier's pension repair schedule \u2014 agreed only two years ago \u2013 torn up and replaced with a new plan that will reduce and spread out deficit contributions over 18 years.</p> <p>This is well over the 10-year repair plan limit the Pensions Regulator typically presses companies to agree to, and is longer than the then-controversial 17-year programme agreed by BT in 2010.</p> <p>It is understood the complex restructuring deal, which must win the approval of shareholders at a meeting on 20 March, has yet to be approved by the Pensions Regulator. The regulator is responsible for monitoring deals that require concessions from pension trustees.</p> <p>The Pensions Regulator is responsible for looking out for the interests of the Pension Protection Fund, the official lifeboat scheme which takes over the liabilities of pension schemes in the event of a company collapse.</p> <p>Independent pensions expert John Ralfe has repeatedly expressed concern that pensions regulators are allowing Premier to be stripped of assets, with proceeds going solely to its banks. The resulting diminished business is left with outsized pension obligations which are no longer appropriate. \"This is a defining moment for the Pensions Regulator. If it does approve this further concession, surely it shows it has no real powers to protect UK pension schemes.\"</p> <p>Nevertheless, with shareholders prepared to put fresh capital into the business, the Pension Regulator is expected to be under intense pressure to wave the latest deal through. According to Ralfe: \"If the fund raising cannot be completed, this would have serious consequences for the company's future.\"</p> <p>In return for concessions, Premier pension schemes are expected to receive some security, the details of which are unclear.</p> <p>Chief executive Gavin Darby, a former Vodafone and Coca-Cola executive who joined a year ago, said the plan was \"transformational\" for the group. \"This new capital structure will liberate Premier Foods from its past. Following the announcement to simplify the group through the Hovis joint venture, we are now focused on growing a high quality branded grocery business.\"</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on Wednesday 5 March 2014 to make clear Premier has agreed to sell its majority stake in Hovis.</p>",

      "bodyText": "One of the architects of the EU's cap on bankers' bonuses has called for the UK government to be sued for allowing banks to sidestep the new rules as two more high street banks were preparing to hand their bosses up to \u00a31m in extra pay to avoid the clampdown. Philippe Lamberts, the Belgian Green MEP who helped devise the restrictions, said it was clear the UK was failing to implement EU law and accused the coalition of having no interest in halting \"absurd remuneration packages\". He urged the European commission to take the UK to court for allowing bankers to bend the rules which limit bonuses to 100% of salary or 200% if shareholders approve. His plea came as Barclays and the bailed-out Lloyds Banking Group are expected to reveal they are handing their bosses Antony Jenkins and Ant\u00f3nio Horta-Os\u00f3rio new share awards, on top of their salaries, to prevent their overall pay falling as a result of the cap. The new pay deals could be announced as early as Wednesday. Their disclosures will follow HSBC's move to pay its chief executive, Stuart Gulliver, an additional \u00a332,000 a week in allowances on top of his \u00a31.2m salary, and after Virgin Money raised the salary of its boss, Jayne-Anne Gadhia, to \u00a3637,000 from \u00a3550,000 as a result of the restriction. Royal Bank of Scotland, which is 81% owned by the taxpayer and paid out \u00a3567m in bonuses after making an \u00a38bn loss, is yet to announce its response to the bonus cap. However, it is considering asking its shareholders for permission to pay out bonuses worth 200% of salary. Standard Chartered reports its results on Wednesday when it will also face questions about how it intends to tackle the cap. \"What we are witnessing now is an attempt by the major banks, with the support of the British government, to circumvent the rules and that is to compensate what we did on terms of structure, by just raising the fixed rate of remuneration,\" said Lamberts. The European commissioner for the single market, Michel Barnier, should take legal action against the UK, he said. \"I will see Barnier soon and I will encourage him to do that. I know that the commission has already asked for specific information from the British government. So I will certainly take a hard look at that.\" The chancellor, George Osborne, is challenging the bonus cap in the EU's highest court because it will push up the amount of fixed pay but Lamberts said he was not worried about losing because the UK government argument that the caps are illegal was based on \"fragile\" logic. \"People like David Cameron and George Osborne are part of the same club. These are people who are really out of touch with reality. They are part of the same class, so I think it is natural for them to defend their interests.\" The MEP insisted that the EU cap on bankers' bonuses had not failed, because \"disguised remuneration\" was now out in the open. Barnier on Tuesday published details of which bank staff would be affected by the cap and said that \"some banks are doing their utmost to circumvent remuneration rules\u2026 The commission will remain vigilant to ensure that new rules are applied in full.\" The European commission said it was too early to say if any country was in breach of the capital requirements directive, known as CRD IV, which includes the bonus cap. Lamberts, however, said the UK government was in breach of the directive:\"To me it is clear that it doesn't act. And I think the best example of that is when a bank is 80% owned by the British government and they are not acting. To me they have no appetite for really going after absurd remuneration packages.\" The Bank of England governor, Mark Carney, is also opposed to the restrictions and has written to the Treasury select committee to promise a new consultation this month on tougher measures to claw back bonuses and to extend the deferral period for bonuses from three to five years, in line with recommendations by last year's parliamentary commission on banking standards. Carney warned the select committee - which is overseeing implementation of the commission's recommendations - that its proposal to claw back pension rights from individuals at banks in receipt of taxpayer support could be in breach of European human rights legislation and the UK pensions act. Lloyds has already announced that Horta-Os\u00f3rio is receiving a \u00a31.7m bonus for 2013 and is likely to reveal a payout from a long-term incentive plan of around \u00a32.9m. It may also disclose whether bonuses are being clawed back from previous management for new provisions for PPI mis-selling and last year's \u00a328m fine for bonus structures which encouraged mis-selling.",

Here\u2019s a flavour:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It was designed as a relaxed televised chat with a small group of invited journalists by a relaxed leader in full command of the situation. But it became a rambling, often tetchy performance from Putin, repeatedly scolding journalists for failing to understand him, or for leaving their mobile phones on.</p> <p>But amid the irritability and hectoring, there were some clear messages. First of all, Russian feels bound by no international legal constraints on its actions in Ukraine, least of all the 1994 Budapest Memorandum, by which Russia and western states pledged to respect Ukrainian territorial integrity in return for Kiev\u2019s surrender of its Soviet-era nuclear arsenal. Putin dispensed with that particular piece of paper in a couple of lines.</p> <p>\u201cIf it\u2019s a revolution, what does that mean? It\u2019s hard not to agree that a new government is appearing in this country, just like in Russia after 1917,\u201d Putin said. \u201cWe didn\u2019t sign any documents with this government.\u201d</p> </blockquote> <h2><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/mar/04/putin-ukraine-olive-branches-russian-tanks\">Putin offers Ukraine olive branches delivered by Russian tanks</a></h2> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-53160566e4b093d4729c31fa\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2014-03-04T16:55:08.523Z\">4.55pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/TradeDesk_Steve/statuses/440890354750201856\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>Escalation from Kerry here : - US congratulates Ukranian government on restraint in the face of Russian (cont) <a href=\"http://t.co/Nj6I3MIhaA\">http://t.co/Nj6I3MIhaA</a></p>&mdash;

The volume of transit gas supplies to Europe across Ukraine increased in 2013 to a total of over 86 billion cubic metres.</p> <p>We\u2019ve been consistently increasing our supplies using other routes, such as the Nord Stream gas pipeline, which is used to deliver 100 million cubic metres of gas daily from Russia directly to Germany and other EU countries.</p> <p>Work on the South Stream project, which is one of Gazprom\u2019s priority investment projects, is on schedule. We\u2019ve begun the construction of onshore sections of the pipeline in Bulgaria and Serbia. Gas supplies to Europe using the South Stream will begin in late December 2015. This will give us an additional gas exports route.</p> <p>Currently, Gazprom is finalising talks with our Chinese partners, and we are almost ready to sign a 30-year gas supply contract with China.</p> </blockquote> <p>There has been talk of a deal with China for some time -- <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-01-22/gazprom-says-china-natural-gas-deal-delayed-to-putin-s-may-visit.html\">Bloomberg covered it in January</a>, and there\u2019s a <a href=\"http://qz.com/164163/china-and-russia-seem-genuinely-close-to-a-game-changing-natural-gas-deal/\">great backgrounder on Quartz too</a>.</p> <p><b>The timing is very interesting too, as Channel 4\u2019s Faisal Islam points out:</b></p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/faisalislam/statuses/440868639038656512\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>This is basically a piece of social media diplomacy by the Russian Govt: <a href=\"http://t.co/FY9NnpmKKh\">http://t.co/FY9NnpmKKh</a> dont forget, we have options with our gas.</p>&mdash; Faisal Islam (@faisalislam) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/faisalislam/statuses/440868639038656512\">March 4, 2014</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/faisalislam/statuses/440870795569410048\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>And here is the proposed Gazprom pipeline to China: <a href=\"http://t.co/n7PZ6SBrmR\">http://t.co/n7PZ6SBrmR</a></p>&mdash; Faisal Islam (@faisalislam) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/faisalislam/statuses/440870795569410048\">March 4, 2014</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p><b>It has also emerged today that Miller said Gazprom has decided to cancel Ukraine\u2019s price discounts from April, meaning the company must pay more for its gas from next month</b>.

      "bodyText": "And that\u2019s all for tonight in the City. Keep watching our rolling liveblog for Ukraine developments through the evening. Goodnight. GW The US stock market continues to touch record highs. Over in New York, the S&amp;P 500 is up 1.5%, or 26 points, at 1872, on track for its highest ever close. The Dow Jones has also climbed back, up 217 points or 1.3% in early afternoon trading with every share gaining ground. While oil and gold have fallen, the yields (interest rates) on US and UK government debt has risen as traders move back out of risky assets. The yields on 10-year U.S. Treasuries and German Bunds rose 7 basis points and 4 basis points to 2.67% and 1.60%, respectively. Kim Forrest, senior equity research analyst at Fort Pitt Capital Group in Pittsburgh, reckons the wild swings in the markets are somewhat excessive, as ever: \u201cIn the short term, the market always over-reacts,\u201d \u201cWe got marginally good news today, but we don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen tomorrow.\u201d Anyone returning to the City tomorrow morning after four days of solitude in a cave might not suspect the last few days had been quite so dramatic. The FTSE 100 has raced ahead today to close up 115 points at 6823, a rise of 1.7%. That more than wipes out yesterday\u2019s 101-point tumble. In Germany, the DAX surged by 230 points, or 2.46%, after plunging almost 3.5% on Monday on the prospect of disruption to Germany\u2019s business links with the Russian economy. The Italian FTSE MIB was the outstanding in the EU performer, jumping 3.6%, while France\u2019s CAC gained 2.4% and Spain\u2019s IBEX rose 2.5%. John Kerry\u2019s blunt message to Putin this afternoon to row back from his Crimea adventure came in the final minutes of trading, so couldn\u2019t really be digested. But the general market view is that the situation is less likely to blow up into a full-blown military clash, or to stunt the global economy. Michael Hewson of CMC Markets was reminded of an earlier military escapade:: After this morning\u2019s news that Russian forces had been pulled back from the Eastern Ukrainian border, markets have executed a sharp about turn in the manner of the Grand Old Duke of York as having been marched down the hill yesterday they got marched straight back up again, with the mood given added impetus by a press conference from Russian President Putin, when he stated he wasn\u2019t looking to annex the Crimea and that additional troops would only be sent into Ukraine under extreme circumstances and in observance of international law. There has been speculation that Putin may have blinked in the face of political pressure from the West, but it is more likely, having seen the financial market meltdown that battered Russian assets yesterday, he was persuaded by sources closer to home that it might be wiser to look for an exit strategy, as Russian oligarchs saw the value of the wealth eroded sharply. But with troops still in Crimea, Hewson adds, you\u2019d be foolish to think more twists and turns don\u2019t lie ahead. Chris Beauchamp, Market Analyst at IG, agrees that Putin\u2019s press conference calmed investors worldwide: The strong open was solidified after a press conference from Russia\u2019s president Vladimir Putin, which he conducted in his own unique style, speaking without notes and looking like a man who was in control of events (and knew it). Mr Putin seemed to hint that he was determined to avoid a military confrontation, and his calming words did much to reassure jittery markets. Thankfully for all concerned, the situation seems calmer than it did 24 hours ago. Don\u2019t miss this -- Guardian diplomatic editor Julian Borger has analysed Vladimir Putin\u2019s press conference today. Here\u2019s a flavour: It was designed as a relaxed televised chat with a small group of invited journalists by a relaxed leader in full command of the situation. But it became a rambling, often tetchy performance from Putin, repeatedly scolding journalists for failing to understand him, or for leaving their mobile phones on. But amid the irritability and hectoring, there were some clear messages. First of all, Russian feels bound by no international legal constraints on its actions in Ukraine, least of all the 1994 Budapest Memorandum, by which Russia and western states pledged to respect Ukrainian territorial integrity in return for Kiev\u2019s surrender of its Soviet-era nuclear arsenal. Putin dispensed with that particular piece of paper in a couple of lines. \u201cIf it\u2019s a revolution, what does that mean? It\u2019s hard not to agree that a new government is appearing in this country, just like in Russia after 1917,\u201d Putin said. \u201cWe didn\u2019t sign any documents with this government.\u201d Putin offers Ukraine olive branches delivered by Russian tanks John Kerry also confirmed the US is offering $1bn of loan guarantees to Kiev, as part of an economic package for the country. That should cushion the impact of Gazprom raising energy prices from April (see 3.50pm) More details here: John Kerry arrives in Kiev and reveals economic package for Ukraine The secretary of state also gave a very firm signal to president Putin that the US stands alongside Ukraine on the journey ahead, and urged the Russian leader to withdraw forces from Crimea back to their barracks: More here in our Ukraine liveblog. The US government, and NATO, aren\u2019t dropping their pressure on Russia over the incursion of troops into Crimea over the weekend (and despite encouraging signs today, that hasn\u2019t changed) Secretary of State John Kerry has begun speaking in Kiev, saying that he \u201ccondemns the Russian Federation\u2019s act of aggression,\u201d and is correcting various misapprehensions put forward by Moscow. Our rolling Ukraine liveblog has the details: A few minutes ago, NATO\u2019s Secretary General Anders Fogh Ramussen told a press conference that \u201cDespite repeated calls by the international community, Russia continues to violate Ukraine\u2019s sovereignty\u201d. Tens of billions of dollars have been added to the value of Russia\u2019s biggest companies tonight, but investors are still nursing heavy losses after Monday\u2019s plunge. The main MICEX index surged 5.2% by the close of trading in Moscow, up 67 points at 1,356, after Vladimir Putin said war with Ukraine was only a last resort and ordered troops on military training in Western Russia back to base. Yesterday the MISEX slid by 156 points, which wiped off $58bn. A back-of-the-envelope calculation suggests around $25bn was added back today. With the threat of military action easing, Russia appears to be using gas to pile more pressure on Ukraine, and Europe. The Russian government released a transcript of a conversation between prime minister Dmitry Medvedev and Alexei Miller, CEO of Gazprom. In it, Miller tells the PM that Gazprom is close to signing a 30-year contract with China -- in what looks like a clear hint that it could supply less gas through Ukraine to the west in future. Miller said: We used traditional routes across Ukraine as our main supply routes. The volume of transit gas supplies to Europe across Ukraine increased in 2013 to a total of over 86 billion cubic metres. We\u2019ve been consistently increasing our supplies using other routes, such as the Nord Stream gas pipeline, which is used to deliver 100 million cubic metres of gas daily from Russia directly to Germany and other EU countries. Work on the South Stream project, which is one of Gazprom\u2019s priority investment projects, is on schedule. We\u2019ve begun the construction of onshore sections of the pipeline in Bulgaria and Serbia. Gas supplies to Europe using the South Stream will begin in late December 2015. This will give us an additional gas exports route. Currently, Gazprom is finalising talks with our Chinese partners, and we are almost ready to sign a 30-year gas supply contract with China. There has been talk of a deal with China for some time -- Bloomberg covered it in January, and there\u2019s a great backgrounder on Quartz too. The timing is very interesting too, as Channel 4\u2019s Faisal Islam points out: It has also emerged today that Miller said Gazprom has decided to cancel Ukraine\u2019s price discounts from April, meaning the company must pay more for its gas from next month. He said the decision was taken because Ukraine has failed to meet previous payments and now owes $1.5bn. Curiously, Miller also told reporters that Gazprom could offer Ukraine a loan of $2-3 billion to pay off the debt, according to Reuters. And that\u2019s a fresh 14-year high on the tech-heavy Nasdaq index: POP! The S&amp;P 500 index just hit a new intraday high on Wall Street, climbing above 1,868 points for the first time ever. Further evidence that investors reckon the risk of military action in Ukraine has receded, along with the possibility of tough sanctions being imposed on Russia that might derail the global economic recovery. Shares are rallying in New York as the US stock market opens, and catches up with the latest developments over Ukraine. The Dow Jones industrial average has jumped 185 points in early trading to 16353, a gain of 1.15%. The Nasdaq rose 1.2%. Traders on Wall Street have noted Vladimir Putin\u2019s comments today that war in Ukraine was very unlikely, and concluded that tensions in the region are easing. Doug Cote, chief market strategist at ING US Investment Management in New York, explained: \u201cThis is a done deal; if it was escalating, it would have by now \u201cThe market is back to fundamentals. Earnings have been fabulous for the fourth quarter. This market is going up because fundamentals are positive.\u201d Just stumbled on an interesting blogpost on income inequality, on Columbia Management\u2019s site. It explains how the failure of lower-paid workers\u2019 pay packets to keep pace with the 5% top earners was an important cause of the 2008 financial crisis, as it drove demand for (then-easy) credit. You may have known that already. But this post also flags up another important point - the trend began earlier than many might think,with the wealthiest starting to claim an increasingly large slice of the pie from the mid-1980s onwards. Marie Schofield, chief economist at Columbia, and Toby Nangle, head of multi asset allocation, write: The roots of the great financial crisis and the slow post-recovery period can be traced to many factors, but a predominant one is the rise in income inequality. What is not generally known is that this is not a new or recent development\u2014income inequality for both wages and earnings in the U.S. (and other advanced economies) began to rise starting in the 1980s. The income share of the top 5% in the U.S. income distribution was a fairly constant 20% from 1960 to 1980, with income gains for the top 5% and for the bottom 95% fairly close at near four percent annually. After 1980 the income share of the top 5% rose steadily in the U.S. lifting their income share to 35% by 2012. Here\u2019s their key points: The rise in income inequality was a root cause of the U.S. financial crisis and the slow post-recovery period. Mediocre income gains for middle income households have contributed to the slow recovery of U.S. consumption and economic growth. As pressure continues to build to address income inequality, we expect the government to lead on this issue and private sector to lag. More here: The role of income inequality The US stock market is also tipped to rally around 1% when it opens, in around 20 minutes World stock markets have bounced back after Russia took some steps to calm the crisis sparked by its military action in Ukraine. Shares rallied in Moscow, and on European stock markets across the region -- although the situation remains tense and fluid. Scott Meech, co-head of European equities at Union Bancaire Privee (UBP), says: \u201cIt\u2019s still a very worrying situation but seems to have calmed down a bit. That\u2019s why we\u2019re seeing a bit of a recovery.\u201d The FTSE 100 gained over 100 points at one stage, clawing back all Monday\u2019s losses. And the MICEX index jumped 5%, having tumbled 10% yesterday. Short-term relief gushed through trading floors after the news broke this morning that the Kremlin had told troops on military exercises in Western Russia, near the Ukraine border, to return to their bases. This calmed fears that they could soon be sent into eastern Ukraine. At a press conference, President Putin told reporters that his decision to send troops into Crimea would not provoke war. Putin also said that former Ukranian president Yanukovych had no political future, and claimed that events in Kiev are unconstitutional. Highlights here. The ruble has risen around 0.8% against the US dollar, to 36.1 ruble to the $1, having hit an alltime low of 36.5 yesterday night. The recovery came after it emerged that Russian and Ukranian billionaires had lost almost $13bn in Monday\u2019s selloff. In other news... Cyprus\u2019s parliament has approved a privatisation plan, as part of its bailout. Activity in Greece\u2019s manufacturing sector has risen, but workers are still being laid off Britain\u2019s construction sector was hit by February\u2019s floods, with house-building growth slowing last month. EC commissioner Michel Barnier has criticised banks who are doing everything possible to avoid Brussels\u2019 clampdown on bonuses. REMINDER: Our liveblog on Ukraine is here. Just in, the Cyprus parliament has approved plans to privatise its electricity operator, telecoms provider and port authority as demanded by its lenders, a week after failing to approve the package. 30 MPs voted in favour of the plan, with 26 voting against. It paves the way for future tranches of Cyprus\u2019s bailout to be paid. Last Thusday, MPs narrowly failed to approve the plan - as striking workers protested in Nicosia. Reuters has more details: Cyprus\u2019s parliament approved a roadmap for privatisations on Tuesday, averting a showdown with international lenders insisting on state selloffs as part of a \u20ac10 euro ($13.77 billion) bailout. In a show of hands, 30 lawmakers in the 56-member parliament endorsed a guideline for asset sales just before a deadline for approval expired on March 5. Parliament\u2019s rejection of an earlier privatisation motion on Feb. 27 risked derailing the bailout accord brokered with the European Union and International Monetary Fund in March 2013. Democratic Party MPs, who had opposed the plan last week, changed sides and backed it today. PhD student George Iordanou isn\u2019t impressed: Over in Brussels, the EC Commission has issued a rebuke to banks who are trying to dodge its controls on bank bonuses. Michel Barnier, the EU commissioner for the single market, said he was determined to enforce transparency over bankers pay. He made the comments as the Commission formally adopted curbs on bankers pay, limiting bonuses to 100% of basic salary or 200% if shareholders give their approval. Last month, HSBC was criticised for giving senior staff new \u2018allowances\u2019, worth \u00a332,000 a week to its CEO. Barnier didn\u2019t name names, but declared that Brussels remains committed to the new rules. He said: Some banks are doing their utmost to circumvent remuneration rules. The adoption of these technical standards is an important step towards ensuring that the capital requirement rules on remuneration are applied consistently across the EU. These standards will provide clarity on who new EU rules on bonuses actually apply to, which is key to preventing circumvention. In addition, the European Banking Authority has a mandate to ensure consistent supervisory practices on remuneration rules among competent authorities. The Commission will remain vigilant to ensure that new rules are applied in full.\u201d Here\u2019s our Russia correspondent Shaun Walker on the Putin press conference, which came a few hours after the Kremlin calmed the situation by saying some troops on active duty in Western Russia will return home. Vladimir Putin is confident Russia\u2018s take over of the Crimean peninsula \u2013 where 16,000 pro-Russian troops are in control of the region\u2019s security and administrative infrastructure \u2013 will not descend into war. During a live address on Russian television, the president insisted that the armed forces of Russia and Ukraine were \u201cbrothers in arms\u201d. \u201cWe will not go to war with the Ukrainian people. If we do take military action, it will only be for the protection of the Ukrainian people,\u201dsaid Putin, adding that there was no scenario in which Russian troops would fire \u201con women and children\u201d. The Russian president continued: \u201cUkraine is not only our closest neighbour it is our fraternal neighbour. Our armed forces are brothers in arms, friends. They know each other personally. I\u2019m sure Ukrainian and Russian military will not be on different sides of the barricades but on the same side. Unity is happening now in the Ukraine, where not a single shot has been fired, except in occasional scuffles.\u201d Putin denied that the Russian-speaking soldiers occupying key Crimean military sites were Russian special forces, saying they pro-Russian local self-defence forces. \u201cThere are many military uniforms. Go into any local shop and you can find one,\u201d he said. More here: Russian takeover of Crimea will not descend into war, says Vladimir Putin The ruble is also gaining more strength, up 1.4% against the US dollar -- to 36.08 rubles to the $1. Putin also had an impact on the Moscow stock market. It has now recovered almost half of Monday\u2019s losses -- with the MICEX up over 5%. So roughly speaking , close to 50% of the $58bn wiped off the value of Russia\u2019s biggest companies has been added so far back today. Or around half a Sochi Olympics.... The FTSE 100 just hit its highest level of the day, up 105 points or 1.7% at 6813. That means it has clawed back all Monday\u2019s 101-point losses, and then a bit -- as Vladimir Putin made his first press conference since the Crimea crisis began. These news flashes appeared to be the catalyst for the triple-digit gains - calming concerns over Moscow\u2019s plans. 04-Mar-2014 11:10 - RUSSIA\u2019S PUTIN SAYS TOLD YANUKOVICH THAT HE HAS \u201cNO POLITICAL FUTURE\u201d 04-Mar-2014 11:11 - PUTIN SAYS YANUKOVICH WOULD HAVE BEEN MURDERED, IF HE HAD STAYED IN UKRAINE 04-Mar-2014 11:11 - RUSSIA\u2019S PUTIN SAYS PULLING AMBASSADOR FROM WASHINGTON IS \u201cLAST RESORT\u201d, WOULDN\u2019T LIKE TO SEE THIS HAPPEN Reminder - our Ukraine liveblog has full coverage of Putin\u2019s press conference. Shares are rallying higher as a relaxed-looking Vladimir Putin continues to defend his actions in Crimea (full coverage here). The FTSE 100 now up 96 points -- much higher and it will have recovered all yesterday\u2019s losses (when it fell 101 points). Vladimir Putin has described the turmoil in the financial markets as a tactical and temporary state of affairs, during his ongoing press conference on Ukraine (live on Sky News now, and streamed here). The Russian president also tried to pin some of the blame for the volatility on America, saying that there was already a degree of nervousness in the markets due to certain US policies (ie, the slowing of the Federal Reserve\u2019s huge stimulus programme). As Haroon Siddique is covering in his liveblog (here), Putin also told reporters that the overthrow of former Ukrainian president Yanukovych is unconstitutional. He said: The interim president is not legitimate. From the legal perspective it is Mr Yanukovych who is president. He also planning to host the G8 summit in June - but Western leaders \u201cdon\u2019t need to\u201d come if they don\u2019t want to. Ukraine\u2019s stock market is also surging today, up more than 7% with every share gaining ground. The UAX had yesterday matched Moscow with an 11% tumble. The Russian stock market has continued to romp ahead, with the MICEX up almost 4.5% now. Airline group Aeroflot is up 6.4% on optimism that Russia will escape economic sanctions, and also reflecting the falling oil price (down around 1% this morning). European markets are also buoyant. FTSE 100: up 72 points at 6780, +1% German DAX: up 84 points at 9443, +0.9% French CAC: up 59 points at 4350, +1.4% David Madden of IG reckons confidence has returned to the equity markets has been restored, as the stand off between Ukraine and Russia is no longer on red alert. The prospect of war is dwindling as Russian troops have been recalled to their bases \u2013 but we are not out of the woods yet. The drop in equity markets yesterday, and correction back today, highlights how volatile an issue this is. We may have pulled back most of yesterday\u2019s losses but the rally is fragile. Heads-up, Russian president Vladimir Putin is due to appear on TV shortly - it should be streamed here. (and covered in our Ukraine liveblog) Back on the Ukraine crisis. Jamie McGeever of Reuters has tweeted a handy chart showing which countries are most dependent on Russia\u2019s Gazprom. 10 countries, from Finland to Bulgaria, get at least 80% of their gas supplies from the company, it appears: This may help explain by European leaders have been more cautious than Washington about hitting Moscow with tough sanctions (see today\u2019s Guardian front page story) Activity among Britain\u2019s civil engineering firms jumped at the fastest pace since at least April 1997 last month, making it the best performing area of construction, Markit reported. That suggests that while flooding was bad news for housebuilders (see here), it meant more work for builders who could handle large infrastructure projects. Some UK building firms are also expecting a boost from the recent flooding, with pressure to avoid a repeat of the disruption suffered by thousands of families. Markt reports: Construction firms noted greater spending among local authorities on capital projects and maintenance, in some cases in response to recent flooding and adverse weather conditions. Britain\u2019s builders were hit by the heavy rain and flooding last month, but still recorded decent growth. Markit\u2019s UK construction PMI, which measures activity across the sector, fell back to 62.6 in February from from 64.6 in January (which was the highest since August 2007). Any reading over 50 shows the sector expanded. Building firms reported that the flooding which struck parts of the UK hit efforts to build new homes. House-building growth fell to a four-month low. But in brighter news, job creation hit a three-month high. David Noble, chief executive officer at the Chartered Institute of Purchasing &amp; Supply, said: \u201cBad weather took a bite out of progress in house building, but UK construction remains on a strong growth trajectory in February. The sector was fuelled by the strongest rise in civil engineering activity in the survey\u2019s history, as an increase in spending was recorded on investment and infrastructure projects in response to recent flooding. Even though both housing and commercial activity suffered a slide in pace of growth in February, the overall performance was one of continued expansion. Over to Greece, where the battered factory sector continues to shed staff despite a rise in business activity, according to Markit\u2019s monthly healthcheck. The Greek manufacturing PMI (based on interviews with purchasing managers) rose to a 66-month high of 51.3, up from 51.2 in January. That indicates another rise in activity. But while new orders and output rose, employment continued to drop. Markit warned: The pace of job shedding was in fact slightly faster than one month before. The survey found \u201canecdotal evidence\u201d of increased demand for Greek manufactured goods from both the domestic market and foreign clients. But it also reported that output prices fell at the fastest rate in four months, as deflation continues to grip Greece. My colleague Haroon Siddique is anchoring the Guardian\u2019s Ukraine crisis liveblog again today - here: Ukraine crisis: Shots fired at Crimea airbase - live updates This graph shows how the Micex index (+3.4%) has only recovered a third of yesterday\u2019s losses - meaning those Russian billionaires who lost $13bn on Monday have still shed a hefty chunk of wealth: Today\u2019s rally stock market rally underlines just short-term and reactive the financial markets can be, with news flashes and tweets swiftly pored over by investors and \u2018black box\u2019 trading machines. As Kit Juckes, Societe Generale\u2019s foreign exchange expert, puts: Tensions in the Ukraine and Crimea have (temporarily) been eased. Russian troops have finished their \u2018military exercise\u2019 and financial market tension is melting away. And no, of course it\u2019s not \u2018all over\u2019. The economic fallout, notably in Russia, will be significant and building political stability in the Ukraine remains a huge challenge. But financial markets are short-sighted animals and everything is calmer. Bloomberg has calculated that Russia and Ukraine\u2019s billionaires saw $12.8bn wiped off their collective fortunes yesterday, as global stock market slid. (details here). European stock markets are bouncing back, following the Russian stock market higher on hopes that the Ukraine crisis may be easing a little. News that Russian troops close to the Ukraine border will return to their camps by Friday sent the main indices bouncing back. Investors are calculating that the risk of military conflict between the two countries had fallen. The FTSE 100 index has leapt 80 points, or 1.2%, recovering most of yesterday\u2019s 101-point slide. Germany\u2019s DAX, which is heavy with companies with large exposure to the Russian economy is up almost 1%. It tumbled 3.4% yesterday, in its biggest one-day slide since November 2011. Spain, Italy and France are all up over 1%. And in Moscow, the MICEX is almost 4% higher as traders rush to buy stocks, a day after battling to dump their portfolios. The ruble is still also up 0.8% against the US dollar at 36.3 to the $. Ishaq Siddiqi of ETX Capital says share are rallying because \u201cglobal markets have been anxious that the mobilisation of Russian troops could mean something more serious.\u201d He added: Market sentiment remains fragile and anxious at best with traders transfixed with developments in the Ukraine. Russian troops began the military exercises almost a week ago, close to the country\u2019s border with Ukraine. Their presence had stoked fears that that could be mobilised into pro-Russian areas of eastern Ukraine. Bloomberg flags up that the exercises are ending \u2018on schedule\u2019, with the troops now expected back at their bases by this Friday, March 7. Here\u2019s Associated Press take on the latest developments in Ukraine: Vladimir Putin ordered tens of thousands of Russian troops participating in military exercises near Ukraine\u2019s border to return to their bases as U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry was on his way to Kiev. Tensions remained high in the strategic Ukrainian peninsula of Crimea with troops loyal to Moscow fired warning shots at protesting Ukrainian soldiers. It was not clear if Putin\u2019s move was an attempt to heed the West\u2019s call to de-escalate the crisis that has put Ukraine\u2019s future on the line. It came as Kerry was on his way to Kiev to meet with the new Ukrainian leadership that deposed a pro-Russian president, and has accused Moscow of a military invasion. The Kremlin, which does not recognize the new Ukrainian leadership, insists it made the move in order to protest millions of Russians living there. AP\u2019s full story is online here. UPDATED: Oil is also falling, with Brent crude dropping almost 1.5% to $109.60 per barrel. The gold price has dropped almost 1% this morning, down $11 per ounce at $1,338, having soared to a four-month high yesterday on the back of the Crimea crisis. Good morning. The Russian stock market is rallying this morning after yesterday\u2019s torrid selloff, on reports that Vladimir Putin has instructed troops on military exercises in Western Russia, close to Ukraine, back to base. Interfax reported early this morning that Putin had ordered \u201cRussian military units and divisions involved with surprise drills to return to their permanent bases\u201d. There\u2019s no specific reference to Crimea, though, after days of growing pressure on Moscow over the occupation of the peninsula over the weekend. Stocks leapt in Moscow as the news broke. After spiking 5%, the MICEX index settled up around 3% -- clawing back around a quarter of Monday\u2019s heavy losses in which around $55bn was wiped off the market. The ruble is also strengthening having hit record lows yesterday. It\u2019s up around 0.8% at 36.2 rubles to the US dollar. Oil and gold have also dropped in early trading, reflecting relief that the threat to the global economy could be easing. The news comes as John Kerry, US secretary of state, heads to the Ukranian capital, Kiev, later today, as Western government\u2019s debate how best to respond to Putin. Here\u2019s our latest Ukraine news story from last night: Ukraine crisis: US-Europe rifts on Russia surface I\u2019ll be tracking the latest development in the financial markets, the world economy, the eurozone and business through the day.",

      "bodyText": "The road car business of British Formula One team McLaren made a profit for the first time in 2013, a year earlier than expected, helped by its sellout \u00a3866,000 P1 supercar. McLaren Automotive, which started making cars in 2011 at the 50-year-old team's base in Woking, previously predicted the business would only break even last year. Mike Flewitt, McLaren Automotive's chief executive, said: \"We expected to break even in 2013 but we actually made a small profit so we're slightly ahead. It's a very significant development.\" The detailed profit figures are not yet available. The business launched its latest car \u2013 the 650S \u2013 at the Geneva motor show on Tuesday, priced from \u00a3195,250. It will be available from April and can achieve 0-62mph in three seconds and 0-124mph in 8.4 seconds. \"We have taken everything we have learnt from the 12C and the McLaren P1 and put it into this car,\" Flewitt said. The new car is significantly less expensive than the P1, which has sold out, with 51 people on the waiting list. McLaren limited production of the P1 to 375 vehicles, all of which are expected to have rolled off the production line by May next year. \"I committed to 375. There are days I regret that now, but part of the demand is driven by the exclusivity,\" Flewitt said. McLaren is placing no production limit on the new 650S, which will be faster, more powerful and more aerodynamically advanced than the McLaren 12C. McLaren Automotive, which employs about 1,000 people, produces about 1,500 cars a year and is hoping to increase that to 3,500-4,000 over the next three to four years. About 80% of the cars made in Woking are exported, and McLaren has 50 dealerships around the world, including one in China. Flewitt said there was no specific timeframe for a new McLaren supercar to succeed the P1 at the very top end and it would depend on another \"step change in technology\" which was likely to take \"at least five years, maybe 10\". McLaren Applied Technologies (MAT) \u2013 another spin-off business which is part of the F1 group \u2013 said separately it had won a four-year contract to increase efficiency at Heathrow airport, which handles more than 190,000 passengers a day. MAT will use modelling and simulation technology developed to win F1 races to help decrease the amount of time planes spend circling the airport, and improve their movement on the ground. The company is part of a consortium led by NATS, the air traffic services group. Geoff McGrath, MAT's vice-president, said: \"The combination of Formula 1 and one of the world's busiest airports may seem unlikely, but at both grand prix races and Heathrow airport we are seeking to achieve very similar goals \u2013 to increase efficiency, maintain the highest levels of safety and continually improve performance.\" More from the motor show A new model Jaguar will go on sale for under \u00a330,000 next year, the manufacturer announced. The Jaguar XE, a mid-sized sports sedan car, will go into production in the UK later this year, incorporating engines built at Jaguar Land Rover's recently opened plant in the West Midlands. The manufacturer said it also would be expanding its Land Rover Discovery range next year. Another British-made vehicle, the Mini Clubman \u2013 assembled in Cowley \u2013 was unveiled with a makeover: a stretched version that puts the small car in the same size bracket as the likes of the VW Golf. Elsewhere, Ford unveiled the latest facelift of the Focus, the world's best-selling car, including more advanced automatic parking and voice-activated navigation functions. Electric car manufacturer Tesla promised rapid expansion in Europe, including rolling out its rapid-charging network across the continent. Gwyn Topham",

    "webTitle": "Perfume manufacturers must cope with the scarcity of precious supplies", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The perfume industry is facing a major problem: maintaining constant levels of quality is crucial, but it is increasingly difficult to obtain a regular supply of all the necessary natural ingredients. Essential oils such as jasmine, rose, vetiver, ilang-ilang, iris, vanilla, sandalwood or lavender cannot be synthesised in the laboratory. But supplies are dwindling and need to be protected, in some cases by the perfume industry itself. In 1987, for example, Chanel made an agreement to buy all the jasmine flowers produced by the Mul family, which has been the main source of the flowers in France for five generations. Jacques Polge, Chanel's top \"nose\" since 1978, made the decision when developers started trying to buy up land around Grasse, where the Muls cultivate three hectares of the precious plant. The crop of fragrant white flowers \u2013 between 10 and 15 tonnes a year \u2013 is almost entirely used in Chanel No 5, the perfume created by Ernest Beaux in 1921 and now the world's biggest-selling fragrance. The smallest bottle (30ml) contains the equivalent of 1,000 buds. They are hand-picked in the morning to retain as much fragrance as possible, from August to October \u2013 and processed the same day. The partnership between Chanel and the Mul family has since been extended to include Provence rose, iris, tuberose and an old variety of geranium. The factory located nearby is both a laboratory and a processing plant. At Guerlain, a subsidiary of LVMH, the head perfumier Thierry Wasser was also responsible for starting jasmine production again in Calabria, Italy. \"I spend about a quarter of my time in the fields, talking to growers,\" he says. His quest for new fragrances has taken him as far as the mountains near Kashan, Iran, in search of the Damascus rose, still grown there using traditional methods. It features in a new eau de parfum. His work takes him to Tunisia too, to supervise the harvest of orange blossom, of which Guerlain distils 100 tonnes a year for its own use. Here too he sources bergamot, a favourite ingredient in his preparations. Wasser has set aside a bottle of rose oil, which he considers the most remarkable of last year's harvest. It is the result of a perfect balance between dew and sunlight. Much as with the best wines, the raw materials of perfume are always changing, affected by the soil, sunlight, rainfall and temperature. Their price varies too, depending on crop yields. None of the big three \u2013 Chanel, Guerlain and L'Or\u00e9al \u2013 have any immediate plans to invest more extensively in growing. They see raising the trees and flowers on which they depend for essential oils as a separate business. But Fran\u00e7ois Demachy, the nose at Christian Dior Parfums and head of the perfumes division at LVMH, reckons diversification into primary production as a likely move for the industry to make. He says he is \"considering [investing] further upstream\" in the long term. He is certainly concerned about \"availability problems\" for certain ingredients, which has prompted him to increase the range of sources for some flowers and even to seal an agreement with a Sri Lankan producer of sandalwood \u2013 a rare species protected by the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (Cites). \"What was Jean-Paul [Guerlain] thinking of when he put so much sandalwood in Samsara?\" his successor Wasser jokes. The price of the essential oil has rocketed since 1989 when the perfume was launched. Each bottle of perfume is made from raw materials whose quality and cost are sensitive to changes in agriculture, politics, natural disasters, climate and disease. All of which can be a major headache for perfumers. \"Rural flight has substantially reduced these micromarkets all over the world. Farmers are tempted to switch to cereals or oil-producing plants, which often pay much better than flowers. The growers who work for the perfume industry and their pickers do not earn a great deal,\" says Jean-Pierre Coutauchaud, head of speciality raw materials purchasing at L'Or\u00e9al. In the perfumes produced by L'Or\u00e9al (Tr\u00e9sor, Lanc\u00f4me, Armani), natural materials only account for 20% of ingredients, the rest being artificial. \"In Indonesia, the Chinese who used to farm the patchouli fields have been persecuted, forcing them to give up their crops, which in turn led to an incredible price rise,\" Wasser explains. For several months after the earthquake that devastated Haiti in January 2010 vetiver exports stopped, he adds. On the other hand, the Arab spring in 2011 did not affect the supply of jasmine, despite it being mainly sourced from Tunisia and Egypt. Nearer to home, the lavender fields of Provence have been severely damaged in recent years by insect-borne bacteria. \"We now keep reserves of strategic raw materials \u2013 such as vetiver, vanilla and lavender \u2013 selected on the basis of three criteria: they can't be synthesised, only come from a single geographical source and are needed in large quantities,\" says a spokesperson at Givaudan, which manufactures perfume for several brands. Givaudan, based in Vernier, Switzerland, is taking steps to mitigate shortages. It has launched schemes to protect and sustain sources of endangered raw materials. It has helped tonka bean growers in Venezuela, restarted sandalwood production in Australia, and helped to improve the quality of benzoin resin in Laos and ilang-ilang in the Comoros islands. Haiti produces half the world's supply of vetiver. Its roots yield an essential oil with a mysterious dry fragrance akin to smoked wood, which Haitians call the \"essence of tranquillity\". In 2012 Givaudan started working with Agri Supply, the main producer of the oil. Its refurbished vetiver distillery is now the largest in the world. Some 160 farmers in three villages in the Cayes district have formed a co-operative and negotiated a guaranteed minimum price. They also receive technical support from the Swiss firm.

According to projections by one of the biggest investors in \"prime\" property in the capital, that average flat could fetch \u00a336m by the middle of the century \u2013 if its predictions of 9%-a-year growth in prices become reality.

It claims the property price inflation seen over the past four decades in London's prime property areas \u2013 which it defines as the areas surrounding Hyde Park, from Notting Hill to Pimlico \u2013 will continue for decades to come. Hugh Best, LCP's investment director, said: \"The average price in prime central London is now \u00a31.5m, and has been growing at 9% a year, which we think is firmly sustainable. They have been growing at that level for 40 years and we see no reason for that to change.\" At a 9% growth rate, the average \u00a31.5m flat will fetch \u00a36.3m by 2030 and \u00a336m by 2050. In the shorter term, LCP, which has invested about \u00a3600m in London property, reckons speculators will earn even more \u2013 about 14% a year \u2013 over the next five years. The Crimea crisis would not halt London property's inexorable rise, said Naomi Heaton, LCP's chief executive. \"The Russians are only a part of the market and have been dwindling in number over the past few years \u2026 we could instead have the Ukrainians coming in with their money. London is the destination for the high net worth community of the world, and we are only just beginning to see the mainland Chinese. The loss of some Russian oligarchs is not a fundamental loss for the market.\" The Labour party has promised it will stop new developments being sold overseas before local people have a chance to buy, amid widespread concern that the capital is being hollowed out by overseas property speculators, which in turn pushes up prices further out in the city and the south-east. LCP claims that prime London and the rest of the UK should be seen as separate markets, and that prices paid for \"trophy\" properties have no effect on the mainstream market. \"With only 6,000 units changing hands last year, central London is arguably the greatest capital city in the world with the lowest availability to buy.\" Units bought by foreigners represented only 0.3% of the total transactions in England and Wales last year, said LCP. Boris Johnson, the mayor of London, said in January it would be \"utterly nuts\" to deter foreign investment in the housing market. But London assembly member Darren Johnson, who wrote the Crumbs for Londoners report, said encouraging investor-buyers had left residents renting expensive homes on insecure tenancies. \"Two-thirds of new homes in London are sold to investors. It doesn't matter whether they are from China or Kent, they are all driving up prices. Instead of encouraging this, the mayor should promote policies like land value taxation to reduce demand,\" he said.",

But all agree that after too many years of inadequate growth in advanced economies, substantial longer-term risks have emerged, not only for the wellbeing of these countries' citizens but also for the health and stability of the global economy.</p> <p>Those looking for ways to reduce the risks of inadequate growth agree that, of all possible solutions, increased business investment can make the biggest difference.

      "bodyText": "Some economists, like Larry Summers, call it \"secular stagnation\". Others refer to it as \"Japanisation\". But all agree that after too many years of inadequate growth in advanced economies, substantial longer-term risks have emerged, not only for the wellbeing of these countries' citizens but also for the health and stability of the global economy. Those looking for ways to reduce the risks of inadequate growth agree that, of all possible solutions, increased business investment can make the biggest difference.

Palmer issued a statement Tuesday reaffirming his opposition to the idea. Blaming Qantas\u2019s problems on \u201cboard and management failure\u201d, Palmer said the airline was a \u201cvital part of Australia\u2019s fabric\u201d and the government had a moral obligation to ensure it remained in Australian hands. Senators-elect David Leyonhjelm and Bob Day have both said they would support the government\u2019s proposed changes, but without votes from Labor, the Greens, Palmer United party, Xenophon and Madigan the changes cannot pass the new Senate.

The opposition leader, Bill Shorten, said the Coalition\u2019s plan for Qantas would take at least two years before it could be implemented, and accused the government of being \u201csingle-minded zealots\u201d and \u201cextremists\u201d who were acting on a \u201cgreat rush of blood to the head\u201d. He told parliament demerging the business would take time, during which thousands of jobs would be lost offshore. Senior government ministers hit the airwaves on Tuesday attempting to build pressure on Labor to support the changes. Abbott said: \u201cI just say to the party which sold Qantas, the Labor party, now it\u2019s time to free Qantas so that Qantas can have a future as one of the great airlines.\u201d The treasurer, Joe Hockey, told the ABC that Labor had been \u201cskiing down the hill in favour of privatisation, in favour of removing foreigner ownership restrictions and near the bottom of the hill, Bill Shorten puts up his hands and says, \u2018let\u2019s go ski back up the hill\u2019\u201d. Hockey insisted the government\u2019s approach in attempting to push changes to the Qantas Sale Act through parliament was \u201cnot about politics\u201d but instead a result of \u201cgood policy\u201d. Asked whether the government was ignoring the legislative reality, Hockey urged senators to pass the government\u2019s bill. \u201cI would say to them, if they care about Qantas workers, if they care about Qantas jobs, pass the legislation and free up Qantas,\u201d he told Sky News. The secretary of the Australian Council of Trade Unions, Dave Oliver, said Qantas employees were angry and upset at the government\u2019s decision to pursue changes that would see jobs go offshore. Oliver said he had a message for the Abbott government: \u201cDon\u2019t play politics with the lives of tens of thousands of workers at Qantas; they can still step up and provide the debt guarantee \u2026 It is not acceptable we have a government that simply wants to leave it to the market.\u201d Virgin Australia welcomed the government\u2019s decision to reform the act rather than offering its competitor a debt guarantee, saying it would foster \u201ccompetition in the Australian aviation market\u201d. But Qantas continued to urge the government to consider a debt guarantee \u2013 an option the government had previously said was under active consideration but which Abbott has now ruled out. Qantas said: \u201cWe need immediate action to address the imbalance that has been allowed to persist for almost two years \u2013 namely Virgin\u2019s unlimited ability to access foreign capital from government-owned airlines to fund a loss-making strategy against Qantas. \u201cIf this proposal by the government to change the Qantas Sale Act is not passed, we would expect the government and the parliament to consider alternative measures to balance the unlevel playing field in Australian aviation.\u201d Abbott appeared to suggest Qantas management might be part of the problem. \u201cLook, if you go back over the last decade, for much of the time Qantas has been hugely profitable.

The amendments would leave the carrier with little option but to follow rival Virgin\u2019s example and split its operations into a domestic business which could attract foreign owners and an international business that would have to remain majority Australian-owned in order to benefit from government-negotiated international landing rights. Under either the existing WA result (three Liberals, one Labor, one Sports party and one Green) or the original result that the ALP and the PUP wanted to stand (three Liberals, two Labor, one PUP) the government could have probably expected four votes in favour of most of its legislative proposals and two against from the six WA senators. If a new WA election resulted in the more usual breakdown of three Liberals, two Labor and one Green, or two Liberals, two Labor, one Green and one PUP or conservative-leaning independent, it would mean the government could expect three votes at most, handing more power to the crossbenchers.",

      "bodyText": "Labour would expand the role of the government's industry innovation centres to include apprentices and develop a wider range of skills, shadow business secretary Chuka Umunna is to tell a meeting of manufacturing bosses on Tuesday. After an industry survey showed the manufacturing sector grew strongly in February and is hiring new workers at the fastest pace in three years, Umunna will say that scientists and engineers in so-called \"catapult centres\" would be given more financial support and a role in training the next generation of highly skilled workers. The move is part of a wider review of Labour's industrial and economic policy before the next election and includes a pledge to safeguard British jobs in government procurement contracts. Nine catapult centres are due to receive \u00a31.4bn in public and private sector investment by 2016, according to the Department for Business, Innovation &amp; Skills. Some centres match funding for projects in offshore renewable energy and transport systems while others house research centres used by private firms in areas such as cell therapy and satellites. Between a quarter and a third of the cash is expected to come from public funds under the Treasury's budget plans. In a speech to the annual conference of the manufacturers' organisation EEF, Umunna will say that a Labour government would stay within current spending limits except those that restrict investment, in contrast to the coalition government's dramatic cuts to public investment spending. \"Catapult centres were a brainchild of the last Labour government, taken forward by this one. Just as they are at the cutting edge of technology, so we will support them to train apprentices in the latest and best ideas too,\" he will say. Labour policy chiefs have come to admire the work of Sussex University economist Mariana Mazzucato, who has argued that most technological innovations such as touch screens, the internet and geographical positioning systems (GPS) were sponsored by state organisations before they were adopted by the private sector. Figures for Britain's manufacturing sector showed a rise in new orders and production that maintained a growth spurt dating back to last spring. The Markit/CIPS purchasing managers' index moved up to 56.9 in February, from a revised reading of 56.6 in January, signalling improved conditions across the manufacturing sector for the 11th straight month. The figures combined with strong mortgage lending data from the Bank of England to show that the broad economic recovery was likely to feed into strong GDP growth in the first half of 2014. Lenders approved 76,947 mortgages in January, up from December's 72,798 and the highest number in a month since November 2007. But in a warning that many small- and medium-sized business are struggling to access credit, the central bank's data also showed another fall in business lending. The Bank said that lending to non-financial businesses fell in January, down \u00a3600m after a steeper fall of \u00a31.7bn in December. Lending to small businesses alone fell by \u00a3300m. Bank governor Mark Carney and other officials have played down suggestions that the housing market is overheating. Policymakers have given strong signals that base rates will remain at 0.5% until next year. But the continued buoyancy of lending on property while business lending shrinks has fed fears that house prices, which increased by more than 9% nationally over the last year, could create a bubble and subsequent crash. The government launched the Funding for Lending Scheme (FLS) with the Bank in 2012 to help lift the economy out of recession. The central bank made cheap funds available to banks and building societies on condition that they lent to UK households and businesses. Analysis by the Bank of the scheme showed that lenders have so far drawn down nearly \u00a342bn and net lending has risen by only \u00a310.3bn overall since its launch in July 2012. But Labour said a reduction in lending of \u00a32bn by Royal Bank of Scotland in the last quarter and \u00a35bn in the last nine months showed the government had failed to get a grip on the situation. \"A bank that has such large taxpayer support should be better serving British businesses and the real economy,\" it said. Former Liberal Democrat treasury spokesman Matthew Oakeshott said a \u00a31.3bn overall reduction in business lending in the last nine months showed the FLS was \"fatally flawed.\" He said: \"It has ramped up mortgages and house prices but failed Britain's small businesses.\" Markit said British manufacturers reported that the UK domestic market accounted for the biggest rise in sales.",

    "webTitle": "Vince Cable considers all-female shortlists for City firms' top jobs", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Vince Cable has asked the Equalities and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) to advise him on the legality of all-female shortlists for top City jobs as part of the coalition's latest push to get more women on to the boards of major companies. The business secretary acted after being presented with a report into the headhunting industry commissioned from Charlotte Sweeney, a former head of diversity at banks including HSBC and Nomura, which is published on Tuesday. Cable said: \"The headhunting community is a crucial catalyst to introduce more capable women in the boardroom. \"However, they can often be one of the first hurdles that talented, board-ready women face when trying to reach the top.\" The request from the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills for advice from the EHRC on whether a policy of positive discrimination could be legal is a big surprise. The British government has long argued that its voluntary code has stimulated a significant shift towards more women in Britain's boardrooms, and has vigorously opposed mandatory quotas compelling public companies to hire more female directors \u2013 a policy championed by Viviane Reding, European commissioner for justice and rights. Audrey Williams, a partner at global law firm Eversheds, said that excluding men from candidate lists was littered with legal problems. \"The difficulty with all-women shortlists is that it requires a selection to be made on the basis of gender, which, on the face of it, directly contravenes fundamental principles of EU law prohibiting sex discrimination. \"Whilst there is an exception in EU law which allows derogation from the principle of non-discrimination \u2026 this still requires assessment on merit and other conditions to be met. \"Any provision or guidance in support of all-women shortlists would have to be heavily qualified.\" In the UK, Lord Davies's 2011 Women on Boards report called for 25% of FTSE 100 directors to be female by 2015. At the time, just 12.5% of FTSE 100 directors were women \u2013 although that was more than the 7.8% in the second-tier FTSE 250. There were also 21 FTSE 100 companies with all-male boards. When the numbers were last analysed in January, they had risen to 20.4% for the FTSE 100 and 15.1% in the FTSE 250. Only two FTSE 100 companies \u2013 miners Antofagasta and GlencoreXstrata \u2013 currently have all-male boards. However, critics say the real rise in female boardroom representation has come from the hiring of non-executive directors, who fill part-time roles. Women make up just 7.2% and 5% of executive directors in the FTSE 100 and FTSE 250. Currently, there are just four women running FTSE 100 companies: Carolyn McCall at easyJet; Angela Ahrendts at Burberry; Alison Cooper at Imperial Tobacco; and Moya Greene at Royal Mail. A fifth, Liv Garfield, is joining Severn Trent this spring, although Ahrendts is quitting Burberry in mid-2014 to join Apple, and is to be replaced by Christopher Bailey. Sweeney's report also recommended that: \u2022 Headhunters should commit themselves to putting forward at \"least one strongly recommended woman on the shortlist for all board positions\". \u2022 A database of \"board-ready\" women should be created, to be shared with City firms and investor groups. \u2022 The industry should share its statistics on the percentages of male and female candidates \"during the various recruitment stages with government\". Sweeney said: \"Throughout my review there was a clear, articulated commitment from the majority of search firms to support the creation of more diverse and balanced boards. \"However, examples where the commitment was transferring into consistent and sustainable action were mixed. \"Further transparency across the industry will help identify where any further barriers are and inform where focused action is required.\" Davies will publish his latest annual update to his Women on Boards report this month.",
