Bank of England governor Mark Carney probably rates himself in that company (or, at the very least, superior to Sir Clive) and the Canadian will show up at the university's delightful campus this week to deliver his latest address to the nation. There he'll likely have another stab at his pet policy of \"forward guidance\" (aka guidance), where he attempts to keep interest rates down by persuading markets the Bank rate will stay at historic lows. The problem has been that, so far, the markets don't appear to believe him: gilt yields have been on the rise, with returns on 10-year bonds moving stubbornly with US Treasuries. Even short-term rates have increased. All of which will seem apt in Nottingham. Granger's principal contribution was recognising that all things do not revert to a fixed point or trend: with the classic analogy being of a drunkard's walk, which has little tendency to return to a straight line marking the path home. The theory's not really meant to apply to interest rates, but for the moment it looks apposite. At Granger's alma mater, Carney will again attempt to show he can guide the soak home. One thing the Co-op's dead good at \"We are good with money whichever way you look at it.\" So says the website of the Co-operative's financial services arm, but whichever way outsiders look at it, that slogan appears to be a bad joke.

The numbers will provide the backdrop for the deal to be offered to bondholders, which currently includes shares in a Co-operative Bank freshly listed on the stock exchange. The numbers will also show results for the whole of the Co-op \u2013 including food, travel and funerals, the latter of which has been highly successful. That's neat.

WPP spending spree In the world of advertising, much of the chatter still revolves around the $35bn merger between Publicis and Omnicom unveiled in July.

      "bodyText": "Flipping through the telly channels one night last week, I spotted joshing chefs the Hairy Bikers in greasy overalls, clambering all over a clapped-out traction engine. \"This is the important bit: we're going to talk about riveting,\" said the chap in charge of the loving revival of this piece of obsolete farm machinery. Riveting viewing it was not, but the Restoration Road Trip touches a nerve because it taps into nostalgia for a time when Britain cranked out engineers instead of hedge fund managers, and skilled workers built tangible end products instead of sitting in a call centre or behind a till. But it also raises a nagging disquiet about the radical transformation of the UK economy over the past 50 years. The collapse in manufacturing was by far the most striking trend in a fascinating chart from the Office for National Statistics last week showing changes since 1948, when industry made up more than 35% of output; today it is just above a tenth. It's not only fiftysomething men who hanker for the days when they could wield a rivet gun instead of a computer mouse. The change has brought other structural changes, such as yawning trade deficits, a hollowing-out of wages, and pitiful levels of capital investment. None of this appeared to matter terribly when the economy was rattling along at 2.5% a year, but even George Osborne has acknowledged that we are spending too much and making too little; and despite hints of a rebalancing in the latest GDP data, unless some of these trends are reversed, any recovery will be underwhelming at best. Professional economists' forecasts, hitched up to mathematical models that extrapolate past relationships into the future, tend to assume growth will eventually bounce back to some long-run average \u2013 the so-called trend rate. But as the thoughtful City analyst Andrew Smithers pointed out last week, in a note bluntly entitled \"The UK's Trend Growth is Seriously Overestimated\", economies' growth patterns can show sharp breaks, particularly when \u2013 as is true for the UK \u2013 they have endured a serious shock. He points out that Japan grew at a trend rate of more than 8% a year from 1955-1973, but that halved to 4% from 1973, after the oil crisis, plunged to just 1% from 1990 after the catastrophic crash, and has stayed there ever since. And the painful truth \u2013 not least for Labour \u2013 is that in the lead-up to the crisis, the economy was running on thin air. Investment by government and business combined has collapsed, not just over the past five years, but over a much longer period, from above 20% of GDP in 1990 to less than 15% today. That appeared not to matter in the early noughties, when machine tools seemed pass\u00e9, and bankers, management consultants and retailers were helping to generate rip-roaring growth with minimal capital investment. Yet that model was never going to be sustainable: UK exports tend to be mainly of goods, and the result of our dependence on services has been a persistent and worsening trade deficit. Osborne has rightly argued that we need to \"pay our way in the world\". Smithers argues that without a step-change in investment levels \u2013 and, as the coalition cracks down on immigration, without a fast-growing workforce \u2013 our long-run growth rate could be just 1%, perhaps even less. But boosting investment will take more than just waiting for companies to cheer up. Underinvestment has long been an achilles heel of the UK economy: partly the flipside of Britain's long, slow industrialisation, but also because of corporate short-termism. Costly investments in equipment, technology or training that might yield long-term benefits often mean a short-term hit to profitability, and to shares. Since executives' incentive plans tend to be linked to share prices, they often use any spare capital to buy back shares, giving the price a temporary, artificial boost, with no permanent benefit. Add in the fact that the banking sector is still hamstrung by bad debts from the boom years, and there's no hope of the investment revival without which an industrial renaissance is impossible. Labour has something to say about many of these problems. It would put shareholders on remuneration committees and employees on boards as a way of taming the bonus culture. It's looking at ways of rewarding firms that boost Britain's human capital with training. And it would set up a British investment bank to bypass the high-street banks. It could also do worse than pinch a few ideas from the LSE's excellent Growth Commission report, and promise to depoliticise national infrastructure decisions and beef up education for poorer kids. All of these would help to build a more solid, sustainable business model. But even if there is a coherent answer here to the question of what kind of economy we should build, Labour has two problems. First, it risks sounding either like a plea for a return to riveting, or like a ragbag of ideas hard to sum up in a slogan more convincing than the Tories' most likely line: \"Don't Let Labour Ruin It\". The second is that a fair chunk of the industrial neglect, deregulation and executive pay inflation that put the economy in trouble happened on Labour's watch. Somehow, Ed Miliband needs to capture the residual pride in industrial Britain summoned up by the Restoration Road Trip without sounding as irrelevant as a steam enthusiast.",

    "webTitle": "Silicon Valley can't spur innovation on its own \u2013 the state has a vital role", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The billionaire entrepreneurs of Silicon Valley have not all been recycling their earnings into Napa Valley vineyards. With publicity commensurate with their wealth and ambitions, such notable visionaries as Elon Musk (co-founder of PayPal, the online payments giant owned by eBay) have staked out claims at and beyond the frontier of available technology, from Tesla's all-electric cars to the proto spaceships of SpaceX. This is a moment when the Silicon Valley style and brand \u2013 Go Big or Go Home \u2014 has appeal. The recovery from the Great Recession remains frustratingly slow. In response, governments across the developed world have perversely embraced austerity. And authoritative voices \u2013 economist Robert Gordon of Northwestern University and Musk's co-founder of PayPal, Peter Thiel, among them \u2014 are publishing obituaries for the most recent \"new economy\", jointly created by the microchip, the computer and the internet. Can individual initiatives backed by personal fortunes reinvigorate the digital revolution and launch new transformational technologies? The short answer is no. To understand why, we need to read the relevant history of the innovation economy, from the early days of the first industrial revolution through to the gestation and commercial birth of our continuing digital revolution. However, it is important to recognise that the impact of the digital revolution itself is far from played out. Only 50 years on from the technical realisation of the programmable microprocessor, momentum is accelerating across a broad front. At the level of infrastructure, migration to the \"mobile cloud\" \u2013 the fourth generation of architectures \u2013 is irreversibly under way, rendering access to ever growing computing power ubiquitous. At the level of platform technologies that enable previously unimaginable applications, the ability to extract meaningful information from aggregations of human-generated \"big\" data is being realised, and not only by the world's security agencies. Potentially most revolutionary is the pervasive deployment of computerised speech recognition and its incipient extension into natural language understanding: Hal of 2001: A Space Odyssey will be riding with you in your pocket or on your wrist or on the bridge of your nose. In this context, it is useful to recognise that the \"killer app\" of the railway age \u2013 mail order retail \u2013 did not emerge until a full 50 years after the first \"railway mania\" on the London stock exchange. And reconstruction of manufacturing to take advantage of electrification plus the mass distribution of home appliances each reached its respective tipping point some 50 years after Edison turned on the first generating plant. If we need not concern ourselves excessively that the digital economy has (as it were) run out of steam, where should we look for leadership from the philanthropic angels of Silicon Valley? The most intensely needed innovations are among the host of technologies collectively referred to as greentech/cleantech. They promise radically to increase the productivity of carbon, enabling the switch to a low carbon economy. Some of these technologies are digital: smart meters, for example, that manage electricity consumption relative to actual usage. Delay in their deployment is political and economic \u2013 who pays for them \u2013 not technological. But most of these technologies, from solar cells to batteries, involve breakthroughs in materials \u2013 and entirely novel materials such as graphene. Moreover, movement to a new energy infrastructure for the global economy is as massive a proposition as the development of the railways and the deployment of electricity grids and the wired and wireless internet. And herein lies the double rub. First, commercialisation of new materials takes decades, during which production is reduced to cheap and reliable practice. In parallel, commercialisation also requires an extended search for applications in which the new material's characteristics allow it to replace what is already used, or induce the invention of entirely new applications. This is why \u2013 with one exception \u2013 new materials have invariably been commercialised by large, established enterprises (as plastics were by ICI, DuPont and General Electric), not by startups, however visionary their entrepreneurial leadership may be. And that singular exception \u2013 silicon \u2013 is the one that, as we shall see, truly proves the rule. Network building is the second challenge. Since the 1770s we have experienced five successive waves of technological innovation at sufficient depth and scale to generate \"new economies\". Each has depended on processes of trial-and-error and error-and-error: upstream inventions and downstream explorations of what the inventions are good for. And at the core of each has been the deployment of networks of transportation and communication whose value in use cannot be known at the outset of construction. So at each stage the innovation economy depends upon sources of funding unconcerned with near-term, quantifiable economic value. Angel investors have always played a role, from James Watt's partner Matthew Boulton on. But the complementary sources of institutional support for innovative investments at scale have been masses of financial speculators, participating in capital market bubbles, and the state, in pursuit of politically legitimate missions, from national development to national security. The canals and railways of the first two waves of innovation were supported by compulsory purchase orders in the UK and, in the US, by direct subsidies. In each case, financial manias followed. The electricity grids of the third wave attracted finance during the Roaring Twenties due to the provision by the state of regional monopolies. And the highways of the fourth, automobile revolution were directly constructed by the state as the multitude of car manufacturers sorted themselves out competitively. Silicon is the source material of the fifth, digital revolution. Its commercialisation was in substantial part led by entrepreneurial startups, notably Texas Instruments and Intel. Their distinctive success was directly due to the encompassing role of the American defence department. For the US government not only funded fundamental research across all the digital domains. It served as a creative, collaborative customer, pulling all its suppliers down the learning curve to low-cost, reliable production. The dotcom/telecom bubble at the end of the last century was its baby. We cannot expect the present generation of techno-philanthropists to replace the agencies of the state. Scale matters. For 25 years, from 1953 to 1978, federal funding accounted for more than half of all R&amp;D in the United States or about 1% of GDP. An equivalent amount would be more than $150bn today. Even the annual budget of the National Institutes of Health is \"only\" $35bn. There remains a time-honoured role for angels, beyond financing entrepreneurs seeking to exploit the new economic space created by transformational networks. Charles Darwin's father, heir to his father-in-law Josiah Wedgwood I's fortune, funded his son's investigations of natural history. And the first physics laboratory of the English-speaking world, the Cavendish at Cambridge, is named for its donor, the 7th Duke of Devonshire, William Cavendish. This tradition of philanthropic funding of scientific research continues to the present day. It has been most effective when management of the resources has been institutionally outsourced to responsible peer review, as embodied in Britain's Wellcome Trust and Cancer UK and America's Howard Hughes Medical Institute and the William and Melinda Gates Foundation. For entrepreneurial vision needs to be matched by disciplined rigour in execution, whether the project is upstream science or downstream venturing.

      "body": "<p>The billionaire entrepreneurs of Silicon Valley have not all been recycling their earnings into Napa Valley vineyards. With publicity commensurate with their wealth and ambitions, such notable visionaries as Elon Musk (co-founder of PayPal, the online payments giant owned by eBay) have staked out claims at and beyond the frontier of available technology, from Tesla's all-electric cars to the proto spaceships of SpaceX.</p> <p>This is a moment when the Silicon Valley style and brand \u2013 Go Big or Go Home \u2014 has appeal. The recovery from the Great Recession remains frustratingly slow. In response, governments across the developed world have perversely embraced austerity. And authoritative voices \u2013 economist Robert Gordon of Northwestern University and Musk's co-founder of PayPal, Peter Thiel, among them \u2014 are publishing obituaries for the most recent \"new economy\", jointly created by the microchip, the computer and the internet.</p> <p>Can individual initiatives backed by personal fortunes reinvigorate the digital revolution and launch new transformational technologies? The short answer is no. To understand why, we need to read the relevant history of the innovation economy, from the early days of the first industrial revolution through to the gestation and commercial birth of our continuing digital revolution.</p> <p>However, it is important to recognise that the impact of the digital revolution itself is far from played out. Only 50 years on from the technical realisation of the programmable microprocessor, momentum is accelerating across a broad front.</p> <p>At the level of infrastructure, migration to the \"mobile cloud\" \u2013 the fourth generation of architectures \u2013 is irreversibly under way, rendering access to ever growing computing power ubiquitous. At the level of platform technologies that enable previously unimaginable applications, the ability to extract meaningful information from aggregations of human-generated \"big\" data is being realised, and not only by the world's security agencies.</p> <p>Potentially most revolutionary is the pervasive deployment of computerised speech recognition and its incipient extension into natural language understanding: Hal of <em>2001: A Space Odyssey</em> will be riding with you in your pocket or on your wrist or on the bridge of your nose.</p> <p>In this context, it is useful to recognise that the \"killer app\" of the railway age \u2013 mail order retail \u2013 did not emerge until a full 50 years after the first \"railway mania\" on the London stock exchange. And reconstruction of manufacturing to take advantage of electrification plus the mass distribution of home appliances each reached its respective tipping point some 50 years after Edison turned on the first generating plant.</p> <p>If we need not concern ourselves excessively that the digital economy has (as it were) run out of steam, where should we look for leadership from the philanthropic angels of Silicon Valley? The most intensely needed innovations are among the host of technologies collectively referred to as greentech/cleantech. They promise radically to increase the productivity of carbon, enabling the switch to a low carbon economy.</p> <p>Some of these technologies are digital: smart meters, for example, that manage electricity consumption relative to actual usage. Delay in their deployment is political and economic \u2013 who pays for them \u2013 not technological. But most of these technologies, from solar cells to batteries, involve breakthroughs in materials \u2013 and entirely novel materials such as graphene.</p> <p>Moreover, movement to a new energy infrastructure for the global economy is as massive a proposition as the development of the railways and the deployment of electricity grids and the wired and wireless internet. And herein lies the double rub.</p> <p>First, commercialisation of new materials takes decades, during which production is reduced to cheap and reliable practice. In parallel, commercialisation also requires an extended search for applications in which the new material's characteristics allow it to replace what is already used, or induce the invention of entirely new applications.</p> <p>This is why \u2013 with one exception \u2013 new materials have invariably been commercialised by large, established enterprises (as plastics were by ICI, DuPont and General Electric), not by startups, however visionary their entrepreneurial leadership may be. And that singular exception \u2013 silicon \u2013 is the one that, as we shall see, truly proves the rule.</p> <p>Network building is the second challenge. Since the 1770s we have experienced five successive waves of technological innovation at sufficient depth and scale to generate \"new economies\". Each has depended on processes of trial-and-error and error-and-error: upstream inventions and downstream explorations of what the inventions are good for. And at the core of each has been the deployment of networks of transportation and communication whose value in use cannot be known at the outset of construction.</p> <p>So at each stage the innovation economy depends upon sources of funding unconcerned with near-term, quantifiable economic value. Angel investors have always played a role, from James Watt's partner Matthew Boulton on. But the complementary sources of institutional support for innovative investments at scale have been masses of financial speculators, participating in capital market bubbles, and the state, in pursuit of politically legitimate missions, from national development to national security.</p> <p>The canals and railways of the first two waves of innovation were supported by compulsory purchase orders in the UK and, in the US, by direct subsidies. In each case, financial manias followed. The electricity grids of the third wave attracted finance during the Roaring Twenties due to the provision by the state of regional monopolies. And the highways of the fourth, automobile revolution were directly constructed by the state as the multitude of car manufacturers sorted themselves out competitively.</p> <p>Silicon is the source material of the fifth, digital revolution. Its commercialisation was in substantial part led by entrepreneurial startups, notably Texas Instruments and Intel. Their distinctive success was directly due to the encompassing role of the American defence department. For the US government not only funded fundamental research across all the digital domains. It served as a creative, collaborative customer, pulling all its suppliers down the learning curve to low-cost, reliable production. The dotcom/telecom bubble at the end of the last century was its baby.</p> <p>We cannot expect the present generation of techno-philanthropists to replace the agencies of the state. Scale matters. For 25 years, from 1953 to 1978, federal funding accounted for more than half of all R&amp;D in the United States or about 1% of GDP. An equivalent amount would be more than $150bn today. Even the annual budget of the National Institutes of Health is \"only\" $35bn.</p> <p>There remains a time-honoured role for angels, beyond financing entrepreneurs seeking to exploit the new economic space created by transformational networks. Charles Darwin's father, heir to his father-in-law Josiah Wedgwood I's fortune, funded his son's investigations of natural history. And the first physics laboratory of the English-speaking world, the Cavendish at Cambridge, is named for its donor, the 7th Duke of Devonshire, William Cavendish.</p> <p>This tradition of philanthropic funding of scientific research continues to the present day. It has been most effective when management of the resources has been institutionally outsourced to responsible peer review, as embodied in Britain's Wellcome Trust and Cancer UK and America's Howard Hughes Medical Institute and the William and Melinda Gates Foundation. For entrepreneurial vision needs to be matched by disciplined rigour in execution, whether the project is upstream science or downstream venturing.</p> <p><em>William Janeway is a partner and senior adviser at Warburg Pincus, a visiting scholar in economics at Cambridge University, and the author of </em>Doing Capitalism in the Innovation Economy<em>, published by Cambridge University Press</em></p> <p>\u2022 This article was corrected on 25 August 2013 because it stated that 1% of US GDP would be more than $1.5tn.</p>",

    "webTitle": "Obama in crossfire as battle for control of the Fed hots up", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The fight of the summer in the US is stretching into August, even as most of Washington flees the city's heat for their holiday homes. The most important job in international finance is up for grabs, and the two leading candidates have polarised opinions across the political spectrum. President Barack Obama has said he will announce in the autumn who is to replace Ben Bernanke when he steps down as chairman of the Federal Reserve. The leading candidates, Larry Summers and Janet Yellen, are both economic superstars, but there the similarity ends. Summers appears to be the favourite, and despite the former Treasury secretary and ex-Harvard president being a longstanding liberal bete noire, there is a significant lobby effort behind him from the Obama administration. But Summers has a problem. People hate him. The hatred does not come just from the left. Long a controversial figure, with a prickly reputation and a chequered past, Summers is attracting ire from both sides of the House of Representatives. \"I wouldn't want Larry Summers to mow my yard,\" Republican senator Pat Roberts said recently. A majority of the female Democrats in the House, 38, have written to Obama urging him to back Yellen, the Fed's vice-chair and so far Summers's main opponent. Yellen is far less well-known than her rival but, like Summers, she is a star economist with a substantial CV, and has been credited with helping the Fed bring down unemployment. She would also be the first woman to head a central bank. There is some spin that the cautious, independent and methodical Yellen is not a \"team player\" \u2013 something Obama values. Should her name be put forward, more critics will no doubt emerge. Given current levels of hostility in Washington, no appointment Obama makes these days can avoid it. The US's most prestigious publications have carried editorials for and against the two candidates. Even Bette Midler has weighed in. On Twitter she called Summers \"Mr De-Regulation\" and said he had \"turned straitlaced banks into casinos and bankers into pimps\". At stake is the chairmanship of an organisation whose global influence has grown ever larger in recent years. The impact of the Fed's policies can be seen everywhere from the building booms in Istanbul to the recent gyrations in the Asian markets. On top of its global role, the Fed has beefed up its activities as regulator in the US. Whoever gets the job will be taking over a position more powerful than the one Bernanke inherited when he was appointed in 2006. Bernanke has yet to confirm that he is leaving, but he is widely expected to step down when his third term finishes at the end of January next year. A Reuters poll of economists gave Yellen the edge earlier this month, but ultimately this is Obama's decision and a look at the White House guest book shows significant support for Summers from within his administration. Summers has visited the White House 15 times since he stepped down as director of the National Economic Council in late 2010. Yellen has been just once. Many Democrats would agree with Midler that the main problem with Summers lies in his previous love of deregulation. In the late 1990s, Summers championed the end of the Glass-Steagall Act, which prohibited banks from taking part in speculative trading. He also helped to fight off an attempt to regulate derivatives, the complex financial instruments that later played a starring role in the 2008 financial crisis. His seeming willingness to back Wall Street's desires over main street's concerns continued under the Obama administration and he initially opposed a provision in the Dodd-Frank act, brought in after the financial crisis, that aimed to limit the risks banks were allowed to take. The author of that rule, former Fed chairman Paul Volcker, had clashed with Summers in the past. Volcker has steered clear of the Fed battle so far but in a recent article in the New York Review of Books, he once more decried the impact of deregulation on the economy. \"The erosion of confidence and trust in the financial world, in the financial authorities that oversee it, and in government generally is palpable.\" he said. \"That can't be healthy for markets or for the regulatory community. It surely can't be healthy for the world's greatest democracy, now challenged in its role of political and economic leadership.\" Sheila Bair, former chair of banking safety watchdog the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp, was more forthright. Calling Summers part of the \"deregulatory cabal that got us into the 2008 financial crisis\", she endorsed Yellen in Fortune magazine as the most qualified candidate. Yellen may prove a less controversial choice. A Fed veteran of two decades' standing and an expert on the labour markets, she is married to George Akerlof, a Nobel prize-winning economist she met during an early stint at the Fed. Wall Street may find her less accommodating than Summers has been in the past. The Centre for Public Integrity reviewed her career through two stints on the Fed board and as president of the San Francisco Fed Bank. The non-partisan, non-profit journalism group entitled its report: \"Yellen as Fed chair would be tougher on banks.\" Alan Blinder, former Fed vice-chairman, championed Yellen in a recent editorial in the Wall Street Journal. After underlining her talents and arguing that Fed minutes show she was among the first to foresee the extent of the financial crisis, Blinder delivered the killer blow: \"Perhaps the most important, but least understood, asset Janet Yellen would bring to the table is an ability to manage the fractious FOMC [the rate-setting Federal open market committee]. The committee is a peculiar debating society where politeness rules, politics is scorned, and intellectual arguments hold great sway. It's now populated by a bunch of strong-willed people who don't just defer to the chairman. Managing such a nearly unmanageable group requires a delicate blend of intellect, diplomacy and persuasiveness, plus the ability to disagree without being disagreeable \u2013 all quintessential Yellen traits.\" Few would care to argue that the rebarbative Summers has the ability to disagree without being disagreeable. But for someone seen as off-puttingly sharp, Summers has some powerful friends. An article in the Washington Postsaid that Timothy Geithner, who recently stood down as Treasury secretary, is now advising Summers on how he can overcome opposition. Obama, too, has been effusive in his praise: \"He was the rock of Gibraltar on trying to work through policies to turn the economy around, and I'm not going to stand idly by and let his name be disparaged and his reputation trashed because people have a political agenda about who should or should not be the chairman of the Federal Reserve,\" the president told Democrats recently. Not that Obama's praise is likely to sway opponents of Summers. These include Democrat senator Jeff Merkley, a member of the Senate banking committee. He told Bloomberg News he was \"extraordinarily sceptical\" about Summers' suitability. \"If you nominate someone who is a life-committed deregulator to be in a regulatory position, and if you believe regulation is necessary to prevent fraud, abuse, manipulation and so forth, then there's a lot of questions to be asked. Why is this person appropriate?\" he said. With Summers receiving such a bruising even before any nomination, Obama too seems to be hedging his bets now. During a recent meeting with Democrats, he mentioned the possibility of a third candidate, former Fed member Donald Kohn. It's clearly a decision he is not taking lightly. Obama said recently that the appointment \"is definitely one of the most important economic decisions I will make in the remainder of my presidency. The Federal Reserve chairman is not just one of the most important economic policymakers in America. He or she is one of the most important policymakers in the world.\"",

      "body": "<p>The fight of the summer in the US is stretching into August, even as most of Washington flees the city's heat for their holiday homes. The most important job in international finance is up for grabs, and the two leading candidates have polarised opinions across the political spectrum.</p> <p>President Barack Obama has said he will announce in the autumn who is to replace Ben Bernanke when he steps down as chairman of the Federal Reserve. The leading candidates, Larry Summers and Janet Yellen, are both economic superstars, but there the similarity ends.</p> <p>Summers appears to be the favourite, and despite the former Treasury secretary and ex-Harvard president being a longstanding liberal bete noire, there is a significant lobby effort behind him from the Obama administration. But Summers has a problem. People hate him.</p> <p>The hatred does not come just from the left. Long a controversial figure, with a prickly reputation and a chequered past, Summers is attracting ire from both sides of the House of Representatives. \"I wouldn't want Larry Summers to mow my yard,\" Republican senator Pat Roberts said recently. A majority of the female Democrats in the House, 38, have <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/07/31/house-democrats-janet-yellen_n_3683929.html\" title=\"\">written to Obama urging him to back Yellen</a>, the Fed's vice-chair and so far Summers's main opponent.</p> <p>Yellen is far less well-known than her rival but, like Summers, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/aug/22/janet-yellen-chair-federal-reserve\" title=\"\">she is a star economist with a substantial CV,</a> and has been credited with helping the Fed bring down unemployment. She would also be the first woman to head a central bank. There is some spin that the cautious, independent and methodical Yellen is not a \"team player\" \u2013 something Obama values. Should her name be put forward, more critics will no doubt emerge. Given current levels of hostility in Washington, no appointment Obama makes these days can avoid it.</p> <p>The US's most prestigious publications have carried editorials for and against the two candidates. Even Bette Midler has weighed in. On Twitter she called Summers \"<a href=\"https://twitter.com/BetteMidler\" title=\"\">Mr De-Regulation</a>\" and said he had \"turned straitlaced banks into casinos and bankers into pimps\".</p> <p>At stake is the chairmanship of an organisation whose global influence has grown ever larger in recent years. The impact of the Fed's policies can be seen everywhere from the building booms in Istanbul to the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/jun/13/eurozone-crisis-greece-strike-markets-ftse#block-51b967cbe4b039fbe778b50d\" title=\"\">recent gyrations in the Asian markets</a>. On top of its global role, the Fed has beefed up its activities as regulator in the US. Whoever gets the job will be taking over a position more powerful than the one Bernanke inherited when he was appointed in 2006.</p> <p>Bernanke has yet to confirm that he is leaving, but he is widely expected to step down when his third term finishes at the end of January next year. A <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/08/14/us-economy-poll-fed-idUSBRE97D0UT20130814\" title=\"\">Reuters poll </a>of economists gave Yellen the edge earlier this month, but ultimately this is Obama's decision and a look at the White House guest book shows significant support for Summers from within his administration. Summers has visited the White House 15 times since he stepped down as director of the National Economic Council in late 2010. Yellen has been just once.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-415722913\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2013/8/23/1377271263955/Fed-vice-chair-Janet-Yell-009.jpg\" alt=\"Fed vice-chair Janet Yellen, left, and former Treasury secretary Larry Summers. \" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Fed vice-chair Janet Yellen, left, and former Treasury secretary Larry Summers.  Photograph: Eugene Hoshiko and J. Scott Applewhite/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Many Democrats would agree with Midler that the main problem with Summers lies in his previous love of deregulation. In the late 1990s, Summers championed the end of the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2010/jan/28/glass-steagall-act-glossary\" title=\"\">Glass-Steagall Act</a>, which prohibited banks from taking part in speculative trading. He also helped to fight off an attempt to regulate derivatives, the complex financial instruments that later played a starring role in the 2008 financial crisis.</p> <p>His seeming willingness to back Wall Street's desires over main street's concerns continued under the Obama administration and he initially opposed a provision in the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2010/mar/16/chris-dodd-financial-industry-reforms\" title=\"\">Dodd-Frank act</a>, brought in after the financial crisis, that aimed to limit the risks banks were allowed to take. The author of that rule, former Fed chairman <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2010/feb/02/paul-volcker-senate-banking-testimony\" title=\"\">Paul Volcker</a>, had clashed with Summers in the past.</p> <p>Volcker has steered clear of the Fed battle so far but in <a href=\"http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2013/aug/15/the-fed-big-banking-crossroads/\" title=\"\">a recent article in the <em>New York Review of Books</em></a>, he once more decried the impact of deregulation on the economy. \"The erosion of confidence and trust in the financial world, in the financial authorities that oversee it, and in government generally is palpable.\" he said. \"That can't be healthy for markets or for the regulatory community. It surely can't be healthy for the world's greatest democracy, now challenged in its role of political and economic leadership.\"</p> <p>Sheila Bair, former chair of banking safety watchdog the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp, was more forthright. Calling Summers part of the \"deregulatory cabal that got us into the 2008 financial crisis\", she <a href=\"http://finance.fortune.cnn.com/tag/sheila-bair/\" title=\"\">endorsed Yellen in <em>Fortune</em> magazine</a> as the most qualified candidate.</p> <p>Yellen may prove a less controversial choice.
