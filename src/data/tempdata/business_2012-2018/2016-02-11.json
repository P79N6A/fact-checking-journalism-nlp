      "bodyText": "That\u2019s an appropriate moment to stop. Back tomorrow, for another day of market drama - plus the latest eurozone growth figures, starting with France at 6.30am GMT. Here\u2019s our latest news story: Better get some sleep :) Goodnight! GW Today\u2019s selloff in Asia, Europe and America have pulled global stocks into bear market territory. Reuters has the details: Stock indexes worldwide stumbled on Thursday on fears over the health of the global economy, with a global equity benchmark index closing the day more than 20 percent below its record high last May, confirming global stocks are in a bear market. MSCI\u2019s all-country world equity index which tracks shares in 45 nations, was last down 4.73 points, or 1.32%, to 353.35. The index hit its lowest level in more than two and a half years and was down 20.18% from an all-time high close of 442.70 on May 21, 2015. As we\u2019ve been covering today, this fall into bear market territory began with hefty losses in Hong Kong. Its stock market fell by 4%, on the first day\u2019s trading since the Lunar New year holiday. The baton then passed to Europe, which fumbled it. Bank shares had a very poor day indeed, on escalating fears that they will struggle to handle an economic slowdown, and lower negative interest rates. In nervous trading, shares slumped and government bonds soared, while oil took a dive and gold rallied. That tee\u2019d up America for its fifth daily fall in a row, as Fed chair Janet Yellen repeated her concerns that financial conditions are deteriorating. Uncertainty over US monetary policy going forward - will rates be hiked, cut, or even go negative? - weighed on shares again. It looks like the S&amp;P 500 has finished at its lowest closing level since April 2014, at 1829 points. Financial shares in the S&amp;P fell by 3%, bringing 2016 losses to roughly 18%, points out our US business editor Dominic Rushe. Here\u2019s the main movers and shakers: The Dow has lost around 4.6% of its value since last Thursday - the last time it posted a daily rise. The index is down 10.1% since the start of this year. This is the fifth day running in which the Dow Jones index has lost ground. Reminder: Tonight\u2019s losses in New York follow another day\u2019s torrid trading in Europe. Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 has another day to forget, losing 2.4% as investors raced for safe-haven assets such as German bonds, the yen, and gold. The Footsie, which includes the top 100 companies in London, closed at its lowest level in three and a half years. Our friends at the Daily Telegraph have worked out that \u00a380bn has been wiped off the FTSE 100 index this week. And there\u2019s still one day to go.... Phew! America\u2019s stock market has closed for the night, and the main three indices are all in the red. The Dow ended the day down around 251 points, having clawed back from a 400-point loss an hour or so ago. And the Nasdaq wilted in the final moments, surrendering earlier gains to finish down 0.4%. Shares picked up after the WSJ reported that Opec might be prepared to cut oil production. But financial stocks dragged again, with Goldman Sachs down 4.1%, and JP Morgan losing 3.98%. The biggest Dow faller was Boeing, following reports that regulators are investigating the airline maker. The latest research note from French Bank BNP Paribas just landed in my inbox. Here\u2019s their \u2018big picture\u2019 view: Central-bank action looks uncoordinated and we see few signs of calm ahead. We expect no further action from the Fed in 2016 or 2017 and we think central banks across the world will continue to adopt easier policies in response. It looks like traders are trying to give the Dow a late push. It\u2019s now down 188 points, or half its earlier losses..... Hello hello.... look at the Nasdaq. The tech stock-heavy index has shrugged off its earlier losses, and is now up 7 points (or 0.2%). Leading the way are: TripAdvisor: +13% Cisco +10% Expedia +8.5% Tesla: +6.3% That still leaves the Nasdaq down 6.9% this month, and 13% since the start of the year. Now that today\u2019s OPEC rumour has sunk in, Wall Street is still in red, but off its lowest levels. The Dow is currently down 273 points, or -1.7%, with just 40 minutes until the closing bell. This final hour can be a volatile time.... This is the story that moved the market a few minutes ago, by Summer Said of the Wall Street Journal. OPEC members are ready to cooperate on a cut, but current prices are already forcing producers outside the group to at least cap output increases, says UAE Energy Minister Suhail bin Mohammed al-Mazrouei. Non-OPEC supplies are expected to drop up to 800K barrels/day while global demand growth is seen at 1.3M\u2013which will help the market balances itself. \u201cThe positive thing is the current market is forcing everyone not to increase output,\u201d says al-Mazrouei, adding, \u201cI\u2019m optimistic that the balance will happen this year despite the oversupply and stocks overhang.\u201d  Interesting stuff. But it\u2019s not exactly definitive proof that OPEC is about to cave in and axe production. Energy stocks are suddenly spiking, pulling the US stock market off its lowest levels. And it\u2019s triggered reports that the energy minister of the UAE has said Opec members are \u201cready to co-operate\u201d on production cuts. Rumours of this sort have been swirling, and then denied, for some time. But maybe this time it\u2019s different.... Wow. The Dow just lurched through the 400-point loss mark, as news of the latest tumble in the oil price broke. Then it ricocheted back, to \u201cjust\u201d 340 points down in a few moments. Oil has just plumbed new depths, as oversupply fears and global recession worries take their toll again. West Texas Intermediate (US crude oil) has sunk below $26.19 per barrel, to hit the lowest levels since May 2003. There\u2019s no let-up in the market gloom today, with the Dow Jones industrial average still down over 2%. The Dow is currently trading at 15,570, a loss of 344 points. Only two stocks are up - network equipment vender Cisco, and entertainment group Walt Disney (who posted strong results earlier this week). Boeing is the big faller; the aircraft maker has lost 8.9% today following reports that regulators are probing the company\u2019s accounting. Reuters also blames \u201cmounting concerns\u201d about Boeing\u2019s its slowing sales and production. Following close behind in the losers bench are Goldman Sachs (-4.4%) and JP Morgan (-4.2%). They\u2019re tracking the general sell-off in financial stocks today. Two months after the first US rate rise in a decade, the financial markets reckon the Fed is more likely to CUT, rather than risk a second hike. Kit Juckes, top currency strategist at Societe Generale, reckons that the market turmoil has been sparked by a loss of faith in central bankers. In a new note to clients, he writes: We\u2019ve relied on central bankers to fix all the world\u2019s woes, when all they could really do was to get the global financial system back on an even keel. Keeping policy too easy for too long and boosting asset markets in the vain hope that this would deliver a sustainable demand pick-up has meant that even a timid attempt at normalising Fed policy has caused two months of mayhem. Now, a growing realisation that central banks\u2019 powers are waning has prompted a rush into safe havens. And, of course, years of ultra-loose monetary policy have also led us to this point: We\u2019re just getting the stickers saying \u2018Easy Money may cause harmful side-effects if consumed persistently for long periods\u2019 printed.... Yellen\u2019s second and final testimony ends with chairman Richard Shelby suggesting a review of the Fed\u2019s structure. She seems unconvinced but says it is up to Congress. And with that it\u2019s over. A cocktail of concerns has sent markets tumbling again. Worries about a severe global economic downturn, stresses on bank balance sheets, the falling oil price and Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen\u2019s comments about the impact of a slowdown and the market turmoil on the US economy have sent investors scurrying away to havens such as gold. Yellen\u2019s comments about negative interest rates added to the unease as the afternoon wore on. The final scores in Europe showed: The FTSE 100 fell 135.33 points or 2.39% to 5536.97, its lowest level since the end of July 2012 Germany\u2019s Dax dropped 2.93% to 8752.87 France\u2019s Cac closed 4.03% lower at 3896.71 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB finished down 5.63% at 15,773.00 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended down 4.88% at 7746.3 In Greece, the Athens market fell 1.89% to 440.88 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 349 points or 2.2%. Charles Schumer of New York says the strength of the US dollar is another form of rates rise so another hike would be a double whammy for the economy. Yellen says the dollar is a factor in interest rate policy, but says although some sectors have been hit by the strength of the US currency the economy has managed to continue creating jobs. Heller: A year ago you said falling oil would be good for the economy. Do you think you made a mistake. Yellen: Clearly declining oil prices have had some negative effects [on the economy]. [But] we are still a net importer of oil, and households are seeing sustantial gains from falling oil price. Dean Heller of Nevada: Different Fed officials saying different things causes confusion to public and markets. Do you see a problem? Yellen: Congress created a system with a large committee with diverse views so we did not fall into groupthink mentality. We have 17 members with a range of views. We have guidelines for communications. It says everyone should make clear they are speaking for themselves, not the committee. The market response to the Fed rate decision for a number of weeks was tranquil, it had been communicated and was expected. At the turn of the year markets saw more volatility. The drivers were China and oil price falls amid weakening global growth, so I don\u2019t think it was our policy. Yellen is asked again about the rate rise at the end of last year. Yellen: We felt in December the economy was moving up and inflation would go up. A lot has gone on since then. We are in the process of assessing how those developments affect our outlook. We will meet in March and have a new set of projections. I\u2019ve not thought that a downturn sufficient to make the next move a cut was a likely possibility. Not seen a shift in economic outlook to make that likely. But she added that if things changed to make that appropriate, the Fed would look at it. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts asks about living wills for banks, which are designed to make sure if they fail there will not be a systemic risk, and says there are 11 where they were deemed not to be sufficient and have been resubmitted. Yellen: We gave detailed guidance about what we want to see in these latest rounds of living wills. We are..evaluting them. If a living will does not address the shortcomings, we are prepared to make the finding that the living will is insufficient. Tom Cotton of Arkansas asks the December rate rise, and Yellen says the Fed wanted to move gradually so that the economy remained on a sustainable growth path. Cotton then asks about when she expects energy prices and the dollar to stabilise. Yellen: Energy prices have continued to move down, eventually they will stabilise. When that happens and the dollar stabilises, inflation will begin to move up but [difficult to predict when.] Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania: I wanted the Fed to normalise policy [ie start raising rates again which happened in December]. Markets now appear to price in no further increases in interest rates. But what are the risks of negative rates? [He lists several including pressure on banks, the prospect of currency war, an effective tax on savings and so on] Yellen: In European countries which have [introduced negative rates], I was surprised it was possible to take them as negative as they did. Don\u2019t think they pass on negative rates to small depositors, which means bank\u2019s margins are squeezed. They [other central banks] were concerned about inflation being below objectives and wanted to stimulate economy. In our context, in 2010 we were concerned about the impact on money market functioning. Before we took such a step we would have to see how they worked in US context. But we don\u2019t even know if clearing and settlement systems would be able to handle negative rates. Toomey asks about the legal position, saying a Fed memo seemed to suggest there could be a probem. Yellen: A memo from 2010 said legal issues had not been studied. I am not aware of any legal restriction that would mean we could not establish negative rates but I haven\u2019t studied legal side of it. Question from Bob Corker of Tennessee : Is Fed out of ammunition unless you go to negative rates? If things go south are you considering negative rates? Yellen: The answer is we had previously considered them and decided they would not work well back in 2010. In light of others [introducing them], we are taking a look at them again because we would want to be prepared. We have not finished that investigation. Not automatic they would work well here. I would not take them off the table, but there is work to do to see if they would be suitable. Senator Jon Tester of Montana: What is Fed seeing in housing sector right now? Yellen: We are seeing recovery in housing, it has gone on for a number of years but is very gradual. House prices have increased quite a bit. [But] the level of new construction remains quite low relative to demographic trends. Quite a significant way for housing to go before it is consistent with demographic trends. It is a support to the economy. Senator Mike Crapo asks: Would you agree liquidity in bond markets may be less available in stressed market conditions. Yellen: Normal conditions haven\u2019t changed that much but perceptions suggest that under stressed conditions liquidity may disappear when its most needed. We are looking at these things... Asked about wages, she says a pick up in wage growth is tentative. She hopes as the economy improves this will increase. Chair Richard Shelby asks if the precipitous decline in the price of 0il and gas plus the rise of the dollar surprised the Fed or could you have predicted it? Yellen says the Fed and the markets have been quite surprised by movements in oil price. In part they reflect supply isssue, demand may also play a role. The stronger dollar we in some ways anticipated as US economy has been performing more strongly than others. But she says they were surprised at how much it has risen. Asked about the economy and recession, she says there is always some chance of recession in any year. But evidence suggests expansions don\u2019t die of old age. We are looking very carefully at global financial developments which create risk... they may influence the trajectory of the economy and monetary policy. It is premature to make a judgement [on a recession this year]. On the strength of banks: We have a more resistent banking system. We have used stress tests to see if firms can support credit needs of our economy even in times of great [financial] stress. We do have a strong banking system and we\u2019ve seen marked improvement. Here\u2019s a chart showing how the chances of a Fed rate rise have dropped sharply since January in the wake of the market turmoil and Yellen\u2019s comments: After opening comments from committee chair Richard Shelby and senator Sherrod Brown of Ohio, Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen is currently delivering her testimony (identical to yesterday\u2019s speech remember). Meanwhile markets seem to have recovered a little from their worst levels. Analyst Connor Campbell at Spreadex said: Initially threatening a 300 point plunge when the bell rang on Wall Street the Dow Jones settled into a more solid, if still troublesome, 175 point drop as the open receded into the background. Whether or not the better than expected, and best since December, jobless claims helped (it probably didn\u2019t) is unclear, though at this point in time in the most worthless piece of positive news is likely appreciated by fear-stricken investors. The Dow was probably saved (and this is all relative, remember) by the fact that the blood loss endured by the US banking sector was nowhere near as gory as the scenes over in Europe, Bank of America the worst hit at around a 4% decline. In Europe things were much the same, i.e. not too good at all. The FTSE just about managed to claw its way back to the 5600 mark, arguably thanks to the fact that Brent Crude is now closer to $31 per barrel than it is to $30. The DAX, meanwhile, tucked under a 2% decline around 40 points away from 8900, whilst the CAC climbed down from its 3.7% nadir to post a 2.7% loss, both indices aided by a (minor) reduction in losses form Deutsche Bank and Societe Generale respectively. The big question now is, does today\u2019s horrorshow continue into Friday? Given just how fearful investors appear to be at the moment it is incredibly hard to tell; one thing tomorrow does have going for it, however, is data. Lots and lots of it. Germany, Italy and the Eurozone as a whole reveal their preliminary fourth quarter GDP figures, whilst the US sees retail sales, import prices and the University of Michigan consumer sentiment number. The markets will be hoping (nay, praying) that, with a bit of distraction (like on Wednesday), the week can end on a slightly more positive note. Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen is back on Capitol Hill to discuss the global outlook and monetary policy with the Senate Banking Committee, the second and last day of her testimony to Congress. The hearing has begun and can be viewed here. Elsewhere Morgan Stanley has agree to pay $3.2bn relating to the sale of mortgage-backed bonds before the financial crisis. Ahead of Yellen\u2019s testimony, some think it is time for a US rate cut: As predicted, the US market has followed the rest of the world lower. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 243 points or 1.5%, while the S&amp;P 500 has lost 1% and Nasdaq 1.3%. Meanwhile the International Monetary Fund has confirmed that Christine Lagarde has been nominated for a second five year term as managing director unopposed. Her first term ends in July. Well, here\u2019s the answer to the question about whether Janet Yellen would change her testimony from Wednesday\u2019s remarks in the light of the day\u2019s renewed market turmoil. No. The Fed said: Chair Yellen submitted identical remarks to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs, U.S. Senate, on February 11, 201. So if you want to read along with Yellen at 10am EST (3pm GMT) here it is again. Here\u2019s some comments on Portugal and Greece from Slovakia\u2019s finance minister Peter Ka\u017eim\u00edr ahead of the eurogroup: Bloomberg points out another possible reason behind the plunge in bank shares: Oil rich Gulf states have of course been hard hit by the plunge in crude prices. Now here\u2019s a key question about today\u2019s second testimony from Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen: Over in Brussels, eurozone finance ministers are telling reporters that the European banking sector is in good shape, as they arrive for a Eurogroup meeting. Eurogroup president Jeroen Dijsselbloem revealed that ministers will consider the market turbulence during today\u2019s session. European commissioner Pierre Moscovici was pretty optimistic too: And Finnish finance minister Alex Stubb was \u201crelaxed\u201d about the situation: Out of the mists of gloom comes some good news, in the shape of the weekly US jobless figures. They show that the number of Americans filing new unemployment claims fell by 16,000 last week, to a seven-week low. The initial jobless claims figure came in at 269,000, down from 280,000. So, US companies kept hiring staff last week, despite the market turmoil. World stock markets are gripped by another bout of feverish selling today. Fears over the global economy and the financial sector have hit shares, driven down (most) sovereign bond yields, and sent wild gyrations through the foreign exchange markets. In London, the FTSE 100 has hit a three and a half-year low. The blue-chip index is currently down 120 points, or 2%. Financial stocks are under real pressure, with Aberdeen Asset Management, Prudential and Barclays all down 6%. Other European markets are being routed too, with the French CAC plunging by 3.5%, Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB losing 5%(!) and German DAX off by 2%. Wall Street is expected to follow suit, with the Dow being called down 280 points or almost 2%. The day began with a big selloff in Asia, as traders returned after the Lunar New Year. Hong Kong\u2019s stock market slid by 4%. Maike Currie, investment director for personal investing at Fidelity International, says investors face volatile markets: \u201cFebruary has continued much like January begun, with markets yo-yoing and investor sentiment swinging from one concern to the next. The FTSE 100 broke the 5,500 barrier today \u2013 hitting a new low since July 2012. \u201cInvestors can\u2019t be blamed for feeling unnerved. There is a cocktail of worries clouding the investment horizon from a slowing China, emerging market rout, the unprecedented collapse in the oil prices and more recently, the problems brewing in the banking sector. Bank shares are in the eye of the storm again: France\u2019s Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale has tumbled by 13% after warning that \u201cheadwinds\u201d could hit profitability this year. Deutsche Bank is down by 9%, two days after insisting it was \u201crock-solid\u201d. The dollar has fallen sharply against the yen, before suddenly rebounding, sparking rumours that the Bank of Japan has intervened to weaken its currency. And the British pound has fallen by over a cent against the US dollar to $1.439. Money has poured into German, US and UK government debt. This has driven down Britain\u2019s cost of borrowing to an alltime low. But Portugal\u2019s bonds have weakened, sparking fears that investors are worrying about Lisbon again. Sweden\u2019s central bank fired another shot in the currency wars, surprising the markets by slashing interest rates to a new record low of minus 0.5%. The oil price has weakened again, with US crude oil trading at levels last seen in 2003. But gold has jumped by 2.6% to $1,229 per ounce, a nine-month high. Financial sentiment right now: A rumour is sweeping the trading floors that the Bank of Japan has intervened to weaken the yen, following today\u2019s surge against the US dollar. And the yen has weakened, moving from \u00a5111.5 to \u00a5112 against the $1. America is waking up to the news that Asian and European markets have taken another bath this morning. And they are next in line: Investors are ditching Portuguese government bonds this morning, as the financial turmoil grows. The wave of selling has driven up the yield on Portugal\u2019s 10-year bonds to 4.3%, up from 3.5% yesterday. That\u2019s a remarkable surge, meaning that prices have dropped sharply. It implies that the markets are losing confidence in Portugal again, demanding a higher rate of return for holding its bonds. Shorter-term Portuguese debt is also being hit. The move comes as Lisbon\u2019s new left-wing government begins to reverse some of its predecessor\u2019s austerity policies. Last week, the EU warned that Portugal was \u201cat risk\u201d of breaching Europe\u2019s fiscal rules, after warily approving its 2016 budget. Joshua Mahony, market analyst at IG, reckons fear is driving shares down today, rather than a fundamental shift. He says: The fear surrounding global financial markets has been cranked up further today, as risk assets once more took a battering in favour of defensive plays. The continued deterioration in the FTSE is as much to do with the ongoing fall in oil and the fall in the US dollar against the yen, as the outlook for the UK economy itself, yet with markets in freefall, who is going to argue with a trend? There are many potential causes of the current rout. For example: signs of slowing global growth; fears that negative interest rates severely undermine bank profitability; the bad loans lurking in the European financial sector; suspicions that China is much weaker than the GDP figures show.... All good reasons to worry. But as the Wall Street Journal\u2019s Juliet Samuel flags up, the City isn\u2019t sure what\u2019s really behind it. In a morning of wild and alarming moves, one stands out. The Japanese yen has jumped by 1.7% against the US dollar today, strengthening from \u00a5113.3 to $1, to \u00a5111.5. That\u2019s a chunky daily move. And so far this year, the yen has gained by 7.5% against the US dollar, hitting its strongest point since November 2014. That will surely concern the Bank of Japan, which imposed negative rates last month in its latest attempt to stimulate growth and inflation. A stronger yen is bad for exports, and also deflationary as it makes imported goods cheaper. Yann Quelenn, market analyst at Swissquote Bank, explains: The US dollar printed a fresh 16-month low against the Japanese yen, suggesting that traders believe the BoJ will be unable to further weaken the yen, while betting the Fed will remain sidelined for a longer period of time. But there is also chatter that the BoJ may have to intervene in the markets to weaken the yen. Here, courtesy of David Buik of Panmure Gordon, is a snapshot of the day\u2019s rout (so far) in the banking sector: Britain\u2019s borrowing costs have now hit their lowest level since the late 1600s, thanks to the plunge in bond yields today (details here). So reckons Sky News\u2019s economics editor, Ed Conway, who has checked the historic data. It\u2019s unlikely that Britain\u2019s medieval kings could have borrowed any cheaper either. They were notorious serial defaulters, due to the demands of court life and military ambitions. Mind you, academics at the University of Reading have argued that the picture was more nuanced.... They wrote: It can be difficult to identify medieval interest rates, in part because interest charges had to be disguised to circumvent the Church prohibition on usury, but we found that the king could borrow at 15% annualised interest when his finances were stable but that this could increase to more than 40% during periods of financial pressure, most notably during wartime. Edward I probably had a surplus on his account with the Ricciardi, who collapsed as the result of a \u2018credit crunch\u2019 caused by the unexpected outbreak of war between England and France..... More here: Credit Finance in the Middle Ages: loans to the English crown c.1272-1340 The Greek stock market is suffering another rout, led by its banks: Oil is being thumped by predictions of a growing crude glut, as the world economy slows. The price of US crude has fallen by almost 3% today, to $26.74 per barrel. That\u2019s a one-month low, but also close to the levels ploughed in 2003: Bloomberg\u2019s Caroline Hyde tweets the details: The refusal of oil producers to cut production is fuelling concerns that we may run out of places to put the stuff, as inventory levels keep rising. Jasper Lawler of CMC Markets explains: The threat of further rate hikes from the Fed coupled with diminished prospects for a joint production cut between OPEC and non-OPEC producers have sent US oil prices back down to 12-year lows. The renewed slump in the price of oil has been unfortunate timing for French oil giant Total to report a 20% rise in annual net profits which CEO Patrick Pouyanne proclaimed as the \u201cbest performance\u201d amongst the oil majors. Today\u2019s rout has driven European bank shares down to their lowest level in three and a half years. The Stoxx 600 Banks index, which includes the main lenders in Europe, has shed 6.1% and is now at its lowest level since August 2012. Summer 2012 was the point at which the eurozone debt crisis began to ease, with European Central Bank chief Mario Draghi vowing to do \u201cwhatever it takes\u201d to save the euro. Today\u2019s rout is being led by Italian banks, and French bank SocGen (after its results missed forecasts today). Britain\u2019s government borrowing costs have just hit an all-time low, according to Reuters data. The yield on 10-year UK gilts, which are the benchmark for UK borrowing, has fallen to 1.29% this morning in a wave of buying. Yield, the interest rate on the debt, fall when prices rise. So this implies Britain can borrow cheaper than at any time before (the data I can see goes back to 1989) That sounds like good news, except that it reflects wider fears over a global recession. If traders were upbeat about growth prospects, they\u2019d be buying shares instead. Investors are scrambling into \u201csafer\u201d eurozone government bonds. That\u2019s another sign that they\u2019re seeking protection against recession and market turmoil. German government bond yields (the interest rate on bunds) has hit a nine-month low this morning - meaning the prices of these bonds has hit the highest level since May 2015. And the yield on US 10-year Treasury bills has hit its lowest in three years, at just 1.62%. That also suggests traders are pessimistic about future growth and inflation prospects. Bank shares are getting a tonking this morning. Deutsche Bank, the source of so much worry, is down by 6.3% in Frankfurt, with Commerzbank close behind. After a rough start to trading, European stock markets are deep and turbulent sea of red. Italy is the worst performer, with its FTSE MIB index slumping by over 4%: FXTM Research Analyst Lukman Otunuga says Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen is partly to blame. He reckons investors are disappointed that Yellen didn\u2019t rule out interest rate rises, when she appeared at Congress yesterday: Although the economic environment has transformed for the worst since the start of the year with ongoing China woes and violent declines in oil prices exposing the US economy to downside risks, in defiance the Fed continues to hold the view of raising rates at a gradual pace. While Yellen also emphasized that financial conditions in the US have become less supportive of growth, this was counterbalanced with the impressive labour report which in the eyes of the Fed opened doors for a potential rate rise in March. Yellen will get a second bite at the cherry later today, when she continues testifying to US lawmakers. Wall Street is expected to take a tumble later today: Nour Al-Hammoury, chief market strategist at ADS Securities in Abu Dhabi says: Asia and Europe equities remain weak following the Feds acknowledgment that they have concerns over global markets. European financial risk indices continue to rise, which is keeping demand high for safe haven assets. Ahead of the open we\u2019re currently calling the DOW down 275 15640 and the S&amp;P down 32 at 1820 Sweden\u2019s central bank has cut the country\u2019s interest rates deeper into negative territory, in another sign of the turbulence in the financial world. The Riksbank has just announced that the headline rate will fall to -.50%, from -0.35%. The move is designed to drive inflation up and stimulate growth. The bank says: The economy continues to strengthen but inflation is expected to be lower during 2016 than previously forecast. The rate cut will also weaken the Swedish currency. It is already hitting the Swedish Krone hard, sending the euro surging against the krone. Only 3 economists surveyed by Bloomberg has expected such a deep cut (8 thought rates would stay at minus 0.35%, and 7 predicted a cut to minus 0.45%) Tony Cross, analyst at Trustnet Direct, says fears over the world economy are hitting shares hard, and also pushing the oil price down. Any hopes that yesterday\u2019s modest rally for the FTSE-100 would mark something of a turning point have been dashed. WTI crude oil prices tested territory below $27/barrel, whilst the return to work after the Lunar New Year break saw traders in Hong Kong lacked any signs of optimism. Janet Yellen\u2019s words yesterday have clearly done nothing to calm sentiment \u2013 yes the next US rate hike may have been pushed back, but the challenge now is managing the US recovery against a potential global slowdown. The London selloff is accelerating, wiping 130 points off the Footsie. The index of major blue-chip shares has now hit its lowest level since July 2012: Over in Paris, French bank Societe Generale has plunged by 9%. It missed City forecasts this morning, with net income coming in around 31% below analyst forecasts. SocGen also warned that \u201cheadwinds\u201d could hamper its efforts to hit profitability targets this year. That wipes out yesterday\u2019s recovery: Money is pouring into safer assets, and out of shares. The gold price has risen to $1,211 per ounce, its highest since May 2015. And the Japanese yen has hit its highest level against the British pound since November 2013. Down we go again! European shares are falling at the start of trading. The FTSE 100 has shed 101 points, or 1.7%, to 5,570 points. Germany\u2019s DAX has lost 1.5%, and the French CAC is off by 1.6% Most London shares are down, but mining stocks are leading the selloff reflecting ongoing gloom about the global economy. Rio Tinto has slumped by 6.7%, after it abandoned its \u201cprogressive dividend\u201d policy this morning (a promise to pay more shareholders in future years). This follows a late-selloff on Wall Street last night, and the slumps in Asia earlier today. Mike van Dulken of Accendo Markets says: The weakness stems from Fed chair Janet Yellen warning on current financial market turbulence and suggesting further rate hikes could be delayed, which added to already raised anxiety about the health of the global economy to hold back risk sentiment. It\u2019s never great returning to work after a holiday. But the mood in Hong Kong was particularly grim, as investors watched shares tumble. Nitin Dialdas, chief investment officer at Mandarin Capital in Hong Kong, told Reuters that 2016 will be tough. \u201dI think this is going to be a difficult year for investors and even a fledgling U.S. economic recovery looks to be snuffed out by global markets development.\u201d Charles Li, chief executive of the Hong Kong Stock exchange, was also gloomy: \u201cThere is very little good news and continuous bad news and this is a test of market confidence.\u201d Hong Kong\u2019s stock market is suffering its worst start to the Lunar New Year since 1994. A wave of selling has hit shares as traders return to their desks after this week\u2019s holiday. They were swift to catch up with the turmoil in European and US markets, with Asian markets having been shut since Friday. The Hang Seng index has lurched down, losing 795 points or nearly 4% to 18,535. That\u2019s its biggest one-day loss in six months. As this chart from Bloomberg shows, that\u2019s the worst start to a Lunar New Year in over two decades: There were similar losses in other Asian markets. South Korea\u2019s Kospi staged its biggest daily drop in nearly four years, down 2.9 percent to finish at 1,861.54. Shane Oliver, chief economist at AMP Capital in Sydney, blamed fears over the global slowdown, and the oil price slump, adding: \u201cWhat started in January as mainly China based worries has clearly broadened back out to concerns about global growth\u201d Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. There\u2019s no end in sight to the market turmoil. European stocks are expected to fall at the start of trading, with worries over the global slowdown centre-stage again. The futures market suggests the main indices, including London\u2019s FTSE 100, will lose around 1% at the opening - wiping out Wednesday\u2019s small rally. Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen is testifying to Congress for the second day running (at 3pm GMT). She\u2019ll probably repeat her concerns about the turmoil in the markets, which could prevent the Fed from hiking rates this year. We\u2019ll hear from another central bank today, too. At 8.30am, Sweden\u2019s Riksbank announces its monetary policy decision, and some economists believe it will cut interest rates deeper into negative territory. And Eurozone finance ministers are meeting in Brussels; Greece\u2019s struggling bailout talks will be on the agenda, as Athens and its creditors continue to argue over its austerity plan. In the corporate world. oil giant Total, holiday firm Thomas Cook, insurance group Zurich and mining giant Rio Tinto are all reporting results (more on them shortly....) We\u2019ll be tracking all the main events through the day...",

Analyst Connor Campbell at Spreadex said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Initially threatening a 300 point plunge when the bell rang on Wall Street the Dow Jones settled into a more solid, if still troublesome, 175 point drop as the open receded into the background. Whether or not the better than expected, and best since December, jobless claims helped (it probably didn\u2019t) is unclear, though at this point in time in the most worthless piece of positive news is likely appreciated by fear-stricken investors. The Dow was probably saved (and this is all relative, remember) by the fact that the blood loss endured by the US banking sector was nowhere near as gory as the scenes over in Europe, Bank of America the worst hit at around a 4% decline.</p> <p>In Europe things were much the same, i.e. not too good at all. The FTSE just about managed to claw its way back to the 5600 mark, arguably thanks to the fact that Brent Crude is now closer to $31 per barrel than it is to $30. The DAX, meanwhile, tucked under a 2% decline around 40 points away from 8900, whilst the CAC climbed down from its 3.7% nadir to post a 2.7% loss, both indices aided by a (minor) reduction in losses form Deutsche Bank and Societe Generale respectively.</p> <p>The big question now is, does today\u2019s horrorshow continue into Friday? Given just how fearful investors appear to be at the moment it is incredibly hard to tell; one thing tomorrow does have going for it, however, is data. Lots and lots of it. Germany, Italy and the Eurozone as a whole reveal their preliminary fourth quarter GDP figures, whilst the US sees retail sales, import prices and the University of Michigan consumer sentiment number. The markets will be hoping (nay, praying) that, with a bit of distraction (like on Wednesday), the week can end on a slightly more positive note.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-56bca05ee4b0e04c43d738da\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-02-11T15:04:41.284Z\">3.04pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen is back on Capitol Hill to discuss the global outlook and monetary policy with the Senate Banking Committee, the second and last day of her testimony to Congress.</p> <p>The hearing has begun and can be viewed <strong><a href=\"http://www.banking.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/hearings?ID=EBDD6E93-DC93-415D-99E1-0CD84FFA04D5\">here.</a></strong></p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-56bca29ce4b0d007e4723bc1\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-02-11T15:03:25.495Z\">3.03pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Elsewhere Morgan Stanley has agree to pay $3.2bn relating to the sale of mortgage-backed bonds before the financial crisis.</strong></p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-56bc9e8de4b0e04c43d738d7\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-02-11T14:46:04.557Z\">2.46pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Ahead of Yellen\u2019s testimony, some think it is time for a US rate cut:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/D_Blanchflower/status/697791707002220544\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Global demand collapsing stock markets tumbling &amp;

      "bodyText": "Four families of Americans killed by Mexican drug cartels are suing British banking giant HSBC for allegedly contributing to their deaths by allowing the gangs to launder billions of dollars. It is a fresh setback for the bank, whose operations in Mexico have been under scrutiny by US authorities for years. The bank processed at least $881m in cash for Mexico\u2019s Sinaloa cartel, regarded as the most powerful drug gang in the world, according to US authorities. The suit claims that HSBC \u201cknowingly provided continuous and systematic material support to the cartels and their acts of terrorism by laundering billions of dollars for them. As a proximate result of HSBC\u2019s material support to the Mexican drug cartels, numerous lives, including those of the Plaintiffs, have been destroyed\u201d. It was filed on Tuesday in a federal court in the Texas border city of Brownsville. Rob Sherman, an HSBC spokesman, said in a statement that the bank intends to \u201cvigorously\u201d defend itself against the claims and is \u201ccommitted to combating financial crime and [has] taken strict steps to help keep bad actors out of the global financial system\u201d. In 2012 a US Senate report described the bank as having a \u201cpervasively polluted\u201d culture that saw it allow drug kingpins, rogue nations and terrorists to move hundreds of millions of dollars around the financial system. US prosecutors said that deposits at Mexican branches were so frequent that drug traffickers used boxes that were designed to fit perfectly through the teller windows. HSBC apologised, pledged to reform its procedures and paid a $1.9bn settlement to US authorities. On Tuesday a judge in New York said he would probably delay the release of a report by a federal monitor appointed to examine the level of HSBC\u2019s compliance since that agreement. The lawsuit graphically details several murders at the hands of some of Mexico\u2019s most brutal cartels. In one incident, Lesley Redelfs, a US consulate employee in the Mexican border city of Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez, and her husband, Arthur, a detention officer in El Paso, Texas, were ambushed after leaving a children\u2019s birthday party in Ju\u00e1rez. Their SUV was sprayed with bullets and Lesley Redelfs, who was four months pregnant, was shot twice in the head. Her husband was gunned down as he tried to reach the border and their seven-month old daughter was found screaming in the back seat. Two months later, in May 2010, as Rafael Morales Valencia stepped outside a church after his wedding ceremony, assassins invaded the courtyard, forced the wedding party to the ground then kidnapped the groom, his uncle and his brother. They were transported to a safe house, tortured and asphyxiated by duct tape wrapped around their faces. \u201cDriven by its desire to expand its business and increase revenue, HSBC intentionally implemented criminally deficient anti-money laundering programs, processes and controls, which were designed to guarantee that billions of dollars would go through its banks undetected or unreported. And that is exactly what happened,\u201d the lawsuit alleges, claiming that due diligence processes at Mexican bank branches were non-existent or fabricated, allowing suspicious individuals to deposit hundreds of thousands or even millions of US dollars. The suit says that money laundering is essential to the cartels\u2019 prosperity because \u201cwithout the ability to place, layer, and integrate their illicit proceeds into the global financial network, the cartels\u2019 ability to corrupt law enforcement and public officials, and acquire personnel, weapons, ammunition, vehicles, planes, communication devices, raw materials for drug production, and all other instrumentalities essential to their operations would be substantially impeded\u201d. It describes the cartels\u2019 activities as \u201cterrorist acts\u201d in a bid to argue that HSBC is liable under the US Anti-Terrorism Act, which allows survivors of terrorist acts to demand damages from organisations that provide material support to terrorists. HSBC and several other banks are the subjects of a lawsuit from US soldiers accusing them of financing terrorists who attacked American troops in Iraq. Arab Bank, headquartered in Jordan, was successfully sued by US citizens who brought claims under the Anti-Terrorism Act. It was accused of facilitating Hamas attacks. However, unlike Hamas, the Mexican groups are not designated as terrorist organisations by the US State Department. A 2011 attempt by a Texas congressman to put the top cartels on the list faltered amid concerns it would damage America\u2019s relationship with Mexico and arguments that the groups do not fit the definition of terrorism as they are motivated by money rather than political ideology.",

      "body": "<p>Four families of Americans killed by Mexican drug cartels are suing British banking giant HSBC for allegedly contributing to their deaths by allowing the gangs to launder billions of dollars.</p> <p>It is a fresh setback for the bank, whose operations in Mexico have been under scrutiny by US authorities for years. The bank <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/dec/11/hsbc-fine-prosecution-money-laundering\">processed at least $881m in cash</a> for Mexico\u2019s Sinaloa cartel, regarded as the most powerful drug gang in the world, according to US authorities. </p> <p>The suit claims that HSBC \u201cknowingly provided continuous and systematic material support to the cartels and their acts of terrorism by laundering billions of dollars for them. As a proximate result of HSBC\u2019s material support to the Mexican drug cartels, numerous lives, including those of the Plaintiffs, have been destroyed\u201d.</p> <p>It was filed on Tuesday in a federal court in the Texas border city of Brownsville. Rob Sherman, an HSBC spokesman, said in a statement that the bank intends to \u201cvigorously\u201d defend itself against the claims and is \u201ccommitted to combating financial crime and [has] taken strict steps to help keep bad actors out of the global financial system\u201d.</p> <p>In 2012 a US Senate report described the bank as having a<a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/dec/11/hsbc-bank-us-money-laundering\"> \u201cpervasively polluted\u201d</a> culture that saw it allow drug kingpins, rogue nations and terrorists to move hundreds of millions of dollars around the financial system. US prosecutors said that deposits at Mexican branches were so frequent that drug traffickers used boxes that were designed to fit perfectly through the teller windows. HSBC apologised, pledged to reform its procedures and paid a $1.9bn settlement to US authorities. </p> <p>On Tuesday a judge in New York said he would probably delay the <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-hsbc-moneylaundering-idUSKCN0VI28H\">release of a report </a>by a federal monitor appointed to examine the level of HSBC\u2019s compliance since that agreement.</p> <p>The lawsuit graphically details several murders at the hands of some of Mexico\u2019s most brutal cartels.</p> <p>In one incident, Lesley Redelfs, a US consulate employee in the Mexican border city of Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez, and her husband, Arthur, a detention officer in El Paso, Texas, were ambushed after leaving a children\u2019s birthday party in Ju\u00e1rez. Their SUV was sprayed with bullets and Lesley Redelfs, who was four months pregnant, was shot twice in the head. Her husband was gunned down as he tried to reach the border and their seven-month old daughter was found screaming in the back seat.</p> <p>Two months later, in May 2010, as Rafael Morales Valencia stepped outside a church after his wedding ceremony, assassins invaded the courtyard, forced the wedding party to the ground then kidnapped the groom, his uncle and his brother. They were transported to a safe house, tortured and asphyxiated by duct tape wrapped around their faces.</p> <p>\u201cDriven by its desire to expand its business and increase revenue, HSBC intentionally implemented criminally deficient anti-money laundering programs, processes and controls, which were designed to guarantee that billions of dollars would go through its banks undetected or unreported. And that is exactly what happened,\u201d the lawsuit alleges, claiming that due diligence processes at Mexican bank branches were non-existent or fabricated, allowing suspicious individuals to deposit hundreds of thousands or even millions of US dollars.</p> <p>The suit says that money laundering is essential to the cartels\u2019 prosperity because \u201cwithout the ability to place, layer, and integrate their illicit proceeds into the global financial network, the cartels\u2019 ability to corrupt law enforcement and public officials, and acquire personnel, weapons, ammunition, vehicles, planes, communication devices, raw materials for drug production, and all other instrumentalities essential to their operations would be substantially impeded\u201d.</p> <p>It describes the cartels\u2019 activities as \u201cterrorist acts\u201d in a bid to argue that HSBC is liable under the US Anti-Terrorism Act, which allows survivors of terrorist acts to demand damages from organisations that provide material support to terrorists. HSBC and several other banks are the subjects of a lawsuit from US soldiers accusing them of financing terrorists who attacked American troops in Iraq.</p> <p>Arab Bank, headquartered in Jordan, was <a href=\"http://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-arab-bank-jo-settlement-hamas-idUKKCN0QJ21A20150814\">successfully sued</a> by US citizens who brought claims under the Anti-Terrorism Act. It was accused of facilitating Hamas attacks.</p> <p>However, unlike Hamas, the Mexican groups are not designated as terrorist organisations by the US State Department. A 2011 <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/22/us/22ttcartels.html\">attempt by a Texas congressman</a> to put the top cartels on the list faltered amid concerns it would damage America\u2019s relationship with Mexico and arguments that the groups do not fit the definition of terrorism as they are motivated by money rather than political ideology.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The former boss of Sainsbury\u2019s has waded into the row over the tax paid by multinationals such as Amazon and eBay, saying it was unfair that that traditional retailers must pay huge rates bills for services such as roads and waste collection, while their online rivals paid little but received the same benefits. Business rates, said Justin King, are a bigger problem for British retailers than the corporation tax scandal. Amazon and other US businesses including Starbucks, Google and eBay have been criticised for paying little corporation tax in the UK compared to the value of the business that they do. But for retailers, said King, corporation tax is vastly overshadowed by the huge difference in business rates between firms with chains of stores and online players with just a few big warehouses. \u201cBusiness rates are by far the most significant inbalance in the tax system,\u201d King said. \u201cBusiness rates for most retail businesses are a much more significant part of the tax burden than any other part of the tax system.\u201d He said the low level of business rates paid by online retailers in comparison to supermarkets and other major retail chains was accelerating change on Britain\u2019s high streets. Amazon, which raked in sales of more than \u00a36bn in sales from UK shoppers, is estimated to pay only about \u00a310m in business rates. Marks &amp; Spencer, which has UK sales of just less than \u00a310bn, last year faced a rates bill of \u00a3177m. Tesco\u2019s UK sales last year were nearly \u00a344bn, more than seven times those of Amazon, but its business rates bill is 60 times higher. Sainsbury\u2019s, Kings former employer, pays \u00a3480m in business rates. King said: \u201cA big part of of the advantage non bricks and mortar retailers enjoy is their ability to use services that their competitors paid for. They use the roads, they still use waste collection services but they are paid for by the local retailer, through business rates, who has just had that sale competed away from him. \u201cThat unbalance is a [big] part of the change we are seeing [on the high street] and clearly has to change at some point,\u201d added King, who now works for private equity firm Terra Firma, which owns Wyevale Garden Centres, Odeon cinemas and the Four Seasons care homes. He added: \u201cThe reality is it is an ever inflating figure paid by an ever decreasing number of people and you only have to draw lines forward to realise that at some point in time the government is going to have to plug that hole in the tax system. \u201d Retailers are becoming increasingly vocal in calling for a change to the rates system as they face increasing competition from online rivals such as Amazon. John Lewis boss Andy Street, Tesco\u2019s Dave Lewis and Mike Coupe, the current boss of Sainsbury\u2019s, have all said the system is putting unfair pressure on their businesses. Lewis said retailers face a \u201cpotentially lethal cocktail\u201d as profits come under pressure from increased competition but costs rise because of business rates and the national living wage. Paul Turner-Mitchell, a business rates campaigner who calculated Amazon\u2019s estimated business rates bill, said: \u201cRetail has evolved over recent years but the current business rate regime simply does not ebb and flow with economical or market place changes.\u201d David Cameron promised \u201cradical reform\u201d of the system, but a Treasury review has only pledged to look at the way the system is administered, not the total amount of tax taken. The complexity of the system could increase after chancellor George Osborne said that local councils could be allowed to retain the amount they raise from business rates and set special rates for certain areas. The outcome of the review is expected to be announced with the budget next month.

      "bodyText": "Bang, there goes another fat FTSE 100 dividend. Rio Tinto is scrapping its \u201cprogressive\u201d dividend policy, pausing only to let down its income-hungry shareholders gently. The dividend for 2015 will be the same as for 2014 \u2013 $2.15 a share. The shock will come in 2016\u2019s payment \u2013 \u201cnot less than 110 cents.\u201d And, by 2017, anything is possible: the board will form a view at the time, taking account of all relevant factors, blah, blah. Once upon a time, a Rio chief executive could expect to be fired for breaking the unwritten rule that a big miner\u2019s dividend should only ever increase. That is not going to happen to Sam Walsh. First, Rio has been a relative outperformer in the current downturn. Unlike his predecessor, Tom Albanese, Walsh hasn\u2019t bet the balance sheet on a ruinous aluminium deal at the top of market, or taken a flutter on unproductive coal mines in Mozambique. Instead, he has tried to restore Rio\u2019s reputation for being boring and conservative. A net loss of $866m for 2015 isn\u2019t exactly boring \u2013 and nor is the 51% plunge in underlying earnings to $4.54bn \u2013 but Rio is in better shape than its London-listed brethren. Anglo American and Glencore have scrapped dividends altogether. BHP Billiton will surely have to cut soon, and should have moved immediately after the Samarco dam disaster in Brazil last November. The second reason is that upward-only dividends were always a silly idea for miners. This is a feast-or-famine business in which iron ore can fetch $150-a-tonne one year and $40 the next. Smooth dividend progression and a volatile pricing climate don\u2019t sit easily together. Worse, the combination can mess up more important decisions, like when to cut or increase capital expenditure. Rio\u2019s new plan is for cash returns to shareholders to be 40%-60% of earnings, which is vague but sensible. At least shareholders will know payments will always be made from earned profits. The UK\u2019s twin oil giants \u2013 BP and Shell \u2013 still see life differently and are desperately trying to cling to their dividends out of loyalty to shareholders. They can probably manage the trick for another year, but if the oil price is still sub-$40 this time next year they will have to bow to the inevitable. They will thank Walsh for breaking the taboo. Tax sideshow Fancy that, Google\u2019s decision to base its European headquarters in Dublin had little to do with the low-tax advantages offered by Ireland. That was merely \u201cone of the factors\u201d. The stuff that really appealed was the multilingual locals \u2013 \u201c40 different languages,\u201d cooed Google\u2019s Matt Brittin \u2013 plus the low property costs and fast internet connections to the US. Dublin is a great city, but, come on, if Brittin is seriously expecting us to swallow the line that tax was a minor consideration, he\u2019s deaf to the public anger in the UK. We\u2019d love to see the internal memo that describes Ireland\u2019s corporation tax rate of 12.5% \u2013 plus the country\u2019s willingness to tolerate arrangements such as the \u201cdouble Irish\u201d to facilitate tax-efficient transfers to Bermuda \u2013 as an incidental perk. On the contrary, the Irish base seems to be essential to Google\u2019s international structure. It is also, as everybody knows by now, the structure that allows \u00a35bn of revenue from UK advertisers to be booked in Ireland. The revenues that flow to the UK are a fraction of that size and are fees paid by Google Ireland for services supplied by the UK unit, a set-up that looks back-to-front even if it has received a thumbs-up from HMRC. What was needed from the MPs on the public accounts committee was an examination of how far Google has stretched the definition of where economic activity takes place. Sadly, they barely scratched the surface. Too much time was lost in the noise of MPs demanding to be told figures they could have looked up themselves beforehand in Google\u2019s accounts. Let\u2019s hope the Treasury select committee does better with its \u201cshifting sands\u201d inquiry into the erosion of the UK\u2019s tax base. Committee chairman Andrew Tyrie, when running the parliamentary commission on banking standards, sometimes employed a well-briefed QC to probe important technical points. The tactic worked well. It would have improved the limp PAC session. Thaw at HSBC HSBC\u2019s top brass should have spent less time pondering where to put the headquarters and more time listening to their staff. A fortnight after announcing a wage freeze, chief executive Stuart Gulliver has had to unfreeze. There was rebellion in the ranks. He should not be surprised. Despite HSBC\u2019s many recent woes, Gulliver collected \u00a330m in his first four years as boss. That is a poor position from which to tell branch workers to tighten their belts.",

This is a feast-or-famine business in which iron ore can fetch $150-a-tonne one year and $40 the next. Smooth dividend progression and a volatile pricing climate don\u2019t sit easily together. Worse, the combination can mess up more important decisions, like when to cut or increase capital expenditure. Rio\u2019s new plan is for cash returns to shareholders to be 40%-60% of earnings, which is vague but sensible. At least shareholders will know payments will always be made from earned profits.</p> <p>The UK\u2019s twin oil giants \u2013 BP and Shell \u2013 still see life differently and are desperately trying to cling to their dividends out of loyalty to shareholders. They can probably manage the trick for another year, but if the oil price is still sub-$40 this time next year they will have to bow to the inevitable. They will thank Walsh for breaking the taboo.</p> <h2>Tax sideshow</h2> <p>Fancy that, Google\u2019s decision to base its European headquarters in Dublin had little to do with the low-tax advantages offered by Ireland. That was merely \u201cone of the factors\u201d. The stuff that really appealed was the multilingual locals \u2013 \u201c40 different languages,\u201d <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/feb/11/google-matt-brittin-salary-public-accounts-committee-tax-deal-grilling\">cooed Google\u2019s Matt Brittin</a> \u2013 plus the low property costs and fast internet connections to the US.</p> <p>Dublin is a great city, but, come on, if Brittin is seriously expecting us to swallow the line that tax was a minor consideration, he\u2019s deaf to the public anger in the UK. We\u2019d love to see the internal memo that describes Ireland\u2019s corporation tax rate of 12.5% \u2013 plus the country\u2019s willingness to tolerate arrangements such as the \u201cdouble Irish\u201d to facilitate tax-efficient transfers to Bermuda \u2013 as an incidental perk. On the contrary, the Irish base seems to be essential to Google\u2019s international structure.</p> <p>It is also, as everybody knows by now, the structure that allows \u00a35bn of revenue from UK advertisers to be booked in Ireland. The revenues that flow to the UK are a fraction of that size and are fees paid by Google Ireland for services supplied by the UK unit, a set-up that looks back-to-front even if it has received a thumbs-up from HMRC.</p> <p>What was needed from the MPs on the public accounts committee was an examination of how far Google has stretched the definition of where economic activity takes place. Sadly, they barely scratched the surface. Too much time was lost in the noise of MPs demanding to be told figures they could have looked up themselves beforehand in Google\u2019s accounts.</p> <p>Let\u2019s hope the Treasury select committee does better with its \u201cshifting sands\u201d inquiry into the erosion of the UK\u2019s tax base. Committee chairman Andrew Tyrie, when running the parliamentary commission on banking standards, sometimes employed a well-briefed QC to probe important technical points. The tactic worked well. It would have improved the limp PAC session.</p> <h2>Thaw at HSBC</h2> <p>HSBC\u2019s top brass should have spent less time pondering where to put the headquarters and more time listening to their staff. A fortnight after announcing a wage freeze, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/feb/11/hsbc-axes-2016-pay-freeze-after-staff-protests\">chief executive Stuart Gulliver has had to unfreeze</a>. There was rebellion in the ranks. He should not be surprised. Despite HSBC\u2019s many recent woes, Gulliver collected \u00a330m in his first four years as boss. That is a poor position from which to tell branch workers to tighten their belts.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Panicked investors sought refuge in the safe havens of gold and government bonds on Thursday as a fresh spasm of global selling sent share prices crashing in Asia, Europe and North America. Banks and companies exposed to lower commodity prices were among the biggest losers in London, where the FTSE 100 Index fell by 135 points, a drop of more than 2%. An index of Britain\u2019s banks fell to levels not seen since the depths of the post-Lehman Brothers recession in early 2009. London\u2019s fall, which wiped \u00a335bn off the value of the FTSE 100, was part of a global rout that began in Tokyo, spread to the major bourses of Europe and then to Wall Street, further unsettled by another drop in oil prices and news of a regulatory investigation into the affairs of aircraft manufacturer Boeing. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 255 points, or 1.6%, to 15,660. The S&amp;P 500 fell 1.2% and the Nasdaq Composite lost 0.4%. All three had bounced back late in the day from sharper falls but, again, financial stocks were big losers. Financial shares in the S&amp;P have lost roughly 18% so far this year. Janet Yellen, the chair of the Federal Reserve, did little to lift spirits when she said that negative interest rates were \u201cnot off the table\u201d. Until this week, investors had assumed that the US central bank would raise borrowing costs steadily this year after moving for the first time in almost a decade in December. The International Monetary Fund said it was concerned about the recent sharp declines in the share prices of European banks, because a healthy banking sector was needed to underpin economic growth. The interest rate \u2013 or yield \u2013 on a 10-year UK government gilt declined to below 1.3% at one stage, a record low, as investors anticipated a prolonged period of sluggish growth, weak inflation and low interest rates. Investors fear that although banks have bolstered their capital positions since the last crisis, they will start to report losses on non-performing loans to energy and property companies affected by faltering growth, while their profitability will also be hit by negative interest rates. HSBC shares closed at their lowest level since the spring of 2009, when the global recession bottomed out. The three biggest fallers on the FTSE 100 were all financial institutions \u2013 the Prudential, Aberdeen Asset Management and Barclays \u2013 which were all 7% lower. But their losses were eclipsed by French bank Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale, which lost 13% of its value after admitting that \u201cheadwinds\u201d could knock its profits this year. On a day of dramatic market moves: Sweden\u2019s central bank pushed its interest rate further into negative territory, taking it to minus 0.50% from minus 0.35% \u201cUncertainty regarding global developments is still high, with low inflation and several central banks pursuing more expansionary monetary policy,\u201d the Riksbank said. Deutsche Bank, a major focus of the market\u2019s concerns, resumed a slide which had temporarily paused on Wednesday and closed 6% lower, while shares in Credit Suisse fell to levels last seen in 1989. Gold hit a year high of about $1,235 an ounce. Oil prices fell in New York by 4% to $26.34 a barrel, the lowest level in 13 years. Eurozone finance ministers tried to soothe concerns with Finland\u2019s Alex Stubb saying \u201cwe should be pretty relaxed\u201d about the volatility in bank shares. Stock markets across Europe all closed down: the CAC in France dropped 4%; Germany\u2019s DAX lost 3%; the Italian MIB fell by 5.5%. Asia set the tone for trading early in the day. With the Chinese stock market still closed for the holiday, Hong Kong dropped 4% while the Japanese yen continued to rise against the dollar, sparking rumours that the central bank had intervened in the market. Steen Jakobsen, chief economist at Saxo Bank, said: \u201cThis week may go down in financial history as the week when central bank planning died \u2013 the 2016 version of the fall of the Berlin Wall.\u201d With much of the focus on the banking sector, Sir Jon Cunliffe, one of the deputy governors of the Bank of England, said that \u201cwe are not there yet\u201d in being able to deal with the collapse of any international bank. The scale of the problems have left investors groping for reasons for the loss of confidence that has plagued the markets since the start of 2016, giving them the worst start to the year on record. While some have blamed fears of sluggish economic growth and worries about the impact of prolonged low interest rates on banks and other sectors, some investors are looking at other factors. Saker Nusseibeh, chief executive of Hermes Investment Management, said: \u201cThere is no fundamental reason for the market to be in this state \u2026 We think it\u2019s because the market is dominated by people who do not invest on fundamental factors.\u201d The use of financial instruments that track markets, such as exchange traded funds and commodity trading advisors, was part of the reason for the phenomenon, he said. \u201cIt is creating a situation where the market is separated from reality \u2026 It\u2019s Alice in Wonderland. They are turning stock markets into casinos.\u201d Economists warned that the falls in stock markets could indicate a downturn for economies. \u201cOver recent years, equity prices have been a fairly reliable and timely guide to the performance of the real economy,\u201d said experts at Capital Economics. \u201cOn past form, the declines in eurozone equities over the past year look consistent with annual contractions in GDP of more than 1%.\u201d They said they did not expect the eurozone to contract this year but warned: \u201cWe estimate that the decline in equity prices this year has knocked almost \u20ac300bn, or 1.5%, off household financial wealth, which could have a large impact on consumer spending.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The government has appointed a Facebook director and the former head of Amazon UK to a new advisory committee on the digital economy, despite the ongoing row over the amounts such companies have paid in tax to the UK exchequer. The appointments come days after it emerged that the Department for Work and Pensions plans to give a non-executive directorship to Amazon\u2019s boss in China, Doug Gurr. Minister for the Cabinet Office Matt Hancock said he had appointed Facebook\u2019s Richard Allan, the director of policy, Europe, to a new advisory board that will help shape the government\u2019s digital services. In October last year it emerged that Facebook paid just \u00a34,327 in corporation tax in the UK. Its revenues in the UK were \u00a3105m last year but the company declared an operating loss of \u00a328.5m. Hancock has also appointed Brian McBride, Amazon\u2019s former UK managing director, to the group, which will be called the Government Digital Services advisory board. McBride is now chairman of the online fashion retailer, ASOS. The group will meet on a quarterly basis to support, advise and challenge the government to deliver better services for users and evaluate how emerging digital and technology trends can be applied to public services. The group also includes the founder and CEO of LoveFilm, Saul Klein. LoveFilm is owned by Amazon. In addition, Brent Hoberman and Baroness Lane-Fox, the founders of Lastminute.com are also members of the group. Hoberman is also a director of Guardian Media Group. Hancock has also appointed Herman Narula to the group. Narula is the chief executive of Improbable, a London-based developer of SpatialOS, an operating system for building virtual worlds and simulations recently backed by the Silicon Valley venture fund, Andreessen Horowitz. Hancock said: \u201cI\u2019m thrilled to have these experts on board and look forward to working closely with them to discover and build the new digital infrastructure.\u201d Although many see the value of the government co-opting business leaders to advise it on policy, there are growing fears that largely US-based technology companies are having an increasing influence at a time when there is growing public pressure for them to pay more tax in the UK. Gurr\u2019s appointment was condemned by veteran tax campaigner Margaret Hodge who said: \u201cIf people are not putting their proper share into the pot, how can government ever justify giving them prestigious positions?\u201d Amazon\u2019s UK business paid just \u00a311.9m in tax in 2014, even though its Luxembourg unit took \u00a35.3bn from internet sales in the UK.",

      "bodyText": "British Gas and France\u2019s EDF have cut their gas prices by \u00a331 a year. They are the last of the UK\u2019s big six energy companies to reduce tariffs after a collapse in wholesale commodity costs. But consumer experts described the reductions as \u201cpaltry\u201d. They highlighted the fact that the reductions only kick in next month, at the end of the winter, and that electricity tariffs had been left unchanged. The price cut from British Gas, owned by Centrica, takes effect on 16 March, bringing 6.8 million customers an average saving of \u00a331. The cut will not apply to older fixed tariffs that are no longer on sale, but the firm said customers can switch without charge to one of the current tariffs. EDF is to cut its gas prices by 5% from 24 March, which will mean a \u00a331 saving for 900,000 customers. The other big energy companies \u2013 E.ON, SSE, Scottish Power and npower \u2013 have also cut tariffs in recent weeks by just over 5%. Amber Rudd, the energy secretary, said: \u201cOn behalf of the families and businesses paying the bills, I\u2019ve spoken to bosses at the big six recently to make crystal clear that the government expects suppliers to pass on cost reductions to consumers. Six major suppliers have now announced cuts in their tariffs \u2013 it\u2019s a good start but there\u2019s more to do. \u201cThat\u2019s why it\u2019s right that the CMA [Competition and Markets Authority] is investigating to make sure that consumers are getting a fair deal, not a rough deal, on their energy. We continue to watch suppliers like a hawk.\u201d The CMA is investigating the energy market but has delayed its provisional report on remedies to March. Martin Lewis of MoneySavingExpert.com said the price cuts gave people the \u201cfalse sense of security that they\u2019re getting a reasonable deal, yet these amounts are paltry and trivial \u2013 a reduction of about \u00a330 on the typical bill, nothing close to the drop in wholesale prices\u201d. The Citizens Advice chief executive, Gillian Guy, said: \u201cFor too long, people have been missing out on the benefits of falling wholesale prices. The price cuts announced by British Gas and EDF Energy will help to bring people\u2019s bills down, but they will have to wait until March before it comes into effect.\u201d Ofgem, the energy regulator, advised households to save even more money by switching. Rachel Fletcher, Ofgem\u2019s senior partner for consumers and competition, said: \u201cThese price cuts are a movement in the right direction for loyal customers, but they are dwarfed by the savings available by switching from a standard tariff to a fixed deal. You could save more money, up to \u00a3300, faster by switching.\u201d Mark Todd, the co-founder of price comparison site energyhelpline, said 3 million customers a year are ditching expensive standard tariffs and moving to lower-cost fixed rates, and 1.5 million a year are leaving the big six and moving to smaller suppliers. \u201cConsumers must be aware these price cuts are to very expensive tariffs that are best avoided. Consumers can get much, much bigger price cuts by switching with a price comparison service \u2013 typically \u00a3300 a year,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s still no movement on electricity, despite 35% falls in wholesale electricity prices, which is extremely disappointing and means these are only really half price cuts.\u201d Last year, the Treasury said it planned an investigation into whether companies were passing on the benefits of lower wholesale prices to customers. It then conducted internal studies to examine how far and how quickly the benefits of oil price falls were feeding through to consumers. B\u00e9atrice Bigois, the managing director of customers at EDF Energy, defended the company\u2019s pricing policy, saying: \u201cThere are other costs impacting customers\u2019 energy bills that are beyond our control \u2013 these increased steadily during 2015.\u201d British Gas said the average annual gas bill would be almost \u00a3100 lower than 13 months ago. It said it was the only major supplier to reduce gas prices three times since the start of 2015, resulting in an overall reduction of 14%. Mark Hodges, the firm\u2019s head of energy supply and services in the UK and Ireland, said: \u201cCompetitive pricing is the way to retain existing customers and win new business in this hard-fought market.\u201d",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The Dublin-based banana company Fyffes has been accused of having \u201cno respect\u201d for workers\u2019 rights, amid allegations that staff on Central American fruit plantations are being serially mistreated. The GMB trade union called for Fyffes to be thrown out of the Ethical Trade Initiative, which promotes labour rights, over reports of abuses by subsidiaries in Costa Rica and Honduras. In one case, 14 workers on a melon plantation, which is 60%-owned by Fyffes\u2019 subsidiary Suragroh were allegedly hospitalised after being poisoned by noxious chemicals. The GMB said the female workers had not been given safety gear to protect them while handling fruit. It said workers had also reported that they were not being paid the minimum wage, were denied extra pay for overtime and Sundays and were not given public holidays. The GMB, which received the allegations from local trade union partners, said workers were also illegally charged for transport to the fields where they work. When they tried to form a trade union branch in January 2016, the GMB said, four members were abducted, threatened and held for 24 hours until they renounced membership. In Costa Rica, Fyffes\u2019 Anexco pineapple subsidiary was accused of running \u201ca purge\u201d of union members, which led to 12 workers taking the company to court. GMB\u2019s international officer Bert Schouwenburg, said: \u201cFyffes is an appalling employer that cares nothing for its workers who toil in boiling heat to produce the fruit that makes the company\u2019s profit. \u201cThey have no respect for domestic or international law governing workers\u2019 rights and must be brought to book.\u201d The GMB called for Fyffes, the world\u2019s fourth-largest banana importer, to be immediately expelled from the ETI, an organisation of companies, NGOs and unions backed by UK taxpayers. Fyffes, which has been importing bananas to the UK and Ireland since the 1880s, declined to comment on the allegations, which are as yet unsubstantiated. The Irish firm is part of the Ethical Trade Initiative (ETI), whose members sign up to a code that includes rules about how they treat workers. The ETI\u2019s website says it \u201creserves the right to terminate membership in cases where companies are in breach of ETI membership obligations\u201d. Peter McAllister, the ETI\u2019s executive director said: \u201cWe take all allegations very seriously. When issues are raised and there are local processes in place such as mediation and negotiation agreements, members are expected to work together and use those processes to get resolution. \u201cWe understand that there are local processes in place in this case.\u201d He said the ETI could investigate if the matter could not be resolved locally between Fyffes and unions, and a complaint was raised by one of its members. Banana Link, an ETI member and NGO that advocates for fruit workers\u2019 rights, said: \u201cWe absolutely hear the frustration from unions on the ground. We\u2019re keen to engage in dialogue with Fyffes in the hope that they\u2019ll speak to unions on the ground.\u201d Banana Link claims that only 4p in every \u00a31 spent on Costa Rican pineapples in the UK goes to workers. Fyffes\u2019 website says the company \u201chas a responsible attitude towards the environment, our growers, our customers and the consumer and we\u2019re proud of our corporate social responsibility and sustainability profiles \u201cFyffes prefers to work with people at source in order to maximise the benefit, evaluating the success of our participation in terms of observable results rather than potential media advantage.\u201d",

It said workers had also reported that they were not being paid the minimum wage, were denied extra pay for overtime and Sundays and were not given public holidays.</p> <p>The GMB, which received the allegations from local trade union partners, said workers were also illegally charged for transport to the fields where they work.</p> <p>When they tried to form a trade union branch in January 2016, the GMB said, four members were abducted, threatened and held for 24 hours until they renounced membership.</p> <p>In Costa Rica, Fyffes\u2019 Anexco pineapple subsidiary was accused of running \u201ca purge\u201d of union members, which led to 12 workers taking the company to court.</p> <p>GMB\u2019s international officer Bert Schouwenburg, said: \u201cFyffes is an appalling employer that cares nothing for its workers who toil in boiling heat to produce the fruit that makes the company\u2019s profit.</p> <p>\u201cThey have no respect for domestic or international law governing workers\u2019 rights and must be brought to book.\u201d</p> <p>The GMB called for Fyffes, the world\u2019s fourth-largest banana importer, to be immediately expelled from the ETI, an organisation of companies, NGOs and unions backed by UK taxpayers.</p> <p>Fyffes, which has been importing bananas to the UK and Ireland since the 1880s, declined to comment on the allegations, which are as yet unsubstantiated.</p> <p>The Irish firm is part of the Ethical Trade Initiative (ETI), whose members sign up to a code that includes rules about how they treat workers.</p> <p>The ETI\u2019s website says it \u201creserves the right to terminate membership in cases where companies are in breach of ETI membership obligations\u201d.</p> <p>Peter McAllister, the ETI\u2019s executive director said: \u201cWe take all allegations very seriously. When issues are raised and there are local processes in place such as mediation and negotiation agreements, members are expected to work together and use those processes to get resolution.</p> <p>\u201cWe understand that there are local processes in place in this case.\u201d</p> <p>He said the ETI could investigate if the matter could not be resolved locally between Fyffes and unions, and a complaint was raised by one of its members.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.bananalink.org.uk/\">Banana Link</a>, an ETI member and NGO that advocates for fruit workers\u2019 rights, said: \u201cWe absolutely hear the frustration from unions on the ground. We\u2019re keen to engage in dialogue with Fyffes in the hope that they\u2019ll speak to unions on the ground.\u201d</p> <p>Banana Link claims that only 4p in every \u00a31 spent on Costa Rican pineapples in the UK goes to workers.</p> <p>Fyffes\u2019 website </p> <p> says the company \u201chas a responsible attitude towards the environment, our growers, our customers and the consumer and we\u2019re proud of our corporate social responsibility and sustainability profiles</p> <p>\u201cFyffes prefers to work with people at source in order to maximise the benefit, evaluating the success of our participation in terms of observable results rather than potential media advantage.\u201d</p>",

As share prices plunged the yield on 10-year UK government gilts fell to levels never seen before. Should he wish to do so, George Osborne could borrow money in the markets more cheaply than any of his predecessors: neither Benjamin Disraeli nor William Gladstone (a particular hero of the chancellor) enjoyed interest rates as low as 1.29%. Osborne will regard record-low gilt yields as evidence that investors have confidence in the handling of the public finances \u2013 which up to a point is correct but hardly qualifies as the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth. It is certainly the case that low interest rates on gilts are in contrast to rising yields in some of the countries on the periphery of the eurozone, such as Greece and Portugal. But UK bond yields are not that much lower than those in Spain and Portugal, which hit 7% during the worst of the eurozone crisis in 2012. If Britain really was considered a safe haven in times of trouble, sterling would be going up on the foreign exchanges rather than falling against the dollar, euro and yen. There would also be much stronger bids for gilts in the auctions conducted by the government than appears to be the case now. The real reason that gilt yields are so low is that the date for an increase in UK interest rates from the Bank of England has receded so far into the distance that it would take the Hubble telescope to pinpoint it. Gilt yields tend to go up when rising inflationary pressure leads to investors becoming fearful of the Bank of England pushing up interest rates. Inflation is currently 0.2% and its expected rise over the coming months will be checked by the turmoil in the markets, itself a reflection of weakening global growth prospects. Surprisingly few eyebrows were raised when the Economist Intelligence Unit predicted that there would be no increase in interest rates until 2020, the year of the next general election. Indeed, the idea that the Bank\u2019s next move could be to provide more stimulus \u2013 either through a cut in interest rates or via an expansion of its quantitative easing programme \u2013 is quietly gaining traction. Threadneedle Street believes the UK banks and building societies could cope with a cut in interest rates from 0.5%; it also believes that previous dollops of QE boosted both activity and inflation. An alternative way of achieving the same result would be for Osborne to announce in his budget that he was embarking on a programme to improve Britain\u2019s public infrastructure. He would, of course, have to borrow money (and swallow a large dish of humble pie) to do so. But by continuing to rely on monetary policy alone he could be missing out on a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.",

      "bodyText": "Sainsbury\u2019s has become the first of the major supermarkets to commit to phasing out controversial multi-buy deals in favour of lower everyday prices after mounting evidence that shoppers find them confusing and misleading. Britain\u2019s second largest supermarket is to end the vast majority of so-called \u201cbuy one, get one free\u201d (bogof) and other deals on hundreds of products by August because customers have found they waste food and drink after being encouraged to buy more than they need. \u201cCustomer shopping habits have changed significantly in recent years, with people shopping more frequently, often seeking to buy what they need at that moment,\u201d said Sainsbury\u2019s food commercial director Paul Mills-Hicks. \u201cOur customers have told us that multi-buy promotions don\u2019t meet their shopping needs today, are often confusing and create challenges at home in terms of storage and waste.\u201d The announcement comes as the government\u2019s competition watchdog prepares to issue a new pricing rulebook to retailers by Easter, designed to ensure shoppers are not misled. It also follows the publication of a survey this week revealing that supermarket shoppers seduced by bogof deals and other special offers pay at least \u00a31,000 more a year on average than they planned. The government-backed Money Advice Service found that 76% of people regularly spent more than they intended to with an average overspend of \u00a311.14 per shopping trip. As the average shopper visits the supermarket 2.2 times a week, this adds up to \u00a31,274 per year more. After years of complex promotions, reward and loyalty cards and ill-fated price matching schemes that have failed to arrest tumbling profits, the move by Sainsbury\u2019s could mark a decisive shift in Britain\u2019s hard-fought supermarket price war. Other retailers are also simplifying their pricing, bringing them closer in line with the German discounters Aldi and Lidl, which have used limited product ranges, quality and simple low prices to lure customers away from their mainstream rivals. Earlier this month, Morrisons said it was slashing the price of more than 1,000 popular products in an attempt to stop shoppers deserting to Aldi and Lidl. Lidl said: \u201cOur unique business model means that we are able to offer our customers the lowest possible prices without compromising on the quality of our products.\u201d Aldi said: \u201cIn our view, complicated promotions, multibuy offers and price matching schemes are confusing, are not transparent and do not serve the best interests of consumers. We focus on providing quality products at transparent everyday low prices that consumers can easily understand.\u201d The UK\u2019s largest retailer, Tesco, said it was not phasing out multi-buy promotions but had cut the prices on more than 1,000 products and kept prices more stable over the past year. \u201cWe have been reducing the number of short-term promotions to focus on transparent, simple, consistently low prices on everyday products that matter most to customers, including on fresh meat, fish, fruit, and vegetables,\u201d Tesco said. It also axed many half-price promotions in the wine aisle, promising instead to simply keep prices low. Asda has long promoted its \u201ceveryday low prices\u201d with chief executive Andy Clarke warning against the \u201cpanic\u2019\u201d promotional tactics of the chain\u2019s rivals. Asda said: \u201cWe have always prioritised low prices over promotions, but we also understand that it\u2019s about getting the right balance for customers. This week alone, we\u2019ve removed 133 multi-buys in favour of everyday low prices and we have never used bogofs.\u201d Sainsbury\u2019s said its customers had responded positively after it removed more than half the multi-buy promotions on its grocery products. From March, it will scrap multi-buys from all soft and fizzy drinks, confectionery, biscuits and crisps. Supermarket pricing tactics have been under scrutiny by the government\u2019s competition watchdog in response to a \u201csuper-complaint\u201d lodged by the consumer group Which? last April. It submitted a dossier setting out details of \u201cdodgy multi-buys, shrinking products and baffling sales offers\u201d, claiming retailers were creating the illusion of savings, with 40% of groceries sold on promotion. Following a three-month inquiry, a report from the Competition and Markets Authority last July warned of \u201cpoor practice that could confuse or mislead shoppers\u201d. It is finalising its new binding guidelines to ensure price cuts and deals are presented in a way that does not mislead shoppers. The authority will not ban multi-buy promotions and deals, but will commit retailers to the new rules. Sainsbury\u2019s said \u201cthe vast majority\u201d of its multi-buy promotions would be phased out across the grocery business in-store and online by August 2016, with a few exceptions where multi-buy promotions will be used at certain times of the year. Jane Ellison, the public health minister, said: \u201cWe need to make the healthy choice the easy choice and it is good to see a leading supermarket like Sainsbury\u2019s responding as customers become more health-conscious. As part of our childhood obesity strategy we will be looking at more ways in which we can support people to live healthier lives.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Morgan Stanley will pay $3.2bn to settle federal and state charges that it misled investors in residential mortgage-backed securities during the financial crisis, New York\u2019s attorney general announced on Thursday. The deal comes a month after Goldman Sachs agreed to pay $5.06bn to resolve civil claims related to the firm\u2019s securitization, underwriting and sale of residential mortgage-backed securities from 2005 to 2007. The Goldman Sachs settlement included $875m in cash payments and $1.8bn in consumer relief. Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley are two of the last big banks to pay up for their role in the 2008 economic crisis. Bank of America agreed to pay the largest of the settlements, at $16.6bn, in 2014. A year prior, JPMorgan Chase paid about $13bn. \u201cToday\u2019s agreement is another victory in our efforts to help New Yorkers rebuild in the wake of the financial devastation caused by major banks,\u201d said attorney general Eric Schneiderman. \u201cToday\u2019s settlement will deliver resources to the families and communities that need them the most, while helping New Yorkers avoid foreclosure, and spurring the construction of more affordable housing units statewide.\u201d Schneiderman said the resolution would require Morgan Stanley to provide significant relief to New Yorkers, including loan reductions to help residents avoid foreclosure, and funds to spur the construction of more affordable housing. New York will receive $550m of the $3.2bn settlement- $400m worth of consumer relief and $150m in cash. The Department of Justice also announced on Wednesday its $2.6bn portion of the settlement. As part of the DOJ settlement agreement, Morgan Stanley acknowledged in writing that it failed to disclose critical information to prospective investors about the quality of the mortgage loans underlying its residential mortgage-backed securities and about its due diligence practices. On Thursday, Morgan Stanley stock was down almost 40% over the last three months. In January, the Wall Street bank reported a fourth quarter net revenue of $7.7bn, exceeding expectation. Its earnings were $753m, compared to a loss of $1.75bn the year before. \u201cWe are pleased to have finalized these settlements involving legacy residential mortgage-backed securities matters. The firm has previously reserved for all amounts related to these settlements,\u201d Mark Lake, a Morgan Stanley spokesman, said in a statement. During the press conference announcing the settlement, Schneiderman implied that there might be more settlements in the works. The settlements with the banks have stemmed from investigations by the residential mortgage-backed securities group, a joint federal and state task force. \u201cThe focus of our working group continues to be investigating and pursuing financial institutions that contributed to the crash and working as smartly as we can and try and see that the resources are directed from those institutions to help the people who are still suffering,\u201d he said. \u201cOur work is far from done.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Staff protests have forced HSBC to abandon a pay freeze imposed on staff less than two weeks ago, even though its chief executive has warned of the \u201cvery challenging operating environment\u201d this year. In an email to the bank\u2019s 250,000 staff, Stuart Gulliver revealed that complaints about the way the pay freeze had been announced had forced him into the U-turn. He said the bank would use cash set aside to pay bonuses to allow the pay rises to take place. \u201cThese pay rises will be funded from the 2016 variable bonus pool (for bonuses to be paid in 2017), the total quantum of which will be determined by our 2016 performance,\u201d Gulliver said. \u201cTo be clear the 2015 variable bonus payments to be paid in 2016 will not be affected by this action.\u201d HSBC\u2019s shares were down 4% in early trading on Thursday, hitting their lowest levels since April 2009 as the rout in banking shares \u2013 which has focused on rivals such as Deutsche Bank \u2013 continued. Gulliver said HSBC, which will be first major UK bank to report its 2015 results on 22 February, \u201cmust be cautious and realistic about the outlook for our revenues in 2016\u201d. He told staff: \u201cSince we do not control the global economy, interest rates or oil prices we must focus on what we can control, which is primarily our costs and the proactive management of our credit quality and related charges. He added: \u201cSeveral of our competitors have recently announced large-scale redundancies, salary freezes, bonus reductions and further cost reduction programmes in addition to those already in place and, hence it is clear we are not alone in facing these challenges.\u201d The about-turn was announced as the bank prepares to confirm whether it intends to move its headquarters out of the UK. Bloomberg reported this week that the bank\u2019s board is due to meet on Sunday and there is mounting speculation that the directors will vote to stay in the UK, where it has been based since 1992 after leaving Hong Kong. Gulliver said the low oil price, low interest rate environment and the uncertain economic backdrop as creating a challenging backdrop for the bank. \u201cAll of these factors are affecting stock markets with investors signalling their views on the banking sector in particular, which is the worst-performing sector thus far in 2016,\u201d he added. In June, Gulliver outlined plans to axe 25,000 jobs around the world \u2013 including up to 8,000 in the UK \u2013 as part of his plan to achieve global cost-savings of $5bn (\u00a33.3bn). A recruitment freeze remains in place. Dominic Hook, the national officer for finance at the Unite union, said: \u201cThis is a deeply embarrassing U-turn for the bank, but a victory for staff across HSBC globally. \u201cThe bank\u2019s attempt to freeze pay was grossly unfair, shamefully handled and Unite is glad that the resulting outrage has forced Stuart Gulliver to see sense. This episode shows the importance of having a recognised trade union which can make sure senior management hear the voice of staff loud and clear.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Global stock markets are sliding to new lows as fears of recession grip investors. The warning from the US Federal Reserve chair, Janet Yellen, on Wednesday that the world\u2019s biggest economy could be hit by the current turmoil led to a late sell-off on Wall Street, which has followed through to Asia and Europe on Thursday. The Dow Jones Industrial Average ended down 99 points, or 0.6%, on Wednesday while the Hang Seng slumped 3.8% as Hong Kong traders returned from their new year break \u2013 the index\u2019s worst start to the lunar new year since 1994. Nitin Dialdas, chief investment officer at Mandarin Capital in Hong Kong, told Reuters 2016 would be tough. I think this is going to be a difficult year for investors and even a fledgling US economic recovery looks to be snuffed out by global markets development. Charles Li, chief executive of the Hong Kong Stock exchange, was also gloomy: There is very little good news and continuous bad news and this is a test of market confidence. But with talk of the Bank of Japan possibly intervening to weaken the yen and some bargain hunting, markets have recovered a little from their worst levels of the day. The FTSE 100 slumped 3%, in early trading, its lowest level in three and a half years, but has recovered to 5600, a 1.27% fall. Germany\u2019s Dax, meanwhile, was down 2% by mid-afternoon and France\u2019s Cac fell 3%. In Italy the FTSE MIB lost 3.3%. Renewed worries about the eurozone and Greece\u2019s bailout measures sent the Athens market down another 1.6%. There are also doubts about Portugal\u2019s ability to stick to its bailout programme, as eurozone finance ministers meet to discuss the latest situation. Wall Street provided no respite with a 207 point or 1.3% drop on the Dow Jones Industrial Average in early trading on Thursday. Yellen\u2019s comments have reinforced fears which have been growing all year about a severe downturn in the global economy, with uncertain prospects for the Chinese market, the impact of falling commodity prices on emerging market economies and the growing financial market turmoil. She starts a second day of testimony to Congress on Thursday. Oil prices continue to slide on fears of a slowdown in demand at the same time as a supply glut, with no sign of Opec agreeing with other producers to limit output. Brent crude was down 1.6% at $30.34 a barrel on Thursday morning, while West Texas Intermediate, the US benchmark, lost 3% to $26.55. Commodity companies were among the main stock market fallers, with BP down 5% (not helped by its shares going ex-dividend). The mining group BHP Billiton fell 4% while Rio Tinto, which announced it was cutting its dividend, was down 4.7%. Banking shares were also under pressure on concerns about the outlook, with their balance sheets likely to be stretched by the current wave of negative interest rates. Sweden became the latest to announce negative rates. The Riksbank said the headline rate would fall to -.50%, from -0.35%. Even Yellen mentioned negative rates in her testimony on Wednesday, though she was unclear if such a move would be legal, suggesting the Fed had no immediate plans to follow suit. But she was forced to defend December\u2019s interest rate rise amid growing fears about the global economy, and hinted no further increases were imminent. The Stoxx 600 Banks index, which includes the main lenders in Europe, shed 6.1% to hit its lowest level since August 2012. Barclays and Standard Chartered fell 6%, while Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale was down 14% and Deutsche Bank nearly 7%. Amid the volatility, investors are looking for havens for their cash, with government bonds and precious metals in demand. Britain\u2019s 10-year government debt has hit an all-time high, with the yield on 10-year gilts, which are the benchmark for UK borrowing, falling to 1.29% on Thursday morning in a wave of buying. German government bond yields (the interest rate paid) hit a nine-month low, meaning the prices of these bonds have hit the highest level since May 2015. And the yield on US 10-year Treasury bills has hit its lowest in three years, at just 1.62%. The yen was also in demand, rising against the euro and dollar. Gold climbed to $1,211 per ounce, its highest since May 2015. So precious metal miners Randgold Resources and Fresnillo were among the few bright spots, up 5% and 4% respectively. Rabobank\u2019s European strategist, Emile Cardon, told Reuters: What this shows is that the risk-off mode has come back very quickly and that the worst may still be to come in these markets. What is different to previous times is that the bad news in now coming from everywhere \u2013 China, Portugal, the US, the commodity sector, the banking sector. It\u2019s like several smaller crises could combine into one big crisis.",

      "bodyText": "Thomas Cook has reported rising sales despite the recent spate of terrorist attacks in France, Turkey, Tunisia and Egypt, as holidaymakersopt for Spain and Bulgaria instead. The travel company said it saw \u201cclear signs of recovery\u201d, even in Turkey, after terrorism led to a sharp drop in demand for holidays, which delayed the 2016 summer booking season. Revenues at Thomas Cook rose 1% to \u00a31.4bn in the three months to 31 December. Losses before tax widened slightly to \u00a3116m from \u00a3115m, while the underlying operating loss improved by 11% to \u00a349m. Thomas Cook said it had acted quickly to offer holidaymakers alternatives to Tunisia and Egypt, by securing more beds and rerouting flights to Spain, Greece, Bulgaria, Cyprus and, further afield, the US and Cuba. The travel operator recently cancelled all British bookings to Tunisia until November after a wave of violent protests across the country. Its chief executive, Peter Fankhauser, said: \u201cIt is clear that the awful attacks in Paris and Istanbul impacted confidence, leading some customers to delay booking their holidays. However, we\u2019ve seen clear signs of recovery in recent weeks: customers still have money in their pockets, and want to go on holiday. \u201cIn this uncertain geopolitical environment, we are also seeing more of our customers choose a package holiday, valuing the greater security it provides.\u201d He said demand for Spain was soaring in the aftermath of the Istanbul attacks, which prompted Thomas Cook to cut capacity in Turkey by 29%. The country accounts for nearly a fifth of its bookings. Its rival Tui, owner of Thomson Holidays and First Choice, said this week that summer holiday bookings to Turkey had tumbled 40% due to the intensifying civil war in neighbouring Syria which had led to a mass exodus. Fankhauser was upbeat about Turkey, saying there were \u201cearly signs of recovery\u201d, adding that \u201cTurkey has the best hotels in the Mediterranean and customer demand is coming back \u2013 we are seeing it in Google searches.\u201d He said that in the past a sharp drop in demand was usually followed by a recovery \u201cpretty soon afterwards\u201d. He also said that the outbreak of the Zika virus in south America has had little impact on bookings so far. Thomas Cook is offering pregnant women the opportunity to rebook for free. This winter was going according to plan, the company said, with 82% of holidays sold, slightly behind the levels at this time last year, but margins are higher as Thomas Cook increased its prices by 4%. Summer holidays were 29% sold, 2% less than last year, with \u201cfirm pricing\u201d in most markets, it added. Summer bookings are down 5% after Thomas Cook reduced the amount of holidays it sells by 3%. In the UK, winter bookings have fallen 2% while online summer bookings are 7% ahead. The company\u2019s gross margins rose by 20 basis points, as it continues to focus on selling high-quality, all-inclusive package holidays, including \u201ccouples only\u201d or \u201cfamilies only\u201d breaks and packages at its own hotels, where sales rose 24%. Fankhauser cited the international passenger survey from the Office for National Statistics, which showed stronger growth in packages than independent holidays between 2010 and 2014. Mark Brumby, an analyst at Langton Capital, said: \u201cThomas Cook\u2019s shares have had a torrid time of it. The group flirted with death in 2012. It then righted its balance sheet and its shares moved up from sub-20p to a high of a shade under 190p. They have since halved on the back of the general market sell-off, terrorist disruption and the fear that travel patterns may take some time to return to normal.\u201d The shares rose 1.5% to 97.2p on Thursday morning. Thomas Cook said it would meet forecasts for the year to end September, assuming consumer confidence continues to recover. Analysts forecast core earnings of \u00a3347m, a 12% rise from last year. Brumby added: \u201cThomas Cook has today reassured that, though it needs the recovery that it is currently seeing to persist in order to hit forecast numbers, it has seen such crises before and believes that bookings will normalise.\u201d Separately, data from Barclaycard showed that travel transaction volumes increased 22.6%, while spend only rose 4.2% year-on-year in January, indicating that people are travelling more often but spending lower amounts on each trip.",

Its rival Tui, owner of Thomson Holidays and First Choice, said this week that<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/feb/09/turkey-holiday-bookings-hit-by-migrant-crisis-tui-says\"> summer holiday bookings to Turkey had tumbled 40%</a> due to the intensifying civil war in neighbouring Syria which had led to a mass exodus.</p> <p>Fankhauser was upbeat about Turkey, saying there were \u201cearly signs of recovery\u201d, adding that \u201cTurkey has the best hotels in the Mediterranean and customer demand is coming back \u2013 we are seeing it in Google searches.\u201d He said that in the past a sharp drop in demand was usually followed by a recovery \u201cpretty soon afterwards\u201d.</p> <p>He also said that the outbreak of the Zika virus in south America has had little impact on bookings so far. Thomas Cook is offering pregnant women the opportunity to rebook for free.</p> <p>This winter was going according to plan, the company said, with 82% of holidays sold, slightly behind the levels at this time last year, but margins are higher as Thomas Cook increased its prices by 4%. Summer holidays were 29% sold, 2% less than last year, with \u201cfirm pricing\u201d in most markets, it added.</p> <p>Summer bookings are down 5% after Thomas Cook reduced the amount of holidays it sells by 3%. In the UK, winter bookings have fallen 2% while online summer bookings are 7% ahead. </p> <p>The company\u2019s gross margins rose by 20 basis points, as it continues to focus on selling high-quality, all-inclusive package holidays, including \u201ccouples only\u201d or \u201cfamilies only\u201d breaks and packages at its own hotels, where sales rose 24%.</p> <p>Fankhauser cited the international passenger survey from the Office for National Statistics, which showed stronger growth in packages than independent holidays between 2010 and 2014.</p> <p>Mark Brumby, an analyst at Langton Capital, said: \u201cThomas Cook\u2019s shares have had a torrid time of it. The group flirted with death in 2012. It then righted its balance sheet and its shares moved up from sub-20p to a high of a shade under 190p. They have since halved on the back of the general market sell-off, terrorist disruption and the fear that travel patterns may take some time to return to normal.\u201d</p> <p>The shares rose 1.5% to 97.2p on Thursday morning. Thomas Cook said it would meet forecasts for the year to end September, assuming consumer confidence continues to recover. Analysts forecast core earnings of \u00a3347m, a 12% rise from last year.</p> <p>Brumby added: \u201cThomas Cook has today reassured that, though it needs the recovery that it is currently seeing to persist in order to hit forecast numbers, it has seen such crises before and believes that bookings will normalise.\u201d</p> <p>Separately, data from Barclaycard showed that travel transaction volumes increased 22.6%, while spend only rose 4.2% year-on-year in January, indicating that people are travelling more often but spending lower amounts on each trip.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Contrary to what business groups might say, you can have well-paid, secure jobs \u2013 and good employment growth. A study released by the OECD this week says so and the data, which examines the quality of employment, also shows that Australia has one of the highest levels of job quality in the OECD. Whenever I write about employment the common refrain is that the data ignores the quality of work \u2013 that it doesn\u2019t differentiate between a good job and one that is low-paid with equally low security. A new database from the OECD attempts to measure the good jobs. In defining quality employment, the OECD brakes it into three parts: 1. Earnings quality: how employment contributes to material living conditions, and how the earnings are distributed across the workforce. 2. Labour market security: the level of risk of becoming and staying unemployed and also, importantly, the economic consequences for workers of being laid-off. 3. The quality of the working environment: the nature and content of the work, and how much pressure the work involves. Across such measures the OECD found that Australia does quite well, noting that \u201cjob quality is the highest in Australia, Austria, Denmark, Finland, Germany, Luxemburg, Norway and Switzerland\u201d. On the measure of earnings quality, Australia\u2019s lower levels of inequality compared with the US, Canada and the UK saw its quality of earnings much improved compared with the more standard measure of \u201caverage earnings\u201d: Where Australia comes to the fore is on the measure of \u201cjob strain\u201d. This attempts to look at the level of work required to be done by employees relative to the amount of resources available. Here Australia was second-best, only behind New Zealand. Australia also performed well on the measures of unemployment risk \u2013 reflecting the strength of our labour market compared with most other OECD nations. But the rate of our unemployment benefits did seem to have Australia scoring only in the middle on the measure of labour market insecurity. While losing a job was not viewed as detrimental to one\u2019s income, as in nations such as the US, UK or New Zealand, Australia scored well below the most secure employment nations such as Norway, Switzerland and Luxembourg: The OECD also examined the impact of the global financial crisis. It found that in the United Kingdom, where employment is almost back to pre-GFC levels, earnings quality decreased form 2007-2013. In essence the results show that in the UK the work that replaced the jobs lost during the GFC was of lower quality \u2013 bad jobs replacing good ones. In Australia, even with our low wage growth, average earnings have risen better than most across the OECD. But because of an increase in inequality from 2007 to 2013, the growth in \u201cquality earnings\u201d in Australia in that time is slightly less than average: The OECD found that differences in the quality of work extended across the labour force. It found that youth and \u201cthe unskilled not only tend to have the worst performance in terms of employment but they also have lower earnings and considerably higher labour market insecurity and higher job strain.\u201d Certainly, in all but three countries, job insecurity was greater for low-skilled workers than it was for high-skilled. The difference between the levels of job security was generally more marked in those nations with high unemployment, but Australia found itself in the middle of the pack: The study also found that across the OECD women suffer from substantially lower employment rates than men and face a large pay gap. They are on average, however, less likely than men to experience job strain: Young people are the ones for whom job insecurity is the greatest, and they and low-skilled workers are also more likely to be in a position of job strain. The study also found that there was no trade-off between job quality and higher employment rates. In fact it found that \u201ccountries that do relatively poorly with respect to job quality tend to have relatively low employment rates and vice-versa\u201d. For example, those countries with low levels of job strain were shown to be more likely to have high levels of employment \u2013 in effect showing you don\u2019t need to have employees doing more work to reduce unemployment: Similarly, while the link between labour market security and employment was less strong, there was certainly a positive relationship between the two. Those nations whose employees were less at risk from loss of income due to losing their job \u2013 either through having high unemployment benefits or insurance, or solid employment growth \u2013 were found to be more likely to have higher rates of employment: The study also dispelled the belief that high wages hurt employment. There was essentially no link between the two, but if anything there was a slight relationship wherein nations with higher levels of quality earnings also had higher levels of employment: Everyone knows that not all jobs are equal \u2013 even within the same occupation there are good jobs and jobs with little security. Often we\u2019re told by business groups that we need to worry about competitiveness and that Australian wages are too high and our labour conditions need to be more flexible (i.e. less secure for employees) if we are to reduce unemployment and get more people into work. This new data from the OECD is a strong rebuke to such notions.",

      "bodyText": "Britain\u2019s leading employers\u2019 organisation, the Confederation of British Industry, has warned that the growth prospects for the UK economy have dimmed since George Osborne\u2019s autumn statement three months ago. Cutting its forecasts for both 2016 and 2017, the CBI said a weaker performance at the end of last year coupled with a less rosy outlook for household spending, trade and investment had led to the growth downgrade. The employers\u2019 body said it expected economic growth, as measured by gross domestic product, to be 2.3% in 2016 and 2.1% in 2017 - in both cases a 0.3 percentage point reduction on the forecasts made in November 2015. The CBI said household spending would be constrained by modest pay increases and the struggle to raise productivity levels. The poorer growth prospects for the UK would enable the Bank of England to keep interest rates on hold at 0.5% for the rest of the year. With just more than a month to go until Osborne delivers his budget, the independent Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) is currently preparing new forecasts for the economy. Those prepared for the autumn statement pencilled in growth of 2.4% in 2016 and 2.5% in 2017. Since then, however, revisions to GDP data have suggested that the economy was less strong in 2015 than previously thought, and this could force the OBR to revise down its growth predictions. Weaker GDP growth would have a knock-on effect on the OBR\u2019s predictions for tax revenues and the size of the government\u2019s budget deficit, projected to fall from \u00a369bn in the current 2015-16 financial year to \u00a347bn in 2016-17 and \u00a322bn in 2017-18. Despite the turbulence in the financial markets that has marked the first six weeks of 2016, the CBI believes the UK economy is resilient enough to withstand the pressures. Carolyn Fairbairn, the CBI\u2019s director general, said: \u201cThe UK is likely to remain among the fastest-growing advanced economies, with strong fundamentals, though our forecast recognises growing overseas risks. \u201cWhile there\u2019s little current evidence of uncertainty negatively affecting business investment ahead of the EU referendum, this is a potential risk to the UK\u2019s solid economic outlook, along with concerns over China and emerging markets. \u201cAnd despite domestic demand remaining healthy, it\u2019s clear that increasing productivity remains a priority as a means of achieving sustainable wage growth.\u201d",
