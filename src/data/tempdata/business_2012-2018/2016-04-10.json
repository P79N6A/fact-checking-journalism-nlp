      "bodyText": "Tesco is expected to reveal its first quarter of underlying sales growth for more than three years when the supermarket reports its full-year results on Wednesday. Analysts think the country\u2019s biggest retailer is winning back shoppers with better service and lower prices in its stores. House broker Barclays is predicting a 0.8% increase in sales at established UK stores for the three months to February. That would be a continuation of the strong Christmas trading period when Tesco revealed a surprise 1.3% rise in underlying sales over six weeks. Recent data from market analysts at Kantar Worldpanel also indicated Tesco had halved the pace of its sales decline as price cuts helped stem the loss of customers. A rise in sales would be good news for chief executive Dave Lewis who is under pressure to show results from his turnaround plan, which kicked off in autumn 2014. Lewis was parachuted in to lead the business following the sacking of Philip Clarke. The business was subsequently engulfed in an accounting scandal after a whistleblower revealed supplier payments were mishandled \u2013 a matter that is the subject of an ongoing criminal investigation by the Serious Fraud Office \u2013 when Clarke was in charge. Last year Tesco crashed to the biggest loss ever recorded on the UK high street, slumping \u00a36.4bn into the red after taking massive writedowns on its property portfolio and stock. James Anstead at Barclays said: \u201cMomentum has returned to the sales line, but headwinds have not disappeared ... The discounters continue to open stores and take market share, ASDA seems to be sharpening its offer and there will likely be cost pressure from the National Living Wage, business rates and rental costs.\u201d Lewis has warned the City to expect the same level of underlying profits this year as it focuses on staying competitive in a tough grocery market where discounters Aldi and Lidl are still storming ahead. Analysts have pencilled in underlying profits of \u00a3932m \u2013 a stark contrast with the \u00a34bn it was making four years ago. As the price war continues, Tesco revealed its latest blow in the price war on Monday. The supermarket said it would accept vouchers from Sainsbury\u2019s Brand Match promotion in order to get money off their shopping until June. The promotion will be short-lived, however, as Sainsbury\u2019s announced last week that it would stop handing out Brand Match vouchers on 26 April In the autumn Lewis bought the retailer some breathing space by selling off its South Korean chain for \u00a34bn, as well as some of its UK landbank, to cut debt. Anstead said he did not expect Tesco to reintroduce the dividend in the near future as its balance sheet remained stretched.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "B&amp;Q has withdrawn an advertisement for jobs at its Swindon warehouse that required jobseekers to work three days\u2019 \u201cinduction\u201d for free and pay for a drugs test. The ad for order-pickers offered to pay between \u00a37.50 and \u00a38 an hour depending on the time of day. It said: \u201cEach candidate will undergo three-day induction programme which will be unpaid.\u201d It also said candidates must pay \u00a315 to take a drugs test, with the money refunded if they passed the test. After being alerted to the advert by the Guardian, B&amp;Q said it was contrary to the company\u2019s recruitment policy and that it had asked for it to be removed. The DIY chain is part of Kingfisher, a FTSE 100 company. The ad raises further questions about the treatment of low-paid workers by large companies. It follows the Guardian\u2019s exposure of Sports Direct for effectively paying below the minimum wage by requiring staff at its warehouse to go through lengthy security checks without pay. Sports Direct has since started paying workers for this time. It also highlights the convoluted chain of firms often involved in hiring workers for basic jobs. The distribution centre is run for B&amp;Q by Wincanton, a publicly quoted warehouse and supply chain operator, which used an employment agency to recruit staff. The ad was then sent to jobseekers by Seetec, which works for the government to get the unemployed back to work \u2013 raising the prospect of vulnerable people feeling under pressure to work for nothing. A B&amp;Q spokesperson said: \u201cWe were unaware of this advert and these terms and conditions are in no way reflective of our standard policy. We are working with Wincanton to have this advert removed immediately and to ensure our standard policy is followed for payment and recruitment of staff.\u201d Wincanton declined to say if workers at Swindon or any of its sites had been asked to attend the induction without pay and would not give details of its recruitment standards. It also declined to clarify whether applicants were meant to attend the unpaid induction before or after they were offered a job. A Wincanton spokesperson said: \u201cWincanton manages B&amp;Q\u2019s Swindon distribution centre, where we work with a recruitment agency. We were unaware of this advert, which has been removed. We have been working closely with B&amp;Q and the agency in question to ensure that our policy is followed for payment and recruitment of staff.\u201d Nick Fry, an employment specialist at law firm Bindmans, said the terms advertised appeared unusual and that the law said workers should be paid for the work they do. He said: \u201cAn induction is usually carried out after a person has been taken on to do the job and it\u2019s paid. This job advert suggests they are going to do the induction and then offer the employment contract afterwards. The induction seems to be part of the recruitment stage. Generally speaking, workers should be paid for days worked, under their employment contract. If there\u2019s an oral or written contract in place and the employment has started, they should be paid.\u201d The ad originated with GB Recruitment, an agency in Newport, Wales. Darren Bourne, one of the contacts listed at GB, said candidates would not be paid \u201cas such\u201d and that if they were sent for training by a jobcentre they would not expect to be paid. Bourne did not reply to attempts to find out more information. Seetec administers government-funded schemes for the Department for Work and Pensions to get unemployed people back into work. A spokeswoman for Seetec said the company\u2019s role is to draw clients\u2019 attention to job vacancies, though she acknowledged it had a responsibility to check that terms and conditions were fair. B&amp;Q is already the subject of an online petition against its plan to cut Sunday pay and reduce bank holiday rates for some shop workers in return for lifting minimum basic wages above the government\u2019s \u201cnational living wage\u201d.",

    "webTitle": "Former health secretary accused over publishing company insolvency", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The business practices of Stephen Dorrell have been called into question after a business partner accused the former health secretary of leaving him with nothing. Dorrell used a controversial insolvency procedure to move a publishing company into a new corporate entity owned by himself, making shares owned by his business partner worthless and allegedly thwarting an unfair dismissal claim against the company. Dorrell is the chairman of the NHS Confederation and was health secretary between 1995 and 1997. He served as a Conservative MP for 36 years until he stood down at the last election. Project Viva, which published specialist health and motoring magazines, called in administrators last month and was immediately bought by Dorrell\u2019s investment vehicle Dorson Transform through a pre-pack administration. Pre-pack administration is lawful but controversial because it allows a company effectively to walk away from its debts. Project Viva was 35% owned by Dorrell\u2019s wife, 30% owned by financier Paul Meier, and 35% by Kate Rogers, whose husband Matti is a publisher and helped to set the business up. Matti Rogers claims he and Kate were pushed out of their roles at the company last summer after opposing Dorrell\u2019s proposals to take over Project Viva. Dorrell said their positions had been made redundant. The Guardian has seen emails from Dorrell showing that he proposed moving Project Viva into Dorson with Rogers and his wife remunerated as employees, rather than shareholders. Rogers and his wife, Kate, launched an unfair dismissal case against the company, but that is now effectively worthless because their claim is against Project Viva, whose assets have been bought by Dorrell\u2019s vehicle. This is not the first time that Dorrell has been caught up in controversy. His behaviour was branded \u201ccompletely immoral\u201d seven years ago after a South African company was left with worthless paper shares after selling Dorrell its UK clothing business. LA Group sold its clothing operations for \u00a31m of shares in Wensum, a company that Dorrell chaired and had a major stake in. However, a month after the deal the assets of Wensum were moved into a new business through a pre-pack administration. While LA Group ended up with nothing, Dorrell had a 15% stake in the new business and collected a \u00a3200,000 salary as a director. He also faced calls to resign as an MP in 2014 after taking on a lucrative role as a health consultant with KPMG, the accountancy firm. Critics claimed it was conflict of interests because KPMG was looking at bidding for a \u00a31bn contract with the NHS. Dorrell\u2019s behaviour has drawn criticism from staff at Project Viva. An editor of one the magazines it published, Andy Hornsby, sent an email to suppliers and customers saying he was leaving the company on the back of the pre-pack. In the email from Hornsby, seen by the Guardian, he claims that Dorrell had told him the company was going through the pre-pack administration to avoid the unfair dismissal claim and that he expressed his \u201cdisapproval\u201d. Hornsby wrote: \u201cI really should try to write it as a script for a sitcom, except a lot of the stuff between the lines is frankly too implausible.\u201d In another email directly to Dorrell, the former health secretary is told the reason for the pre-pack administration is morally objectionable. Rogers said the pre-pack administration showed that the insolvency system in Britain was \u201cflawed\u201d. In a statement, he said: \u201cDespite the Graham Review recommendations instigated by Vince Cable and endorsed by the government, it is still possible for the directors and/or owners of an insolvent business to emerge the other side of an insolvency process at the expense of selected creditors and minority shareholders. \u201cYet again, to requote another of Stephen Dorrell\u2019s former shareholders, the process was like a spider eviscerating a fly it has caught, taking all the good bits, then dropping the useless carcass, which is the creditors, the shareholders and of course the taxpayer.\u201d When contacted by the Guardian, Dorrell said that Project Viva was placed into administration \u201cbecause the board concluded that it was unable to meet its obligations\u201d. He denied he had proposed moving Project Viva into Dorson Transform through a pre-pack of administration in July 2015 and said that Rogers and his wife had left the company because \u201ctheir positions were declared redundant\u201d. When asked whether he regretted what had happened and whether it was morally acceptable, Dorrell said: \u201cI believe the directors\u2019 actions secured the interests of creditors and protected the jobs of nine staff.\u201d",

His behaviour <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/retailandconsumer/6209674/Stephen-Dorrell-criticised-over-immoral-deal.html\">was branded \u201ccompletely immoral\u201d seven</a> <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/retailandconsumer/6209674/Stephen-Dorrell-criticised-over-immoral-deal.html\">years ago</a> after a South African company was left with worthless paper shares after selling Dorrell its UK clothing business. LA Group sold its clothing operations for \u00a31m of shares in Wensum, a company that Dorrell chaired and had a major stake in.</p> <p>However, a month after the deal the assets of Wensum were moved into a new business through a pre-pack administration. While LA Group ended up with nothing, Dorrell had a 15% stake in the new business and collected a \u00a3200,000 salary as a director.</p> <p>He also faced calls to resign as an MP in 2014 after taking on a lucrative role as a health consultant with KPMG, the accountancy firm. Critics claimed it was conflict of interests because KPMG was looking at bidding for a \u00a31bn contract with the NHS.</p> <p>Dorrell\u2019s behaviour has drawn criticism from staff at Project Viva. An editor of one the magazines it published, Andy Hornsby, sent an email to suppliers and customers saying he was leaving the company on the back of the pre-pack. <br></p> <p>In the email from Hornsby, seen by the Guardian, he claims that Dorrell had told him the company was going through the pre-pack administration to avoid the unfair dismissal claim and that he expressed his \u201cdisapproval\u201d. Hornsby wrote: \u201cI really should try to write it as a script for a sitcom, except a lot of the stuff between the lines is frankly too implausible.\u201d</p> <p>In another email directly to Dorrell, the former health secretary is told the reason for the pre-pack administration is morally objectionable.</p> <p>Rogers said the pre-pack administration showed that the insolvency system in Britain was \u201cflawed\u201d. In a statement, he said: \u201cDespite the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/jul/15/vince-cable-zombie-companies-economy\">Graham Review recommendations</a> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/jul/15/vince-cable-zombie-companies-economy\">instigated by Vince Cable and endorsed by the government</a>, it is still possible for the directors and/or owners of an insolvent business to emerge the other side of an insolvency process at the expense of selected creditors and minority shareholders.</p> <p>\u201cYet again, to requote another of Stephen Dorrell\u2019s former shareholders, the process was like a spider eviscerating a fly it has caught, taking all the good bits, then dropping the useless carcass, which is the creditors, the shareholders and of course the taxpayer.\u201d</p> <p>When contacted by the Guardian, Dorrell said that Project Viva was placed into administration \u201cbecause the board concluded that it was unable to meet its obligations\u201d. He denied he had proposed moving Project Viva into Dorson Transform through a pre-pack of administration in July 2015 and said that Rogers and his wife had left the company because \u201ctheir positions were declared redundant\u201d.<br></p> <p>When asked whether he regretted what had happened and whether it was morally acceptable, Dorrell said: \u201cI believe the directors\u2019 actions secured the interests of creditors and protected the jobs of nine staff.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "Campaigners claim BP has failed to do enough on environmental pledges made at last year\u2019s annual general meeting (AGM) and will hold bosses to account at the oil company\u2019s shareholder gathering. At last year\u2019s AGM, BP worked with groups under the \u201cAiming for A\u201d banner on a resolution committing it to greater openness about its impact on climate change. The resolution, supported by the board, received 98% shareholder approval and the company\u2019s new environmental awareness won wide praise. BP promised to reveal more about: the impact of carbon emission limits on the value of its oil and gas reserves; its investments in low-carbon technology; carbon dioxide emissions from its operations; linking executive pay to greenhouse gas reduction; and its lobbying on climate change. But ShareAction, the responsible investment group, says in the year since the resolution was passed BP has fallen well short of the commitments it made. In particular the company has failed to make the shift needed to align itself with a target set in Paris in December to limit global temperature increases to 2C with an aspiration of 1.5C. In a report to be published on Monday, ShareAction says: BP continues to question the likelihood of a 2C scenario coming into effect, and its \u201cbase case\u201d for fossil fuel demand assumes with an increase of 4-to-6C Management\u2019s targets and pay incentives continue to encourage the replenishing of fossil fuel reserves The company has not published a strategy for wind-down or business diversification to suit an economy with less than 2C warming. In many cases, the company fails to address requests made by investors in the supporting statement circulated with last year\u2019s resolutions. ShareAction said BP\u2019s chief executive Bob Dudley was paid almost $20m (\u00a314m) last year based on incentives that continue to encourage fossil fuel exploration. The campaigning group, which will challenge the board at the annual meeting on 14 April, called on investors who supported last year\u2019s resolution to push BP for stronger action. The company is also braced for a row over pay. A number of advisory groups have advised voting against the pay report, including Pirc, which said Dudley\u2019s pay \u2013 which rose 20% despite job cuts and record losses, was excessive because he was paid more than five times his $1.85m salary in share awards. The Aiming for A coalition, which includes church investors and pension funds, is putting forward a similar resolution on climate risk to the AGM of Rio Tinto, the mining company, which takes place on the same day as BP\u2019s meeting \u2013 Thursday. ShareAction said it would press Rio Tinto on how it would implement pledges in the resolution, in light of what it argues is disappointing progress by BP. Catherine Howarth, ShareAction\u2019s chief executive, said: \u201cRio Tinto\u2019s recommendation to vote for this shareholder resolution on climate risk is welcome. However, as our analysis of BP shows, it\u2019s one thing for a company to publicly support a vote in favour and quite another for it to respond with meaningful follow-up action. \u201cEngaged shareholders will expect Rio Tinto to provide a clear and detailed plan for how it will respond to the spirit and intention of this resolution, assuming it passes at the AGM.\u201d Helen Wildsmith, head of stewardship at the fund manager CCLA, which is part of the Aiming for A coalition, said BP had made progress on carbon pricing, preparing for a faster transition to renewable energy and reporting its resilience to climate change. She said Aiming for A would ask questions about BP\u2019s next steps. A Rio Tinto spokesman said: \u201cThe management team will review our existing disclosures, commitments and carbon-related activities and assess what additional reporting on risks associated to climate change may be required as well as the format for such additional reporting.\u201d Rio Tinto will also face protests from the London Mining Network over the company\u2019s environmental record, treatment of workers and effects on local populations at its sites. A BP spokesperson said the \u201cbase case\u201d is what the company believed was most likely, not what it would like to see and that it had businesses in wind and biofuels. \u201cWe also believe a faster transition, with higher carbon prices and stricter policy and regulation, is possible in which CO2 emissions could peak around 2020 and be around 8% lower by 2035 than they are today. \u201cEven in this faster transition oil and gas would still continue to provide the lion\u2019s share of global energy to 2035, but renewables would grow very rapidly. BP\u2019s own portfolio of businesses is balanced and diversified, with around half oil and half gas and the proportion of gas growing.\u201d\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The collapse in global commodity prices and a stronger US dollar have depleted the public coffers of some of the world\u2019s poorest countries and will leave them as much as $61bn (\u00a343bn) worse off this year, a report has warned. The Jubilee Debt Campaign said that countries that relied on exports of commodities such as metals and oil had seen government revenues hit by a global markets rout last year that knocked the prices of crude oil, iron ore, copper and other raw materials to multi-year lows. At the same time, a drop in their currencies against the US dollar were making it harder for governments in poor countries to make debt payments in dollars, the anti-poverty campaigners said. \u201cMany impoverished country governments are being hit by the fall in prices for the commodities they export, and large depreciations of currencies against the dollar,\u201d said Tim Jones, economist at the Jubilee Debt Campaign. \u201cThis is reducing government revenue, and increasing the relative size of debt payments in foreign currencies. On top of this, less tax is being collected than had been expected.\u201d Commodity collapse The analysis of low and lower middle income country governments showed their external debt service payments in 2016 will on average be 10.8% of government revenue, compared with 6.1% predicted three years ago. Publishing the findings ahead of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and World Bank\u2019s spring meetings later this week, the campaigners called for more help for poor countries struggling with high debts. \u201cIn the 1980s commodity prices crashed and the US dollar rose, and the result was 20 years of debt crisis and large increases in poverty. To ensure history is not repeated, urgent global action is needed to cancel debts owed to reckless lenders, tackle tax avoidance and evasion, and change global trade rules to enable countries to diversify out of basic commodities,\u201d said Jones. The authors calculated the figures by comparing IMF and World Bank predictions made in 2012 and 2013 for GDP, government revenue and debt payments with those produced between August and December 2015. Numbers were available for 18 countries and the average losses calculated from those 18 were then applied to a further 33 countries. Taken together, the blow from lower commodity prices and weaker currencies left the 51 countries analysed as much as $61bn worse off in 2016 and $53bn worse off in 2017. For comparison, that 2016 shortfall was $13bn more than the $48bn of aid spent in the 51 countries, Jones said citing figures from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. Jones highlighted the case of Sierra Leone\u2019s economy, hit both by the Ebola crisis and the collapse in the price of iron ore. Government revenue in 2016 is now expected to be $470m, compared with a prediction of $760m three years ago. However, debt payments in 2016 will be lower than previously predicted, primarily because of a suspension of debt payments to the IMF in response to the Ebola outbreak.",

      "bodyText": "\u201cWhy would you trust a man about the European Union if you can\u2019t trust him on his own tax affairs?\u201d The comment from Ian Davidson, the former Labour MP who is campaigning for a no vote in June\u2019s referendum, was succinct and right on the money. David Cameron\u2019s reputation has suffered as a result of the failure to come clean from the start about how he benefited from the offshore trust fund set up by his father. What\u2019s more, the revelations in the Panama Papers come at a time when the prime minister\u2019s credibility will matter immensely. Here\u2019s the position. The government has a tried and tested model for winning over the public in key electoral tests. It makes a case for the status quo, argues that the alternative is fraught with danger and relies on the innate conservatism of voters to carry the day. It worked in the Scottish referendum, it worked in the 2015 general election and the bookmakers think it will work again on 23 June. The idea is to nag away, to keep pointing out the threats to jobs and investment, in the belief that undecided voters will eventually conclude that the risk is simply not worth taking. The approach is not glamorous. It is not romantic. But it has proved quietly effective. Cameron\u2019s line on the EU referendum has been consistent since the renegotiations were wrapped up in February. Look, he has said, I am no great fan of Europe. I opposed Britain joining the euro and would never contemplate giving up the pound. Europe needs to change, but those proposing Brexit are ignoring the dangers and the costs of leaving. Divorce will be long and protracted. A better option would be to stay in and fight for a reformed Europe rather than walk into the unknown. The strategy is far from perfect. It glides over the fact that the economic performance of the eurozone has been dismal, with unemployment still above 10% and growth - such as it is - dependent on negative interest rates and large dollops of quantitative easing from the European Central Bank. The eurozone will continue in this zombie-like state until one of two things happens. Either it breaks up or the countries using the single currency decide they have to integrate further to make it successful. Cameron knows as much. He is aware that Britain\u2019s continued membership of the EU will continue to be a live issue if the eurozone stumbles from crisis to crisis in the next decade. That\u2019s why he and his ministers have focused so tightly on the short-term, on the transitional costs of exit. This makes sense. For a start, it is obvious that there will be financial turmoil in the event that Britain votes to leave on 23 June. Indeed, the turbulence will probably start before the referendum if the opinion polls suggest the government\u2019s gamble has failed. Business confidence will take a hit and investment decisions will be mothballed. Consumers will find that a falling pound means imported goods are more expensive and that they have less to spend when they go abroad. Growth in 2016 and 2017 will be lower. The Brexit camp has not really worked out a way of countering this. One option is to deny that there will be any economic fallout and that life will go on merrily as before. This was the approach Alex Salmond tried in the Scottish independence referendum. Another is to admit that there will be a shock to the economy, but that it won\u2019t last long. Britain will renegotiate a trade deal with its former EU partners, but will do more business with those parts of the world that are thriving rather than stagnating. The failure to spell out how the UK will cope during this period has been a key weakness for the Leave campaign, which has been pretty unconvincing when pressed about what sort of arrangement there would be with the EU after independence. Voters might not know the difference between the Norwegian, the Swiss, the Canadian and the WTO options, but they know when politicians are winging it. In the circumstances, the Brexit camp can hardly believe its luck. Cameron\u2019s approach only works if he is trusted, if his version of the future is more believable than those of his opponents. The experience of the last EU referendum in 1975 shows that the prestige of the prime ministerial office should not be under-estimated. Barbara Castle, who was campaigning to leave, recorded in her diaries that voters in her Blackburn constituency were happy to take their lead from Harold Wilson, who wanted to stay in. So when the government\u2019s glossy leaflet is delivered to households this week, the Brexit campaign has a ready response. It is simply another dodgy dossier from a man who is not to be trusted. Cameron has spiked his own big gun. For the first time, the prime minister\u2019s approval ratings are lower than those of Jeremy Corbyn, and he will need help from the Labour leader to secure enough votes to win on 23 June. The idea that he can count on Corbyn\u2019s full-throated support seems a bit improbable. The leader of the opposition has never been a fan of the EU, warned that the single currency would be a job-destroying machine and would almost certainly be in the Brexit camp were it not for the fact that he was chosen to succeed Ed Miliband. Nor does Corbyn owe Cameron anything personally. If you are going to rely on a political rival for help, it is not the smartest idea to tell them at prime minister\u2019s questions to \u201cput on a proper suit, do up your tie and sing the national anthem\u201d. If Corbyn is thirsting for revenge after being treated with such disdain, few would blame him. The experience of the Scottish referendum also suggests that Cameron\u2019s gratitude for any support received will be shortlived. Miliband supported the Better Together side strongly, only to find that within an hour of the vote being announced the prime minister was challenging Labour to back \u201cEnglish votes for English laws\u201d, something designed to add to the opposition\u2019s discomfort north of the border. Cameron\u2019s approach is that favoured by defenders of the status quo down the ages. Change is dangerous. More often than not it proves to be a successful strategy, but not always. The status quo would have meant Lord Halifax rather than Churchill as prime minister in 1940 and Churchill rather than Attlee in 1945. Corbyn was the change candidate, not the status quo candidate when he became Labour leader. He is well aware that the tactics Cameron used to fight the referendum will be used against him in 2020. Expect him to let the prime minister squirm for a bit. \u2022 This article was amended on 12 April 2016. An earlier version described Ian Davidson as a Labour MP. He is a former MP.",

      "bodyText": "First the bad news. After fifteen years in the global economic growth fast lane, sub-Saharan Africa is reeling from the effects of falling commodity prices, depressed Chinese demand, and deteriorating financial conditions. The IMF has revised growth forecasts down to 3.5% for 2016, from an annual average rate in excess of 5% since 2000. Now for the good news. Africa\u2019s economic slowdown is a wake-up call and an opportunity to rethink an economic model that is failing. The impressive growth record of the past 15 years has roughly doubled output, but with limited results for poverty reduction, job creation and productivity. Already extreme inequality is rising in many countries. Manufacturing has stagnated. The challenge for policy-makers is to set a course for recovery that supports more inclusive growth, while preparing the ground for an economic transformation. Meeting that challenge in the midst of an economic downturn will not be easy. Having ridden the wave of the commodity super-cycle, Africa has been hit hard by the slump in oil and metal prices. Dependent on oil for 70% of government revenue, Nigeria has been forced to turn to the World Bank and the African Development Bank for an emergency loan to plug an expanding budget deficit. Weak commodity prices are magnifying already unsustainable fiscal deficits in Ghana and Zambia. Eurobond markets that two years ago looked like a source of \u2018cheap money\u2019 are delivering their own verdict. The combination of currency devaluation, shrinking foreign exchange buffers and slower growth has pushed typical yields on African bonds from 3-4% two years ago to 8-9% today. Real as the immediate costs of adjustment are, they should not deflect attention from the deeper failures. While economic output has doubled over the past fifteen years, poverty incidence has fallen modestly \u2013 from 57% to 42% \u2013 and the number of poor has risen with population growth. High levels of income inequality are weakening the conversion of growth into poverty reduction. They are also reinforcing wider disparities in education, health and access to basic services that act as a brake on growth itself, creating a double whammy effect. Other indicators of progress point in a worrying direction. While commodity exports have boomed, Africa\u2019s share of world trade has stagnated at just 2% \u2013 and the share of manufacturing in production and exports has declined. Sub-Saharan Africa remains trapped in low value-added segments of international trade. To make matters worse, the region\u2019s competitive position has deteriorated relative to emerging markets like Vietnam and Bangladesh. Adjusted for productivity real wages are higher, especially for skilled labour. The costs of transport are prohibitive: exporting a container from sub-Saharan Africa typically costs $2,200 (\u00a31557) compared with $610 for Vietnam. Africa\u2019s energy grid produces less electricity than Argentina, forcing firms to install high-cost, low efficiency diesel generators. None of the barriers to more inclusive and dynamic economic growth are immovable. But undertaking painful adjustments while waiting for an upturn in global markets will not deliver results. As the African Center for Economic Transformation have argued, there is an urgent need for governments to develop national strategies aimed at fostering the entry of firms into higher value-added areas of labour-intensive production. Three essential pillars have to be put in place. First, education and skills development are the only secure foundation for inclusive growth \u2013 and Africa lacks those foundations. Fewer than one-in-three of the region\u2019s children make it to upper secondary school, starving firms of skilled workers and closing an escape route from poverty. To make matters worse the quality of education is abysmal. In Vietnam, sustained growth has been underpinned by the development of an education system that is producing learning outcomes to rival those in the UK. Tanzania is seeking to achieve universal secondary schooling. But after five years of schooling, fewer than half of the country\u2019s children can pass a grade 2 numeracy test \u2013 and the case is not untypical. Fixing Africa\u2019s failing education systems should be seen as a top economic policy priority. Demography adds to the urgency. By 2030 the number of Africans aged 15-to-24 will rise by 100 million. Equipping this rising generation with skills would act as a catalyst for dynamic and inclusive growth. Yet few political leaders have grasped the nettle of education reform. The second priority is agriculture. Former UN secretary general, Kofi Annan, has rightly decried the fact that Africa is spending some US$35bn annually importing food, much of which could be grown by Africa\u2019s farmers. Farm productivity is rising, impressively so in countries like Ethiopia and Rwanda. But weak infrastructure, regional trade barriers and the boost to imports provided by over-valued currencies continue to price African producers out of markets, limiting the development of a vibrant agriculture and agro-processing sector. Infrastructure development is the third priority. The World Bank estimates that Africa needs some $93bn a year to fund investments in roads, ports and energy. There are huge untapped opportunities, not least in renewable energy. Seizing those opportunities will require a step-increase in international development finance provided in the form of investment risk guarantees and equity, rather than aid. But African governments also need to underpin capital investment with domestic tax revenues. As recent IMF research has highlighted, tax-to-GDP ratios are far too low in countries such as Ghana, Kenya, Nigeria and Tanzania, reflecting a failure to reform weak and regressive tax systems. Over the past fifteen years, Africa has shaken off the mantle of economic pessimism from an earlier era. The opportunities \u2013 for investment, growth and poverty reduction \u2013 can hardly be overstated. But neither can the risks that will attend a failure to embark on a pathway to inclusive growth. \u2022 Kevin Watkins is director of the Overseas Development Institute This article was amended on 12 April",

But undertaking painful adjustments while waiting for an upturn in global markets will not deliver results. As the <a href=\"http://africantransformation.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/2014-african-transformation-report.pdf\">African Center for Economic Transformation have argued</a>, there is an urgent need for governments to develop national strategies aimed at fostering the entry of firms into higher value-added areas of labour-intensive production. Three essential pillars have to be put in place.</p> <p>First, education and skills development are the only secure foundation for inclusive growth \u2013 and Africa lacks those foundations. Fewer than one-in-three of the region\u2019s children make it to upper secondary school, starving firms of skilled workers and closing an escape route from poverty.</p> <p>To make matters worse the quality of education is abysmal. In Vietnam, sustained growth has been underpinned by the development of an education system that is producing learning outcomes to rival those in the UK. Tanzania is seeking to achieve universal secondary schooling. But after five years of schooling, fewer than half of the country\u2019s children can pass a grade 2 numeracy test \u2013 and the case is not untypical.</p> <p>Fixing Africa\u2019s failing education systems should be seen as a top economic policy priority.</p> <p>Demography adds to the urgency. By 2030 the number of Africans aged 15-to-24 will rise by 100 million. Equipping this rising generation with skills would act as a catalyst for dynamic and inclusive growth. Yet few political leaders have grasped the nettle of education reform.</p> <p>The second priority is agriculture. Former UN secretary general, Kofi Annan, has rightly decried the fact that Africa is spending some <a href=\"http://app-cdn.acwupload.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/APP_APR2014_24june.pdf\">US$35bn annually importing food</a>, much of which could be grown by Africa\u2019s farmers. Farm productivity is rising, impressively so in countries like Ethiopia and Rwanda. But weak infrastructure, regional trade barriers and the boost to imports provided by over-valued currencies continue to price African producers out of markets, limiting the development of a vibrant agriculture and agro-processing sector.</p> <p>Infrastructure development is the third priority. <a href=\"http://www.afdb.org/en/topics-and-sectors/sectors/private-sector/areas-of-focus/infrastructure-finance/\">The World Bank estimates that Africa needs some $93bn a year</a> to fund investments in roads, ports and energy. There are huge untapped opportunities, not least in renewable energy. Seizing those opportunities will require a step-increase in international development finance provided in the form of investment risk guarantees and equity, rather than aid.</p> <p>But African governments also need to underpin capital investment with domestic tax revenues. As <a href=\"http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/reo/2015/afr/eng/pdf/sreo1015.pdf\">recent IMF research has highlighted</a>, tax-to-GDP ratios are far too low in countries such as Ghana, Kenya, Nigeria and Tanzania, reflecting a failure to reform weak and regressive tax systems.</p> <p>Over the past fifteen years, Africa has shaken off the mantle of economic pessimism from an earlier era. The opportunities \u2013 for investment, growth and poverty reduction \u2013 can hardly be overstated. But neither can the risks that will attend a failure to embark on a pathway to inclusive growth.</p> <p>\u2022 Kevin Watkins is director of the Overseas Development Institute<br></p> <ul> <li>This article was amended on 12 April</li> </ul>",

      "bodyText": "Tesco has taken some flak recently for using fictional UK farm names on its new own-brand ranges, in an effort to convince shoppers that it is backing British producers. But the supermarket group may have a better tale to tell when it reports annual results on Wednesday, the first full year figures under the watch of ex-Unilever boss Dave Lewis, who joined as chief executive in September 2014. The brand revamp is part of Tesco\u2019s attempt to revive its fortunes after an accounting scandal hit its reputation and shoppers deserted its dowdy stores for the attractions of discounters Aldi and Lidl. Lewis is trying to halt the decline by focusing on low prices, improved customer service and better relationships with suppliers (the non-fictional kind). He has also sold the group\u2019s struggling South Korean business and cut costs by, among other things, shedding thousands of jobs. Its update should show some signs he is succeeding, although there is still a way to go. His cost reduction efforts have boosted the balance sheet, and fears of an emergency cash call have receded. Analysts at Barclays, the supermarket\u2019s broker, expect earnings to be down from \u00a31.23bn to \u00a3921m. On the positive side, they forecast a 0.8% rise in like-for-like sales in the final three months of the year, the first positive quarter in more than three years. But the competitive threat from the discounters, plus Asda and now Amazon, will not go away, so the final chapter of Tesco\u2019s revival story is by no means written in stone. An evening worth flying in from Panama for Now this is timely. The Resolution Foundation thinktank had no idea that the Panama papers, revealing details of how the rich can exploit secretive offshore tax regimes, were about to hit the headlines when it organised its latest bash. Taking place in London on Wednesday, the event, entitled \u201cTaxing the top: what history tells us about when and why it happens\u201d, marks the launch of a book on taxing the rich by US economist David Stasavage. Other speakers will include Paul Johnson, director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies. Topics covered in the evening will include: \u201cDo the richest in society need to pay more, or are they already sharing an unfair burden of the UK\u2019s declining tax base?\u201d (No and yes would seem to be the likely answers from the Panamanian offshore brigade, to judge from the recent revelations.) Stasavage argues that those at the very top are paying a lower effective rate of tax than the merely well-off, and that this goes against basic principles of equality and fairness. Perhaps it\u2019s something David Cameron and George Osborne might be interested to pop along and listen to. Brexit casts a shadow over outlook for Hays One effect of the uncertainty surrounding the EU referendum is that UK employers are more cautious about taking on full-time staff. A survey from Markit and the Recruitment and Employment Confederation found the number of people placed in permanent jobs rose at its slowest pace for six months in March. Instead, firms are hiring more temporary workers, which is good news for recruitment group Hays since it has a lower exposure to permanent jobs than some of its peers. Even so the company faces a challenging outlook, with slowing growth in the UK and Australia and only Europe outperforming \u2013 in particular Germany, where net fees grew by 14% in the second quarter. Barclays analysts expect total net fees for the third quarter, to be reported on Thursday, to grow by 3.3%. But they added: \u201cSlowing growth in the UK has been the biggest disappointment of the past 18 months and it is likely to get worse before it gets better, given uncertainty related to the EU referendum. After five quarters of growth, Australia is now on a downward trajectory, and, while the latest employment data was reassuring, the economy\u2019s close links to China mean uncertainty is high....And were Germany to come under significant pressure (we do already forecast growth reduces to 7% in the second half) it would be negative for the shares.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The ghost of 1930s protectionism is looming over the International Monetary Fund (IMF) as the Washington-based organisation prepares for its half-yearly meeting on Friday. Ever since the financial crisis led to the biggest global downturn since the Great Depression, finance ministers and central bank governors have comforted themselves with the knowledge that they have avoided the mistakes made eight decades ago. Back then, tariffs were raised to keep out foreign imports in a series of beggar-thy-neighbour moves designed to safeguard jobs and domestic output. Currency devaluations as countries came off the gold standard simply added to the protectionist pressure. The creation of the IMF at the Bretton Woods conference in 1944 was, in large part, an effort to avoid a repeat of the 1930s. Capital controls gave countries an opportunity to pursue full employment goals without fear of speculative attacks on their currencies, but at the same time they were expected to remove the barriers to trade erected during the Great Depression. This was done through a series of trade negotiations that, from the late 1940s, gradually lowered tariffs on manufactured goods. But the last round of global talks \u2013 in Uruguay \u2013 was completed more than 22 years ago, and it proved impossible to broker a new all-embracing deal even before the shock caused by the collapse of Lehman Brothers. Since then, a number of things have happened. The idea of a global deal was finally abandoned 14 years after the talks began in Doha in 2001. Growth in world trade has slowed, markedly and protractedly. The World Trade Organisation (WTO) said last week that it expected to see a fifth successive year of sub-3% trade growth in 2016. At the same time, protectionism has increased. Between them, the G20 group of countries have imposed more than 3,500 trade-distorting measures since the crisis began, 80% of which remain in force. A growing protectionist mood in the world\u2019s biggest economy has been highlighted by the US presidential campaign. Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders have both argued that American workers will lose as a result of the trade deals Barack Obama has been negotiating with a group of Asian countries and the European Union. The White House has also become more interventionist. It has strengthened safeguards to prevent the dumping of Chinese steel at below world market prices and last week Barack Obama moved to stop multinationals avoiding tax by relocating their HQs. It\u2019s not hard to find an explanation for all this. Growth rates have been sluggish despite the unprecedented amount of monetary stimulus provided by central banks through ultra-low (and now, in some cases, negative) interest rates and quantitative easing. Living standards have remained under pressure in the west, making electorates distrustful of their leaders. The other new factor is the slowdown in China, which has left the country with excessive industrial capacity. Faced with the choice between closing down loss-making steel plants or keeping them open by offloading output on to an already saturated global market, Beijing has chosen the second option. It has responded to tougher US anti-dumping measures by increasing its own tariffs on imported steel. A major escalation of protectionism is now likely to manifest itself in two ways. First, the G20\u2019s commitment to refrain from competitive currency depreciations will come under increasing strain. The US, the EU and Japan all want their currencies to be cheaper. Second, a decision has to be made over whether China should be given market economy status under WTO rules. This change would make it harder for the west to take anti-dumping action. A decision has to be taken by the end of the year, and Beijing expects to get what it wants. In the current circumstances that looks unlikely. Big trouble lies ahead. The pay cut\u2019s clever: but Co-op\u2019s boss won\u2019t be short of pennies Two years ago, the Observer broke the story about extraordinary executive pay deals on offer from the Co-operative Group. At the time, the mutual was embroiled in a scandal in its banking arm, so the revelation that its newly appointed chief executive, Euan Sutherland, was to receive \u00a33.6m for his first year sparked something of a row. Sutherland lasted barely 48 hours, quitting with a parting shot in which he described the 170-year-old group as ungovernable. Roll on two years and his successor Richard Pennycook \u2013 who was hired by Sutherland as part of his turnaround team \u2013 announced he would take a \u00a3500,000 cut to his \u00a31.25m base salary, and reductions in potential bonuses. It was an astute move, given the protests at last year\u2019s annual meeting, where one in three of the votes cast didn\u2019t support the remuneration report. In 2013, the year Pennycock was hired, he received \u00a31.3m. In 2014, he got \u00a32.5m. Last year, a total of \u00a33.6m. Clearly it would be churlish not to applaud his decision to ask for a pay cut. But the applause, for now, is polite rather than deafening. The salary cut takes effect from July, and the cuts to the bonuses in 2017. So, for this year, Pennycook \u2013 who last year received \u00a342,000 to enable him to stay close to his workplace during the working week \u2013 can still expect pay of more than \u00a33m. At least the cut sets a better starting point for negotiations with potential successors. After all, by this time next year, Pennycook will have been at the Co-op for four years. Few believe he ever aspired to the top job: he was hired as finance director and expected to become chief operating officer. A highly regarded turnaround specialist, he has put the group on firmer financial footing and already has board positions at housebuilder Persimmon, kitchen company Howden Joinery and sunglasses company The Hut. If the job is becoming more day-to-day and less about solving the crisis, he may get restless. Then the test for the Co-op will be avoiding pay inflation. Rowe may be cut from the right cloth All hail the new saviour of Marks &amp; Spencer. Steve Rowe, M&amp;S\u2019s new chief executive, stepped up to take a bow in front of the City last week. He made the right noises: promising to listen to customers, make the clothes more stylish and even cut prices. Sound familiar? A formula to turn around M&amp;S\u2019s struggling clothing business is the holy grail of British retailing. In Rowe\u2019s favour is his knowledge of how M&amp;S actually works. His predecessor, Marc Bolland, appeared remote from the rank and file whereas Rowe, who has climbed from Saturday boy to the boardroom, knows what they think of HQ in the stores \u2013 and vice versa. He needs to unlock the potential of both. He is a popular and well-regarded figure internally and among City scribes, but the decisions he will have to take to shake up M&amp;S will be tough \u2013 and unpopular.",

At the time, the mutual was embroiled in a scandal in its banking arm, so the revelation that its newly appointed chief executive, Euan Sutherland, was to receive \u00a33.6m for his first year sparked something of a row. Sutherland lasted barely 48 hours, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/mar/08/new-co-op-storm-pay-deals\" title=\"\">quitting with a parting shot</a> in which he described the 170-year-old group as ungovernable.</p> <p>Roll on two years and his successor Richard Pennycook \u2013 who was hired by Sutherland as part of his turnaround team \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/apr/07/co-op-chief-pay-cut-2017-richard-pennycook\" title=\"\">announced he would take a \u00a3500,000 cut to his \u00a31.25m base salary</a>, and reductions in potential bonuses.</p> <p>It was an astute move, given the protests at last year\u2019s annual meeting, where one in three of the votes cast didn\u2019t support the remuneration report. In 2013, the year Pennycock was hired, he received \u00a31.3m. In 2014, he got \u00a32.5m. Last year, a total of \u00a33.6m.</p> <p>Clearly it would be churlish not to applaud his decision to ask for a pay cut. But the applause, for now, is polite rather than deafening. The salary cut takes effect from July, and the cuts to the bonuses in 2017. So, for this year, Pennycook \u2013 who last year received \u00a342,000 to enable him to stay close to his workplace during the working week \u2013 can still expect pay of more than \u00a33m.</p> <p>At least the cut sets a better starting point for negotiations with potential successors. After all, by this time next year, Pennycook will have been at the Co-op for four years. Few believe he ever aspired to the top job: he was hired as finance director and expected to become chief operating officer. A highly regarded turnaround specialist, he has put the group on firmer financial footing and already has board positions at housebuilder Persimmon, kitchen company Howden Joinery and sunglasses company The Hut.</p> <p>If the job is becoming more day-to-day and less about solving the crisis, he may get restless. Then the test for the Co-op will be avoiding pay inflation.</p> <h2>Rowe may be cut from the right cloth</h2> <p>All hail the new saviour of Marks &amp; Spencer. Steve Rowe, M&amp;S\u2019s new chief executive, stepped up to take a bow in front of the City last week. He <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/apr/04/m-and-s-steve-rowe-control-clothing-division\" title=\"\">made the right noises</a>: promising to listen to customers, make the clothes more stylish and even cut prices. Sound familiar? A formula to turn around M&amp;S\u2019s struggling clothing business is the holy grail of British retailing.</p> <p>In Rowe\u2019s favour is his knowledge of how M&amp;S actually works. His predecessor, Marc Bolland, appeared remote from the rank and file whereas Rowe, who has climbed from Saturday boy to the boardroom, knows what they think of HQ in the stores \u2013 and vice versa. He needs to unlock the potential of both.</p> <p>He is a popular and well-regarded figure internally and among City scribes, but the decisions he will have to take to shake up M&amp;S will be tough \u2013 and unpopular.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The ability of chickens to stay warm in winter has inspired a new energy-efficient home insulation product developed by students at Imperial College London. Around 900m chickens are slaughtered each year by the poultry industry, producing 2,000 tonnes of feather waste a week, most of which ends up in landfill or goes through an energy-intensive process to be made into animal feed. But what else could be done with it? As part of her research into potential uses for feather waste, design engineering student Elena Dieckmann ordered a 10kg box of excess feathers from about 70 chickens. At first, she had no idea what they might be used for, but soon the answer became obvious: in the same way that feathers protect chickens from the cold, they can keep people\u2019s homes warm. Dieckmann and two fellow students \u2013 chemical engineer Ioannis Tzouganatos and biologist Ryan Robinson \u2013 are now developing a method to mix chicken feathers with the foam used in home insulation boards. They want to create a potentially cheaper \u2013 and greener \u2013 home insulation alternative. The students teamed up after being tasked with finding a suitable use for the feathers by Imperial College\u2019s Professor Chris Cheeseman. \u201cFeathers are made for protecting chickens or birds from water and cold. This is what we are targeting to replicate in our product, FeatherFill \u2013 to use these properties to create better insulating material,\u201d says Tzouganatos. \u201cWe thought about what feathers are good for \u2013 there is obviously a lot of inspiration from nature,\u201d says Robinson. \u201cIt was a very experimental approach,\u201d adds Dieckmann. \u201cCan we use the amazing properties of feathers in another material? It\u2019s obvious now that insulation would make sense, because [the feathers were] air-trapping.\u201d The result of their research is a way to replace some of the polyurethane foam contained in boards commonly used in home insulation. Substituting blended feathers for about 30% of the foam produces a cheaper material with similar heat-retention qualities. It provides a use for the unwanted feathers, creating a circular economy. The feathers are blended with the foam to create a material with consistent properties. Feathers that do not end up in landfill are typically used to produce animal feed called feather meal. The students used probes to measure the thermal conductivity of the new material \u2013 how effectively heat passes through it \u2013 and found it had similar values to other products on the market. Dieckmann says that by replacing 30% of the synthetic materials in the foam with ground feathers, the same effect could be achieved at a lower cost. The price of the foam was 14 times that of the processed feathers, she says. Adding more feathers does not automatically result in a more effective product, however. \u201cThe thing is, when you are making the foam, it is at first at liquid state and then it rises. But if you put too many solids in it, then it just does not rise, so you don\u2019t end up with a foam \u2013 you just end up with something like cement,\u201d says Tzouganatos. \u201cYou have to find the optimum window.\u201d A final product, possibly a foam board, could be ready within months; the students say that the fundamentals of their creation are sound, although they are still working on improvements. Tests will be carried out for mould resistance and flammability. Because the raw material is cheap, the new product could lower the cost of insulation for homeowners, Robinson says. \u201cThe problem is, especially in London, that a lot of our houses are quite old and so they don\u2019t have proper insulation in them. So we are wasting money and energy.\u201d Ideally all houses should be insulated, but there are a number of barriers to that including cost, awareness and the lack of government incentives. \u201cWe are hoping that by reusing a waste product, you can lower the cost instead of having to process all of these extra materials,\u201d says Robinson. The vast majority of the 2,000 tonnes of poultry feathers produced each week are from chickens, and slaughterhouses pay \u00a363 per tonne to dispose of them, Robinson says. The industry is therefore looking for commercial and environmental alternatives to the current system. \u201cThey are already paying to get rid of them, so they might just pay us less,\u201d he says. The students recently won \u00a320,000 of funding for the idea from the 2016 Mayor of London\u2019s Low Carbon Entrepreneur competition. They also want to examine whether the product could be used as a flexible foam that is pumped into wall cavities. Among the trials and errors that got the group to FeatherFill was an attempt to make a lightweight cement. The idea that some people might be squeamish about having chicken feathers in their walls or roofs does not concern them, however. \u201cWe don\u2019t know why someone would say that. You wouldn\u2019t see it, you wouldn\u2019t smell it. It is not that we slaughtered the chicken to make the foam. They are already slaughtered and we just utilise the feathers, so we are not really concerned about it,\u201d says Tzouganatos. \u2022You can read our archive of Innovators columns on the Big Innovation Centre website, where you will find more information on how the centre supports innovative enterprise in Britain and elsewhere.",

      "bodyText": "Households in England can look forward to a 14-page booklet landing on their doormat this week, making the case for Britain\u2019s remaining in the EU. Responding to criticism of the \u00a39m publicity drive, which will eventually reach the whole of the UK, the government said a survey had shown that 85% of people wanted more facts about the referendum. If it is facts we get, fair enough. Voters are being asked to decide on something that until recently they knew little about, and probably cared even less. Now, with less than three months to go to the poll, it\u2019s little surprise people want a crash course in the pros and cons of EU membership. Understandably, many simply want to know whether they will be better or worse off if we leave. And that\u2019s where the \u201cdismal science\u201d steps in. But should it? Economics is seen as a great simplifier, and we all love simplicity when faced with a decision. Wouldn\u2019t it be nice if economists could plug some numbers into a spreadsheet and come out with a cold, hard figure: how much Brexit might cost, or benefit, the UK? Plenty of economists have tried, and their calculations have been lapped up by the media and campaigners alike. Analysts at investment bank Credit Suisse say a vote to leave the EU would trigger a snap UK recession, prompt a fall in share prices and house prices and knock as much as 2% off GDP. BlackRock, the world\u2019s largest fund manager, has warned about potential losses to the exchequer if the financial industry is depleted by Brexit. If 10% of workers in financial services lost their jobs after a vote to leave, it says, the government could lose up to \u00a33bn in annual employment taxes. The CBI has gone further, seeking to pinpoint what each household would lose. Analysis it commissioned from accountant PricewaterhouseCoopers claimed that Brexit would cause a serious shock to the UK economy that could lead to 950,000 job losses and leave the average household as much as \u00a33,700 worse off by 2020. PwC examined two exit scenarios: one at the optimistic end of the range, and the other assuming difficult trade negotiations that eventually result in trade deals being concluded. It also said that much more pessimistic scenarios could be envisaged. And therein lies the problem. No accountant or economist can tell voters what trade deals would be negotiated in the event of a vote to leave. Nor can they tell us what immigration rules will be hammered out, which international firms will leave Britain or how UK government bonds will fare on international markets. Economists themselves would probably admit as much, given the chance. After all, devotees of this discipline are passionate about probability distribution tables and many-hued fan charts that map out potential outcomes. Robert Chote, chair of the government\u2019s forecaster, the Office for Budget Responsibility, has in the past used a fan chart in tones of red and orange to show likely it thought the government was to meet its fiscal rule: Chote called it \u201cthe flamethrower of uncertainty\u201d. Harry Truman famously summed up his frustrations with wishy-washy advisers when he reportedly exclaimed: \u201cGive me a one-handed economist. All my economists say, \u2018on the one hand \u2026 on the other\u2019.\u201d Yet still we turn to economists for answers, making oracles of people who can\u2019t even agree on what the UK\u2019s trend rate of growth is, who can\u2019t predict what inflation will be from one month to the next \u2013 and who largely failed to predict the biggest financial crisis in living memory. Much as voters and politicians would like economics to be an objective way of quantifying the effects of staying in or leaving the EU, it is not. There is a second problem with taking a purely economic approach to the Brexit debate: it tends to focus on the short term. But if people really believe the UK should not, for whatever reason, be part of the EU, they should accept some short-term disruption from a decision to leave. Similarly, those who want to stay but worry about how much the UK pays to Brussels must accept that being part of the EU comes at a price. The decision cannot be based merely on near-term profit or loss. Take the example of German reunification in 1990. Marrying two countries with vastly different productivity levels, work cultures and politics made little economic sense. The same went for the one-for-one exchange rate for ostmarks and deutschmarks. But it wasn\u2019t about the economics \u2013 reunification was about history and politics. As former chancellor Willy Brandt put it: \u201cWhat belongs together, will grow together.\u201d More than a quarter of a century down the line, Germany is still growing together, the economies of east and west still struggling to run to the same rhythm. But that does not make reunification a mistake. One thing that Remain campaigners are right about is that leaving the EU would be a \u201cleap in the dark\u201d. Or as Airbus executives told staff in a letter warning against Brexit: \u201cWe simply don\u2019t know what \u2018out\u2019 looks like.\u201d No country has ever left the bloc. That puts the onus on Leave campaigners to come up with more than reassurances that it will all be OK. But those on the other side do themselves and the dismal science few favours by bandying around flaky figures.",

      "body": "<p>Households in England can look forward to a 14-page booklet landing on their doormat this week, making the case for Britain\u2019s remaining in the EU. Responding to criticism of the \u00a39m publicity drive, which will eventually reach the whole of the UK, the government said a survey had shown that 85% of people wanted more facts about the referendum.</p> <p>If it is facts we get, fair enough. Voters are being asked to decide on something that until recently they knew little about, and probably cared even less. Now, with less than three months to go to the poll, it\u2019s little surprise people want a crash course in the pros and cons of EU membership. Understandably, many simply want to know whether they will be better or worse off if we leave.</p> <p>And that\u2019s where the \u201cdismal science\u201d steps in. But should it? Economics is seen as a great simplifier, and we all love simplicity when faced with a decision. Wouldn\u2019t it be nice if economists could plug some numbers into a spreadsheet and come out with a cold, hard figure: how much Brexit might cost, or benefit, the UK?</p> <p>Plenty of economists have tried, and their calculations have been lapped up by the media and campaigners alike.</p> <p>Analysts at investment bank Credit Suisse say a vote to leave the EU <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jan/25/brexit-would-trigger-economic-financial-shock-for-uk\" title=\"\">would trigger a snap UK recession</a>, prompt a fall in share prices and house prices and knock as much as 2% off GDP.</p> <p>BlackRock, the world\u2019s largest fund manager, has <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/mar/02/brexit-damage-uk-economy-blackrock\" title=\"\">warned about potential losses to the exchequer if the financial industry is depleted by Brexit</a>. If 10% of workers in financial services lost their jobs after a vote to leave, it says, the government could lose up to \u00a33bn in annual employment taxes.</p> <p>The CBI has gone further, seeking to pinpoint what each household would lose. Analysis it commissioned from accountant PricewaterhouseCoopers <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/mar/21/brexit-could-cost-100bn-and-nearly-1m-jobs-cbi-warns\" title=\"\">claimed that Brexit would cause a serious shock to the UK economy</a> that could lead to 950,000 job losses and leave the average household as much as \u00a33,700 worse off by 2020.</p> <p>PwC examined two exit scenarios: one at the optimistic end of the range, and the other assuming difficult trade negotiations that eventually result in trade deals being concluded. It also said that much more pessimistic scenarios could be envisaged.</p> <p>And therein lies the problem. No accountant or economist can tell voters what trade deals would be negotiated in the event of a vote to leave. Nor can they tell us what immigration rules will be hammered out, which international firms will leave Britain or how UK government bonds will fare on international markets.</p> <p>Economists themselves would probably admit as much, given the chance. After all, devotees of this discipline are passionate about probability distribution tables and many-hued fan charts that map out potential outcomes. Robert Chote, chair of the government\u2019s forecaster, the Office for Budget Responsibility, has in the past used <a href=\"https://twitter.com/KatieAllenGdn/status/540166869677006848\" title=\"\">a fan chart in tones of red and orange</a> to show likely it thought the government was to meet its fiscal rule: Chote called it \u201cthe flamethrower of uncertainty\u201d.</p> <p>Harry Truman famously summed up his frustrations with wishy-washy advisers when he reportedly exclaimed: \u201cGive me a one-handed economist. All my economists say, \u2018on the one hand \u2026 on the other\u2019.\u201d</p> <p>Yet still we turn to economists for answers, making oracles of people who can\u2019t even agree on what the UK\u2019s trend rate of growth is, who can\u2019t predict what inflation will be from one month to the next \u2013 and who largely failed to predict the biggest financial crisis in living memory. Much as voters and politicians would like economics to be an objective way of quantifying the effects of staying in or leaving the EU, it is not.</p> <p>There is a second problem with taking a purely economic approach to the Brexit debate: it tends to focus on the short term. But if people really believe the UK should not, for whatever reason, be part of the EU, they should accept some short-term disruption from a decision to leave.</p> <p>Similarly, those who want to stay but worry about how much the UK pays to Brussels must accept that being part of the EU comes at a price. The decision cannot be based merely on near-term profit or loss.</p> <p>Take the example of German reunification in 1990. Marrying two countries with vastly different productivity levels, work cultures and politics made little economic sense. The same went for the one-for-one exchange rate for ostmarks and deutschmarks. But it wasn\u2019t about the economics \u2013 reunification was about history and politics. As former chancellor Willy Brandt put it: \u201cWhat belongs together, will grow together.\u201d More than a quarter of a century down the line, Germany is still growing together, the economies of east and west still struggling to run to the same rhythm. But that does not make reunification a mistake.</p> <p>One thing that Remain campaigners are right about is that leaving the EU would be a \u201cleap in the dark\u201d. Or as <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/apr/04/airbus-executives-brexit-warning-letter-uk-eu\" title=\"\">Airbus executives told staff in a letter warning against Brexit</a>: \u201cWe simply don\u2019t know what \u2018out\u2019 looks like.\u201d</p> <p>No country has ever left the bloc. That puts the onus on Leave campaigners to come up with more than reassurances that it will all be OK. But those on the other side do themselves and the dismal science few favours by bandying around flaky figures.</p>",
