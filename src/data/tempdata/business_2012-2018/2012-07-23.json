      "bodyText": "Taxpayers are being handed an extra \u00a3538m from Virgin Money after Sir Richard Branson's money empire bought up another tranche of Northern Rock mortgages. The extra payments come in two tranches and are in addition to the \u00a3747m Virgin paid to take control of the \"good\" part of Northern Rock on 1 January this year. The \u00a3538m comprises an additional payment of \u00a373m under the terms of that original transaction while an extra \u00a3465m is being handed over for an additional tranche of mortgages being sold by UK Asset Resolution (UKAR), the body set up to look after the \"bad\" part of Northern Rock as well as Bradford &amp; Bingley mortgages.

Another \u00a380m could be received on a possible flotation in the next five years. With regards to the new mortgages being bought, Jayne-Anne Gadhia, chief executive of Virgin Money, described the deal as \"an excellent acquisition\".

      "body": "<p>Property developer Hammerson, which owns London's Brent Cross and Birmingham's Bullring, is forging ahead with new shopping centres in the UK and France and has signed up John Lewis as an anchor tenant for its planned mall in Leeds.</p> <p>The company sold the bulk of its portfolio of London offices for \u00a3518m to Canada's Brookfield last month to focus on retail. It used some of the cash to invest an additional \u00a3100m in nine designer outlets, including Bicester Village near Oxford, through its holding in Value Retail. Hammerson also secured French department store Printemps as an anchor tenant for its shopping centre at <a href=\"http://www.terrasses-du-port.fr/\" title=\"\">Les Terrasses du Port</a> in Marseille, which is due to open in the spring of 2014. Nearly three-quarters of the 61,000 sq metre centre are now pre-let.</p> <p>Footfall at the group's UK shopping centres dropped 2% in the first half of the year, and 3.3% at its French malls. David Atkins, Hammerson's chief executive, said: \"That's no real surprise against the general economic backdrop. But it's not all bad news - leisure, footware, jewellery and beauty have done well. The one area of real weakness was ladies' fashion and with the sun shining [now] there is every prospect of a bounce.\"</p> <p>Occupancy levels have improved to 97.5%. The company's net rental income rose by 2.4% to \u00a3141.6m in the first half of the year, and its net asset value increased 0.9% to 535p a share. Hammerson was one of few risers on the FTSE 100 index earlier in the day but the shares closed down 3.7p at 457.3p, with no gainers on the bluechip index at closing time.</p> <p>The Olympics could provide a small boost across the country by way of a feelgood factor - \"depending on how well we do\" although in London, people might find other things to do than go shopping, or even go away to avoid the crowds. Atkins pointed to a slight dip during the Jubilee weekend when people were out to celebrate, but not necessarily hitting the shops.</p> <p>Even so, he is optimistic. Hammerson's new schemes in places like Marseille and Newcastle are expected to boost income growth to 15% in the next three years, 5% a year. \"We will continue to grow our dividend by a similar amount,\" Atkins said.</p> <p>Construction at Eastgate Quarters in Leeds city centre, where Hammerson is building a 36,000 sq metre mall, will start early in 2014 and the centre is scheduled to open two years later. It's a rival development to <a href=\"http://www.trinityleeds.com/the-scheme#\" title=\"\">Land Securities' Trinity Leeds</a>, which is almost three times the size and is due to open next spring, also in the city centre.</p> <p>Atkins said the two will be able to exist side by side, with Hammerson looking to fill its two arcades with mid-to-upmarket retailers while Trinity Leeds will have more \"mass market\" retailers.</p> <p>Hammerson has started a string of other retail developments, such as Manor Walks in Cramlington and Monumental Mall in Newcastle, which will both open next year, and is planning a major extension of Brent Cross, adding up to 65,000 sq metres of shops.</p> <p>In Croydon, Hammerson faces a tough battle with Australian developer Westfield, which is plotting its third major mall around London. The majority leaseholders of the Whitgift centre have chosen Hammerson as their preferred development partner, but Westfield has the backing of the Whitgift Foundation, which owns the freehold. Hammerson wants to merge Whitgift with its Centrale mall and will on Friday unveil its master plan for 140,000 sq metres of retail space in the town centre after meeting with the council.</p> <p>Hammerson owns 19 shopping centres (11 in the UK), including Cabot Circus in Bristol and the Oracle in Reading, as well as 18 retail parks (17 in the UK).</p>",

It used some of the cash to invest an additional \u00a3100m in nine designer outlets, including Bicester Village near Oxford, through its holding in Value Retail. Hammerson also secured French department store Printemps as an anchor tenant for its shopping centre at Les Terrasses du Port in Marseille, which is due to open in the spring of 2014. Nearly three-quarters of the 61,000 sq metre centre are now pre-let. Footfall at the group's UK shopping centres dropped 2% in the first half of the year, and 3.3% at its French malls. David Atkins, Hammerson's chief executive, said: \"That's no real surprise against the general economic backdrop. But it's not all bad news - leisure, footware, jewellery and beauty have done well. The one area of real weakness was ladies' fashion and with the sun shining [now] there is every prospect of a bounce.\" Occupancy levels have improved to 97.5%. The company's net rental income rose by 2.4% to \u00a3141.6m in the first half of the year, and its net asset value increased 0.9% to 535p a share. Hammerson was one of few risers on the FTSE 100 index earlier in the day but the shares closed down 3.7p at 457.3p, with no gainers on the bluechip index at closing time. The Olympics could provide a small boost across the country by way of a feelgood factor - \"depending on how well we do\" although in London, people might find other things to do than go shopping, or even go away to avoid the crowds. Atkins pointed to a slight dip during the Jubilee weekend when people were out to celebrate, but not necessarily hitting the shops. Even so, he is optimistic. Hammerson's new schemes in places like Marseille and Newcastle are expected to boost income growth to 15% in the next three years, 5% a year. \"We will continue to grow our dividend by a similar amount,\" Atkins said. Construction at Eastgate Quarters in Leeds city centre, where Hammerson is building a 36,000 sq metre mall, will start early in 2014 and the centre is scheduled to open two years later. It's a rival development to Land Securities' Trinity Leeds, which is almost three times the size and is due to open next spring, also in the city centre. Atkins said the two will be able to exist side by side, with Hammerson looking to fill its two arcades with mid-to-upmarket retailers while Trinity Leeds will have more \"mass market\" retailers. Hammerson has started a string of other retail developments, such as Manor Walks in Cramlington and Monumental Mall in Newcastle, which will both open next year, and is planning a major extension of Brent Cross, adding up to 65,000 sq metres of shops. In Croydon, Hammerson faces a tough battle with Australian developer Westfield, which is plotting its third major mall around London. The majority leaseholders of the Whitgift centre have chosen Hammerson as their preferred development partner, but Westfield has the backing of the Whitgift Foundation, which owns the freehold. Hammerson wants to merge Whitgift with its Centrale mall and will on Friday unveil its master plan for 140,000 sq metres of retail space in the town centre after meeting with the council. Hammerson owns 19 shopping centres (11 in the UK), including Cabot Circus in Bristol and the Oracle in Reading, as well as 18 retail parks (17 in the UK).",

      "bodyText": "Dairy farmers embroiled in a bitter dispute that has seen them blockading major UK milk processing plants reached a \"significant\" agreement on Monday in their battle over low milk prices. In a draft deal, brokered by the government at a crisis summit, broad principles for a voluntary code of conduct were drawn up aimed at giving farmers more bargaining power.

      "bodyText": "Policy in Europe is all about playing for time. The big picture ideas for saving the single currency will take years, not months, to come to fruition - but the threat of collapse is immediate. So the short-term mindset is all about survival: think the football team that parks the bus in order to defend a 0-0 scoreline or the batsmen whose sole aim is to occupy the crease when their team is facing an innings defeat on the last day of a Test match. For a while last week, there was the real prospect that Europe's backs to the wall effort had succeeded. Last month's summit had more substance than the previous content-free affairs, and the rally in European financial markets last week reflected the belief that enough had been done to keep things calm through August. That, though, was until the Spanish region of Valencia announced that it needed financial help from Madrid, providing the trigger for a big sell-off in the markets that continued on Monday. The response from the Spanish government was to swear blind one minute that there was not the remotest possibility of a full-blown rescue involving the International Monetary Fund and to impose a ban on the short selling of shares the next. The markets were suitably unimpressed by this display of ineptitude. Meanwhile, Greece was once again coming under the spotlight as Athens awaited the arrival of officials from the Troika (the IMF, the European Central Bank and the European Union) on Tuesday. Greece is gripped by a 1930s-style depression and, perhaps unsurprisingly, is having trouble sticking to the austerity programme imposed as part of its bailout. It appears that the troika will threaten to cut off Greece's financial lifeline unless the coalition government agrees to an extra \u20ac2bn of cuts. There are three conclusions to be drawn from these events. The first is that Spain is heading inexorably towards a bailout, probably quite soon. It was always a case of smoke and mirrors to imagine that the promised \u20ac100bn (\u00a378bn) package of support for Spanish banks would be enough and so it has proved. This is a country with a collapsing economy, an imploding property market, banks nursing colossal losses, and 10-year bond yields at 7.5%. The question is not whether there will be a bailout, but how big it will be. At least \u20ac300bn in all probability. The second conclusion is that the trapdoor is opening up under Greece. German patience with Athens has run out, and the IMF was forced to deny reports on Monday it was preparing to cut off financial support. The Greek government is now faced with the choice of agreeing to a new range of demand-reducing measures it knows will be both counter-productive and politically toxic in order to be able to pay its bills inside the euro zone, or to devalue and default outside monetary union. A voluntary Greek exit would be ideal for Angela Merkel. What links Greece and Spain is that the failed approach that has brought the smaller of the two countries to the point of no return is now being tried with the bigger and more strategically important member of the club. The lesson from Greece is absolutely clear: slashing spending and increasing taxes when an economy is in free fall leads to higher, not lower, levels of debt. Spain is following Greece down the vicious spiral that starts with weak growth and rising unemployment and ends with expensive bail outs that do more harm than good. For Greece in August 2011 read Spain in August 2012. Same problems. Same failed answers. Same crisis. Only bigger.",

      "bodyText": "McDonald's, the fast food giant that managed to ride out much of the Great Recession, has been bitten by the global slowdown. The world's largest hamburger chain said Monday that its net income fell 4% in the second quarter as the dollar strengthened against global currencies. Same store sales have also begun to slow as austerity measures take their toll in Europe and China's economy slows. The news was a rare slip for McDonald's, which has consistently beaten analysts expectations in recent years, and a worrying sign of trouble in the global economy. The news contributed to a sell-off in the Dow Jones index. McDonald's figures came as Coca-Cola Enterprises - Coke's US-listed European bottling business - reported a similar hit from slowing demand and a strengthening dollar and other problems linked to the bad weather in Europe and a French tax on fizzy drinks. Same-store sales at McDonald's - sales at restaurants open at least 13 months - rose 3.7% globally in the second quarter. The figure is the key measure for restaurant chains and the rise beat most analysts' expectatioxn. But it was a sharp slowdown from the 7.3% increase McDonald's reported in the first quarter of 2012 and the 5.6% growth the company reported for the same quarter last year. Net income for the second quarter was $1.3bn down from $1.4bn a year earlier. \"McDonald's global comparable sales remained solid for the quarter while overall results reflected the slowing global economy, persistent economic headwinds and the investments we've made to enhance restaurant operations and provide customers the everyday value they have come to expect from McDonald's,\" said Don Thompson, McDonald's newly appointed chief executive officer. \"As we begin the third quarter, global comparable sales for July are expected to be positive, but less than second quarter,\" he said. Sales in the US grew 3.6% for the quarter and in Europe sales grew 3.8% - held up by sales in the UK and Russia. Sales in the once fast growing Asia/Pacific, Middle East and Africa were almost flat at 0.9% for the quarter. Solid performances in Australia and China were offset by weakness in Japan. The results came as Coca-Cola Enterprises reported that its net income fell 17% in the second quarter and the company warned of more woes to come. John Brock, chairman and chief executive officer, said the company faced a \"unique combination of unfavorable weather and ongoing marketplace challenges\". He said bad weather in Europe had hit sales alongside slowing demand and a tax on sugary drinks in France. Western Europe's main Coke bottler earned $205m in the April-June quarter, compared with $246m a year earlier. Volume declined 6%, driven down by falls in sodas and non-carbonated beverages like juices and teas. Energy drinks volume rose 16% and Coke Zero, a soda without calories, rose 2.5%. Total volume fell less slowly in the UK, down 4.5%, than in continental Europe (including Norway and Sweden) where it fell 7%.",

Finally Tristel, the hygiene products group which supplies the veterinary market, jumped nearly 5% to 32p after reporting a better than expected performance since its profit warning in June. It has seen improved revenues after two new wholesalers took on its Anistel products, and now expects full year profits of more than \u00a3700,000, compared to the \u00a3650,000 it forecast in June.",

The business and investment world is either on holiday or distracted by the feast of sport. Those who remain at their desks are understandably obsessed by the fire in the eurozone and how to survive it. More chewy matters, such as how to reverse the dangerous decades-long drift away from long-term perspectives in equity markets, will struggle to be debated. There is a danger that the Kay Review will be left to gather dust. That would be a shame because Kay's list of 17 recommendations would represent a huge, and much-needed, cultural shakeup if adopted. Four stand out. First, the easy one \u2014 stopping the requirement for companies to report quarterly. Most of the extra information in three-month updates is not useful for measuring a company's real progress. These events have descended into a trading opportunity for the here-today-gone-tomorrow brigade with the effect that debate about long-term corporate strategies gets squashed. Second, an obvious one \u2014 a clear statement that managers of other people's money should have a fidicuary duty to act prudently in their clients' interests. This might sound wishy-washy but it is surely better than current arrangements which are injected with \"buyer beware\" get-out clauses. As Kay puts it: \"Caveat emptor is not a concept compatible with an equity investment chain based on trust and stewardship.\" Third, a radical one \u2014 ban short-term cash bonuses. What's the point of them? They didn't exist 20 years ago and, given that executives have to screw up royally to get no extra annual handout, they have become akin to a salary supplement. Kay's way is more sensible \u2014 any bonuses should be paid in shares and the required holding period should extend beyond the executive's tenure with the company. In other words: no reward for chasing short-term targets at the cost of a company's long-term strength. Boardroom Britain, one suspects would probably demand steep salary increases to \"compensate\" executives for the loss of annual cash bonuses, as happened with investment bank employees. The short answer to that, though, is let to matter be settled via open engagement between shareholders and boards. The former, armed with new powers of veto, ought to be able to make a stand if necessary. Fourth, the novel one \u2014 an investors' forum to allow long-term fund mangers to agree on how to confront errant companies. This doesn't happen naturally because individual managers fear falling foul of regulations designed to clamp down on concert parties. An approved forum would legitimise the processs. At Barclays today, for example, one might hope to hear a clear statement from leading shareholders about the need for an incoming chairman and chief executive to clean up the bank's culture. To the sceptics, the Kay report will read as a longing for a world that disappeared 20 years ago \u2014 one where the investment landscape was dominated by large fund managers with concentrated portfolios; where private investors were still a force; where index-tracking, and index-hugging, was a minority sport; where hedge funds and ultra high-frequency traders barely registered. There is indeed a strong sense that the horse has bolted. But that's hardly Kay's fault. He should not be blamed for pointing out simple truths, such as the fact that long-term decision making will lose out if chief executives are incentivised via schemes that pay out in cash during a term of office that tends to last about four years.",

      "bodyText": "Germany's finance minister, Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble, will meet his Spanish counterpart, Luis de Guindos, for crisis talks on Tuesday amid fears that spiralling bond yields in the eurozone's fourth biggest economy will force it to seek a \u20ac300bn bailout from the European Union and the International Monetary Fund. Interest rates on Spain's 10-year borrowing rose to 7.59% \u2013 the highest since the euro was created \u2013 and the stock market in Madrid fell by 5% in morning trading following fresh bad news about the financial health of the country's regions. Hints from politicians in Berlin that Germany is preparing the ground for Greece to leave the single currency also unsettled markets, with hefty falls in equity prices on European bonuses and the euro under pressure on the foreign exchanges. London's FTSE 100 index was down 100 points at midday, at 5551. Dealers were unimpressed by de Guindos's claim that Spain would not become the fourth eurozone country to require a formal bailout, after Murcia on Sunday became the second Spanish region to request financial assistance from the government. The Spanish finance minister categorically denied that a bailout was imminent, but media reports from Spain suggest up to six regions could require financial aid, with Catalonia next in line. \"What began as a Spanish banking bailout looks to be moving rather quickly towards a possible sovereign bailout. Overlay that with increasingly negative news on Greece and you get a fairly negative mix, so the path of least resistance for the euro is down,\" said Jeremy Stretch, currency strategist at CIBC. The cost of bailing out Spain would dwarf the packages already agreed for the three smaller eurozone countries \u2013 Greece, Ireland and Portugal \u2013 and would heap pressure on monetary union's third biggest economy Italy. Officials from the EU, the European Central Bank and the IMF arrive in Athens on Tuesday to push for new austerity measures in return for financial help, but a leading German conservative prompted renewed speculation of Greece leaving monetary union when he said the new coalition government headed by Antonis Samaras should start paying half of its pensions and state salaries in drachmas as part of a gradual exit. Alexander Dobrindt, general secretary of the Christian Social Union (CSU), the Bavaria-based sister party of Chancellor Angela Merkel's Christian Democrats (CDU), has long argued that Greece would be better off outside the eurozone. \"With Greece we have reached the end of the road. There must not be any further aid. A country which does not have the will to fulfil the conditions, or is not able to do so, must get a chance outside the euro,\" Dobrindt told the daily Die Welt.",

      "bodyText": "The Treasury will announce a crackdown on tax avoidance schemes on Monday in the wake of the row over the tax affairs of the comedian Jimmy Carr. Promoters of aggressive tax avoidance schemes may be forced to disclose client lists to inspectors, according to David Gauke, the minister with responsibility for tax matters. It follows revelations about the financial loopholes used by the rich and famous to legally sidestep large tax bills. In one scheme, Carr was paying 1% tax on his income. The plan, which is going out to consultation, has been greeted with scepticism by Labour. One shadow minister said the Tories were so closely associated with tax avoiders they would not have the political will necessary to change the tax system. Gauke will tell the Policy Exchange thinktank that scheme operators will be \"named and shamed\" for sharp practice. Officials often hit a dead end when investigating schemes that are based offshore but, under the proposals, UK promoters will be made to hand over customer databases. That information will be used to formally warn clients about the deals they have signed up to and to work out how much the amount of tax they would owe if the scheme failed. Under the reforms, a promoter who has been penalised for not complying with the rules will also have to provide extra information to HM Revenue &amp; Customs (HMRC) on all of their schemes, not just the one they were reprimanded for. Gauke will say: \"We are building on the work we have already done to make life difficult for those who artificially and aggressively reduce their tax bill. These schemes damage our ability to fund public services and provide support to those who need it. They harm businesses by distorting competition. They damage public confidence and they undermine the actions of the vast majority of taxpayers, who pay more in tax as a consequence of others enjoying a free ride.\" HMRC is also looking at formally requiring individuals, as well as firms, to comply with the rules, which would help it when a firm is dissolved or moved offshore, or an individual promoter moves from firm to firm. Last month, Carr found himself at the centre of criticism about K2, a legal scheme that allows its members to pay income tax of as little as 1%. Carr, 39, reportedly used the scheme to shelter \u00a33.3m a year, channelling money from DVD sales and television appearances into a company that gave him back \"loans\" which are not subject to tax. The comedian later apologised for his \"terrible error of judgment\" in using a tax avoidance scheme. Gauke's announcement at Policy Exchange comes a day after one of the thinktank's trustees was disclosed to have been involved in an aggressive tax avoidance scheme. The Mail on Sunday reported that Conservative donor George Robinson had been ordered to pay back millions of pounds in tax after a judge ruled against the tax scheme. Simon Danczuk, the Labour MP for Rochdale, said: \"It tells you everything you need to know about this government that ministers have chosen to give a speech on tax avoidance at an organisation whose trustee, the Conservative donor George Robinson, has just been found to have used an offshore avoidance scheme and had to pay back millions of pounds. \"With billions of pounds estimated to be lost each year, this government is failing to tackle tax avoidance, while also giving a tax cut to millionaires. How can it be fair to cut taxes for the very richest while ordinary families, pensioners and businesses are feeling the brunt of this double-dip recession?\" he said. Tax avoidance represents nearly 14% of the UK tax gap, according to the Treasury.",

      "bodyText": "The coalition government's economic strategy, intended to boost confidence and encourage investment, is having the opposite effect by deterring spending, a thinktank warned on Monday. The sluggish recovery from recession will see the UK's long-term GDP growth rate drop to just 1.7% by 2015 \u2013 its lowest level since the second world war and the equivalent of \u00a3165bn in lost output over 15 years \u2013 according to the Institute for Public Policy Research (IPPR). The report may well provide more food for thought for the chancellor, George Osborne, in advance of Wednesday's GDP figures which will show whether Britain lifted itself out of double-dip recession in the second quarter of 2012. At the weekend, Boris Johnson, the mayor of London, urged greater emphasis on growth and appeared to contradict David Cameron's warning that the crisis in the eurozone could last up to eight years. The International Monetary Fund has downgraded its forecast for UK growth to just 0.2% in 2012 and 1.4% in 2013. The thinktank said that there needs to be a change in fiscal policy, featuring temporary tax cuts, additional infrastructure spending and further quantitative easing to boost demand and bolster anaemic investment from the private sector. A two-year 2p cut in National Insurance would inject \u00a314bn into the economy and could be paid for by the introduction at a later date of a permanent mansion tax on homes worth more than \u00a32m, recommended the report. And the government could take advantage of historically low interest rates by borrowing \u00a330bn for investment in infrastructure at a cost of just \u00a3150 million a year. Using official statistics and Office for Budget Responsibility forecasts, the report calculated that by 2015 average growth over a 15-year period will have declined to 1.7%, compared to a historic average of 2.4% and a peak of almost 3.5% in the middle of the last decade. The report called on Osborne to ditch his plans to eliminate the national deficit within five years, and be prepared instead to increase borrowing in the short term and spread deficit reduction over a longer period. Rather than creating a favourable environment for business investment, as the chancellor claims, the IPPR said that the government's austerity measures have made companies and individuals reluctant to spend because of uncertainty about the future. The thinktank's chief economist, Tony Dolphin, said: \"The government should implement temporary tax cuts and a boost to infrastructure spending not offset by cuts elsewhere. This would mean borrowing more in the short term. \"Fears that more quantitative easing would increase the risk of higher inflation in coming years are misplaced.
