As the new CEO of Sir Robert McAlpine, I want to take the opportunity to share with you our commitment to ensuring that blacklisting stays firmly in the past. Since my arrival, it has been one of my priorities to review the company\u2019s HR and recruitment functions. I am pleased to confirm that Sir Robert McAlpine complies fully with all legislation to prevent blacklisting and is committed to fair and transparent recruitment. For the avoidance of doubt, I would also like to point out that we have no involvement with the Crossrail project. Blacklisting in construction was, until 2009, an industry-wide issue. Sir Robert McAlpine admitted and apologised for its involvement with the Consulting Association and amended its HR practices, policies and operations to ensure that it can never happen again. Following the ICO action in 2009 to close down the Consulting Association, Sir Robert McAlpine was a founding member of the Construction Workers Compensation Scheme, established to provide workers with easy access to compensation. We were one of only eight companies that settled the claims brought by the unions and other groups in the High Court. Sir Robert McAlpine, like all tendering contractors, is subject to significant and appropriate scrutiny before appointment to a project. Modern procurement practices carefully check all aspects of recruitment and employment to ensure that contractors comply fully with legislation and meet the standards required by the client. In turn, we carefully check the recruitment and employment practices of all our subcontractors to ensure they meet our own high standards.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The economic cost of Hurricane Irma could rise as high as $300bn (\u00a3227bn) as the storm lashes Florida, damaging homes, businesses and key crops including orange groves. Analysts said about $2tn of property lay in the storm\u2019s path, and also pointed to the potential impact on US food prices. Florida is the second-largest produce grower in the US and the world\u2019s second-largest producer of orange juice. Torsten Jeworrek, a member of the board of the German reinsurance giant Munich Re, said on Sunday that Irma was \u201ca major event for Florida and also a major event for the insurance industry\u201d. The hurricane has already unsettled the financial markets, sending insurance stocks falling and orange juice futures surging last week. The price of contracts for November deliveries of frozen orange juice concentrate spiked as investors feared the worst after the destruction Irma wrought in the Caribbean. Barrie Cornes, an analyst at the stockbroker Panmure Gordon, put the overall economic cost at $300bn, with insurance firms potentially on the hook for between $100bn and $150bn when the clean-up operation gets under way. Florida also grows other important crops including tomatoes, grapefruits, watermelons and sugar cane. Irma could wipe out as much as 20% of the state\u2019s citrus crop, a significant part of its economy, analysts have suggested. Alan Konn of the Chicago-based commodity trading firm Price Asset Management said: \u201cThe damage to the orange crop is twofold, both short-term disruption but also to the extent crops are completely destroyed.\u201d Irma could also have a longer-term impact because it takes a few years to grow an orange tree to production, which would limit supply for an extended period, he said in an interview on the financial website MarketWatch. The insurance industry is still assessing the cost of Hurricane Harvey, which caused severe flooding in parts of Texas last month. Initial estimates suggest the final bill could be as much as $100bn. That compares with economic damage of $176bn inflicted by Hurricane Katrina in 2005, which included $82bn of insured losses, according to the Swiss Re Institute. Risk modeller Chuck Watson of Enki Research said on Sunday afternoon that Irma looked \u2018pretty grim\u2019. \u201cDamage the roof of a million homes, which is possible in this storm, and the cost racks up pretty quick,\u201d Watson said. He fears that Florida\u2019s orange and grapefruit crop will probably be \u201cseverely damaged\u201d if the winds over the centre of the state, between Lake Okeechobee and Orlando, are as high as expected. The hurricane is \u201cbad news for the Florida insurance market, which is now dominated by smaller firms since the big national companies pulled out after the rash of storms in the mid 2000s,\u201d Watson added.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Television presenter Noel Edmonds says deep-pocketed investors are willing to bankroll his \u00a3300m compensation battle with Lloyds Banking Group. Edmonds\u2019 legal claim stems from the fraud scandal at the bank\u2019s HBOS Reading arm which affected more than 60 small business owners. In July, the former DJ and children\u2019s TV presenter upped his compensation demand from \u00a373m to \u00a3300m. \u201cI have a major litigation funder \u2026 who has seen my case so [Lloyds] can\u2019t beat me on deep pockets,\u201d Edmonds told the Mail on Sunday. Litigation funders provide financial backing to claimants they believe have a good chance of being awarded damages in a legal dispute. In return, the investors receive a fee or a percentage of any eventual settlement. The sum sought by Edmonds is three times the \u00a3100m pot Lloyds has set aside for customers affected by the fraud. The \u00a3300m is to cover losses relating to the collapse of the celebrity\u2019s entertainment firm Unique Group a decade ago, as well as the \u201cdistress\u201d and \u201cpublic humiliation\u201d he has suffered. Lloyds had denied there was any wrongdoing at its Reading branch until two of its former employees were convicted of fraud in February. A group of six bankers nicknamed \u201cBritain\u2019s Wolves of Wall Street\u201d were jailed for a combined 47 years and six months for their part in the \u00a3245m loans scam which destroyed several businesses. The jury heard the corrupt financiers spent the proceeds of their fraudulent activities on superyachts and sex parties. The scam took place between 2003 and 2007, predating Lloyds\u2019 rescue of HBOS during the financial crisis. Among those convicted was former HBOS banker Mark Dobson, who was sentenced to four and a half years in prison. Edmonds claims Dobson effectively became a shadow director of Unique. He also claims HBOS prevented him from selling shares in another business, UBC, so that he could repay a loan. Edmonds has led a high-profile campaign against Lloyds, admitting that he came close to taking his own life following the fraud. Two-thirds of the compensation figure is based on his estimate of what Unique could have been worth today, with the remainder to cover the loss of speaking engagements, the fire-sale of assets \u2013 including his vintage car collection and image rights \u2013 as well as the emotional toll of the episode. He told the Mail on Sunday that \u201cHBOS had robbed me of my marriage, my family, my businesses, my longstanding friend and business partner, my income, my investments, my self-respect, my reputation, my privacy, my physical and mental health. It cost me my security, my image rights, my collection of classic cars \u2013 and very nearly my life.\u201d After the fraud trial Lloyds set up a compensation scheme for the 64 victims. The bank says that 29 offers have now been made, and 14 have been accepted so far. In a statement Lloyds said: \u201cSince the end of the HBOS Reading fraud trial, we have been working hard to provide fair, swift and appropriate compensation. But, as we have met and spoken with victims, many have asked us for more time to provide input.\u201d It added: \u201cWe are committed to doing everything we can to support those affected \u2026 and we are continuing to make good progress in getting offers to the victims of the fraud.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The Bank of England governor, Mark Carney, needs to look no further than the pay of his own staff to figure out why \u2013 when he believes we\u2019re on the verge of a pay boom \u2013 most people\u2019s wage rises are stuck in first gear. The Bank swatted aside a dispute last week with low-paid staff that had become so toxic inside Threadneedle Street that even the pink-jacketed, top-hatted front-of-house greeters had joined their colleagues in the maintenance section and other blue-collar roles by downing tools. Carney had offered a 1% pay rise in line with the public sector pay cap. He took a tough line, even though the Bank is not seen as part of the public sector. And he held the line with only a few minor concessions. A little extra money was promised to a handful of the very lowest paid, a little extra holiday entitlement was also part of the modest package, and there was a pledge to include the union in future pay talks from the start. The 1% pay cap remains in place. And why wouldn\u2019t it when fewer than 100 of the Bank\u2019s 4,000 employees felt aggrieved enough to go on strike? They were angry enough to protest for three days before the dispute ran out of steam. A longer strike was never on the cards; it is a sad fact that workers have such little power in Britain today. The railway workers might use their muscle should they embark on a winter of disputes over driverless trains, but elsewhere workers face draconian employment laws that make them among the most flexible in the world when it comes to how and when they work. That\u2019s not how the Bank reads the broader economy. It disregards the dispute under its nose and believes that 3%-plus pay growth is around the corner. Listening to the speeches of some policymakers, anyone would think that with unemployment at a 40-year low of 4.4% in June, the workers would have taken their dispute to the wire and, without a more generous offer, quit for a better job elsewhere. The Bank\u2019s argument is that full employment, if not already here, is just around the corner. Take a look at London, which is supposedly in the grip of a skills shortage exacerbated by the departure of European migrants heading home. Employers are crying out for people and are poised to rip up their pay rates in favour of more generous salaries to secure the staff they need. With inflation expected to rise towards 3%, from 2.6% in July, workers need to see their pay packets following suit. In this scenario, a combination of few available workers and price rises in the shops will put huge pressure on employers to pay higher wages or risk unfilled vacancies. It is a message the monetary policy committee (MPC) is likely to repeat on Thursday when it makes its next judgment on the economy. The committee will most likely hold the base interest rate at 0.25% with the strong hint that a rise is imminent now that the labour market is tight and vacancies are rising. The Bank is not alone. Several City economists conclude that wages are about to jump now that the high level of vacancies is out of sync with the low level of unemployment. Kalum Pickering at Berenberg bank said: \u201cWe expect that by the end of the year, and certainly by the beginning of 2018, providing sterling doesn\u2019t take another major leg down, real wages will be rising again.\u201d To back up his point, wages across the economy have already started to rise from 1.6% per year at the beginning of the year to 2.1% in the latest figures. It will take a surge in wage rates to get past 3% to meet Pickering\u2019s forecast of inflation-busting pay rises, but as he points out, three months of improving pay growth shows it is going in the right direction. Yet, given the Bank of England strike\u2019s outcome, the central bank and its supporters in the City, at least as far as its analysis is concerned, seem completely out of touch. They seem to ignore the fact that the job market is stratified and regional and the answer to a chronic labour shortage is not necessarily higher pay. In the construction industry a shortage of specialist staff, which cannot be met by the current pool of skilled workers, has forced building firms to delay projects. Anecdotal evidence is that employers are not willing to take a cut in margins and customers are unwilling to pay more, so projects are mothballed. The Chartered Institute for Personnel and Development, which regularly talks to human resources directors across the private and public sectors, says the bottom end of the labour market continues to have a plentiful supply of workers. Its last survey showed there were an average of 24 applications for each low-skilled job, 19 candidates for every medium-skilled vacancy and eight for each high-skilled post. One factor was the continued influx of EU workers. It said: \u201cEU net migration levels remain well above post-enlargement average levels due to a continued strong supply of EU15 and Bulgarian and Romanian nationals. Initial fears that Brexit would have a material impact on employers\u2019 ability to fill vacancies therefore seem to be somewhat premature.\u201d Then there is the government\u2019s continuation of austerity, which will have the effect of making low income households even more desperate for a job, and when they have one, ask for longer hours just to make ends meet. Maybe Bank officials comfort themselves with the news that McDonald\u2019s workers have also struck for higher pay along with their own low-paid staff. But again it was just a smattering of staff who felt able to confront the restaurant chain \u2013 in line with the real trend, and not the Bank\u2019s fantasy projections, McDonald\u2019s has so far felt little anxiety about workers quitting for higher pay elsewhere. So the flexible market for labour remains firmly in place and pay increases are a pipe dream for most. It\u2019s why the archbishop of Canterbury joined the IPPR thinktank\u2019s commission on economic justice to say, among other things, that trade unions needed more support. \u201cWe are failing those who will grow up into a world where the gap between the richest and poorest parts of the country is significant and destabilising,\u201d Justin Welby said. The Bank, to maintain the obvious respect it still commands with Britons, could more helpfully give a more accurate picture of the economy. For this to happen, Carney and his fellow committee members need to get out more.",

      "bodyText": "Windfarms around Britain\u2019s coast will beat the planned nuclear power station Hinkley Point on price when the winning bidders for a \u00a3290m-a-year pot of government subsidies are announced on Monday, experts predict. Such a milestone would mark a dramatic cost reduction for a technology that was once far more expensive than atomic power, and could fuel calls for a rethink over the UK\u2019s future energy mix. Industry watchers said successful offshore windfarm developers may secure guaranteed payments for power as low as \u00a370-80 per megawatt hour in the government\u2019s auction, known as the second Contracts for Difference Allocation Round. In comparison, France\u2019s EDF has been promised \u00a392.50 per MW hour for power from the two reactors it is building in Somerset, around twice the wholesale price. The subsidies are paid by consumers via levies on energy bills. \u201cI think [windfarm developers] will bid very aggressively and below the headline strike price of Hinkley Point,\u201d said Richard Howard, head of research at the energy analysts Aurora Research, adding that the anticipated lower price was a result of dramatic cost reductions by the industry, brought about by the technology maturing. For example, developers are using much bigger turbines than half a decade ago, and less steel in the foundations that attach them to the seabed. The sector is also now perceived to be a much lower risk, bringing down the cost of capital. If the guaranteed price of power is as low as \u00a370 per MW hour \u2013 a level at the extreme end of what industry figures think is credible \u2013 that would mark a 42% reduction on the \u00a3119.89 price awarded for offshore windfarms in the last auction, held two years ago. Contracts awarded in 2014 were \u00a3155. Emma Pinchbeck, executive director at the industry group RenewableUK, said: \u201cI think it\u2019s a watershed moment for renewables. If the price comes in as low as people are suggesting, it means large-scale renewable generation will be cheaper than incumbent technologies. The idea that renewables are expensive is going to be undermined.\u201d Howard said one reason developers might bid very low was because there was uncertainty over when or whether future auctions would be held for offshore windfarms in the UK. Pinchbeck urged ministers to commit to a timetable for further auctions. \u201cThe idea that there will be more auctions, that\u2019s really important, for developing and keeping a supply chain in the UK,\u201d she said. The government has allocated another \u00a3440m a year for further auctions held before 2020, but since the general election it has not made clear whether they will still go ahead. The developers expected to share in this week\u2019s \u00a3290m pot are Germany\u2019s Innogy, Spain\u2019s EDP and Denmark\u2019s Dong Energy. The lower the companies bid in the competition, the more generating capacity will be built. Together, the successful windfarms are expected to supply around 2.5-3.5% of the UK\u2019s electricity demand when operational in the early 2020s. The results of Monday\u2019s auction could ignite a debate over UK energy policy, and whether the Conservatives should rethink their long-standing plan for a new fleet of nuclear power stations to replace ageing reactors and coal plants, which are being phased out. Greenpeace said the low prices would mark \u201ca huge moment for the UK energy sector\u201d. Keith Anderson, chief corporate officer at one of the UK\u2019s biggest energy companies, ScottishPower, said: \u201cMy challenge to the nuclear sector would be: look, here\u2019s the cost reduction offshore wind has demonstrated. \u201cThe challenge to nuclear industry is if you don\u2019t want people to criticise the \u00a392.50 per MW hour [subsidy that nuclear is receiving], show us how you are bringing the cost down. That is a colossal challenge.\u201d He said that with the UK committed to a low carbon economy regardless of Brexit, and with gas replacing coal on the power system, now would be a good time to ask where the country would go next on energy. The nuclear industry argues that no single low carbon source could meet the UK\u2019s power needs alone. \u201cWith two-thirds of the UK\u2019s currently dispatchable generation capacity due to retire by 2030, including all but one of the current nuclear fleet, the UK will need the full range of low carbon technologies to provide the reliable, secure and readily available power for homes, businesses and public services,\u201d said Tom Greatrex, chief executive of the Nuclear Industry Association. EDF said future new nuclear projects such as Sizewell C in Suffolk would be at a lower cost than Hinkley. The auction results, due at 7am on Monday, are also likely to inform a major government review of the costs of energy set to be published in October.",

That is a colossal challenge.\u201d</p> <p>He said that with the UK committed to a low carbon economy regardless of Brexit, and with gas replacing coal on the power system, now would be a good time to ask where the country would go next on energy. </p> <p>The nuclear industry argues that no single low carbon source could meet the UK\u2019s power needs alone.</p> <p>\u201cWith two-thirds of the UK\u2019s currently dispatchable generation capacity due to retire by 2030, including all but one of the current nuclear fleet, the UK will need the full range of low carbon technologies to provide the reliable, secure and readily available power for homes, businesses and public services,\u201d said Tom Greatrex, chief executive of the Nuclear Industry Association.</p> <p>EDF said future new nuclear projects such as Sizewell C in Suffolk would be at a lower cost than Hinkley.</p> <p>The auction results, due at 7am on Monday, are also likely to inform <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/jul/12/renewable-power-energy-costs-review-dieter-helm\">a major government review of the costs of energy set to be published in October.</a></p>",

      "bodyText": "\u2018Sometimes you get the impression that the British are talking to themselves,\u201d said the outgoing French ambassador, Sylvie Bermann, on the Today programme last week. There have been suggestions that the French are rubbing their hands and doing their best to lure as much business as they can from the City of London to Paris. My own impression, however, is that the French, and most other of our fellow Europeans, are saddened and not a little mystified by the sight of a nation whose leaders give every impression of rushing headlong to the cliff edge. Of course they want to take advantage of this weird situation. But it is a natural consequence of self-harming decisions made in this country, not in continental Europe. There was a similar air of puzzlement at the annual meeting of the Ambrosetti Forum which I attended last weekend in the beautiful surroundings of the Villa d\u2019Este on Lake Como. The Ambrosetti Forum has been described as the Italian version of the World Economic Forum in Davos, but it is a more civilised and less pretentious event. Nor was it just about Brexit \u2013 although it was a distorted version of what the EU\u2019s chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, said at the forum that captured the headlines in the Britain that talks to itself. I can tell you, I was there when Michel Barnier was speaking. He did not, as widely reported, say in belligerent tones that the British needed to be taught a lesson. His general tone was one of regret, but not hostility. The future of the EU itself was far more important than Brexit, but Brexit had \u201cextremely serious and important consequences, which should not be underestimated\u201d. Not unreasonably, he said that \u201cthese have not been explained properly to the British people\u201d. As for the endless \u201cdebate\u201d about the exit bill, he pointed out that there wasn\u2019t one. The UK had undertaken in 2014 to pay its 14% share of \u201call our [EU] expenses\u201d for the next seven years. As the Financial Times pointed out last Tuesday: \u201cThe EU commission \u2026 is clearly right that the UK should pay its share of budget commitments that have already been signed off, and agree in principle to cover pension liabilities.\u201d Barnier emphasised: there was no exit bill, no punishment. It wasn\u2019t blackmail. It\u2019s fact. A few days later, in response to some distorted reporting on the BBC, Barnier tweeted that Brexit was an \u201coccasion to explain single market benefits to all countries including my own\u201d. That was earlier in the week. Some of my anti-Brexit friends are worried that, while definitely winning in exchanges with our benighted government, Barnier must not make the mistake of overplaying his hand. The fear is that there could be a reaction in this country. While on Lake Como I met a Dutch couple who told me that when, the day after the referendum, they went to a Coldplay concert in Amsterdam, proceedings began with lead singer Chris Martin apologising to the audience for the referendum result! The result was bad enough, but the way our so-called leaders accepted \u201cthe will of the people\u201d amazes me. Yet, on returning to London last week I wondered whether there were not just a glimmer of hope, amid the outcry caused by the leak of the government\u2019s immigration proposals, and the chaos around the so-called repeal bill, that more of our parliamentarians are waking up to the damaging absurdity of Brexit. They made a mockery of their own sovereignty when, ignoring the wisdom of Edmund Burke, they acted as delegates after the referendum vote, not representatives with their own minds and judgment, and voted to trigger article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty, thereby setting out on the road to ruin. As the French president, Emmanuel Macron, stated in June, in spite of everything, the door to continued EU membership remains open. The ridiculous thing is that there are enough problems in the British economy and British society without the added self-inflicted damage from Brexit \u2013 a first taste, of course, being the collapse of the pound, which has hit British holidaymakers forcibly this summer. On the economy in general, the archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, in a report coordinated by the Institute for Public Policy Research thinktank, is surely right to claim that Britain\u2019s economic model is \u201cbroken\u201d and requires \u201cfundamental reform\u201d. But he and his colleagues also go on to say that reform is required on the scale of the 1940s and 1980s. I concur about the 1940s but I should like to remind the archbishop that much of the economic injustice that he so rightly laments dates from the more rampant elements of Thatcherism in the 1980s. Finally, all praise to John Le Carr\u00e9 for reminding us that his famous fictional character George Smiley dreamed of a united Europe, and not the Brexit that le Carr\u00e9 and so many of us detest.",
