Sports Direct is buying HoF\u2019s stores, its brand and its stock without the \u00a3400m of debt. The banks and bondholders are taking a bath. The \u00a390m purchase price suggest they\u2019ll get about 22p in the pound from the administration, which at least better than 3p that trade creditors can expect.

Sports Direct has been a backseat passenger under Nanjing Cenbest\u2019s ownership, refusing to sell its 11% stake even as it has dwindled in value, just as it clings to its 30% stake in the troubled Debenhams.

    "webTitle": "Trump doubles Turkish tariffs as lira plunges to record lows - as it happened", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The Turkish lira was already under pressure this week on concerns about the country\u2019s economy, but Donald Trump\u2019s tweet threatening to double tariffs on steel and aluminium sent the currency tumbling to new lows. The fallout saw European markets fall sharply, with investors worried about contagion effects, particularly on banks exposed to the Turkish currency. The escalation of yet another trade dispute hit not only European and emerging markets but Wall Street as well. The final scores in Europe showed: The FTSE 100 fell 74.76 points or 0.97% to 7667.01 Germany\u2019s Dax dropped 1.99% to 12,424.35 France\u2019s Cac closed 1.59% lower at 5414.68 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB finished down 2.51% at 21,090.78 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended 1.56% lower at 9602.1 In Greece, the Athens market lost 1.45% to 743.73 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 191 points or 0.75%. On the currency markets the Turkish lira, down 20% at one point, is 15.6% lower. The pound is also under pressure, as continuing Brexit concerns outweighed improving growth figures (although manufacturing moved into recession). Against the dollar sterling is down 0.6% at $1.2742 but it improved 0.5% to \u20ac1.1183 against a euro which has been weakened by worries about European banks\u2019 exposure to Turkey. On that note it\u2019s time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back next week. Here\u2019s our story on Turkey\u2019s problems: Turkey\u2019s unfolding economic crisis has deepened further after Donald Trump announced he is doubling US import tariffs on Turkish steel and aluminium, stoking the country\u2019s currency freefall and rattling financial markets. The Turkish lira plunged by more than 20% against the dollar after the president announced the move, amid a widening dispute between Washington and Ankara over the imprisonment of the US pastor Andrew Brunson. Pressure has been applied on the country in recent days to stage an emergency interest rate rise to avert further economic damage. Revealing an increase in US taxes on Turkish steel imports to 50% and on aluminium to 20%, the president tweeted: \u201cOur relations with Turkey are not good at this time!\u201d The full report is here: The fallout from Turkey is unlikely to be felt too strongly elsewhere despite fears of contagion, says John Higgins at Capital Economics: Our view is that Turkey\u2019s problems will continue to mount in the face of excessively loose monetary and fiscal policy...Despite a vague acknowledgement by the country\u2019s finance minister of the need for somewhat tighter policy, Friday\u2019s plan was devoid of detail and followed an anti-market diatribe from President Erdogan. We don\u2019t think that Turkey\u2019s growing difficulties will cause a lot of trouble elsewhere, though. This includes in other emerging markets [EMs], which tend to have limited trade and financial ties with, as well as smaller current account deficits than, Turkey. Meanwhile, the fragilities in Turkey\u2019s banking sector that are now grabbing attention are more acute than in most other EMs. Having said all of this, Turkey\u2019s woes are another headwind facing EMs that has arisen in the past few months: China\u2019s economy is now slowing, EMs are now tightening monetary policy and the trade war is escalating. So the situation in Turkey could worsen sentiment towards EMs and also strengthens our view that EM growth will weaken. Of course, investors are also worried about the implications of Turkey\u2019s problems for the euro-zone\u2019s banking system and economy. But while these concerns add to the long list of recent headwinds for the euro, neither the overall exposure of banks in the euro-zone to Turkey nor the direct links between the region\u2019s economy and the country is large. This is also the case for the wider world. The exposure of US and UK banks to Turkey is negligible. And Turkey\u2019s economy accounts for just one percent of the global economy at market exchange rates. Heading into the market close in Europe, and investors have taken fright at the Turkish problems, with worries about contagion uppermost in their minds. David Madden, market analyst at CMC Markets UK, says: European stock markets have been rocked by the plunge in the Turkish lira. The European Central Bank (ECB) warned that a number of eurozone banks might be exposed to the sharp decline in the Turkish lira. A number of Spanish, French and Italian banks are connected to Turkey in the form of foreign denominated loans, and if the Turkish borrowers haven\u2019t hedged their exposure it might spark defaults. Should European banks incur write-downs on account of the Turkish currency crisis, investment sentiment is likely to be weak. Many financial institutions in Europe have their own non-performing loans to contend with, and they could be facing a similar situation in Turkey. Reuters\u2019 Jamie McGeever has put today\u2019s fall in the Turkish lira into context: Here\u2019s Bloomberg\u2019s energy editor on Turkish steel exports, which will now be hit by the new Trump tariffs: Erdogan is now repeating his previous pleas to buy lira: The situation for Turkey looks bleak and it is entirely of its own making, says Jan Dehn, head of research at investment manager Ashmore Group: The situation unfolding in Turkey is fluid, but essentially unsurprising. Any emerging market investor who has done even a modicum of due diligence will be aware of the monetary policy problems Turkey has been running for years. President Erdogan\u2019s consistent pressure on the central bank to keep interest rates low \u2013 a product of his erroneous belief that high interest rates lead to inflation \u2013 has brought Turkey\u2019s macroeconomic situation into serious imbalance, hence placing the country in a vulnerable position. The chickens have now come home to roost. US President Donald Trump has, in typical fashion, wasted no time in exploiting a minor diplomatic spat over an American pastor jailed in Turkey to add insult to Turkey\u2019s largely self-inflicted injuries by slapping tariffs on Turkey \u2013 which will further exacerbate today\u2019s slide. The outlook for Turkey from here remains bleak. Ten years of macroeconomic mismanagement will take a long time to fix even if Turkey begins to follow sensible economic policies from here on out. A recession, and possibly a banking crisis, now look extremely likely. Does Erdogan understand how serious the situation has become? Does he suffer from the \u2018dictator problem\u2019, in which his advisers are scared to give him bad news and prudent advice? One thing seems clear now: if Erdogan continues to blame \u2018the economic war\u2019 and the \u2018interest rate lobby\u2019 then the outlook is even more complicated and any macroeconomic improvement less plausible. We remain underweight Turkey as we have done for some time, but it\u2019s important to remember that this is almost entirely a self-inflicted Turkish issue. No other emerging market country has a president who believes higher rates cause inflation. Investor sentiment towards EM more widely can temporary weaken, which is normal in periods of risk aversion, but such price action is not justified. If asset prices decline in other EMs just because Turkey does not have its house in order this should be viewed as a buying opportunity and exploited ruthlessly. Earlier Turkey\u2019s finance minister - and Erdogan\u2019s son-in-law had also tried to ease fears about the country\u2019s economy, including concerns about the central bank\u2019s independence. Associated Press reports: In a bid to ease investor concerns about Turkey\u2019s economic policy, the country\u2019s finance minister says the government will safeguard the independence of the central bank. Treasury and Finance Minister Berat Albayrak on Friday also vowed sustainable and healthy economic growth as well as \u201cstrong struggle\u201d against inflation, which currently stands at close to 16 percent. Albayrak was speaking at a conference where he outlined his ministry\u2019s \u201cnew economic policy\u201d as the currency plunged, raising questions about the country\u2019s financial stability. He said: \u201cOne of our principles will be ensuring the full independence of monetary policy.\u201d Investors are worried about the president\u2019s unorthodox economic policies, pressure exerted on the central bank, and a dispute with the United States that has led to sanctions. Before his second speech and after Donald Trump\u2019s speech, Erdogan was reportedly in contact with Russia: Turkish president Erdogan is making a second speech at the moment. He is currently talking about infrastructure spending, including better roads and tunnels. He says forget the lira, forget currencies and talks about being in love with the Turkish people. Neil Wilson, chief market analyst at Markets.com, also sees echoes of the Greek troubles: If you\u2019re looking for a black swan event, this could be it, although we must stress that so the panic is very much confined to Turkey. Nevertheless, ghosts of Greece are still vivid in the memory for European investors and today is the first sign that the problem with Turkey\u2019s larger dollar debts is no longer confined to its borders. Three summers ago, Greece was forced to impose capital controls to prevent a run on its banks, as its future in the eurozone hung in the balance. Gavin Friend, senior market strategist at National Australia Bank, believes Turkey could soon be forced into similar measures: \u201cThough hiking rates would be the market\u2019s preferred option for Turkey to stem this crisis and help deal with inflation this seems unlikely given what we heard from President Erdogan today. If we assume IMF assistance is out of the question from both sides, that leaves capital controls. That is problematic given Turkey\u2019s need for foreign inflows - but of course they won\u2019t be coming for now and stemming the flow the other way is the issue. This won\u2019t help in building trust between Turkey and international investors. Paul McNamara, investment director at asset management firm GAM, has written a fine explanation of the causes of Turkey\u2019s economic woes: \u201cWe think that Turkey has a toxic combination of a weak external position (current account deficit), excessive private sector debt and a high level of foreign funding in the banking system. This is coming to a head as a much-needed demand slowdown is causing asset quality problems in the banks. The role of construction in the economy for example is comparable with that in Spain or Ireland ahead of the European bust. \u201cWe think the Turks have exhausted the possibilities of rate hikes, and are backed into a corner by their inadequate level of currency reserves (the IMF thinks that Turkey has the least adequate level of reserves of the major EM economies. The country\u2019s politics are also a problem with the President\u2019s son-in-law as Finance Minister and perception of political interference with the \u201cindependent\u201d Central Bank. \u201cToday\u2019s developments have been very negative: President Erdogan made a belligerent speech with no reference to the need of a change of course. Finance Minister Albayrak made a content-free speech full of consultant platitudes. Finally, US President Trump doubled tariffs on Turkish metal exports \u2013 this is likely symbolic, but symbolising a lack of US support for the Ankara regime. \u201cOur strongly-held negative view on Turkey remains intact and we have not covered any risk.\u201d Turkey\u2019s deepening currency crisis is sending fear sweeping through the financial markets. All the main European stock markets are in the red, led by financial shares. Italy\u2019s benchmark stock index has sunk by 3% today. Germany\u2019s DAX has shed 2%, while Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 is down 60 points, or 0.8%. Several European banks have significant operations in Turkey, such as Spain\u2019s BBVA, Italy\u2019s UniCredit and France\u2019s BNP Paribas. Unicredit\u2019s shares have fallen by 5.6%, closely followed by BBVA (-5.4%) Deutsche Bank (-5.3%), ING (-5%) and BNP Paribas (-4.2%) According to the Financial Times, the European Central Bank is worried that Turkish borrowers might not be hedged against the lira\u2019s weakness and begin to default on foreign currency loans. Those loans make up about 40% of the Turkish banking sector\u2019s assets, and are now a lot more expensive to repay following the lira\u2019s tumble. Turkey\u2019s currency crisis could force president Erdogan to impose capital controls, or seek help from the International Monetary Fund, says Brad Bechtel of investment bank Jefferies: Turkey has a handful of options including seeking an IMF program, capital controls, rate hikes, yield to American demands or do nothing and so far the only option he seems to be leaning towards is do nothing. His stubborn stance against the US and twisted view of the IMF combined with a fear of higher interest rates make the situation untenable. The complete loss of credibility in the central bank was the final shoe to drop and spark for the latest rout we\u2019ve seen in the currency. Until decisive action is taken, they will continue to spiral out of control. Turkey is now suffering one of the most painful and intense currency crises in many years: The Turkish lira is plunging to new record lows following Donald Trump\u2019s tweet. It\u2019s now down 18% (!!) today, at over 6.5 lira to the dollar, compared with 5.5 lira last night. That means the currency has lost nearly a third of its value this week. A truly shocking plunge, suggesting Turkey\u2019s economy is getting into serious trouble. NEWSFLASH: Donald Trump has announced he\u2019s doubling the tariffs on Turkish steel and aluminium imports, as the diplomatic row between Turkey and the US deepens. Trump announced the move in a tweet, claiming it was in response to the lira\u2019s recent slump. This further intensifies the battle between the two countries over US pastor Andrew Brunson, who is currently imprisoned over terrorism charges. The moves comes shortly after Turkey\u2019s president claimed there was a campaign to harm Turkey by weakening the lira. Trump\u2019s move has sent the lira sliding deeper into trouble. It\u2019s now down almost 14% today at 6.3 lira to the dollar (a month ago it traded at 4.8). Turkey\u2019s currency crisis has deepened today, as president Erdogan attempting to calm the situation with a defiant address to the nation. After watching the lira fall to record lows in recent days, Erdogan declared that Turkey is facing an \u201ceconomic war\u2019, which he vowed not to lose. Erdogan also urged Turkish citizens to help, by swapping any foreign currency for lira to help stem its losses. If there\u2019s anyone who has dollars, gold or euros under their pillow, I am asking them to take them to the bank and exchange them for Turkish lira. Turkish assets have been slumping in recent days, for several reasons 1) A standoff with the U.S. over a detained American pastor that Turkey, a NATO ally, has put on trial for espionage and terror-related charges linked to a failed coup attempt in the country two years ago. Washington has imposed financial sanctions on two Turkish ministers and warned of additional measures unless the pastor is released 2) Investors are worried about the Erdogan\u2019s economic policies since his election win in June. He has long pushed the Turkish central banks to cut interest rates, claiming this would lower inflation (most economists take the opposite view). The lira has slumped by around 10% today, extending yesterday\u2019s deep losses. Paul Greer, portfolio manager at Fidelity International, argues that Turkey actually needs a massive interest rate hike of perhaps 10 percentage points, to restore market confidence. However, such a move would also probably drag Turkey into recession. Greer says: \u201cTurkey\u2019s macro challenges are numerous and well known - an overheating economy, a sizable external financing requirement, an outsized structural current account deficit, persistent double digit inflation, low net FX reserves and a large private sector debt burden. As a result of this, investor confidence in President Erdogan\u2019s regime has been waning for much of the past year but key cabinet changes made after the June 24th elections have been particularly damaging for sentiment..... \u201cWhile Turkey\u2019s fundamental challenges are numerous, there are plenty of straightforward textbook solutions which, if implemented, can halt the downward spiral of investor confidence and asset prices. An aggressive interest rate hike from the Central Bank would be a good start, something of the order of +1,000bp that Argentina delivered back in May would be appropriate at this juncture. This would help slow the economy, probably into a recession, which would help crunch the relentless demand for imports and thereby alleviate some of the current account deficit problem. Here\u2019s our economics correspondent Richard Partington on today\u2019s GDP figures: Warmer weather helped the British economy grow at a faster pace in the three months to the end of June, despite official figures revealing the manufacturing sector slumped into recession for the first time since the Brexit vote. The Office for National Statistics said GDP increased by 0.4% in the second quarter from a rate of 0.2% in the previous three months, helped by stronger retail sales and good weather enabling the construction industry to make-up lost ground from the heavy snow earlier this year. The better news for the economy comes after the Bank of England lifted interest rates to 0.75% last week, their highest level since the financial crisis a decade ago. Philip Hammond, the chancellor, said: \u201cWe are working hard to build a stronger, fairer economy \u2013 dealing with the deficit, helping people into work, and cutting taxes for individuals and businesses.\u201d Service industries experienced robust growth of 0.5% in the second quarter, with the retail and wholesale sectors providing the strongest contribution, helped by the warm weather tempting shoppers back to the high street. However, the latest snapshot from the ONS painted an increasingly lopsided picture for economic growth, with Britain reliant on the services sector amid a downturn for factory output. There were also indications of slowing growth in June, with the ONS revealing May was the strongest month of the second quarter. More here: Philip Hammond also dropped a loud hint that the UK government could push for new taxes on online retailers: Asked about House of Fraser\u2019s lurch into administration today, and the wider problems in the high street, he told Sky News that: We want to ensure that the high street remains resilient, and that we also make sure that taxation is fair between businesses doing business the traditional way, and those doing business online. That requires us to renegotiate international tax treaties because many of the big online businesses are international companies. The EU has been talking about a tax on online platform businesses, based on the value generated. Chancellor of the exchequer, Philip Hammond, has blamed Britain\u2019s slow growth in recent quarters on Brexit uncertainty. Speaking in Coventry today, Hammond told reporters that: \u201cClearly that uncertainty is having a depressing effect on economic growth.\u201d Hammond has been pushing for a \u2018soft Brexit\u2019, under which Britain maintained close links with the European Union. Back in January, he called for \u201ccontinued cross-border flow of ideas, goods, services, people and capital\u201d, annoying cabinet colleagues who favour a hard break with the EU. The TUC make a very important point -- if you adjust for population increases, Britain\u2019s growth has been extremely poor since the financial crisis. TUC General Secretary Frances O\u2019Grady blames weak investment over the last decade, which has meant earnings growth has been poor too: \u201cThe latest figures cap a dismal decade for the economy. But we should not accept weak growth as the new normal \u2013 it\u2019s the result of bad management of the economy. There has been too little investment and a failure to focus on getting wages rising. \u201cIf we want a stronger decade ahead, the UK must catch up with the levels investment we see in other OECD nations. And the government must put action to get wages rising at the heart of its plans.\u201d However...Rebecca Long Bailey MP, Labour\u2019s Shadow Business Secretary, is concerned that Sports Direct now has control of House of Fraser. She argues that the UK must reform its business rates system, to help high street chains compete with online retailers. \u2018It is unforgivable that the Conservatives have stood by and done nothing while tens of thousands of jobs have been put at risk. Their inaction has prepared the ground for the likes of Mike Ashley, notorious for his company\u2019s poor treatment of workers, to hoover up businesses. Staff will undoubtedly be concerned about what the sale means for their wages and conditions. \u201cHow many more of our most recognisable high street brands have to go under before the Prime Minister steps up and addresses the broken business rates system which is turning our high streets into ghost towns? Financial experts are pleased that House of Fraser has been saved from the abyss by Sports Direct - even though we don\u2019t know Mike Ashley\u2019s long-term plans for the retailer. Simon Underwood, business recovery partner at accountancy firm, Menzies LLP, says it\u2019s a \u201cwelcome outcome\u201d: \u201cThis is possibly the best news from the High Street this year and a positive indicator for other ailing retailers. \u201cHouse of Fraser is a strong brand and this \u00a390m bid from Sports Direct owner Mike Ashley means many of its stores will be saved and its operations streamlined. The fate of the remaining stores is uncertain - some may be sold off separately and others will be closed. The new owners will bring a timely injection of cash, ensuring a future for the various concessions and providing a more stable platform for the business to restructure its operations. \u201cIn a very fast-moving set of circumstances, this is a welcome outcome for both House of Fraser and UK consumers. It shows that there is light at the end of the tunnel and at least for the moment, a mainstay of the British High Street has been saved from the brink.\u201d Michael Mulligan, insolvency specialist at Shakespeare Martineau, thinks it\u2019s good news for suppliers and staff: \u201cNow that Sports Direct has acquired the House of Fraser brand \u2013 including all of the stock in the business - it will allow continued operation with a likely focus on the flagship stores. \u201cThis will be welcome news not only for suppliers who rely on House of Fraser for their livelihoods, but also for all employees involved. \u201cThis is yet another significant High Street rescue mission and the crisis shows no sign of abating. With interest rates rising and less money in the pocket of the UK consumer, more household names may be at risk.\u201d Britain\u2019s economy is still \u201cstruggling to gain momentum\u201d despite growing faster in April-June, says Mike Jakeman, senior economist at PwC, \u201cThe improvement was partly driven by one-off events, such as higher consumer spending on food and drink around the World Cup, the heatwave and the Royal Wedding. However, there was also some evidence that hot weather and wall-to-wall football deterred shoppers from buying goods other than food or drink. The net effect was that household consumption grew at the same pace as in Q1. \u201cInstead, the acceleration was driven by investment, which rebounded after a very poor first quarter, but only to the level seen at the end of 2017. Brexit-related uncertainty is still deterring large, export-focused firms from committing to investment plans. Net trade also subtracted from growth for the first time since late 2016, as a result of weaker exports of cars and planes. Professor Costas Milas of the University of Liverpool says today\u2019s UK GDP report is rather mixed: Although the 0.4 quarter on quarter per cent growth for 2018Q2 is in line with expectations, the annual growth reading of 1.3 per cent is slightly lower than that the 1.41 per cent estimate (based on market interest rate expectations) by BoE policymakers and even lower than the 1.5 per cent \u2018trend growth\u00b4 considered by the Bank as our new economic \u2018norm\u2019. So does that mean that the Bank of England was wrong to raise interest rates to 0.75% last week? Not at all, he explains: What BoE policymakers have decided to do is store up interest rate \u2018ammunition\u2019 should Brexit-related developments over the next few months require deep interest rate cuts to revive the economy. It is vital that financial markets and traders see all this so that selling pressure on the sterling currency recedes. Sam Tombs of Pantheon Economics makes an important point -- the slump in sterling since the Brexit vote has not healed the UK\u2019s trade woes: Anthony Gillham, head of investment at City firm Quilter Investors, isn\u2019t very impressed with today\u2019s growth report. He warns that the UK is still \u2018playing catch-up\u2019 after slowing last winter. \u201cWhile growth has improved slightly, it does so from a low starting point. Over the medium term, UK growth has been thoroughly unspectacular, with the domestic economy expanding at a slower pace than most developed countries. So with the pound at a 13-month low this morning, Gillham warns that imports will become more expensive.... \u201cThere is a real risk of stagflation on the horizon, with the recent interest rate hike failing to address the fall in the pound, and the sentiment of Mark Carney and Liam Fox even talking the value of Sterling to its lowest point against the dollar in a year. The UK finds itself in a difficult situation where the Bank of England is hiking rates to try and keep a lid on import costs that drive up inflation, but it is doing so against the backdrop of weak economic growth. \u201cThe general climate of uncertainty that pervades is discouraging households form making big ticket purchases, while business investment is also stifled as a result of CEOs feeling cautious about starting big projects before they have more certainty about the UK\u2019s future relationship with European trading partners. Suren Thiru, head of economics at the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC), says Britain\u2019s growth rate remains lacklustre. He\u2019s particularly concerned by today\u2019s trade figures, saying: \u201cThe higher growth in the second quarter was largely due to stronger service sector output, which helped offset a contraction in industrial output and a widening trade deficit. While there was pick-up in construction output, the improvement was from a low base, and the sector continues to add little to overall UK growth. \u201cThe widening of the UK\u2019s trade deficit in the quarter is disappointing, and reflects both a decline in goods exports and a rise in imported goods. The deterioration in the UK\u2019s net trade position is further confirmation that we are still some way from achieving a rebalancing of our economy. These charts show how Britain\u2019s trade deficit widened last quarter, and how it became MORE reliant on trade with the EU over the last year: UK economic growth is still \u201cway below the gains we were used to before the financial crisis\u201d says Rob Hodgson, Head of Wealth Management at GWM Investment Management. Economics journalist Dharshini David agrees that 0.4% growth isn\u2019t something to shout about John McDonnell MP, Labour\u2019s Shadow Chancellor, says the economy is suffering from Brexit uncertainty, and years of government cutbacks: \u201cMore than eight years of unnecessary ideologically-driven austerity has created an economy unable to cope with the instability brought about by the Tories\u2019 mismanagement of the Brexit negotiations. The result is low growth and stagnant pay. \u201cGrow this anaemic, councils are going bankrupt and the NHS is now in permanent crisis while holidaymakers are being hit by the Tories\u2019 falling pound. Labour will bring stability to the economy and rising living standards with long term stable planning and investment and by securing a Brexit deal that puts jobs and the economy first.\u201d Chancellor Philip Hammond has tweeted: Back on GDP, and this chart shows how Britain\u2019s manufacturers had a tough few months: Newsflash: Sports Direct has bought House of Fraser for \u00a390m, just a couple of hours after it fell into administration. The retailer, run by Mike Ashley, is acquiring all of the group\u2019s 51 stores, and its stock. It\u2019s not clear what this means for the company\u2019s 17,000 staff, though. In a statement, it says: Sports Direct International plc (\u201cthe Company\u201d or \u201cthe Group\u201d) announces the acquisition of the business and assets of House of Fraser from the administrators of House of Fraser Limited, House of Fraser (Stores) Limited and James Beattie Limited, the House of Fraser group\u2019s main operating companies (the \u201cOperating Companies\u201d), for a cash consideration of \u00a390 million (the \u201cTransaction\u201d). Pursuant to the Transaction, the Group has acquired all of the UK stores of House of Fraser, the House of Fraser brand and all of the stock in the business. For the year ended 28 January 2017 (the last date to which statutory accounts are available for the parent company of the Operating Companies and prior to the appointment of the administrators), the House of Fraser group had gross assets of \u00a3946.3m and made \u00a314.7m net profit. Although Britain\u2019s growth rate picked up in the last quarter, it has been modest for the last 18 months: Here\u2019s the breakdown sector-by-sector, confirming that Britain relied on its service sector for growth in the last three months, with construction also making a positive contribution. Here\u2019s Rob-Kent Smith, head of national accounts at the ONS, on today\u2019s data: \u201cThe economy picked up a little in the second quarter with both retail sales and construction helped by the good weather and rebounding from the effects of the snow earlier in the year. However, manufacturing continued to fall back from its high point at the end of last year and underlying growth remained modest by historical standards. \u201cThe UK\u2019s trade deficit noticeably worsened as exports of cars and planes declined sharply while imports rose.\u201d Britain\u2019s trade gap has worsened, as the country continues to import much more than it exports to the rest of the world. The total UK trade deficit widened by \u00a34.7bn to \u00a38.6bn in the three months to June 2018, due mainly to falling goods exports and rising goods imports. Britain\u2019s service sector drove growth in the last quarter, growing by 0.5%. The construction sector also had a good quarter, expanding by 0.9%. But the industrial sector shrank by 0.8% in April-June. That includes a 0.9% contraction across the UK manufacturing base. That means UK manufacturing is now in recession.... Breaking! The UK economy grew by 0.4% in the second quarter of 2018. That\u2019s up from 0.2% in the first three months of the year, as the economy got back up to speed after the bad wintery weather. More to follow! The pound has fallen to a fresh 13-month low against the US dollar this morning. Sterling shed three quarters of a cent in nervy trading to hit $1.2740, its lowest level since June 2017. This means that the pound has shed 10% of its value since April, as worries over a hard Brexit have intensified. But today\u2019s falls are also due to the US dollar\u2019s strength. Nervous traders are piling into the dollar, in the face of a mounting financial crisis in Turkey. The Turkish lira has gone through the floor this morning, tumbling a staggering 12%. Turkey\u2019s finance minister (who happens to be the president\u2019s son in law) is due to unveil \u201ca new economic model\u201d on Friday, which will include plans to cut the country\u2019s budget deficit. Investors, though, are losing faith - and increasingly alarmed about the central bank\u2019s independence. As Charlie Robertson of Renaissance Capital puts it: \u201cThe markets have lost confidence in the triumvirate of President Erdogan, his son-in-law as finance minister and the [central bank\u2019s] ability to act as it needs to.\u201d Overnight, we\u2019ve learned that Japan\u2019s economy expanded by 0.5%, thanks to a pick- up in consumer spending. Can the UK match it? Michael Hewson of CMC Markets predicts that the UK economy rebounded strongly in the last quarter: A decent recovery across construction, manufacturing and services is expected to show 0.4% growth, with the timing of Easter, a Royal Wedding and warm weather set to paint a decent picture of economic activity. In an hour we discover if he\u2019s right.... Retail expert Nick Bubb thinks some parts of House of Fraser can still be saved, saying: Hopes of a \u201cpre-pack\u201d deal to salvage parts of the business (with Sports Direct?) still seem high\u2026 The House of Fraser story is moving fast. Sky News are reporting that Mike Ashley, founder of Sports Direct, is close to agreeing a deal to take control of the company. It\u2019s not clear, though, how many of the company\u2019s stores he would take on. Frank Slevin, chairman of House of Fraser, says he\u2019s hopeful that the company\u2019s future will be sorted out soon. He told investors this morning: \u201cThis has been an extraordinarily challenging six months in which the business has delivered so many critical elements of the turnaround plan. Despite the very recent termination of the transaction between Cenbest and C.Banner, I am confident House of Fraser is close to securing its future.\u201d High street chain House of Fraser has confirmed it is appointing administrators after negotiations between investors and creditors failed to reach a \u201csolvent solution.\u201d The retail chain, which employs over 17,000 people, has been forced to turn to Ernst &amp; Young as administrators after days of negotiations with billionaire tycoons Mike Ashley and Philip Day, and the retail turnaround fund Alteri Investors. The company\u2019s 59 stores are all set to open as usual on Friday, while EY attempts to arrange a sale. Some 31 stores were previously earmarked for closure under an earlier restructuring plan, so HoF\u2019s staff now face fresh uncertainty. In a statement to investors, the company says: Court hearings are expected to take place at 7:30 am today, at which orders will be sought appointing individuals from Ernst &amp; Young LLP as administrators of each of the Operating Companies with immediate effect. Significant progress has been made towards completing a sale of the Group\u2019s business and assets. The proposed administrators are expected to continue to progress those discussions with a view to concluding a transaction shortly after their appointment. My colleague Sean Farrell explains how HoF could now be broken up: The group needs about \u00a350m after C.banner, the Hong Kong-listed owner of Hamleys, pulled out of plans to raise \u00a370m to invest in House of Fraser. Most industry experts expected any rescue to involve putting House of Fraser into administration to allow a new investor to buy its most attractive stores without taking on loss-making sites. Plum locations include shops in Glasgow as well as Bluewater in Kent, Manchester, Belfast and Meadowhall in Sheffield. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Today we discover how Britain\u2019s economy is faring, when growth figures for the second quarter of 2018 are released. Economists expect that GDP increased by 0.4% in April-June, as businesses got back up to speed after the Beast from the East hit growth. If they\u2019re right, this would mean the economy grew twice as fast as in the first quarter of the year. But it\u2019s still lacklustre growth in historic terms, extending the generally weak growth since the Brexit referendum in 2016 Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, says growth should have picked up in the last few months - even though consumer confidence is subdued. The second quarter was altogether brighter, with good weather, a Royal Wedding and the World Cup all driving consumer behaviour. The latest ONS retail sales data suggests that food and drink sales have been positively impacted by the sunshine and the football, while spending in pubs also increased by 9.5% year on year in June according to Barclaycard\u2019s consumer analysis. Not all parts of the UK economy have been making hay in the sunshine however, with big ticket items particularly under pressure. Household appliance sales fell 14.8% in the year to June according to Barclaycard, and the football combined with the warm weather led to a June drop in sales for non-food retailers according to the ONS. Also coming up today... Department chain House of Fraser is fighting for survival, after days of increasingly frantic rescue talks to secure new funding for the company. The company is going into administration, following all-night talks with potential bidders such as Mike Ashley, the owner of Sports Direct, Philip Day, the owner of Edinburgh Woollen Mill, and restructuring expert Alteri.

Meanwhile, the fragilities in Turkey\u2019s banking sector that are now grabbing attention are more acute than in most other EMs. </p> \n   <p>Having said all of this, Turkey\u2019s woes are another headwind facing EMs that has arisen in the past few months: China\u2019s economy is now slowing, EMs are now tightening monetary policy and the trade war is escalating. So the situation in Turkey could worsen sentiment towards EMs and also strengthens our view that EM growth will weaken.</p> \n   <p>Of course, investors are also worried about the implications of Turkey\u2019s problems for the euro-zone\u2019s banking system and economy. But while these concerns add to the long list of recent headwinds for the euro, neither the overall exposure of banks in the euro-zone to Turkey nor the direct links between the region\u2019s economy and the country is large.</p> \n   <p>This is also the case for the wider world. The exposure of US and UK banks to Turkey is negligible. And Turkey\u2019s economy accounts for just one percent of the global economy at market exchange rates. </p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5b6daeb1e4b048f8247cc449\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-08-10T15:28:34.389Z\">4.28pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Heading into the market close in Europe, and investors have taken fright at the Turkish problems, with worries about contagion uppermost in their minds. David Madden, market analyst at CMC Markets UK, says:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>European stock markets have been rocked by the plunge in the Turkish lira. The European Central Bank (ECB) warned that a number of eurozone banks might be exposed to the sharp decline in the Turkish lira.</p> \n   <p>A number of Spanish, French and Italian banks are connected to Turkey in the form of foreign denominated loans, and if the Turkish borrowers haven\u2019t hedged their exposure it might spark defaults. Should European banks incur write-downs on account of the Turkish currency crisis, investment sentiment is likely to be weak. Many financial institutions in Europe have their own non-performing loans to contend with, and they could be facing a similar situation in Turkey. </p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5b6da968e4b0bc551397db17\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-08-10T15:04:37.618Z\">4.04pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Reuters\u2019 Jamie McGeever has put today\u2019s fall in the Turkish lira into context:</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/ReutersJamie/status/1027933196384694272\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Turkish lira having one of the biggest one-day falls of any free-floating currency in over 20 years.

Any emerging market investor who has done even a modicum of due diligence will be aware of the monetary policy problems Turkey has been running for years. President Erdogan\u2019s consistent pressure on the central bank to keep interest rates low \u2013 a product of his erroneous belief that high interest rates lead to inflation \u2013 has brought Turkey\u2019s macroeconomic situation into serious imbalance, hence placing the country in a vulnerable position. The chickens have now come home to roost.</p> \n   <p>US President Donald Trump has, in typical fashion, wasted no time in exploiting a minor diplomatic spat over an American pastor jailed in Turkey to add insult to Turkey\u2019s largely self-inflicted injuries by slapping tariffs on Turkey \u2013 which will further exacerbate today\u2019s slide.</p> \n   <p>The outlook for Turkey from here remains bleak. Ten years of macroeconomic mismanagement will take a long time to fix even if Turkey begins to follow sensible economic policies from here on out. A recession, and possibly a banking crisis, now look extremely likely. Does Erdogan understand how serious the situation has become? Does he suffer from the \u2018dictator problem\u2019, in which his advisers are scared to give him bad news and prudent advice? One thing seems clear now: if Erdogan continues to blame \u2018the economic war\u2019 and the \u2018interest rate lobby\u2019 then the outlook is even more complicated and any macroeconomic improvement less plausible.</p> \n   <p>We remain underweight Turkey as we have done for some time, but it\u2019s important to remember that this is almost entirely a self-inflicted Turkish issue. No other emerging market country has a president who believes higher rates cause inflation. Investor sentiment towards EM more widely can temporary weaken, which is normal in periods of risk aversion, but such price action is not justified. If asset prices decline in other EMs just because Turkey does not have its house in order this should be viewed as a buying opportunity and exploited ruthlessly.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5b6da2e7e4b048f8247cc392\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-08-10T14:37:36.966Z\">3.37pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Earlier Turkey\u2019s finance minister - and Erdogan\u2019s son-in-law had also tried to ease fears about the country\u2019s economy, including concerns about the central bank\u2019s independence.

So what does the takeover mean for people waiting for deliveries, those holding gift cards and vouchers, or wanting to return goods? I\u2019ve got furniture on order. Will it be delivered?

Staff said they were told on Friday to tell customers that if they had placed an order it would still be delivered on the specified date. Don\u2019t panic, was the message. However, there is no specific guarantee from the new owner just yet. Neither the administrators, Ernst &amp; Young, nor the buyer, Sports Direct, the sportswear chain controlled by Mike Ashley, have officially said what will happen about fulfilling existing orders. Sports Direct has acquired the brand, the stores and all the stock under the deal, which secures 17,000 jobs for the time being. The stores remain open and after a brief closure on Friday, the website was open and taking orders. The Which? consumer rights expert Adam French said: \u201cThis sale should not have any negative impact on House of Fraser customers, so we want to see the company honouring its existing obligations to them. That means accepting gift vouchers, fulfilling online shopping orders and processing returns and refunds as if nothing has changed.\u201d I have a gift card. Will I still be able to use it? It\u2019s probably best to spend it soon. If a retailer folds, then customers who hold vouchers or gift cards are effectively creditors of the old business. They are entitled to their money back if there\u2019s enough cash to pay them when the business\u2019s assets are sold by the administrator. House of Fraser\u2019s swift sale to Sports Direct probably means that the vouchers are likely to be honoured. But note what happened when Comet went bust. Initially, it said gift cards and vouchers would not be accepted, then changed its mind. A few months later, the stores all shut, so the cards were useless again. So it\u2019s probably best to spend your House of Fraser vouchers soon. What if I want to return something I bought a while ago. How are my rights affected? The standard position under the 2015 Consumer Rights Act is that if you bought something in the store and it is faulty then you are entitled to a full refund within 30 days. After that, the retailer is supposed to offer a repair or replacement, or a partial refund. Again, House of Fraser\u2019s customer contact team have been telling people that their return rights remain the same. But it would be better to act now rather than later. Can I make a claim using the protections on my credit card? The Consumer Credit Act allows you to hold the credit card provider jointly liable with the retailer for anything you bought, provided the item cost between \u00a3100 and \u00a330,000. You should always use a credit card when buying items in this price range as it means you can make a claim if the retailer goes out of business or disappears. Again, there is no indication right now that House of Fraser\u2019s new owners will not honour past orders, but at least if you bought by credit card you have rights you can enforce.",

But it would be better to act now rather than later. </p> <h2><strong>Can I make a claim using the protections on my credit card?</strong></h2> <p>The Consumer Credit Act allows you to hold the credit card provider jointly liable with the retailer for anything you bought, provided the item cost between \u00a3100 and \u00a330,000. You should always use a credit card when buying items in this price range as it means you can make a claim if the retailer goes out of business or disappears. Again, there is no indication right now that House of Fraser\u2019s new owners will not honour past orders, but at least if you bought by credit card you have rights you can enforce. </p>",

      "bodyText": "Ryanair has cancelled nearly 400 flights as it battles unions in Germany, Sweden, Ireland, Belgium and the Netherlands. About 50,000 passengers have been directly affected, with others likely to be hit by delays. Ryanair says 85% of scheduled flights will operate as normal on Saturday, and that affected customers have mostly accepted places on alternative flights. But what if you are among those hit? What happens if my flight is cancelled? Ryanair says all customers have been contacted and offered a refund or alternative flight. Will I also be paid compensation under EU rules? This is a thorny one; under the EU261 compensation guidelines, airlines must pay \u20ac250 (\u00a3224) if journeys shorter than 1,500km (930 miles) are delayed by more than three hours. But they are only liable for compensation if the delay is caused by an extraordinary circumstance such as bad weather. If a flight is cancelled, then slightly different rules apply; if you were given more than 14 days\u2019 notice, you are only entitled to your money back or a new flight. If you had less notice than that, which will be the case with Friday\u2019s strikes, then you have a case for claiming compensation as well as the refund. Will Ryanair pay out? It is fighting hard against this. It argues that customers are not entitled to compensation for flights cancelled on 10 August because the strike amounts to \u201cextraordinary circumstances\u201d. It calls the strike action \u201cunjustified\u201d and says: \u201cUnder EU261 legislation, no compensation is payable when the union is acting unreasonably and totally beyond the airline\u2019s control.\u201d Aviation ADR, which handles airline disputes on behalf of passengers, refutes this claim and in previous disputes about cancellations owing to internal strikes has found in favour of consumers. A report published by Which? on Friday says: \u201cPassengers who have a flight cancelled with less than 15 days\u2019 notice as a result of flight or cabin crew industrial action should complain to the airline first. If they do not receive a satisfactory response, they have little choice but to use AviationADR. Unlike with the claims solicitors, the process is free and Ryanair is legally obliged to comply with its decisions.\u201d Doesn\u2019t Ryanair automatically reject compensation claims? They certainly take a robust approach. But passengers who take their complaint to Aviation ADR will face a long wait for results. The Which? research shows that only 14% of cancellation and delay claims handled by Aviation ADR against Ryanair led to a payout last year, and the figures for the first quarter of 2018 were worse. AviationADR received more than 3,600 EU261 complaints about the airline in 2017 but only 496 passengers were awarded compensation. According to the report, \u201cthe vast majority of complaints were still outstanding at the end of the year\u201d. What about any extra costs incurred because of the cancellation? The airline should provide reasonable accommodation and food while you wait for your alternative flight but it will not cover any \u201cconsequential losses\u201d such as for pre-paid accommodation or missed excursions in your destination. If the airline has rerouted you the insurance policy will not cover costs incurred while waiting for your alternative flight. What if I\u2019m delayed getting home? The airline is responsible for making sure you have suitable accommodation, transport to the accommodation, food, drink and access to email and a phone while you wait for an alternative flight. But it will not cover additional costs such as extended kennel fees for pets or extra car parking, and neither will your insurance policy, unless it has a section called \u2018if you are delayed returning to your home country\u2019. What if I cancel my trip altogether? The airline will refund your flight, but not the cost of your entire holiday. If you decide to cancel the trip your travel insurance will only cover you if your policy offers cancellation cover for \u201cany cause beyond your control.\u201d Most do not. \u201cIt\u2019s something to look out for the next time you are buying travel insurance,\u201d says Fiona Macrae of Travelinsuranceexplained.co.uk.",

    "webTitle": "Chancellor hints at tax measures to help high street after House of Fraser deal", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The government has hinted it could impose an \u201cAmazon tax\u201d on online sales as House of Fraser became the latest high street retailer to go into administration. The stricken department store chain, shorn of its debts and pension fund, was immediately snapped up by Sports Direct, the sportswear chain controlled by Mike Ashley, in a \u00a390m rescue deal. The deal will protect 16,000 jobs for the time being. Speaking on Friday, the chancellor, Philip Hammond, said: \u201cWe want to ensure that the high street remains resilient, and we also make sure that taxation is fair between business doing business the traditional way, and those doing business online. \u201cWe may have to look at temporary tax measures to rebalance the playing field until we can get international agreements sorted out.\u201d Traditional retailers face much higher tax charges than their online rivals. The business rates bill for House of Fraser\u2019s 59 outlets last year was just over \u00a330m, according to the property advisers Altus Group. House of Fraser had total sales of \u00a3787m. By comparison, Amazon had UK sales of nearly \u00a39bn, but paid only \u00a333m in business rates because it operates from low value warehouse property rather than prime high street locations. Last week it was revealed that Amazon UK\u2019s annual corporation tax bill \u2013 levied on profits from its warehouse business \u2013 was just \u00a34.6m. That was a reduction on the previous year, even though its profits were up from \u00a324m to \u00a372m. It was also able to defer a chunk of the total bill, so only paid \u00a31.7m. Its actual sales are recorded in Luxembourg. There have been a run of high street failures and closures this year, taking about 30,000 retail jobs with them. Toys R Us, Poundworld and Maplin have collapsed, while New Look, Mothercare, Marks &amp; Spencer and Carpetright have announced plans to close hundreds of stores as weak consumer confidence is compounded by the online shopping boom. On Friday, Sports Direct confirmed it had bought House of Fraser for \u00a390m in cash. Ashley, who also owns Newcastle United, promised to turn the struggling chain into \u201cthe Harrods of the high street\u201d, keeping as many stores open as possible. The chain was put into administration after talks with its creditors, which went on until 3am in the morning, failed to produce a better option. The loss-making retailer had \u00a3400m of debt. The deal will mean its secured lenders, who are at the front of queue to be paid in the event of administration, recoup abound 22p in the pound. The store chain\u2019s suppliers, who were due to be paid about \u00a360m next week, are expected to get only 3p in the \u00a31. House of Fraser\u2019s pension fund will now be assessed by the pension protection fund (PPF), the industry-backed lifeboat scheme. As the fund is in surplus by about \u00a320m as measured by the PPF, it is possible the scheme could be taken over by an insurance firm. However, any deal is still likely to fall short of previously promised benefits. All 59 House of Fraser stores will come under Sports Direct\u2019s control and all 16,000 staff are being transferred on the same employment terms and conditions. However, Ashley\u2019s plans for the business are unclear, and some stores may close in the future. House of Fraser\u2019s previous owner Nanjing Cenbest, part of China\u2019s Sanpower conglomerate, had planned to close 31 of the stores using a company voluntary arrangement (CVA), an insolvency procedure, but that deal lapsed when the 169-year-old department store chain went into administration. Ashley, whose business empire also includes a US sports business and a luxury London property development, has long wanted to take control of House of Fraser. He bought an 11% stake in 2014, when 89% of the business was sold to Sanpower in a deal worth \u00a3480m. He also has a 29.7% stake in House of Fraser\u2019s rival Debenhams. The addition of House of Fraser to the Sports Direct group will create a new force in high street retailing with annual sales of \u00a34.1bn \u2013 bigger than fashion and homewares chain Next. Sports Direct also owns the London sportswear store Lillywhites and the designer fashion chain Flannels. Scott Lennon, a regional officer at Unite, said the union was worried about how the Sports Direct takeover would affect working conditions at the House of Fraser: \u201cThe staff are entering a period of great uncertainty and worry.\u201d A Guardian investigation in 2015 found workers at Sports Direct\u2019s Shirebrook warehouse operation in the east Midlands effectively receiving hourly rates of pay below the minimum wage. \u201cSports Direct is a leopard that has not changed its spots and we hope that its poor record on pay and employment practices are not transferred to the House of Fraser,\u201d Lennon said. House of Fraser has been scrabbling to find a new buyer since the start of this month when C.banner, the Hong Kong-listed owner of Hamleys, pulled out of a commitment to invest \u00a370m in the business. The department store chain has been struggling as fewer shoppers visit the high street and last year\u2019s business rates increase makes running large high street stores even more expensive at a time when sales are moving online. Critics of the property tax argue that it gives online retailers such an Amazon an unfair advantage over traditional high street chains. Hammond told Sky News that any tax changes would require new international agreements: \u201cThat requires us to renegotiate international tax treaties because many of the big online businesses are international companies. We also agree with the French and the Germans that if we can\u2019t get international engagement to do this, we may have to look at temporary tax measures to rebalance the playing field until we can get international agreements sorted out.\u201d The EU has been talking about a tax on online platform businesses based on the value generated. Hammond said that was something he was \u201cprepared to consider\u201d. The speed of the House of Fraser-Sports Direct deal surprised other potential bidders including Philip Day, the owner of Edinburgh Woollen Mill. A source close to Day claimed the entrepreneur had put forward a proposal on Thursday and attempted to follow it up on Friday morning with a \u00a3100m offer. However, deal insiders countered: \u201cThere was only one bid on the table last night and there was no offer this morning.\u201d Alan Hudson, one of the joint administrators, described the attempt to find a new owner as a \u201crace against time\u201d. \u201cWe are pleased that we have been able to successfully conclude a sale of the business in short timescales which preserves as many of the jobs of House of Frasers employees as possible. We hope that this will give the business the stable financial platform that it requires to flourish in the current retail environment,\u201d he said. Richard Lim, the chief executive of Retail Economics, said: \u201cThis is a hugely ambitious move for Sports Direct. The combination of both businesses will yield some vital cost-savings while it\u2019s likely that some of the struggling House of Fraser sites will be rebranded to Sports Direct.\u201d He added: \u201cThis [department store] is a part of the industry that is under a huge amount of pressure. Turning around the business will not come easy.\u201d",

In 1953, still owned by the Fraser family, the group extended its geographic reach across Scotland and into north-east England and Carlisle with the purchase of the Binns chain, which had its origins in an early 19th century Sunderland drapery business.

Critics of the property tax argue that it gives online retailers such an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/amazon\">Amazon</a> an unfair advantage over traditional high street chains.</p> \n<p>Hammond told Sky News that any tax changes would require new international agreements: \u201cThat requires us to renegotiate international tax treaties because many of the big online businesses are international companies.

      "bodyText": "Warmer weather helped the British economy grow at a faster pace in the three months to the end of June, despite official figures showing the manufacturing sector slumped into recession for the first time since the Brexit vote. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said GDP increased by 0.4% in the second quarter from a rate of 0.2% in the previous three months, helped by stronger retail sales and good weather, which enabled the construction industry to make up lost ground from heavy snow earlier this year. The better news for the economy came after the Bank of England raised interest rates to 0.75% last week, their highest level since the financial crisis a decade ago. Threadneedle Street had forecast an average growth rate of about 0.4% in the second quarter. Philip Hammond, the chancellor, said Brexit uncertainty was depressing economic growth, as he used a trip to West Midlands on Friday to unveil \u00a3780m of new funding for high-tech industries. \u201cWe are working hard to build a stronger, fairer economy \u2013 dealing with the deficit, helping people into work, and cutting taxes for individuals and businesses,\u201d he said. John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, said austerity under the Conservatives had \u201ccreated an economy unable to cope with the instability brought about by the Tories\u2019 mismanagement of the Brexit negotiations\u201d. Service industries experienced robust growth of 0.5% in the second quarter, with the retail and wholesale sectors providing the strongest contribution, helped by the warm weather tempting shoppers back to the high street. However, the latest snapshot from the ONS painted a lopsided picture for economic growth, with Britain increasingly reliant on the services sector amid a downturn for factory output. There were also indications of slowing growth in June, with the ONS figures showing May was the strongest month of the second quarter. The manufacturing industry recorded its second consecutive quarter of negative growth since the first quarter of 2016 \u2013 meeting the official conditions for an economic recession \u2013 amid weaker international demand for British goods. While manufacturing output fell by 0.9%, the sector is smaller than the dominant services industry, meaning its drag on overall economic growth was only about 0.1%. The greatest falls in output were reserved for factories producing metal products and electrical equipment, where exports are important. Lee Hopley, the chief economist at the EEF manufacturers\u2019 organisation, said the industry could face tough conditions ahead. \u201cThe autumn Brexit negotiations and related focus on the risk of \u2018no deal\u2019 will increase uncertainty,\u201d she said. Growth in the production industries \u2013 which include mining and energy alongside the manufacturing sector \u2013 fell by 0.8% as the warm weather reduced demand for heating. Maintenance work at the Sullom Voe oil terminal on Shetland in May also cut energy production. The figures showed trade acted as a drag on GDP growth in the second quarter, suggesting there was no longer a boost for manufacturers from the weak pound \u2013 making sales of UK-made goods since the EU referendum more competitive. Britain\u2019s trade deficit \u2013 the difference between imports and exports \u2013 widened by \u00a34.7bn to reach \u00a38.6bn in the three months to June, due mainly to falling exports of goods and higher levels of imports. The figures also showed the UK becoming more reliant on the EU for trade, despite the efforts of ministers to drum up interest elsewhere around the world. Over the past year, exports and imports of goods to and from the EU increased by more compared with non-EU countries. Suren Thiru, the head of economics at the British Chambers of Commerce said: \u201cDespite growth in the second quarter, there is little in the latest data to suggest a sustained upturn in the UK\u2019s economic growth prospects.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Adani and the Queensland government were aware that polluted water could be released from the company\u2019s Abbot Point coal terminal during cyclone Debbie in 2017, conservationists say. Adani was granted a temporary emissions licence on 27 March last year, before cyclone Debbie made landfall, to pollute the nearby Caley Valley wetlands in an area referred to as W1. After the cyclone hit, the government issued an amended licence that retrospectively allowed increased pollution from a second location, referred to as W2, towards the Great Barrier Reef world heritage area. Last year the Queensland government issued a penalty notice to Adani for breaching the amended licence by more than 800%. Documents obtained by the Mackay Conservation Group under Queensland\u2019s right to information laws, and reported by the ABC, show correspondence between Adani and the Queensland environment department in the hours leading up the cyclone. The group, which waited more than a year for the information after Adani fought its release, said the emails appear to show both the company and the government were aware the spills were likely to breach the licence. The emails show that after Adani received its temporary emissions licence on 27 March, the company sent a last minute email that said: \u201cSorry I just noticed W2 wasn\u2019t included in the TEL, is it possible to include this location?\u201d The following morning the department replied asking if the amended licence for W2 was still required. About 4.30pm on 28 March, hours after the cyclone made landfall, an Adani employee replied saying \u201cYes please\u201d and the department responded: \u201cJust give me a little detail and we can include and update TEL.\u201d Adani sent the information about 5pm, telling the department: \u201cReleases from this location are small in volume however the TSS [total suspended solids] is always greater than 30mg/L (approx between 500+ to 900 from memory!) as this location is actually a sump and prior to any treatment process (a historical legacy discharge location).\u201d The temporary licence granted to Adani allowed for the release of water with a concentration of suspended solids of up to 100mg per litre. Peter McCallum, coordinator of the Mackay Conservation Group, said the emails show the company knew the pollution could occur. \u201cThese documents that Adani didn\u2019t want released to the public show they were fully aware there was a high concentration of pollutants in the water that would be released,\u201d he said. \u201cTime is running out for the Queensland government to prosecute Adani for breaking the licence by 800%.\u201d Adani has been fighting the $12,190 fine that was issued for the breach. A spokeswoman for Adani said the company \u201ccategorically denies\u201d allegations that it attempted to hide information relating to the licences. \u201cThese reports are misleading and do not contain an accurate account of events,\u201d she said. \u201cAdani was simply concerned that certain content requested by the Mackay Conservation [Group] under right to information provisions would not be read in the full context of the situation, and may be selectively used to attempt to damage Adani.\u201d She said the initial application for the temporary emissions licence applied to both W1 and W2 and \u201ca clerical error by the regulator during the issue of the TEL meant W2 was initially omitted and was later added after the regulator was notified of the mistake\u201d. She said the company had complied with all the environmental requirements of the licence. \u201cWe have therefore elected to have the matter heard by a magistrate rather than pay a fine which should not have been issued. We look forward to a resolution of the matter,\u201d she said. The Queensland environment and science department said it would not comment because the matter was still under investigation. Christian Slattery, the Stop Adani campaigner for the Australian Conservation Foundation, said the government should hold the company accountable. \u201cOur elected representatives have consistently stated that Adani will be subject to strict environmental conditions,\u201d he said. \u201cBut unless these laws are enforced, they aren\u2019t worth the paper they\u2019re written on.\u201d",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Ryanair is facing legal claims from unions for allegedly violating labour laws during a row with striking workers, as the airline faces a new round of industrial action that could affect its low-cost business model. Ryanair pilots in Belgium, Germany, Ireland, the Netherlands and Sweden are due to hold 24-hour strikes on Friday over terms and conditions. The airline is understood to have cancelled hundreds of flights as a result. Ryanair faces renewed pressure from unhappy workers after it agreed to recognise trade unions for pilots and cabin crew in December \u2013 something the chief executive, Michael O\u2019Leary, had previously said he would rather cut off his hands than agree to. Strikes were partly to blame for profits falling in the first quarter of its financial year. But after making deals with unions in countries including the UK and Italy, the airline has failed to engage with workers, unions claim. Pilots and cabin crew have responded with a string of strikes seeking better terms and conditions. Cabin staff in Belgium, Italy, Portugal and Spain walked out for 48 hours last month. Ryanair responded to strikes in Ireland by issuing redundancy notices to 300 staff in Dublin last month and shifting some planes from Ireland to Poland. Soon afterwards, O\u2019Leary said: \u201cIf we have people who just want to have strikes for the sake of having strikes then they can have strikes and they\u2019ll find themselves [with] jobs getting moved and aircraft getting moved.\u201d Unions have alleged Ryanair is using other tactics to deter workers from striking. While most EU countries allow companies to dock pay from striking staff, union sources said Ryanair threatened to strip crew of productivity bonuses and warned that their promotion chances would be affected, which would be in breach of labour laws. In a letter from Ryanair\u2019s chief people officer, Eddie Wilson, to Spanish crew, the airline promised that \u201cno one can be punished or victimised\u201d if they chose to strike. But one cabin crew member showed the Guardian a subsequent letter that said they would lose their monthly productivity bonus. The letter continued: \u201cAll no-shows are recorded in your absence record and are taken into consideration along with all relevant factors of performance when assessing promotion and transfer opportunities.\u201d The Independent Transport Workers Federation (ITF), an umbrella body for trade unions, said Ryanair could be hit with lawsuits for allegedly breaching labour laws in several countries. \u201cUnions in countries directly affected by all the latest actions against Ryanair workers are pursuing a mixture of legal claims and investigations with the appropriate government agencies,\u201d said ITF\u2019s general secretary, Stephen Cotton. \u201cThey are having to claim once again that Ryanair are infringing their members\u2019 fundamental rights in breach of labour laws in their country.\u201d A Ryanair spokesperson said: \u201cAs with any company dealing with industrial relations disputes and strike action, employee attendance is recorded so that pay can be adjusted accordingly. Participation in a strike does not affect promotion or transfer decisions and this was also confirmed to our crew.\u201d O\u2019Leary has said he is willing to deal with short-term disruption rather than give in to demands that undermine the low-fare, low-cost business model that has made Ryanair Europe\u2019s biggest airline. But investors are showing signs of doubt. Ryanair shares have lost a fifth of their value in the past year while its low-cost rival easyJet, which has long-standing union agreements, saw its share price rise by a fifth. Most equity analysts argue Ryanair will be able to get through the turmoil. Gerald Khoo at broker Liberum said: \u201cThere is space for Ryanair management to reach sensible agreements so that Ryanair will have the same profitability in the long term.\u201d HSBC aviation analyst Andrew Lobbenderg argues that Ryanair\u2019s industrial relations problems call into question its low-cost model and its governance. Its troubles may lie partly in the lack of challenge by board members to their \u201chigh-profile, charismatic CEO\u201d, Lobbenberg said. \u201cWe foresee higher wages, social costs, reduced productivity, flexibility and higher overhead costs,\u201d Lobbenberg wrote in a note to investors. \u201cThe evolution towards employment practices more in line with industry norms will structurally weaken profitability and thus poses deeper questions to management and the board.\u201d Until recently, Ryanair was able to divide its workforce by striking different deals across the countries it flies between. Containing the strikes may be difficult for a company whose historic failure to recognise unions leaves it with little experience to draw on for a major dispute. Tony Dundon, professor of human resource management and labour relations at Manchester University, said: \u201cThe idea of riding it out is typical of a small entrepreneurial mindset rather than a more sophisticated management process. The key problem is the potential for escalation.\u201d",
