      "bodyText": "The boss of America's biggest bank, JP Morgan, was on Thursdaypersonally negotiating a new financial settlement with US regulators over allegations stemming from the way the bank sold sub-prime mortgage bonds before the banking crisis. The settlement could reach a record $11bn (\u00a37bn) Jamie Dimon, one of the few bankers still at the helm of a big bank following the 2008 financial meltdown, turned up for face-to-face talks with the US attorney general, Eric Holder, at the department of justice in Washington. The negotiations prompted fresh speculation that Dimon will be forced to agree to a payout bigger than the $4.5bn paid by BP over the Gulf of Mexico oil spill. There are suggestions JP Morgan could be forced to make $4bn of payments to consumers and $7bn of penalties to cover losses incurred from the way mortgages were packaged by JP Morgan as the financial crisis took hold. The new payout negotiations come only a week after JP Morgan was fined $920m by regulators in the US and the Financial Conduct Authority in Britain over the $6.2bn trading losses that became known as the \"London Whale\" incident a year earlier. In an unusual move, JP Morgan admitted wrongdoing and was accused of \"unsafe and unsound practices\" in derivatives trading taking place in the so-called chief investment office.

      "bodyText": "And that's a good moment to stop for the day. We'll be back tomorrow.. Cheers, and goodnight! GW And here's the full details of Enrico Letta's latest comments on the political crisis in Italy tonight -- via Reuters' New York office (where he's been speaking at the Columbia University's World Leaders Forum) Italian Prime Minister Enrico Letta said he would meet President Giorgio Napolitano on Friday to discuss the tense political situation following threats by the centre-right party of Silvio Berlusconi to pull out of his coalition government. \"I asked to be received by the head of state,\" Letta told reporters on Thursday during a visit to New York. \"I will ask both the government and parliament what road we want to take because it is absolutely essential to achieve clarity and stability,\" he said. Letta said he had \"comprehension\" for the difficulties of Berlusconi and his lawmakers following Berlusconi's conviction last month for tax fraud, but it was vital that these should be \"clearly separated\" from the fate of his government. It's been a busy day for Letta - he also ran the opening bell on Wall Street. 26-Sep-2013 18:44 - ITALY PM LETTA SAYS ITALY NEEDS TO ATTRACT FOREIGN CAPITAL, WHILE MAINTAINING STRATEGIC INTERESTS Newsflashes from Italy's prime minister tonight: 26-Sep-2013 18:30 - ITALY PM LETTA SAYS WILL MEET PRESIDENT NAPOLITANO ON FRIDAY TO DISCUSS POLITICAL SITUATION 26-Sep-2013 18:31 - ITALY PM LETTA SAYS WILL GO BEFORE ITALIAN PEOPLE TO REQUEST CLARIFICATION OF SITUATION 26-Sep-2013 18:32 - ITALY PM LETTA SAYS AIMS TO CONVINCE ITALIAN PEOPLE PARLIAMENT OF NEED TO GUARANTEE STABILITY City investors are braced for the Italian political turmoil to continue for a while, according to this round-up from Reuters tonight: Threadneedle Investments' global equities head William Davies said his firm was avoiding the \"periphery\" of southern European such as Italy and Spain, which have been hardest hit by the euro zone sovereign debt crisis. Yet Davies was nevertheless selectively adding to European equities, such as Swiss bank UBS and autoparts supplier Continental, arguing the broader European economy would continue its gradual recovery from the worst hits of the region's debt crisis in 2011. \" We continue to avoid stocks in the periphery. However, we believe the worst is now over,\" he said. Andrew Arbuthnott, head of European large-cap equities at Pioneer Investments, also felt the broader European equity rally would be able to withstand any wobble in the Italian stock market as did Andreas Clenow, hedge fund trader and principal of Zurich-based ACIES Asset Management. \"There will be another round of sell-offs related to Italy, and we have had a little pullback in recent sessions but it's nothing much. We are still in a bull market.\" And over on Wall Street, shares are rallying sightly -- with the Dow Jones index up 58 points at 15332, +0.4%. As Kizbot flagged up in the reader comments this morning, a curious story broke in Greece overnight -- a group of army reservists are calling for the government to step down. This prompted heated talk of a possible coup brewing -- although the organisation, called the Hellenic Special Forces Reserve Union (KEED) denied this in a statement earlier today. KEED are planning a rally in Syntagma Square on Saturday, where they will apparently urge Antonis Samara to resign (although the PM is heading to the US that day. so the reservists might miss him). Greek-based journalist Damian Mac Con Uladh has written up KEED's plans: A group calling itself the Special Forces Reserve Union (KEED) wants the government to resign, the suspension of all laws relating to the troika memorandum and the expulsion of 'illegal immigrants'. A prosecutor in Athens has ordered an investigation into a blog post that appeared on a special forces reservists' website demanding the government and president resign and an interim government be appointed under the \"guarantee\" of the armed forces. In a statement posted on its website on September 23, the Hellenic Special Forces Reserve Union (KEED) says it will assemble at 4pm at Syntagma Square in order to demand \u201cthe immediate resignation of the government\u201d because it has failed in its duty to provide \u201chealth, education, justice and security\u201d that it says it is obliged to do under article 22 of the constitution. More from Damian here: Special forces reservists call for resignation of government Kathimerini is also reporting that the government has launch an investigation. Speaking to people in Greece today, few of them are taking KEED particularly seriously. After all, if you were actually planning a Coup d'\u00c9tat you'd hardly announce it on the internet. Three days in advance. Still, the group certainly exists. Although some of the photos on their webpage suggest the group are physically more suited to, well, live-blogging rather than military combat. They do have form, though -- they held a protest march when Angela Merkel visited Greece last year. Here's a video clip to prove it: More details on that Bank of England IT glitch: Over in Greece our correspondent Helena Smith says the government appears to be heading for a major bust-up with the troika over demands that it close loss-making defense industry and mining company. Helena writes: With protestors chanting outside, the Greek finance minister Yannis Stournaras launched into the potentially explosive world of trying to keep Greece\u2019s ailing defence industry alive this afternoon. Negotiations with mission heads representing the country\u2019s troika of creditors will not be easy with one finance ministry official admitting \u201cwith protestors outside they\u2019ve been given extra protection.\" Troika demands that the government close the industries have been rejected outright not least by prime minister Antonis Samaras who is acutely aware of the companies\u2019 symbolic importance and fears the effect closures would have not only on morale but joblessness given Greece\u2019s historic levels of unemployment. Earlier this month the finance ministry proffered an alternative plan outlining a root-and-branch overhaul of the enterprises. It was rejected outright by the troika with Matthias Mors, the European Commission's representative in the troika, feeling fit to describe the restructuring plans as \u201cnot viable or realistic\u201d. [They] do not guarantee a sustainable solution from the economic efficiency, budgetary and state aid points of view. In our view, the option of closure/liquidation must be considered for all three companies,\u201d he wrote in an email leaked to the media. But Samaras\u2019 fragile coalition is digging in its heels. \u201cYes, they rejected it but the plan is still on the table and is among the many issues that will be discussed today. We are sticking by it. It all part of the negotiations and is as simple as that,\u201d one aide confided. The spat now casts a shadow over the debt-choked country's next aid installment - at \u20ac1bn, vital to paying state pension and paychecks. It's due on October. Watch this space! Back to Italy, and the political crisis that flared up today as deputies of Silvio Berlusconi's centre-right party threatened to resign from the government has driven down shares, and pushed up bond yields. The FTSE MIB closed down 216 points at 17872, a drop of 1.2%. Other markets were mixed -- the FTSE 100 closed up 14 points, or 0.2%, at 6565. The German DAX closed flat, the French CAC shed 0.2%, and the Spanish IBEX climbed 0.3%. Italy's 10-year bonds were changing hands at a yield of 4.34%, up from 4.23% last night. President Giorgio Napolitano's strongly worded statement, criticising MPs who were considering quitting the government in protest at Berlusconi's treatment, seems to have calmed the situation. It could be on hold until prime minister Enrico Letta returns from America to hold talks with his party. Meanwhile, Gianluca Susta, who heads the Civic Choice party of ex-Premier Mario Monti in the Senate, has also criticised the centre-right. He said that if Berlusconi's allies resigned, they would look like the \"court of an absolute monarchy\" rather than elected representatives in a functioning democracy. It's official: JP Morgan is taking the BBC's Stephanie Flanders off the air: She'll be missed. The news comes as JP Morgan's CEO, Jamie Dimon, met with the US Attorney General Eric Holder to discuss a possible settlement to various claims related to the sale of mortgage-backed securities. There's talk that the settlement could reach $11bn. More details on fastFT Something's gone wrong with the Bank of England's computers this afternoon, but they insist they've not been hit by hackers. The Bank has released a short statement, explaining: The Bank has been experiencing some technical IT problems today. There is no impact on critical payment and settlement services. Alternative procedures are in place where necessary. The Bank is acting to resolve these problems as soon as possible. So what's gone wrong? The press office tell me that \"there has been a failure of a component\" in a piece of hardware. Is it a cyber attack, I ask? Certainly not, a spokesman insisted. It's not clear, though, which bit of the Bank's doubtless-gleaming IT systems has fizzled out. A few people in the City might notice that something's wrong -- thus the statement. Might have more details later.... Speaking of the Federal Reserve.... one of its board governors has admitted that the US central bank made a bit of a hash of communicating its monetary stimulus strategy. Eight days after the Fed surprised the markets by not slowing the pace of its bond buying programme, Jeremy Stein told an event in Frankfurt that the Fed needed to improve its communications. Interestingly, he also suggested that some automatic triggers might be the way forward, under which the Fed's QE programme would be cut, or tapered, in line with economic data. Stein suggested a fixed cut in QE spending for every 0.1% change in the jobless rate -- which is already been dubbed the Stein Rule on Twitter: Stein also suggested that the Fed will only make 'modest' cuts to its overall bond-buying programme, which is currently mopping up $85bn of government bonds and mortgage-backed securities each month. He explained: Whether we start in September or a bit later is not in itself the key issue - the difference in the overall amount of securities we buy will be modest. What is much more important is doing everything we can to ensure that this difficult transition is implemented in as transparent and predictable a manner as possible. On this front, I think it is safe to say that there may be room for improvement. The US housing market, though, looks less impressive. The total of pending home sales (ie, where an offer has been accepted but not completed) dropped by 1.6% in August. A bigger fall than expected. Economists reckon that a recent rise in mortgage rates (driven by the expectation that the Federal Reserve would slow its stimulus bond-buying scheme) deterred some potential buyers. A shortage of houses on the markets is also being blamed. Turns out the US employment market might have been stronger than we thought last year. The Bureau of Labor Statistics has conducted his annual review of its monthly jobs data, and concluded that an extra 345,000 jobs were created in the year to March. That puts another 0.3% onto the US employment rate. Here's AP's take on the situation: Italy president outraged by Berlusconi lawmakers Italy's president has issued a scathing rebuke to lawmakers of Silvio Berlusconi's party for purportedly threatening to resign en masse if the former premier is ousted from Parliament. The Senate is due to vote next week on whether to strip Berlusconi of his seat following his conviction for tax fraud and four-year prison sentence. A 2012 law bans anyone sentenced to more than two years in prison from holding or running for public office for six years. President Giorgio Napolitano on Thursday accused members Berlusconi's People of Freedom party of undermining Italy's parliamentary system and putting undue pressure on him to dissolve parliament and call new elections. He said it was \"absurd\" of them to claim that Berlusconi was being overthrown by magistrates. He said court rulings must be respected. Italian prime minister Enrico Letta will hold talks with the parties supporting his coalition government when he returns to Rome from New York, the ANSA newswire reports. That means Berlusconi's side, and his own centre-left PD group. ANSA adds: Forza Italia* members of the Lower House and Senate started signing their resignations and giving them to their respective whips on Thursday after agreeing Wednesday to quit if a Senate panel next week votes to strip Berlusconi of his parliamentary seat after a tax-fraud conviction was upheld by the supreme court. \u2022 - The People of Freedom party is being relaunched at Forza Italia The Italian stock market remains sharply down, despite president Napolitano trying to head off a revolt from Silvio Bersluconi's MPs (who are coalition partners with the centre-left Democratic Party). The FTSE MIB is down 1.5%, with 35 of its 40 constituents falling. And government bonds are still suffering (the yield on Italy's 10-year bonds is still up at 4.32%). Timo del Carpio, European economist at RBC Capital Markets, said the latest political instability was alarming the markets: This is the latest in a series of politically noisy events that threatens not only the stability of the current government, but the longer-term reform process more generally. Listening to Berlusconi's allies, it's appears they are split over whether or not to pull out from the government. Maurizio Gasparri, the party's deputy floor leader, has claimed that party members decided to resign \"by acclamation\" last night. However, constitutional reform minister Gaetano Quagliariello painted a quite different picture, telling reporters in Rome that: We didn't vote for any resignation yesterday. If you're going to resign, you do it, you don't announce it. Italy appears to be wobbling on the edge of a serious political crisis, although president Napolitana's decision to rebuke Silvio Bersluconi's side (see 1.01pm) today may calm the situation. The FT's man in Rome, Guy Dinmore, reports that the latest upheaval was fanned by rumours over the prime minister, Enrico Letta. Dinmore also flags up that commentators in Italy aren't sure what to make of last night's threats from Berlusconi's supports to pull out of Letta's government. After all, Berlusconi would be barred from any snap elections as he'd be serving his house arrest sentence. Dinmore writes: The sense of confusion was compounded by reports that Mr Letta \u2013 who was in New York on Wednesday expressing confidence in Italy\u2019s stability while drumming up foreign investment \u2013 had also threatened to resign. Fabrizio Saccomanni, finance minister, last weekend said he was ready to resign over a separate dispute about a decision on whether to increase sales tax from October, while La Stampa reported on Thursday that Mr Napolitano was also considering his own resignation as president. Mr Napolitano is widely understood to be set against using his constitutional powers to dissolve parliament and call new elections, and could ask Mr Letta to try to form an alternative majority in parliament. The political crisis blew up with Letta out of the country -- as Berlusconi's party fulminated last night, Letta was addressing the United Nations. A change from the Disunited Nation back home I mentioned briefly this morning that Britain's current account deficit had widened last quarter to a worse-than=expected \u00a313bn. Here's a graph showing how the situation has steadily deteriorated since the financial crisis began. Economics editor Larry Elliott explains that this takes the gloss off the encouraging news that the economy is growing. He writes: Britain has been consistently in the red since it last ran a current account surplus in 1998, and the underlying trend has got worse in recent years. Across the first two quarters of 2013, the deficit averaged more than 4% of GDP. The current account has three main components \u2013 trade in goods and services, investment income, and transfers to international institutions such as the European Union and the United Nations. Investment income tends to be quite volatile, helping to explain the particularly big deficit of more than 5% of GDP racked up in the first quarter of 2013. But given the competitive boost provided by the 25% fall in the value of the pound between 2007 and 2009, there has been only a modest decline in the deficit on trade in goods and services. The hollowing out of Britain's manufacturing base in the past two decades can be illustrated by the fact that the devaluation that followed Black Wednesday in 1992 resulted in healthy trade surpluses for a number of years. Periods of economic growth in the UK are accompanied by bigger trade deficits; worryingly, this one begins with the deficit already averaging \u00a35-6bn a quarter in the first half of 2013. More here: A growing economy, but beware the red warning sign of trade deficits Encouraging signals from the US jobs market. The weekly unemployment data shows that 305,000 people signed on for unemployment benefit last week, a drop on the 310,000 who filed initial claims the previous week. There's a flood of US data on the wires. First, US GDP data has been released, confirming that America's economy grew by 2.5% in the second quarter of this year, on an annualised basis (so around 0.6% quarter-on-quarter). Economists had expected a small upward revision, to 2.6%. The repost also shows that inflation fell by 0.1% during the quarter -- which may indicate firms struggled to raise prices. Italian President Giorgio Napolitano has let rip at Silvio Berlusconi's centre-right allies in the statement issued a few minutes ago. The 88-year-old head of state has not minced his words as he responded to the threat from the PDL members to resign. Such a move, he declared would be a blow to the roots of parliament's ability to function. Napolitano was dismissive of the idea that People of Freedom (PDL) MPs should show their loyalty to Berlusconi with a walkout that would seriously undermine prime minister Enrico Letta. He said: There is still time, which I hope is used well, to find a way to express - if this is what the PDL parliamentarians want to do - their political and human empathy for the PDL president without putting at risk the functioning of the two houses of parliament. And claims that the charges brought against Berlusconi amounted to a \"coup d'etat\" were dismissed as \"absurd\". Napolitano's intervention has dragged the Italian stock market back, a bit, but the FTSE MIB is still down by 1.5% today. Heads-up, some quotes from Giorgio Napolitano, president of Italy, are hitting the wires. He's criticising Silvio Berlulsconi's supporters who have talked about resigning, and blasted the suggestion that the former PM is a victium of a \"coup d'\u00e9tat\". 26-Sep-2013 12:12 - ITALY PRESIDENT NAPOLITANO SAYS CENTRE-RIGHT THREAT TO RESIGN FROM PARLIAMENT IS DISTURBING AND WOULD UNDERMINE FUNCTIONING OF CHAMBER 26-Sep-2013 12:13 - ITALY PRESIDENT NAPOLITANO SAYS THERE IS STILL TIME TO FIND ANOTHER WAY TO EXPRESS SUPPORT FOR BERLUSCONI WITHOUT UNDERMINING PARLIAMENT 26-Sep-2013 12:14 - ITALY PRESIDENT NAPOLITANO SAYS TALK THAT BERLUSCONI CONVICTION IS \"COUP D'ETAT\" OR \"SUBVERSION\" IS ABSURD 26-Sep-2013 12:16 - ITALY PRESIDENT NAPOLITANO SAYS NEITHER HEAD OF STATE NOR GOVERNMENT CAN INTERFERE WITH APPLICATION OF COURT SENTENCE Italian borrowing costs are rising as bond traders react to the latest political instability in Rome (see 10.31am). The price on Italian 10-year bonds has fallen, pushing up the yield (interest rate) by eight basis points to 4.32% (from 4.24% last night). That suggests nervousness that Silvio Berlusconi's allies could pull the plug on Enrico Letta's government. Our Dublin correspondent, Henry McDonald, has news of more job creation in Ireland: Another day another new jobs announcement in the Irish IT and financial sector. Dell Financial Services has created 200 new posts today at its operation in Cherrywood Business Park in South Dublin. It follows the new 100 jobs announced by Twitter in the city yesterday. Minister for Enterprise and Innovation Richard Bruton joined the Industrial Development Authority at the plant to unveil Dell's latest investment in the Irish workforce with its new banking arm established on the site. Bruton's fellow Fine Gael TD who represents the areas, Mary Mitchell O'Connor, claims her government is now creating 3,000 jobs a month as part of its Action Plan For Jobs. The EC is refusing to back down to George Osborne over its plans to cap bankers' bonuses. Commission officials are telling reporters at the midday briefing in Brussels that the legal action launched yesterday by the UK (full story here) will not derail its own plans. It's not just the UK where house prices in the capital are rising sharply. Data just released showed that residential prices rose 2.8% year-on-year in August, the best reading in six years. Prices in Dublin are up by 10%. ANSA, the Italian newswire, has details of the political unrest in Italy: Italian President Giorgio Napolitano said Thursday that he considered \"institutionally disturbing\" the threat made Wednesday by lawmakers in Silvio Berlusconi's Forza Italia (FI) party to quit en masse if the ex-premier is stripped of his parliamentary seat after the supreme court upheld a tax-fraud conviction against him. The resignation of the FI members in the Lower House and the Senate would cause Premier Enrico Letta's fragile left-right grand-coalition government to collapse. Napolitano expressed his concern about the FI threat in a statement explaining why he could not attend a convention at the Senate. More here: President 'disturbed' by Forza Italia's quit threat Developments in Italy in the last few minutes -- the country's president has pulled out of an appearance today, due to a \"sudden\" and \"disturbing\" political development. Giorgio Napolitano was due to appear at a conference in Rome. But, in a note to the organisers, he said: I would have participated in today's conference if yesterday there had not been a sudden political development that is institutionally disturbing and which requires all my attention today. The Italian stock market is falling fast, down 2%, on fears that Enrico Letta's government might be destabilising. Last night, members of Silvio Berlusconi's PDL party threatened to resign if their leader was expelled from the Italian Senate over his tax fraud conviction. A special Senate committee meeting is scheduled for October 4 to decide whether Berlusconi should lose his seat. A close aid of Berlusconi, Renato Brunetta, said last night after a party meeting that: There was no proposal for mass resignation. We have only asked each parliamentarian to reflect on and decide according to his or her conscience. Italian media has been gripped by the unfolding drama, as Reuters sums up: How serious the threat is difficult to assess following a series of contradictory signals from Berlusconi's allies in parliament, who are divided between a faction of hardliners and more conciliatory doves. On Thursday, Transport Minister Maurizio Lupi said there was no joint commitment to stand down by the centre-right and any decision to resign would be up to individual deputies.\"The resignation of the parliamentarians is a decision which will depend on the conscience of each individual,\" he told RAI state radio. However, the centre-left Democratic Party (PD) said the threats risked undermining the government as it grapples with problems such as its strained public finances to the fate of Italian companies including Telecom Italia TLIT.MI and national carrier Alitalia. Unfortunately, this back and forth with threats weakens an equilibrium which is already very delicate,\" Luigi Zanda, Senate floor leader of the PD, told the daily Corriere della Sera newspaper. And here's some analyst comment on the UK GDP figures: Jonathan Pryor, Investec Corporate Treasury: The final revision to UK GDP growth for Q2 was released as expected and in line with previous forecasts at up 0.7%, helped by better consumer spending. However the year on year figure was reduced by 0.2% to 1.5%, which combined with the current account deficit coming out \u00a32bn wider than consensus at \u00a313bn, led to some of sterling\u2019s momentum being checked. Nevertheless the economy that has shown encouraging progress in the past quarter which also bodes well for the third quarter figures. Jeremy Cook, chief economist at the foreign exchange company, World First: Manufacturing, construction and services industries all contributed positively in Q2, but we are looking for a slowdown in consumer expenditure into Christmas alongside a dip in manufacturing output as export market growth also slows. Business investment is the main negative from today\u2019s release with the figure 2.7% lower on the quarter and 8.5% versus a year ago. Nancy Curtin, Chief Investment Officer, Close Brothers Asset Management comments: GDP hasn\u2019t been revised upwards again, but the confirmation of 0.7% growth highlights that the UK seems to have really turned a corner. Confronted with the threat of a triple dip earlier this year, the economy is now heading towards growth, particularly in the service sector, and this is being reflected in more recent data. This upturn coincides with a housing market resurgence, encouraged by London-led growth and, crucially, signs of an improvement in incomes are finally starting to follow. This increase in wages is good for the overall health of the UK economy, and should bolster consumer spending \u2013 which in turn will underpin the performance of the service sector \u2013 as well as companies\u2019 profitability. Here's some graphs putting today's GDP data into context, via Twitter: Separately, the UK current account deficit was \u00a313bn in the second quarter, worse than forecasts of a \u00a312bn shortfall. That's helped to send the pound down around 0.25% against the US dollar. Today's UK GDP data also shows a 1.5% rise in household disposable income in the April-June quarter -- is that a sign of wages creeping higher in recent months? The ONS also confirmed that all sections of the UK economy grew in the last quarter, contributing to the 0.7% rise in GDP. Service sector output rose by 0.6%, Construction by 1.9%, and Manufacturing by 0.9%. However, the ONS has revised down its forecast for year-on-year growth, reporting that the UK's recovery over the last year has been weaker. It now says the UK economy only grew by 1.3% over the last 12 months, not 1.5% as initially thought. In a flurry of revisions, the ONS has: Revised DOWN the growth in the third quarter of 2012 to +0.6%, from +0.7% Revised UP the contraction in the fourth quarter of 2012, to -0.3% from -0.2%. Revised UP the growth in the first quarter of 2013, to +0.4% from +0.3% and then made no change to growth in the second quarter of 2013, at +0.7% Breaking: UK GDP data for the second quarter of 2013 is unrevised, with the Office for National Statistics confirming growth of +0.7% in the last three months. The credit squeeze in the Eurozone continues. New data released by the European Central Bank showed that loans to the private sector shank by another 2.0%, in August, compared to July. That shows the ECB's efforts to stimulate borrowing through keeping interst rates at record lows aren't reviving lending in the euro area. It looks like banks are reluctant to lend, and businesses cautious about extending their credit. Howard Archer of IHS Global Insight called the figures \"disappointing\", and it's hard to argue. Banks likely believe the economic situation and outlook in many Eurozone countries still provides an uncertain and risky backdrop in which to lend despite the Eurozone finally exiting prolonged recession in the second quarter. Meanwhile, with Eurozone economic activity still limited and business confidence hardly buoyant despite recent improvement, demand for credit currently remains generally muted. Just 20 minutes until we get the final official estimate of UK GDP data for the second quarter of 2013. It currently stands at +0.7% -- could growth be revised higher? Greece's deputy minister has claimed that the country will not need a third bailout -- just some 'debt reprofiling' to ease its way back to recovery. Speaking in New York last night, Evangelos Venizelos argued that Greece could return to the financial markets as planned -- if its partners would just help by improving the terms of its debt. Venizelos told Reuters that Athens was determined not hit the IMF or fellow European nations with losses, saying: We understand very, very well how difficult it is for every government to accept debt relief. ... Our demand is not debt relief. It is additional reprofiling without problem, without additional burden for our institutional partners Debt reprofiling may sound rather less serious than a bailout -- more of a trim than a savage haircut. But in practice, extending Greece's repayment terms or lowering the interest rate on its debt would still hit bondholders in the pocket. The former finance minister also warned that Greece cannot swallow further austerity: We are talking about the potential for a lost generation here \"It is not possible to implement new fiscal measures. It is not possible to impose new cuts on wages and pensions. More here Over in Greece, a clear-up operation is underway outside a tax office in Kifisia, the northen suburb of Athens, after a bomb exploded in the early hours of the morning. No-one was hurt, with the explosion breaking windows and causing some damage to the entrance of the office. More details here. Europe's stock markets are all down this morning, weighed down by those US fears. They're sagging rather than sliding -- the main indices are off around 0.3%: Michael Hewson of CMC Markets blames the \"political wrangling\" in America, and warns that the debt ceiling showdown could prompt Moody's to slash the US credit rating: It looks like it is politics that are once again driving what equity markets are doing, and this time it is US politicians who are unsettling markets with their unerring capability of turning a drama into a crisis. We saw this play out in 2011 and it looks like history is repeating itself as continued political bickering over the raising of the debt ceiling is understandably making investors nervous in what is becoming a classic case of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu. Only this time it is ratings agency Moody\u2019s who warned a couple of days ago that a government shutdown could well be considered a credit negative event. Moody\u2019s currently has the US on a triple \u201cA\u201d rating with stable outlook, unlike Fitch who have a negative outlook and S&amp;P who have them on the next rating down after the debt ceiling debacle in August 2011. It was a nervous day's trading in Australia, although the main stock market index finished a little higher. The US debt ceiling talks, and the prospect of a goverment shutdown, were to blame. Reuters reports: Investors are worried about two looming Washington deadlines: before Oct. 1 Congress needs to pass stop-gap funding for federal agencies and by Oct. 17 it must raise the federal borrowing limit to avoid a debt default by the United States. \"We are entering a seasonally weak period for stocks, being the end of September and October,\" said Tim Radford, global analyst at Rivkin Securities in a note to clients. \"In the backdrop there are major fundamental catalysts that could send stocks sharply lower over the next month,\" Radford said. Utility firm Centrica is the biggest faller on the FTSE 100 again, off another 2.3% -- as the ongoing row over energy prices rumbles on. Peter Mandelson criticises Ed Miliband's energy plan Some interesting corporate news this morning: Ladbrokes shares have tumbled 9% in early trading, after it warned investors that its digital revenues won't hit forecasts this year, or even get close. It now expects profits of between \u00a310m and \u00a314m from online betting -- not the \u00a327.5m analysts were expecting. The company has fallen behind rivals on the web, and CEO Richard Glynn admitted the transition as it tries to catch up online has had a \"greater disruptive influence\" than expected. Tricky, this web lark. Statement here. And in the holiday world, Thomas Cook reported that trading was slower this year than in 2012, with less demand for late bookings. Its shares are down 7% this morning, even though profits are in line. But TUI Travel is doing better. The world's biggest travel operator raised its profit forecasts this morning, reporting stronger demand for holidays in Britain and Nordic countries. Another sign of economic revival? TUI reported that demand for winter trips was holding up well, although bookings from France are down by 26% (even excluding Egypt). Shares up 2.3% Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial market, the eurozone and the business world. It's starting to feel a lot like the summer of 2011. America is heading into another debt ceiling showdown, and investors are getting jittery that the shenanigans in Washington could actually push the US close to a default. Last night, Treasury secretary Jack Lew raised the stakes by warning that the US government could effectively run out of money on October 17, earlier than we thought. Lew also claimed that the financial markets were too relaxed about the prospect that the $16.7bn debt ceiling is hiked swiftly, saying: I think if you look at the calm out there, it's a bit greater than it should be. The sense is that 2011 was a terrible experience and nobody would do that again. Just the way to get investors worried. Pressure is building on Capitol Hill, where Republicans are trying to eviscerate President Obama's healthcare bill in return for allowing the $16.7trn statutory limit on government borrowing to be increased again. A vote on the debt ceiling could come as early as Friday, Republican leaders said last night. There's also a scramble to avoid a government shutdown at October 1, unless Congress comes up with emergency funds. The Senate is expected to vote on legislation to avoid a shutdown on Sunday. Last night the S&amp;P 500 closed lower for the fifth day in a row -- its longest losing streak of the year. So far, investors in Asia and Europe are sitting tight, with no sign of panic yet. After all, the US government has shut down on 17 occasions (!) since 1976 without calamity. But as Chris Weston of IG explains, traders fear it will gum up the wheels of monetary policy: The issue for markets is not just around any impact a shutdown could have around growth, which in effect is actually very minimal. Easily the bigger impact will be on the future of US monetary policy. Traders, economists, strategists and investors alike have either given up guessing when the Fed will taper or will make up its mind depending on the upcoming data. The thing is, if we do see a government shutdown, then subsequently government produced data will be held back from release, and thus we won\u2019t get the October 4 non-farm payrolls, which is so important to the taper jigsaw; clarity and uncertainty would get that little bit hazier. So, we're expecting another edgy day in the markets. Elsewhere, we get revised GDP data for the UK and the US for the second quarter of 2013 -- could growth be revised higher? And in Greece, the government will continue to hold talks with the Troika, in the aftermath of last night's anti-fascist protests. I'll be covering all the key developments through the day as usual....",

Investment income tends to be quite volatile, helping to explain the particularly big deficit of more than 5% of GDP racked up in the first quarter of 2013. But given the competitive boost provided by the 25% fall in the value of the pound between 2007 and 2009, there has been only a modest decline in the deficit on trade in goods and services.</p> <p>The hollowing out of Britain's manufacturing base in the past two decades can be illustrated by the fact that the devaluation that followed Black Wednesday in 1992 resulted in healthy trade surpluses for a number of years. Periods of economic growth in the UK are accompanied by bigger trade deficits; worryingly, this one begins with the deficit already averaging \u00a35-6bn a quarter in the first half of 2013.</p> </blockquote> <h2>More here:&#xa0;<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/economics-blog/2013/sep/26/growing-economy-beware-warning-trade-deficits\">A growing economy, but beware the red warning sign of trade deficits</a></h2> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2013-09-26T12:54:28.317Z\">at 1.54pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-524429b9e4b025976cb65c80\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-09-26T12:37:13.523Z\">1.37pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Encouraging signals from the US jobs market</strong>.</p> <p>The weekly unemployment data shows that 305,000 people signed on for unemployment benefit last week, a drop on the 310,000 who filed initial claims the previous week.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-524428ece4b0685054aa3046\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-09-26T12:34:00.669Z\">1.34pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">US GDP data released</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>There's a flood of US data on the wires.</p> <p>First, US GDP data has been released, c<strong>onfirming that America's economy grew by 2.5%</strong> in the second quarter of this year, on an annualised basis (so around 0.6% quarter-on-quarter).</p> <p>Economists had expected a small upward revision, to 2.6%.</p> <p>The repost also shows that inflation fell by 0.1% during the quarter -- which may indicate firms struggled to raise prices.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-52441ed7e4b025976cb65c7c\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-09-26T12:01:54.658Z\">1.01pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Italian president blasts Berlusconi allies over quit threats</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Italian President Giorgio Napolitano</strong> has let rip at <strong>Silvio Berlusconi's</strong> centre-right allies in the statement issued a few minutes ago.</p> <p>The 88-year-old head of state has not minced his words as he responded to the threat from the PDL members to resign.

However the year on year figure was reduced by 0.2% to 1.5%, which combined with the current account deficit coming out \u00a32bn wider than consensus at \u00a313bn, led to some of&#xa0;sterling\u2019s momentum being checked.</p> <p>Nevertheless the economy that has shown encouraging progress in the past quarter which also bodes well for the third quarter figures.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Jeremy Cook, chief economist at the foreign exchange company, World First:</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Manufacturing, construction and services industries all contributed positively in Q2, but we are looking for a slowdown in consumer expenditure into Christmas alongside a dip in manufacturing output as export market growth also slows.</p> <p>Business investment is the main negative from today\u2019s release with the figure 2.7% lower on the quarter and 8.5% versus a year ago.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Nancy Curtin, Chief Investment Officer, Close Brothers Asset Management comments</strong>:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>GDP hasn\u2019t been revised upwards again, but the confirmation of 0.7% growth highlights that the UK seems to have really turned a corner. Confronted with the threat of a triple dip earlier this year, the economy is now heading towards growth, particularly in the service sector, and this is being reflected in more recent data.</p> <p>This upturn coincides with a housing market resurgence, encouraged by London-led growth and, crucially, signs of an improvement in incomes are finally starting to follow. This increase in wages is good for the overall health of the UK economy, and should bolster consumer spending \u2013 which in turn will underpin the performance of the service sector \u2013 as well as companies\u2019 profitability. </p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/dsmitheconomics/statuses/383153545421144064\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>Big disappointment in the figures is Q2 drop in business investment, down 2.7% on quarter and 8.5% on year earlier: <a href=\"http://t.co/A093E3xuxu\">http://t.co/A093E3xuxu</a></p>&mdash; David Smith (@dsmitheconomics) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/dsmitheconomics/statuses/383153545421144064\">September 26, 2013</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5243f5fae4b090a5419bf93f\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-09-26T08:59:02.859Z\">9.59am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Graphs: UK GDP explained</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Here's some graphs putting today's GDP data into context, via Twitter:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/EdConwaySky/statuses/383151568867966976\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>UK nominal GDP (eg inc inflation) is rising 3.5% a yr.

America is heading into another debt ceiling showdown, and investors are getting jittery that the shenanigans in Washington could actually push the US close to a default.</p> <p>Last night, Treasury secretary <strong>Jack Lew</strong> raised the stakes by warning that the US government could effectively run out of money on October 17, earlier than we thought.</p> <p><strong>Lew</strong> also claimed that the financial markets were too relaxed about the prospect that the&#xa0;$16.7bn debt ceiling is hiked swiftly, saying:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I think if you look at the calm out there, it's a bit greater than it should be.</p> <p>The sense is that 2011 was a terrible experience and nobody would do that again.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Just the way to get investors worried.</strong></p> <p>Pressure is building on Capitol Hill, where Republicans are trying to eviscerate President Obama's healthcare bill in return for allowing the&#xa0;$16.7trn statutory limit on government borrowing to be increased again. A vote on the debt ceiling could come as early as Friday,&#xa0;Republican leaders <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/09/25/us-usa-fiscal-idUSBRE98N11220130925\">said last night</a>.</p> <p>There's also a scramble to avoid a government shutdown at&#xa0;October 1, unless Congress comes up with emergency funds. The Senate is expected to vote on legislation to avoid a shutdown on Sunday.</p> <p>Last night the <strong>S&amp;P 500</strong> closed lower for the fifth day in a row -- its longest losing streak of the year.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/kitjuckes/statuses/383112926045175808\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>5 down S&amp;P days for the first time since the last time the US looked over a fiscal cliff-edge have shaken up EM currencies, helped Tsies.</p>&mdash; kit juckes (@kitjuckes) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/kitjuckes/statuses/383112926045175808\">September 26, 2013</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>So far, investors in Asia and Europe are sitting tight, with no sign of panic yet. After all, the US government has shut down on 17 occasions (!) since 1976 without calamity.</p> <p>But as <strong>Chris Weston of IG</strong> explains, traders fear it will gum up the wheels of monetary policy:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The issue for markets is not just around any impact a shutdown could have around growth, which in effect is actually very minimal. Easily the bigger impact will be on the future of US monetary policy.</p> <p>Traders, economists, strategists and investors alike have either given up guessing when the Fed will taper or will make up its mind depending on the upcoming data. The thing is, if we do see a government shutdown, then subsequently government produced data will be held back from release, and thus we won\u2019t get the October 4 non-farm payrolls, which is so important to the taper jigsaw; clarity and uncertainty would get that little bit hazier.</p> </blockquote> <p>So, we're expecting another edgy day in the markets.</p> <p>Elsewhere, we get revised GDP data for the UK and the US for the second quarter of 2013 -- could growth be revised higher?</p> <p>And in Greece, the government will continue to hold talks with the Troika, in the aftermath of last night's anti-fascist protests.</p> <p><em>I'll be covering all the key developments through the day as usual....&#xa0;</em></p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2013-09-26T10:32:13.256Z\">at 11.32am BST</time></p>  </div>",

      "bodyText": "The US economy grew at a sluggish 2.5% on an annual rate between April and June according to the latest official measure of the country's economic health. The third and final estimate of gross domestic product (GDP) from the Department of Commerce was unchanged from its last. But it was below economists' forecasts, which had been predicting a slight pickup in the pace of growth. In the January-March quarter, GDP rose by 1.1% and while the latest figure represents a marked improvement it is still weak by historic standards. Economic expansion following the 2008 recession has been the weakest of the post-second world war era. The latest GDP figures came as weekly jobless claims fell to lows unseen since June 2007. For the week ended 20 September, the number of people claiming unemployment benefits for the first time fell to 305,000, down from 309,000 the week before. Economists were expecting a rise to 325,000. The number brought the four-week moving average down to 308,000, the lowest level in more than six years.

      "bodyText": "First the good news. The UK is out of recession and growing robustly. The expansion cuts across the three main sectors of the economy \u2013 services, manufacturing and construction \u2013 and will continue. National output was up by 0.7% in the second quarter of 2013 and a similar sort of performance is on the cards for the third quarter. Given the state of the economy at the end of 2012, George Osborne would have settled for that. The talk of a triple-dip recession has gone for good, not least because revisions to back data from the Office for National Statistics means there was not even a second leg to the deep slump of 2008-09. With the outlook looking slightly better in the eurozone, the growth forecasts from City and academic economists for 2014 look too low and will be revised up over the coming months. This is a new \u2013 and welcome \u2013 experience for the chancellor. But dig a bit deeper into the latest releases from the ONS and the picture looks slightly less rosy. The national accounts for the April to June period of 2013 show that in the latest 12-month period the economy grew slightly slower than previously thought \u2013 1.3% against 1.5%. A third of the increase in output was caused by companies building up stocks, which they will hope to sell over the coming months. Meanwhile, the contributions from consumer spending, trade and investment were revised lower. Business investment was 8.5% lower than in the second quarter of 2013 \u2013 a real cause for concern if the plan is to rebalance the economy. The hope is that the \"animal spirits\" of business will revive after a couple of quarters of strong growth. Higher investment will then kick in, giving the recovery more solid foundations. At the moment, however, there is not much sign of this happening. What's more, the ONS data shows that the pickup in demand has begun with the UK running a sizeable current account deficit. Britain has been consistently in the red since it last ran a current account surplus in 1998, and the underlying trend has got worse in recent years. Across the first two quarters of 2013, the deficit averaged more than 4% of GDP. The current account has three main components \u2013 trade in goods and services, investment income, and transfers to international institutions such as the European Union and the United Nations. Investment income tends to be quite volatile, helping to explain the particularly big deficit of more than 5% of GDP racked up in the first quarter of 2013. But given the competitive boost provided by the 25% fall in the value of the pound between 2007 and 2009, there has been only a modest decline in the deficit on trade in goods and services. The hollowing out of Britain's manufacturing base in the past two decades can be illustrated by the fact that the devaluation that followed Black Wednesday in 1992 resulted in healthy trade surpluses for a number of years. Periods of economic growth in the UK are accompanied by bigger trade deficits; worryingly, this one begins with the deficit already averaging \u00a35-6bn a quarter in the first half of 2013.",

The expansion cuts across the three main sectors of the economy \u2013 services, manufacturing and construction \u2013 and will continue.

With the outlook looking slightly better in the eurozone, the growth forecasts from City and academic economists for 2014 look too low and will be revised up over the coming months.

Regulators hit the Icap money broking firm he runs with huge fines and released pages of embarrassing email exchanges showing offers of a curry night out, a Ferrari and \"bubbly on its way\" in return for moving the yen Libor rate.</p> <p>One of the City's highest profile figures, Spencer was drawn into a political row as the Labour MP John Mann called for his donations to the Conservative party to be handed to the armed forces charities where Libor fines are sent.</p> <p>Labour's vice-chairman Michael Dugher also called for the money to be returned. \"David Cameron fought tooth and nail to avoid launching a proper inquiry into the scandal of rigging interest rates, the very scandal which has now engulfed one of his big donors \u2013 a man who has given him nearly \u00a35m,\" Dugher said. \"It just goes to show what we already knew. In the end it's a privileged few whose voices he hears, and whose interests he acts in.\"</p> <p>Each of the one-time employees \u2013 Darrell Read, who lives in New Zealand, Daniel Wilkinson and \"Lord Libor\", Colin Goodman \u2013 face 30 years in jail for each of the three charges levelled against them by the US department of justice (DoJ). They have been charged with conspiracy to commit wire fraud and two counts of wire fraud. In the US a criminal complaint is not evidence and a defendant is presumed innocent until convicted.</p> <p>Spencer's tenure as treasurer of the Conservative party overlapped with the period of the fines \u2013 between July 2006 and December 2010 \u2013 but he claimed that this was not relevant. Even if he had not been holding the senior political role Spencer said: \"I can't believe I'd have been able to pick it up.\"</p> <p>A Tory official said the demands to repay Spencer's donations were \"nonsense\".</p> <p>Spencer has attended a series of dinners in Downing Street and close links with the party since leaving his post as co-treasurer. Last year he was described as a personal friend of the prime minister by cabinet minister Francis Maude.</p> <p>Spencer described the 10 former and current employees as \"rotten apples\" but acknowledged the desk on which they worked had never been audited during the relevant four-year period.</p> <p>Announcing the latest development in the Libor scandal, which erupted in June 2012 when Barclays was fined \u00a3290m, Scott Hammond, deputy assistant attorney general for the antitrust division's criminal enforcement programme, said: \"In exchange for bigger bonus checks, the three defendants undermined financial markets around the world by compromising the integrity of globally used interest rate benchmarks.\"</p> <p>Icap, in which Spencer and his family own a 16% stake worth \u00a3400m, will pay \u00a314m to the Financial Conduct Authority. It is the FCA's fourth fine for Libor rigging and first against a non-bank. The remainder of the \u00a355m will go the US authorities.</p> <p>According to the FCA one of the brokers received \u00a35,000 every quarter in \"corrupt bonus payments\".</p> <p>The regulators link the activities to those of UBS, the Swiss bank which has so far faced the largest Libor fine of \u00a3940m. The DoJ's complaint names former UBS trader Tom Hayes as a \"co-conspirator\" in its charges against former Icap employees along with \"others known and unknown\".</p> <p>According to the FCA, which does not name individuals, there were 300 written requests to change Libor rates to brokers at Icap, and more orally which were harder to chart.</p> <p>Libor \u2013 the London interbank offered \u2013 is a benchmark rate based on submissions by major banks about the price they think rivals would charge them to borrow money over different periods of time. It in turn is used a benchmark against which \u00a3300tn of financial contracts around the world are set.</p> <p>According to the DoJ, Goodman distributed a daily email to individuals outside of Icap, including derivatives traders at several large banks as well as those responsible for providing Libor submissions to the British Bankers' Association. The BBA is now being stripped of its involvement in the rate.</p> <p>Goodman's email contained what were termed his \"SUGGESTED LIBORS\", purported predictions of where yen Libor ultimately would fix each day across eight specified borrowing periods. Read and Wilkinson, along with Goodman himself, often referred to Goodman as \"Lord Libor\",\" the DoJ said.</p> <p>Spencer did not rule out taking a bonus for this year but said top executive payouts would be affected. \"None of the three individuals at the centre of the activity remains with the firm. Others are either no longer with the company or are being disciplined,\" he added. \"We deeply regret and strongly condemn the inexcusable actions of the brokers who sought to assist certain bank traders in their efforts to manipulate yen Libor.

      "bodyText": "The City dealer run by former Conservative party treasurer Michael Spencer has been fined \u00a355m by regulators and three of its former employees charged with criminal offences in the United States as part of the global investigation into Libor rigging. Spencer said he regretted the actions of the three \u2013 one of whom was known to colleagues as \"Lord Libor\". Regulators hit the Icap money broking firm he runs with huge fines and released pages of embarrassing email exchanges showing offers of a curry night out, a Ferrari and \"bubbly on its way\" in return for moving the yen Libor rate. One of the City's highest profile figures, Spencer was drawn into a political row as the Labour MP John Mann called for his donations to the Conservative party to be handed to the armed forces charities where Libor fines are sent. Labour's vice-chairman Michael Dugher also called for the money to be returned. \"David Cameron fought tooth and nail to avoid launching a proper inquiry into the scandal of rigging interest rates, the very scandal which has now engulfed one of his big donors \u2013 a man who has given him nearly \u00a35m,\" Dugher said. \"It just goes to show what we already knew. In the end it's a privileged few whose voices he hears, and whose interests he acts in.\" Each of the one-time employees \u2013 Darrell Read, who lives in New Zealand, Daniel Wilkinson and \"Lord Libor\", Colin Goodman \u2013 face 30 years in jail for each of the three charges levelled against them by the US department of justice (DoJ). They have been charged with conspiracy to commit wire fraud and two counts of wire fraud. In the US a criminal complaint is not evidence and a defendant is presumed innocent until convicted. Spencer's tenure as treasurer of the Conservative party overlapped with the period of the fines \u2013 between July 2006 and December 2010 \u2013 but he claimed that this was not relevant. Even if he had not been holding the senior political role Spencer said: \"I can't believe I'd have been able to pick it up.\" A Tory official said the demands to repay Spencer's donations were \"nonsense\". Spencer has attended a series of dinners in Downing Street and close links with the party since leaving his post as co-treasurer. Last year he was described as a personal friend of the prime minister by cabinet minister Francis Maude. Spencer described the 10 former and current employees as \"rotten apples\" but acknowledged the desk on which they worked had never been audited during the relevant four-year period. Announcing the latest development in the Libor scandal, which erupted in June 2012 when Barclays was fined \u00a3290m, Scott Hammond, deputy assistant attorney general for the antitrust division's criminal enforcement programme, said: \"In exchange for bigger bonus checks, the three defendants undermined financial markets around the world by compromising the integrity of globally used interest rate benchmarks.\" Icap, in which Spencer and his family own a 16% stake worth \u00a3400m, will pay \u00a314m to the Financial Conduct Authority. It is the FCA's fourth fine for Libor rigging and first against a non-bank. The remainder of the \u00a355m will go the US authorities. According to the FCA one of the brokers received \u00a35,000 every quarter in \"corrupt bonus payments\". The regulators link the activities to those of UBS, the Swiss bank which has so far faced the largest Libor fine of \u00a3940m. The DoJ's complaint names former UBS trader Tom Hayes as a \"co-conspirator\" in its charges against former Icap employees along with \"others known and unknown\". According to the FCA, which does not name individuals, there were 300 written requests to change Libor rates to brokers at Icap, and more orally which were harder to chart. Libor \u2013 the London interbank offered \u2013 is a benchmark rate based on submissions by major banks about the price they think rivals would charge them to borrow money over different periods of time. It in turn is used a benchmark against which \u00a3300tn of financial contracts around the world are set. According to the DoJ, Goodman distributed a daily email to individuals outside of Icap, including derivatives traders at several large banks as well as those responsible for providing Libor submissions to the British Bankers' Association. The BBA is now being stripped of its involvement in the rate. Goodman's email contained what were termed his \"SUGGESTED LIBORS\", purported predictions of where yen Libor ultimately would fix each day across eight specified borrowing periods. Read and Wilkinson, along with Goodman himself, often referred to Goodman as \"Lord Libor\",\" the DoJ said. Spencer did not rule out taking a bonus for this year but said top executive payouts would be affected. \"None of the three individuals at the centre of the activity remains with the firm. Others are either no longer with the company or are being disciplined,\" he added. \"We deeply regret and strongly condemn the inexcusable actions of the brokers who sought to assist certain bank traders in their efforts to manipulate yen Libor. Their conduct contravenes all that Icap stands for.\" 'Will buy you a Ferrari if you move 3 month up' Desk head: \"Lord Baliff, I would suggest a lunch over golden week. Monday or Tuesday, if you are around ... As for kickbacks etc, we can discuss that at lunch and I will speak to [senior yen trader] about it next time he comes up for a chat.\" Trader: \"OK with an annual champagne shipment, a few p*** ups \u2026 and a small bonus every now and then.\" Broker: \"How about some form of performance bonus per quarter from your b bonus [sic] pool to me for the Libor service \u2026\" Derivatives broker: \"Morning Lad, on the scrounge again, if possible keep 3 [months] the same and get 6 [months] as high as you can.

But in a belated reaction a day later <strong>Centrica</strong> and <strong>SSE</strong> both lost more than 5% of their value, or almost \u00a32bn between them.</p> <p>The falls are continuing with Centrica currently down 8p at 367.6p, not helped by a downgrade from JP Morgan Cazenove which moved from overweight to neutral and cut its price target from 390p to 375p.</p> <p>SSE meanwhile is down 18p at \u00a314.71. Ronnie Chopra, head of strategy at Tradenext, said:</p> <blockquote> Both these utilities are great cash generators in the current low interest rate environment and the sharp fall this week in their respective share prices may attract predators as both are take-over targets and if the price falls much further no doubt opportunistic bidders will appear. </blockquote> <p>Overall the <strong>FTSE 100</strong> has edged 3.10 points lower to 6548.43, ahead of UK GDP figures.

While it sounds like there's potential for another short-term agreement on the budget (three months, through December) and Obama can ultimately raise the ceiling himself if necessary, the mere threat of a US shutdown and default by the reserve sovereign is enough to hold sentiment back. </blockquote> <p>Among the risers <strong>Tullow Oil</strong> has climbed 11p to \u00a310.64 after announcing a new oil discovery in northern Kenya.

      "bodyText": "Energy companies are falling sharply for the second day running, in the wake of Labour's pledge to freeze prices for 20 months if it is elected. Ed Miliband unveiled the plan at the party's conference on Tuesday, immediately causing a backlash from the companies involved. But in a belated reaction a day later Centrica and SSE both lost more than 5% of their value, or almost \u00a32bn between them. The falls are continuing with Centrica currently down 8p at 367.6p, not helped by a downgrade from JP Morgan Cazenove which moved from overweight to neutral and cut its price target from 390p to 375p. SSE meanwhile is down 18p at \u00a314.71. Ronnie Chopra, head of strategy at Tradenext, said: Both these utilities are great cash generators in the current low interest rate environment and the sharp fall this week in their respective share prices may attract predators as both are take-over targets and if the price falls much further no doubt opportunistic bidders will appear. Overall the FTSE 100 has edged 3.10 points lower to 6548.43, ahead of UK GDP figures. Investors also remain cautious about the US budget problems which could lead to a shutdown in the American government. Mike van Dulken, head of research at Accendo Markets, said: The US running the show as usual, with uncertainty surrounding budget negotiations (deadline 1 October) and the debt ceiling (deadline 17 October) of the world's number one economy keeping optimism in check. While it sounds like there's potential for another short-term agreement on the budget (three months, through December) and Obama can ultimately raise the ceiling himself if necessary, the mere threat of a US shutdown and default by the reserve sovereign is enough to hold sentiment back. Among the risers Tullow Oil has climbed 11p to \u00a310.64 after announcing a new oil discovery in northern Kenya. Angus McCoss, the company's exploration director, said: This success at the Ekales-1 wildcat is further evidence of the exceptional oil potential of our East African rift basin acreage... We are now increasing the pace of exploration in Kenya aiming for twelve wells in the next twelve months.

Thomas Cook, the world's oldest tour operator, said it had experienced slower trading in summer compared with last year, as forecast, and said it expected full-year results to be in line with expectations. But its shares suffered the second biggest fall on the FTSE 250, dropping nearly 7% to 145p, as the travel firm said that UK summer bookings were down 3% on the year, continental sales were flat and northern European sales were down 1% \u2013 despite average selling prices being up in each reported segment. The company said its summer holidays were now over 95% sold but late bookings had slowed compared to last year, when bad weather around much of Europe led to a particularly strong market. Thomas Cook said winter trading had started more slowly across most markets due to warm weather across Europe and recent troubles in Egypt, but the company said the wider range of routes and packages it was offering would help it hit its targets. But Tui Travel, the world's largest tour operator, increased the profit outlook it gave only seven weeks ago due to strong demand in Britain and the Nordic countries of Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway and Sweden for summer holidays. Its shares were the biggest risers in the FTSE 100, gaining just over 2% to 363p.
