      "bodyText": "There's not a lot left of the plan George Osborne had for the economy when he arrived at the Treasury in May 2010. Growth is lower, borrowing higher, the hopes of pre-election tax cuts dashed. All that remains of the original vision is that long-term borrowing costs remain low and the UK's status as a AAA-rated country. On Friday, one of the three ratings agencies \u2013 Standard &amp; Poor's \u2013 said that despite Britain's deepening double-dip recession, there was no immediate threat of a downgrade. Osborne welcomed this news, seeing it as a vindication of government strategy. In reality, a debt downgrade by S&amp;P, Moody's and Fitch would be a boon for Britain, since it would remove the policy straitjacket that has prevented an effective response as the economy has steadily weakened over the past two and a bit years. Throughout this period, the chancellor's mantra has been that only by sticking to his deficit reduction plan will Britain keep the ratings agencies sweet. If he were to shows signs of losing his nerve, a downgrade would follow that would send long-term interest shooting up. This, the chancellor says, would harm the country's growth prospects. Forget for a moment that the ratings agencies forfeited their right to give advice to governments when they gave AAA ratings to the toxic waste spewed out by Wall Street and the City of London in advance of the financial crisis. Ignore the evidence that the sky has not fallen in when other countries have been downgraded. While these are important points to bear in mind, the real problem with allowing policy to be dictated by the ratings agencies is that it is so clearly at odds with the government's vision. This can be summed up quite simply: get the economy moving; meet the targets for deficit reduction; win the 2015 election. As things stand, none of these objectives will be achieved. Osborne is, of course, not the first chancellor to find himself stuck in a policy trap from which he can only escape by losing personal credibility. Harold Wilson's 1964-70 government arrived in power with an ambitious National Plan to boost Britain's growth rate, but by setting its face against a devaluation of the pound from day one ensured that the plan would fail. Twenty years ago, in the summer of 1992, the UK was part of the European Exchange Rate Mechanism, under which the pound's value had to be maintained against the German mark. Interest rates were kept at 10% to achieve this, a level far too high for an economy suffering from record home repossessions and bankruptcies, and with unemployment close to three million. Major and his chancellor, Norman Lamont, insisted there was no alternative to the ERM. They issued blood-curdling warnings that changing course would lead to disaster. In the end, on Black Wednesday, policy was changed for the government by George Soros. Britain was blown out of the ERM, interest rates came down to levels that allowed the economy to grow, the pound sank to levels that enabled firms to export, and a vigorous recovery began almost immediately. The noose around the neck of the economy is not as tight today as it was two decades ago. Then, the disciplines of the ERM meant the government had little freedom to set monetary policy (interest rates and the level of sterling) and it was left to the Treasury to support growth through fiscal policy (tax and public spending). Today, the Bank of England can run an ultra-loose monetary policy by keeping interest rates low and pumping money into the economy through quantitative easing. Osborne believes it has been his deficit reduction strategy that has allowed Sir Mervyn King to keep bank rate at 0.5% for more than three years and to announce \u00a3375bn of quantitative easing. Yet this policy mix is clearly not working because even on the most generous interpretation of the official data the economy has flatlined for the past two years. Households remain debt-saturated and are slowly reducing their borrowing. That means a policy based around making credit cheap and more freely available has severe limitations. Yet the outlook is for more of the same. The City believes that QE could reach \u00a3500bn before the Bank is done, and that there is a chance that bank rate will be cut to 0.25% this autumn. At the same time, Osborne plans to intensify his fiscal squeeze. The yardstick used by the Treasury to assess the success of its deficit reduction plan is the cyclically-adjusted primary balance, which means borrowing excluding interest payments on the national debt, adjusted for the state of the economy. In the 2012-13 financial year, the plan is to tighten policy by 0.3% of national output, rising to about 1.5% of gross domestic product in 2013-14 and 2014-15. Let's assume for a moment that the government no longer felt constrained by the need to keep the credit rating agencies sweet. Would it be sticking to its fiscal strategy and its current policy mix? That hardly seems likely, given the worst double-dip recession in history and a slower recovery than that which followed the Great Depression. Osborne is in the unenviable position of being attacked for his passivity from all sides. Last week he was lambasted from the left by David Blanchflower, a former member of the Bank's monetary policy committee, by Mark Littlewood, the director general of the free-market Institute of Economic Affairs, by Brendan Barber, general secretary of the TUC and by Sir Richard Lambert, the former director general of the employers' organisation, the CBI. It is not that difficult to sketch out an alternative economic approach. The government can borrow cheaply so it could give the green light to infrastructure projects, particularly small-scale projects such as schools and local transport initiatives, where work can begin quickly. It should tackle youth unemployment by scrapping national insurance contributions for all those under 25 and bring in lower NICs for the northern regions. Learning from the big retailers, there should be additional time-limited spending vouchers for those on benefits to stimulate consumer spending. Consideration should be given to a temporary cut in VAT, which would bring down inflation, and increase spending power. For the longer term, there should be a national investment bank. As Michael Saunders of Citigroup puts it: \"The ultra-low level of gilt yields is practically an invitation for the government to borrow more\". He notes that Osborne could implement temporary tax cuts and extra public investment worth 1% of GDP (about \u00a315bn) while maintaining the squeeze on current spending, which would still result in fiscal tightening of nearly 0.5% of GDP in 2013-14. The International Monetary Fund has provided the political cover for the government to re-think its bone-headed adherence to a failed strategy that is making the deep-seated problems of the economy worse, not better. The change, of course, should happen immediately, although it may take a debt downgrade to remove the self-imposed shackles. For now, Osborne is digging the economy \u2013 and himself \u2013 deeper into a hole.",

But I believe it will happen ... even if it is a lot more slower than we thought.\"</p> <p>Despite all the talk earlier in the year that Qatar was being lined up to step in to invest in RBS, Hester said the bank was inextricably linked to the economy, which will need to grow before the shares start to rise.</p> <p>Taxpayers are currently losing more than half the \u00a345bn invested in the shares during the bailout although Hester has indicated that the first sale of the shares could take place at a loss.</p>",

He wants the bank to focus on \"putting customers first\", which is hard to accept perhaps for those at RBS, NatWest and Ulster caught up in the computer meltdown, some of whom incurred problems again last week. \"An element of banks became detached from society around it, an element was for traders making money for themselves or the banks, and customers [were] the means of making money. We have to be sure that banks do it the other way around.\" He added: \"RBS has seen a big mushrooming in spending on technology. With hindsight maybe a bit more of that increase in spend should have been in the core taken-for-granted systems that work every day. Some of our focus was on the new things people want,\" Hester said. He is reluctant to pre-judge an ongoing investigation, but stresses that any warnings about impending computer disaster had not reached board level. Hester has 18 months left to go of his \"clean up\" operation of a bank that made record \u00a324bn losses in 2008, after which many banking sources believe he will leave RBS. The clean up will move a step closer to completion later this year when he expects the bank to exit the asset protection scheme, set up to insure some \u00a3300bn of the bank's most toxic assets. But, even then, any attempts to sell off some 90bn shares will take time. \"The process of the taxpayer getting its money is going to be longer and slower than we hoped in the past because the economy is recovering slower and the regulatory picture has changed. But I believe it will happen ... even if it is a lot more slower than we thought.\" Despite all the talk earlier in the year that Qatar was being lined up to step in to invest in RBS, Hester said the bank was inextricably linked to the economy, which will need to grow before the shares start to rise. Taxpayers are currently losing more than half the \u00a345bn invested in the shares during the bailout although Hester has indicated that the first sale of the shares could take place at a loss.",
