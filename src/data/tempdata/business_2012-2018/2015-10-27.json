      "bodyText": "New figures released by the Australian Bureau of Statistics show that the level of trade union membership in the private sector is now almost one in 10, and although community support for unions remains strong, fewer workers than ever are joining a union. And in a sign of further strife for the union movement, just one in 20 young workers are in a trade union. In less than 25 years, the level of trade union membership has fallen from a point where almost half of all male employees were members, to one where just 14.4% now hold a union card. Where once men were much more likely than women to be in a union, now the latest data from the ABS shows women are slightly more likely to be so \u2013 but only just. It is unlikely anyone down at trades hall is going to be in raptures over hearing that 15.9% of women workers are in a trade union. And just in case there was any solace for union organisers to be gained from those figures, the bad news is those figures are actually the good news. In the past, the ABS has asked only employees and owner managers of incorporated enterprises whether or not they were in a trade union. In the latest figures, the ABS has also asked the owner-managers of unincorporated enterprises, which numbers about 1.2 million workers. Including this number drops the total penetration of trade union membership from 15.1% to 13.8%. And just in case that number isn\u2019t bleak enough, it gets worse when it is broken down into the public and private sectors. While public sector workers make up just 13.8% of all workers, they account for 37% of all trade unionists. Trade unionism remains extremely strong within the public sector, with 39% of such workers being in a union. But a mere 11% of private sector workers are in a union: And where once the manufacturing industry was a union stronghold, as employment in the sector has declined over the past quarter century, perhaps by no coincidence so too has its union membership. Now just 12.4% of manufacturing workers are in a union, below the total worker average. The figures show the importance for the union movement not just of the public sector but of those industries in which the public sector dominates. Education and the health and social assistance industries are among the highest for union membership. If you exclude those two industries, and the public administration and safety industry, the level of trade union membership falls to a pitiful 8.7%. And just in case any trade unions are thinking \u201cOh well, there\u2019s always tomorrow\u201d, the figures show tomorrow looks even worse. The biggest penetration of trade union workers is among those aged 55 to 64. And there is a clear trend of declining union membership and age. Only 4.9% of workers aged 15-19 are in a union: Now it perhaps is understandable that youth would not be in a union, given they are more likely to work in casual jobs, but the figures even beyond this youngest age do not suggest a big shift towards unionism. Indeed, once the generation of workers who began work in the late 1970s and early 1980s, when unionism was common \u2013 and indeed in some sectors compulsory \u2013 it is likely the numbers of union workers will fall well below the OECD average, and towards the level of the US, which is already about 10%: The data shows that aside from being in the public sector, union members are more likely to work in a job with paid leave entitlements: Ninety two per cent of union workers have paid leave, compared with 66% of those workers who are not in a union. The interesting question is what drives what: are the type of jobs which have paid leave more likely to attract those who would join a union, or is it the case that being in a union makes one more likely to get paid leave as part of your employment? Certainly the preponderance of public sector unionists would suggest the work attracts the type of people who would join a union, but certainly unions would argue the strong union presence helps keep those industries from becoming ones with a high percentage of contract or casual workers. The odd thing about the low union figures released on Tuesday is that on the same day polling company Essential Report released figures which showed that 62% of Australians believe unions are important, and this belief has grown since 2012: Only 21% of those polled by Essential believe unions were not very important, less than the 27% who believed this in 2012. Even more at odds with the minuscule numbers of actual trade union members, the Essential report found that 45% of Australians believed workers would be better off were unions stronger: Just 26% believed workers would be worse off if unions were stronger. Such figures may suggest that there are a lot of free riders in the work force \u2013 those who want a strong union movement but who don\u2019t want to contribute. It\u2019s a bit like those who say they believe in God and think Australia\u2019s Judeo-Christian heritage is important but who don\u2019t go to church. But perhaps the answer lies in the breakdown of how much better off people believe they would be with a stronger union. Seventeen per cent believe workers would be \u201ca lot better off\u201d with a stronger union movement in Australia. That is pretty much the same level as the 15% of employees who are already in a union. But 28% think a stronger union movement would only make workers \u201ca little bit better off\u201d. Among the many challenges for the union movement, the first would be to convince these 28% that the little bit is worth joining the union and that perhaps were they to do so the benefits would actually be much greater. But the data over the past quarter of a century would suggest the union movement has struggled to do this, and without drastic change looks unlikely to do so in the future.",

    "webTitle": "Uber Rush could bring delivery relief for New York and San Francisco's small business owners", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "For Lisa Chu, owner of Los Angeles-based clothing company Black N Bianco, offering same day delivery to her clients hasn\u2019t traditionally made financial or logistical sense. \u201cI have a lot of small boutiques that carry my clothing in the southern California area, and whenever they need a specific size in a rush I can never fulfill their needs,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s not viable enough for me to hire a driver and I cannot let my employees waste time delivering one item.\u201d But that may soon change with the launch of a new delivery service unveiled last week by on-demand taxi company Uber, which aims to make it simpler and more affordable for small businesses to deliver their products quickly, helping bring them at least a little closer to competing with retail giants like Amazon and Target. The new service, called Uber Rush, allows local merchants to tap into a network of drivers for almost instantaneous pickup and delivery of their products, be it flowers or tacos or a handbag, at a relatively small cost. The service, which has existed in pilot stage in New York City for the past year, has now expanded to San Francisco and Chicago, with plans to extend to other cities in the future. Chris Webb, CEO and co-founder of restaurant online ordering platform ChowNow, one of Uber Rush\u2019s partners, said the new service will enable small businesses to tap into a large network of local delivery drivers with the click of a button, allowing them to fulfill more orders and save on costs. \u201cDelivery can be a financial and logistical pain point for restaurants as hourly wages are going up, insurance rates continue to climb, and staffing around lunch and dinner demand spikes has always been a challenge,\u201d he said. \u201cBecause of these challenges, only half of our restaurant clients offer delivery today and we aim to help resolve this pain point with the Uber Rush integration.\u201d Small business owners have struggled to keep up with larger companies, who continue to roll out faster and cheaper delivery options to their customers. Earlier this year, Amazon launched free same-day delivery to subscribers of its Prime membership program. Last month, the National Federation of Independent Businesses found that optimism continues to be low among small businesses compared to August. Merchants cited poor sales and competition from large businesses as some of the biggest problems that they face, after taxes, governmental red tape and poorly skilled workers. To use Uber Rush, local merchants input a customer\u2019s order into an online form, then a courier arrives shortly after to deliver the package. Delivery costs vary depending on the city, but range from $5 to $6 within one mile and between $2 and $2 per extra mile, according to Uber\u2019s website. Businesses and their customers can view where their package is in real time using an online map. \u201cWe used to wait two to three hours for a delivery to start,\u201d said Olivier Plusquellec, co-founder of New York City florist Ode \u00e0 la Rose, which was featured on the Uber Rush website. \u201cWith Uber Rush, now it\u2019s five or ten minutes.\u201d But Uber Rush carries some potential downsides, said John Morgan, the Oliver and Dolores Williamson professor of organizations at University of California Berkeley Haas School of Business. For one, there is the risk that delicate items like flowers or food will suffer in transit due to careless drivers, Morgan said. There\u2019s also the issue of price, he added. Uber drivers may want to bunch orders to make the trip more worthwhile financially, which would decrease the speed of delivery. \u201cUber has shown itself to be a very competent market platform for matching rides with riders and figuring out the right price to make both parties semi-happy,\u201d Morgan said. \u201cBut when it comes to logistics and delivery, direct participation and central control is critical, hence I am skeptical of Uber\u2019s \u2018invisible hand\u2019 approach in this sphere.\u201d But the high costs and logistical challenges of traditional delivery have left small businesses with few options, so on-demand services like Uber Rush at least give local merchants a chance to remain in the race. For Chu, the new service will enable her to to serve all her boutiques on demand, giving her a leg-up on her Amazon competitors, who she said don\u2019t offer same-day delivery. \u201cUber Rush is a God-sent gift,\u201d she said. \u201cIt will differentiate my brand and bring reliability to a whole new level.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Sixty is the magic number, at least for BP. The oil firm has drawn up its financial plan for the next two years and it revolves around the price of oil settling at around $60 per barrel. There is a slight problem with this \u2013 in the past three months the average price of a barrel was about $50. However, that did not stop boss Bob Dudley hailing the company\u2019s decisiveness in its third quarter results. In a perverse sense, the Deepwater Horizon disaster has done BP a favour. The cost of the 2010 oil spill and the pressure it put on the company mean that BP had already sold nearly $50bn (\u00a333bn) of assets by the time the price of oil crashed last year. Many of these assets were sold with the price of oil above $100, so the outcome was far better than if the company had been forced to cut back now. However, as BP cuts capital expenditure to between $17bn and $19bn a year, compared with predictions of $24bn to $26bn a year ago, unsettling questions remain about its future. While Dudley and his highly regarded chief financial officer, Brian Gilvary, have steadied the ship, what comes next and what is left? The company has some exciting projects in the pipeline, including further sites in the Gulf of Mexico, and BP claims that 80% of the projects it is yet to start can make money with the price of oil at $60 per barrel. Yet BP is surely taking a gamble by steadfastly refusing to cut its dividend and instead reducing capital expenditure to adjust to the new world. Spending has already been scaled back dramatically, owing to Deepwater Horizon. BP may be one of the world\u2019s biggest dividend payers, but pension funds are likely to curse disappointing growth in the long term more than a short-term cut to the dividend to cope with extraordinary oil-price fluctuations. In any other sector, we would think that management was mad. VW driving into unchartered territory Volkswagen posts its own third-quarter results on Wednesday 28 October, and \u2013 surprise, surprise \u2013 they are likely to be shocking. The world\u2019s second biggest carmaker is expected to post its first quarterly loss in more than 15 years. The consensus among analysts is that VW will report an operating loss of \u20ac3.3bn (\u00a32.4bn), down from a profit of \u20ac3.2bn a year ago, according to Bloomberg. However, more interesting than the numbers will be the comments from new boss, Michael Mueller, as he faces the media and investors for the first time. First, Mueller could offer his thoughts on the total cost of the scandal to VW. The third-quarter loss is the result of a \u20ac6.5bn charge VW has booked to meet the cost of the diesel-emissions scandal, but the company has already admitted this will not be enough. The charge suggests that the cost to VW will be less than \u20ac600 for every car affected, which is laughable given that some of the vehicles require hardware charges and the company faces big compensation claims. Moody\u2019s, the credit-rating agency, has said the cost to VW will eventually be between \u20ac9.5bn and \u20ac31bn. But second, the fact that Mueller will talk at all is interesting. His predecessor, Martin Winterkorn, who quit as a result of the emissions scandal, used to get his chief financial officer to answers questions on results day. That says it all about the shocking corporate governance at VW before it was dragged to its knees. Carpetright laying the foundations Forget GDP and the boffins over at the Office for National Statistics, the real bellwether for the British economy is Carpetright. Ask most retail bosses and they will tell you that the growth in GDP over the last couple of years has not really translated to the high street. Household incomes have remained squeezed and trading has been tough, including for Carpetright. However, Carpetright\u2019s latest figures show that like-for-like sales rose 4% in the six months to the end of October. This boost is partly due to self-help measures such as closing stores \u2013 including 22 in the first half of its financial year \u2013 and introducing interest-free credit. However, this performance was against a strong uptick in the same period last year \u2013 when the self-help measures kicked in \u2013 and total sales for Carpetright still rose 2.5% despite the fact that it operated from fewer stores. This suggests that new homeowners are investing in their homes, but also that existing owners are willing to modernise their properties. After Travis Perkins warned of a potential slowdown in DIY last week, this is welcome news about consumer confidence.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The government has pledged to help the struggling British steel industry compete with foreign rivals by backing measures including a lowering of energy costs and reducing business rates. Anna Soubry, the small business, industry and enterprise minister, said she would act on five demands from the industry to stave off further job losses in a sector that has seen thousands of redundancies since September. \u201cThe industry is not asking the government for any money. All they want from us is to give them the chance to compete on a level playing field,\u201d she told a committee of MPs. \u201cIt\u2019s not the job of government to tie people up. All these guys are looking for is a level playing field and I agree with them.\u201d She added: \u201cI have an absolute determination to keep steel in this country.\u201d The five actions sought by the industry are: the implementation of an energy compensation package to bring down the cost of energy to that enjoyed by rivals; the reduction of business rates in line with those of competitor countries; more time to meet directives on emissions; more support on anti-steel dumping measures; and more support for local producers in large construction projects, although EU rules bar domestic bias in government procurement decisions. Asked if she supported a preference for UK steel suppliers on infrastructure projects even if it led to higher construction costs, Soubry said: \u201cI would say buy British because it\u2019s quality.\u201d The minister was speaking to MPs after the head of UK Steel, the industry trade body, warned the government that the industry was at a critical crossroads and ministers must decide whether they were prepared to do everything they could to prevent further job losses. Sajid Javid, the business secretary, held an emergency steel summit in Rotherham this month, and on Tuesday called for an EU-wide steel meeting. Gareth Stace, director of UK Steel, told a business, innovation and skills select committee hearing: \u201cTime is not on our side.\u201d \u201cEver since the business secretary called for the emergency steel summit two weeks ago the clock has been ticking. Time is rapidly running out and the steel industry needs assurances from government that it is going to deliver on its promises.\u201d The industry is reeling from the double impact of high energy costs and the dumping of steel from heavy producers such as China. Since September, 5,000 jobs have been lost or put at risk after announcements by Tata Steel, the owner of Britain\u2019s largest steel plant in Scunthorpe, and SSI UK, which owns the Redcar steelworks, and Caparo Industries, many of whose subsidiaries have gone into administration. UK steelmakers are seeking compensation, promised in the budget this year, for UK green levies that make the cost of electricity for UK users higher than for their European counterparts. The business secretary has promised to try to negotiate these packages with the European commission, which needs to ensure they do not breach state aid competition rules. Stace said the government had flagged the correct course of action but must follow up its pledges. \u201cMinisters, up to and including the prime minister, are saying the right things about compensation, making sure there is action on unfair dumping of steel and ensuring building projects in the UK use British steel \u2013 but the practical reality is that these measures must be driven home and delivered.\u201d Stace\u2019s pleas were echoed by Luis Sanz, UK chief executive of Celsa Steel, Tor Farquhar, group human resources director for Tata Steel UK, and by Roy Rickhuss, the general secretary of the Community trade union. Farquhar said: \u201cThe margins are very small, so any one issue like energy gets magnified and becomes a problem in a low-margin business.\u201d",

    "webTitle": "Outdoor retailer REI to close its stores on Black Friday", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The holiday season is coming, and there\u2019s a big countdown clock on REI\u2019s website counting the seconds until Black Friday. It\u2019s not for a sale or a big blow-out event. The clock is counting down to the time when most of the outdoor sports retailer\u2019s employees can go out and enjoy the day doing things like hiking, running and whatever else they like. The #optoutside campaign was announced on Monday, when Jerry Stritzke, president and CEO of Recreational Equipment Inc, emailed employees and co-op members to say that REI will close on Black Friday \u2013 the biggest shopping day of the year. \u201cOn November 27, we\u2019ll be closing all 143 of our stores and paying our employees to head outside,\u201d announced Stritzke, who runs the largest consumer co-op. REI has about 5.5 million co-op members. \u201cFor 76 years, our co-op has been dedicated to one thing and one thing only: a life outdoors. We believe that being outside makes our lives better. And Black Friday is the perfect time to remind ourselves of this essential truth.\u201d While many Americans receive paid time off for Thanksgiving Thursday and the following Friday, those working in retail usually do not. Black Friday, as the holiday Friday has come to be known, is one of the largest consumer holidays as Americans begin their Christmas shopping. To spread the word about its campaign to get people outside instead of to the stores on Black Friday, REI launched an #optoutside hashtag on Twitter and released a video featuring Stritzke. After REI announced its campaign, supporters flocked to Twitter calling it on brand. Some, however, expressed skepticism over whether the typical REI consumer was likely to spend Black Friday shopping to begin with. In the past, Black Friday has been among top 10 sales days for REI, Stritzke told USA Today. According to him, the decision to close on that day \u201cis not a financially self-serving act\u201d but rather a \u201cclear statement about a set of values\u201d. The company has even said that it will not be processing any online orders that day. As a result, besides a handful of employees, most REI employees will have that Friday off. \u201cI\u2019m always proud to work for @REI, but today was especially great,\u201d tweeted Jordan LeBaron.

The clock is counting down to the time when most of the outdoor sports retailer\u2019s employees can go out and enjoy the day doing things like hiking, running and whatever else they like. </p> <p>The #optoutside campaign was announced on Monday, when Jerry Stritzke, president and CEO of Recreational Equipment Inc, emailed employees and co-op members to say that REI will close on Black Friday \u2013 the biggest shopping day of the year. </p> <p>\u201cOn November 27, we\u2019ll be closing all 143 of our stores and paying our employees to head outside,\u201d announced Stritzke, who runs the largest consumer co-op.

      "bodyText": "The government\u2019s drive to cut red tape and corporate tax has seen the UK move up the international league table for doing business in a year that has seen both rich and poor countries strive to ease regulations on setting up and running companies, the World Bank said. Britain rose from eighth to sixth place in the Washington-based organisation\u2019s rankings and was the highest placed of the G7 group of leading industrial nations. The bank said developing countries had quickened the pace of reforms but the highest positions in the list of 189 countries in its annual 2016 Doing Business report were again taken by high-income states. Singapore headed the top 10, followed by New Zealand, Denmark, South Korea, Hong Kong, Britain, the US, Sweden, Norway and Finland. Sajid Javid, Britain\u2019s business secretary, said: \u201cThe UK has once again climbed up the rankings and is one of the top places in the world to do business, getting closer to the government\u2019s target of reaching the top five. This is international recognition of the UK\u2019s strong and stable business environment, competitiveness and entrepreneurial spirit.\u201d The Department for Business Innovation and Skills said steps taken to make doing business easier had included a pledge to cut \u00a310bn of red tape, a promise to reduce corporation tax to 18%, an increase in the number and quality of apprentices, investment in research and the establishment of stronger trade ties with emerging markets. \u201cDespite being among the top performers, OECD high-income economies remain committed to further improving the regulatory environment for local small and medium-sized enterprises,\u201d said Augusto Lopez-Claros, director of the World Bank\u2019s global indicators group, which produces the report. \u201cIn the past year, entrepreneurs in many economies saw reforms that emphasised facilitating doing business via online platforms for every aspect of running a company, from initial registration to filing taxes.\u201d The World Bank study found that 60% of countries had announced measures designed to improve their business environment over the past year, while 85 developing countries had implemented 169 separate reforms, an increase from 154 in the previous year. The data shows the amount of time it takes to start a new business worldwide has been cut by more than half \u2013 from 51 to 20 days \u2013 since 2003. It said progress had been marked in sub-Saharan Africa, which accounted for 30% of the reforms and half the countries regarded as the biggest improvers. The length of time taken to start a business in Mozambique has fallen from 168 days to 19 in the past 12 years. Kaushik Basu, the World Bank\u2019s chief economist, said: \u201cA modern economy cannot function without regulation and, at the same time, it can be brought to a standstill through poor and cumbersome regulation. The challenge of development is to tread this narrow path by identifying regulations that are good and necessary, and shunning ones that thwart creativity and hamper the functioning of small and medium enterprises.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Britain\u2019s film and music industries have confirmed their status as two of the fastest growing sectors in the country, according to the latest GDP data. The film, video, TV and music publishing industries outpaced the wider economy between July and September, up 5.9% on the previous quarter, thanks to productions such as Star Wars spin-off Rogue One, which was shot at Pinewood Studios over the summer. Over the last five years, Britain\u2019s movie and music business has seen the value of its output increase by 60% to nearly \u00a33.2bn, compared with just under \u00a32bn in 2010. Other films that were shot in the UK in the last three months include Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them, Assassin\u2019s Creed and The Lost City of Z. Spectre, starring Daniel Craig as 007 for the fourth time, was partly filmed at Pinewood, home to 22 out of the 24 Bond films, and was in post production in July. The domestic movie industry has been helped by film tax relief, introduced in 2007 and extended to blockbuster TV and animation productions two years ago. Hollywood studios and US broadcasters have been using the UK as a giant film set, with HBO shooting epic fantasy drama Game of Thrones in Northern Ireland and Fox a series of 24 in London. With the government eager to boost Britain\u2019s creative industries further, George Osborne has steadily improved the tax relief regime for UK-based film productions, raising it to 25% of film costs in the March budget. About 66,000 people work in the UK film industry. According to the Office for National Statistics, the film and music industries bucked a wider trend as UK economic growth overall slowed to 0.5% in the third quarter, from 0.7% in the second. Britain\u2019s factories remain mired in recession \u2013 in particular steelmakers \u2013 and construction firms are also struggling.",

      "bodyText": "With continuing concerns about China after it seemed to abandon its 7% growth target at the weekend, and nervousness as the US Federal Reserve began its latest policy meeting, shares suffered a day of losses. In the UK, commodity companies, weakened by Chinese worries, put pressure on the market while the latest GDP figures missed economists\u2019 forecasts. There was also disappointing data from the US, including consumer confidence. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished down 51.75 points or 0.81% at 6365.27 Germany\u2019s Dax dropped 1.01% to 10,692.19 France\u2019s Cac closed down 1.02% at 4847.07 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB lost 1.15% to 22,369.92 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended down 1.49% at 10,322.4 In Greece, the Athens market added 1.3% to 727.38 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 51 points or 0.29%. On that note, we\u2019ll close up for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back again tomorrow. Oil prices continue to slide, with Brent crude now down nearly 2% at $46.62. Jasper Lawler at CMC Markets said: West Texas crude broke down to two-month lows as the US government signed off on a deal to sell some its strategic petroleum reserve from 2018 until 2025 ahead of an expected build in weekly API inventories data. There\u2019s an interesting summary of the current state of play with the Greek financial crisis, including a timeline, from Standard &amp; Poor\u2019s. It says: In recent months, Greece\u2019s fiscal position has significantly deteriorated, reflecting weaker economic activity, uncertainty regarding tax policy, as well as opportunistic delays on tax obligations. Under the new Financial Assistance Facility Agreement with the European Stability Mechanism, the government is currently putting into place tough measures to shore up revenues, and will move ahead with fresh expenditure cuts. We now forecast that the Greek economy will shrink by about 1% in 2015 and by an additional 2.3% next year, the latter partly reflecting an expected statistical effect (a large negative carryover from 2014). Risks to our GDP projections are substantial, however, and the margin of error is wide in both directions... Political and economic turmoil has severely weakened Greek banks\u2019 funding positions and has hampered their capacity to access the interbank market. According to our estimates, about \u20ac30 billion of foreign funding left the country between January and February 2015. At the same time, Greek depositors started to withdraw domestic funding--we estimate that from the end of November 2014 to the end of September 2015, Greek banks lost about \u20ac50 billion of domestic deposits, amounting to 28% of Greece\u2019s GDP. The full report is here: Greece, Its Banks, And The Debt Crisis: December 2014 To Now Back in the UK, and MPs will be quizzing representatives of the steel industry, including a director from Tata Steel which last week announced 1,200 job cuts, and the government on the crisis facing the sector. The select committee hearing can be seen live here from around 16.10. Timely, given iron and steel production was one of the fastest shrinking sectors of the UK economy, according to the latest GDP figures. Somewhat unusually, the poor US data has had a dampening effect on markets, said Connor Campbell at Spreadex: Normally such dismal data would have been a big boost to the Dow, due to their rate-hike delaying capabilities. However, since it was already beyond unlikely that the Fed would choose to pull the lift-off trigger this month anyway, today\u2019s economic bad news carried more weight as, well, bad news than it traditionally has done for much of the year. Not that this was too disastrous for the Dow (which, admittedly, was helped by decent third quarter results for Pfizer and Merck). Over in Greece, the country plans to release a framework for recapitalising its banks by Friday, according to Reuters. This would be a day after the European Central Bank releases results of its health check on the country\u2019s big four banks, and would allow parliament to vote it into law on Sunday. According to Reuters sources, Greece\u2019s bank rescue fund would plug any capital shortfall not covered by private investors, with a mix of new shares and contingent convertible bonds issued by the banks. Yet more disappointing data from the US. The US consumer confidence index has fallen from 102.6 in September to 97.6, well short of the forecast 103. Lynn Franco, director of economic indicators at the Conference Board, said: Consumer confidence declined in October, following September\u2019s modest gain. Consumers were less positive in their assessment of present-day conditions, in particular the job market, and were moderately less optimistic about the short-term outlook. Despite the decline, consumers still rate current conditions favorably, but they do not anticipate the economy strengthening much in the near-term. As the US Federal Reserve meets ahead of unveiling its latest policy decision tomorrow there is a host of weak data. This makes it even more unlikely the Fed will raise rates this month, although its statement will be scoured for any indications as to whether the bank plans to act before the end of the year. After the disappointing durable goods figures, Markit\u2019s services sector flash PMI reading came in at 54.4 in October. This was below the consensus forecast of 55.1 and compares with a final reading of 55.1 for September. So US markets have joined the general global downturn, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average 18 points lower in early trading. The decline has been limited by the growing expectation that the Fed will not move in December. Our economics editor Larry Elliott explains why the UK economy is becoming more unbalanced: Low interest rates make borrowing for consumption and speculation in financial assets cheap; the strong pound and the slowdown in the global economy make exporting UK made goods expensive and difficult. As things stand, poor quality growth is exacerbating the north-south divide and highlighting the age-old failure of Britain to pay its way in the world. Here\u2019s his analysis: This chart from RBC Capital Markets shows that UK growth has dropped below its recent average: New economic data from America just proved that Britain isn\u2019t the only country whose manufacturing industry is struggling. Orders for US durable goods (long-lasting, expensive items such as factory machinery) fell by 1.2% in September. That follows a 3% slump in August, suggesting that the world\u2019s largest economy is suffering from weaker demand in emerging markets. Orders for commercial aircraft shrank by 35%, while demand for primary metals such as steel dropped 2.9%, and orders for computers fell 4.5%. Associated Press has more details. We\u2019re collecting City reaction to today\u2019s GDP data here: Despite the manufacturing gloom, Britain is still excelling at making one thing - films. The UK film industry grew by a rip-roaring 6% in the last quarter, according to today\u2019s data from the ONS. Over the last 12 months, output has surged by 36%. The Daily Mail attributes this to successful films such as the latest James Bond adventures, which was partly filmed at Pinewood Studios. And here\u2019s another interesting, and depressing, chart from RBS: The weaker-than-expected growth figures haven\u2019t provided much cheer in the City. The FTSE 100 index of leading shares is down 20 points, or 0.3%, at 6396. Mining stocks such as Anglo American and BHP Billiton are among the biggest fallers, reflecting persistent worries over global growth. Should investors be cashing in? Ian Forrest, Investment Research Analyst at The Share Centre, argues against panicking: \u201cThe UK economy looks like it has been losing momentum, hindered by China\u2019s downturn, a construction slump and ailing manufacturers. However, recent figures including retail sales figures, have beat expectations. Therefore, despite the market\u2019s disappointment this morning, investors should acknowledge that this level of growth is still relatively good and the weakness appears to be mainly in manufacturing which is not unexpected.\u201d Here\u2019s another example of Britain\u2019s unbalanced recovery. While manufacturing shrank by 0.3% in the last quarter, the business services and finance sector grew by a healthy 1%. And \u201creal estate activities\u201d - the buying and selling of property - made the largest positive contribution to the increase. The UK economy is now almost entirely reliant on services for growth, says Kallum Pickering, UK economist at German bank Berenberg. Pickering is worried that both manufacturing and construction shrunk in the last quarter, and argues that structural reforms and fresh investment are needed to provide growth: In the construction industry, firms are experiencing increased costs pressures coming from labour and materials shortages. For production: It\u2019s biggest component, manufacturing, not only suffers from weakness in global trade, but, more precisely, a lack of investment and a lack of willingness of firms to base production in the UK. This stems from, among other things, a chronic uncertainty in the UK\u2019s future energy supplies due to lack of investment in energy capacity. Taken together, this implies that if a decline in UK services were to take place, the UK economy would be vulnerable. TUC general secretary Frances O\u2019Grady has rebuked George Osborne for failing to provide enough help to the manufacturing sector, and working people generally: \u201cWe need better balanced growth that delivers secure opportunities for working families. But while the economy is still expanding, the recovery is too weak, and Britain\u2019s manufacturing industry remains in decline. What\u2019s more, the government\u2019s failure to protect our steel industry looks set to mean the loss of even more manufacturing jobs. \u201cWe need a proper industrial strategy to ensure our manufacturing industry keeps up with the rest of the world. And the Chancellor must invest more to boost demand rather than cutting the public services and tax credits which are vital to supporting working families.\u201d This fascinating chart from Royal Bank of Scotland shows which areas of UK manufacturing performed particularly badly in the last three months. (this is taken from today\u2019s dataset, online here) Britain\u2019s manufacturing industry is stuck in recession, having contracted by 0.3% in the last three months and 0.5% in the second quarter of the year. Zach Witton, deputy chief economist at EEF, the manufacturers\u2019 organisation, says that the UK metals industry has been hammered particularly hard: \u201cGrowth was partly dragged back due to manufacturing remaining in recession. The weakness was broad based across the sector as recent challenges have been exacerbated by the sharp contraction in iron and steel and, signs of slower demand from the consumer sector. Britain\u2019s iron and steel-making industry suffered a torrid quarter, shrinking by 7%, according to Sky\u2019s Ed Conway: Thousands of jobs are already being cut in the industry, which faces oversupply and faltering demand in emerging markets. Alex Edwards, currency analyst at UKForex, explains why the pound fell once the UK growth figures were released: Although the services component of the data was positive, the result will go some way to supporting arguments for the Bank of England to leave interest rates on hold for longer. If the US Federal Reserve is also dovish in its statement tomorrow, it could raise the possibility that we won\u2019t see a UK rate hike until very late next year. Ben Brettell, senior economist at financial services firm Hargreaves Lansdown, is worried that the UK economy is becoming more unbalanced. The signs have been there for some time - the UK economy has been losing momentum..... Weaker construction and manufacturing output are the primary reasons for the slowdown, which could prompt concerns that the UK economy\u2019s reliance on the services sector is increasing further. Britain\u2019s March of the Makers has been shunted off course by the problems in developing markets, explains Jeremy Cook of foreign exchange firm World First. Instead, we have a \u201cStroll of the Shoppers\u201d, he says: \u201cManufacturing has been damaged in the UK by a strong pound and weakness in crucial export markets as a result of fears of a hard landing in China.\u201d The good news is that Britain\u2019s economy has now expanded for 11 quarters in a row. And unless Germany posts a stellar quarter, the UK is still the third-best performing major economy since 2008. Britain\u2019s service sector is now more than 10% bigger than in 2008, before the collapse of Lehman Brothers. But as this chart from the ONS shows, the other sectors are still lagging. The ONS explains: The construction and production industries were more acutely affected by the deterioration in economic conditions. Following the downturn, the services industries generally grew steadily, albeit slowly, with output exceeding its pre-downturn peak in Quarter 1 (Jan to Mar) 2012. Production and construction activity began to grow in 2010 - with manufacturing showing particular strength \u2013 but neither industry sustained this growth. The pound has fallen around 0.15% against the US dollar, to $1.5324. Traders are concluding that weaker growth means British interest rates will remain at their current record low for some time yet. The chancellor has tweeted about the GDP report: We don\u2019t actually know how other major economies performed in the last quarter* (we get the US GDP on Thursday, and eurozone data next month). And that reference to \u2018tough decisions\u2019 is a nod to the tax credits debacle. * - apart from China, which reported annual growth of 6.9% last week Britain\u2019s service sector provided most of the growth in the last quarter: This is not good news for George Osborne, Britain\u2019s finance minister. Not only has growth slowed, but there\u2019s no sign of his famous March of the Makers. The economy looks as unbalanced as ever, given the contraction in manufacturing. More bad news -- Britain\u2019s manufacturing sector contracted by 0.3% during the last quarter. Britain\u2019s service sector was the fastest growing part of the UK economy in the last quarter, while the building sector suffered a sharp, and worrying, contraction. Here\u2019s the detail: Services increased by 0.7%, Production increased by 0.3%, Agriculture increased by 0.5%. Construction output decreased by 2.2%. Breaking! The UK economy grew by just 0.5% in the third quarter of 2015, down from 0.7% three months earlier. The Office for National Statistics is releasing full details right now..... This is your one minute warning.... Make that three economists... Yes - two economists quoted in this blog already :) Tension is building in the City, as investors wait to see whether Britain\u2019s growth slowed in the last three months.... It\u2019s worth remembering that the current recovery has been the slowest from any recession in the last 100 years. This is particularly stark if you look at GDP per head, as the TUC did in August: But Britain has also grown faster than many rivals over the last five years, with Europe hit by the eurozone crisis and Japan weighed down by its huge national debt and persistent deflation. Today\u2019s growth figures may raise the spectre that Britain\u2019s economy becomes increasingly unbalanced next year. Jeremy Cook of foreign exchange firm World First explains how service sector companies have outpaced their rivals recently: Industrial numbers have remained weak through Q3 but consumption has remained strong, although we did see a temporary blip midway through the quarter. Exports are said to be more difficult given the strength of the pound and the weakness in crucial export markets. As we get ready for Halloween, we think that today\u2019s number is unlikely to send market observers scurrying behind the sofa but may give new voice to concerns around the imbalances in growth moving into 2016. Robert Wood, chief UK economist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch, also predicts that growth slowed to 0.5% in the last three months. He just told Bloomberg TV that he expects today\u2019s GDP figure to be weaker than three month ago because UK manufacturing was weak last quarter. And that\u2019s because the global economy was weaker. Wood believes that \u201cstrong domestic demand\u201d will continue to drive UK growth, with real wages now rising at around 3%. My colleague Katie Allen has rounded up the key charts that show the state of the UK economy, setting the scene for today\u2019s growth figures. It includes this one, showing how the construction sector has struggled in recent months: Katie explains: Like manufacturing, the construction sector \u2013 which accounts for about 6% of the economy \u2013 is unlikely to have contributed to overall economic growth in the third quarter. Construction experienced sharp drops in output in July and August and it seems unlikely that September saw enough of a rebound to make up for that slow summer. More here: Mikael Olai Milh\u00f8j of Denmark\u2019s Danske Bank, reckons that UK growth slowed to 0.5% in the last quarter, down from 0.7% in Q2. He points out that construction and manufacturing surveys over the summer were disappointing. He predicts that construction will have knocked 0.1% off today\u2019s growth number, while manufacturing will have been flat. That leaves us depending on the service sector once again..... Reuters polled 59 City economists about today\u2019s GDP figures. Estimates ranged from growth of just +0.3% up to +0.8%, leading to an average prediction of +0.6%. The City hasn\u2019t done too badly at guessing GDP recently - although it had a shocker a few years ago when the economy unexpectedly shrank by 0.5% in Q4 2010.... Good morning. We\u2019re kicking off a busy few days for the global economy with live coverage of the latest UK growth figures. Today\u2019s GDP figures, released on the dot of 9.30am GMT, will provide the first official snapshot of how the economy performed between July and September. Economists predict that growth slowed, to a quarterly rate of around 0.6% from 0.7% in the second quarter. That\u2019s due to chillier winds from the global economy, with UK exporters suffering from weaker demand from overseas. But there have also been signs that the UK domestic economy has lost some momentum this summer, particularly in the construction sector. A weak GDP reading would fuel concerns that the recovery is faltering; another headache for chancellor George Osborne, a day after the House of Lords voted to delay his controversial tax credit cuts. But stronger growth would raise the chances that the Bank of England raises interest rates sooner rather than later. Three months ago, the UK economy finally exceeded its pre-crisis level on a per-capita basis (ie, economic power adjusted for population changes), nearly seven year after the financial crisis struck. But Britain\u2019s dominant service sector is the only part of the economy that\u2019s actually bigger than in 2008 - construction, manufacturing, and the wider production sectors are still playing catch-up: Britain is Europe\u2019s second largest economy, so today\u2019s growth figures have international significance at a crucial time for the world economy. Last week, China reported that its growth had slowed, raising fears over the global economic outlook. That will occupy the attention of the US Federal Reserve, America\u2019s central bank, which begins a two-day policy meeting today. They\u2019re likely to leave borrowing costs at their record lows yet again. On Thursday, we find out how the US economy performed in the third quarter. Economists predict that quarterly growth slowed to below 0.4%, from above 0.5%. And on Friday, the Japanese central bank will issue new economic projections. With Japan\u2019s economy faltering too, it could soon be forced into fresh stimulus measures....",

It says:</p> <blockquote> <p>In recent months, Greece\u2019s fiscal position has significantly deteriorated, reflecting weaker economic activity, uncertainty regarding tax policy, as well as opportunistic delays on tax obligations. Under the new Financial Assistance Facility Agreement with the European Stability Mechanism, the government is currently putting into place tough measures to shore up revenues, and will move ahead with fresh expenditure cuts. We now forecast that the Greek economy will shrink by about 1% in 2015 and by an additional 2.3% next year, the latter partly reflecting an expected statistical effect (a large negative carryover from 2014). Risks to our GDP projections are substantial, however, and the margin of error is wide in both directions...</p> <p>Political and economic turmoil has severely weakened Greek banks\u2019 funding positions and has hampered their capacity to access the interbank market. According to our estimates, about \u20ac30 billion of foreign funding left the country between January and February 2015. At the same time, Greek depositors started to withdraw domestic funding--we estimate that from the end of November 2014 to the end of September 2015, Greek banks lost about \u20ac50 billion of domestic deposits, amounting to 28% of Greece\u2019s GDP.</p> </blockquote> <p>The full report is here:</p> <h2><a href=\"https://www.globalcreditportal.com/ratingsdirect/renderArticle.do?articleId=1470250&amp;SctArtId=349608&amp;from=CM&amp;nsl_code=LIME&amp;sourceObjectId=9364668&amp;sourceRevId=1&amp;fee_ind=N&amp;exp_date=20251025-20:30:46\">Greece, Its Banks, And The Debt Crisis: December 2014 To Now</a></h2> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-562f97ece4b053752a0a3caa\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2015-10-27T15:58:44.070Z\">3.58pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Back in the UK, and MPs will be quizzing representatives of the steel industry, including a director from Tata Steel which last week announced 1,200 job cuts, and the government on the crisis facing the sector.

      "bodyText": "\u201cDANGER,\u201d says the sign on the 6ft metal fence that surrounds Redcar\u2019s blast furnace. \u201cPotential risk of flying debris from drop-balling operations. Our aim is zero harm.\u201d On this still, grey morning, I feel under no threat as I peer through the slats of the fence at the deserted site because the furnace is no more; steelmaking in Redcar is defunct. A pheasant scuttles across the road and squeezes through the fence. Zero physical harm has been achieved. It is just the financial and psychological harm that Redcar has to worry about now. I\u2019m at the site with Joan Heggie, a research fellow at Teesside University and an expert on the region\u2019s steel industry. She is furious at what she sees as the government\u2019s shortsightedness in allowing the furnace to be shut down. \u201cIt\u2019s just been turned off; it\u2019s killed it. You can\u2019t start coke ovens up again; you have to rebuild them. Once they\u2019ve gone cold, they crack and disintegrate.\u201d The pheasants from the adjoining marshlands can have the run of the place. The Redcar plant\u2019s history over the past 40 years has been tangled. British Steel merged with a Dutch company to form Corus, which was then taken over by the Indian giant Tata. The latter mothballed the plant in 2010 before selling it to the Thai conglomerate SSI, which, faced with falling steel prices, has now liquidated the plant. \u201cIt\u2019s such a waste of money,\u201d says Heggie. \u201cIt cost the Thai company the best part of half a billion to get it working. They put a huge amount of money in, and that technology is now wasted. If this site never makes steel again, which is looking increasingly likely, then all this has to be properly dismantled in accordance with environmental regulations.\u201d She reckons the final cleanup bill could be \u00a31bn \u2013 payable by the taxpayer as the company that owned the site has gone into liquidation. Paul Warren, the multi-union chairman at the Redcar plant, has been dealing with the human fallout: he tells me 2,200 SSI employees have lost their jobs, plus a similar number of contractors, and who knows how many shopowners and tradespeople in Redcar and the surrounding area will be affected? \u201cGhost town\u201d is the phrase on most local people\u2019s lips. Redcar\u2019s charity shop-filled high street is already depressed; now even the charity shops are going to struggle. Warren, 43, had been at the steelworks for 26 years \u2013 all his working life. Despite the changes in ownership, it was a good, stable, well-paid job. Steelworkers were earning between \u00a330,000 and \u00a340,000 a year. \u201cI\u2019ve got a sour taste in my mouth now it\u2019s finished, and you can imagine how the managers and the workforce who have been here 30, 40, 45 years feel. But it has given me a good living.\u201d He says the annual wage bill was \u00a370m \u2013 \u201c\u00a370m that will now come out of the local economy\u201d. He and his colleagues might get other jobs \u2013 Teesside is by no means yet an industrial wasteland and retains a strong chemical industry \u2013 but they are unlikely to pay the same wages. Steelworkers\u2019 skills, built up over a long period in challenging conditions, are not easily transferable. \u201cA production operator who was on \u00a331,000 is looking at a job doing general factory work at somewhere between \u00a317,000 and \u00a322,000.\u201d He will also have lost the camaraderie he enjoyed at the steelworks, and the pride he took in doing a demanding job to which he had devoted his life. Driving a forklift truck, working on a production line or stacking supermarket shelves on a zero-hours contract doesn\u2019t compare. Tom Blenkinsop, the Labour MP for Middlesbrough South and East Cleveland, tells me that, privately, ministers have admitted turning off the furnace was a mistake. The lack of any sort of industrial strategy on the part of the government can rarely have been so apparent. \u201cThe steelworks was the heart of the local economy,\u201d he says, \u201cand more than that, it is the identity, the dignity and the esteem that derived from working there. For young men, it was a source of pride as well as way above-average wages. People in other areas don\u2019t understand what those wages mean around here.\u201d One evening, I join a procession up into the hills above the village of Eston where, in the mid-19th century, the ore that was the foundation of the area\u2019s iron and steel industry was discovered. I walk up the slippery path with Anna Turley, who overturned a Lib Dem majority to regain Redcar for Labour in the 2015 election. She admits that the sudden announcement of the closure had been a \u201cbaptism of fire\u201d, and says the town is still in shock. \u201cIt\u2019s like a grieving process. There is anger, frustration, confusion. Some people are getting back up and dusting themselves down, but the training money hasn\u2019t really come through and people are confused about what they can access, what courses they can get on \u2013 and while training is all well and good, you need jobs at the end of the day. This isn\u2019t an area like Manchester or London where you can just absorb a shock like that.\u201d The procession \u2013 more a theatrical happening than a demonstration \u2013 is marshalled by film-maker Craig Hornby, whose 2004 documentary A Century in Stone traced the history of Teesside\u2019s industrial boom. Up on Eston Nab \u2013 the very top of the hill \u2013 the 200 or so marchers switch their torches on and off in unison, a cornet player from a local brass band sounds the Last Post and Hornby proclaims that we should never forget the sacrifices of the miners and steelworkers who created the communities on Teesside. \u201cWe are here to pay our respects to a great industry that has passed,\u201d Hornby declares through a megaphone. But Blenkinsop, who is on the march, would disagree. He tells me heavy industry has to remain at the heart of life on Teesside, which was founded on iron and steelmaking, shipbuilding and the chemical industry. He believes steelmaking could return and sees the cheap energy that fracking could provide as crucial to the area\u2019s regeneration. I ask Jeff Garbutt, one of the steelworkers on the march, what it will achieve, given that the works has been closed, the furnace outed, the battle lost. \u201cThis is just to show we\u2019re still here and still fighting,\u201d he says. \u201cThis community sticks together, and we want to show the government we haven\u2019t gone away.\u201d Steel closures are nothing new, of course. Britain has been deindustrialising since the early 1980s. Thirty-five years ago, the town of Consett \u2013 40 miles to the north-west of Redcar \u2013 suffered an even greater industrial catastrophe. Consett, which has a population of 30,000, was a one-employer town. The steelworks employed 4,300 people directly, and probably three or four times that number indirectly. When it closed, the town suddenly had no work. \u201cA shockwave went through the whole community,\u201d says the local Labour MP Pat Glass, who had just started work in education when the steelworks closed in September 1980. \u201cPeople were numb, and we had a short period when male unemployment was almost 100%.\u201d Glass says the 1980s were virtually a write-off, and that Consett only began to revive in the mid-1990s with light engineering and food companies. But she admits that the recovery has been limited. \u201cOn the surface, the job figures look very good, but the reality is there are lots of part-time jobs, lots of zero-hours contracts and lots of minimum-wage jobs. One of the most worrying trends I\u2019ve seen recently is the number of young people \u2013 particularly young men \u2013 who are dropping out of the system altogether. They are tired of being sanctioned and tired of coming on and off zero-hours jobs, so they\u2019re just working in the black economy, and that makes them incredibly vulnerable to exploitation.\u201d Mick Curran, a bricklayer at the steelworks in the 1970s, has compiled an archive of photographs of the plant that once towered over Consett and coated it in red iron-oxide dust. Why is he so determined to keep its memory alive? \u201cI\u2019ve got four sons,\u201d he says. \u201cThey don\u2019t remember it. They hear you talking about it, and now you can show them photos. My father worked there, my grandfather worked there, and I want my sons to remember how it was.\u201d Curran was in his mid-40s when the steelworks closed. He and a colleague set up their own bricklaying company in the early 1980s, but he sustained an injury and hasn\u2019t worked since \u2013 a familiar story in the town. A generation was beached by the closure, and the upturn in the mid-90s came too late for them. Curran says many of the men laid off thought their redundancy money would last for ever, and spent lavishly. \u201cThey were putting \u00a310 on horses and if they got a win, everybody in Consett knew, but nobody knew how much they\u2019d spent.\u201d Most either ended up on the dole or left the area to try their luck elsewhere. Alex Watson, the leader of the local council from 1990 to 2009, claims much of the credit for what recovery there was. He worked at the steelworks in the 1970s and became a councillor the year before the plant closed. \u201cWe were totally dependent on the works,\u201d he says, \u201cand the closure was devastating. We were crucified. They weren\u2019t happy with just closing the steelworks. In 1984, they ripped up our rail link too. The government gave us \u00a39.6m to reclaim the works, but it was only a very small part of what we needed, so we had 10 years of depression. Hownsgill Viaduct became a landmark for suicides.\u201d When he became council leader, Watson says he sought to cut through the red tape affecting planning decisions. \u201cPlanners have this culture of blocking anything that is going to create jobs, so we went against their recommendations. We invested in small businesses, and said never again would we be dependent on one single industry.\u201d A group of local men launched Phileas Fogg snacks, which enjoyed 20 years of success and created 200 jobs in the town (though that factory, too, closed this year). Consett also attracted aerospace, light engineering and food companies, sought to be at the forefront of IT development in the north-east and set up a long-term initiative called the Genesis Project with property developers Jack and Caroline Fawcett to build housing and shops on the 283-hectare (700-acre) wasteland left by the steelworks. Genesis continues to operates and, 35 years on, large tracts of land are still being covered by neat new housing estates. Whether Consett has really recovered, though, depends on who you talk to. There are two Consetts: the high street remains rundown and forlorn, but up at the new retail park there is a bustling Tesco and a swish, state-of-the-art Starbucks. At the Whistle Blower pub in the town centre, where lagers are being downed at 10am ahead of the Sunderland-Newcastle derby match, a latte costs me 99p. In Starbucks, it is three times that, though in fairness the man serving is wearing a headset and suggests I try the smoother Guatemalan blend. None of the customers is clad in Newcastle kit. I walk around the town on Sunday morning, and stumble across a stone slab memorialising the works \u2013 Consett has no museum dedicated to its 140-year iron- and steelmaking history, but is not short of ad hoc reminders of its past. The memorial, which looks like a neolithic standing stone and may soon feel as if it comes from an equally distant age, is at the top of a flight of steps. I descend and come across two middle-aged men sitting on a bench alongside their two beautifully manicured dogs \u2013 a malumute and a Japanase akita. One of the men, David Holland, has no time for Watson\u2019s talk of successful regeneration. \u201cI\u2019ve just finished working on one industrial estate,\u201d he says. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing up here, no work whatsoever. There was a little bit of a recovery in the 90s, but since the recession kicked in there\u2019s been nothing.\u201d He says the relatively cheap housing in Consett has attracted lots of people who commute to Newcastle and Durham, but that there are few jobs for locals who don\u2019t have the education, money and mobility of the newcomers. Consett remains a town where many have been left behind. I walk on and meet Ray and Julie Brown, who are watching their granddaughter play in a little park close to another memorial to the vanished world. Ray tells me he was the last apprentice to be trained at Consett, following his father into the works and finishing his four-year apprenticeship as a welder just weeks before it closed. He is one of the lucky ones. He found a job making excavators for the Japanese multinational Komatsu at a factory in Chester-le-Street and has been there ever since; Julie works as an administrator in the NHS. Ray says how much cleaner the town is now \u2013 \u201cHe used to sweat red dust,\u201d says Julie \u2013 and spreads his arms to show the quiet beauty of the surrounding countryside. But employment remains a problem. \u201cJobs came, but they were never plentiful,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019ve got a 21-year-old lad, and all he can get is 16 hours a week up at Tesco.\u201d He trained as a chef, but Consett is not noted for its fine dining and he doesn\u2019t drive, putting Newcastle and Durham out of reach. Can\u2019t he learn to drive, I suggest. \u201cIt costs a fortune and he doesn\u2019t have the money,\u201d says Julie. \u201cIt\u2019s a vicious circle. We do worry about what the future holds for him. Health-wise, Consett looks and smells and is better, but in terms of jobs, there is a hell of a long way still to go. It\u2019s getting there, but it lacks the big employer.\u201d \u201cThere are jobs, but you\u2019ll never bring back the British Steel jobs,\u201d says Billy Robson, an ex-steelworker who now runs the YMCA in Consett. \u201cYou were destined to work hard and get a good wage all your life. They were really good days for the town and I loved the job. We\u2019ve resurrected Consett, but it will never be the same. It will never return to its finest glory. We had a 35-year reunion three weeks ago, and the craic remembering some of the horseplay we used to get up to was fantastic. People were shedding tears.\u201d We shouldn\u2019t live in a romanticised past, and Craig Hornby rightly reminds me that people are individuals \u201cwith their own interests, quirks and motivations\u201d first, and members of a tribe defined by what they do second. Yet something powerful disappeared with the end of steelmaking in Consett, and Redcar will now have to come to terms with the identity crisis created by the loss of so potent a symbol. Ashes to ashes, red dust to dust. \u2022 This article was amended on October 28 2015. An earlier version said British Steel sold the Redcar plant to Corus, then to Tata. In fact British Steel merged with a Dutch company to form Corus, which was later taken over by Tata.",

Our aim is zero harm.\u201d On this still, grey morning, I feel under no threat as I peer through the slats of the fence at the deserted site because the furnace is no more; steelmaking in Redcar is defunct. A pheasant scuttles across the road and squeezes through the fence. Zero physical harm has been achieved. It is just the financial and psychological harm that Redcar has to worry about now.</p> <p>I\u2019m at the site with <a href=\"http://www.tees.ac.uk/sections/research/social_futures/staff_profile_details.cfm?staffprofileid=U0019405\">Joan Heggie</a>, a research fellow at Teesside University and an expert on the region\u2019s steel industry. She is furious at what she sees as the government\u2019s shortsightedness in allowing the furnace to be shut down. \u201cIt\u2019s just been turned off; it\u2019s killed it. You can\u2019t start coke ovens up again; you have to rebuild them. Once they\u2019ve gone cold, they crack and disintegrate.\u201d The pheasants from the adjoining marshlands can have the run of the place.</p> <p>The Redcar plant\u2019s history over the past 40 years has been tangled. British Steel merged with a Dutch company to form Corus, which was then taken over by the Indian giant Tata. The latter mothballed the plant in 2010 before selling it to the Thai conglomerate SSI, which, faced with falling steel prices, has now liquidated the plant. \u201cIt\u2019s such a waste of money,\u201d says Heggie. \u201cIt cost the Thai company the best part of half a billion to get it working. They put a huge amount of money in, and that technology is now wasted. If this site never makes steel again, which is looking increasingly likely, then all this has to be properly dismantled in accordance with environmental regulations.\u201d She reckons the final cleanup bill could be \u00a31bn \u2013 payable by the taxpayer as the company that owned the site has gone into liquidation.</p> <p>Paul Warren, the multi-union chairman at the Redcar plant, has been dealing with the human fallout: he tells me 2,200 SSI employees have lost their jobs, plus a similar number of contractors, and who knows how many shopowners and tradespeople in Redcar and the surrounding area will be affected? \u201cGhost town\u201d is the phrase on most local people\u2019s lips. Redcar\u2019s charity shop-filled high street is already depressed; now even the charity shops are going to struggle.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0ba060da795cabf8cd484d0b849d1f0bc23fbb0a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0ba060da795cabf8cd484d0b849d1f0bc23fbb0a/0_158_3498_2098/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The steelworks in 2009\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The steelworks in 2009.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Nigel Roddis/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Warren, 43, had been at the steelworks for 26 years \u2013 all his working life. Despite the changes in ownership, it was a good, stable, well-paid job. Steelworkers were earning between \u00a330,000 and \u00a340,000 a year. \u201cI\u2019ve got a sour taste in my mouth now it\u2019s finished, and you can imagine how the managers and the workforce who have been here 30, 40, 45 years feel. But it has given me a good living.\u201d He says the annual wage bill was \u00a370m \u2013 \u201c\u00a370m that will now come out of the local economy\u201d.</p> <p>He and his colleagues might get other jobs \u2013 Teesside is by no means yet an industrial wasteland and retains a strong chemical industry \u2013 but they are unlikely to pay the same wages. Steelworkers\u2019 skills, built up over a long period in challenging conditions, are not easily transferable. \u201cA production operator who was on \u00a331,000 is looking at a job doing general factory work at somewhere between \u00a317,000 and \u00a322,000.\u201d He will also have lost the camaraderie he enjoyed at the steelworks, and the pride he took in doing a demanding job to which he had devoted his life. Driving a forklift truck, working on a production line or stacking supermarket shelves on a zero-hours contract doesn\u2019t compare.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/oct/03/redcar-looks-to-rise-from-ashes-after-steelworks-blow\">Redcar looks to rise from the ashes after steelworks blow</a> </p> </aside>  <p><a href=\"http://tomblenkinsop.com/\">Tom Blenkinsop</a>, the Labour MP for Middlesbrough South and East Cleveland, tells me that, privately, ministers have admitted turning off the furnace was a mistake.

The memorial, which looks like a neolithic standing stone and may soon feel as if it comes from an equally distant age, is at the top of a flight of steps. I descend and come across two middle-aged men sitting on a bench alongside their two beautifully manicured dogs \u2013 a malumute and a Japanase akita.</p> <p>One of the men, David Holland, has no time for Watson\u2019s talk of successful regeneration. \u201cI\u2019ve just finished working on one industrial estate,\u201d he says. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing up here, no work whatsoever. There was a little bit of a recovery in the 90s, but since the recession kicked in there\u2019s been nothing.\u201d He says the relatively cheap housing in Consett has attracted lots of people who commute to Newcastle and Durham, but that there are few jobs for locals who don\u2019t have the education, money and mobility of the newcomers. Consett remains a town where many have been left behind.</p> <p>I walk on and meet Ray and Julie Brown, who are watching their granddaughter play in a little park close to another memorial to the vanished world. Ray tells me he was the last apprentice to be trained at Consett, following his father into the works and finishing his four-year apprenticeship as a welder just weeks before it closed. He is one of the lucky ones. He found a job making excavators for the Japanese multinational <a href=\"http://www.komatsu.com/\">Komatsu</a> at a factory in Chester-le-Street and has been there ever since; Julie works as an administrator in the NHS. Ray says how much cleaner the town is now \u2013 \u201cHe used to sweat red dust,\u201d says Julie \u2013 and spreads his arms to show the quiet beauty of the surrounding countryside. But employment remains a problem.</p> <p>\u201cJobs came, but they were never plentiful,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019ve got a 21-year-old lad, and all he can get is 16 hours a week up at Tesco.\u201d He trained as a chef, but Consett is not noted for its fine dining and he doesn\u2019t drive, putting Newcastle and Durham out of reach. Can\u2019t he learn to drive, I suggest. \u201cIt costs a fortune and he doesn\u2019t have the money,\u201d says Julie. \u201cIt\u2019s a vicious circle. We do worry about what the future holds for him. Health-wise, Consett looks and smells and is better, but in terms of jobs, there is a hell of a long way still to go. It\u2019s getting there, but it lacks the big employer.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"dddca24a2c641534e54de0ac2a73a2ba34285f59\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/dddca24a2c641534e54de0ac2a73a2ba34285f59/0_258_3900_2340/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ex-steelworker Billy Robson next to machinery from the Consett plant\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ex-steelworker Billy Robson next to machinery from the Consett plant.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Gary Calton/Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cThere are jobs, but you\u2019ll never bring back the British Steel jobs,\u201d says Billy Robson, an ex-steelworker who now runs the YMCA in Consett. \u201cYou were destined to work hard and get a good wage all your life. They were really good days for the town and I loved the job. We\u2019ve resurrected Consett, but it will never be the same. It will never return to its finest glory. We had a 35-year reunion three weeks ago, and the craic remembering some of the horseplay we used to get up to was fantastic. People were shedding tears.\u201d</p> <p>We shouldn\u2019t live in a romanticised past, and Craig Hornby rightly reminds me that people are individuals \u201cwith their own interests, quirks and motivations\u201d first, and members of a tribe defined by what they do second. Yet something powerful disappeared with the end of steelmaking in Consett, and Redcar will now have to come to terms with the identity crisis created by the loss of so potent a symbol. Ashes to ashes, red dust to dust.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on October 28 2015. An earlier version said British Steel sold the Redcar plant to Corus, then to Tata. In fact British Steel merged with a Dutch company to form Corus, which was later taken over by Tata.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Thousands of Morrisons staff are preparing to sue the supermarket after their personal details were leaked online. A senior employee, Andrew Skelton, was jailed for eight years in July after he posted details of nearly 100,000 staff online. Information including salaries, national insurance numbers, dates of birth and bank account details were also sent to a number of newspapers. The data breach at Morrisons\u2019 Bradford head office last year cost the company more than \u00a32m to rectify. More than 2,000 current and former staff are pursuing a group claim alleging that the retailer was ultimately responsible for breaches of privacy, confidence and data protection law. More staff are expected to join the claim, after lawyers were given a four-month period to sign them up. Potential claimants include people who worked at Morrisons, its subsidiary Farmers Boy or former business Kiddicare before November 2014. Nick McAleenan, a data privacy lawyer at JMW Solicitors, said: \u201cWhenever employers are given personal details of their staff, they have a duty to look after them. \u201cThat is especially important given that most companies now gather and manage such material digitally and, as a result, it can be accessed and distributed relatively easily if the information is not protected.\u201d He said Morrisons workers affected by the data breach were worried about the possibility of money being taken from their bank accounts and potential negative consequences for their credit rating. Skelton, who worked as a senior internal auditor at the Bradford head office, leaked the data after being disciplined over using the company\u2019s postroom to conduct eBay deals. The leak was highly embarrassing for Morrisons, coming just weeks after the group\u2019s treasurer and head of tax, Paul Coyle, was arrested over insider dealing relating to trading in the shares of Ocado, Morrisons\u2019 partner for its new online grocery delivery service. Coyle was found guilty of insider dealing and jailed for a year in March. A spokesman for Morrisons said: \u201cWe are contesting this case. We are not accepting liability for the actions of a rogue individual. We can confirm that we are not aware that anybody suffered any financial loss from this breach.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The UK economic recovery has lost momentum, with growth slowing to 0.5% in the past three months, from 0.7% in the previous quarter. Here is what economists made of the official figures. David Kern, chief economist at the British Chambers of Commerce The main reason for the slowdown was the sharp fall in construction, a sector which is traditionally volatile and erratic. However, our strong services sector continues to keep the recovery on track. Our economic growth remains unbalanced ... The trade deficit also widened in this quarter, and we are still heavily reliant on consumer spending. Nevertheless, it is good news that real GDP is now 6.4% higher than the pre-recession peak in early 2008. What we need now is further measures to boost growth to support the recovery, with particular emphasis on exports and infrastructure investments. Fixing the fundamentals will place the economy on a surer footing.\u201d Rob Harbron, managing economist at the Centre for Economics and Business Research Today\u2019s findings don\u2019t give huge cause for celebration, but neither are they too gloomy. The economic recovery may be built on relatively fragile foundations, including the imbalance between different sectors, but growth is still ticking along for now. Certainly employment levels and household spending power are improving domestically. The key threat on the horizon comes from a cooling global economy alongside a less-supportive inflationary environment next year. Cebr still expects the UK economy to expand comfortably above the 2% mark this year, but this will be followed by a gradual slowdown over the next few years.\u201d Vicky Redwood, chief UK economist at Capital Economics The preliminary estimate of GDP confirmed that the economic recovery cooled in the third quarter. We think that this will be only temporary. Nonetheless, the news clearly further reduces the chances of an interest rate rise in the near future.\u201d James Knightley, UK economist at ING We expect a better growth number in the fourth quarter. The economy is creating jobs again in significant numbers, wages are rising nearly 3% in real terms and consumer confidence is at high levels. This suggests that the domestic growth story looks good. Inflation is also set to start rising as the falls in commodity prices seen late last year drop out of the annual comparison and rising domestic costs (most obviously wage costs) are increasingly passed on to the end consumer. Consequently, we continue to look for a rate rise in the second quarter of 2016 \u2013 after the Federal Reserve, but well ahead of market expectations of late 2016/early 2017.\u201d Chris Hare, economist at Investec A slowdown in growth does not necessarily mean that rate hikes should be deferred. But either way, today\u2019s GDP surprise is small so will not have first order implications for the upcoming inflation report forecast, due for publication next Thursday. The really key issue for the MPC to address next week is whether/how to push back against market rate expectations, which are not pricing in the first Bank rate hike until Q1 2017. Our call remains that the MPC will begin to tighten policy in Q1 2016!\u201d Alan Clarke, head of European fixed-income strategy at Scotiabank It was not a weak report, but obviously undershooting the Bank of England\u2019s 0.6% assumption. To put it in context a 0.5% q/q reading in the US (later in the week) would be an upward surprise, so the UK economy is still posting a respectable pace of growth. Given the tendency for the construction data to be revised, I wouldn\u2019t be surprised to see this headline figure nudged higher, but that is next month\u2019s business.\u201d Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit The cause for concern here is that the business surveys indicate that the slowdown is spreading from the struggling manufacturing sector to the far larger services economy, meaning growth looks set to slow further in the fourth quarter. There are signs that companies are becoming more risk averse as global growth worries intensify, pulling back on their hiring, investment and spending intentions, which could lead to the slowdown becoming deeper and more entrenched. The economy therefore looks to be on course to grow by 2.3% in 2015, down from 2.9% in 2014 and below its long term trend rate.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Shire shares are soaring after positive trial results for lifitegrast, its treatment for dry eye disease. The treatment met its primary and secondary targets, and Shire now plans to re-submit an application to the US Food and Drug Administration in the first quarter of 2016. Earlier this month the FDA had said it would not approve lifitegrast based on current data and Shire was banking on a positive result from these Phase 3 trials to make a new application. The company said it believed the new data would satisfy the FDA\u2019s request for an additional clinical study. Chief executive Flemming Ornskov, said: If approved by the FDA, this keeps us on track fro a potential US launch next year. We are also planning to use these data, in conjunction with the existing comprehensive clinical data set, for regulatory filings for lifitegrast in other markets outside the US. We entered the ophthalmics space because we saw tremendous opportunity to address unmet needs in eye care...We\u2019re increasingly confident about the potential of lifitegrast and the overall progress we\u2019re making in growth Shire\u2019s presence in ophthalmics. The news has lifted Shire\u2019s shares by 301p or 6.5% to \u00a349.10, making it the biggest riser in a falling FTSE 100.

The chancellor is in a fine old mess over tax credits; now the latest evidence is that the economy is coming off the boil as well.

Growth has slowed from 0.7% to 0.5%, but the economy is a long way from falling back into recession. What\u2019s more, it is possible that the first stab at calculating output in the three months to September will be revised up by the Office for National Statistics when more data arrives.

The first is that the economy has lapsed back into a familiar pattern of having a strong service sector and weak manufacturing.

    "webTitle": "GDP growth in the UK slows more than expected to 0.5%", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The already remote prospects of an interest rate rise from the Bank of England this year have all but disappeared after a recession in manufacturing and the biggest slump in construction output in three years slowed the UK economy by more than expected in the third quarter of 2015. City analysts said news that the economy\u2019s rate of expansion eased to 0.5%, from 0.7% in the previous quarter, had ruled out an increase in the cost of borrowing until the spring or summer of next year. The first stab at estimating gross domestic product from the Office for National Statistics highlighted Britain\u2019s two-speed economy, with growth entirely due to increased activity in the dominant service sector. Construction output fell by more than 2% while industry contracted for a third successive quarter. The data represents a blow to George Osborne\u2019s much-trumpeted \u201cMarch of the makers\u201d and suggests any increase in interest rates, from their record low of 0.5%, are unlikely until 2016. However, the GDP increase in the three months from July to September marked the 11th consecutive quarter of growth even if it represented a decline on the previous quarter. Most economists had been forecasting growth of 0.6%. Chris Williamson, chief economist at economic pollsters Markit, said: \u201cThe third quarter slowdown, and warning lights from recent business surveys about the weakness intensifying in September, suggests that policymakers will want more time to assess the extent of the slowdown as we move into the fourth quarter, effectively postponing any rate hikes until next year.\u201d Sterling was left unmoved by the news. Richard de Meo, managing director at foreign exchange firm Foenix Partners, said the dip in growth was \u201cnot enough to disrupt market expectations for interest rate hikes in mid-2016\u201d. The economy is still largely reliant on the services sector, which gave its best performance in nearly a year with growth of 0.7%. This was driven by a pick-up in the business services and finance sector, which posted an increase of 1%. This contrasts with the continued woes of manufacturers, in particular steelmakers, and construction firms. Britain\u2019s building sector shrank by 2.2%, partly because of unusually wet weather in August, while factory output dropped by 0.3%. Manufacturing has been declining for three quarters in a row, marking the seventh recession in the sector since 1997. Industry has been affected by cooling global demand \u2013 especially from China and other emerging markets \u2013 which has been exacerbated by the strong pound. Steel production slumped 7.1% in the third quarter, even before the closure of the Redcar steelworks in north-east England was announced. Frances O\u2019Grady, the TUC general secretary, rebuked George Osborne for failing to protect Britain\u2019s steel industry, and called for a \u201cproper industrial strategy\u201d to rebalance the economy. David Kern, chief economist at the British Chamber of Commerce, said: \u201cOur economic growth remains unbalanced ... The trade deficit also widened in this quarter, and we are still heavily reliant on consumer spending. \u201cNevertheless, it is good news that real GDP is now 6.4% higher than the pre-recession peak in early 2008. What we need now is further measures to boost growth to support the recovery, with particular emphasis on exports and infrastructure investments.\u201d Overall industrial output was boosted by strong mining output after tax changes, and a bounce in oil production, as there were fewer maintenance shutdowns than in previous years, but production growth more than halved to 0.3% from 0.7% in the previous quarter. Agriculture grew by 0.5%. Commenting on the figures, the chancellor said the UK economy continued to outperform other large economies but that Britain must \u201clive within our means\u201d. This is the first official snapshot of economic growth for the quarter and could be subject to revisions in the months ahead. Many economists believe the slowdown is only temporary. Chris Hare, economist at investment bank Investec, noted that data from the construction industry tended to be volatile. \u201cSo looking ahead to the fourth quarter, we expect growth to start edging up again, closer to the 0.7% mark as the third-quarter construction drag goes away, manufacturing growth regains some poise and service sector output growth remains firm.\u201d Zach Witton, deputy chief economist at EEF, the manufacturers\u2019 organisation, said: \u201cThe news wasn\u2019t wholly negative, with bright spots including transport equipment doing well thanks to a backlog of aircraft orders and manufacturers still maintain some, albeit muted, confidence about their longer-term business prospects.\u201d Jeremy Cook, chief economist at World First, the international payments company, said: \u201cThe Bank of England has remained pretty sanguine about the impact on the UK economy of the emerging market rolling over but today\u2019s number will keep the monetary policy committee from doing anything this year.\u201d Azad Zangana, an economist at fund manager Schroders, predicted a May 2016 move: \u201cThe slowdown in UK growth is by no means a disaster, but it will put pressure on the Bank of England to delay the first rate hike, especially as inflation remains in negative territory.\u201d \u2022 An alert to this story said the UK economy had \u201ccontracted\u201d. That should have read \u201cslowed\u201d.",

This was driven by a pick-up in the business services and finance sector, which posted an increase of 1%.</p> <p>This contrasts with the continued woes of manufacturers, in particular steelmakers, and construction firms. Britain\u2019s building sector shrank by 2.2%, partly because of unusually wet weather in August, while factory output dropped by 0.3%. Manufacturing has been declining for three quarters in a row, marking the seventh recession in the sector since 1997.</p> <p>Industry has been affected by cooling global demand \u2013 especially from China and other emerging markets \u2013 which has been exacerbated by the strong pound. Steel production slumped 7.1% in the third quarter, even before the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/oct/02/redcar-steel-plant-goes-into-liquidation\">closure of the Redcar steelworks in north-east England</a> was announced.</p> <p>Frances O\u2019Grady, the TUC general secretary, rebuked <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/georgeosborne\">George Osborne</a> for failing to protect Britain\u2019s steel industry, and called for a \u201cproper industrial strategy\u201d to rebalance the economy.</p> <p>David Kern, chief economist at the British Chamber of Commerce, said: \u201cOur economic growth remains unbalanced ... The trade deficit also widened in this quarter, and we are still heavily reliant on consumer spending. </p> <p>\u201cNevertheless, it is good news that real GDP is now 6.4% higher than the pre-recession peak in early 2008. What we need now is further measures to boost growth to support the recovery, with particular emphasis on exports and infrastructure investments.\u201d</p> <p>Overall industrial output was boosted by strong mining output after tax changes, and a bounce in oil production, as there were fewer maintenance shutdowns than in previous years, but production growth more than halved to 0.3% from 0.7% in the previous quarter. Agriculture grew by 0.5%.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"51aa73f98a634a78653374ab1d2b7e347d7250ce\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/10/27/1445940228023/782512d4-0e00-4fd7-a5b5-7ec872bcca80-460x341.png\" alt=\"GDP and main components\" width=\"460\" height=\"341\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">GDP and main components.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Office for National Statistics</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Commenting on the figures, the chancellor said the UK economy continued to outperform other large economies but that Britain must \u201clive within our means\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/George_Osborne/statuses/658939671779680256\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">GDP is 0.5%.

The educational publisher is down another 14.5p to 890.5p after slumping last week in the wake of a profit warning, which it blamed on a slowdown in enrolments to US colleges and weaker text book sales in South Africa. The company has been selling off divisions such as the Economist and the Financial Times to concentrate on its educational business but this is now currently struggling. The latest catalyst is a downgrade from Credit Suisse, which has moved from outperform to neutral and slashed its target price from \u00a314.55 to 970p. The bank\u2019s analysts said: Whilst we continue to see the potential for longer term upside for the group as it makes the digital migration, we believe these results demonstrate that it is no longer possible to have any meaningful conviction in the group\u2019s short-medium term trading and as such we no longer believe its assets deserve a premium to its more stable professional publishing peers.

      "bodyText": "BP has warned of further job cuts as the company further slashed spending plans after a profit slump caused by the oil price collapse. Profit for the three months to the end of September fell 40% to $1.8bn (\u00a31.2bn), down from $3bn in the same period last year, although the result was better than the $1.2bn analysts had forecast. The plunge in profits is a direct result of the collapse in oil prices, with North Sea Brent blend averaging about $50 a barrel in the last quarter, compared with $102 during the same period in 2014. BP and other oil companies have responded to the low oil price by slashing costs and spending on projects. The company will cut capital spending to as low as $17bn a year in the next two years, from about $19bn this year, down from an estimate of up to $26bn a year ago. The company also slashed non-investment costs by $3bn in the first nine months of the year and plans to cut a further $3bn in the next two years. It is on track to sell about $10bn of assets by the end of this year. Bob Dudley, BP\u2019s chief executive, said spending cuts and further job reductions were needed to keep BP financially strong and support its dividend as he did not expect oil prices to exceed $60 a barrel for the next two years. Dudley said: \u201cWe wanted to give people confidence that in a world of oil at $60 a barrel we would be able to balance the books. We have been at this for about a year and a half now. At BP worldwide, we have about 4,000 less employees than we had a year ago. We have still got costs that need to come out of the system. We will have fewer people.\u201d He did not go into greater detail but said the largest number of job cuts would probably be in the US and about half the savings would come from deferring projects and lower supplier costs. The depressed oil price is the result of increased global supplies, particularly in the US, and slowing world demand for energy as the Chinese economy weakens. The International Energy Agency has said higher production by Opec and slowing world growth mean the price of oil will stay low throughout 2016. The key measure of replacement cost profit before tax from exploration and production plunged 79% to $800m, while profit from so-called downstream activities such as refining increased 53% to $2.3bn. Oil company shares have come under pressure as investors fear the persistently low oil price could force a cut in dividends. Dudley said the company was determined not to reduce its dividend to shareholders of 10 cents a share, up from 9.75 cents a year earlier. \u201cThere is a lot written about oil companies\u2019 dividends and speculation about needing to cut dividends,\u201d he said. \u201cI can tell you, and we spend time with our shareholders, we are committed to maintaining the dividend at BP.\u201d BP shares rose in early trading on Tuesday but were down 0.4% to 383p by early afternoon. Dudley said after BP agreed to pay more than $20m in the US to settle legal actions over the Gulf of Mexico oil spill, the company had cleared uncertainties from the deadly disaster in 2010. \u201cFor the first time in five years, we can begin to plan the company. We need to pace our capital spending and we also have a strong balance sheet. We have lots of flexibility,\u201d he said. The US attorney general, Loretta Lynch, said this month that BP received \u201cthe punishment it deserves\u201d for the spill, which killed 11 people and caused environmental damage. The company\u2019s total bill for the disaster is $55bn after it set aside another $426m in the third quarter. Dudley, who took over after the spill, said: \u201cAll I will say is BP has remained truly committed to meeting our obligations in the US. I don\u2019t think I could point to another company who has ever responded \u2026 like BP.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "A 15-year-old boy has been arrested in Northern Ireland in connection with the cyber-attack on TalkTalk\u2019s website. The arrest is the first major development since the phone and broadband provider said last week it had been hacked, prompting warnings from the company that the bank details and personal information of its four million customers may have been accessed. The boy was arrested in County Antrim at about 4.20pm on Monday by officers from the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI), working with detectives from the Metropolitan police\u2019s cybercrime unit (MPCCU). The teenager was arrested on suspicion of offences under the Computer Misuse Act, police said. He was taken into custody at a County Antrim police station where he will be interviewed. A search of the address is under way and enquiries continue, police said. A statement from TalkTalk said: \u201cWe know this has been a worrying time for customers and we are grateful for the swift response and hard work of the police. We will continue to assist with the ongoing investigation. \u201cIn the meantime, we advise customers to visit http://talktalk.co.uk/secure for updates and information regarding this incident.\u201d Earlier on Monday it was announced that TalkTalk executives are to be summoned before MPs to explain how hackers were able to steal customer bank details as the company continues to try to limit the damage of last week\u2019s cyber-attack. On Monday the culture minister, Ed Vaizey, told the House of Commons that an inquiry into the TalkTalk hack will be launched by Jesse Norman, chair of the culture, media and sport select committee. Shares in the embattled broadband and pay-TV firm fell 12% on Monday as city traders came to terms with the potential fallout of the hacking episode, the third possible data breach in 10 months. It has also emerged that the company could face claims amounting to millions of pounds from fraud victims who lose out as a result of the attack. The company has lost around \u00a3360m in value since it revealed details of the attack last Thursday. TalkTalk said on Saturday that the amount of information was \u201cmaterially lower\u201d than first feared and insisted that it would be impossible for customers to lose any money solely as a result of the cyber-attack. As investigations by both the Metropolitan police and the Information Commissioner\u2019s Office (ICO) continue, the focus is turning to whether the company had properly protected itself, and whether sufficient fines are in place for data breaches. The company chief executive, Dido Harding, insisted in the wake of the hack that the company\u2019s cybersecurity was \u201chead and shoulders\u201d better than its competitors. Security experts have been queuing up to claim that the TalkTalk attack was nothing out of the ordinary, and to point out the company\u2019s failings. One, Adrian Culley, a former Metropolitan police detective and now a security consultant, has likened it to the Great Train robbery and said the potentially liability for TalkTalk could be \u201chuge\u201d. Announcing the inquiry, Vaizey described the hack as \u201cvery serious\u201d, although he said any compensation for customers would be a matter for the information commissioner. An ICO spokesperson said: \u201cOur investigations into previous incidents are ongoing, and it wouldn\u2019t be appropriate to presume a company had breached the Data Protection Act until our enquiries are complete. But what is clear is that organisations do need to make sure they have the appropriate level of security in place to protect the customer information they hold. If they don\u2019t, we will act.\u201d Vaizey said the ICO can already levy \u201csignificant fines\u201d but told MPs he was \u201copen to suggestions\u201d about how the situation could be \u201cimproved\u201d. TalkTalk is facing a maximum fine of \u00a3500,000 despite its annual turnover of \u00a31.8bn a year. The consumer group Which? called on the company to release affected customers without imposing early termination charges. Which? executive director, Richard Lloyd, said: \u201cNobody should lose out as a result of this data breach, so TalkTalk should also look at what more it needs to do for its customers, including appropriate compensation for those affected. It\u2019s important people are treated fairly so we expect that any affected TalkTalk customers who want to leave their contract should be able to do so without penalty.\u201d Exit penalties have to be paid by the customers if they opt to leave mid-contract, and can cost up to \u00a3300 in the telecoms sector. TalkTalk said it would only let customers leave without penalty in the \u201cunlikely event that money is stolen from a customer\u2019s bank account as a direct result of the cyber-attack\u201d. The telecoms regulator Ofcom said on Monday it was \u201cextremely concerned about the data breach and any potential effects\u201d on customers. \u201cUntil all of the facts have been established it is too early to say whether TalkTalk customers would have the right to terminate their contract,\u201d said a spokeswoman. Following a data breach in November 2014, scammers have repeatedly called customers and pretended to be from TalkTalk, while quoting them their account numbers to gain their trust. Having warned them that their computer was under threat of virus, they have successfully taken over the customer\u2019s computer and gone on to apply a sophisticated scam and emptied their bank account. The Guardian is aware of a dozen victims who said this has happened to them, but there are thought to be many more victims. Until now TalkTalk has refused to compensate them because financial information was not leaked.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The UK economy looks like it has been losing momentum, stymied by China\u2019s downturn, a construction slump and ailing manufacturers. Official figures on Tuesday will give a first snapshot of GDP growth in the third quarter, and most economists are predicting a slowdown. The consensus forecast is for quarterly growth of 0.6% in the July-September period, down from 0.7% in the previous quarter, according to a Reuters poll. Here\u2019s what those forecasters will be weighing up: Solid so far So far this year, George Osborne has been able to highlight an economy that on the surface appears to be one of the strongest performers in the G7 group of rich countries. A bounce in oil and gas production, along with a recovery in mining, were the biggest factors behind the UK\u2019s improvement in the second quarter compared with a slower first quarter. A return to healthy growth in the City added to the rosy picture, pushing the UK to second in the G7 growth league behind the US. At 0.7% in the second quarter, UK GDP growth beat that of the G7 put together of 0.6%, and the EU, of 0.4%. But losing steam A series of business surveys and some recent official figures have painted a picture of slowing growth in the UK, as businesses struggle with slower demand at home and from overseas. One set of closely watched surveys, the Markit/CIPS PMI reports, points to GDP growth of 0.5% in the third quarter, lower than the economists\u2019 consensus forecast. Consumers driving growth Consumers continue to drive economic growth, despite a government pledge to rebalance the economy towards more manufacturing and exports and away from reliance on debt-fuelled household spending. Against a backdrop of falling shop prices and a pickup in wage growth, retail sales grew at the fastest rate for almost two years in September, according to the latest official figures. Economists also note a link between rising employment and spending in the UK. The chart above is from Holger Schmieding and Kallum Pickering at Berenberg. They comment: Britons have found a job, and then a shop. The UK recovery has relied on this surge in domestic demand in the last five years, which has proved resilient to a handful of risks such as the general election and, recently, the emerging market rout and China slowdown.\u201d Manufacturers struggling Manufacturers have been struggling to remain competitive in overseas markets as the pound\u2019s relative strength makes their goods more expensive \u2013 even if it does cut the cost of their imports. Businesses have also highlighted a blow to demand from a global slowdown and troubles in China, which has become the UK\u2019s sixth biggest export market. The latest survey of the sector on Monday pointed to a worrying slowdown in domestic demand, too. Manufacturing makes up around a tenth of the UK economy, and after output fell in the first and second quarters, economists are not expecting it to lend any support to overall growth in the third quarter. Simon Wells, chief UK economist at HSBC said: The manufacturing sector is the biggest cause for concern, where several surveys and official data point to a marked slowing in activity. Indeed, manufacturing is already in its third recession in less than a decade, and the level of activity in August 2015 was some 7% below its 2007 peak.\u201d Meanwhile, the wider industrial sector, which on top of manufacturing includes utilities and oil and gas extraction, looks set to have expanded in the third quarter compared with the second. Construction drag Like manufacturing, the construction sector \u2013 which accounts for about 6% of the economy \u2013 is unlikely to have contributed to overall economic growth in the third quarter. Construction experienced sharp drops in output in July and August and it seems unlikely that September saw enough of a rebound to make up for that slow summer. Howard Archer, economist at the consultancy IHS Global Insight, explains: Construction output nosedived 4.3% month on month in August after a drop of 1.0% in July ... Barring any revisions to the July/August data, construction output will need to have grown 8.2% month-on-month in September to have just been flat quarter-on-quarter in the third quarter.\u201d Construction companies say they are struggling to find enough skilled workers to complete jobs.",

The consensus forecast is for quarterly growth of 0.6% in the July-September period, down from <a href=\"http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/naa2/quarterly-national-accounts/q2-2015/qna-stb.html\">0.7% in the previous quarter</a>, according to a Reuters poll.</p> <p>Here\u2019s what those forecasters will be weighing up:</p> <h2>Solid so far</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"db906265866fb69ce13ab9397e72f8cbdb38e9f1\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/10/26/1445867130603/1420a4ac-3b22-4cb4-b48f-b7fbaf4f9257-460x284.png\" alt=\"GDP growth\" width=\"460\" height=\"284\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Quarter-on-quarter growth rates for the UK, EU and G7.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Illustration: ONS</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>So far this year, George Osborne has been able to highlight an economy that on the surface appears to be one of the strongest performers in the G7 group of rich countries. A bounce in oil and gas production, along with a recovery in mining, were the biggest factors behind the UK\u2019s improvement in the second quarter compared with a slower first quarter. A return to healthy growth in the City added to the rosy picture, pushing the UK to second in the G7 growth league behind the US.</p> <p>At 0.7% in the second quarter, UK GDP growth beat that of the G7 put together of 0.6%, and the EU, of 0.4%.</p> <h2>But losing steam</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4238deeb2f43107e4655b504716f55d496ac02fc\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/10/26/1445868439523/940748f4-ea40-492e-902a-7d4137d2e60d-460x303.png\" alt=\"PMI and GDP\" width=\"460\" height=\"303\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The latest PMI surveys for the UK point to growth slowing down in the third quarter.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Illustration: ONS, Markit/CIPS PMI reports</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>A series of business surveys and some recent official figures have painted a picture of slowing growth in the UK, as businesses struggle with <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/oct/26/uk-manufacturers-suffering-slump-demand-cbi-survey\">slower demand at home and from overseas</a>.</p> <p>One set of closely watched surveys, the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/oct/05/uk-economic-growth-slows-dramatically-latest-survey-suggests\">Markit/CIPS PMI reports</a>, points to GDP growth of 0.5% in the third quarter, lower than the economists\u2019 consensus forecast.</p> <h2>Consumers driving growth</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1b550c31912289970d5b719e849a8333bd5d50bf\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/10/26/1445869879727/bc177f1a-6aa6-4531-b0fc-5abb9a48b96b-460x297.png\" alt=\"Rising retail sales\" width=\"460\" height=\"297\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Strong gains in employment have underpinned the recovery in domestic demand, say economists at the bank Berenberg. \ufffc\ufffc\ufffc\ufffc\ufffc\ufffc</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Illustration: ONS and Berenberg</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"6c9406171b4d79ed7ab2ed9a14ae078eb7f2877c\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/10/26/1445870278909/93352b1f-4fca-4c7d-a97c-eb1f5d379f86-280x420.jpeg\" alt=\"Spend, spend, spend.\" width=\"280\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Spend, spend, spend.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: John Stillwell/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Consumers continue to drive economic growth, despite a government pledge to rebalance the economy towards more manufacturing and exports and away from reliance on debt-fuelled household spending. Against a backdrop of falling shop prices and a pickup in wage growth, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/oct/22/falling-prices-rugby-world-cup-boost-uk-retail-sales\">retail sales grew at the fastest rate for almost two years in September</a>, according to the latest official figures.</p> <p> Economists also note a link between rising employment and spending in the UK. The chart above is from Holger Schmieding and Kallum Pickering at Berenberg. They comment:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Britons have found a job, and then a shop. The UK recovery has relied on this surge in domestic demand in the last five years, which has proved resilient to a handful of risks such as the general election and, recently, the emerging market rout and China slowdown.\u201d</p> </blockquote> <h2>Manufacturers struggling<br></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7599b3740849efd0ae8f14e96781727c096b1e26\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/10/26/1445871194276/7d9ae086-264d-4ddf-9d83-fb19523c1ceb-460x336.png\" alt=\"Manufacturing output falling\" width=\"460\" height=\"336\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Manufacturing output fell in the first and second quarters of this year, as shown in this chart.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Illustration: ONS</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Manufacturers have been struggling to remain competitive in overseas markets as the pound\u2019s relative strength makes their goods more expensive \u2013 even if it does cut the cost of their imports. Businesses have also highlighted a blow to demand from a global slowdown and troubles in China, which has become the UK\u2019s sixth biggest export market. The latest survey of the sector on Monday pointed to a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/oct/26/uk-manufacturers-suffering-slump-demand-cbi-survey\">worrying slowdown in domestic demand</a>, too. </p> <p>Manufacturing makes up around a tenth of the UK economy, and after output fell in the first and second quarters, economists are not expecting it to lend any support to overall growth in the third quarter.</p> <p>Simon Wells, chief UK economist at HSBC said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The manufacturing sector is the biggest cause for concern, where several surveys and official data point to a marked slowing in activity. Indeed, manufacturing is already in its third recession in less than a decade, and the level of activity in August 2015 was some 7% below its 2007 peak.\u201d</p> </blockquote> <p>Meanwhile, the wider industrial sector, which on top of manufacturing includes utilities and oil and gas extraction, looks set to have expanded in the third quarter compared with the second. </p> <h2>Construction drag</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"222b8ace9a24a9ad1e3c893da208400b53d1d408\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/10/26/1445872919411/7f05b873-6671-4518-ad4a-076404760473-460x245.png\" alt=\"Construction output\" width=\"460\" height=\"245\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Construction output fell in August and September.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Illustration: Datastream and Daiwa Capital Markets Europe Ltd</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Like manufacturing, the construction sector \u2013 which accounts for about 6% of the economy \u2013 is unlikely to have contributed to overall economic growth in the third quarter. Construction experienced <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/oct/09/construction-skills-shortage-output-slump-august-building-sector\">sharp drops in output in July and August</a> and it seems unlikely that September saw enough of a rebound to make up for that slow summer. </p> <p>Howard Archer, economist at the consultancy IHS Global Insight, explains:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Construction output nosedived 4.3% month on month in August after a drop of 1.0% in July ... Barring any revisions to the July/August data, construction output will need to have grown 8.2% month-on-month in September to have just been flat quarter-on-quarter in the third quarter.\u201d</p> </blockquote> <p>Construction companies say they are <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/jul/27/construction-sector-recovery-at-risk-from-skills-shortage-say-building-firms\">struggling to find enough skilled workers</a> to complete jobs.</p>",
