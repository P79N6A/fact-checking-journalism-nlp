      "bodyText": "One big loser from Greece\u2019s (likely) default is the reputation of the International Monetary Fund. The IMF, we used to believe, only stepped in when a country\u2019s path to debt sustainability was clear and economic revival could be plotted with reasonable confidence. The organisation\u2019s standing as a global lender of last resort relied on the even-handed application of that principle. In Greece, it\u2019s hard to say the debt was ever sustainable in the world after the global financial crisis of 2007-09. In 2010, when the IMF contributed \u20ac30bn to the first bailout programme, Greece hadn\u2019t yet experienced its deep recession. But the risk of deep spending cuts making the position worse was obvious: the unpromising backdrop was a weak eurozone in which banks remained under-capitalised. Indeed, the IMF itself has admitted that it let its lending standards slip in Greece and that its economic projections may have been \u201coverly optimistic\u201d. A 2013 evaluation report confessed there was \u201ca tension between the need to support Greece and the concern that debt was not sustainable with high probability.\u201d The response was \u201cto lower the bar for debt sustainability in systemic cases\u201d. In other words, Greece was viewed as an exceptional case because it was a member of the eurozone, where a blow-up could ricochet around the world. You can\u2019t blame non-eurozone contributors to the IMF coffers for smelling a European rat. The managing director of the IMF in 2010 was Dominique Strauss-Kahn and he was followed by another member of the French financial establishment, Christine Lagarde. Hindsight is perfect but even in 2010 the IMF was behaving out of character. Normally, the body only gets involved when other lenders have been made to accept steep losses. In Greece, debt relief only arrived in the second bailout in 2012 and, even then, private lenders suffered only modest financial pain. Over the past six months of talks, the IMF\u2019s stance on debt write-downs has also been wishy-washy: it seemed to be in favour without ever championing the cause openly. In the end, the IMF, at the head of the queue of creditors, will probably be repaid by Greece. But this saga is an embarrassment. The body watered down long-held lending principles and its economic projections turned out to be worthless. There is fuel there for critics of the IMF who argue the body is designed for the pre-globalisation world of the 1940s. Those voices will grow louder. Thomas Cook Green donation Call it a semi-satisfactory outcome: the former Thomas Cook chief executive, Harriet Green, will get 4.1m shares, worth \u00a35.6m, as her prize for the financial turnaround but will donate a third of the award to charity after \u201cconsultations\u201d with the parents of Christi and Bobby Shepherd, the children who died from carbon monoxide poisoning while on holiday with the tour operator in Corfu. Green, note, was not the boss at the time of the awful events in 2006; nor was the company held directly responsible for the deaths. But she was in charge for part of the period in which Thomas Cook aggravated the parents\u2019 pain by trying to block an inquest in the UK into the deaths. The happy part is that the parents are said by the company to have \u201cexpressed satisfaction\u201d with Green\u2019s donation. The troubling element, from a corporate governance perspective, is that Thomas Cook\u2019s board had no power to reduce Green\u2019s award itself to reflect damage to the company\u2019s reputation. The 4.1m shares flow from the mechanical application of financial measures \u2013 the share price, cash generation and earnings. There was no scope to act outside that remit. New contracts, we are told, include \u201cmalus\u201d provisions \u2013 about time too. Javid CBI jibes Sajid Javid, the business secretary, makes a reasonable point about the CBI: no company would ever approach commercial negotiations in the way the business lobby group is treating the UK\u2019s membership of the European Union. The CBI comes across as so loudly in favour of membership at all costs that its preference for a \u201creformed EU\u201d is relegated to a sub-clause. As noted in here in the past, it\u2019s a bit like easyJet entering price talks with Airbus on new planes by announcing that it is not prepared to buy from Boeing. Negotiating bite is lost at the outset. Javid would like to hear more circumspection from the CBI. Fair enough. But CBI wonks might respond that Javid could level his criticisms at his own boss, David Cameron, who has done little to dispel the impression that a few cosmetic reforms would suffice from the negotiations.",

Sir Richard Branson\u2019s airline said it would be \u201cstructuring the business in a simpler, more efficient way\u201d by cutting 500 jobs in support and managerial roles, through redeployment and redundancies, by the end of the year. The airline returned to profit this year after three years of heavy losses, and chief executive Craig Kreeger has pledged to restore sustained record profits by 2018. Kreeger said: \u201cTo truly position Virgin Atlantic for long-term and sustained success, we need to be a more efficient and agile organisation that has the ability to invest even more in the areas that make Virgin Atlantic\u2019s customer experience unique. \u201cAs a people oriented business, these are extremely tough decisions to take, but we know they are necessary to secure our future. We are committed to supporting our people as we deliver against these plans.\u201d Kreeger added that the airline had \u201cdelivered against a successful recovery programme and now it is time to realise our full potential\u201d. Virgin said it would continue to invest in its fleet and airport lounges, including bringing Wi-Fi and better food on board all of its planes, and newer, fuel-efficient aircraft coming. Five of its 17 Boeing 787 Dreamliners on order are now in service. The airline that was founded in 1984 by Branson has retrenched considerably from more exotic global destinations over the last two years and focused its efforts on lucrative transatlantic routes, in a tie-up with US carrier Delta. Singapore Airlines sold its 49% stake to Delta as Virgin created a partnership to challenge rival British Airways in its tie-up with American Airlines. The joint venture, giving Virgin a much greater reach within the US, has helped underpin its recovery. It recently launched direct routes to Atlanta and Detroit from London. The airline recorded a \u00a314.4m pre-tax profit for 2014, after three years of losses totalling \u00a3230m. Despite Kreeger\u2019s ambitions for the airline to break \u00a3100m profit annually by 2018, the current margin remains only 0.5%. Efforts to run a domestic service, Little Red, between Scotland and Heathrow to feed into its longhaul network foundered, and the domestic airline will cease operations in September. Even with lower fuel costs, Virgin has struggled to translate its brand into solid airline profits, and Kreeger has concluded jobs must go.",

      "bodyText": "Alexis Tsipras chose his moment well. What better way to shift attention from the fact that Greece was about to miss a debt payment to the International Monetary Fund and lose its financial lifeline from its creditors than to come up with a new crisis-resolution plan? It little mattered that the new blueprint from Athens had a shelf life of only a couple of hours before Angela Merkel said there could be no fresh negotiations until after Greece\u2019s referendum on Sunday. The plan put forward by Tsipras was actually pretty clever. It involves extending Greece\u2019s current second bailout, which expires on 30 June, so that it can solve its pressing cash flow problems, and then having a third bailout lasting two years that would include debt relief. But the letter from Tsipras to the chairman of the Eurogroup of finance ministers, Jeroen Dijsselbloem, made no mention of whether Greece was prepared to accept any of the harsh measures demanded by the European Commission, the European Central Bank and the IMF, and he must have known it was only a matter of time before Merkel said nein. She did not wait long. Somehow or other, Greece\u2019s debt burden will be reduced. It can happen through a deal in which Athens gets debt relief for economic reform. Or it can came through a default that would swiftly follow Greek exit from the single currency. Everybody knows this, and it is bizarre that an explicit proposal for debt relief was not formally made to Tsipras in last week\u2019s talks. There was too much stick and too little carrot. But events have moved on. Greece\u2019s Eurogroup partners want to see the result of the referendum before starting new talks. They believe there is a good chance Tsipras will lose the vote, and that his government will fall as a result. So why did Tsipras bother? Simply, he understands that the next few days are a matter of winning hearts and minds and that he needs to rally support for a no vote. One way of doing this is to be the man with a plan seeking to find a solution even at this late hour. Many Greeks are worried about the prospect of going back to the drachma: Tsipras\u2019s latest proposals are designed to show that he doesn\u2019t want that either. His task is made easier by the approach taken by the other side. Jean-Claude Juncker, the president of the European Commission, had nothing to offer in his press conference on Monday. Leading politicians in Germany, Spain, Italy and France have lined up to warn Greeks that if they vote no it will mean leaving the euro. There were reports from Greece on Monday that businesses were threatening employees with the sack if they refused to go on a rally in Athens organised by the yes side. Faced with Project Fear, Tsipras wants to be seen as Mr Reasonable. It might not work. Project Fear, after all, secured a victory for the anti-independence camp in the Scottish referendum on independence. But what Tsipras has done is seize the initiative, something he has proved adept at doing in the five months since he won the Greek general election in January. He has run rings round the troika and continues to do so.",

Many Greeks are worried about the prospect of going back to the drachma: Tsipras\u2019s latest proposals are designed to show that he doesn\u2019t want that either.</p> <p>His task is made easier by the approach taken by the other side. Jean-Claude Juncker, the president of the European Commission, had nothing to offer in his press conference on Monday. Leading politicians in Germany, Spain, Italy and France have lined up to warn Greeks that<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/jun/29/greek-crisis-referendum-eurozone-vote-germany-france-italy\"> if they vote no it will mean leaving the euro</a>. There were reports from Greece on Monday that businesses were threatening employees with the sack if they refused to go on a rally in Athens organised by the yes side. Faced with Project Fear, Tsipras wants to be seen as Mr Reasonable. </p> <p>It might not work. Project Fear, after all, secured a victory for the anti-independence camp in the Scottish referendum on independence. But what Tsipras has done is seize the initiative, something he has proved adept at doing in the five months since he won the Greek general election in January. He has run rings round the troika and continues to do so.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Thomas Cook has confirmed a controversial \u00a35.6m share payout to former chief executive Harriet Green, of which one-third will be donated to charity. The share award is at the lowest end of the range that the holiday firm could have offered \u2013 handing Green 4.1m shares out of a possible 7m. The former boss, who stepped down in November 2014, agreed to donate a third of the payout to charity after an outcry over Thomas Cook\u2019s actions following the deaths of two children on holiday in Corfu in 2006. The firm had been accused of attempting during her tenure to delay the inquest into the deaths of six-year-old Bobby Shepherd and his sister Christi, seven. The siblings, from Horbury, near Wakefield in Yorkshire, died from carbon monoxide poisoning from fumes emitted by a faulty boiler in their Greek island hotel room. An inquest in May returned a verdict of unlawful killing and found Thomas Cook had breached its duty of care. Thomas Cook said the parents were satisfied with the decision of Green to donate some of her payout to charities that aim to raise awareness and improve protection from carbon monoxide. It said Green\u2019s share award was based on an assessment of business performance against several targets including the share price. Thomas Cook\u2019s stock market value rose more than eightfold during Green\u2019s time at the helm. The travel agency said: \u201cThomas Cook also notes and is positive about Ms Green\u2019s commitment to donate a third of her share award to charities chosen after consultations with the parents of Christi and Bobby Shepherd. This would include a substantial donation to a carbon monoxide charity to support the work of the recently launched joint initiative with Thomas Cook to fund research into protection from carbon monoxide, limit the risks associated with it and raise general awareness of the related dangers. The parents of Christi and Bobby Shepherd expressed their satisfaction with this outcome.\u201d Green told the BBC the payout was \u201cin recognition of the work we did together as a team to save the company and put it on a firm foundation for the future, saving the jobs of over 25,000 people, adding \u00a32bn of shareholder value to the business and raising standards for customers. \u201cI am particularly pleased to be able to honour my commitment to give a third of my bonus to charitable causes and am grateful for the support of the parents of Christi and Bobby Shepherd in agreeing these causes.\u201d Despite Green\u2019s turnaround of the ailing firm, she left under a cloud after allegedly alienating key staff, and her payout had been heavily criticised by the Shepherd children\u2019s mother. Thomas Cook faced a consumer backlash on social media after the inquest and its apparent failure to apologise properly to the parents for its role in the tragedy. The current chief executive, Peter Fankhauser, initially claimed there was \u201cno need to apologise\u201d as the coroner had cleared the firm of wrongdoing. It also emerged that Thomas Cook had received \u00a33m in compensation from the hotel owner. Fankhauser later announced the company had donated all the money it had retained after legal fees to Unicef, and met the children\u2019s parents to apologise personally.",

Tim Steiner, chief executive of the company which delivers in vans bearing the slogan \u201ccheaper than you think\u201d, said: \u201cWe are becoming really mainstream and we are taking mainstream customers from the likes of Tesco, Sainsbury\u2019s and Asda. It shows mainstream customers, as opposed to over-affluent customers, are enjoying our service.\u201d In the first half of the financial year, a 30% year-on-year increase in customer acquisitions drove the number of active users of the service up 18.9% to 471,000. In the first half of 2014, there were 396,000 active customers \u2013 classified as someone who has shopped with the service in the previous 12 weeks Ocado\u2019s efforts have been helped by the rise of the smartphone, as many people own them who would have rarely used a computer, according to Steiner. He said Ocado\u2019s association with the upmarket grocery chain Waitrose might have created the idea that its products were pricey. \u201cThe perception rubs off on us and that might be that it is more expensive than it actually is, and that it\u2019s a bit posh,\u201d he said. Ocado\u2019s contract with Waitrose is up for review soon. It said the terms of the deal had limited the amount it could sell under its fast-growing own brand. \u201cWe would clearly like to pay less [to Waitrose] and have more flexibility but Waitrose would like us to pay more and have less flexibility,\u201d Steiner said. Gross sales rose 15.7% to \u00a3512m in the 24 weeks to 17 May but pre-tax profit fell to \u00a37.2m from \u00a37.5m a year earlier. Price cuts amid fierce competition in the sector squeezed profit margins. Ocado was founded in 2000 as a standalone online grocer. After 15 years, it made its first annual profit last year and did a deal to manage Morrisons\u2019 online operation. The contract created new enthusiasm from investors in the belief that Ocado would agree more such deals. Steiner said he was confident it would sign up another retailer during this financial year, which ends in November. The new partner is likely to come from western Europe or North America.",

It said the terms of the deal had limited the amount it could sell under its fast-growing own brand. \u201cWe would clearly like to pay less [to Waitrose] and have more flexibility but Waitrose would like us to pay more and have less flexibility,\u201d Steiner said.</p> <p>Gross sales rose 15.7% to \u00a3512m in the 24 weeks to 17 May but pre-tax profit fell to \u00a37.2m from \u00a37.5m a year earlier. Price cuts amid fierce competition in the sector squeezed profit margins.</p> <p> Ocado was founded in 2000 as a standalone online grocer. After 15 years, it <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/feb/03/ocado-first-annual-profit-waitrose-morrisons\">made its first annual profit last year</a> and did a deal to manage Morrisons\u2019 online operation. The contract created new enthusiasm from investors in the belief that Ocado would agree more such deals.</p> <p>Steiner said he was confident it would sign up another retailer during this financial year, which ends in November. The new partner is likely to come from western Europe or North America.</p>",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Holidaymakers travelling within the EU will pay the same price to use their mobile phone as they would at home from June 2017, after a deal was reached by European authorities. The scrapping of roaming charges has been fiercely resisted by the mobile industry but the agreement on Tuesday comes with a carrot for the telecoms firms \u2013 a parallel deal on internet neutrality that would allow them to charge some service providers for faster connections to their customers. It means companies could potentially pay for priority over rivals under sweeping new internet laws for Europe, which are due to come into force next spring after a period of consultation. It opens the way for companies such as Google, Facebook and Netflix to pay to have better connections than smaller competitors. It will also facilitate new services such as self-driving cars or health monitoring that depend on completely secure connections. Campaigners welcomed fairer pricing for consumers but raised concerns about the net neutrality laws, with one group describing them as \u201cblurry, ambiguous\u201d and \u201can abdication of responsibility\u201d. The agreement, which would overhaul and centralise the way telecoms are regulated in Europe, was reached at 2am after late-night talks between the European commission, members of the European parliament and national ministers. It follows two years of negotiations and U-turns during which the European parliament locked horns with EU governments concerned at the financial impact on their national telecoms groups. Plans to scrap roaming had been scheduled for the end of 2015, but were blocked in March by the European council, whose members are the ministers of national governments. The commission is hailing an end to \u201chuge telephone bills ruining your holiday budget\u201d. This year, mobile operators can still charge travellers to European members states up to 19 cents (14p) a minute for outgoing calls, 5 cents for incoming calls, 6 cents per text message, and 20 cents per megabyte of data downloaded, on top of their normal tariff. From April 2016, in an interim phase, fees will be capped at 5 cents per minute for calls, 2 cents per text and 5 cents per megabyte of data. In June 2017, the surcharges will be scrapped. The Liberal Democrat MEP Catherine Bearder said: \u201cFinally the end of rip-off roaming charges in Europe is firmly in sight. From Riga to Rome, two years from now holidaymakers will be free to use their phones freely wherever they are in the EU. This shows how being in the EU means we can deliver a fairer, cheaper deal for British consumers.\u201d Ernest Doku, telecoms expert at the price comparison site uSwitch.com, said he hoped there would be no more U-turns: \u201cMid 2017 is a long way off, particularly when a fifth of UK holidaymakers have returned home from an EU trip in the past year to find their bill was, on average, \u00a361 higher than usual,\u201d he said. \u201cLet\u2019s hope there\u2019ll be no more backtracking after Europe\u2019s mobile networks have had their say.\u201d The new rules on prioritising internet traffic \u2013 both over fixed-line broadband and mobile phones \u2013 lay the foundation for service providers to be able to pay for more reliable connections. Brussels claims its proposals, which are due to come into law in member states from 30 April 2016, will protect net neutrality by ensuring consumers can access any service online. Traffic would not be \u201cunfairly\u201d blocked or slowed down, the commission announced, and access to a startup, a charity or public service website would not be slowed down to benefit bigger companies. All traffic would be treated equally \u201csubject to strict and clearly identified public-interest exceptions\u201d, such as network security or combating child pornography, and also the need for providers to manage peaks and troughs in usage. However, in parallel, broadband companies will be able to charge for higher quality, dedicated connections for services such as video streaming or \u201cinnovative\u201d applications so long as the rest of the internet is not compromised. \u201cWhat is the point of agreeing to adopt legislation that makes the legal situation less clear than it was before?\u201d said Joe McNamee, executive director of the campaign group European Digital Rights. \u201cNow we have text which could mean almost anything \u2013 we did not need more legal uncertainty.\u201d Those companies allowed to pay to use the internet fast lane will only be able to do so if a better connection is deemed \u201cnecessary\u201d for their service, according to the draft law. But the definition of necessary is too broad, said McNamee. Europe was leaving the job of giving meaning to the new laws to the courts and national regulators, he claimed.",

In June 2017, the surcharges will be scrapped.</p> <p>The Liberal Democrat MEP Catherine Bearder said: \u201cFinally the end of rip-off roaming charges in Europe is firmly in sight. From Riga to Rome, two years from now holidaymakers will be free to use their phones freely wherever they are in the EU. This shows how being in the EU means we can deliver a fairer, cheaper deal for British consumers.\u201d</p> <p>Ernest Doku, telecoms expert at the price comparison site uSwitch.com, said he hoped there would be no more U-turns: \u201cMid 2017 is a long way off, particularly when a fifth of UK holidaymakers have returned home from an EU trip in the past year to find their bill was, on average, \u00a361 higher than usual,\u201d he said. \u201cLet\u2019s hope there\u2019ll be no more backtracking after Europe\u2019s mobile networks have had their say.\u201d</p> <p>The new rules on prioritising internet traffic \u2013 both over fixed-line broadband and mobile phones \u2013 lay the foundation for service providers to be able to pay for more reliable connections.

But the definition of necessary is too broad, said McNamee. Europe was leaving the job of giving meaning to the new laws to the courts and national regulators, he claimed. </p>",

      "bodyText": "If it looks like a default, swims like a default, and quacks like a default, then it\u2019s probably a default. As near-bankrupt Greece hurtles towards its deadline to pay the International Monetary Fund on Tuesday, financial experts are grappling with the question of whether a failure to come up with the cash would constitute a sovereign default. A default occurs when a country, or other borrower, fails to meet its obligation to repay a lender on time. But it is not, technically, the borrower who defaults: it is the lender who declares that the borrower is in default. The credit ratings agencies, which grade the chances of investors getting back the money they have lent to a company or government, have said a missed payment on Tuesday by Greece would not be treated as a default. Neither does a failure to pay the IMF mean that other investors in Greek debt will lose out. At the same time, if Greece does not pay the IMF, the Washington-based organisation will not use the term default, but instead say Greece is in arrears, drawing a distinction between failing to pay bond investors and missing a payment to the fund. Analysts are divided over whether that is just semantics, however. Gary Jenkins, chief credit strategist at LNG Capital, said: \u201cThere has been lots of talk that this is not really a default. Indeed the rating agencies have stated that they would not consider a non-payment as a default. All I can say on this matter is that if you do not pay the absolute last lender of resort I think that\u2019s a default.\u201d Others note that the IMF may have the discretion to grant a grace period to Greece, especially given the referendum is just days away. Greece\u2019s potential access to more rescue funds will be clearer once the vote is out of the way. \u201cIt seems very unlikely that the Greek authorities can or want to pay the \u20ac1.6bn due to the IMF on 30 June. There have been extensive debates about what this technically means and whether that constitutes a default. On the IMF itself, this is not 100% clear,\u201d strategists at RBC Capital Markets wrote this week. \u201cIMF managing director [Christine] Lagarde said in a previous comment that the IMF would not apply any grace periods and would consider Greece to be in arrears straight away. Given the acrimonious deliberations and this weekend\u2019s developments this seems possible. On the other hand, the IMF could also apply a four-week grace period before declaring a state of default. If it opted to do so, this could be bridging the time until after the referendum. We actually think that this is a distinct probability.\u201d Whatever it is called in the end, markets will likely perceive a missed payment of this size \u2013 \u20ac1.6bn (\u00a31.1bn) \u2013 as a default and that will leave Athens struggling to raise further funds from foreign creditors. Greece need only look to Argentina, effectively shut out of international markets for more than a decade after it defaulted on around \u00a358bn of debt in 2001-2002. From investors\u2019 perspective, failure to repay the IMF, of all lenders, would set off alarm bells. Owing the IMF means that the fund has already stepped in to support the economy. Not meeting obligations with the Washington-based fund is rare \u2013 in fact it is unheard of for a developed economy. \u201cWe never had an advanced economy actually asking for that kind of thing, delayed payment,\u201d Lagarde said in April after Greek officials warned they might miss a payment. Lagarde said the IMF had not allowed a country to delay a debt payment in 30 years. Missing a payment to the IMF would put Greece in a club that includes Zimbabwe, Somalia and Sudan, which have all fallen into arrears with the fund. Since the fund\u2019s establishment in 1946, 27 countries have been late with payments by six months or more. No missed payment has been more than \u00a3890m. So Greece\u2019s next payment of \u20ac1.6bn is bigger than any previous case of arrears. As well as the damage to Greece\u2019s reputation on global markets, there will be a blow also to the IMF. And not just because it will not be collecting its money. Once a payment is missed, Greece may have little incentive to pay the IMF the rest of the money it has borrowed. Greece owes the IMF \u20ac23bn by 2030 \u2013 almost four times the total of overdue funds in the IMF\u2019s history, according to Benn Steil, director of international economics at the Council on Foreign Relations. The IMF may have more to lose from a missed Greek payment than Greece because the event would set an unhealthy precedent that undermines the IMF\u2019s authority. \u201cNon-payment by a European state will surely undermine the IMF\u2019s credibility in the eyes of developing countries, and likely accelerate efforts to build alternative institutions,\u201d Steil said in his blog.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Britain\u2019s economy grew faster than initially thought in the opening months of this year but still suffered a marked slowdown compared to the end of 2014. The Office for National Statistics said GDP rose 0.4% in the first quarter from the previous three months. That was in line with City economists\u2019 forecasts after a recent revision to official construction figures showed the sector did not suffer the sharp drop first pencilled in. The latest growth rate was half the 0.8% recorded in the final quarter of last year, also revised up from a previous estimate of 0.6%. Analysts said the slowdown in the first quarter would probably prove temporary and the overall picture was of stronger growth. The growth figure for last year was now 3% \u2013 the strongest since 2006, before the global financial crisis. \u201cThe economic fundamentals look broadly positive for the UK, particularly for the consumer, and we believe growth will be largely healthy through the second half of 2015,\u201d said Howard Archer, economist at IHS Global Insight, forecasting 0.7% growth in the second quarter. He added: \u201cConsumers\u2019 purchasing power should see marked improvement due to extremely low consumer price inflation and strengthening earnings growth, while employment should see decent growth. Furthermore, it currently looks unlikely that interest rates will rise before 2016.\u201d The chancellor, George Osborne, who gives his first budget of the new parliament next week, welcomed the latest growth figures. \u201cToday\u2019s figures are another reminder that the economic plan we\u2019ve pursued in Britain these last five years has increased our resilience \u2013 and we will take whatever further steps are needed to protect the UK from the new risks we see to our economic security,\u201d he said. Household spending remained the main engine of growth in the first quarter with consumers appearing to dip into their savings, while net trade acted as a drag. Exporters have cautioned in recent business surveys that they were struggling with the stronger pound making UK goods more expensive to overseas buyers. Scott Corfe at the Centre for Economics and Business Research thinktank was among the analysts pointing to several clouds on the horizon, including the threat of the Greek crisis precipitating the country out of the euro. \u201cWhile the upward revisions to growth last year and in the first quarter of 2015 paint a more positive picture of the UK economy, we shouldn\u2019t ignore the challenges ahead beyond this year, particularly if the global economy hits a significant stumbling block,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is not improbable given the prospect of Grexit and ongoing geopolitical crises in Russia, the Middle East and elsewhere.\u201d He warned that with borrowing rates already at rock bottom and government debt high, there was limited scope for cushioning any shocks. \u201cThe elephant in the room is that policymakers will be unable to do very much in the event of another downturn \u2013 interest rates are at the lower bound, further benefits from quantitative easing are questionable and fiscal positions across much of the developed world remain poor.\u201d The ONS also released figures on living standards, which showed a slowly improving picture but with still some way to go to return to the levels enjoyed before the downturn. The ONS said GDP per head continued to grow in the first quarter but at a slower pace, rising 0.2% compared with a 0.7% increase in the previous quarter. It remains 0.6% below the pre-downturn peak. The figures follow news from the ONS on Monday that British households are still \u00a3500 a year worse off than before the financial crisis in 2008. The UK\u2019s trading position was also cause for concern, economists said. Figures alongside the GDP data on the UK\u2019s current account deficit \u2013 made up of the trade deficit, plus losses on overseas ventures \u2013 came in worse than expected. The current account deficit fell to \u00a326.5bn from an upwardly revised \u00a328.9bn, but was bigger than the \u00a323.8bn forecast in a Reuters poll of economists. It was equivalent to 5.8% of GDP, down from 6.4% in the fourth quarter of 2014. For 2014 as a whole, the deficit was 5.9% of GDP, the highest since records began in 1948. The British Chambers of Commerce said Britain\u2019s wide current account gap was as big a risk to the UK\u2019s economic outlook as the eurozone crisis and it criticised ministers for failing to bring the margin down. \u201cThe size and persistence of the UK\u2019s current account deficit make us hugely vulnerable to external shocks, unexpected shifts in market sentiment and unwelcome downgrades to our credit rating,\u201d said John Longworth, the lobby group\u2019s director general. \u201cWhile it is good to see some improvement over the quarter, the huge current account deficit should be setting off alarm bells. Recent improvements mask long-term falls in net investment and overseas income, as well as our lacklustre export performance. These issues merit immediate and sustained attention, both in Westminster and in boardrooms across Britain.\u201d",

That was in line with City economists\u2019 forecasts after a recent <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/jun/12/uk-economic-growth-revised-up-as-ons-paints-brighter-picture-of-construction\">revision to official construction figures</a> showed the sector did not suffer the sharp drop first pencilled in.<br></p> <p>The latest growth rate was half the 0.8% recorded in the final quarter of last year, also revised up from a previous estimate of 0.6%.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"http://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2015/06/gdp-zip/giv-21277dnvDdWO9QzXr\" data-alt=\"UK GDP for first quarter 2015\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2015/06/gdp-zip/giv-21277dnvDdWO9QzXr\">UK GDP for first quarter 2015</a> <figcaption>UK GDP for first quarter 2015</figcaption> </figure>  <p>Analysts said the slowdown in the first quarter would probably prove temporary and the overall picture was of stronger growth. The growth figure for last year was now 3% \u2013 the strongest since 2006, before the global financial crisis.</p> <p>\u201cThe economic fundamentals look broadly positive for the UK, particularly for the consumer, and we believe growth will be largely healthy through the second half of 2015,\u201d said Howard Archer, economist at IHS Global Insight, forecasting 0.7% growth in the second quarter.<br></p> <p>He added: \u201cConsumers\u2019 purchasing power should see marked improvement due to extremely low consumer price inflation and strengthening earnings growth, while employment should see decent growth. Furthermore, it currently looks unlikely that interest rates will rise before 2016.\u201d</p> <p>The chancellor, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/jun/25/a-chancellor-in-his-pomp-emboldened-george-osborne-eyes-budget-day\">George Osborne</a>, who gives his first budget of the new parliament next week, welcomed the latest growth figures. \u201cToday\u2019s figures are another reminder that the economic plan we\u2019ve pursued in Britain these last five years has increased our resilience \u2013 and we will take whatever further steps are needed to protect the UK from the new risks we see to our economic security,\u201d he said.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/hmtreasury/statuses/615804954075226112\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">.<a href=\"https://twitter.com/ONS\">@ONS</a> has released its final estimate of UK <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/GDP?src=hash\">#GDP</a> for the first quarter.

Exporters have cautioned in recent business surveys that they were struggling with the stronger pound making UK goods more expensive to overseas buyers.</p> <p>Scott Corfe at the Centre for Economics and Business Research thinktank was among the analysts pointing to several clouds on the horizon, including the threat of the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2015/jun/30/greek-debt-crisis-day-of-decision-for-tsipras\">Greek crisis</a> precipitating the country out of the euro. </p> <p>\u201cWhile the upward revisions to growth last year and in the first quarter of 2015 paint a more positive picture of the UK economy, we shouldn\u2019t ignore the challenges ahead beyond this year, particularly if the global economy hits a significant stumbling block,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cThis is not improbable given the prospect of Grexit and ongoing geopolitical crises in Russia, the Middle East and elsewhere.\u201d</p> <p>He warned that with borrowing rates already at rock bottom and government debt high, there was limited scope for cushioning any shocks.</p> <p>\u201cThe elephant in the room is that policymakers will be unable to do very much in the event of another downturn \u2013 interest rates are at the lower bound, further benefits from quantitative easing are questionable and fiscal positions across much of the developed world remain poor.\u201d</p> <p>The ONS also released figures on living standards, which showed a slowly improving picture but with still some way to go to return to the levels enjoyed before the downturn.<br></p> <p>The ONS said GDP per head continued to grow in the first quarter but at a slower pace, rising 0.2% compared with a 0.7% increase in the previous quarter. It remains 0.6% below the pre-downturn peak.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"16dc27758af341aee64c2aedbabbb1e22e4c3f3c\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/30/1435654521031/54b08570-885e-43fe-b289-63f2648b7460-460x288.png\" alt=\"Quarterly growth of GDP and GDP per head for the UK\" width=\"460\" height=\"288\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Quarterly growth of GDP and GDP per head for the UK.

Figures alongside the GDP data on the<a href=\"http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/bop/balance-of-payments/q1-2015/index.html\"> UK\u2019s current account deficit</a> \u2013 made up of the trade deficit, plus losses on overseas ventures \u2013 came in worse than expected.<br></p> <p>The current account deficit fell to \u00a326.5bn from an upwardly revised \u00a328.9bn, but was bigger than the \u00a323.8bn forecast in a Reuters poll of economists. It was equivalent to 5.8% of GDP, down from 6.4% in the fourth quarter of 2014. For 2014 as a whole, the deficit was 5.9% of GDP, the highest since records began in 1948.</p> <p>The British Chambers of Commerce said Britain\u2019s wide current account gap was as big a risk to the UK\u2019s economic outlook as the eurozone crisis and it criticised ministers for failing to bring the margin down.</p> <p>\u201cThe size and persistence of the UK\u2019s current account deficit make us hugely vulnerable to external shocks, unexpected shifts in market sentiment and unwelcome downgrades to our credit rating,\u201d said John Longworth, the lobby group\u2019s director general.</p> <p>\u201cWhile it is good to see some improvement over the quarter, the huge current account deficit should be setting off alarm bells. Recent improvements mask long-term falls in net investment and overseas income, as well as our lacklustre export performance. These issues merit immediate and sustained attention, both in Westminster and in boardrooms across Britain.\u201d</p>",
