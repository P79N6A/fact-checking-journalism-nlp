      "bodyText": "Tips in restaurants, hotels and bars should go to workers and not their employers, the government said in a report published on Monday. After an eight-month review of tipping practices, the government said charges imposed on staff tips by employers should be scrapped or limited. Service charges on customers\u2019 bills should also be clear and voluntary, the proposals said. The business secretary, Sajid Javid, launched the investigation last August after some of Britain\u2019s best-known restaurant chains were exposed for withholding some or all of the service charges from staff \u2013 often without customers\u2019 knowledge. Unions accused businesses such as Pizza Express and Giraffe of abusing the 2009 voluntary code set up to stop tips being used by employers to meet the minimum wage. Pizza Express, which took 8% of tips paid on a card, and Giraffe, which charged 10%, have since stopped doing so. Chains such as the Mexican street food outlet Wahaca and Jamie Oliver\u2019s Jamie\u2019s Italian have also deducted a percentage of waiters\u2019 card sales to be shared with other workers, but other restaurants have used tips to pay for breakages, till shortfalls and customers failing to pay. The government is seeking views on options to ensure staff get more of their tips including: Banning employer deductions from discretionary service payments other than for tax. Limiting such deductions to the cost of processing credit card tips and dealing with the payment through payroll. Banning or restricting employers from charging waiting staff a percentage of their table sales during a shift. Encouraging properly managed \u201ctroncs\u201d \u2013 arrangements for sharing tips administered by a staff member, not the employer. Publishing the report, Javid said: \u201cWe want workers who earn a tip to be able to keep it. That\u2019s why I, like many others, was disappointed by the tipping practices of some of our well-known chains. This has to change.\u201d Javid said the government would decide whether to make changes by revamping the 2009 code or, to give the rules more weight, enshrining them in legislation. The Unite union, whose campaign helped expose restaurant chains\u2019 treatment of tips, said the report was a \u201cmassive, rightful victory\u201d and called on Javid to change the law instead of relying on the voluntary code. Dave Turnbull, Unite\u2019s officer for the hospitality industry, said: \u201cThe problem has always been that tips paid on a credit card and service charges are deemed the property of the employer. Until staff are recognised as the lawful owners of their hard-earned tips with complete control over how they are shared out, rogue employers will continue to cream off staff tips.\u201d The proposals also attempt to clear up confusion and dubious practices around service charges added to bills that often go to the employer and not staff. There is no legal requirement for any part of these optional payments to be paid to employees. The government said customers often did not understand the charges were at their discretion and that they deterred diners from leaving a tip on top. Businesses could be banned from adding a service charge or forced to make it clearer that the charge is discretionary. Cover charges imposed by the restaurant also need to be made clearer so consumers know what they will pay, the government said. This article was amended on 3 May. Pizza Express and Giraffe have confirmed that they no longer take a percentage of tips paid on credit cards.",

    "webTitle": "Corporate wrongdoing now endemic in Australia, report shows", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Corporate wrongdoing has become endemic in Australia, with hundreds of cases being pursued by the country\u2019s regulators each year, and with few signs of their workloads lightening, a new report has found. But there are also fewer regulators \u201cpatrolling the corporate beat\u201d in Australia than there were three years ago, with government agencies that monitor corporate malfeasance having their staffing cut by 3,926 people in total \u2013 or 14.9% \u2013 since the 2013-14 budget. The left-leaning think-tank the Australia Institute has released a new report, called Corporate Malfeasance in Australia, that shows the extent of wrongdoing in the country\u2019s corporate sector. It calls on the Turnbull government to restore staffing budgets and resources for key agencies such as the Australian Tax Office (ATO) and the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (Asic), among others, to combat the problem. It comes two weeks after the government promised to restore funding to Asic by forcing Australia\u2019s banks to pay for a multimillion-dollar upgrade to Asic\u2019s surveillance systems \u2013 a move designed to help the regulator improve its ability to thwart corporate wrongdoing, much diminished by a $120m funding cut in the Abbott government\u2019s 2014 budget. There is no database in Australia that gives a complete view of the corporate sector\u2019s wrongdoing, and the AI report is an attempt to address that information gap, it says. The report surveys data published by Asic, the ATO, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC), Fair Work Ombudsman, Fair Work Commission, and Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS), in some cases stretching back a decade. \u201cThe extent of wrongdoing among Australian companies and businesses is surprisingly high,\u201d the report says. \u201cThe publications of official agencies demonstrates that malfeasance by the private sector is widespread.\u201d The report shows Asic has concluded 3,115 cases against corporations over the last four-and-a-half years, of which 2,095 were criminal matters. It took action against building and construction firms in 10,667 cases, over the last five years. The report says: \u201cThis is unlikely to represent the full extent of non-compliance by corporations with relevant legal requirements because Asic, like most regulators, has limited resources and a reluctance to take formal proceedings unless there is a very high prospect of success\u201d. The report shows the ATO has been prosecuting an average of 450 companies a year since 2011-12, but that number fell to 300 in 2014-15, \u201cpossibly due to the staffing and other resource constraints.\u201d It shows the ATO still recovered $3.5bn in tax in 2014-15 from companies attempting to hide their profits. \u201c[But] companies also try to underpay the GST and other indirect taxes as well as PAYG on behalf of their employees; those amounted to $6.3bn in [2014-15],\u201d it says. The report also shows the ACCC, over the past 10 years, has taken action against companies on 669 instances; the Fair Work Ombudsman, over the nine years for which we have data, recovered $250m for over 174,000 employees and finalised 217,000 separate complaints; in the six years to 2014-15 the Fair Work Commission saw a total of 71,106 claims lodged for unfair dismissal and roughly 80% of those were settled at conciliation. The report\u2019s authors say staffing levels at Australia\u2019s key regulatory agencies have been significantly hit in the past three years. It shows the government has cut Asic\u2019s staff numbers by 14.4% since 2013-14 \u2013 from 1,834 to 1,569. The ATO has had staff numbers cut by 16.1% since 2013-14, from 22,022 to 18,482. The head of Asic, Greg Medcraft, has admitted budget cuts enacted by the Coalition have compromised the corporate watchdog\u2019s ability to engage in proactive investigations. \u201cIt is difficult to understand the rationale for these cuts, given the official publications of the relevant agencies show that corporate wrongdoing is widespread in Australia,\u201d the AI report says. \u201cThe publications of official agencies demonstrates that malfeasance by the private sector is widespread in Australia. The staff and resources needed to reduce this wrongdoing and to enforce corporate and workplace laws must be restored to the relevant regulators and government agencies.\u201d Labor leader Bill Shorten has been calling for a royal commission into the banking and financial services industries to confront the amount of corporate malfeasance in Australia. Shorten says the sector had been rocked by a string of scandals that are \u201cnot isolated and one-off examples\u201d but rather point to systemic problems in the industries.",

      "bodyText": "Last week\u2019s inflation figures showed that prices actually fell on average in the first three months of this year. The figures set off strong speculation that Tuesday will see an interest rate cut from the Reserve Bank. But while low inflation is a sign of a lack of demand in the economy, the latest figures suggest that the treasurer, Scott Morrison, is the one who needs to act, rather than the RBA governor, Glenn Stevens. We currently live in a world of very low inflation \u2013 historically so. We have become so used to low inflation that three months ago annual inflation growth of 1.7% was seen as too high to allow an interest rate cut. In previous years such a level would have been seen as scarily low. Prepare to get scared. The Australian Bureau of Statistics found that in the first three months of this year prices fell by 0.2% (the first such fall since December 2008) and annual inflation came in at a carpet-burning low of 1.3%: Underlying inflation, which is generally seen as the guide for interest rate decisions, also recorded very weak results. In the March quarter the two measures of underlying inflation \u2013 the trimmed mean and the weighted median rose \u2013 by just 0.2% and 0.1% respectively: This saw the weighted median recording a record low annual growth of 1.4% and the trimmed mean tying its record low of 1.7%: However you want to cut it, inflation growth is near enough to \u201cbugger all\u201d to call it thus without risking serious error. The market reacted swiftly. On Monday the futures market was pricing in a 16% chance of a rate cut tomorrow; by the end of trading on Tuesday it was rated a 53% chance, by Friday it was 58%: The market now fully expects a rate cut by August and a 50% chance of another cut to 1.5% by February next year. A big reason for the deflation in the March quarter was petrol. Falling oil prices in January and February saw automotive fuel prices drop 10% in the March quarter \u2013 the sixth-largest fall in a quarter since the ABS started recording fuel prices in 1972: Since February, however, oil prices have been rising slowly, so it is likely that the June quarter will see fuel prices rising on average. But fuel wasn\u2019t the biggest fall in the quarter \u2013 that title went to fruit, which fell 11.1%. Although the fall was less when seasonally adjusted, even on that measure it was the second biggest fall. Fruit, like automotive fuel, is classed as a \u201ctradeable\u201d item \u2013 one that has its price determined significantly outside our borders \u2013 and it was such items that really drove the fall in inflation. Tradable items fell 1.4% in the March quarter \u2013 the biggest fall since December 2008: But over the past year it is non-tradable items that are showing record weak growth. In the past 12 months the price of non-tradables items (such as takeway food, rents, utilities charges, house prices, health and education expenses) increased by just 1.7% - the lowest this century: This low price growth of such goods and services really reflects the lack of demand in the economy and why many expect the RBA to cut rates. But should the RBA do it? Over the past few years one key aspect of the government\u2019s budget strategy is the decided lack of interest in stimulating demand in the economy. Essentially Joe Hockey hoped the private sector with the assistance of low interest rates would do the job. But thus far there is little sign of that strategy working. The latest producer price figures released on Friday showed domestic final demand (excluding exports) fell by 0.2% in the March quarter and the annual growth of just 0.8% is a level usually associated with recessions. The December mid-year fiscal and economic outlook revised up the level of growth of public demand for this year to 2.0% from the 1.5% expected in last year\u2019s budget. But it made no change for 2016-17: A key measure to look for in Tuesday\u2019s budget is whether or not the government is to increase public demand \u2013 in effect trying to stimulate the economy through fiscal spending. Clearly the signs are there won\u2019t be any major spending of a traditional sort but there is strong talk that the government will use \u201coff-budget\u201d measures to pay for infrastructure. Such spending may not increase the deficit but it should increase public demand growth. The RBA would be glad to see it. Stevens has for a long time been warning that lowering rates doesn\u2019t have the power to boost the economy that it once did. Just two weeks ago he told an audience in New York that \u201cwhile people find global growth outcomes still a bit disappointing, we are reaching the limits of monetary policy in boosting it\u201d. He argued that \u201ccentral banks must of course do what they can\u201d but \u201csurely diminishing returns are setting in\u201d and he suspected \u201cthat more and more people realise this\u201d. But the question is whether or not the treasury realises this or whether he still wants to leave it up to lower interest rates to do the heavy lifting.",

      "bodyText": "The penalty for running a bad business is supposed to be failure. A free market system relies on the incentive of reward earned through enterprise, but it must also contain risk. The theory holds that evolution is at work, as good business thrives by innovation and competition, while the weak fall away. Meanwhile, democratic governments provide social guarantees so that this natural selection does not inflict cruelty on the citizens who depend on the economy for their livelihoods. That is why the ruin of BHS is a story of political failure as well as a product of commercial mismanagement. The collapse of the famous high street chain, leaving 11,000 jobs in jeopardy and a staff pension fund with a \u00a3571m deficit, has been widely reported as a case study of corporate greed. There have been calls for Sir Philip Green, who owned the company for 15 years, to be stripped of his knighthood. Sir Philip, his wife and Dominic Chappell, who heads Retail Acquisitions \u2013 the consortium that later bought BHS \u2013 look set to be summoned by parliament\u2019s business and work and pensions committees, as part of twin inquiries into the affairs of what is now a hollowed-out shell of a company in administrators\u2019 hands. If these probes go ahead, they might shed some light on the mechanisms by which the value that there once was in BHS was apparently turned to cash and siphoned off. That is if Sir Philip and others deign to attend the committees. They might, like Mike Ashley \u2013 the founder of Sports Direct, who now offers himself as an unlikely saviour of the BHS workforce \u2013 defy a summons to appear.

      "bodyText": "Talks for a free trade deal between Europe and the US face a serious impasse with \u201cirreconcilable\u201d differences in some areas, according to leaked negotiating texts. The two sides are also at odds over US demands that would require the EU to break promises it has made on environmental protection. President Obama said last week he was confident a deal could be reached. But the leaked negotiating drafts and internal positions, which were obtained by Greenpeace and seen by the Guardian, paint a very different picture. \u201cDiscussions on cosmetics remain very difficult and the scope of common objectives fairly limited,\u201d says one internal note by EU trade negotiators. Because of a European ban on animal testing, \u201cthe EU and US approaches remain irreconcilable and EU market access problems will therefore remain,\u201d the note says. Talks on engineering were also \u201ccharacterised by continuous reluctance on the part of the US to engage in this sector,\u201d the confidential briefing says. These problems are not mentioned in a separate report on the state of the talks, also leaked, which the European commission has prepared for scrutiny by the European parliament. These outline the positions exchanged between EU and US negotiators between the 12th and the 13th round of TTIP talks, which took place in New York last week. The public document offers a robust defence of the EU\u2019s right to regulate and create a court-like system for disputes, unlike the internal note, which does not mention them. Jorgo Riss, the director of Greenpeace EU, said: \u201cThese leaked documents give us an unparalleled look at the scope of US demands to lower or circumvent EU protections for environment and public health as part of TTIP. The EU position is very bad, and the US position is terrible. The prospect of a TTIP compromising within that range is an awful one. The way is being cleared for a race to the bottom in environmental, consumer protection and public health standards.\u201d US proposals include an obligation on the EU to inform its industries of any planned regulations in advance, and to allow them the same input into EU regulatory processes as European firms. American firms could influence the content of EU laws at several points along the regulatory line, including through a plethora of proposed technical working groups and committees. \u201cBefore the EU could even pass a regulation, it would have to go through a gruelling impact assessment process in which the bloc would have to show interested US parties that no voluntary measures, or less exacting regulatory ones, were possible,\u201d Riss said. The US is also proposing new articles on \u201cscience and risk\u201d to give firms greater regulatory say. Disputes over pesticides residues and food safety would be dealt with by the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation\u2019s Codex Alimentarius system. Environmentalists say the body has loose rules on corporate influence, allowing employees of companies such as BASF, Nestle and Coca Cola to sit on \u2013 and sometimes lead \u2013 national delegations. Some 44% of its decisions on pesticides residues have been less stringent than EU ones, with 40% of rough equivalence and 16% being more demanding, according to Greenpeace. GM foods could also find a widening window into Europe, with the US pushing for a working group to adopt a \u201clow level presence initiative\u201d. This would allow the import of cargo containing traces of unauthorised GM strains. The EU currently blocks these because of food safety and cross-pollination concerns. The EU has not yet accepted the US demands, but they are uncontested in the negotiators\u2019 note, and no counter-proposals have been made in these areas. In January, the EU trade commissioner Cecilia Malmstr\u00f6m said [pdf] the precautionary principle, obliging regulatory caution where there is scientific doubt, was a core and non-negotiable EU principle. She said: \u201cWe will defend the precautionary approach to regulation in Europe, in TTIP and in all our other agreements.\u201d But the principle is not mentioned in the 248 pages of TTIP negotiating texts. The European commission has also promised to safeguard environmental laws, defend international standards and protect the EU\u2019s right to set high green benchmarks in future. But the new leak will not placate critics of the deal, who have pointed to attempts by fossil fuel firms and others to influence its outcome, as a sign of things to come. The EU negotiators internal note says \u201cthe US expressed that it would have to consult with its chemical industry on how to position itself\u201d on issues of market access for non-agricultural goods. Where industry lobbying in regulatory processes is concerned, the US also \u201cinsisted\u201d that the EU be \u201crequired\u201d to involve US experts in its development of electrotechnical standards.",

      "bodyText": "Travelling around Thailand in the 1990s, William Janssen was impressed with the basic rooftop solar heating systems that were on many homes, where energy from the sun was absorbed by a plate and then used to heat water for the home. Two decades later and Janssen has developed that basic idea he saw in south-east Asia into a portable device that uses the power from the sun to purify water. The \u201cDesolenator\u201d operates as a mobile desalination unit that can take water from the sea, rivers and boreholes \u2013 as well as rain \u2013 and clean it for human consumption. The device, which looks like a thick solar photovoltaic panel on wheels, is aimed at a wide range of users \u2013 from homeowners in the developing world who do not have a constant supply of water to people living off the grid in rural parts of the US. Janssen saw that there was a need for a sustainable way to clean water in both the developing and the developed countries when he moved to the United Arab Emirates and saw large-scale water processing. \u201cI was confronted with the enormous carbon footprint that the Gulf nations have because of all of the desalination that they do ,\u201d he said. The Desolenator, which measures 120cm by 90cm, is a solar panel that converts sunlight into electricity, but also uses the heat that is generated from the sun as part of the process. In operation, water flows over the panel and soaks up the heat to bring it to a high temperature. It then flows into a small boiler in the device, which is powered by the electricity produced from the solar panel, and converted to steam. The steam is then converted back into cleaned water via a tube that changes the temperature again, while the waste flows out of the machine. Boiling the water gets rid of pollutants, said Janssen, such as arsenic and fluoride. \u201cThe device has a particle filter, a very simple filter which you can just shake empty, and the device is ready to deal with water which is slightly cloudy or slightly murky. It just flows through,\u201d he said. There are two tubes for liquid coming out \u2013 one for the brine waste and another for the distilled water. The water flows constantly through the device during the cleaning process \u2013 one litre flows through a number of times \u2013 and small volumes of water are distilled through boiling and heat exchange. It can produce 15 litres of distilled water in a day, which Janssen said is enough to sustain a family for cooking and drinking. An analysis released earlier this year found at least two-thirds of the world\u2019s population live with severe water scarcity for at least a month every year. Janssen said that by 2030, half of the world\u2019s population will be living with water stress \u2013 where the demand exceeds the supply over a certain period of time. \u201cIt is really important that a sustainable solution is brought to the market that is able to help these people and make sure there is an independence for themselves to be protected from this crisis,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you go to places like Somalia, Yemen or Bangladesh, it is an immense problem because these people don\u2019t have the money for desalination plants, which are very expensive to build. They don\u2019t have the money to operate them, they are very maintenance intensive and they don\u2019t have the money to buy the diesel to run the desalination plants so it is really bad situation.\u201d The first commercial versions of the Desolenator are expected to be in operation in India early next year, after field tests are carried out. The market for the self-sufficient devices in developing countries is twofold \u2013 those who cannot afford the money for the device outright and pay through microfinance or by use, and middle income homes who can lease their own equipment. \u201cPeople in India don\u2019t pay for a fridge outright, they pay for it over six months. They would put the Desolenator on their roof and hook it up to their municipal supply and they would get very get very reliable drinking water on a daily basis,\u201d he said. In the developed world, it is aimed at niche markets where tap water is unavailable \u2013 for camping, on boats, for the military or even for survivalists preparing for a doomsday scenario. Prices will vary on where it is bought. In the developing world, the price will depend on what deal aid organisations can negotiate. In developed countries, it is likely to come in at $1,000 (\u00a3685) a unit, said Janssen. \u201cWe are a venture with a social mission. We are aware that the product we have envisioned is mainly finding application in the developing and humanitarian world and that this the way we will proceed. We do realise that to be a viable company there is a bottom line to keep in mind,\u201d he said. The company itself is based at Imperial College London although Janssen, its chief executive, still lives in the UAE. It has so far raised \u00a3340,000 in funding. Within two years, he said, the company aims to be selling 1,000 units a month, mainly in the humanitarian field. They are expected to be sold in areas such as Australia, northern Chile, Peru, Texas and California. \u2022 You can read our archive of The Innovators columns on the Big Innovation Centre website where you will find more information on how Big Innovation Centre supports innovative enterprise in Britain and globally.",

      "body": "<p>Travelling around Thailand in the 1990s, William Janssen was impressed with the basic <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_water_heating#Powering_a_heat-pump_hot_water_heater_via_solar_PV_panels\">rooftop solar heating systems</a> that were on many homes, where energy from the sun was absorbed by a plate and then used to heat water for the home. <br></p> <p>Two decades later and Janssen has developed that basic idea he saw in south-east Asia into a portable device that uses the power from the sun to purify water.<br></p> <p>The \u201c<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/small-business-network/2015/feb/02/showcase-startup-of-the-year-desolenator\">Desolenator</a>\u201d operates as a mobile desalination unit that can take water from the sea, rivers and boreholes \u2013 as well as rain \u2013 and clean it for human consumption. The device, which looks like a thick solar photovoltaic panel on wheels, is aimed at a wide range of users \u2013 from homeowners in the developing world who do not have a constant supply of water to people living off the grid in rural parts of the US.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"28877a55e1ef879ffed5b71f7f856ce00ed5dd60\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/28877a55e1ef879ffed5b71f7f856ce00ed5dd60/24_322_2307_2307/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Dutch engineer William Janssen has created the Desolenator.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dutch engineer William Janssen has created the Desolenator.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: William Janssen</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Janssen saw that there was a need for a sustainable way to clean water in both the developing and the developed countries when he moved to the United Arab Emirates and saw large-scale water processing. \u201cI was confronted with the enormous carbon footprint that the Gulf nations have because of all of the desalination that they do ,\u201d he said.</p> <p>The Desolenator, which measures 120cm by 90cm, is a solar panel that converts sunlight into electricity, but also uses the heat that is generated from the sun as part of the process. In operation, water flows over the panel and soaks up the heat to bring it to a high temperature. It then flows into a small boiler in the device, which is powered by the electricity produced from the solar panel, and converted to steam. The steam is then converted back into cleaned water via a tube that changes the temperature again, while the waste flows out of the machine. </p> <p>Boiling the water gets rid of pollutants, said Janssen, such as arsenic and fluoride. \u201cThe device has a particle filter, a very simple filter which you can just shake empty, and the device is ready to deal with water which is slightly cloudy or slightly murky. It just flows through,\u201d he said. There are two tubes for liquid coming out \u2013 one for the brine waste and another for the distilled water.</p> <p>The water flows constantly through the device during the cleaning process \u2013 one litre flows through a number of times \u2013 and small volumes of water are distilled through boiling and heat exchange. It can produce 15 litres of distilled water in a day, which Janssen said is enough to sustain a family for cooking and drinking. </p> <p> An <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/feb/12/four-billion-people-face-severe-water-scarcity-new-research-finds\">analysis released earlier this year</a> found at least two-thirds of the world\u2019s population live with severe water scarcity for at least a month every year.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "It\u2019s a question that has haunted the minds of high-flying financiers, self-help authors and regular Americans for decades: what\u2019s the best way to make money investing? In the past, the best way, hands down, was to have won the genetic lot: to have been born so that your peak earning and investing years coincided with a bull market. If you came of age in the early 1980s and started investing, you\u2019ve already won the game. Those years saw an extraordinary bull market in the bond market, and the three decades since included what became a golden age for stock market investors. Sure, the stock market\u2019s path was a bumpy one, with downturns, mini-crashes and other more serious bursts, like of the dotcom bubble in 2000. Overall, however, returns greatly exceeded historical averages, and recessions cleared the way for the market to climb to greater heights. Consulting company McKinsey is now warning us that the factors that contributed to those golden age returns don\u2019t exist any more. But the era lasted long enough to make Americans think of it as normal, and to leave us wondering about what feels like an \u201cabnormal\u201d environment of volatile markets and mediocre returns. That, the McKinsey analysts argue in a new report making waves throughout the investment world, is precisely the wrong way to look at the whole matter. It was those abnormally high returns that were unusual, they point out. Now we\u2019re heading into a period of compressed or collapsing investment returns, and we\u2019ll need to adjust all our expectations and behavior accordingly. The McKinsey study attributes the exceptional returns to four unusual factors. A sharp decline in US inflation rates, to well below their historic average, led to a rise in the price that investors were willing to pay for every dollar of corporate earnings, or the much-discussed price/earnings ratio. A steep drop in interest rates boosted returns from bonds and also helped buoy stock prices. While global GDP growth was normal during the golden era, the researchers found that demographics in emerging markets and improving productivity worldwide boosted corporate profits and revenues, and contributed to stock market returns. Then there\u2019s the unprecedented surge in corporate profits in the last three decades: US companies never had it so good. These factors are gone. It\u2019s time to brace for a period in which investment returns could be lower than long-term averages. Between 1985 and 2014, the US stock market delivered returns of 7.9%, on average, every year; the bond market rewarded investors with an average annual return of 5%. Over the next 20 years, look for those figures to shrink to as little as 4% to 5% for stocks (if you\u2019re cautious about the economic outlook), and zero to 0.1% for bonds. If you take a more upbeat view of the economy, you can ratchet the figures up to 5.5% to 6.5% for stocks, and 1% to 2% for stocks. Well, that\u2019s OK, isn\u2019t it? You could put all your money in stocks and ignore bonds \u2013 how much difference can a percentage point or two make? You could also put all your eggs in a proverbial basket, and ignore the details. While you\u2019d be right to favor stocks in any asset allocation model (they tend to perform better over the long haul), you also need diversity. As the crisis of 2008 reminded us all, there will be periods when if you don\u2019t have at least part of your portfolio in safer investments, such as bonds, you\u2019ll end up losing capital. A similar look at the long term shows that a single percentage point can make a very, very big difference. Let\u2019s say that you\u2019ve got $100,000 and you\u2019re earning an annual return of 5.5%. At the end of 30 years, assuming you have reinvested all of the money you make, thanks to the magic of compounding, you\u2019ll have about $500,000. But if your returns are only 4.5%, that sum will fall to $375,000. A single percentage point has cost you $125,000 over 30 years. A decline of two percentage points, and you\u2019ve lost nearly half of your total potential returns. McKinsey\u2019s message is that investors need to lower their expectations, work more years and double their savings. While many advisory firms don\u2019t find much to quibble about in McKinsey\u2019s conclusions, some aren\u2019t as willing to tell investors to simply give up. \u201cMcKinsey\u2019s take on lower returns is spot on, in our opinion,\u201d says a memo from New Jersey investment advisor RegentAtlantic. But it also argues there are parts of the market \u2013 such as the emerging markets, and smaller companies in those markets, in particular \u2013 that offer higher returns (and more risk). The report, however, merely articulates handwriting that\u2019s been on the wall for a while. But it does warn that it\u2019s going to be much, much more difficult for any of us to recover from any financial mistakes that we make. The markets aren\u2019t going to give us a helping hand. So when you read lists of financial tips such as starting to contribute to your 401k as soon as you can, don\u2019t see them as suggestions \u2013 they\u2019re commandments. If the market isn\u2019t going to help increase the amount you save, you\u2019ll have to do it, making every dollar you put aside more valuable \u2013 and the dollars you save in your 20s will always be vastly more valuable than those you invest in your 40s or 50s, thanks to compounding. Just do it. Similarly, watch out for some of the worst financial pitfalls you can make: dipping into that 401k, except in the direst of emergencies; racking up credit card debt and making only minimum payments; buying more houses than you can afford. Even paying for private schools from kindergarten through college, or helping to finance your child\u2019s wedding, can be a mistake if you\u2019re doing it at the expense of funding your own retirement needs. Yes, you are investing in your children\u2019s future (or the future health of the florist or wedding photographer\u2019s businesses), but how will they feel when, in 15 to 20 years\u2019 time, they realize that the price for that financial help is ongoing financial support? In a low-return environment, with investment tailwinds transformed into headwinds, those are some of the tough trade-offs that we\u2019ll have to wrestle with. Like it or not, it\u2019s time to prepare for the \u201cnew normal\u201d.",

      "bodyText": "Greece is running out of money. The government in Athens is raiding the budgets of the health service and public utilities to pay salaries and pensions. Without fresh financial support it will struggle to make a debt payment due in July. No, this is not a piece from the summer of 2015 reprinted by mistake. Greece, after a spell out of the limelight, is back. Another summer of threats, brinkmanship and all-night summits looms. The problem is a relatively simple one. Greece is bridling at the unrealistic demands of the European commission and the International Monetary Fund to agree to fresh austerity measures when, as the IMF itself accepts, hospitals are running out of syringes and buses don\u2019t run because of a lack of spare parts. Athens has already pushed through a package of austerity measures worth \u20ac5.4bn (\u00a34.23bn) as the price of receiving an \u20ac86bn bailout agreed at the culmination of last summer\u2019s protracted crisis and expected the deal to be finalised last October. Disbursements of the loan have been held up, however, because neither the commission or the IMF believe that Greece will make the promised savings. So they are demanding that Alexis Tsipras\u2019s government legislate for additional \u201ccontingency measures\u201d worth \u20ac3.6bn to be triggered in the event that Greece fails to meet its fiscal targets. This is almost inevitable, given that the target is for the country to run a primary budget surplus of 3.5% of gross domestic product by 2018 and in every year thereafter. This means that once Greece\u2019s debt payments are excluded, tax receipts have to exceed public spending by 3.5% of GDP. The exceptionally onerous terms are supposed to whittle away Greece\u2019s debt mountain, currently just shy of 200% of GDP. If this all sounds like Alice in Wonderland economics, then that\u2019s because it is. Greece is being set budgetary targets that the IMF knows are unrealistic and is being set up to fail. It will then be punished further for being unable to do what was impossible in the first place. Predictably enough, the government in Athens is not especially taken with this idea. It has described the idea as outlandish and unconstitutional, but is in a weak position because it desperately needs the bailout loan and threw away its only real bargaining chip last year by making it clear that it would stay in the single currency whatever the price. So Tsipras is doing what he did last year. He is playing for time, hopeful that by hanging tough and threatening another summer of chaos he can force Europe\u2019s leaders to offer him a better deal - less onerous deficit reduction measures coupled with a decent slug of debt relief. For the time being though, the matter is being handled by the eurozone\u2019s finance ministers, who want their full pound of flesh. The mood is especially unyielding in Germany, where Angela Merkel\u2019s popularity has suffered as a result of her open door policy toward refugees. Faced with growing hostility, she has concluded that this is not the time to show any signs of weakness. She has sought to mollify German voters by giving her finance minister, Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble, a free hand to ratchet up his criticism of the stimulus policies Mario Draghi is pursuing at the European Central Bank, and by insisting that there should be no debt relief for Greece until Tsipras has done everything demanded of him. Merkel must pray that the lid can be kept on Greece until after 23 June, because it is hard to see how a repeat of last summer\u2019s argy-bargy would help keep Britain inside the EU - rather more important to Germany in the long term than a few billion euros of debt relief. The reason is that David Cameron can only win his referendum by securing the votes of non-Conservative supporters, for some of whom the handling of Greece exemplifies everything that is wrong with the EU - its lack of democracy, hyper-conservative economic agenda and insistence that the single currency is a great success when in fact it has proved to be a colossal failure. Greece received the first of its three bailouts six years ago, when the terms were negotiated in the weekend following Britain\u2019s general election. Gordon Brown was on his way out, but the then chancellor Alistair Darling went to Brussels to discuss the deal with fellow EU finance ministers. Since then, there have changes of government in all the big EU countries bar Germany, and most of the smaller ones as well. Voters showed their unhappiness by getting rid of the centre-right in France and the centre-left in Spain. They waved goodbye to Silvio Berlusconi in Italy and Mark Rutte in the Netherlands. It has been all change at local level, but no change in Brussels and Frankfurt, where the officials responsible for the eurozone\u2019s bone-headed policies carry on regardless. Voters across Europe have got the message from the way Greece\u2019s opposition to austerity was crushed - you can vote for whoever you like, but it won\u2019t make any difference. The revolt against the status quo explains why Spain can\u2019t form a government, the two parties that have dominated Irish politics since independence could barely muster more than 50% of the vote in the recent election, the runoff for president in Austria is between the greens and the far right and Marine Le Pen has support in France. To be sure, this is not a phenomenon exclusive to the eurozone. There is marked hostility to the US political establishment, and it is clear that many voters in the UK simply do not believe the government\u2019s warnings about the economic risks of Brexit. The situation in the eurozone is worse, however, in part because the democratic deficit is so marked, in part because economic performance has been woeful and in part because there has been a dogged insistence on continuing with policies that have been both ineffective and unpopular. As Dan Atkinson and I argue in our forthcoming book about the failure of the single currency,* Greece was the point where progressive illusions were shattered. Until last summer it was just about possible to believe in a cuddly European polity dedicated to higher living standards, full employment and more generous welfare states. Then a gun was held to Greece\u2019s head. Tsipras was faced with a choice. Ignore what the people want or see your banks go bust. This in a country which had seen the economy shrink by a quarter in five years. Difficult to spot what was awfully progressive about sucking spending power from an economy woefully short of demand. Then or now. *Europe isn\u2019t working, by Larry Elliott and Dan Atkinson, Yale University Press",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Mike Ashley should send a bottle of bubbly to Sir Philip Green. The Sports Direct founder\u2019s attempt to dodge a grilling by MPs almost seems a sideshow when there are bigger fish to fry. Two select committees \u2013 work and pensions; and business, innovation and skills \u2013 want to hear from the BHS bogeyman and have invited him to a joint session on a day of his choosing in the next few weeks. Green, unlike Ashley, will be up for the fight, one suspects. He loves the spotlight, feels his arguments aren\u2019t being heard and may fear a consumer backlash against his Arcadia interests, notably Topshop. A refusal to attend would simply guarantee another verbal battering for a tycoon already branded the new \u201cunacceptable face of capitalism\u201d by one Tory MP. But a word of advice for committee members: please do not compete to see who can provoke Green to the greatest level of fury. That game may guarantee top billing on the News at Ten, but it is too easy to play. The BHS debacle requires forensic blow-by-blow questioning about the process by which Green extracted \u00a3580m in dividends, rent and interest payments from the business over the years, even as the deficit in the pension fund grew larger. We also need to know how he came to think a bunch of retailing amateurs led by a twice-bankrupt individual would be a suitable buyer of BHS, complete with those daunting pension liabilities. Here are a few questions to get the MPs started. BHS paid dividends of \u00a3423m between 2002 and 2004, but why did Green not divert some of that cash into a pension fund that was already heading into deficit towards the end of the period? What evidence can he provide that sale-and-leaseback property deals between BHS and the members of the Green family were conducted at arm\u2019s length and on commercial terms? Similarly, how were fees calculated when BHS bought services from the wider Arcadia group? In 2012, the company and the pension fund agreed to close the deficit in the pension fund over 23 years. Why was such a long period deemed sensible? How was Green introduced to Dominic Chappell, the former racing driver who headed the Retail Acquisitions consortium that bought BHS for \u00a31 in 2015? Why did Green regard him as a fit and proper owner? Why did he not seek approval from the Pensions Regulator for the transfer of the business? What discussions did he have with trustees of the BHS pension at that time? What contact did he have with Chappell\u2019s consortium after the sale? It has been reported that Green made an offer of \u00a380m \u2013 half in cash, half in the write-off of a loan \u2013 to top up the pension fund after the failure of BHS. Did he make that offer and, if so, why? What was the basis of the calculation? The MPs must do their homework because Green will have done his. Indeed, it might be wise to borrow a trick from Andrew Tyrie \u2013 the chairman of the Treasury select committee and a veteran in the art of cross-examining slippery bankers \u2013 and hire a QC to fire some detailed questions. Of course, the session should not be confined to gathering facts. There is a basic question of morality at stake: what responsibilities does Green feel towards 11,000 BHS staff and 20,000 pensioners? He owned the business for 15 years, and paid his wife fat dividends, yet sold BHS in an enfeebled state to a buyer lacking retail experience. Whatever the legality of his business manoeuvres, doesn\u2019t he feel a duty to ensure BHS pensioners get every last penny of what they expected in their retirement? If Green can\u2019t accept the moral case for writing a large cheque to close the \u00a3571m deficit, he will deserve every last drop of the MPs\u2019 \u2013 and the public\u2019s \u2013 scorn. It would be a shabby finale to a business career, but Green has a choice: does he want he seen as a decent man or as a shameless chancer? So Europe\u2019s not doing so badly after all\u2026 The eurozone economy was bubbling in the first three months of the year. Never since the 2008 crisis has it expanded by 0.6% in a single quarter \u2013 2.4% if extrapolated over the year. Such is the pace of growth that the 19-member bloc outstripped the UK and the US. UK growth was just 0.4% in the first three months, and statisticians in Washington said the US had flatlined. And this comes after GDP increased steadily for 18 months, putting a smile on the faces of tired eurocrats more accustomed to dealing with Greek debt or the refugee crisis. Even France was near the head of the pack. Its economy grew 0.5%, beating economists\u2019 expectations and boosting the fortunes of socialist president Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, who will stand for re-election next year. So much for Europe\u2019s reputation as a bombed-out economic has-been. And yet there was talk of a false dawn, in part because unemployment remains in double figures and inflation dropped from zero to -0.2%. And just as US figures for the early part of the year are often upgraded, the eurozone\u2019s are often later downgraded. Another barrier to a more sustained recovery is the slowdown in global growth recently documented by the IMF. Japan and China are struggling to maintain the export-driven growth that has served them so well, and Brazil and Russia are coping with recession. No wonder the Brussels elite want the UK to stay. They have avoided a crisis for almost two years and seen the benefits. Britain leaving would bring the EU\u2019s brief period of benign expansion to a halt and worse, if the many economists who predict gloom for Europe following a Brexit are to be believed. They fear is not just political instability, but a collapse in trade and investment akin to the 2008 crash. The OECD said last week that financial markets were already increasing the insurance premiums they charged to hedge against the worst possible outcomes, raising the costs of trade. Brussels knows how ugly family crises can get and wants to avoid another. Time is tight at RBS Running bailed-out Royal Bank of Scotland was never going to be an easy gig. But for Ross McEwan, at the helm since October 2013, it just got harder. On Friday, the market reacted badly to the idea that the bank will not be able to resume dividend payments until 2018 \u2013 a decade after shareholders last received a share of the spoils. The delay to payouts is one problem caused by the botched job of carving out the Williams &amp; Glyn network as demanded by Brussels at the time of the bailout. McEwan cannot be expected to take all the blame for what one analyst has rightly described as a farcical situation, but it is definitely his problem now. He has spoken vaguely of alternatives. Vagueness will not be tolerated for long. The City\u2019s patience is wearing thin and the European commission is unlikely to look kindly on an already extended deadline being missed.",

Whatever the legality of his business manoeuvres, doesn\u2019t he feel a duty to ensure BHS pensioners get every last penny of what they expected in their retirement?</p> <p>If Green can\u2019t accept the moral case for writing a large cheque to close the \u00a3571m deficit, he will deserve every last drop of the MPs\u2019 \u2013 and the public\u2019s \u2013 scorn. It would be a shabby finale to a business career, but Green has a choice: does he want he seen as a decent man or as a shameless chancer?</p> <h2>So Europe\u2019s not doing so badly after all\u2026</h2> <p>The eurozone economy was bubbling in the first three months of the year. Never since the 2008 crisis has <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/apr/29/eurozone-economy-grows-faster-than-expected-ecb\" title=\"\">it expanded by 0.6%</a> in a single quarter \u2013 2.4% if extrapolated over the year. Such is the pace of growth that the 19-member bloc outstripped the UK and the US. UK growth was just 0.4% in the first three months, and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/apr/28/sluggish-us-growth-global-economy\" title=\"\">statisticians in Washington said the US had flatlined</a>.</p> <p>And this comes after GDP increased steadily for 18 months, putting a smile on the faces of tired eurocrats more accustomed to dealing with Greek debt or the refugee crisis. Even France was near the head of the pack. Its economy grew 0.5%, beating economists\u2019 expectations and boosting the fortunes of socialist president Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, who will stand for re-election next year. So much for Europe\u2019s reputation as a bombed-out economic has-been.</p> <p>And yet there was talk of a false dawn, in part because unemployment remains in double figures and inflation dropped from zero to -0.2%. And just as US figures for the early part of the year are often upgraded, the eurozone\u2019s are often later downgraded.</p> <p>Another barrier to a more sustained recovery is the slowdown in global growth recently documented by the IMF. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/apr/28/bank-of-japan-shocks-markets-by-voting-against-more-stimulus\" title=\"\">Japan</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/apr/15/china-quarterly-gdp-growth-slows-but-signs-of-stability-emerge\" title=\"\">China</a> are struggling to maintain the export-driven growth that has served them so well, and Brazil and Russia are coping with recession. No wonder the Brussels elite want the UK to stay. They have avoided a crisis for almost two years and seen the benefits. Britain leaving would bring the EU\u2019s brief period of benign expansion to a halt and worse, if the many economists who predict gloom for Europe following a Brexit are to be believed.</p> <p>They fear is not just political instability, but a collapse in trade and investment akin to the 2008 crash. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/apr/27/brexit-cost-uk-households-2200-by-2020-eu-oecd\" title=\"\">The OECD said last week</a> that financial markets were already increasing the insurance premiums they charged to hedge against the worst possible outcomes, raising the costs of trade.</p> <p>Brussels knows how ugly family crises can get and wants to avoid another.</p> <h2>Time is tight at RBS</h2> <p>Running bailed-out Royal Bank of Scotland was never going to be an easy gig. But for Ross McEwan, at the helm since October 2013, it just got harder. On Friday, the market reacted badly to the idea that the bank will not be able to resume dividend payments until 2018 \u2013 a decade after shareholders last received a share of the spoils. The delay to payouts is one problem caused by the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/apr/28/rbs-admits-delays-offloading-williams-and-glyn\" title=\"\">botched job of carving out the Williams &amp; Glyn network</a> as demanded by Brussels at the time of the bailout.</p> <p>McEwan cannot be expected to take all the blame for what one analyst has rightly described as a farcical situation, but it is definitely his problem now. He has spoken vaguely of alternatives. Vagueness will not be tolerated for long. The City\u2019s patience is wearing thin and the European commission is unlikely to look kindly on an already extended deadline being missed.</p>",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Mike Coupe, the chief executive of Sainsbury\u2019s, is, by all accounts, a pretty decent guitarist. The regular Glastonbury-goer is handy enough with the instrument to have braved playing in front of 5,000 colleagues at several Sainsbury\u2019s conferences. One wonders if, when he tunes up at his next gig, he\u2019ll be playing a version of Can I Change My Mind?, the 1969 hit by Tyrone Davis (who may or may not be related to Coupe\u2019s predecessor but one, Sir Peter). That track might be considered appropriate for a man who, having previously argued against the supermarket buying Argos, went and put in a bid for it anyway, once he\u2019d taken over as the grocer\u2019s front man. We\u2019re sure to hear more about that deal this week when Sainsbury\u2019s announces its results, not least because the grocery sector\u2019s lyrics are beginning to repeat as much as those on a scratched bit of vinyl. The presence of the discounters still weighs heavily on the sector \u2013 even if the majors are under less pressure of late \u2013 while among the big four there are questions about what will happen to the seemingly recovering Morrisons (also reporting this week) if Asda decides to perform again. All of which means that talk about how the Argos deal might play out is far more likely to get the City on its feet. Take it from the top, Mike. Jenkins adds value The country has been deprived of the hypnotic oratory skills of former Barclays boss Antony Jenkins for far too long \u2013 but fret not. The great man returns to the podium this week. At a House of Commons event, run by the financial-services thinktank New City Agenda, Jenkins will revisit his favoured theme of \u201cturning values into value\u201d as he explains how the only way for the banking sector to generate sustainable returns over the long term is to act \u201cat all times with good values\u201d. \u201cIn the past, banks were too aggressive, too self-serving and too focused on the short term, and these events have led to trust in the industry sinking to an all-time low,\u201d the publicity material for the event bills him as saying \u2013 and it\u2019s hard to quibble with any of that. Still, before Jenkins was a crusading chief executive of Barclays, he had been in the driving seat of the high-street part of that bank as it merrily sold payment protection insurance (PPI) to people who never needed it or could have claimed on it. Strangely, that vignette seems to have been omitted from the publicity for this week\u2019s event. Space constraints, presumably. Glaxo still not immune Protests at GlaxoSmithKline\u2019s annual meeting in London\u2019s Queen Elizabeth II conference centre are nothing new \u2013 as anyone who owned shares during the tenure of former boss Jean-Pierre Garnier will recall. Campaigners used to gather to protest about how much JP was trousering. Investors had to squeeze past folk dressed in giant fat cat suits and others wearing T-shirts saying \u201cGreed Still Kills\u201d just to gain access to their free tea and biscuits. So maybe it\u2019s not news that there\u2019s a protest in the pipeline for Glaxo this week, when it holds its annual meeting in the usual spot, although the topic is probably more important. Shareholders are being urged to use the gathering to put pressure on Glaxo to lower the price of its life-saving pneumonia vaccines. M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res (MSF) has just delivered a petition to Glaxo (and another to rival Pfizer) asking that the vaccine prices be cut to $5 for each child in developing countries. Glaxo says it has lowered the price it charges Gavi, the non-profit vaccine alliance operating in a small number of countries, to $3.05 from next year, just covering its cost. But Greg Elder of MSF asks: \u201cWhat\u2019s the point of a life-saving vaccine if the most vulnerable people can\u2019t afford it?\u201d Developing...",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Ever since his first written evidence to the Treasury committee, the governor of the Bank of England, Mark Carney, has hinted that he understands the UK\u2019s real deficit problem. This is not the budget deficit, of which chancellor Osborne has made such a fetish, but the balance of payments deficit. Indeed, that distinguished former permanent secretary to the Treasury and cabinet secretary, Lord Turnbull, recently pointed out that debt owed to citizens of this country is not a problem \u2013 and that by not borrowing more for infrastructure at such low rates, Osborne is actually impoverishing future generations. He is, said Turnbull, \u201cplaying a dirty game\u201d. On the real deficit problem, it is obvious from his various pronouncements that Carney can, for a central bank governor, be quite relaxed about a fall \u2013 let us call it an \u201cadjustment\u201d \u2013 in the foreign exchange value of the currency if it is necessary to restore, or at least prevent a further deterioration, in Britain\u2019s competitiveness in international trade. Thus it emerged last week that the governor had written to Andrew Tyrie, the chairman of the Treasury committee, explaining that a 10% fall in the pound would boost economic growth by reducing the price of exports (or making exports more profitable) and encouraging companies and private individuals to buy more domestically manufactured goods. And the impact on inflation \u2013 which is already well below the official target \u2013 would hardly be sensational. But he distinguished between the effects of such a depreciation arising \u201cfor no underlying reason\u201d and a run on sterling that might result from a vote to leave the European Union \u2013 commonly known as \u201cBrexit\u201d. He explained: \u201cIf increased uncertainty were a key underlying cause of this depreciation, aggregate demand might be affected.\u201d Firms might postpone investment projects and households defer spending. Well, to judge from recent figures for gross domestic product in general and retail sales in particular, the economy may already be affected by concerns about the outcome of the referendum. These are deep waters, because our sensationally bad balance of payments position suggests that a major devaluation of the pound is needed anyway. I do not know whether Carney has read my good friend Sir Douglas Wass\u2019s magisterial work on the 1976 sterling crisis, Decline to Fall, but I assume he worries that a necessary devaluation could get completely out of hand \u2013 as happened in 1976, when the balance of payments position was not nearly as bad as it is now, although inflation certainly was. The Daily Telegraph columnist Roger Bootle, of Capital Economics, and the Labour donor John Mills recently produced a \u201cwork in progress\u201d pamphlet which argues that the kind of devaluation that might ensue from Brexit would be just what the economic doctor ordered anyway, whatever one\u2019s position on the Brexit debate. Bootle is deeply Eurosceptical, and Mills is of the Leave persuasion. Likewise, the economist Christopher Smallwood, who chaired a discussion of the pamphlet, thinks that for this reason a panic about Brexit could have unintended good consequences. All this comes with the proviso that the pound, unlike Hemingway\u2019s sun, does not also rise. For one of the problems with the fashion for a complete lack of exchange-rate management these days is that a necessary devaluation, as occurred in 2008-09, does not necessarily last. The result is that there is too much uncertainty for business to make long-term investment decisions. I seem to be one of the few who contend that the management of the world economy would benefit from international coordination to limit wild swings in the exchange rates that have such an influence on investment decisions. Indeed, when I wrote about this some years ago, I received a letter from that great former chairman of the Federal Reserve, Paul Volcker, saying that he and I appeared to be the only people in the world who approved of \u201ctarget zones\u201d for managing the gyrations of exchange rates. It is indeed unfortunate that, given our freedom from the fixed exchange-rate regime of the eurozone \u2013 one of the best British macroeconomic policy decisions of recent decades \u2013 our policymakers have made such a mess of exchange-rate management. Talking of which, I was much struck at a recent Llewellyn Consulting seminar by a presentation on Brexit from John Nug\u00e9e, who, when at the Bank of England, spent some time at the coal face of foreign exchange reserve management. Nug\u00e9e said we were in the world of \u201csurvival analysis\u201d, recalling that great Bank governor Eddie George\u2019s wise dictum: \u201cIt is never worth risking what you cannot afford to lose in order to win what you do not need to have.\u201d Personally, I think the calling of the referendum signified a colossal failure of leadership by David Cameron. It is suggested he was hoping that being in coalition with the Liberals would mean never having to follow through on his pledge. But because his promise to hold one saw off the threat from Ukip, it guaranteed the coalition would not be renewed in 2015 \u2013 and therefore meant he was still on the hook. And if he thought the referendum would heal the huge rift over Europe in the Conservative party, the inside view is that he has another think coming.",

It is suggested he was hoping that being in coalition with the Liberals would mean never having to follow through on his pledge. But because his promise to hold one saw off the threat from Ukip, it guaranteed the coalition would not be renewed in 2015 \u2013 and therefore meant he was still on the hook.</p> <p>And if he thought the referendum would heal the huge rift over Europe in the Conservative party, the inside view is that he has another think coming.</p>",
