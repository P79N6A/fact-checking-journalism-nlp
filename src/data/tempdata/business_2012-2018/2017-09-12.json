      "bodyText": "Homes across half of the UK are more affordable than before the financial crisis, with Birmingham, Glasgow and Leeds among the places where the gap between earnings and house prices has fallen, a study has found. Yorkshire Building Society research shows that with a continuing affordability crisis in London, popular destinations for people leaving the capital, such as Lewes and Exeter, have become increasingly affordable in the period since Northern Rock was bailed out 10 years ago. The findings, based on official earnings figures and Land Registry data for house prices in 356 local authority areas, come as the number of people departing London is at a five-year high, with net outward migration of 93,300 people in the year to June 2016, 80% higher than five years earlier. Andrew McPhillips, the chief economist at Yorkshire Building Society, said: \u201cAcross London and large swaths of southern England, which were already some of the most unaffordable parts of the country, it has become increasingly difficult for first-time buyers and those wanting to move up the housing ladder to be able to buy their first or next home. \u201cThe north of England, Wales and Scotland present a different picture entirely, with many places, such as Edinburgh, Peterborough and Birmingham, becoming more affordable than they were before the credit crunch. \u201cWhile some northern cities, such as Manchester, are less affordable than they were in 2007, in much of the north of England, Scotland and Wales, the gap between earnings and house prices is about one-third of the average for London.\u201d Separate figures from the property consultancy Savills show that the average house price in London rose from \u00a3286,000 in June 2007 to \u00a3482,000 in June 2017. During this period, they increased by \u00a38,000 in Yorkshire and fell by \u00a38,000 in the north-east. Lucian Cook, Savills\u2019 director of residential research, said: \u201cWe are at a high-water mark in terms of the differential. London is showing signs of slowing. \u201cThe differential is a risk to London\u2019s competitiveness in terms of its attractiveness to talent. Graduates will look at the other major employment centres and think their housing costs will be lower. They are less likely to start their career in London than in Bristol or Birmingham.\u201d According to Yorkshire Building Society\u2019s analysis, housing in Newcastle-upon-Tyne is 26% more affordable than a decade ago. Housing affordability has increased most dramatically in Inverclyde, North Ayrshire and West Dumbartonshire, while in the north of England, people living in Burnley, Hartlepool, Middlesbrough and Sunderland have seen the biggest gains in affordability. By contrast, the affordability of Rickmansworth in Hertfordshire has gone down more than anywhere else in the UK. Homes in the Three Rivers district council area, which is bisected by the M25, cost almost 16 times average earnings, compared with 10 times in 2007. The gap between the least and most affordable parts of Britain has almost doubled, and affordability in some local authorities has declined by up to 61%, while improving in others by up to 42%. Haringey, Westminster, Southwark, Waltham Forest and Hackney are the London boroughs where affordability has plummeted fastest over the decade, with homes becoming 50% less affordable.",

      "bodyText": "The UK\u2019s high street banks are an accident waiting to happen and could struggle in another financial crisis, according to a report published on Wednesday to mark the 10th anniversary of the run on Northern Rock. The report criticises the annual health checks \u2013 stress tests \u2013 that have been conducted by the Bank of England since the crisis and concludes that the methodology used by Threadneedle Street is flawed and the tests not gruelling enough. Queues started to form outside Northern Rock branches across the UK on 14 September 2007 after the BBC reported that the Newcastle-based lender had received emergency funding from the Bank of England. It was the first run on a high street bank in the UK since Overend &amp; Gurney in the 1860s and after attempts to find a buyer failed, the bank was nationalised in February 2008. Kevin Dowd, a professor of finance and economics at Durham University and a long-standing critic of the stress tests, said the Bank does not use the correct measures to assess the health of the banking system. Dowd is also a senior fellow at the Adam Smith Institute, a rightwing thinktank. His analysis \u2013 which the Bank of England has previously rejected \u2013 focuses on the health check of the major lenders published last November . Those tests were based on a number of hypothetical scenarios including house prices falling and the global economy contracting by 1.9%. Royal Bank of Scotland failed the test and Barclays and Standard Chartered would both have struggled to cope. Dowd argued that the scenarios were \u201chardly doomsday\u201d and disputes the way banks\u2019 capital strength is measured. \u201cThe stress tests are about as useful as a cancer test that cannot detect cancer. They seek to demonstrate a financial resilience on the part of UK banks that simply isn\u2019t there,\u201d said Dowd in the report. \u201cOur banking system is an accident waiting to happen.\u201d The Bank uses the value of assets as calculated by the banks rather than their value on the markets which, he argued, would give a more accurate assessment of their financial health. The leverage of banks has fallen by about a third since 2006 on the first measure but, according to Dowd, has increased by a half on the second. \u201cIt is disturbing that 10 years on from Northern Rock, the best measures of leverage \u2013 those based on market values \u2013 indicate that UK banks are even more leveraged than they were then,\u201d said Dowd. The Bank of England did not comment on the new report but the subject was the topic of a hearing of the Treasury select committee in January. Bank officials had said the amount of capital in the system in the crisis had been increased and defended the stress tests as being as tough as during the financial crisis. Some of Dowd\u2019s calculations included double counting, officials said. Dowd said he had met the Bank officials after that select committee meeting but did not disclose the details of their discussions.",

      "bodyText": "The Turnbull government\u2019s unwillingness to take rising inequality seriously means it is increasingly at odds with conservative global economic institutions like the International Monetary Fund, Australia\u2019s peak union body has warned. The Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU) has released a new report on rising inequality of wealth and income warning Australia is at risk of becoming an Americanised society of working poor if people are not given a pay rise. It is the union body\u2019s first paper on inequality since Sally McManus, the ACTU secretary, called on unionists three months ago to start campaigning hard on the issue, saying workplace rules needed to be repaired in Australia to reverse the damage to workers caused by three decades of neoliberalism. \u201cIt has taken the right 30 years of union bashing and neoliberalism to take us where we are now,\u201d McManus said in June. \u201cInequality is at a 70-year high. Wage growth hasn\u2019t been this low since records starting being kept.\u201d The ACTU paper, released on Wednesday, shows income inequality in Australia has been steadily rising in recent decades, \u201csince neoliberal approaches began to dominate economic policy in the 1980s\u201d. It says inequality in wealth has also been rising, and in recent years it has been occurring at a much faster pace. It says technological change has been one factor, but the trend of attacking the basic protections of workers has had a huge impact in Australia. It calls on the government to arrest the decades-old growth in inequality by rebuilding a \u201crelevant, modern and strong safety net\u201d for workers, restoring a fair and independent industrial umpire, and taking away incentives for employers to casualise work. It also calls on the government to dump its planned $65bn worth of corporate tax cuts, saying they will end up hurting workers because they will have to be funded by cuts to essential services. \u201cWe should reverse the cuts to penalty rates, raise the minimum wage, change our industrial relations laws and look at ways we can help support trade unions,\u201d the paper says. \u201cIndustrial laws have always existed with one primary purpose, that is to address the inherent power imbalance that exists between capital and labour. That imbalance has never been greater. Our laws need to change.\u201d On Tuesday, on the eve of the paper\u2019s release, McManus criticised the Turnbull government\u2019s new industrial relations proposals, saying they were an \u201cattack on democracy\u201d. The Coalition wants to amend the Registered Organisations Act to make it easier for union officials to be disqualified and for unions to be deregistered. McManus said instead of addressing inequality Malcolm Turnbull and his employment minister, Michaelia Cash, were obsessed with attacking unions. \u201cThere are two ways the Turnbull government can act to turn around inequality: make sure everyone pays their fair share of tax; and act so working people have strong enough rights at work to get decent pay rises and secure jobs,\u201d she said. \u201cBut instead the government is going in the opposite direction. Every day they think up new ways to hurt working people and weaken their rights while they are giving corporations $65bn in tax cuts. \u201cThese are the same failed policies that have caused inequality in the first place.\u201d The treasurer, Scott Morrison, recently dismissed the suggestion that income inequality had worsened in Australia in recent years, claiming inequality had \u201cactually got better\u201d, but was contradicted by economists. Philip Lowe, the Reserve Bank governor, argued in July that inequality had increased in Australia. \u201cWealth inequality has become more pronounced, particularly in the last five or six years, because there have been big gains in asset prices,\u201d he said. \u201cSo, the people who own assets, which tend to be wealthy people, have seen their wealth go up. \u201c[O]n income inequality, it\u2019s drifted up a little bit, but not very much. The movement in wealth inequality is a bit more pronounced because of the rise in asset prices.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The Murdochs, as the Labour MP Tom Watson gleefully noted, will be furious. In a one-dimensional fight at the Competition and Markets Authority over media plurality, the Murdoch clan would start as heavy favourites to get 21st Century Fox\u2019s bid for full control of Sky over the line. That is because the BBC and ITN, on most measures of audience reach, would still be bigger. An additional referral on grounds of broadcasting standards \u2013 which is what the culture secretary, Karen Bradley, now proposes \u2013 is a very different matter. The CMA wonks will be wading into unfamiliar waters. They will have to pull apart boardroom culture at Fox and consider the scope for the \u201cFoxification\u201d of Sky News \u2013 meaning the danger that the channel is turned into one that pumps out partisan drivel. It\u2019s hard to know which way the technocrats will jump when their usual spreadsheets offer no help. The plot has taken an unexpected turn. The stock market, making instant odds on the chances of the takeover ultimately happening, marked Sky\u2019s shares down, but by only 1.6% at the close of trading. How to read a share price of 937p? Well, it\u2019s 13% below Fox\u2019s proposed takeover price of \u00a310.75, which is a significant gap. But one doesn\u2019t know at what price a standalone Sky\u2019s shares would trade \u2013 they were 760p before the Murdochs made their move but revenue and profits have barely missed a beat since then. At a rough guess, the market is saying there is a 70% chance of the deal completing, not quite the slam dunk it looked a month ago. For Sky \u2013 and for the Murdochs \u2013 there are complications beyond the mere fact of a wider CMA inquiry. The time the process is taking will also infuriate them. Full CMA probes usually take six months minimum, and a study of corporate governance standards at Fox doesn\u2019t sound like a quick job. In the new year, Sky\u2019s board must decide how aggressive it wants to be in the next round of bidding for Premier League rights. That commercial puzzle may be trickier now. One popular theory in TV land holds that the Murdochs want the football at almost any price but Sky executives, mindful of other shareholders\u2019 worries, are less gung-ho. If that\u2019s true, who do the executives think they\u2019re working for? There\u2019s also the small matter of the \u00a3200m that Fox must pay Sky if the takeover doesn\u2019t happen by 15 August 2018. That date seemed an age away when the takeover proposal was made in December 2016 \u2013 less so now. Ed Miliband, chief lobbyist in getting Bradley to rethink the terms of her referral and reject Ofcom\u2019s advice, has played a blinder. He still may not succeed in getting the deal blocked, but there is now genuine uncertainty in the air. City behind the game on rate rise? Inflation has forced the government to lift the 1% annual cap on public sector pay from next year. That is a significant political event which makes one wonder if the City, which has breezily ignored warnings from various Bank of England policymakers about the need to raise interest rates soonish, is behind the game. Certainly there was a moment of self-doubt in the currency market as the consumer price index recorded 2.9% for August. The figure was only a tick or two above expectations but sterling hit a 12-month high against the dollar. It is, obviously, silly to read much into a single month\u2019s data. Even a few months\u2019 readings don\u2019t offer easy lessons. The CPI was 2.9% in May, 2.6% in June, 2.6% again in July and has now returned to 2.9%. Is that evidence of the stickiness of inflation? Or does it merely suggest that the effects of the post-referendum fall in sterling are taking time to wash through the system, especially in areas like clothing and footwear? Hard to say. For the time being, only votes at the Bank\u2019s monetary policy committee matter. Andy Haldane, its chief economist, is the main floating voter, given his recent remarks. If he switches sides and votes for an increase on Thursday, and if everyone else follows form, the majority for doing nothing would fall from 7-2 to 6-3. In itself, that wouldn\u2019t alarm investors. But a 3%-plus CPI figure next month \u2013 not impossible \u2013 would shake things up. The comforting idea that inflation will slowly fall as autumn arrives, and that a rate rise is a year away, is not nailed down yet. SuperGroup\u2019s new bonus scheme At last, some original thinking on bonuses. Julian Dunkerton and James Holder, co-founders of SuperGroup, the Superdry folk, are launching a share-based scheme that applies to all staff. It won\u2019t win any awards for closing the pay gap, it should be said. On the illustrative example, store staff would collect up to \u00a32,000 after three years, store managers \u00a328,000 and senior executives \u00a3300,000. Still, Dunkerton and Holder are funding the scheme out of their own projected gains if SuperGroup\u2019s share price improves and it won\u2019t cost other shareholders a penny. That is to their credit. One of these day, let\u2019s hope, a company will copy John Lewis\u2019s practice of awarding annual bonuses to all staff as a percentage of salary.

    "webTitle": "Murdochs' Sky takeover bid to be referred to competition watchdog", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The Murdochs face the biggest investigation into their record as media owners since the Leveson inquiry after the culture secretary said their proposed \u00a311.7bn takeover of Sky should face a further six-month inquiry. Karen Bradley surprised MPs by announcing that she was minded to refer 21st Century Fox\u2019s planned takeover of Sky to the Competition and Markets Authority on the grounds of their commitment to broadcasting standards, as well as on the expected grounds of media plurality. It means the Murdochs face an investigation not only into their media power in Britain but into their track record as broadcasters and publishers and their commitment to high editorial standards in both the UK and the US. Fox is controlled by Rupert Murdoch and his sons Lachlan and James. If the Fox bid is successful and it owns all of Sky then the satellite broadcaster will join the Sun, the Times and talkRadio in the Murdochs\u2019 wider British media empire, giving the family a bigger reach than any news provider apart from the BBC. It had been expected that Bradley would order an inquiry by the competition regulator on the grounds of media plurality. But the minister effectively overruled Ofcom, the media regulator, in also calling for a broadcasting standards investigation after misconduct allegations at Fox News in the US. Correspondence between Bradley and Ofcom revealed that the minister raised concerns about both a string of sexual harassment allegations at Fox News and claims that the broadcaster colluded with the White House on a discredited story that the murdered Democrat aide Seth Rich was the source of leaked emails. Bradley told parliament that the existence of \u201cnon-fanciful concerns\u201d about compliance procedures at Fox News and corporate governance at the Murdochs\u2019 companies meant the legal threshold for widening the investigation of the deal to broadcasting standards had been met. \u201cThe fact that Fox belatedly established such [compliance] procedures does not ease my concerns, nor does Fox\u2019s compliance history,\u201d Bradley said. \u201cThird parties also raised concerns about what they termed the \u2018Foxification\u2019 of Fox-owned news outlets internationally. On the evidence before me, I am not able to conclude that this raises non-fanciful concerns. \u201cHowever, I consider it important that entities which adopt controversial or partisan approaches to news and current affairs in other jurisdictions should, at the same time, have a genuine commitment to broadcasting standards here. These are matters the CMA may wish to consider in the event of a referral.\u201d Ofcom had said in a report published in June that the evidence available did not justify a broadcasting standards investigation and that Fox and Sky had a record of compliance in line with other major broadcasters. Shares in Sky closed down almost 2% after Bradley\u2019s announcement as concerns increased among investors about delays to the takeover and whether it would go ahead. There will be a 10-day consultation before Bradley makes her final decision. During this time, Sky and the Murdochs can make submissions to the government. An investigation into the Murdochs\u2019 commitment to broadcasting standards would be unprecedented for the CMA, which typically focuses on market share and consumer rights. Wilton Fry, a media analyst at Royal Bank of Canada, said: \u201cThe CMA is likely to look at the relationship between Fox, the Murdoch family and control of the organisation. We believe the issues raised \u2013 such as potential undue influence, corporate governance etc - should all be able to be resolved via either behavioral and/or structural remedies. \u201cThe real question in our mind, is where is the point of pain, at which point Fox would not be willing to accept the remedies - very tough remedies could include, for example, a prohibition on James Murdoch\u2019s executive powers given his prior relationship with News Corp at the time of the phone-hacking scandal.\u201d Fox said it was disappointed that Bradley had not followed the advice of Ofcom. \u201cAs the correspondence between DCMS and Ofcom makes clear, we do not believe that there are grounds for the secretary of state to change her previous position.\u201d However, Labour welcomed the prospect of an investigation on the grounds of broadcasting standards. Tom Watson, the deputy leader, said: \u201cI think it\u2019s the first time a minister in the current government has ever stood in the way of what the Murdochs want, and frankly not before time, so, well done,\u201d he said. \u201cAs they say in the Black Country, she\u2019s [Bradley] a good \u2018un.\u201d Ed Miliband, the former Labour leader, criticised Ofcom\u2019s handling of the Sky deal as well as comments made by the regulator in a letter to Bradley that recent complaints about Fox News \u2013 including programmes covering its Seth Rich story \u2013 were not a breach of the broadcasting code because the shows in question were not news programmes. \u201cOfcom is less alert about the danger of the Murdochs than the Conservative secretary of state,\u201d he said. \u201cThey are far too credulous and gullible about the Murdochs.\u201d Ofcom said: \u201cAs an independent regulator we act without fear or favour, free from political or commercial influence. We provided independent and evidence-based advice, and it is then right for the secretary of state to use her statutory discretion to reach a decision.\u201d Fox News has become increasingly troublesome for the Murdochs as they attempt to buy Sky and it was announced last month that it would no longer be broadcast in the UK for \u201ccommercial reasons\u201d. A sexual harassment scandal at Fox News has led to a string of high-profile figures leaving, including the chairman Roger Ailes, who has since died, and leading presenter Bill O\u2019Reilly. Critics of the Murdochs have also compared the Rich story with the News of the World hacking the phone of murdered schoolgirl Milly Dowler because of the distress it caused the victim\u2019s family. Fox News denies colluding with the White House on the story.",

We believe the issues raised \u2013 such as potential undue influence, corporate governance etc - should all be able to be resolved via either behavioral and/or structural remedies.</p> <p>\u201cThe real question in our mind, is where is the point of pain, at which point Fox would not be willing to accept the remedies - very tough remedies could include, for example, a prohibition on James Murdoch\u2019s executive powers given his prior relationship with News Corp at the time of the phone-hacking scandal.\u201d</p> <p>Fox said it was disappointed that Bradley had not followed the advice of Ofcom. \u201cAs the correspondence between DCMS and Ofcom makes clear, we do not believe that there are grounds for the secretary of state to change her previous position.\u201d</p> <p>However, Labour welcomed the prospect of an investigation on the grounds of broadcasting standards. <br></p> <p>Tom Watson, the deputy leader, said: \u201cI think it\u2019s the first time a minister in the current government has ever stood in the way of what the Murdochs want, and frankly not before time, so, well done,\u201d he said. \u201cAs they say in the Black Country, she\u2019s [Bradley] a good \u2018un.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/sep/01/britain-fox-news-murdochs-uk-media\">Britain doesn\u2019t need a Fox News.

The census report covers 2016, the last year of the Obama administration, and underlines the strength of the economic recovery he oversaw after the worst recession in living memory. The Census Bureau reported on Tuesday that the median household income was $59,000 in 2016, a rise of 3.2% from 2015\u2019s $56,500. In 2015, household incomes rose 5.2%, the largest increase since records began in 1967. The latest household income figure is the highest ever reported by the Census Bureau \u2013 eclipsing the peak of $58,665 reached in 1999. However, the Census Bureau warned against making direct comparisons because of changes in its methodology made in 2014. \u201cReal median household income has finally completed its nine-year slog of digging out of the ditch,\u201d said Chris Christopher, executive director of IHS Markit. The US poverty rate also fell to 12.7%, its lowest rate since 2007. Some 40.6 million Americans were living in poverty in 2016, down from 43.1 million in 2015. The percentage of Americans without health insurance also dropped in 2016, to 8.8% from 9.1% in 2015. There are just seven states that now have 12% or more of their population uninsured, down from 31 states in 2013, ahead of the introduction of Barack Obama\u2019s Affordable Care Act. Elise Gould, senior economist at the Economic Policy Institute (EPI), said there were many positive aspects to the report but \u201cwe should not be popping the champagne corks\u201d.\u201d According to the EPI\u2019s analysis of census data, the median income of non-elderly households is still well behind the peak reached in 2000 at $69,890, and she said it was \u201cproblematic\u201d that men\u2019s wages had stalled in 2016. \u201cI would say the report is sunny with a few clouds, if I had to use a metaphor,\u201d said Gould. \u201cBut it is very likely that if trends continue, we will get back to the levels where we were.\u201d",

    "webTitle": "JD Sports Fashion rides athleisure boom as sales rise by more than 40%", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Demand for sports-led womenswear continues to drive sales at JD Sports Fashion as the company shrugs off fears of a fashion meltdown on the high street. The retail group, which owns Blacks, Millets, Size and Go Outdoors as well as the JD Sports chain, reported a 33% rise in pre-tax profits to \u00a3102.7m in the six months to the end of July, as sales rose by 41% to \u00a31.37bn. Shares in the group closed up nearly 9%, taking its stock market value to \u00a33.3bn, more than \u00a31bn ahead of its rival and former shareholder Sports Direct, which suffered a 60% fall in profits in the year to the end of April. Analysts said JD Sports had beaten expectations in a tough market. The main sports chain achieved a 3% rise in sales at stores open more than a year in the six months to the end of July, despite tough comparisons against last year, when sales were helped by the Euro 2016 football championship and the booming athleisure market. Peter Cowgill, executive chairman of JD, said women\u2019s fashion and footwear sales continued to increase by double-digit percentages as young women sought out brands such as Ellesse, Pink Soda and Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s athleisure line Ivy Park, as well as the kind of sportswear meant to be worn outside the gym now pushed by the big brands Nike and Adidas. Cowgill said he did not see a slowdown in that market in the short term: \u201cI\u2019m pleased with trading. I see athleisure as being a culture not a trend. It\u2019s like saying: \u2018Do you think Adidas or Nike will decline?\u2019 I don\u2019t see it.\u201d The retailer was also helped by its outdoorwear division moving into profit for the first time, helped by the acquisition of the Go Outdoors chain last year. Cowgill said the group had done well with camping gear but it was difficult to attribute that directly to a trend towards staycations since the fall in the value of the pound. \u201cI\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s about staycations, but we have got better,\u201d he said.

    "webTitle": "Pound hits one-year high as UK inflation rate jumps to 2.9% - as it happened", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Right, time for a recap. The cost of living squeeze in Britain just became more uncomfortable, after inflation unexpectedly rose in August. The consumer prices index spiked to 2.9% in last month, from 2.6%, equalling May\u2019s four-year high. Shoppers suffered a big jump in clothing prices, particularly for womenswear, plus pricier petrol at the pumps. Economists blamed the weak pound, which has made imports pricier. Core inflation rose to 2.7%, its highest level since 2011, putting more pressure on the Bank of England to consider an interest rate hike. Speculation that the BoE could raise borrowing costs sent the pound soaring. It\u2019s currently trading at a one-year high against the US dollar, at $1.327, and a six-week high against the euro at \u20ac1.11. As this chat from the Bond Vigilantes team at M&amp;G shows, inflation is almost a whole percentage point over the BoE\u2019s 2% target. Unions have renewed their calls for the public sector pay cap to be abolished for all workers; otherwise staff such as nurses and teachers will continue to suffer a significant real wage cut. The jump in the pound pulled shares down in London (as it could hurt exporters). But other markets have continued to rally, sending global markets to their highest ever levels. Connor Campbell of SpreadEx says: The markets remained dominated by the reaction to the morning\u2019s UK inflation reading, with a bit of North Korea/Hurricane Irma relief thrown in for good measure. That relief has sent the MSCI All Country World Index to a new alltime high this afternoon. Here\u2019s our latest inflation news story: And that\u2019s all for today. Thanks for reading and commenting. GW Newsflash: Britain\u2019s next budget will be delivered on 22nd November. This will be chancellor Philip Hammond\u2019s opportunity to announce new tax and spending plans, perhaps tear up the public sector pay cap, and try to guide the economy through the Brexit process. It\u2019s worth noting, though, that police and prison staff only make up 6% of the total public sector work force. Plus, the pay increases announced today are unfunded, so savings or cuts must be made elsewhere to pay for them. Here\u2019s another depressing, and informative, chart from the Resolution Foundation, showing how public sector workers have suffered falling real wages for much of the last decade. In the last hour, the government has announced that the 1% pay cap will be lifted for the police and prison workers. They\u2019ll get pay rises of 2% and 1% respectively -- still not enough to keep up with inflation. Trade unions have already warned that it\u2019s not enough. Depressingly, the rise in UK inflation will fall particularly hard on poorer families. That\u2019s because they spend a greater proportion of their income on food, clothes and housing, where prices have risen above average this year. Stephen Clarke of the Resolution Foundation has tweeted the details: Important media news: Rupert Murdoch\u2019s attempt to take control of Sky has hit a potentially serious hurdle. Culture secretary Karen Bradley has just announced that she\u2019s \u2018minded\u2019 to refer the bid to the competition authorities on the grounds of broadcasting standards (basically, whether Fox is a fit owner). That\u2019s a new development; Bradley is also planning to refer the bid on the grounds of media plurality. Here\u2019s the full story: Sky\u2019s shares have fallen by almost 3%, to their lowest level since Murdoch made his bid last December, as traders digest this new development. Today\u2019s inflation figures will be high on the agenda when the Bank of England meets later this week to set interest rates. Last month, the MPC voted 6-2 to leave borrowing costs unchanged, with the majority judging that the economy was too weak to justify a hike. On Thursday, the committee will be up to full strength of nine policymakers as new deputy governor Dave Ramsden joins the throng. So could policymakers decide \u2018enough is enough!\u2019 and raise interest rates from their record low of 0.25%? City experts are divided on this issue. Emanuele Canegrati of BlackPearlFX argues that the BoE should use the levers of monetary policy to get inflation down to its 2% target, and ease the cost of living squeeze. Ben Lord of M&amp;G predicts that the Bank\u2019s chief economist, Andy Haldane, will vote for a rate hike on Thursday, resulting in a 6-3 split but no rate rise. Lord believes that the Bank should sit tight, as inflation may peak soon. \u201cIncreased disagreement on the MPC will likely lead to some sterling strength, in the short term at least... But if we are a month or so away from peak inflation, to hike rates and strengthen the pound....would be overly myopic and pro-cyclical in my view. Kathleen Brooks of City Index points out that the City believes there is a greater chance of a rate rise before Christmas. The Overnight Index Swaps market has already rushed to price in a greater probability of a rate hike from the BOE by year end. The market now expects a 30% chance of a hike in December, this compares with 20% a week ago. It\u2019s too late for most British holidaymakers, but the pound is rallying against the euro this morning, as well as the dollar, Sterling has gained 1% against the European single currency to \u20ac1.112, the highest level since the start of August. That means one euro is worth 89.9p, having hit 93p at the end of last month. We also have fresh evidence that the housing boom in Britain\u2019s capital is faltering. London house prices rose by just 2.8% in the 12 months to July 2017, much slower than the national average of 5.1%. Indeed, that makes the London the slowest region in England. London continues to be the region with the highest average house price at \u00a3489,000, followed by the South East, at \u00a3321,000, and the East of England, at \u00a3290,000 respectively. Public sector workers will see their real wages shrink by around 2% this year, unless the pay cap is dropped. Liberal Democrat leader Vince Cable says Theresa May\u2019s government needs to act urgently: \u201cRising inflation shows how urgent it is to address the sense of unfairness around the pay cap. \u201cWith these numbers our nurses, teachers and other public sector workers will experience a 2% pay cut in the coming year. This will only aggravate the recruitment and retention crisis we are facing. \u201cThe government must take urgent steps to lift the pay cap for all public sector workers, and increase wages in line with inflation.\u201d Andrew Sentance of PwC (and a former Bank of England interest-rate setter) fears that inflation will keep rising as the full impact of the weak pound ripples through the economy. He predicts that the consumer prices index will rise over 3% later this year, weakening growth. With very well-developed and complex supply chains, it can take a number of years for a decline in the exchange rate, which raises import prices, to feed through fully to consumers. \u201cThis suggests that the recent squeeze on consumer spending from higher inflation will continue to dampen growth in the UK economy in the second half of this year and next year. There is not much sign yet that consumers will get any early relief from the surge in inflation following the Brexit vote last summer.\u201d The pound has now clawed back half of the losses suffered after the Brexit vote, but is still worth 10% less than in June 2016. Britain is now suffering its SECOND cost of living squeeze in a decade. As thus chart shows, inflation (in pink) outpaced wage growth once the financial crisis began in 2008. Real wages didn\u2019t turn positive until 2014, but have been shrinking since early 2017. The Treasury have sent a comment over, but it doesn\u2019t reveal whether the public sector pay cap is being axed.... \u2018We know some families have concerns with their day to day cost of living. That\u2019s why we are boosting take home pay with tax cuts for over 30 million people and a National Living Wage that is giving the lowest earners their fastest pay rise for 20 years.\u2019 Ranko Berich, Head of Market Analysis at Monex Europe, says Britain\u2019s inflation rate has \u201csmashed expectations\u201d, which is why the pound spiked to one-year high. He fears that it will hurt consumer spending in the coming months (which will be bad for growth). Berich adds: \u201cThe breadth of today\u2019s inflation surprise is striking. All of the headline price indices, including Core CPI, PPI and RPI printed higher than median forecasts. The record 4.6% increase in clothing and footwear indicates that retailers are passing cost increases straight to consumers. On the whole, today\u2019s figures highlight just how hard inflation is continuing to bite into real wages, although it will be interesting to see how nominal wages perform in tomorrow\u2019s labour market data. As real wages fall, consumer spending is likely to come under further pressure this year, after a wobble in the first quarter. City economists are concerned to see that Britain\u2019s \u2018core\u2019 inflation rate has hit a six-year high, at 2.7%. Core inflation strips out volatile factors like petrol and food, and is meant to give a better picture of economic pressures. Andreas Wallstr\u00f6m of Nordea Markets predicts that this makes an early interest rate rise more likely. Economist Rupert Seggins agrees that the Bank of England\u2019s Monetary Policy Committee will be concerned. He\u2019s tweeted a chart, showing how core inflation typically lags behind the exchange rate by about two years. If that relationship holds, the Brexit impact hasn\u2019t arrived yet.... Edward Hardy, economist at currency firm WorldFirst, blames bad weather and geopolitical worries for driving inflation up. Hardy says: \u201cPetrol prices have come back to bite: after two months of stagnant energy costs, weather disruption in the Gulf of Mexico twinned with geopolitical tensions on the Korean peninsula have lit a fire under commodity prices . The recent recovery in the eurozone is also a factor. The euro hit an eight-year high against the pound in August, which makes imports from Europe more expensive. Britain\u2019s inflation rate has been driven up by the slump in the pound in the summer of 2016, after the Brexit vote. Ben Brettell, senior economist at Hargreaves Lansdown, suspects that UK inflation may now be peaking. The public will hope he\u2019s right, as wages are certainly not keeping pace with the cost of living. Brettell says: Inflation ticked up again in August, with increased petrol and diesel prices contributing to a year-on-year figure of 2.9%, up from 2.6% in July and matching May\u2019s four-year high. This will inevitably raise questions about the UK\u2019s ongoing cost of living squeeze. Data released tomorrow is expected to show pay increasing at 2.2% in the three months to July, meaning wages are still shrinking in real terms. Yet it looks likely that inflation will fall back in the coming months, as the effect of Brexit-induced sterling weakness falls out of the year-on-year calculation. Trade unions say the UK government must now drop its pay cap on public sector workers, to give them more protection against inflation. TUC General Secretary Frances O\u2019Grady says: \u201cThe cost of living squeeze continues, with rising inflation outpacing wages. \u201cThe government needs to get a grip and get pay rising across the economy. A good start would be to scrap the pay cap for all public sector workers. There is speculation that Theresa May\u2019s government is preparing to lift the cap, for police officers and prison workers. That\u2019s not enough, though, O\u2019Grady warns: \u201cOur dedicated public servants are a team. A pick and mix approach, that rewards some and not others, would be cynical and plain unfair.\u201d Boom! The pound has hit a one-year high against the US dollar, following the spike in the cost of living. Sterling has gained a whole cent against the dollar to hit $1.3280, the strongest level since mid-September 2016. Traders are calculating that August\u2019s inflation surge means the Bank of England is more likely to raise interest rates soon. On an annual basis, clothing and footwear inflation in Britain has hit 4.6%. That\u2019s the highest level since the last days of the Thatcher administration, according to City economist Simon French of Panmure Gordon. Buying clothes became rather pricier last month.... Clothing and travel costs drove the cost of living up in August. Average clothing prices jumped by 2.4% between July and August 2017, with women\u2019s clothing becoming particularly pricier. Fuel costs also rose -- with petrol prices jumping by 1.8 pence per litre. Air fares rose as usual between July and August, by 10.9% (because it is peak holiday time...) This chart shows how the consumer prices index (in yellow) has risen sharply over the last year - back to levels seen in May this year, and in June 2013. BREAKING: Britain\u2019s inflation rate has jumped to 2.9% in August, from 2.6% in July. That equals the four-year high struck in May this year. It means British households are still facing a cost of living squeeze, as wages are currently rising by around 2.1%. More to follow! The pound just hit a four-week against the euro, at 90.605p..... Economist Marc Br\u00fctsch of Swiss Life predicts that UK inflation spiked to 2.9% in August, from 2.6% in July. Royal Bank of Scotland predict that the Consumer Prices Index rose by 2.8%, but will spike over 3% this autumn. Just 15 minutes to wait.... Expectations that Britain\u2019s inflation rate rose in August are pushing sterling higher this morning. The pound is up almost half a cent at $1.321 against the US dollar. A high inflation reading puts more pressure on the Bank of England to raise interest rates from the record lows (making it more lucrative to hold money in pounds). It says something about the financial markets that shares can rally on the back of a devastating storm that was only slightly less awful than feared. But what? Analysts at ING told clients this morning that investors are remarkably relaxed: \u201cWhether that equity reaction is Panglossian complacency or a sign of wonderful underlying fundamentals remains open to question. Even Category 5 storms can now be added to the list of things that \u2019Don\u2019t Really Matter\u2019. If in doubt, blame the media..... European stock markets are pushing higher in early trading, as the momentum from Wall Street\u2019s rally ripples back to the City. Naeem Aslam of Think Markets says traders have regained their appetite for riskier assets. Investors are surely feeling less concerned about the potential hurricane damage cost. This has brought back the traditional risk on trade. The new (and watered down) sanctions on North Korea agreed by the United Nations last night are also boosting the markets today, says Matt Simpson, senior market analyst at Faraday Research. World stock markets are at record highs this morning, thanks to relief that the economic cost of hurricane Irma will probably be lower than feared. Last night, America\u2019s S&amp;P 500 index finished at its highest ever level, with insurance firms surging. Asian stocks have hit a 10-year high today, and European markets are also up in early trading. This has driven the MSCI All Country World Index - a broad measure of stocks around the globe - up to a new alltime peak of 484.12 points. Overnight, most powerful storm in Atlantic history has been downgraded to a tropical depression after causing terrible damage in the Caribbean, and in the Florida Keys region. The repair bill will run into many tens of billions, but is likely to miss the worst-case estimates - because Irma changed course and didn\u2019t strike a direct hit on the cities of Miama and Tampa. That\u2019s a relief for the insurance industry, who were looking at a \u00a3150bn bill for Irma at one stage. But traders should remember that 10 fatalities have been reported in the US, and another 37 in the Caribbean. Irma has still been a monster. US officials are warning of a possible humanitarian crisis unless power and water can be restored, and the clean-up job will be huge. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial market, the eurozone and business. Britain\u2019s cost of living crisis will rear up again this morning, when new inflation figures are released. Economists predict that inflation jumped to around 2.8% per year in August, up from 2.6% in July. That\u2019s close to the four-year high of 2.9% which the consumer prices index struck in May. If so, that would mean that the average Briton\u2019s real pay is falling. Earnings only rose by 2.1% in the three months to June (we get new figures tomorrow), meaning inflation is more than eroding any wage increases. That\u2019s a particular blow for nurses, doctors and other public sector workers, thanks to the government\u2019s 1% pay cap. The weak pound is driving inflation higher, by making imports more expensive. Higher fuel prices are also pushing the cost of living up, according to James Brown of consultancy firm Simon-Kucher: \u201cFor road users, petrol prices are up after the respite given by lower prices over the summer. \u201cDriving to work cost 5% more in August and early September than last year.\u201d Separate house price figures will show how Britain\u2019s housing sector performed in July. It\u2019s a big day for the car industry too, as the Frankfurt Motor Show kicks off. We\u2019ll also be watching for comments from the Bank of England\u2019s markets director, and the vice-president of the ECB: The agenda: All day: The Frankfurt Motor Show 9.30am BST: UK inflation for August 9.30am BST: UK house price figures for July 10.20am BST: Bank of England markets director Chris Salmon speaks in Barcelona 3.45pm BST: European Central Bank vice-president V\u00edtor Const\u00e2ncio speaks in Frankfurt",

      "bodyText": "The squeeze on Britain\u2019s living standards worsened last month after the increased cost of importing fuel, clothes and food pushed inflation back up to 2.9%, from 2.6% in July. Women\u2019s clothes were among the items to jump in price in August as the low value of the pound earlier this year pushed up the prices in sectors heavily dependent on imported goods. Labour and the Liberal Democrats said the spike in prices, equalling a four-year high in the consumer price index (CPI) reached in May this year, put pressure on Theresa May to immediately scrap the 1% pay cap for all public sector workers. May\u2019s government announced on Tuesday that it will give police officers a 2% pay rise and prison staff 1.7% this year, and lift the 1% cap for all public sector pay from next year. Liberal Democrat leader Vince Cable said a newly qualified nurse faced a real-terms pay cut of \u00a3412 this year under the cap with inflation at around 3%, while newly qualified teachers face a \u00a3435 shortfall. \u201cRising inflation shows how urgent it is to address the sense of unfairness around the pay cap,\u201d he said. \u201cWith these numbers our nurses, teachers and other public sector workers will experience a 2% pay cut in the coming year. This will only aggravate the recruitment and retention crisis we are facing.\u201d Speaking from the TUC\u2019s annual conference in Liverpool, its general secretary, Frances O\u2019Grady, said: \u201cThe government needs to get a grip and get pay rising across the economy. A good start would be to scrap the pay cap for all public sector workers.\u201d The latest pay figures are due on Wednesday and will be keenly watched after three months of rising wage growth to an annual rate of 2.1% in June. The Bank of England will give its verdict on the economy on Thursday, when it will judge how much the pay squeeze from below inflation wage rises is having on GDP growth. In its most recent state-of-the-nation report, Threadneedle Street\u2019s monetary policy committee (MPC) said it expected inflation to plateau at around 3% before falling back while wages were forecast to maintain their current upward trajectory, possibly bringing to an end the recent fall in real incomes by the end of the year. But the central bank could come under pressure to bring inflation down more quickly, leading some City traders to speculate that the MPC may be forced to raise interest rates sooner than forecast. An average of City analysts targets next August for the first rise in what by then would be 11 years. The expectation of an early rate rise pushed the pound to its highest level for a year against the dollar. Sterling rose by just over a cent to hit $1.327 just after the figures were released. The pound was expected to remain at elevated levels until the central bank\u2019s interest rate policy becomes clearer. Howard Archer, chief economic adviser at the EY Item Club, said: \u201cSterling\u2019s past sharp drop should have now largely fed through the pricing chain. Meanwhile, ongoing muted earning growth and lacklustre economic activity should limit domestic inflationary price pressures. Additionally, oil prices remain relatively muted. \u201cConsequently, we believe there is a strong chance that consumer price inflation will be back to 2% by the end of 2018.\u201d The Office for National Statistics said much of the rise in inflation cold be attributed to the increasing cost of imports. Imports have risen steeply in price after the collapse in the pound following the Brexit vote, though the rising cost has taken longer to filter through to the high street than many analysts believed. Clothing and footwear, most of which is imported, jumped in price by 4.6% year on year after a sharp rise in the price of women\u2019s clothing pushed the average price up by 2.4% between July and August. Fuel costs also rose with petrol prices jumping by 1.8 pence per litre. The Resolution Foundation said that with the poorest fifth of households spending almost twice as much of their income on food and clothing as the richest fifth of households, its analysis shows that lower income families are seeing the fastest inflation increases. Stephen Clarke, policy analyst at the thinktank, said: \u201cThe return of rising inflation after a two month pause will put further pressure on already stretched household budgets. \u201cThis time last year the falling cost of food and clothing provided crucial relief for low income families in particular. But the rising cost of imports has meant that they are now a leading driver of the rise in prices. \u201cAs a result, lower income households are now feeling the biggest living standards squeeze from rising inflation. This is particularly true of those low and middle income working families who are experiencing the combination of shrinking pay packets and the effects of their tax credits and universal credit being frozen in cash terms,\u201d he said.",

Additionally, oil prices remain relatively muted.<br></p> \n<p>\u201cConsequently, we believe there is a strong chance that consumer price inflation will be back to 2% by the end of 2018.\u201d<br></p> \n<p>The Office for National Statistics said much of the rise in inflation cold be attributed to the increasing cost of imports.</p> \n<p>Imports have risen steeply in price after the collapse in the pound following the Brexit vote, though the rising cost has taken longer to filter through to the high street than many analysts believed.<br></p> \n<p>Clothing and footwear, most of which is imported, jumped in price by 4.6% year on year after a sharp rise in the price of women\u2019s clothing pushed the average price up by 2.4% between July and August.

But the rising cost of imports has meant that they are now a leading driver of the rise in prices.<br></p> \n<p>\u201cAs a result, lower income households are now feeling the biggest living standards squeeze from rising inflation. This is particularly true of those low and middle income working families who are experiencing the combination of shrinking pay packets and the effects of their tax credits and universal credit being frozen in cash terms,\u201d he said.<br></p> \n<p><br></p>",

      "bodyText": "The financial regulator has issued a stern warning against a speculative frenzy over initial coin offerings (ICOs) in cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin that have been promoted by celebrities including Paris Hilton. The Financial Conduct Authority said anyone investing in ICOs should be prepared to lose all their money, with some of the schemes floated potentially outright frauds. ICOs use the language of conventional initial public offerings (IPOs) and are designed to raise money for internet-based startups. But their similarities with IPOs end there. Instead of raising funds from the public in sterling, euros or dollars, investors in ICOs pay in cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin and ether. In return, they are issued with a \u201ccoin\u201d or \u201ctoken\u201d that is in effect their share in the firm. ICOs have become popular enough for celebrities including Hilton and Floyd Mayweather to jump on board. Last week the hotel heiress tweeted her 16 million followers that she was investing in something called LydianCoin that aimed to raise $100m (\u00a375m). In recent months it is believed as much as \u00a31bn may have poured into ICOs, with China the centre of speculative activity. But following a crackdown by regulators around the world, bitcoin values have slumped, with the price plummeting from $4,950 at the start of September to below $4,300, although it remains substantially up on the year. \u201cICOs are very high-risk, speculative investments,\u201d said the FCA. \u201cYou should be conscious of the risks involved \u2026 and prepared to lose your entire stake.\u201d In a long list of warnings, the regulator said ICOs were almost completely unregulated, offered no investor protection, were subject to extreme price volatility, and had the potential for fraud. It added that the prospectuses for ICOs, often called white papers, \u201cmight be unbalanced, incomplete or misleading\u201d. The FCA\u2019s warning follows similar action by regulators around the world. Last week the People\u2019s Bank of China banned ICO fundraising and the launch of digital currencies, saying the practice constituted illegal fundraising. ICO trading has been most frenzied in Beijing and Shanghai, with 65 ICOs launched during the year, raising about \u00a3300m from 105,000 investors, according to the state-run news agency Xinhua. Investors in ICOs make money when the value of their coins goes up, and following the huge gains in bitcoin \u2013 up sixfold since January despite recent falls \u2013 and another cryptocurrency, called ethereum (which has gone from $12 to $308), a lot of investors have been prepared to speculate. Ethereum itself was launched with a sale that netted 31,591 bitcoin (then around $18.5m) in exchange for its first 60m ether tokens. It was followed by at least 10 other ICOs run on ethereum alone, including the Basic Attention Token used for tracking-free advertising on the Brave adblocking browser ($35m raised), the MobileGo token used in a cryptocurrency-based video game marketplace ($26m raised), and the Bancor Network Token, which backs a platform designed to make it easier for users to make and launch their own blockchain tokens ($152.3m raised). The most notorious failure to date has been a startup called the Decentralised Autonomous Organisation \u2013 DAO \u2013 which sold itself as a crowdsourced hedge fund. It lost about $150m of investors\u2019 money, after a vulnerability in the code was discovered which allowed funds to be siphoned off by an anonymous attacker.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The deputy prime minister, Barnaby Joyce, has pulled back from a comment he made to the Coalition party room on Tuesday that AGL was \u201cshorting\u201d the market by refusing to sell the ageing Liddell coal-fired power plant to a competitor. Joyce would not repeat the accusation during an interview on Sky News late on Tuesday \u2013 but he insisted the company had not provided a reasonable answer to the question of why it would decommission the New South Wales plant if a rival generation company wanted to buy it. \u201cWhy pull a plant to pieces if there are people out there who want to buy it,\u201d the deputy prime minister said \u2013 adding that he knew two interested parties who were serious buyers. The negative public commentary about AGL\u2019s market behaviour was echoed by the chairman of the Coalition\u2019s backbench committee on energy, Craig Kelly, who said he intended to call the chairman of the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, Rod Sims, to ask for an investigation. \u201cThere\u2019s an arguable case that AGL are acting in an anti-competitive manner, and I will be calling on the ACCC to investigate,\u201d Kelly told Guardian Australia. The ACCC has expressed public concern about market concentration in power generation and retailing, and is currently inquiring into energy affordability, with an initial report expected late this month. Energy industry players argue power prices are a function of tight gas supply and coal capacity leaving the system, not market manipulation and anti-competitive behaviour. The focus by government MPs on AGL\u2019s market behaviour are part of the Turnbull government\u2019s continuing efforts to strongarm the energy retailer into either selling Liddell, or extending its operating life for another five years \u2013 pressure the company is attempting to resist. The company has agreed to give the Turnbull government a plan within 90 days detailing how it will supply the electricity market with reliable power when Liddell is retired in 2022. The public commitment came after a meeting between the AGL chief executive, Andy Vesey, the prime minister, and senior government ministers, in Canberra on Monday, where the company was asked to take a proposal to the board to either sell the plant, or keep it open for another five years. AGL has agreed reluctantly to take that proposal to the board, as well as its own plant to replace Liddell\u2019s current generation capacity with peaking gas and renewables. Energy policy continued to dominate political debate in Canberra on Tuesday, with roiling contention inside the parliament and continued internal ructions inside the Coalition. The former prime minister Tony Abbott, who is an opponent of the clean energy target recommended by Australia\u2019s chief scientist Alan Finkel, told the Coalition party room the government needed to keep its focus on keeping energy affordable. Abbott told colleagues if the government was to add Finkel\u2019s proposed clean energy target to the existing renewable energy target, which peaks in 2020, but tapers out to 2030, that would be a \u201cdifficult position to sustain\u201d. The proposed clean energy target remains alive, but will not emerge from the current policy development process in the form Finkel modelled during his inquiry. The government is making it clear the new investment framework, which it wants to resolve before the summer parliamentary recess, will need to be geared to reliability and affordability as well as to emissions reduction. Government players are now talking in more generic terms about an investment mechanism or framework that will deal with a range of issues, while ensuring Australia is on track to meet the Paris climate target. With some Nationals MPs are flat-out opposed to the clean energy target, Joyce said on Tuesday the policy was something that needed to be \u201cnegotiated\u201d both inside the government, and between the Liberals and the Nationals. He has previously signalled he would support a clean energy target with a threshold set high enough to allow coal generators to get certificates. The deputy prime minister said the government would need to \u201cland on a target that keeps our base-load power in play\u201d.",

Coalition party room the government needed to keep its focus on keeping energy affordable.<br></p> <p>Abbott told colleagues if the government was to add Finkel\u2019s proposed clean energy target to the existing renewable energy target, which peaks in 2020, but tapers out to 2030, that would be a \u201cdifficult position to sustain\u201d.</p> <p>The proposed clean energy target remains alive, but will not emerge from the current policy development process in the form Finkel modelled during his inquiry.</p> <p>The government is making it clear the new investment framework, which it wants to

      "bodyText": "Theresa May has raised concerns with Donald Trump about a trade dispute that threatens thousands of jobs in Northern Ireland amid pressure from the Democratic Unionist party. Sources confirmed that the prime minister spoke to the US president and expressed her concerns that more than 5,000 jobs in Belfast could be put in jeopardy if Boeing won its case against rival plane maker Bombardier. The DUP confirmed it had spoken to the cabinet in London about the threat. The party, whose 10 MPs have struck a deal to support May, asked for a senior minister to speak to the US government about Boeing\u2019s case over Canadian firm Bombardier winning a contract to supply new planes to Delta Air Lines. Boeing has complained to the authorities in the US that the deal enabling Bombardier to build 125 C-Series passenger jets for Delta was unfairly subsidised by a Canadian state. The wings for the C-Series planes are made at Bombardier\u2019s plant in east Belfast. The US Department of Commerce is due to make a ruling on Boeing\u2019s complaint this month and it could result in Bombardier having to pay punitive tariffs. Trade unions representing workers at the Bombardier factory are understood to have been briefed by the Canadian aerospace company about the potential implications of the court case. Responding to reports that May had intervened in the dispute, the DUP MP Sir Jeffrey Donaldson said the party was aware of the potential threat to jobs at one of Northern Ireland\u2019s biggest employers. \u201cWe have raised the issue at ministerial level,\u201d the Lagan Valley MP told the Guardian on Monday night. On reports that the prime minister spoke to Trump about the issue, Donaldson said: \u201cWe would be keen that she does intervene because it\u2019s 5,000 jobs in Belfast which are at risk. \u201cWe are aware that she was involved at looking at the issue. And we would welcome it if she was talking to President Trump because Bombardier is a huge investor in Northern Ireland. We are very concerned at the current situation. Any intervention by her would be extremely welcome.\u201d Boeing has objected to Bombardier\u2019s deal with Delta, which the American plane maker claims was bolstered by a $1bn (\u00a3750m) investment bailout from the Quebec provincial government in Canada. Seattle-based Boeing accuses its rival of receiving state aid to \u201caggressively target the US market\u201d. Bombardier has dismissed the allegations as \u201cabsurd\u201d and insisted the injection of cash complies with laws and regulations in the jurisdictions where it does business. Based at the old Shorts plane factory near George Best airport, the Bombardier plant employs about 5,500 people and is worth 10% of Northern Ireland\u2019s overall manufacturing exports. Its C-Series wing factory \u2013 Northern Ireland\u2019s biggest inward investment project \u2013 was helped with a \u00a3120m loan from both the UK government and the devolved Stormont power-sharing administration. In terms of wages, Bombardier\u2019s presence generates about \u00a3183m for the local economy every year.",
