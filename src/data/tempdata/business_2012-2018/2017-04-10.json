      "bodyText": "Britain\u2019s retailers suffered a third consecutive month of falling sales in March, according to industry figures that add to evidence that a post-referendum rise in living costs is denting consumer spending. In advance of official inflation figures on Tuesday, expected to confirm sharper price rises in the shops, the British Retail Consortium (BRC) said takings were down 1% compared with March last year. Its monthly snapshot showed that a dip in demand for clothing, toys and household appliances contributed to the biggest fall in like-for-like sales for a year and a half. But the BRC cautioned that the latest figures were distorted by the timing of Easter, which falls in April this year but was in March in 2016. However, the lobby group said a slowdown in non-food sales was persisting and the underlying trend for that part of the market was the weakest for almost six years. The figures follow official data from the Office for National Statistics showing retail sales fell in December and January but recovered slightly in February. Retailers face the dual pressures of cautious consumers and rising operating costs this year. Their labour costs have risen with an increase in the national living wage, transport costs are up on higher oil prices and imported goods are more expensive because of the pound\u2019s sharp fall since the Brexit vote last June. Paul Martin, the UK head of retail at the report\u2019s co-authors KPMG, described the sales drop in March as a disappointing end to the first quarter for retailers. \u201cEaster being later in the year is likely to have contributed to the bleaker picture, alongside the other obstacles facing the sector \u2013 especially increased input costs,\u201d he said. \u201cFood sales remained in the black for a full quarter, although this is largely being driven by rising inflation, so no reason for too much celebration. Women\u2019s footwear certainly stepped up, encouraged by the arrival of spring collections. Meanwhile, the rise in jewellery and beauty products is likely to have been helped by Mother\u2019s Day.\u201d Over the three months to March, food sales decreased 0.2% on a like-for-like basis but increased 1.2% on a total basis, which does not adjust for the effect of store openings. \u201cThis marginal growth in food was bolstered by slightly higher shop prices following increases in global food commodity costs and a weaker pound,\u201d said the BRC\u2019s chief executive, Helen Dickinson. Economists have forecast that people will be left with less cash to spare for discretionary spending this year because they are having to spend more on essentials such as food, household bills and fuel as prices rise. Meanwhile, wage growth is widely expected to slow, leaving people worse off in real terms. As a result, the Bank of England and other forecasters expect weaker consumer spending to drag on economic growth this year. Inflation figures for March, due on Tuesday morning, are expected to show the measure of price rises held at 2.3%, its highest for more than three years, according to a Reuters poll of economists. But some predict inflation possibly eased thanks to softer petrol prices and the later timing of Easter holidays making airfares lower than in March 2016. A separate report on Tuesday from Barclaycard suggests the higher cost of filling up the car is taking a significant chunk out of household budgets for motorists. It found spending on petrol was up 16.1% in March compared with a year earlier. But the report, based on data from credit and debit card transactions, signalled consumers were still happy to treat themselves. As the weather improved, spending on pub trips rose 12.5% on a year ago and restaurants enjoyed a similar 12.2% jump. Sales at DIY stores and garden centres were up 4.2% and 9.5%, respectively. Barclaycard said its polling of consumers showed a higher proportion - 41% - were confident in the UK economy in March but that the prospect of higher prices later in the year would prompt a third to shop more at discount stores this year. More than half \u2013 52% \u2013 were more worried about the cost of day-to-day items than they were this time last year, with 74% citing a more expensive weekly shop as the reason. \u201cWhile confidence levels have steadily improved over the past six months, consumers remain fully aware of the potential impact of inflation on their household budgets,\u201d said Paul Lockstone, managing director at Barclaycard.",

      "bodyText": "We know that Barclays chief executive Jes Staley committed a \u201cserious offence\u201d when he tried to unmask a whistleblower, and that the poor thing will now have to get by on just his basic salary of nearly \u00a310,000 a day when his bonus is slashed as punishment. What we don\u2019t know is if the Financial Conduct Authority and the Bank of England\u2019s Prudential Regulation Authority will go further once their investigations are concluded. The regulators\u2019 ultimate weapon is declaring an individual not fit and proper to be a director of the bank and therefore forcing Staley\u2019s dismissal, although Barclays\u2019 share price (which had risen slightly by the close of trading) tells you the market thinks that outcome highly unlikely. Staley\u2019s defence appears to be that the whistleblower was making a malicious personal attack on a colleague, rather than anything substantive about the bank\u2019s operations. It\u2019s difficult to argue that personal issues, whatever they were, really threaten a financial institution. What Staley is probably guilty of is behaving like a bit of a chump. A streak of hot-headedness surfaces in this story, which the experts and advisers appear to have failed to restrain. Has Staley created a culture in which his word is not to be questioned? Or is there another interpretation \u2013 that this is the story of a boss who is intensely loyal to his staff? Maybe, although that\u2019s no defence from breaching fairly transparent rules surrounding whistleblowing. This melodrama is worthy of a Mexican daytime soap, not the head of one of Britain\u2019s biggest banks. The next episode airs on 10 May, when Staley must face shareholders at the bank\u2019s annual general meeting. Staley will likely ride that one out, but when the FCA/PRA final report emerges, the resolution of his future could be a cliffhanger. Patrick Collinson High street retailers face bumpy road ahead Retailers have had a rotten start to 2017. After unexpectedly perky trading conditions late last year, life has got a lot tougher. The latest snapshot of the sector from the British Retail Consortium and KPMG found that sales were lower in March than they were a year earlier, the first decline since the choppy post-Brexit vote environment last August. To be sure, the timing of Easter played a part. Consumers tend to increase their spending over the long bank holiday weekend, and retailers will be expecting the sort of bounce over the coming days that they got in March last year. But it is not just Easter. Three other factors also appear to be playing a part. Firstly, consumers brought forward spending into late 2016 because they anticipated that prices would go up this year as a result of the rising inflation caused by the depreciation of sterling. That fear proved to be well-founded. The annual inflation rate has been rising since the middle of last year and prices are now rising as fast as wages. Secondly, it is now costing consumers more to fill their cars with fuel and to heat their homes. They have less left over to spare on little treats than they did this time last year. Impulse buying has been replaced by a more cautious approach. Finally, consumers appear to have decided that they would rather cut back on spending in the high street than on eating out. Bars and restaurants are doing better than shops. It\u2019s hard to see life getting easier for retailers any time soon. The apprenticeship levy and the higher national minimum wage are adding to their costs at a time when consumers are highly sensitive to prices rises. There will be winners \u2013 Aldi and Lidl spring to mind \u2013 but plenty of losers. Larry Elliott Rail boss pay reward doesn\u2019t seem fare It has become standard practice for large companies to build ever closer links between pay and performance in recent years, the theory being that there should be no rewards for failure. Variable pay ought to be all the more important in businesses whose failings end up hurting ordinary people. That\u2019s why the half a million pound pay packet for Southern Rail boss Charles Horton will raise hackles among passengers. Many have found themselves missing out on jobs or getting home too late to read their children a bedtime story due to repeated delays and cancellations on the stricken network. If they are suffering, why shouldn\u2019t executives suffer with them? Of course, there is more to this than Southern\u2019s management of the franchise. An acrimonious and complex labour dispute over driver-only trains has weighed heavily on Southern. But many passengers will feel that the buck must stop with the company accepting their money.

    "webTitle": "Scott Morrison makes case for negative gearing change \u2013 despite ruling it out", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The latest housing finance figures show that house prices are on track to continue to rise faster for at least another six months, while a speech by the treasurer suggests the government will shy away from touching negative gearing in the May budget. On Tuesday Scott Morrison gave an address to the Australian Housing and Urban Research Institute. It was one of those speeches we get in the run-up to the budget where, in between telling us he doesn\u2019t want to talk about what will or will not be in the budget, the treasurer tells us what will and will not be in the budget. Rather aptly, as he spoke, the latest housing finance figures from the Bureau of Statistics came out. They showed a big drop in investor finance in February of 5.9%. The size of the drop was rather unexpected, and suggest that the measures to limit investor lending by the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority have had an impact. But given it is the second biggest monthly drop since the global financial crisis hit in 2008, it probably should be treated with a bit of caution. I\u2019m not saying the measure is wrong, but it does tend bounce around a bit: The annual growth of investor finance remains solid at 22% in trend terms. Investors continue to the be the big driver of overall housing finance growth, with owner occupiers up just 3.8%: It means that new investor finance has stayed at nearly half of all housing finance \u2013 at 49.3%. Investors are clearly still in the market in a big way: The housing finance growth in the past 12 months of 11.8% suggests that housing prices will also continue to grow at a faster rate. There is strong correlation between the annual growth of housing finance and the annual growth of house prices six months later. By that reckoning the current annual house price growth of 7.7% should continue to rise: The treasurer emphatically ruled out any changes to negative gearing to temper investor lending on Monday. His speech contained a continuation of the regular theme of specious reasons in favour of negative gearing that we have come to expect. He told the audience that \u201cregardless of one\u2019s opinions of the merits or otherwise of negative gearing, it is an established and structural component of Australia\u2019s housing markets. It exists.\u201d It certainly was good to have that cleared up. He then argued that because it is an established part of our housing market that \u201cdisrupting negative gearing would not come without a cost, especially to renters, let alone the wider economic impacts. Proponents of disruptive negative gearing changes have ignored this fact.\u201d Actually those proponents have not ignored it. They have (myself included) noted that the impact of removing negative gearing on rental prices is massively over-egged. We know this is the case because Morrison himself has demonstrated the fallacy of his own reasoning. Just last week he suggested negative gearing was not a key problem because \u201cyou\u2019ve got one set of circumstances over in Perth and to that matter in South Australia and Tasmania. I mean negative gearing and capital gains tax concessions exist there as well and property prices in Perth are going the other way or have been in the eastern states you\u2019ve got a very different response\u201d. He\u2019s quite right. Just because negative gearing exists does not mean prices will always rise in different cities at the same pace. Other factors are in play (such as weak economic conditions). And yet Morrison \u2013 as did his predecessor Joe Hockey \u2013 also likes to suggests abolishing negative gearing will cause rents to rise because when it was briefly abolished in the 1980s, rental prices rose in Sydney and Perth, despite the fact they were flat elsewhere: Thus for Morrison different house prices growth in different cities suggests negative gearing is not an issue, but different rental prices growth suggests it is. Similarly Morrison continued to argue that negative gearing is mostly used by average income earners. He argued that \u201ctwo thirds of those taxpayers who negatively gear their investments have a taxable income of $80,000 or less\u201d. That might be true, but of course it ignores that most of the benefit of negative gearing goes to higher income earners: And crucially his argument ignores the fact that people use negative to gearing in order to reduce their taxable income below $80,000. Oddly he also suggested negative gearing was needed to keep growing the stock of rental accommodation, and yet as the housing finance figures show, investors are more likely to purchase established properties. Just 8% of investor housing finance goes towards construction of new dwellings compared to 13% of owner-occupiers: As Michael Pascoe noted on Twitter during the speech, Morrison was actually making \u201ca strong case for limiting negative gearing to new &amp; off-the-plan dwellings\u201d (which is the ALP\u2019s policy). Rather oddly, Morrison also contrasted the situation in Australia where 27% of housing stock is owned by investors, with the UK, where just 18% is. He did this to argue this was a good thing because rents were cheaper in Australia than the UK. The benefit of negative gearing must be quite pleasing to Sydney renters who have seen their rents in the past decade zoom beyond the growth of inflation: The comparison with the UK also continues the very obtuse argument by the treasurer and prime minister that negative gearing is not an issue because the UK doesn\u2019t have it and housing affordability is also poor there. As Turnbull said last week \u201cLondon is a good example where the negative gearing arrangements we have in Australia are not available\u201d and yet \u201ctheir housing prices are even less affordable than ours\u201d. It\u2019s a bit like an athlete on steroids arguing his drugs didn\u2019t help him because he came second to a clean athlete. No one is saying negative gearing is the only reason for housing unaffordability \u2013 the argument is that it makes it worse. The treasurer\u2019s speech, as expected, featured talk of social housing, supply issues and a focus on renters. Also as expected he completely squibbed the issue of negative gearing. The one hope remains that the budget will see some reduction in the capital gains discount of 50%, but the treasurer\u2019s speech does not bode well for the government doing anything to limit the boom of investors in the housing market.",

They showed a big drop in investor finance in February of 5.9%.</p> <p>The size of the drop was rather unexpected, and suggest that the measures to limit investor lending by the <a href=\"http://www.apra.gov.au/MediaReleases/Pages/17_11.aspx\">Australian Prudential Regulation Authority</a> have had an impact. </p> <p>But given it is the second biggest monthly drop since the global financial crisis hit in 2008, it probably should be treated with a bit of caution. I\u2019m not saying the measure is wrong, but it does tend bounce around a bit:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Monthly growth of investor housing finance\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/Mh9GY/1/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>The annual growth of investor finance remains solid at 22% in trend terms.

It exists.\u201d</p> <p>It certainly was good to have that cleared up.</p> <p>He then argued that because it is an established part of our housing market that \u201cdisrupting negative gearing would not come without a cost, especially to renters, let alone the wider economic impacts. Proponents of disruptive negative gearing changes have ignored this fact.\u201d</p> <p>Actually those proponents have not ignored it. They have (myself included) <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/grogonomics/2017/mar/17/can-budget-2017-fix-housing-affordability-here-are-seven-options\">noted</a> that the impact of removing negative gearing on rental prices is massively over-egged. </p> <p>We know this is the case because Morrison himself has demonstrated the fallacy of his own reasoning.</p> <p> Just <a href=\"http://sjm.ministers.treasury.gov.au/transcript/061-2017/\">last week he suggested</a> negative gearing was not a key problem because \u201cyou\u2019ve got one set of circumstances over in Perth and to that matter in South Australia and Tasmania. I mean negative gearing and capital gains tax concessions exist there as well and property prices in Perth are going the other way or have been in the eastern states you\u2019ve got a very different response\u201d.</p> <p>He\u2019s quite right. Just because negative gearing exists does not mean prices will always rise in different cities at the same pace. Other factors are in play (such as weak economic conditions).</p> <p>And yet Morrison \u2013 as did his predecessor Joe Hockey \u2013 also likes to suggests abolishing negative gearing will cause rents to rise because when it was briefly abolished in the 1980s, rental prices rose in Sydney and Perth, despite the fact they were flat elsewhere:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Annual &quot;real&quot; rent price increases\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/lB2vH/2/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>Thus for Morrison different house prices growth in different cities suggests negative gearing is not an issue, but different rental prices growth suggests it is. </p> <p>Similarly Morrison continued to argue that negative gearing is mostly used by average income earners. He argued that \u201ctwo thirds of those taxpayers who negatively gear their investments have a taxable income of $80,000 or less\u201d. </p> <p>That might be true, but of course it ignores that most of the benefit of negative gearing goes to higher income earners:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Breakdown of negative gearing by taxable family income decile\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/ZidIV/1/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>And crucially his argument ignores the fact that people use negative to gearing in order to reduce their taxable income below $80,000.</p> <p>Oddly he also suggested negative gearing was needed to keep growing the stock of rental accommodation, and yet as the housing finance figures show, investors are more likely to purchase established properties.

      "bodyText": "The Bank of England has found itself under the spotlight again over the fixing of a key interest rate during the credit crunch after new details emerged of bankers discussing Threadneedle Street\u2019s alleged involvement in the setting of Libor. BBC1\u2019s Panorama programme said it had obtained a recording of a 2008 call between two bankers at Barclays in which the more senior person said the government and Bank of England were exerting pressure on it to lower the rate it offered for Libor \u2013 the London interbank offered rate, which is the interest rate banks charge each other for short-term loans. Libor is used as a reference point around the world for loans and mortgages and is set each day by a panel of leading banks, with each one submitting the rates at which it is willing to borrow. Revelations that the rate was rigged at the height of the financial crisis have led to banks being fined hundreds of millions of pounds from a variety of regulators, while bankers from Barclays and UBS have been jailed. The BBC said its investigations added to evidence the Bank of England had pressured commercial banks to push their Libor rates down and that the transcript of the phone conversation at Barclays called into question evidence to the Treasury select committee in 2012 by the former Barclays boss Bob Diamond and Paul Tucker, former deputy governor of the Bank of England. Labour\u2019s shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, called for a new investigation on the back of the broadcaster\u2019s report. \u201cThis is an extremely serious revelation that contradicts past assurances about the role of the Bank of England in the Libor scandal,\u201d he said. \u201cIt goes to the very heart of whether our financial institutions can be trusted. Therefore, it warrants an immediate high-level investigation, and the chancellor must act straight away to ensure this happens.\u201d The BBC said that in the recording, a senior Barclays manager, Mark Dearlove, is heard instructing a Libor submitter, Peter Johnson, to lower his rates. \u201cThe bottom line is you\u2019re going to absolutely hate this ... but we\u2019ve had some very serious pressure from the UK government and the Bank of England about pushing our Libors lower,\u201d Dearlove told Johnson, according to the BBC. Johnson, a 35-year Barclays veteran, pleaded guilty in October 2014 and was sentenced to four years in prison for conspiring to fraudulently rig global benchmark interest rates. The October 2008 conversation between Dearlove and Johnson was first reported in the recently published book on Libor rigging, The Fix, by Gavin Finch and Liam Vaughan. For the Bank of England, the recording returns unwelcome attention to its role during the Libor scandal after it was forced to deal with allegations about pressure on commercial banks during parliamentary hearings almost five years ago. In 2012, the former senior Barclays executive Jerry del Missier justified his decision to order his staff to manipulate interest rates in 2008 by saying he believed he was acting on the instruction of the central bank. Del Missier told MPs on the Treasury select committee that he had issued the instruction after a conversation with his then boss, Diamond, in October 2008, when the financial system was on the brink. Diamond was then running Barclays Capital, the investment banking arm, before being promoted to chief executive. Diamond resigned as chief executive of Barclays in the wake of the \u00a3290m fine received by the bank for attempting to manipulate Libor. Tucker was also called before the committee to explain his dealings with Diamond. The MPs largely exonerated Tucker, but the release of a series of emails, including one in which he referred to Diamond as \u201can absolute brick\u201d, raised questions about his cosy relationship with the City. One member of the current Treasury committee, the Conservative MP Chris Philp, said he had seen the BBC\u2019s \u201cexplosive\u201d evidence. \u201cUrgent enquiry needed,\u201d Philp added on Twitter. The Bank of England said it had provided a statement to the BBC noting that Libor and other global benchmarks were not regulated in the UK or elsewhere at the time. The Bank added it was helping with investigations by the Serious Fraud Office into Libor manipulation by employees at commercial banks and brokers. \u201cThe Bank is committed to publishing materials relating to the SFO\u2019s investigations into benchmark manipulation when it is appropriate to do so. Until the SFO\u2019s ongoing prosecutorial activity relating to Libor and other benchmarks has concluded, the Bank is not in a position to publish these materials,\u201d the statement said. The Treasury also sought to provide reassurances that standards had improved since the Libor scandal. \u201cThe government is absolutely clear that we must learn from the lessons of the past,\u201d said a Treasury spokesman. \u201cThat is why, since the financial crisis, we have carried out wholesale reform of how the financial system is regulated in this country, including making the manipulation of Libor a criminal offence.\u201d A spokesman for Diamond declined to comment. Barclays also declined to comment on behalf of the bank itself or on behalf of Dearlove. Tucker had not responded to a Guardian request for comment at the time of publication.",

The Bank added it was helping with investigations by the Serious Fraud Office into Libor manipulation by employees at commercial banks and brokers.</p> <p>\u201cThe Bank is committed to publishing materials relating to the SFO\u2019s investigations into benchmark manipulation when it is appropriate to do so. Until the SFO\u2019s ongoing prosecutorial activity relating to Libor and other benchmarks has concluded, the Bank is not in a position to publish these materials,\u201d the statement said.</p> <p>The Treasury also sought to provide reassurances that standards had improved since the Libor scandal.</p> <p>\u201cThe government is absolutely clear that we must learn from the lessons of the past,\u201d said a Treasury spokesman.<br></p> <p>\u201cThat is why, since the financial crisis, we have carried out wholesale reform of how the financial system is regulated in this country, including making the manipulation of Libor a criminal offence.\u201d<br></p> <p>A spokesman for Diamond declined to comment. Barclays also declined to comment on behalf of the bank itself or on behalf of Dearlove.<br></p> <p>Tucker had not responded to a Guardian request for comment at the time of publication.<br></p>",

      "bodyText": "The chief executive of Barclays is being investigated by financial regulators and faces a significant cut to his pay after admitting trying to unmask a whistleblower who made allegations about a long-term associate he had brought to the bank. Jes Staley twice attempted to use Barclay\u2019s internal security team to track down the authors of two anonymous letters sent to the board and a senior executive at the bank last June. On the second occasion, the security team received assistance from a US law enforcement agency, but still failed to identify the whistleblowers. The letters are understood to have made allegations about the previous conduct of Tim Main, who worked with Staley at US bank JP Morgan and was then recruited to Barclays in a senior role last June. Main declined to comment but, according to Barclays, the letters raised concerns of \u201ca personal nature about the senior employee, Mr Staley\u2019s knowledge of and role in dealing with those issues at a previous employer, and the appropriateness of the recruitment process followed on this occasion by Barclays\u201d. In an internal email to Barclays staff, seen by the Guardian, Staley tried to justify attempting to find the author of the letters, accusing the whistleblowers of harassment and trying to \u201cmaliciously smear\u201d Main, who is chair of Barclays\u2019 financial institutions group in New York. Staley wrote: \u201cOne of our colleagues was the subject of an unfair personal attack sent via anonymous letters addressed to members of the board and a senior executive at Barclays. The allegations related to personal issues from many years ago, and the intent of the correspondents in airing all of this was, in my view, to maliciously smear this person. \u201cIn my desire to protect our colleague, however, I got too personally involved in this matter. My hope was that if we found out who was sending these letters we could try and get them to stop the harassment of a person who did not deserve that treatment. Nevertheless, I realise that I should simply have the compliance function handle this matter, as they were doing. This was a mistake on my part and I apologise for it.\u201d Barclays announced in a stock market statement that Staley and the bank were under investigation by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) and the Bank of England\u2019s Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA) for the affair. New York\u2019s Department of Financial Services is also looking into Staley\u2019s behaviour. It is extremely rare for financial regulators to investigate and censure chief executives in the City. The FCA, the main City regulator, has the power to ban individuals from working in financial services if they are not deemed to be fit and proper, as well as issuing public reprimands and fines. Barclays said that its internal investigation led by law firm Simmons &amp; Simmons had concluded that Staley acted \u201chonestly but mistakenly\u201d in trying to track down the authors of the letters. However, Barclays admitted it was a \u201cserious\u201d offence that would lead to its chief executive receiving a formal written reprimand and a \u201cvery significant\u201d cut to his bonus. John Mann, the Labour MP and member of the Treasury select committee, called on Staley to resign while the Institute of Directors said it was \u201cclearly disappointing\u201d that Barclays had breached its own rules on protecting whistleblowers. Gary Greenwood, an analyst at stockbroker Shore Capital, said: \u201cGiven Barclays\u2019 history of regulatory misdemeanours, most notably the high profile investigation into Libor rigging which led to former CEO Bob Diamond\u2019s departure from the group, this latest revelation represents a very significant embarrassment for the board as it tries to rebuild the group\u2019s reputation.\u201d Staley is a veteran US banker and took the helm at Barclays in December 2015. He pledged to overhaul its culture, which had been in the spotlight due to the bank\u2019s involvement in rigging the Libor interest rate, for which it was ordered to pay a fine of nearly \u00a3290m. The whistleblowing saga comes at a crucial time for Barclays. The Serious Fraud Office is close to deciding whether it will prosecute the bank and former executives about its \u00a37.3bn Middle Eastern bailout at the height of the financial crisis in 2008. The SFO\u2019s investigation centres on whether \u00a32bn that Barclays lent to Qatar was then returned to the bank. The board was alerted earlier this year to Staley\u2019s attempts to identify the whistleblower when an employee raised concerns about the bank\u2019s whistleblowing procedures. John McFarlane, the chairman of Barclays, said: \u201cI am personally very disappointed and apologetic that this situation has occurred, particularly as we strive to operate to the highest possible ethical standards. The board takes Barclays\u2019 culture and the integrity of its controls extremely seriously. \u201cThe board has concluded that Jes Staley, group chief executive officer, honestly, but mistakenly, believed that it was permissible to identify the author of the letter and has accepted his explanation that he was trying to protect a colleague who had experienced personal difficulties in the past from what he believed to be an unfair attack, and has accepted his apology.\u201d Staley said he had apologised to the Barclays board for the saga and will cooperate with the FCA and PRA probes. Staley was paid \u00a34.2m last year including an annual bonus of \u00a31.4m. For this year, he was in line for an annual bonus of up to \u00a31.88m plus another payment under the long-term incentive plan of up to \u00a32.82m, on top of his annual fixed pay of about \u00a32.35m. The bank said it will decide on how much to cut Staley\u2019s pay by when the financial regulators have concluded their investigations. Profile: the US banker who vowed to restore Barclays\u2019 reputation When Jes Staley took over at Barclays, the veteran banker vowed to \u201cstrengthen trust\u201d in the group after its reputation had been damaged by successive scandals. The 60-year-old American was named chief executive in late 2015 following the ousting of predecessor Antony Jenkins. In an email to staff when he was appointed, he said: \u201cThe trust of our customers and clients [...] is the foundation of our success, the most valuable quality we can nurture and the key to unlocking shareholder value.\u201d Born in Boston, Massachusetts, James Edward Staley, nicknamed \u201cJes\u201d, studied economics at Bowdoin, a liberal arts and science college in Maine. He spent 30 years at Wall Street institution JP Morgan, enjoying a record of success that saw him promoted to chief executive of its investment banking arm in 2009. His tenure ended in 2013 after he allegedly lost patience waiting to take over from chief executive Jamie Dimon. Staley was credited with improving JP Morgan\u2019s attitude towards LGBT issues. This was informed by the activism of his brother Peter, who was diagnosed HIV-positive in the 1980s. In an interview with the brothers in Fortune, Peter said he initially assumed Jes would be the \u201cmost homophobic person in the family\u201d but found him supportive. Staley, who has two daughters with wife, Deby, is a devoted fan of baseball team the Boston Red Sox, a keen sailor and a supporter of the Democratic party.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The high court has approved a settlement between Tesco and the Serious Fraud Office that involves Britain\u2019s biggest retailer paying a \u00a3129m fine over an accounting scandal. Sir Brian Leveson approved the so-called deferred prosecution agreement (DPA) at a hearing on Monday. Reporting restrictions mean the reason for Leveson\u2019s judgment and details about the SFO\u2019s investigation cannot be published. The DPA was announced by Tesco and the SFO last month, pending approval by the high court. DPAs, which were introduced in the UK in February 2014, allow a company to suspend a prosecution in return for meeting specified conditions, such as paying a fine and demonstrating that its culture has changed. Entering into a DPA does not require an admission of wrongdoing. The DPA relates to allegations of false accounting between February and September 2014 against Tesco Stores Limited, a subsidiary of the retailer. Tesco admitted in 2014 that it had overstated profits by \u00a3326m, sparking a crisis at the company. This overstatement was linked to how it booked payments from suppliers. The ruling means that Tesco will pay out \u00a3235m to settle investigations into the 2014 accounting scandal. As well as the \u00a3129m, it has separately agreed with the Financial Conduct Authority to pay about \u00a385m in compensation to investors affected by a trading statement on 29 August 2014 that overstated profits. Tesco will also pay legal costs associated with the agreements. Dave Lewis, the chief executive of Tesco, said last month that the settlement allowed the company to move on. \u201cI want to apologise to all those affected. What happened is a huge source of regret to us all at Tesco, but we are a different business now,\u201d he said. He admitted the Tesco brand had been damaged by the disclosure of the accounting scandal, but said the company was \u201ccommitted to doing everything we can to continue to restore trust in our business and brand\u201d. The DPA is the fourth to be completed by the SFO after settlements with Standard Bank, Rolls-Royce and another company that cannot be named for legal reasons. Rolls-Royce agreed to pay \u00a3671m over allegations that it bribed middlemen around the world between 1989 and 2013. The SFO said it would not comment on the Tesco DPA until reporting restrictions were lifted. Earlier this month, David Green, the director of the SFO, warned that British businesses should not consider DPAs the \u201cnew normal\u201d if they were caught misbehaving. Speaking about DPAs in general, Green said: \u201cWe are an investigating and prosecuting organisation, that is what we do. But having been given this new power, which comes from a US model, and has been adapted for this jurisdiction, we will use it only in very specific circumstances. \u201cAbsolutely crucial to those circumstances is that the company has been fully cooperative with us. If a company is totally uncooperative and sort of leads us a merry dance for four or five years by not cooperating with our investigation, I am sure you would agree that it would be almost impossible for us to represent to the judge that the DPA was in the interests of justice. Companies that don\u2019t cooperate will be prosecuted.\u201d",

Entering into a DPA does not require an admission of wrongdoing. </p> <p>The DPA relates to allegations of false accounting between February and September 2014 against Tesco Stores Limited, a subsidiary of the retailer.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/tesco\">Tesco</a> admitted in 2014 that it had overstated profits by \u00a3326m, sparking a crisis at the company. This overstatement was linked to how it booked payments from suppliers. The ruling means that Tesco will pay out \u00a3235m to settle investigations into the 2014 accounting scandal.</p> <p>As well as the \u00a3129m, it has separately agreed with the Financial Conduct Authority to pay about \u00a385m in compensation to investors affected by a trading statement on 29 August 2014 that overstated profits. Tesco will also pay legal costs associated with the agreements.</p> <p>Dave Lewis, the chief executive of Tesco, said last month that the settlement allowed the company to move on. \u201cI want to apologise to all those affected. What happened is a huge source of regret to us all at Tesco, but we are a different business now,\u201d he said.</p> <p>He admitted the Tesco brand had been damaged by the disclosure of the accounting scandal, but said the company was \u201ccommitted to doing everything we can to continue to restore trust in our business and brand\u201d.</p> <p>The DPA is the fourth to be completed by the SFO after settlements with Standard Bank, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/jan/20/rolls-royce-bribery-scandal-whats-the-best-price-for-a-silver-sprint-ii\">Rolls-Royce </a>and another company that cannot be named for legal reasons.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Rolls-Royce <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/jan/16/rolls-royce-to-pay-671m-over-bribery-claims\">agreed to pay \u00a3671m</a> over allegations that it bribed middlemen around the world between 1989 and 2013.</p> <p>The SFO said it would not comment on the Tesco DPA until reporting restrictions were lifted.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/apr/01/serious-fraud-office-deferred-prosecution-agreements\">Earlier this month, David Green, the director of the SFO, warned</a> that British businesses should not consider DPAs the \u201cnew normal\u201d if they were caught misbehaving.</p> <p>Speaking about DPAs in general, Green said: \u201cWe are an investigating and prosecuting organisation, that is what we do. But having been given this new power, which comes from a US model, and has been adapted for this jurisdiction, we will use it only in very specific circumstances.</p> <p>\u201cAbsolutely crucial to those circumstances is that the company has been fully cooperative with us. If a company is totally uncooperative and sort of leads us a merry dance for four or five years by not cooperating with our investigation, I am sure you would agree that it would be almost impossible for us to represent to the judge that the DPA was in the interests of justice. Companies that don\u2019t cooperate will be prosecuted.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "Fashion chain Jaeger has collapsed into administration, putting 680 jobs at risk. The brand, which dressed Audrey Hepburn and Marilyn Monroe in its heyday, had been trying to find a buyer to keep its 46 stores going, but its owner threw in the towel on Monday and appointed administrators. The private equity owner of Jaeger, which dates back to 1884, has appointed administrators at Alix Partners after proving unable to find a buyer for a suggested price of \u00a330m. The company has failed to turn a profit since private equity veteran Jon Moulton\u2019s Better Capital bought the firm for \u00a319.5m in 2012. Jaeger employs about 680 staff across 46 stores, 63 concessions, its head office in London and a logistics centre in King\u2019s Lynn. Peter Saville, Ryan Grant and Catherine Williamson, joint administrators at Alix Partners, said they had been called in \u201cat the request of Jaeger\u2019s directors as a result of the company being unable to attract suitable offers\u201d. \u201cRegrettably, despite an extensive sales process, it has not been possible to identify a purchaser for the business,\u201d Saville said. \u201cOur focus now is in identifying an appropriate route forward and to work with all stakeholders to do this.\u201d Last week Better Capital sold Jaeger\u2019s debt to a company understood to be controlled by the retail billionaire Philip Day, who heads Edinburgh Woollen Mill. Insiders now expect most of Jaeger\u2019s stores to close down, although the brand is likely to survive as part of the EWM stable, which includes Jane Norman, Peacocks and Austin Reed. Jaeger was founded as Dr Jaeger\u2019s Sanitary Woollen System Co Ltd in 1884 by Lewis Tomalin, an accountant who was inspired by a health craze promulgated by Gustav Jaeger, a German professor of zoology. Jaeger believed people would be healthier if they dressed in clothing made from animal hair, wool and fleece. Earlier this year, Better Capital hired Alix Partners to flush out interest from potential partners or to find a buyer. Last year, Jaeger\u2019s sales fell from \u00a384.2m to \u00a378.4m and it made a \u00a35.4m pre-tax loss, according to accounts filed at Companies House. Jaeger is the latest in a long list of retailers to suffer from difficult trading conditions on the high street and the increased cost of imported materials due to the collapse of the pound. Jones Bootmaker was rescued by Endless in a pre-pack administration deal last week and 99p Stores was placed into administration in March. The 99p Stores chain collapsed less than two years after rival Poundland bought it for \u00a355m. Andy Brian, head of retail at Gordons law firm, said: \u201cThis is another blow for the high street and, crucially, another indication of the huge consumer shift towards online shopping. Like BHS last year, Jaeger has failed to capitalise on the growth of online retailing. As a result, it has been left behind \u2013 and left struggling \u2013 where other fashion retailers have grabbed the opportunity. \u201cJaeger has relied on its concession model but it\u2019s clear that having a bricks and mortar presence on the high street \u2013 even in this cost-effective way \u2013 is no longer enough. Online shopping is growing faster than ever and retailers must keep up, otherwise they will no longer be able to compete. Jaeger are not the only chain to have struggled with this shift \u2013 and we can expect more famous retail brands to go into administration this year for the same reasons.\u201d",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The man in charge of Southern rail, the train network that has become synonymous with delays, cancellations and strike action, was paid \u00a3495,000 last year. The deal awarded to Charles Horton, chief executive of Southern\u2019s parent firm Govia Thameslink (GTR), drew fire from the National Union of Rail, Maritime and Transport workers (RMT) and the Labour party. Horton was paid \u00a3478,000 by GTR and also received a further \u00a317,000 in pay from a former division of the group, Southern Railway Limited, taking his total to nearly half a million pounds. In the previous year, due to a rearrangement of the company\u2019s corporate structure, he was paid by both Southern and GTR, earning a total of \u00a3493,000. Horton\u2019s pay remained broadly flat despite a year of misery for 300,000 passengers on the Southern network, which was ranked the worst in Britain last summer. Nearly a third of its trains were late in 2016 as it wrestled with a prolonged labour dispute that descended into ongoing strike action, as unions battled planned changes to the role of conductors. Horton was awarded the pay packet despite Govia Thameslink reporting a pre-tax loss of more than \u00a315m on turnover of \u00a31.1bn for the year ending 2 July 2016, according to accounts filed at Companies House. A spokesman for the RMT lashed out at what he called \u201ctelephone number pay\u201d that \u201cshows a real sense of twisted priorities\u201d. \u201cOn one hand, senior management are scooping up huge sums of money, whilst on the other hand, the guards are being systematically undermined and set up for abuse for having the audacity to fight for passenger safety,\u201d the spokesman said. \u201cYou\u2019ve got 400 guards on Southern Rail who have been fighting for a year for passenger safety and have had nothing but abuse and threats from the company. Back in the boardroom it\u2019s help yourself, line your pockets.\u201d Andy McDonald, Labour\u2019s transport spokesman, said the pay deal strengthened the party\u2019s argument for renationalisation of the railways. \u201cWith season ticket prices shooting up at a rate way above the average increase in earnings, those at the top of Southern\u2019s parent company, Govia Thameslink, clearly have no shame in dishing out extraordinarily large pay packages to themselves,\u201d he said. \u201cThe audacity with which train operating companies are extracting value from our railways is quite astonishing. \u201cA Labour government would bring the railways into public ownership as franchising agreements lapsed, a policy which has wide support right across the country. Accordingly, under Labour the railways would be run in the public sector, in the best interests of taxpayers and passengers alike.\u201d David Brown, the chief executive of Go-Ahead, the parent company of Govia Thameslink, refused an annual bonus and pay increase in September given the disruption on the network. Go-Ahead\u2019s annual report states: \u201cThe directors\u2019 remuneration policy is designed to reflect the group\u2019s performance, with elements of remuneration linked to our strategic priorities, particularly health and safety, customer satisfaction, and operating profit and cashflow.\u201d Southern Rail said that it ran 95% of services on time during the latest RMT strike on Saturday, after 55% of conductors and \u201con-board supervisors\u201d showed up for work. GTR, which also owns Thameslink, Great Northern and Gatwick Express, declined to comment on pay. \u2022 This article was amended on Monday 10 April to make clear that Charles Horton\u2019s \u00a3495,000 pay package was broadly the same as the previous year, and had not nearly doubled, as reported earlier.",

      "bodyText": "UK high streets are expected to be busy this Easter weekend, with forecasters predicting an increase in the number of people going out to spend money on food and drink. Mild spring weather and the fact that the bank holiday weekend falls not long after March\u2019s payday, are expected to lead to an 8.8% increase in the number of shoppers on the high street, according to the latest footfall predictions from retail analyst Springboard. In total, footfall to all outlets, including retail parks, is expected to be up by 5.4% year on year, in contrast to a 1.9% fall over Easter 2016. Springboard director Diane Wehrle said: \u201cLast year Easter took place on 25 March, a few days in advance of national payday for many shoppers. This combined with poor weather, impacted footfall, which declined across retail destinations from Easter Saturday onwards.\u201d She added: \u201cMild spring weather is forecast for this Easter, which falls after the national payday. This strongly indicates that more shoppers will visit retail destinations over the weekend compared with last year.\u201d Springboard said retail footfall was up by 1.2% in March following six months of decline, but there was a move towards evening spending at food and drink outlets as shoppers prioritised experiences over goods. It said while, historically, 25% of sales in stores over the long Easter weekend were made in fashion retailers and 10% were at food and beverage outlets, this year it expected the figures to move towards 20% and 15% respectively. Separate figures from Visa show a modest rise in household spending in March, with the increase of 1% year on year slightly below February\u2019s figure of 1.6%. However, while spending on household goods, and clothing and footwear was down, spending on recreation and culture was up by 7.2%, while hotels saw a 4% boost. Springboard said its prediction that high streets would be busy over the holiday period was \u201ca reflection of their resilience over the year to date; their adaptability and diverse hospitality offering means they are able to expand and respond to trends more quickly than retail parks and shopping centres\u201d. However, online sales will continue to grow much more rapidly than visits to retailers, with ecommerce data firm PCA Predict forecasting a 17% increase in transactions over the four-day weekend. Visa\u2019s figures also underlined the shift towards online shopping, with virtual retailers recording a 8.2% increase in spending in March, while the high street reported a 1.3% fall. Chris Harle at PCA Predict said Easter Monday was typically one of the busiest days of the year for online shopping, and this year was unlikely to be different. He said customers were increasingly using mobile phones and tablets to do their shopping, and these channels were expected to account for 49% of online purchases over the weekend. \u201cWith good weather in sight, it is likely that mobile shoppers will continue to make purchases out in the sunshine via smartphone or tablet ... We are also likely to see consistent mobile usage throughout the day, including over the dinner table, with few dramatic spikes.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Here\u2019s a roundup of the day\u2019s events involving the Barclays whistleblower: Regulators are investigating the bank and its chief executive Jes Staley after he attempted to unmask a whistleblower who had written anonymous letters expressing concerns about a senior executive. Staley ordered an investigation in an effort to identify the whistleblower but was susequently told this was not appropriate. But a month later, in what the bank called an \u201chonestly held but mistaken belief,\u201d he thought he had clearance to identify the author of the letters. The executive involved was named as Tim Main, who joined the bank in June 2016 as chairman of the investment bank\u2019s financial institutions group. In an email to staff Staley admitted he had made a mistake and said he had got too personally involved. He said he wanted to prevent continuing smears against an individual who did not deserve it. Staley has been formally reprimanded and faces losing part of his bonus. MP John Mann said if the story was true Staley should resign and the Institute of Directors said the situation was \u201cclearly disappointing.\u201d Barclays had made a point of saying in its annual report that staff could raise concerns in confidence without fear of retaliation. Our latest report on Barclays is here: Still with the banking sector, and the Bank of England is facing new claims it interfered with the setting of libor rates during the 2008 financial crisis, according to the BBC\u2019s Panorama programme. On that note, it\u2019s time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. Reuters Breaking Views columnist Dominic Elliott says Jes Staley\u2019s actions may seem morally defensible since he wanted to defend a colleague from what he saw as unfounded smears, but the situation calls Barclays\u2019 internal procedures into question. Elliott concludes: Given Staley should have known the rules, it reflects badly on him. It also looks bad for Barclays: the incident only came to light as a result of a separate complaint about the bank\u2019s whistleblowing regime this year. That suggests more profound failings. A board-instigated review of the related procedures feels like too little, too late. More reaction to the Barclays whistleblowing: Cathy James, chief executive of whistleblowing charity Public Concern at Work: In a bizarre way this is whistleblowing working. The board has become aware of inappropriate conduct at the highest level and has taken action - they have then made a public statement - this is a bold move but it also shows that they want to mitigate against the damage done by the CEO\u2019s actions. This is to be seen in the context of regulators in the sector pushing the agenda and an ongoing investigation. It\u2019s these sort of cases, where senior executives are involved, that show how important it is... It\u2019s too early to say whether there is going to be marked change though. Employment lawyer Anna Birtwistle from CM Murray: While cutting Mr Staley\u2019s pay may outwardly appear to represent a strong response from Barclays, it is difficult to reconcile the Board\u2019s continued confidence in Mr Staley with its stated commitment to whistleblowing. Fostering an open culture of disclosing wrongdoing in the workplace requires top down stewardship and while it may be understandable that Barclays has backed Mr Staley given his successes in post, the bank\u2019s response to Mr Staley\u2019s actions may give mixed messages to its employees and the wider financial services industry about the steadfastness of its commitment to whistleblowing. Barclays boss Jes Staley has just sent an email out to all staff defending his actions. While apologising and saying he would co-operate with the investigation he said he acted because he believed the whistleblower\u2019s actions were intended to maliciously smear the executive involved. But he admitted he had got \u201ctoo personally involved\u201d adding: \u201cMy hope was that if we found out who was sending these letters we could try and get them to stop the harassment of a person who did not deserve that treatment.\u201d And he said he realised he should have let the compliance department handle the matter and that was a mistake. More reaction to the whistleblowing news. Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: Incidents like this do nothing to convince the public that banking misdemeanours are in the rear-view mirror, and this is undoubtedly an embarrassment, not to mention a distraction, for Barclays and its CEO. Barclays has actually been doing quite well under Jes Staley\u2019s leadership, so this error is a blemish in what was starting to look like a promising tenure. Shareholders will be doubly disappointed that the bank is once again in trouble with regulators, and that the man at the top of the organisation is responsible for it. The Barclays share price hasn\u2019t reacted much to news of this investigation, which is probably a sad reflection that the market thinks the potential costs of this infringement are small beer in the context of the litigation and conduct costs racked up by the bank in recent years. The person Barclays boss Jes Staley was trying to protect because he thought the anonymous letters \u201cwere an unfair personal attack on the senior employee\u201d has been named as Tim Main. Main joined Barclays in June 2016 to be chairman of the investment bank\u2019s financial institutions group, based in New York. He joined Barclays from Evercore but had previously spent 20 years at JP Morgan. Before moving to Barclays he advised on a number of major deals including the merger of Wachovia and Wells Fargo banks. At the time of his appointment John Miller, Barclay\u2019s head of America\u2019s banking, said: \u201cTim has an outstanding track record and vast knowledge, experience and relationships. His expertise fits perfectly with our origination-led banking model. This appointment reflects our ongoing commitment to bringing top-tier talent into Barclays, and providing clients with first-class strategic advice.\u201d Our updated report on the whistleblowing is here: Barclays appointed non-executive director Mike Ashley (not the Sports Direct founder!) as whistleblower\u2019s champion in 2016, and in the bank\u2019s most recent annual report he had this to say: \u201cAn additional responsibility I have assumed under the Senior Managers Regime is that of Whistleblower\u2019s Champion, a position required by the FCA to be held at Board level. As champion, I have specific responsibility for the integrity, independence and effectiveness of the Barclays\u2019 policies and procedures on whistleblowing, including the procedures for protecting employees who raise concerns from detrimental treatment. During 2016, I recorded a video message to all employees Group-wide, highlighting my role as Whistleblower\u2019s Champion and raising awareness of the policies and procedures we have in place.\u201d (Our emphasis) Also according to the annual report, the bank\u2019s audit committee also looked at \u201cthe adequacy of the Group\u2019s arrangements to allow employees to raise concerns in confidence without fear of retaliation and the outcomes of any substantiated cases.\u201d It concluded that \u201cBarclays\u2019 processes were appropriate and in line with peers. It noted that the successful internal campaign had generated an increase in the number of whistleblowing reports, all of which were investigated. Volumes of cases remain proportionate to Barclays\u2019 size and footprint. The Committee asked management to provide additional detail in its future reports where any whistleblowing investigation was outstanding for more than six months. In future, as Barclays Whistleblowing Champion, the Chairman of the Committee will make an annual report to the Board on whistleblowing matters.\u201d Here\u2019s a quote in an internal memo to Barclays staff from Jes Staley when he was named as the new chief executive in 2015: There can be no retreat from becoming a values-driven organisation which conducts itself with integrity at all times. And here\u2019s a comment from JP Morgan boss Jamie Dimon about Staley in a Fortune report from 2010 (H/T Thomas Candela): Jes has impeccable character and integrity. Jes Staley\u2019s attempts to track down a whistleblower are \u201cclearly disappointing\u201d and the action from regulators should be a wake-up call to company boards. Oliver Parry, the IoD\u2019s head of corporate governance tells my colleague Julia Kollewe: Protection for whistle-blowers is vital if employees are to feel confident in reporting problems, so it is clearly disappointing that Barclays has conceded its CEO breached the rules. The bank has admitted its error, and it is right that the CEO has had his pay cut to show the seriousness of the issue. Barclays is absolutely correct to review its processes to make sure this doesn\u2019t happen again, and shareholders will want further clarity at the upcoming annual meeting. The UK has a reputation for high standards of corporate governance, but boards only work when all directors are aware of their roles and responsibilities. Today\u2019s action from the regulator should be a wake-up call to executives to make sure they constantly refresh their knowledge of the rules. John Mann, the Labour MP and member of the Treasury Committee, is not impressed. He said if the regulators were indeed probing Barclays over the attempts to identify the whistleblower, the bank\u2019s chief executive Jes Staley \u201chas to resign\u201d. Here\u2019s some reaction to the Barclays situation. Economist Shaun Richards writes: I would imagine that pretty much everyone reading this is aware of modern whistleblowing procedures so it seems strange that the CEO of Barclays was not. Actually even when he was told he had another go a month later. There is a clear example of \u201cback to the future\u201d when we note that rather than being sacked we move into Yes Prime Minister land as he will receive one of the \u201cstrongly worded letters\u201d so beloved of the apochryphal civil servant Sir Humphrey Appleby! We are told there will be this too \u201ca very significant compensation adjustment will be made to Mr Staley\u2019s variable compensation award.\u201d But as it is \u201cvariable\u201d how will we know? And a former Tory local councillor says: Richard\u2019s \u201cmonth later\u201d comment refers to this section of the Barclays statement: \u00b7 Having been given a copy of the first letter [received in June 2016] and made aware of the second, Mr Staley initially requested that the Group Information Security (GIS) team attempt to identify the authors of the letters. Mr Staley considered that the letters were an unfair personal attack on the senior employee. \u00b7 Mr Staley was subsequently informed that it was not appropriate to take steps to identify the authors. Following this, neither Mr Staley nor the GIS team took any such further action. \u00b7 In July 2016, Mr Staley enquired whether the whistleblowing issue with the letters had been cleared. Following this, Mr Staley\u2019s honestly held, but mistaken, belief was that he had clearance to identify the author of one of the letters. Back with the latest Libor reports and the Bank of England has issued the response it made to the BBC\u2019s Panorama programme: Libor and other global benchmarks were not regulated in the UK or elsewhere during the period in question. Nonetheless, the Bank of England has been assisting the SFO\u2019s criminal investigations into Libor manipulation by employees at commercial banks and brokers by providing, on a voluntary basis, documents and records requested by the SFO. The Bank is committed to publishing materials relating to the SFO\u2019s investigations into benchmark manipulation when it is appropriate to do so. Until the SFO\u2019s ongoing prosecutorial activity relating to Libor and other benchmarks has concluded, the Bank is not in a position to publish these materials. Here\u2019s our report on the attempt by Barclays boss Jes Staley to track down a whistleblower: Barclays has refused to comment on whether the US Department of Financial Services is also investigating. Here\u2019s what The Barclays Way - its code of conduct - has to say on the subject of employees raising concerns: Sometimes the actions of a few may put our reputation at stake. If you believe something is not right \u2013 like misconduct, fraud or illegal activity \u2013 or if you feel that our standards aren\u2019t being met, it is really important that you speak up. Any concerns you may have can be raised in confidence by: \u2022 Discussing the matter with your manager, or manager\u2019s manager \u2022 Talking directly to your local Compliance team \u2022 Contacting the Whistleblowing team via the Raising Concerns hotline or mailbox. Concerns raised are taken seriously, treated sensitively, and where appropriate, independently investigated. Where permitted by law, you can raise your concerns with the Whistleblowing team anonymously. (Our italics) Barclays is not only facing an investigation into chief executive Jes Staley\u2019s attempts to unmask a whistleblower from UK regulators. The Department of Financial Services in New York is also looking into the matter, according to Bloomberg. City trader Tom Hayes, the first person convicted of rigging Libor and serving an 11-year sentence, has issued a statement on the BBC story that the Bank of England put pressure on banks to lower their rates: The involvement of the Bank of England in lowballing Libor was a key plank of my defence. The prosecution did not give me the evidence I needed to prove it and my jury were misled. It is my view that there should be an urgent public inquiry into the real Libor scandal: where central banks, politicians and the British Bankers\u2019 Association colluded to get artificially low Libor rates. Traders like me should not be in prison - we were only requesting Libor submissions that reflected market conditions. I have now been in a high security prison for over 18 months but I swear that I did not know that requesting Libor rates that benefitted my bank but which also reflected the market was wrong. So far this latest run-in with the regulators has not had much effect on Barclays share price. It is down just 0.2% at 214.85p. Regulatory fatigue? Or do investors believe a severe reprimand for a FTSE 100 chief executive and a subsequent bonus cut - an event rare as hen\u2019s teeth - is nothing much to worry about? Or is everyone off on their Easter break? Barclays says that in the wake of its chief executive Jes Staley\u2019s attempts to track down the whistleblower \u201ca very significant compensation adjustment will be made to Mr Staley\u2019s variable compensation award.\u201d My colleague Julia Kollewe has crunched the numbers: Jes Staley received a total pay package of \u00a34.2m last year including an annual bonus of \u00a31.3m (60% of his maximum bonus opportunity for the year). For this year, he is in line for an annual bonus of up to \u00a31.88m and another bonus under the long-term incentive plan of up to \u00a32.82m, on top of his annual fixed pay, which amounted to \u00a32.35m last year. The full Barclays statement on the investigation is here. The Bank of England may be relieved that Barclays\u2019 woes have taken some of the attention away from new claims it had interfered with the setting of libor rates - which tracks how much it costs banks to borrow from each other. A BBC Panorama report claims a secret recording shows the Bank repeatedly put pressure on commercial banks to push their libor rates down during the 2008 financial crisis. The BBC story is here. This is a problem Barclays could have done without after its host of regulatory issues, but removing Staley from his post could set back its attempts to revive the business, says analyst Gary Greenwood at Shore Capital: Given Barclays\u2019 history of regulatory misdemeanours, most notably the high profile investigation into Libor rigging which led to former CEO Bob Diamond\u2019s departure from the group, this latest revelation represents a very significant embarrassment for the Board as it tries to rebuild the group\u2019s reputation. As for Mr Staley, it remains to be seen whether the PRA and FCA come to the same conclusion as the Board in allowing him to remain in his post, although we would assume that the sanctions proposed will have already been discussed with the regulators and should therefore help to mitigate this risk. It is possible that the group may also be fined by the regulators. Operationally, we believe that Barclays has made excellent progress under the stewardship of Jes Staley, notably in respect of running off non-core assets and rebuilding the capital base. To remove Mr Staley from his role at this juncture would be damaging to further operational progress, with an improvement in return on equity now the key area of focus. While Mr Staley\u2019s reputation has undoubtedly taken a serious knock, we believe that it remains in the best interests of shareholders to keep him in the post of CEO and hence we recommend that they follow the Board\u2019s direction and vote in favour of his reappointment at the AGM in May. Staley said: I have apologised to the Barclays Board, and accepted its conclusion that my personal actions in this matter were errors on my part. I will also accept whatever sanction it deems appropriate. I will cooperate fully with the Financial Conduct Authority and the Prudential Regulatory Authority, which are now both examining this matter. Our whistleblowing process is one of the most important means by which we protect our culture and values at Barclays and I certainly want to ensure that all colleagues, and others who may utilise it, understand the criticality which I attach to it. The whole thing started in June 2016 when the bank\u2019s board and a senior executive both received anonymous letters about a senior executive who had been recruited earlier in the year. Barclays said: Amongst other issues, the letters raised concerns of a personal nature about the senior employee, Mr Staley\u2019s knowledge of and role in dealing with those issues at a previous employer, and the appropriateness of the recruitment process followed on this occasion by Barclays. When he found out about the letters, Staley attempted to find out who had written them. The bank said he \u201chonestly, but mistakenly, believed that it was permissible to identify the author of the letter.\u201d He asked the bank\u2019s Group Information Security (GIS) team to investigate and GIS contacted a US law enforcement agency for help.But to no avail, and the whistleblower was not identified. The board found out about Staley\u2019s actions as \u201ca result of a concern raised by an employee regarding amongst other matters the adequacy of Barclays whistleblowing procedures.\u201d After its own investigation into Staley\u2019s actions Barclays says it \u201c accepted his explanation that he was trying to protect a colleague who had experienced personal difficulties in the past from what he believed to be an unfair attack, and has accepted his apology. \u201cTaking into account both the circumstances of this matter and his otherwise exemplary record since joining Barclays, including contributing significantly to improvements in Barclays culture and controls, Jes continues to have the Board\u2019s unanimous confidence and it will support his re-appointment at Barclays Annual General Meeting on 10 May 2017.\u201d Barclays says it will co-operate with the investigation by the regulators, and will also review its whistleblowing processes. The banks\u2019 chairman John McFarlane, said: I am personally very disappointed and apologetic that this situation has occurred, particularly as we strive to operate to the highest possible ethical standards. The Board takes Barclays culture and the integrity of its controls extremely seriously. We have investigated this matter fully using an external law firm and we will be commissioning an independent review of Barclays processes and controls to determine what improvements may be required. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. It\u2019s a quiet day on the economic and results front but not for the banking sector, albeit in a way which does it no favours. The Bank of England has again been embroiled in the never-ending Libor scandal (more in a moment), but first over to Barclays. The bank and its chief executive Jes Staley are being investigated by regulators over his attempts in 2016 to unmask a whistleblower who had written to express concerns about a recently recruited senior executive. Barclays said Staley\u2019s attempt to identify the whistleblower came to its attention in early 2017 and it started an investigation by law firm Simmons &amp; Simmons, and also told the regulator the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) and the Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA). Staley said he \u201chonestly but mistakenly believed that it was permissible to identify the author of the letter.\u201d It plans to formally reprimand Staley and will cut his compensation payment by a \u201cvery significant\u201d amount.",

Elliott concludes:</p> <blockquote> <p>Given Staley should have known the rules, it reflects badly on him. It also looks bad for Barclays: the incident only came to light as a result of a separate complaint about the bank\u2019s whistleblowing regime this year. That suggests more profound failings. A board-instigated review of the related procedures feels like too little, too late.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-58eb6fe4e4b0e0ec04eff8f4\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-04-10T11:47:13.604Z\">12.47pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>More reaction to the Barclays whistleblowing:</p> <h2>Cathy James, chief executive of whistleblowing charity Public Concern at Work:</h2> <p>In a bizarre way this is whistleblowing working. The board has become aware of inappropriate conduct at the highest level and has taken action - they have then made a public statement - this is a bold move but it also shows that they want to mitigate against the damage done by the CEO\u2019s actions. This is to be seen in the context of regulators in the sector pushing the agenda and an ongoing investigation. It\u2019s these sort of cases, where senior executives are involved, that show how important it is... It\u2019s too early to say whether there is going to be marked change though.</p> <h2>Employment lawyer Anna Birtwistle from CM Murray:</h2> <p>While cutting Mr Staley\u2019s pay may outwardly appear to represent a strong response from Barclays, it is difficult to reconcile the Board\u2019s continued confidence in Mr Staley with its stated commitment to whistleblowing. Fostering an open culture of disclosing wrongdoing in the workplace requires top down stewardship and while it may be understandable that Barclays has backed Mr Staley given his successes in post, the bank\u2019s response to Mr Staley\u2019s actions may give mixed messages to its employees and the wider financial services industry about the steadfastness of its commitment to whistleblowing. </p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-58eb6d3fe4b0e0ec04eff8e6\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-04-10T11:39:02.757Z\">12.39pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Staley defends himself in email to staff</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Barclays boss Jes Staley has just sent an email out to all staff defending his actions.

To remove Mr Staley from his role at this juncture would be damaging to further operational progress, with an improvement in return on equity now the key area of focus.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The Body Shop could be one step closer to separating from L\u2019Or\u00e9al this week as bidders for the ethical beauty chain put forward their initial offers. The chain has more than 3,000 stores in 66 countries, and sales and profits have come under pressure amid rising competition and an unhappy alliance between two very different brands. Private equity firms including Apax Partners, CVC and Advent International are thought to be weighing up bids of between \u00a3600m and \u00a3800m for the company, alongside trade buyers including South Korea\u2019s CJ Group, a media, home shopping and pharmaceuticals conglomerate. L\u2019Or\u00e9al, the world\u2019s largest cosmetics company, confirmed in February it had decided \u201cto explore all strategic options\u201d for The Body Shop \u201cto give it the best opportunities and full ability to continue its development\u201d. The first-round bids for The Body Shop are expected before L\u2019Or\u00e9al\u2019s first-quarter results on 18 April and annual meeting two days later. It could mark the end of an unhappy decade for the Sussex-based retailer since founder Dame Anita Roddick sold up to L\u2019Or\u00e9al for \u00a3652m in 2006 \u2013 a move seen as betrayal by some regular shoppers. \u201cIt was like watching your daughter marry the wrong man. We knew before the wedding it would end in tears,\u201d says Mark Constantine, a former Body Shop staffer who now runs fast-growing rival Lush. His business, which now has 931 stores in 49 countries, increased sales by 26% to \u00a3723m last year and pre-tax profits increased 76% to \u00a343.2m as it moved to larger stores and engaged with young shoppers online. And Lush is just one of a much broader spectrum of competitors that The Body Shop now faces, including the likes of Neal\u2019s Yard, L\u2019Occitane, Liz Earle and Chantecaille, which have all expanded in recent years. Meanwhile, many mainstream brands have followed Roddick\u2019s lead, using more natural ingredients and no longer testing on animals. The Body Shop\u2019s chain of stores is also up against rivals such as Space NK and greater competition from clothing chains and department stores that have increased their beauty ranges to offset falling clothing sales. \u201cThis is not a time to have lots of stores,\u201d says a source close to the bidding. The Body Shop\u2019s operating profits dived 38% to \u20ac33.8m (\u00a329m) in the year to 31 December 2016 while sales sank nearly 5% to \u20ac920.8m. The pace of decline stepped up in the final and most important quarter of the year \u2013 sliding by 6.3% in total. The proportion of health and beauty shoppers visiting its stores slipped to 9% last year from 10.4% a year before, according to analysts GlobalData. That poor performance came despite good times for the beauty industry, particularly in the UK, which is currently the fastest-growing retail sector. Sales rose 17.4% between 2011 and 2016, according to GlobalData. Constantine believes The Body Shop has lost out as its most concerned ethical consumers were put off by the association with L\u2019Or\u00e9al, which is owned by the super-rich Bettencourt family and corporate food giant Nestl\u00e9. \u201cYou couldn\u2019t ask for a more boo-hiss villain,\u201d he says. While The Body Shop has worked hard to maintain its ethical credentials, last year launching a series of environmental and community initiatives, the group\u2019s ultimate ownership means it finds it difficult to offer the kind of transparency and integrity that young consumers now demand. \u201cThey have skipped two generations,\u201d Constantine says, adding that young people are sadly unaware of the legacy of Roddick, who set up the business in Brighton in 1976 to help support her two daughters. However, Charlotte Pearce, an analyst at GlobalData, says most shoppers aren\u2019t aware of The Body Shop\u2019s association with L\u2019Or\u00e9al and she doesn\u2019t believe the chain\u2019s ownership has damaged the brand. She believes the decline is the result of dull stores, an unexciting online and social media presence and a lack of innovation in its products. \u201cIt has not really moved on and innovated,\u201d Pearce says. The chain has missed out on key beauty trends, such as contouring, and has an image that is stuck in the 1990s. \u201cThe social media feeds are focused on Body Shop\u2019s ethical history. They need to move away from that and focus on innovation,\u201d she says. One source close to a potential bidder agrees. \u201cIt\u2019s become corporatised and lost some of its zing. Anita sprinkled magic on the brand for years, giving it credibility. The products weren\u2019t that different: it was the brand aura. I\u2019m not sure they can ever recoup that.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>The Body Shop could be one step closer to separating from L\u2019Or\u00e9al this week as bidders for the ethical beauty chain put forward their initial offers.</p> <p>The chain has more than 3,000 stores in 66 countries, and sales and profits have come under pressure amid rising competition and an unhappy alliance between two very different brands.</p> <p>Private equity firms including Apax Partners, CVC and Advent International are thought to be weighing up bids of between \u00a3600m and \u00a3800m for the company, alongside trade buyers including South Korea\u2019s CJ Group, a media, home shopping and pharmaceuticals conglomerate.</p> <p>L\u2019Or\u00e9al, the world\u2019s largest cosmetics company, confirmed in February it had decided \u201cto explore all strategic options\u201d for The Body Shop \u201cto give it the best opportunities and full ability to continue its development\u201d.</p> <p>The first-round bids for The Body Shop are expected before L\u2019Or\u00e9al\u2019s first-quarter results on 18 April and annual meeting two days later. It could mark the end of an unhappy decade for the Sussex-based retailer since founder <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2006/mar/17/retail.money\" title=\"\">Dame Anita Roddick sold up to L\u2019Or\u00e9al for \u00a3652m in 2006</a> \u2013 a move seen as betrayal by some regular shoppers.</p> <p>\u201cIt was like watching your daughter marry the wrong man. We knew before the wedding it would end in tears,\u201d says Mark Constantine, a former Body Shop staffer who now runs fast-growing rival Lush.</p> <p>His business, which now has 931 stores in 49 countries, increased sales by 26% to \u00a3723m last year and pre-tax profits increased 76% to \u00a343.2m as it moved to larger stores and engaged with young shoppers online.</p> <p>And Lush is just one of a much broader spectrum of competitors that The Body Shop now faces, including the likes of Neal\u2019s Yard, L\u2019Occitane, Liz Earle and Chantecaille, which have all expanded in recent years. Meanwhile, many mainstream brands have followed Roddick\u2019s lead, using more natural ingredients and no longer testing on animals.</p> <p>The Body Shop\u2019s chain of stores is also up against rivals such as Space NK and greater competition from clothing chains and department stores that have increased their beauty ranges to offset falling clothing sales. \u201cThis is not a time to have lots of stores,\u201d says a source close to the bidding.</p> <p>The Body Shop\u2019s operating profits dived 38% to \u20ac33.8m (\u00a329m) in the year to 31 December 2016 while sales sank nearly 5% to \u20ac920.8m. The pace of decline stepped up in the final and most important quarter of the year \u2013 sliding by 6.3% in total.</p> <p>The proportion of health and beauty shoppers visiting its stores slipped to 9% last year from 10.4% a year before, according to analysts GlobalData.</p> <p>That poor performance came despite good times for the beauty industry, particularly in the UK, which is currently the fastest-growing retail sector. Sales rose 17.4% between 2011 and 2016, according to GlobalData.</p> <p>Constantine believes The Body Shop has lost out as its most concerned ethical consumers were put off by the association with L\u2019Or\u00e9al, which is owned by the super-rich Bettencourt family and corporate food giant Nestl\u00e9. \u201cYou couldn\u2019t ask for a more boo-hiss villain,\u201d he says.</p> <p>While The Body Shop has worked hard to maintain its ethical credentials, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/feb/13/body-shop-boss-back-to-rainforest-jeremy-schwartz-anita-roddick\" title=\"\">last year launching a series of environmental and community initiatives</a>, the group\u2019s ultimate ownership means it finds it difficult to offer the kind of transparency and integrity that young consumers now demand. \u201cThey have skipped two generations,\u201d Constantine says, adding that young people are sadly unaware of the legacy of Roddick, who set up the business in Brighton in 1976 to help support her two daughters.</p> <p>However, Charlotte Pearce, an analyst at GlobalData, says most shoppers aren\u2019t aware of The Body Shop\u2019s association with L\u2019Or\u00e9al and she doesn\u2019t believe the chain\u2019s ownership has damaged the brand.</p> <p>She believes the decline is the result of dull stores, an unexciting online and social media presence and a lack of innovation in its products.</p> <p>\u201cIt has not really moved on and innovated,\u201d Pearce says. The chain has missed out on key beauty trends, such as contouring, and has an image that is stuck in the 1990s. \u201cThe social media feeds are focused on Body Shop\u2019s ethical history. They need to move away from that and focus on innovation,\u201d she says.</p> <p>One source close to a potential bidder agrees. \u201cIt\u2019s become corporatised and lost some of its zing. Anita sprinkled magic on the brand for years, giving it credibility. The products weren\u2019t that different: it was the brand aura. I\u2019m not sure they can ever recoup that.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "Coal dust released from Adani\u2019s Queensland coal port after Cyclone Debbie appears to have caused \u201cmassive contamination\u201d of sensitive wetlands, an academic expert says. A vast swathe of the Caley Valley wetlands has been blackened by coal-laden water released from nearby Abbot Point port after Debbie\u2019s torrential rains inundated its coal storage facilities last month. Satellite imagery of the coal spill last week prompted an investigation by the Queensland Department of Environment and Heritage Protection (EHP), which said the port operator appeared to have acted in line with a temporary licence to release the excess water. The caveat was that the licence did not \u201cauthorise environmental harm\u201d, an environment department spokeswoman said. Norm Duke, a principal research scientist at James Cook University\u2019s TropWater unit and an expert in diagnosing contamination of wetlands, said an aerial image of the area showed \u201cthere\u2019s undoubtedly going to be environmental harm\u201d. \u201cThe image shows me a massive contamination of an area that I\u2019m very familiar with,\u201d Duke told Guardian Australia. \u201cThat\u2019s not an area they should be dumping their stuff in. \u201cI\u2019m surprised [they were allowed to do so] \u2013 in some ways it would be almost better going into the sea rather than dropping it into somewhere it\u2019s just going to cause long-term damage.\u201d Duke, who has done extensive research on contamination of mangroves from oil spills, said he had \u201cnever seen anything as bad as this for coal dust\u201d. The spread of coal dust over a \u201chuge\u201d area of the wetlands risked creating a \u201cdouble whammy\u201d of harm that would have dire implications for local flora and fauna, from fish and birds to molluscs and crabs, he said. First, the sediment would raise the level of mangroves where \u201cif you change the elevation even by a few millimetres, some plants and animals will not be able to live there because the tidal regime will change dramatically\u201d. This could then be compounded by the potentially toxic effects of coal dust. The extent of both problems could be established almost immediately with site visits, Duke said. But a further problem could emerge months later in the dry season, when fine coal dust could suffocate plants, he said. \u201cWe are looking at something nobody\u2019s going to clean up,\u201d Duke said. The department launched an investigation after it became aware of satellite imagery last Thursday apparently showing sediment-laden water flowing from Abbot Point\u2019s settlement ponds into the adjacent wetland, a spokeswoman said. The investigation was into \u201cwhether there has been any unauthorised releases of water\u201d into the wetlands. \u201cInitial monitoring results indicate releases to Caley Valley wetland were in accordance with\u201d the conditions of a temporary emissions licence [TEL] granted to Abbot Point, which allowed the release of water with up to 100mg per litre of \u201ctotal suspended solids\u201d, she said. \u201cIn the event of major rainfall and flooding, mines and associated sites can apply to EHP for a temporary emissions licence, which is a permit that temporarily relaxes or modifies the conditions of an environmental authority. \u201cA TEL does not authorise environmental harm.\u201d The spokeswoman said the investigation was continuing, \u201cincluding accessing historical satellite imagery to compare wetland colour and depth fluctuations\u201d. A spokesman for Adani said the company believed it had acted \u201cwithin the requirements of the temporary emissions licence\u201d. Peter McCallum of Mackay Conservation Group said the spill in 5,000-hectare wetlands that were home to more than 40,000 shore birds showed \u201cthe lack of capacity Adani has to operate in a sensitive environment\u201d. The group has written to Queensland\u2019s environment minister, Steven Miles, asking how the government intended to rehabilitate the wetlands and whether any prosecutions for environmental damage would follow. The Palaszczuk government came to power in 2015 having promised to scrap an earlier plan to allow Adani to dump dredge spoil from the port expansion on to the Caley Valley. The plan is now to dump spoil on a disused industrial site near the port and the wetlands. Adani has directly controlled the running of the port since September, when it bought out previous operator Glencore. It bought a 99-year lease on the port in 2011 and says it has invested more than $1.8bn in the existing terminal.",
