Last week prosperous John Lewis was grumbling that it might have to restructure staff benefits, including the annual bonus, to pay for George Osborne\u2019s \u201cnational living wage\u201d of \u00a37.20 an hour for over-25s from April. Now, travelling in the opposite direction, comes supposedly stricken Morrisons, which is lifting basic pay by 20% to \u00a38.20 hour, a rate greater than the living wage as defined by campaigners. There are a few subclauses to Morrisons\u2019 improvement. A rate of time-and-a-half for Sunday shifts will be abolished, though affected staff will not be out of pocket as the new system is adopted. A variety of supplements, for butchers for example, are being reorganised into a single rate. And paid breaks will no longer exist. Those riders shouldn\u2019t deflect from the basic fact that Morrisons will be paying a lot more than most of its supermarket rivals. Usdaw, the union, calls it \u201ca big step forward\u201d and recommends members give a thumbs-up. What\u2019s going on? The first factor is specific to Morrisons. The new chief executive, David Potts, seems to be borrowing from the Archie Norman manual of how to revive a struggling supermarket chain. At Asda in the 1990s, Norman handed out share options to all, hoping to create a spirit of ownership. It worked, and those options paid out handsomely when Wal-Mart bought the business in 1999. Share options wouldn\u2019t work so well at today\u2019s Morrisons. Nobody would seriously think it possible to achieve an Asda-style surge in the share price; that business was almost bust when Norman arrived in 1991. So Potts will have to rely on pay. At a cost of \u00a340m, it looks a sound commercial bet. The second factor is that the labour market is clearly tightening for shop workers, a welcome development. In fact, if you are on shop floor at Tesco and Sainsbury\u2019s, you\u2019d be asking your bosses why you can\u2019t have parity with staff at Morrsions and Lidl. Why not, indeed? Glencore should keep things simple Glencore has been God\u2019s gift to investment bankers ever since Ivan Glasenberg decided to inflict the mining-cum-trading house on the public market. There were fees for rounding up buyers for the overpriced stock market debut in 2011. There was $140m to share around in the merger with Xstrata in 2013. There have been fees for smaller deals, such as the $6bn purchase of agricultural outfit Viterra. And, a fortnight ago, there was a \u00a31.6bn placing. But here comes Citigroup, recipient of some of those fees, with a fresh angle. \u201cWe believe that in the event the equity market continues to express its unwillingness to value the business fairly, the company management should take the company private,\u201d say the investment bank\u2019s analysts. One has to admire the chutzpah, especially the final flourish that, once Glencore has been restructured in private, there could be \u201ca potential flotation of the industrial business occurring further down the track\u201d. Maybe that mining business could be called Xstrata and the whirligig could start all over again. Come on, this buyout idea is for the birds. Those of us obliged to own a slice of Glencore via our pension schemes dearly wish Glasenberg had stayed private all along, but the last thing this over-borrowed company needs now is another layer of buyout debt. One should never underestimate Glasenberg\u2019s appetite for financial adventure, of course, but, with the shares sitting at 80p v the float price of 530p, one would hope $1m-a-year chairman Tony Hayward is telling the great trader to keep things simple. That means flogging a few assets at half-decent prices to get borrowings under control. Citi, more soberly, suggests the agricultural marketing division could fetch $10.5bn \u2013 that would be a start. At least BHP Billiton is in the disclosure game Other miners have other things to do. BHP Billiton has published an analysis of how its business will perform when, or if, policymakers get serious about measures to combat global warming. Its timing proved good: in the evening Mark Carney, governor of the Bank of England, was on the same subject, calling for better information on the carbon intensities of corporate assets. It\u2019s hard to know if BHP\u2019s document would satisfy Carney\u2019s criteria. Probably not: more hard data, and fewer comforting words to shareholders on the outlook for profits, may be required. But at least BHP is in the disclosure game.

    "webTitle": "Morrisons to pay shop floor staff more than Osborne's living wage", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "It is little more than two months since George Osborne stood at the despatch box and declared: \u201cBritain deserves a pay rise.\u201d On Tuesday the UK\u2019s fourth largest supermarket became the latest employer to take the hint \u2013 and stump up a pay deal better than the chancellor had in mind. Morrisons is to increase pay for 90,000 shop floor staff to \u00a38.20 an hour from March. That is above Osborne\u2019s \u00a37.20 \u201cnational living wage\u201d announced in the July budget and even tops the living wage calculated by independent campaigners. The pay rise \u2013 a hefty 20% increase from Morrisons\u2019 current minimum wage for shop floor staff of \u00a36.83 an hour \u2013 will apply to staff of all ages. Some of the increase will be offset by changes to benefits - including the end of extra pay for Sundays and paid breaks - but the like-for-like pay rise will still be a considerable 13%. \u201cWe guarantee no worker will be worse off,\u201d a spokesman said. Morrisons said the move would cost \u00a340m. The deal, negotiated with shopworkers\u2019 union Usdaw, will be subject to a workers\u2019 vote on 12 November. David Potts, chief executive of Morrisons, said: \u201cWe have been listening to our colleagues who told us they want their pay to be more competitive and simpler. By paying a significantly higher hourly rate, we are recognising the contribution of our excellent staff, who are so important to the revival of Morrisons.\u201d The increase, which makes Morrisons the highest payer of the UK\u2019s four biggest supermarkets, comes after German discounter Lidl set the pace earlier this month by agreeing to pay 9,000 staff at least \u00a38.20 an hour. Analysts said the struggling Morrisons, which is closing a number of stores after profits halved last year, could benefit from boosting morale and helping to retain experienced shopfloor staff. \u201cWe would imagine that the majority of Morrisons colleagues will be absolutely cock-a-hoop about the stepped upward adjustment in pay,\u201d said Clive Black, an analyst at Shore Capital. He said improving staff morale had played a key role in some previous retail turnarounds. But Morrisons isn\u2019t the only retailer that has rolled out a chunky pay rise this year. After years of falling real wages as a result of the financial crisis, campaigners piled pressure on employers this year by highlighting that the government was topping up low pay through the benefits system. They targeted the annual shareholder meetings of major retailers, including Morrisons, Next, Sainsbury\u2019s and Tesco, with protests to demand the adoption of the full living wage. Then Osborne\u2019s new national minimum wage, which takes effect next April, but only for over-25s, further highlighted the issue of low pay. This month Sainsbury\u2019s increased its standard rate for shopfloor staff by 4% to \u00a37.36 an hour, Amazon staff pay increased to \u00a37.20 an hour. In March, The Co-op committed to raising pay by 8.5% over two years to about \u00a37.30 an hour. John Hannett, general secretary of Usdaw, said retailers were realising they needed to tackle low pay: \u201cThere is a mood among employers that they don\u2019t want to be the lowest.\u201d Retail recruitment experts said retailers were realising they had to offer better pay to get and keep good staff in a difficult and fast-changing market. \u201cCustomers are getting a lot smarter and expect a good experience in stores. They are expecting a lot and that is being driven by social media,\u201d said Oliver Nevel, director of retail and fashion at recruitment firm Michael Page. He said would-be staff were as well informed as shoppers \u2013 with specialist websites enabling them to review pay and conditions at different businesses. Shop staff also switch jobs more regularly than other workers and will move fast to better payers. Gill Owen, from the Living Wage Foundation, said: \u201cThis is wonderful news from Morrisons. Lidl\u2019s announcement has prompted a review of pay practices and it shows consumers are beginning to recognise that the living wage is an important mark of a responsible business. We hope more will follow in Morrisons\u2019 footsteps.\u201d The foundation recommends paying \u00a37.85 outside London and \u00a39.15 in London, but will announce new rates at the start of November. Its figures are based on research by the Centre for Research in Social Policy at Loughborough University into the income that households require to afford an acceptable standard of living. Lidl said it would match the foundation\u2019s new levels if they were higher than its current plan. The only accredited national high street retailer is Oliver Bonas, the fashion and jewellery chain with 44 stores. Burberry has also adopted the living wage and Ikea has pledged to pay it to its 9,000 employees from April.

    "webTitle": "Glencore shares rebound after company bids to ease finance concerns", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Shares in mining and commodities group Glencore rebounded on Tuesday after the embattled firm attempted to calm growing concerns about its finances and analysts said that management could take it private. In an unscheduled statement, Glencore said it was \u201coperationally and financially robust\u201d after volatile trading in the company\u2019s shares. The statement drove up shares in Glencore by 20% at one stage, although they fell back slightly to close up by nearly 17% at 80.25p. On Monday, shares in Glencore fell by 29% \u2013 one of the biggest daily falls for a FTSE 100 company \u2013 after analysts at investment bank Investec warned that the value of Glencore could evaporate if commodity prices stay at current levels. However, Glencore responded with a robust statement, claiming it had \u201cno debt covenants and continues to retain strong lines of credit and secure access to funding\u201d. Glencorealso won support from analysts at Citi, the bank that helped the company to float in 2011. Citi claimed the recent slump in the commodity group\u2019s share price was overdone and that management should consider buying the business and taking it back to private ownership. Despite the rebound in its shares, Glencore\u2019s share price is still 85% lower than when the company floated in 2011. It has fallen by three quarters so far this year due to concerns about the Chinese economy, falling commodity prices and the company\u2019s debt levels. The share price slump means that Glencore\u2019s boss, Ivan Glasenberg \u2013 whose stake was valued at around \u00a36bn when the company floated \u2013 is no longer a paper billionaire on the basis of his Glencore stake alone. Nonetheless, Glencore was further boosted on Tuesday as the price of copper steadied. The benchmark three-month copper on the London Metal Exchange ended up 0.1% at $4,970 a tonne, although this remains close to the six-year low of $4,915.50 hit in late August. China uses almost half the world\u2019s copper and fears of an economic slowdown have badly affected the price of the metal. Heath Jansen at Citi said that even if copper hit $4,000 a metric tonne and other raw material prices stayed stable, Glencore should still post annual profits of roughly $7.5bn (\u00a34.9bn). The analysts said: \u201cIn the event the equity market continues to express its unwillingness to value the business fairly, the company management should take the company private, whereby restructuring measures can be taken easily and quickly.\u201d Citi said that Glencore had resources of $12bn to fund the group, including $6.5bn of cash after a $2.5bn share placing this month, which was designed to ease fears about the company\u2019s future. Glencore backed up Citi\u2019s comments by insisting in its statement that it had access to sufficient funds The company said in a statement: \u201cGlencore has taken proactive steps to position our company to withstand current commodity market conditions. Our business remains operationally and financially robust \u2013 we have positive cash flow, good liquidity and absolutely no solvency issues.\u201d Earlier this month Glencore announced plans to reduce its debt by $10.2bn through a share placing, suspending dividend payments, halting operations at two African mines and selling assets. \u201cWe are getting on and delivering a suite of measures to reduce our debt levels by up to $10.2bn,\u201d said Glencore. \u201cGlencore has no debt covenants and continues to retain strong lines of credit and secure access to funding thanks to long-term relationships we have with the banks. \u201cWe remain focused on running efficient, low-cost and safe operations and are confident the medium- and long-term fundamentals of the commodities we produce and market remain strong into the future.\u201d Analysts at investment bank UBS also said that Glencore shares had been \u201cheavily oversold\u201d, although staff at Jefferies warned that the risks of investing in Glencore were \u201cclearly very high\u201d. UBS added: \u201cGlencore is now under pressure to strengthen its balance sheet via asset sales or a capital injection, and time is of the essence.\u201d",

The debts of non-financial firms in emerging market economies quadrupled, from $4tn (\u00a32.6tn) in 2004 to well over $18tn in 2014, according to the IMF\u2019s twice-yearly Global Financial Stability Report. This borrowing binge has taken business debt as a share of economic output from less than half, in 2004, to almost 75%. China\u2019s firms have led the spree, but businesses in other countries, including Turkey, Chile and Brazil, have also ramped up their debts \u2014 and could prove vulnerable as interest rates rise. With the US Federal Reserve expected to raise interest rates in the coming months, the IMF warns that emerging market governments should ready themselves for an increase in corporate failures, as firms struggle to meet sharply higher borrowing costs. That could create distress among the local banks who have bought much of this new debt, causing them in turn to rein in lending, in a \u201cvicious cycle\u201d reminiscent of the credit crisis of 2008-09. \u201cShocks to the corporate sector could quickly spill over to the financial sector and generate a vicious cycle as banks curtail lending. Decreased loan supply would then lower aggregate demand and collateral values, further reducing access to finance and thereby economic activity, and in turn, increasing losses to the financial sector,\u201d the IMF warns. Its economists find that the sharp increase in borrowing has been driven largely by international factors, including the historically low interest rates and quantitative easing unleashed by central banks in the US, Japan and Europe, as they have sought to rekindle growth in the wake of the sub-prime crisis. \u201cMonetary policy has been exceptionally accommodative across major advanced economies. Firms in emerging markets have faced greater incentives and opportunities to increase leverage as a result of the ensuing unusually favourable global financial conditions,\u201d the IMF says. It also warns that borrowing appears to have risen fastest in sectors that would be most vulnerable to an economic downturn, including construction, and oil and gas; and that some of the heaviest borrowers have taken out debts in foreign currencies, which would leave them doubly exposed if rising rates coincide with a depreciation. \u201cEmerging markets must prepare for the adverse domestic stability implications of global financial tightening,\u201d the IMF says. The IMF published the warning as the world\u2019s finance ministers and central bankers prepare to gather for its annual meeting in Lima, Peru, next month. Its analysis underscores the backlash that the Federal Reserve could face if it starts to tighten policy and unleashes chaos in emerging economies. Janet Yellen, the Fed\u2019s chair, made clear that its recent decision to delay a long-planned increase in rates was a result of the turmoil in emerging markets, in particular China. The IMF has called on the Fed to delay policy \u201clift-off\u201d, because of the potential impact on other economies. Andy Haldane, the Bank of England\u2019s chief economist, warned recently that the world could be facing the latest leg in a financial crisis \u201ctrilogy\u201d, that began in US mortgage markets, flared up again in the eurozone, and has now shifted to emerging markets. In a separate chapter of the Global Financial Stability Report, also published on Tuesday, the IMF urged regulators to take action to reduce the risks that liquidity in financial markets could evaporate, creating lurching swings in prices. \u201cSince market liquidity is prone to suddenly drying up, policymakers should adopt pre-emptive strategies to cope with such shifts in market liquidity,\u201d it says. Some investors have been warning that changes in regulation, and in the structure of markets since the global credit crisis, have increased the danger that markets could seize up in future. \u201cIn recent years, factors such as investors\u2019 higher risk appetite and low interest rates have been masking growing underlying fragilities in market liquidity,\u201d said Gaston Gelos, chief of the global financial stability analysis division at the IMF. He called for regulators to continue reforms to boost liquidity, such as enforcing equal access to electronic trading platforms; but he warned that \u201ccentral banks and financial supervisors need to be prepared for episodes of liquidity breakdowns.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Volkswagen is poised to recall up to 11m vehicles as the carmaker prepares its response to the emissions scandal that has rocked the automotive industry. Matthias M\u00fcller, the new chief executive of VW, told a meeting of the company\u2019s top 1,000 managers that a comprehensive plan has been drawn up to ensure vehicles fitted with a defeat device meet emissions standards. This plan will now be submitted to regulators, and customers will be contacted \u201cin the next few days\u201d, M\u00fcller said. VW motorists will be told to visit a local mechanic to have their vehicles refitted. VW revealed its plan as Fitch, the credit rating agency, said the scandal could be a \u201cturning point\u201d for the global car industry and have \u201cprofound and lasting repercussions\u201d. M\u00fcller told leading staff at VW\u2019s headquarters in Wolfsburg, Germany, that the business was \u201cfacing the severest test in its history\u201d and \u201ca long trudge and a lot of hard work\u201d. The company has brought in Jones Day, a US law firm, to lead an internal investigation into the scandal. \u201cWe will only be able to make progress in steps and there will be setbacks,\u201d said M\u00fcller, who added that the scandal must be cleaned up \u201cruthlessly\u201d. The recall would be one of the biggest ever in the automotive industry, ahead of the 10m recalled by Toyota in 2010 over a fault with its accelerator pedal. VW has admitted that 11m diesel vehicles worldwide were fitted with defeat devices and all of them are likely to require a technical fix. Out of these affected, 5m are Volkswagen-branded cars, including the sixth-generation Golf, the seventh-generation Passat and the first-generation Tiguan. The other vehicles include 2.1m Audis, 1.2m Skodas, 700,000 Seats, and 1.8m light commercial vehicles. German authorities have given VW a deadline of 7 October to produce a plan for the 11m vehicles affected. In a statement, VW said it would set up websites for every country affected to keep customers informed about what they need to do. VW\u2019s share price has fallen by almost 40% since allegations first emerged in the US that it had cheated emissions tests on diesel cars. The company faces fines of up to $18bn (\u00a311.9bn) and also one of the biggest legal claims in history from customers and shareholders around the world. Prosecutors have also opened an investigation into Martin Winterkorn, the former boss of the world\u2019s second biggest carmaker, over the emissions scandal. Winterkorn is the subject of a preliminary inquiry by prosecutors in Braunschweig, close to VW\u2019s headquarters, into possible fraud relating to the sale of vehicles with manipulated emissions data. The first research into customers\u2019 reactions to the scandal suggest the VW brand has been damaged. YouGov said that a survey of 2,000 German consumers found VW\u2019s image has been weakened significantly and the brand is now seen as no better than Smart, the small-car brand owned by Daimler. Meanwhile, two-thirds of financial institutions say they would not invest in VW for the next six months owing to concerns about the impact of the crisis, according to advisory group Evercore. After VW admitted for the first time that commercial vehicles were part of the 11m fitted with defeat devices, the British Vehicle Rental and Leasing Association (BVRLA) said there would \u201cundoubtedly\u201d be some impact on commercial fleets. The trade body said its members and their customers were \u201cconcerned as to the potential ramifications [the VW scandal] will have for the UK fleet sector\u201d. Its members \u2013 vehicle rental and leasing companies \u2013 own and operate more than 3m cars, 80% of which are diesels. Volkswagen Financial Services is one of the association\u2019s biggest members. The BVRLA said: \u201cNumerous investigations are now underway, so we will be watching closely to see if the scope widens further to include other manufacturers and vehicles. It is difficult to comment any further about potential impacts until we have a better understanding of how governments, manufacturers and customers react.\u201d The association has been calling for some time for the introduction of more accurate, real-world testing regimes for both CO2 and NOx (carbon dioxide and nitrogen oxides). Analysts at Fitch said the VW crisis was likely to affect the entire automotive industry, with petrol cars potentially enjoying a revival in Europe and greater investment being poured into electric cars. Fitch said: \u201cRegulators will reassess the timeline to reach planned, more stringent emission limit targets and could review the targets themselves. Test protocols will undoubtedly also be toughened and the move towards real driving emission testing cycles will accelerate. \u201cThe scandal could accelerate the underlying growth of vehicles with alternative powertrains, including fuel cells, electric and hybrid engines. It could also lead to a shift back towards petrol engines in Europe, where diesel engines now account for more than half of sales.\u201d The agency added that a shift away from diesel would have a bigger impact on European manufacturers than on US or Asian competitors. However, the consequences of the scandal could spread to the entire transportation sector if it fundamentally affects consumers\u2019 and regulators\u2019 attitudes towards cars and pollution, it said.",

      "bodyText": "The IMF has warned of a possible new financial crisis, particularly in emerging markets, when central banks start raising interest rates. The US of course could well make a move in that direction later this year. Here\u2019s our economics editor Larry Elliott\u2019s take on the IMF\u2019s comments: The IMF\u2019s warning is timely. In recent years investors have piled into emerging markets in a pretty indiscriminate fashion looking for higher returns than have been available in the west. They haven\u2019t looked too hard at the strengths and weaknesses of individual countries or companies.... The Fund fears that there could be a wave of corporate failures as western countries begin the process of returning policy to a more normal setting. Financial markets think this will begin later this year with an interest rate increase from the US Federal Reserve, a likely catalyst for the crisis in emerging markets the Fund clearly fears. If that proves to be the case, the west will feel the impact: losses in the financial sector and deflation as falling currencies make goods from developing countries cheaper. Attempts to \u201cnormalise\u201d interest rates may prove short lived. Larry\u2019s full analysis is here: On that note, it\u2019s time to close up for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. Following Monday\u2019s stock market rout, prompted by growing fears for the global economy and a slump in commodity prices, European markets failed to regain any ground amid continuing volatility. One bright spot was Glencore. After being hammered on Monday, the mining and trading group recovered nearly 17%, helped by the company saying it was \u201coperationally and financially robust\u201d and a Citi note suggesting the company could be taken private if the slide in metal prices continued. But this revival did nothing to help the FTSE 100, which fell to its lowest level since 24 August. Other European markets slipped lower, but outperformed the UK benchmark which was hit by a 12% fall in building materials group Wolseley as it cut its revenue forecasts, and weakness in housebuilders. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished down 49.62 points or 0.83% at 5909.24 Germany\u2019s Dax dipped 0.35% to 9450.40 France\u2019s Cac closed 0.31% lower at 4343.73 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB fell 0.16% to 20, 726.75 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended virtually unchanged at 9393.9 In Greece, the Athens market slipped 0.67% to 650.33 There was little help from the US markets, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average sliding from positive to negative and back again. At the moment it is down 23 points or 0.15%. The VW emissions scandal could prove a turning point for the whole automotive industry around the world, according to ratings agency Fitch, beyond the immediate effect on the company itself. It could see regulators review emission test targets, accelerate the growth of electric and hybrid vehicles and even see a shift back to petrol engines. A shift away from diesel would have a bigger impact on European carmakers than their US or Asian rivals. Fitch said: The Volkswagen emissions test scandal could prove a turning point for the auto industry worldwide, Fitch Ratings says. It could prompt profound and lasting repercussions far beyond the group\u2019s own credit profile. It is too early to assess the full implications for automotive manufacturers, suppliers and other industry constituents, but we expect the whole sector to be affected to various degrees. Regulators will reassess the timeline to reach planned more stringent emission limit targets and could review the targets themselves. Test protocols will undoubtedly also be toughened and the move towards real driving emission testing cycles will accelerate. The scandal could accelerate the underlying growth of vehicles with alternative powertrains, including fuel cells, electric and hybrid engines. It could also lead to a shift back towards petrol engines in Europe, where diesel engines now account for more than half of sales. A shift away from diesel would have a bigger impact on European manufacturers than on their US or Asian rivals. In particular, it may hit manufacturers of small diesel-engine cars harder than premium manufacturers, which have greater price elasticity to absorb higher costs. R&amp;D investments are likely to rise as manufacturers face more stringent rules and new test regimes. There is also the potential for business plan reassessment and material investment write-downs if manufacturers have to reassess product pipelines, particularly upcoming engines. Specialist suppliers of emission control technology could initially be hurt by a shift away from diesel, while those with expertise in turbocharging and downsized petrol engines could be at an advantage. More broadly, the whole transportation sector could be affected if this emission test crisis fundamentally affects consumers and regulators\u2019 attitude towards cars, driving and pollution. Volkswagen and regulators\u2019 current and future measures in reaction to the crisis will be crucial to mitigating or, conversely, accelerating the impact of this scandal on the group\u2019s own credit profile and broader industry transformations. The report is here: Fitch: Volkswagen Crisis May Have Lasting Impact Across Sector Volkswagen has given more details of its plans to refit vehicles affected by the emissions scandal. It says it plans to refit some five million diesel vehicles with EA 189 EU5 engines, including certain Golf, Passat and Tiguan models. The full statement says: Volkswagen AG is announcing its action plan to correct the emissions characteristics of diesel vehicles. In a first step, the customers affected will be informed that the emissions characteristics of their vehicles will be corrected in the near future. All vehicles are technically safe and roadworthy. Under the action plan, Volkswagen and the other Group brands whose vehicles are affected will present the technical solutions and measures to the responsible authorities in October. Customers with these vehicles will be kept informed over the coming weeks and months. All of the Group brands affected will set up national websites to update customers on developments. An internal evaluation on Friday established that a service procedure is required for some five million vehicles from the Volkswagen Passenger Cars brand out of a total eleven million Group vehicles worldwide. These vehicles from certain models and model years (such as the sixth generation Volkswagen Golf, the seventh generation Volkswagen Passat or the first generation Volkswagen Tiguan) are fitted with Type EA 189 diesel engines. In Spain, VW has reportedly agreed to repay subsidies given by the state for purchasing energy efficient cars, in the wake of its admission it cheated diesel emission tests. Spain offered subsidies of \u20ac1,000 when people bought supposedly green cars, but in a statement the country\u2019s industry ministry said it would ask for the money back from VW not consumers, Reuters says. Here\u2019s a list courtesy of Pension Partners of easing measures taken by central banks so far this year, up to and including today\u2019s surprise interest rate cut in India: Vodafone\u2019s chief executive and finance director have spent nearly \u00a31m between them to top up their stakes in the mobile phone company. Chief executive Vittorio Colao bought 260,000 shares at 209.05p each, while chief financial officer Nick Read acquired 180,000 shares at the same price. The purchases came after news that a planned asset swap with Liberty Global had fallen through, sending Vodafone\u2019s shares lower. But the investment has got off to a bad start - Vodafone\u2019s shares are currently at 205.6p, down 1.6p on the day so far. There has been much talk about the effect the VW emissions scandal could have on the German car industry and indeed on the country\u2019s economy as a whole. But economy minister Sigmar Gabriel has said the scandal would not harm the economy as long as VW dealt with it promptly and comprehensively. He told reporters (quote from Reuters): It\u2019s up to the politicians to try to ensure that the jobs of the company\u2019s 600,000 global employees...are not at risk. US consumer confidence figures have come in stronger than expected for September, which will not doubt prompt more suggestions that the Federal Reserve may indeed raise interest rates before the end of the year. The Conference Board\u2019s index rose from 101.5 in August to 103, up from the expected 96.1: After a wobbly start - up slightly, down, now up again - the Dow Jones Industrial Average is now up 31 points. US markets have moved ahead in early trading after Monday\u2019s sell-off, but it is not exactly a convincing rebound. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up around 10 points or 0.09%, while the S&amp;P 500 is 0.15% better. Rising global interest rates could prompt a new credit crunch in emerging markets, as businesses that have ridden the wave of cheap money to load up on debt are pushed into crisis, the International Monetary Fund has warned. The debts of non-financial firms in emerging market economies quadrupled, \u201cfrom $4tn (\u00a32.6tn) in 2004 to well over $18tn in 2014\u201d, according to the IMF\u2019s twice-yearly Global Financial Stability Report. The full story is here: Back with VW and Belgium has argued the company should not face legal action because of its cheating of emissions tests: Global stock markets have hit their lowest levels since September 2013, following this morning\u2019s rout in Asia. The MSCI all-country index of world shares nudged a two-year low last night, after Wall Street retreated. And the losses in Japan (-4%), China (-2%) and Hong Kong (-3%) today mean it has fallen further: In Europe, the FTSE 100 is still in the red too - currently down 21 points or 0.3% at 5938. German and French markets are now in the green, though, after the EC\u2019s eurozone confidence hit a four-year high. FXTM Research Analyst Lukman Otunuga says the markets remain edgy: Anxiety continues to ripple through the financial markets as global developments concerning the lack of clarity on the timing of a US interest rate hike, anxieties over China entering a deep economic downturn, emerging market weakness and continual growth concerns in Europe, Japan and Asia are all weighing on global sentiment. European investors are now looking to Wall Street, where the Dow is tipped to rise by around 0.5% after losing 2% yesterday. Here\u2019s the full statement from Glencore: Glencore has taken proactive steps to position our company to withstand current commodity market conditions. Our business remains operationally and financially robust \u2013 we have positive cash flow, good liquidity and absolutely no solvency issues. We are getting on and delivering a suite of measures to reduce our debt levels by up to US$10.2 billion. Glencore has no debt covenants and continues to retain strong lines of credit and secure access to funding \u200e thanks to long term relationships we have with the banks. We remain focused on running efficient, low cost and safe operations and are confident the medium and long-term fundamentals of the commodities we produce and market remain strong into the future. No shocks in the latest US housing report -- prices in the 20 largest US cities rose by 5% year-on-year in July: Newsflash: Glencore has just declared that it remains \u201coperationally and financially robust\u201d. The mining and commodity player made the comments in a statement designed to calm fears over its financial robustness. A spokesman said: \u201cGlencore has no debt covenants and continues to retain strong lines of credit and secure access to funding,\u201d (debt covenants are agreements between a company and its lender which prevent it from breaching certain financial limits) This has pushed its shares a little higher. They\u2019re now up 13.5% at 77.8p, meaning they have recovered half of Monday\u2019s slump. If you own one of the 11 million Volkswagen cars designed to evade emission testing, you may hear from the company shortly: Germany\u2019s return to negative inflation raises the chances that prices across the eurozone are falling again. We find out for sure tomorrow.... Deflation alert! Germany\u2019s inflation rate has turned negative, for the first time since January. The German harmonised consumer prices index fell by 0.2% year-on-year this month, according to new data from the Federal Statistics Office. Economists had expected the CPI to be unchanged; this negative reading could intensify calls for the European Central Bank to increases its QE programme: Update: This is the \u2018harmonised\u2019 German inflation data, adjusted to be comparable with other eurozone countries. The unharmonised CPI showed that prices were flat year-on-year (ie, an inflation rate of 0.0%) In London, the FTSE 100 index has climbed back from its early lows, thanks to Glencore (currently up 8.7%). But the Footsie is still down by 31 points, or 0.5%, and on track for its lowest close since August 24 (when the markets were spooked by China). Some calm has returned, with the futures market suggesting that Wall Street may manage a small rally after Monday\u2019s selloff. Jasper Lawler of CMC Markets says traders are still skittish: Short-covering has prompted a dead-cat bounce across the commodities space but there isn\u2019t the confidence to invest in some of the less beaten down areas of the market. FT Lex writer Joseph Cotterill isn\u2019t convinced by Citi\u2019s proposal that Glencore\u2019s management should take the company off the stock market (see earlier post for the details). As he points out, it wouldn\u2019t reduce Glencore\u2019s net debt, and thus its obligations to existing bondholders...... Our friends at the Economist are concerned by events in the financial markets: The Volkswagen emissions scandal has drifted to Spain today. El Pais is reporting that five VW brands \u2013 Audi, Seat, Skoda, Volkswagen and Volkswagen Commercial vehicles \u2013 have pulled 3,320 vehicles from sale, while the crisis is investigated. Separately, Seat\u2019s Spain arm has just announced that it made 700,000 cars with rigged engines, which would have evaded emissions testing. One of Glencore\u2019s larger shareholders has uttered the L-word. Legal &amp; General\u2019s CEO, Nigel Wilson, told Bloomberg TV this morning that Glencore has reached a \u201cquasi-Lehman moment\u201d, where speculation over its viability is fuelling the crisis gripping the company. Wilson argued that Glencore\u2019s managements need to respond to claims that its shares could become worthless unless commodity prices recover. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of noise and there\u2019s not enough signalling.\u201d \u201cThat lack of information causes a huge amount of uncertainty at Glencore, which is having a massive contagion effect across the world.\u201d More here: Glencore Must Stem Rumors, Stop Lehman-Like Moment, L&amp;G Says Glencore\u2019s woes have certainly contributed to the nervousness in the markets this week. But that\u2019s not just based on a lack of information. It\u2019s basically because Glencore holds $30bn of net debt, twice its market capitalisation(!), in an environment where iron ore, copper, coal and oil prices are all weak..... Oher an Global growth fears are dragging commodity prices down this morning. Platinum is leading the selloff, hitting its lowest price in six years. That\u2019s partly due to the Volkswagen emission crisis, which could hurt demand for platinum-based catalytic converters used to clean up diesel cars. The copper price has hit a one-month low, reflecting concerns about demand from China. Business confidence across the eurozone has hit a four-year high, but the public are less upbeat. The European Commission has reported that industrial firms, service group and retailers across the eurozone are all more confident this month, pushing its measure of economic sentiment to the highest since 2011. Economic sentiment rose in Italy (+3.4), Germany (+1.9), the Netherlands (+1.2) and France (+0.9), offsetting a small decline in Spain (-0.9). The easing of the Greek debt crisis this summer may have cheered eurozone companies. Consumers, though, are less upbeat, given the storm clouds gathering in the global economy. The EC says: While consumers were more upbeat on questions relating to their personal finances (expected financial situation, future savings), their views on macro-economic developments (future general economic situation, future unemployment) clouded over. Citigroup has proposed an innovative solution to Glencore\u2019s crisis -- the company\u2019s managers could take it private again. In a new research note, Citi analysts argue that the 40% slump in Glencore\u2019s share price in the last few weeks was \u201coverdone\u201d. Glencore could easily sell assets to cover the shortfall in revenue from commodity mining and trading, Citi argues. And if investors aren\u2019t convinced, founder Ivan Glasenberg and co could simply take the problem off their hands. Citi says: \u201cIn the event the equity market continues to express its unwillingness to value the business fairly, the company management should take the company private, whereby restructuring measures can be taken easily and quickly.\u201d That would be quite a move; Glencore only floated four years ago at 530p per share, making Glasenberg a multi-billionaire. They have fallen steadily since, slumping to 68p last night, so anyone who took part in the IPO is already nursing major losses. Citi are close to Glencore, having worked with the company on several deals including its flotation in 2011. So this may reflect the thinking at Glencore\u2019s HQ in Zug, Switzerland. This note may have helped spark the rebound in Glencore\u2019s shares today -- they\u2019re now up 10% today at 75p. Britain\u2019s housing sector is heating up, according to new lending data just released. A total of 71,030 new mortgages were agreed in August, more than expected, and the highest total in 18 months. And the total amount lent rose by \u00a33.4bn, the biggest increase since May 2008. That suggests the housing market is strengthening, which may increase the chances of UK interest rates rising in the coming months (although there\u2019s plenty of reasons for caution, including zero inflation) Here\u2019s our round-up of the Asian selloff: Traders in Asia are catching their breath after a tough trading session. In Hong Kong, the Hang Seng index has just closed 3% lower, with every share losing ground. And China\u2019s Shanghai index has shed almost 2%, following Japan\u2019s 4% slide (see earlier post) Stocks were buffeted by a cocktail of bad news -- from Glencore\u2019s Monday slump and the wider commodities selloff, to the Volkswagen crisis and general worries over the global economy. Volkswagen is being banished from Dow Jones\u2019s index of companies with responsible environmental, social and governance policies, Bloomberg\u2019s Caroline Hyde flags up: Volkswagen shares are leading the fallers in Germany again, down 3.5% in early trading. The latest news is that Swedish prosecutors are considering launching an investigation into VW; a reminder of just how widespread this crisis could become. Meet the new selloff, same as the old selloff: All the main European markets are down again, extending yesterday\u2019s selloff. They\u2019re heading towards the lows hit in late August, triggered by the turmoil in China. If it looks like a rout and smells like a rout then it probably is one, says Mike van Dulken of Accendo Markets. He blames the usual suspects - global growth fears, China, the commodity slowdown, anxiety that the US Federal Reserve might raise interest rates soon.... But there\u2019s also politics to worry about: On the geopolitical front, speeches by Obama and Putin at the UN yesterday highlighted the difficulties and strained relationships facing world leaders in coordinating efforts to calm things in the Middle East and Syria in particular. Building materials and plumbing firm Wolseley is leading the selloff in London today, after warning that market conditions are tough. The London stock market has just opened....and shares are dropping. The FTSE 100 index has lost 62 points, or around 1%, to 5892. That\u2019s its lowest level since markets were roiled by the \u201cGreat Fall of China\u201d a month ago. There\u2019s only one riser....and it\u2019s Glencore! Its shares are up by 8%, or five whole pennies, at 74p, clawing back a little of Monday\u2019s 29% slump. It\u2019s early days, though.... India\u2019s central bank has responded to fears of a global downturn by cutting interest rates. The Reserve Bank of India surprised analysts by slicing 50 basis points off its main refinancing rate, to 6.75% from 7.25%. Only one economist had predicted the move, which takes borrowing costs down to a four-year low. Governor Raghuram Rajan explained that inflationary pressures are easing, in the face of slowing global growth. \u201cThe weakening of global activity since our last review suggests that commodity prices will remain contained for a while.\u201d. Bloomberg has more details. Australia\u2019s stock market has also fallen sharply overnight. The main ASX index shed almost 4%, led by heavy declines in the mining and energy sector. Markets are falling because investors fear a global recession, says Steven Leung, a director at UOB Kay Hian in Hong Kong. Leung warned (via Reuters): \u201cIf you look at Japan ... its economy is in bad shape. And economic situation is not good in Europe, either.\u201d Asian stock markets have already been hit hard today, falling to their lowest levels since 2012. Japan\u2019s Nikkei slumped by 4%, or 714 points, to close at 16930. That\u2019s an eight-month low, with every share down today. Traders were alarmed by Monday\u2019s selloff in Europe - particularly Glencore\u2019s 29% tumble - and in New York. The news that a Japanese shipping firm called Daiichi Chuo Kisen Kaisha had filed for protection from creditors also spooked Tokyo. It had suffered from the decline in dry freight, as demand for iron ore, copper etc has slumped. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. City traders would be advised to pack a tin hat alongside their lunch boxes today, as worries over the global economy grip the markets again. The European stock markets are all expected to slide this morning, as the City hunkers down in the face of volatility, fears over China\u2019s slowdown, and angst over the impact of higher US interest rates. Chris Weston of IG says that darkness is descending on markets, as investors scramble to react to recent events. Traders and investors alike are being schooled on the importance of adjusting portfolios to the effects of volatility. If the global financial crisis taught us anything, it\u2019s that it\u2019s best not to own assets when you don\u2019t understand why they\u2019re going down (especially aggressively). Capital preservation is taking place now before our eyes. Traders are alarmed that liquidity is oozing out of the financial sector, Weston adds: Yesterday we heard Saudi Arabia had withdrawn $70b from outside fund holdings, adding to that of nations such as China who have been drawing down on its foreign exchange reserves. The liquidity withdrawal is easily trumping the QE injections from the ECB and BoJ and this is causing a tightening of global financial conditions. Commodity mining and trading firm Glencore will be in the front line again. Yesterday, we watched nervously as Glencore tumbled by 29% after analysts warned that its shares could be wiped out by the commodity crash. Can it do better today? There\u2019s a busy economic agenda ahead, with plenty of data to scrutinise for signs of weakening demand and deflation. 9.30am BST: UK mortgage approvals for August 10am BST: Eurozone consumer confidence for August 1pm BST: German CPI inflation data for September 2pm BST: US Case-Shiller house price survey for July 3pm BST: US Consumer Confidence survey for September And we\u2019ll also be watching Volkswagen, as prosecutors investigate the emissions scandal that has rocked the auto industry.",

Fitch said:</p> <blockquote> <p>The Volkswagen emissions test scandal could prove a turning point for the auto industry worldwide, Fitch Ratings says. It could prompt profound and lasting repercussions far beyond the group\u2019s own credit profile.</p> <p>It is too early to assess the full implications for automotive manufacturers, suppliers and other industry constituents, but we expect the whole sector to be affected to various degrees. Regulators will reassess the timeline to reach planned more stringent emission limit targets and could review the targets themselves. Test protocols will undoubtedly also be toughened and the move towards real driving emission testing cycles will accelerate.<br></p> <p>The scandal could accelerate the underlying growth of vehicles with alternative powertrains, including fuel cells, electric and hybrid engines. It could also lead to a shift back towards petrol engines in Europe, where diesel engines now account for more than half of sales.</p> <p>A shift away from diesel would have a bigger impact on European manufacturers than on their US or Asian rivals. In particular, it may hit manufacturers of small diesel-engine cars harder than premium manufacturers, which have greater price elasticity to absorb higher costs.<br></p> <p>R&amp;D investments are likely to rise as manufacturers face more stringent rules and new test regimes. There is also the potential for business plan reassessment and material investment write-downs if manufacturers have to reassess product pipelines, particularly upcoming engines. Specialist suppliers of emission control technology could initially be hurt by a shift away from diesel, while those with expertise in turbocharging and downsized petrol engines could be at an advantage.<br></p> <p>More broadly, the whole transportation sector could be affected if this emission test crisis fundamentally affects consumers and regulators\u2019 attitude towards cars, driving and pollution. Volkswagen and regulators\u2019 current and future measures in reaction to the crisis will be crucial to mitigating or, conversely, accelerating the impact of this scandal on the group\u2019s own credit profile and broader industry transformations.<br></p> </blockquote> <p>The report is here:</p> <h2><a href=\"https://www.fitchratings.com/site/fitch-home/pressrelease?id=991488\">Fitch: Volkswagen Crisis May Have Lasting Impact Across Sector</a></h2> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2015-09-29T16:20:07.288Z\">at 5.20pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-560ab433e4b00e76364a2309\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2015-09-29T15:58:41.572Z\">4.58pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">VW to refit around 5m vehicles</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Volkswagen has given more details of its plans to refit vehicles affected by the emissions scandal.</p> <p>It says it plans to refit some five million diesel vehicles with EA 189 EU5 engines, including certain Golf, Passat and Tiguan models.

      "bodyText": "The world has turned full circle. In the early 1990s, the slow-burn financial crisis that came to a climax in 2008 had its origins in the developing world. From Mexico in 1994 to Thailand in 1997 the story was the same: hot money from abroad; asset price booms; overvalued currencies; burst bubbles; hot money rushing for the exit. Eventually, the malaise wormed its way from the periphery of the global economy to its core: the developed markets of north America and western Europe. Now the focus of the International Monetary Fund is back on the risks presented by the emerging world. The Fund is not alone in its analysis. Andrew Haldane, the Bank of England\u2019s chief economist, said recently that a fresh meltdown in emerging markets could form part three of a crisis trilogy following the near-death of the banks in 2008 and the threat to the eurozone. But the IMF\u2019s warning is timely. In recent years investors have piled into emerging markets in a pretty indiscriminate fashion looking for higher returns than have been available in the west. They haven\u2019t looked too hard at the strengths and weaknesses of individual countries or companies. As in the 1990s, there has been excessive borrowing, much of it in hard foreign currencies. Debt exposure is particularly high in those sectors - construction and energy - that are vulnerable to the ups and downs of the economic cycle. Finally, despite not being in the best of shape financially, many companies have been able to take advantage of exceptionally low global interest rates to float bonds. The Fund fears that there could be a wave of corporate failures as western countries begin the process of returning policy to a more normal setting. Financial markets think this will begin later this year with an interest rate increase from the US Federal Reserve, a likely catalyst for the crisis in emerging markets the Fund clearly fears. If that proves to be the case, the west will feel the impact: losses in the financial sector and deflation as falling currencies make goods from developing countries cheaper. Attempts to \u201cnormalise\u201d interest rates may prove short lived.",

GlaxoSmithKline, Gala Coral Group, Whitbread, Capita, John Lewis, the Pentland Group, Acromas Holdings and BHP Billiton. Cripes. That must keep him busy. What\u2019s his surname? Witty, Hornby, Harrison, Parker, Street, Long, Goodsell and Mackenzie. Ah. We\u2019re talking about more than one Andrew here, aren\u2019t we? We are. Eight Andrews, in fact. The name is so common among CEOs of Britain\u2019s top 100 companies that just the men bearing it outnumber all the women (Alison, Melissa, Lindsey, Theresa, Anna and Veronique). I thought it was Daves? I\u2019m sure I read that the Daves were in charge? Or was it Johns? That\u2019s of FTSE 100 companies, or the S&amp;P 1500. In the spring it was revealed that 14 FTSE CEOs were named David or Dave and 17 were John or Jean, heavily outnumbering the list\u2019s seven women. Meanwhile in the US, Johns led 5.3% of S&amp;P 1500 companies, Daves 4.5%, and women 4.1%. Right. So where did all these Andrews come from? They\u2019re what you get if you start with a slightly different list, made of the 50 biggest FTSE companies combined with the UK\u2019s 50 biggest privately owned ones. Why would you do that? Because you\u2019re an attention-seeking workwear manufacturer called Stormline and you want something to go to the press about. Oh. Anyway, the point is that women are horribly outnumbered by men at the top of modern businesses \u2013 not just by Daves or Johns or Andrews specifically. The average CEO is also white and nearly 55. Isn\u2019t the real point that top executives and aspiring top executives are likely to be very experienced people and therefore have been born in the 1950s or 1960s, which means their careers, attitudes and names were mostly formed by the prevailing attitudes and gender roles of 40 years ago and therefore that this kind of inequality, though very undesirable, reflects more on the values of the past than on the values of the present, which should hopefully gradually improve the ratio of women to men in the decades to come? That might also be a point, yes. Do say: \u201cAnd still Andy Burnham can\u2019t win!\u201d Don\u2019t say: \u201cAs long as we don\u2019t get a King Andrew, I\u2019m happy.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Sports Direct has snapped up a 19% stake in Findel, the online specialist and the owner of replica football strip retailer Kitbag. Shares in Findel, which also runs gift catalogues and an educational supplies business, soared 13% to 228p on speculation that Mike Ashley, the Sports Direct executive deputy chairman, would buy the group or there could be a bidding war for Kitbag. As the Sports Direct stake was revealed, Findel said it had agreed terms subject to contract with a third party, not Sports Direct, over the sale of Kitbag. James Collins, an analyst at Stifel, said he thought it highly likely that the buyer was from overseas. News of the stake in Findel, which would have cost Sports Direct about \u00a332m, prompted speculation that Ashley was looking to disrupt the Kitbag deal. Findel appointed the auditors KPMG last year to help manage the sale of Kitbag, which could be worth about \u00a320m. Sports Direct was among a number of parties that held talks with Findel about buying the replica strip business at the time. But the process was set aside in May when the Findel chairman, David Sugden, said it would be in the best interests of shareholders to develop Kitbag within the group. Sports Direct did not comment on why it had bought the stake in Findel but Ashley has a history of taking strategic stakes in businesses in an attempt to gain influence over their boards. A source close to the company said: \u201cSports Direct looks forward to working with the management as a supportive shareholder.\u201d Earlier this year, his company took out a put option on shares in Debenhams, which gave it a 16.6% stake as Sports Direct negotiated a deal to manage sports goods areas within the department store chain. He also bought stakes in Blacks Leisure and the now-bust JJB Sports. The firm maintains a 10% stake in JD Sports Fashion. Ashley has previously described such financial plays as part of a wider conversation with the target company. They have rarely led to an outright takeover bid.",

The CBI said in its monthly snapshot of the distributive trades that high street and online sales volumes were well above normal for the time of year, with food and clothes outlets notching up particularly strong performances. The employers\u2019 organisation said 41% of the 119 retailers polled said business was above average for a September, against 6% who said they were below average. The balance of +35 percentage points was the highest since April 2007. Retailers believe consumers will continue to spend freely in October and are planning to increase orders with suppliers at the fastest rate in almost five years. The strong CBI survey followed weak official data for retail sales, which showed a slowdown in high street activity in July and August. Rain Newton-Smith, the CBI\u2019s director of economics, said: \u201cLow inflation and the recovery in wage growth are helping to stimulate consumer demand, but the slowdown in the global economy and tight margins mean retailers won\u2019t get ahead of themselves as we head into autumn. \u201cClothing and the food and drink sectors have led the way, and with the general outlook for the UK economy remaining positive, the expectation is that there will be further encouraging results next month.\u201d The CBI survey found that 60% of retailers questioned said sales volumes in September were up on the same month in 2014, against 11% that reported a decline.

Howard Archer, UK economist at IHS Global Insight, said it was a \u201cvery strong CBI distributive survey for September [and] provides reassurance that consumers are still very alive and kicking\u201d.",

      "bodyText": "Bankers to Hastings, the car insurer, have valued the group\u2019s imminent flotation at between \u00a31.17bn to \u00a31.4bn despite choppy stock market conditions. The group, which was founded by the insurance tycoon, Neil Utley, who is leaving the board as part of the deal, is led by Gary Hoffman, who was parachuted in to run Northern Rock in 2008 after its credit crunch bailout. Hastings is one of several private companies pressing ahead with plans to join the stock market via a public sale of shares despite the volatile markets. Others include Worldpay, the payments processing group led by Sir Michael Rake, Equiniti, the finance and administration services company, and housebuilder Countryside. Hoffman and the management team have attended roadshows with institutions for several days. As part of the deal, Goldman Sachs and the founder shareholders will sell a portion of their shares. The total value of the share offer could be as high as \u00a3390m. If the deal goes ahead, Goldman Sachs, which recently bought 50% of the group, will make a massive return on its investment. The banking firm and the founder shareholders, including Utley, are subject to a lock-out period of 180 days in relation to the shares they own in the group following the formal offer. Goldman Sachs paid about \u00a3150m for its Hastings stake in 2013 and could see that investment worth almost as much as \u00a3700m if the deal goes ahead at the top of the range. Utley, who still has up to 15% of the stock, would see that shareholding valued at up to \u00a3210m at the top of the range. Despite founding the group and being its largest individual shareholder, Utley is not mentioned in the 16-page intention to float document that accompanied the company\u2019s statement last month that it was looking to raise up to \u00a3400m in the stock market. Although the roadshow is going well, some potential investors are sceptical about how quickly the group\u2019s profits have grown over the last couple of years. Hastings is one of two companies coming to market with an all-male main board. The other is Worldpay. Mervyn Davies, the architect of a government initiative to increase the number of women in the boardroom, has described the Hastings and Worldpay situations as disappointing. He said he believed potential investors would take note of the absence of senior women when making their decisions about whether to buy shares in the groups.",

The banking firm and the founder shareholders, including Utley, are subject to a lock-out period of 180 days in relation to the shares they own in the group following the formal offer.</p> <p>Goldman Sachs paid about \u00a3150m for its Hastings stake in 2013 and could see that investment worth almost as much as \u00a3700m if the deal goes ahead at the top of the range.<br></p> <p>Utley, who still has up to 15% of the stock, would see that shareholding valued at up to \u00a3210m at the top of the range.</p> <p>Despite founding the group and being its largest individual shareholder, Utley is not mentioned in the 16-page intention to float document that accompanied the company\u2019s statement last month that it was looking to raise up to \u00a3400m in the stock market.</p> <p>Although the roadshow is going well, some potential investors are sceptical about how quickly the group\u2019s profits have grown over the last couple of years. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/sep/29/companies-with-women-on-the-board-perform-better-report-finds\">Companies with women on the board perform better, report finds</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Hastings is one of two companies coming to market with an all-male main board.

Publicly traded companies with male-only executive directors missed out on \u00a3430bn of investment returns last year, the accountancy firm Grant Thornton found in its report, Women in business: the value of diversity. Only one in 10 of the companies surveyed had female board executives. The UK\u2019s share of the forfeited returns was \u00a349bn or about 3% of GDP. In the US the amount was \u00a3373bn; in India it was \u00a39bn. The report sheds further light on the benefits of women in the boardroom as the government prepares a push to get women into top managerial jobs. Previous studies have found that female directors provide a different perspective on subjects ranging from what customers want to risky corporate ventures. In March, women held 23.5% of board positions at FTSE 100 companies, close to the target set by Lord Mervyn Davies in his 2011 review. Though all FTSE 100 firms have female directors, women only make up 8.6% of executive directorships, up from 5.5% four years ago. The figures show a lag in the number of women running companies rather than overseeing them as non-executives. Francesca Lagerberg, global leader for tax services at Grant Thornton, said: \u201cThere is a large opportunity cost for companies associated with male-only executive boards. Those businesses stuck in the past are not fully unlocking their growth potential. Like a world still addicted to fossil fuels, these companies are suffering now.\u201d She called on shareholders to pressure boards to promote women into top managerial roles so that companies do not miss out on performance benefits. Governments also need to ensure companies perform to their highest potential to support the economy. \u201cIn an era when productivity puzzles persist and economies trade within globalised markets, facilitating female participation at a decision-making level within companies might just give them a competitive advantage.\u201d Davies, the former trade minister, last week criticised Hastings and Worldpay, two companies preparing for large flotations, for having no women on their boards.

      "bodyText": "Deepening concern over the health of the Chinese economy has again struck Asian markets, with shares in the region plummeting to their lowest level for three-and-a-half years, after weak Chinese data prompted sharp losses on Wall Street. The Nikkei 225 ended Tuesday down 714.27 points, or 4.05%, from Monday at 16,930.84 \u2013 its lowest level for about eight months. MSCI\u2019s broader index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan slumped 2.3%, touching its lowest levels since June 2012 and extending early declines after Chinese shares opened lower. China\u2019s blue-chip CSI 300 index and the Shanghai Composite Index were down 2% and 1.9%, respectively. European markets also opened lower, with the FTSE 100 falling by around 80 points, or 1.4% in early trading, although it was later trading at 5,909, down around 49 points, or 0.8%. \u201cInvestors are worried about a sharp slowdown in China ... but the biggest risk is a global recession, not just a China issue,\u201d said Steven Leung, a director at UOB Kay Hian in Hong Kong. \u201cIf you look at Japan ... its economy is in bad shape. And the economic situation is not good in Europe, either.\u201d Asian markets were feeling the fallout from China, where a survey of industrial firms published on Monday showed an 8.8% year-on-year decline in profits in August. \u201cIt\u2019s a statistic that usually doesn\u2019t affect stock markets, but due to the breadth of the fall, the outlook on China\u2019s slowdown and its likely global effects has darkened significantly,\u201d Chihiro Ota, general manager of investment research at SMBC Nikko Securities, told Kyodo News. The yen, considered a safe haven by investors in times of market tumult, strengthened against the dollar, with the US currency trading in the 119-yen range on Tuesday morning. Recent surges by the yen have caused alarm in Tokyo, since a stronger yen hits profits made overseas by Japanese manufacturers, the driving force of the world\u2019s third-biggest economy. On Wednesday, all eyes will be on Japan\u2019s Tankan report \u2013 an important indicator of how much confidence companies have in the prospects for economic recovery. For now, global concern is centered on China, where industrial companies\u2019 profits fell at their fastest rate in four years, official data showed on Monday. \u201cThere is a lot of red in Asian equity markets at the moment,\u201d said Martin King, co-managing director at Tyton Capital Advisors. \u201cDisappointing industrial profits in China continue to bolster concerns about growth and many investors are taking profits from the Nikkei and sitting in cash and alternatives, or repatriating capital to western markets in a perceived flight to quality.\u201d Shipping and steel companies were among the hardest hit on Tuesday, as they are more vulnerable to drops in demand from China, the world\u2019s second-biggest economy. Japan\u2019s Topix iron and steel subindex lost 5.2%, with Kobe Steel slumping 11.1% after it cut its earnings outlook. \u201cThe steel sector has been heavily impacted by China\u2019s slowdown because more than 50% of the demand is there,\u201d said Takashi Enomoto, an analyst at the Bank of America Merrill Lynch. \u201cBut Japanese steel companies will be hurt a little less than others by the shrinking demand because of the domestic demand from automotive players.\u201d The week had already got off to a rocky start, with all major indices on Wall Street closing sharply down on Monday. The S&amp;P 500 index hit a one-month low on bullish US consumer spending data in August as it raised concerns the Federal Reserve could hike rates at a time of slackening global growth. Although the Fed decided not to raise interest rates at its meeting earlier this month - citing concern over China \u2013 speculation is building that the central bank could approve a rate hike as early as next month. In a note to clients on Tuesday, Sean Callow, senior currency strategist at Westpac in Sydney, said: \u201cMarkets have heard such talk before and with equities under pressure, it was hard to take rate hike talk seriously.\u201d",

And the economic situation is not good in Europe, either.\u201d</p> <p>Asian markets were feeling the fallout from <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/china\">China</a>, where a survey of industrial firms published on Monday showed an 8.8% year-on-year decline in profits in August.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a statistic that usually doesn\u2019t affect stock markets, but due to the breadth of the fall, the outlook on China\u2019s slowdown and its likely global effects has darkened significantly,\u201d Chihiro Ota, general manager of investment research at SMBC Nikko Securities, told Kyodo News.</p> <p>The yen, considered a safe haven by investors in times of market tumult, strengthened against the dollar, with the US currency trading in the 119-yen range on Tuesday morning.</p> <p>Recent surges by the yen have caused alarm in Tokyo, since a stronger yen hits profits made overseas by Japanese manufacturers, the driving force of the world\u2019s third-biggest economy.</p> <p>On Wednesday, all eyes will be on Japan\u2019s Tankan report \u2013 an important indicator of how much confidence companies have in the prospects for economic recovery.</p> <p>For now, global concern is centered on China, where industrial companies\u2019 profits fell at their fastest rate in four years, official data showed on Monday.</p> <p>\u201cThere is a lot of red in Asian equity markets at the moment,\u201d said Martin King, co-managing director at Tyton Capital Advisors. \u201cDisappointing industrial profits in China continue to bolster concerns about growth and many investors are taking profits from the Nikkei and sitting in cash and alternatives, or repatriating capital to western markets in a perceived flight to quality.\u201d</p> <p>Shipping and steel companies were among the hardest hit on Tuesday, as they are more vulnerable to drops in demand from China, the world\u2019s second-biggest economy.</p> <p>Japan\u2019s Topix iron and steel subindex lost 5.2%, with Kobe Steel slumping 11.1% after it cut its earnings outlook.</p> <p>\u201cThe steel sector has been heavily impacted by China\u2019s slowdown because more than 50% of the demand is there,\u201d said Takashi Enomoto, an analyst at the Bank of America Merrill Lynch. \u201cBut Japanese steel companies will be hurt a little less than others by the shrinking demand because of the domestic demand from automotive players.\u201d</p> <p>The week had already got off to a rocky start, with all major indices on Wall Street closing sharply down on Monday.</p> <p>The S&amp;P 500 index hit a one-month low on bullish US consumer spending data in August as it raised concerns the Federal Reserve could hike rates at a time of slackening global growth.</p> <p>Although the Fed decided not to raise interest rates at its meeting earlier this month - citing concern over China \u2013 speculation is building that the central bank could approve a rate hike as early as next month.</p> <p>In a note to clients on Tuesday, Sean Callow, senior currency strategist at Westpac in Sydney, said: \u201cMarkets have heard such talk before and with equities under pressure, it was hard to take rate hike talk seriously.\u201d</p> <p><br></p> <p><br></p>",

      "bodyText": "Australia needs to improve lax fuel efficiency standards after the Volkswagen emissions scandal or face the prospect of becoming a dumping ground for high-emissions vehicles, advocates have warned. Pressure is mounting on the federal government to tighten legislation governing vehicle emissions standards. Australia is the only advanced economy not to have limits on the amount of carbon dioxide vehicles can omit, although there are restrictions on the amount of nitrogen oxide and carbon monoxide that can be released. The independent senator Nick Xenophon has called for harsh penalties for manufacturers that deliberately \u201cgame\u201d the system. \u201cIf a company is out by more than 10% in its claims, then you ought to be looking at redress for consumers and the companies to face a major fine,\u201d he told Sky News on Tuesday. The penalty for car manufacturers who deliberately fudged the figures could be as much as $50m, he said. The Greens have legislation in a Senate committee that would raise the emissions standards to European Union levels. The legislation would see two separate targets, of 130g of carbon dioxide per km by 2020 and 95g of CO2 / km by 2023. \u201cAustralia\u2019s fuel efficiency standards lag behind the rest of the world. By accepting such a low bar we\u2019re forcing ourselves to spend more on petrol and generate more pollution than new car drivers in Europe, China, India and Japan,\u201d the Greens leader, Richard Di Natale, said. \u201cI\u2019m calling on the Liberals, Nationals and Labor to support the Greens\u2019 bill to bring Australia\u2019s car fuel efficiency into line with European standards. Both the major parties have identified vehicle emissions as an easy target for cutting pollution and lowering the cost of living, so let\u2019s do it.\u201d Matt Levey, from the consumer group Choice, said Australia had become an easy target for carmakers to offload inefficient vehicles because of its lax emissions standards. \u201cWe\u2019re already a dumping ground, to a certain extent,\u201d he said. He has welcomed calls for Australian vehicle emissions levels to fall into line with comparable countries. \u201cIt absolutely makes sense to look at what local markets have done,\u201d Levey said. \u201cIf it\u2019s good enough for them, it\u2019s good enough for us.\u201d Concerns about the impact that tighter standards would have on local carmakers have been a sticking point for governments in taking action, but with the last Australian-made cars due to roll off production lines in 2017, the political barriers to changing efficiency standards have all but been removed. \u201cIt has been an excuse; it has been a very political debate,\u201d Levey said. \u201cBut the excuse is definitely over.\u201d Xenophon said the sneaky tactics used to meet emissions standards, including using high-powered lubricant and low-tread tires and even removing backseats in order to make the vehicle lighter, have been starkly exposed by the VW scandal. Earlier this month, the United States Environmental Protection Agency discovered that 482,000 of the German manufacturer\u2019s diesel cars on American roads were releasing up to 40 times more toxic fumes than legally allowed. VW has since admitted that 11m cars worldwide could have been fitted with the software designed to cheat emissions standards, although the Australian arm of the company could not confirm whether vehicles sold in Australia were among that number. VW\u2019s market value has dropped by \u20ac25bn since the scandal broke. The company admitted that millions of vehicles made by its subsidiaries, such as Audi, Skoda and Seat, have been a fitted with the cheating technology, and criminal proceedings against VW group\u2019s former boss, Martin Winterkorn, began in Germany on Monday. Levey has warned that the VW scandal \u201cmay well be the tip of the iceberg\u201d, and has called on greater transparency from all car manufacturers exporting to Australia.",
