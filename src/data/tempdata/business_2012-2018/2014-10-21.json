RBS, which is 81%-owned by the taxpaer, was fined \u00a3390m last year for manipulating Libor by regulators in the US and the UK. It was given immunity from one \u20ac110m fine after telling the commission it had tried to influence Swiss franc interest rates with JP Morgan. The Wall Street bank was fined \u20ac61.7m \u2013 getting a 40% discount for co-operating with the investigation into Swiss franc Libor-rigging between March 2008 and July 2009. In a separate action, RBS was also spared a \u20ac5m fine for another offence \u2013 again involving the pricing of a Swiss franc interest rate \u2013 after alerting the commission to the actions of JP Morgan, and Swiss banks UBS and Credit Suisse which were fined a total of \u20ac32m. Issuing the findings against JP Morgan and RBS for rigging Swiss franc Libor, Joaqu\u00edn Almunia, the commission\u2019s vice-president in charge of competition policy, said it was third time Europe\u2019s competition authorities had fined banks and brokers for forming cartels to fix crucial benchmark interest rates such as Libor or Euribor. In December 2013 it hit six firms, including RBS, with combined fines of \u20ac1.7bn for colluding to fix Euribor and yen Libor. The latest run-in with regulators came as the body which controls the taxpayer\u2019s stake in RBS said dealing with the mistakes of the past could delay any attempt to sell off part of the government\u2019s shareholding. Even so, UKFI said it had meetings with its adviser JP Morgan five times in the past month to discuss a potential sell-off and there was more interest from potential buyers of the shares, bought for \u00a345bn in 2008 and 2009. The taxpayer stake is worth about \u00a332bn and James Leigh-Pemberton, UKFI\u2019s chairman, said if the current business model for RBS continued to show results then \u201cwe can accelerate the path on which we get back to the private sector\u201d. He gave no indication when this might occur. Leigh-Pemberton also admitted that the Treasury had ruled out allowing RBS to pay higher bonuses in April to avoid a \u201cmajor public controversy\u201d. UKFI had thought RBS should be allowed to ask shareholders to back plans to pay bonuses twice the size of salaries but the Treasury had ordered payouts remain no higher than salaries, in line with the EU\u2019s cap on bonuses. Andrew Tyrie, the Conservative MP who chairs the Treasury select committee, said UKFI had a \u201cthankless task\u201d and should be wound up and put back inside the Treasury.",

      "bodyText": "Reports that the European Central Bank might start buying corporate bonds as part of its attempts to lift the flagging eurozone economy were enough to boost European stock markets. Better than expected Chinese GDP figures also helped sentiment, while Wall Street also got off to a good start following positive home sales numbers and well received numbers from technology companies Apple and Texas Instruments. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished 105.26 points or 1.68% to 6372.33 Germany\u2019s Dax added 1.94% to 8886.96 France\u2019s Cac climbed 2.25% to 4081.24 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB rose 2.79% to 19,057.72 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended 2.39% better at 10,152.1 In the US, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently 169 points or 1% higher. On that note it\u2019s time to close up for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. Following the earlier fines for Libor fixing, the European Commission has also slapped down another cartel. Four banks - Royal Bank of Scotland and JP Morgan (both again) as well as UBS and Credit Suisse - were found to have operated a cartel on bid-ask spreads of Swiss franc interest rate derivatives. The commission has imposed total fines on the banks of \u20ac32.35m, but again RBS received immunity from fines for revealing the cartel\u2019s existence. UBS will pay \u20ac12.65m, JP Morgan \u20ac10.53m and Credit Suisse \u20ac9.17m. Commission vice-president in charge of competition policy, Joaqu\u00edn Almunia, said: Unlike in previous cartels we found in the financial sector, this one did not involve any collusion on a benchmark. Rather, the four banks agreed on an element of the price of certain financial derivatives. This way, the banks involved could flout the market at their competitors\u2019 expense. Back to the worsening UK public finances, and economists are saying the poor figures mean an early return of the UK\u2019s triple A credit rating is not on the cards. Howard Archer, chief economist at IHS Global Insight, said: It is worth noting that the UK\u2019s weakened public finance performance makes it even more unlikely that either Moody\u2019s or Fitch will restore their AAA credit rating for the UK anytime soon. Both Moody\u2019s &amp; Fitch have kept their credit rating for the UK one notch below AAA and in both cases the outlook on this is stable. This is partly because both rating agencies have appreciable concerns about the UK\u2019s public finances. However, if the UK continues to see weaker-than-expected public finances and growth falters over the coming months, there could be a renewed risk to the UK\u2019s one remaining AAAA rating from Standard &amp; Poor\u2019s. S&amp;P actually revised up the outlook on its AAA rating for the UK back up to stable from negative in June. Adding to the more positive mood in the US, existing home sales hit a one year high in September, indicating a continuing recovery in the housing market. According to the National Association of Realtors, sales rose 2.4% to an annual rate of 5.17m units, compared to forecasts of 5.10m, up from August\u2019s 5.05m. Wall Street has opened, and the US market is joining in the positive party. Technology shares rallied after a positive reaction to results from Apple and Texas Instruments, with the S&amp;P 500 up 0.6% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average 77 points or 0.47% higher in early trading. Royal Bank of Scotland and JP Morgan have been found guilty by the European Commission of operating a cartel to rig the Swiss franc Libor interest rate. The offences took place between March 2008 and July 2009, with the banks trying to distort the normal pricing arrangements. RBS was let off a fine because it revealed the existence of the cartel to the commission, while JP Morgan has to stump up \u20ac61.6m, reduced for co-operating with the investigation. Commission vice-president in charge of competition policy, Joaqu\u00edn Almunia, said: This is the third case where the Commission finds a cartel related to the manipulation of a financial benchmark, in which major banks colluded instead of competing with each other. Our economy needs a healthy, transparent, well-functioning financial sector. This is why antitrust rules in this sector must be strictly enforced. Full commission statement A quick recap. Britain is on track to miss its borrowing targets for this year, having borrowed 10% more during this financial year than in 2013-14. Public finance figures for September, released this morning, show that borrowing jumped last month. Economists blame weak income tax receipts, and predicted that George Osborne would struggle to offer many giveaways in December\u2019s Autumn Statement. The Treasury warned that the weak global economy was hurting the UK.... ...but the opposition Labour party, and the Unite and TUC unions, said the chancellor was to blame. Elsewhere.... European stock markets jumped on a report that the European Central Bank might start buying corporate bonds in a new bid to stimulate the eurozone economy. The FTSE 100 is up 55 points, or 0.9%, and the French CAC has jumped 1.5%. ECB insiders are saying that any corporate bond-buying plan isn\u2019t on its agenda. (but has the agenda even been written yet?!) The French prime minister has led the tributes to Total\u2019s CEO, Christophe de Margerie, who died last night in an aeroplane crash in Moscow PM Manuel Valls said France had lost \u201can extraordinary business leader who turned Total into a world giant.\u201d And China\u2019s economy has grown at its slowest rate in almost six years, expanding at an annual rate of 7.3% in the third quarter of 2014. Economists reckon the figures show that China\u2019s economy is slowing, but aren\u2019t too alarmed. And with that I\u2019m handing over to my colleague Nick Fletcher. Fast food giant McDonald\u2019s problems continue. Earnings at McDonalds fell by 30% in the third quarter of 2014, according to figures just released. It made just $1.09 per share, versus $1.52 a share last year. Global same-store sales slid by 3.3%, worse than the 2.8% analysts had expected. Sales in its core US market are also down by 3.3%, versus forecasts of a 2.5% drop. Chief executive Dan Thompson warned that the troubles will continue, with global comparable sales expected to be negative in October. And McDonald\u2019s investors are not loving it -- shares are down in pre-market trading. We\u2019re collecting all the best reaction to today\u2019s public finances here: #Youarewelcome Government borrowing rises: what the economists say Back in the UK, unions are blasting the government for its failure to lower Britain\u2019s borrowing. The Trades Union Congress argues that the 10% jump in the deficit in September (details start at 9.45am) show that the chancellor has blundered. TUC chief Frances O\u2019Grady says: \u201cIt\u2019s time for George Osborne to admit he got his strategy wrong. Today\u2019s figures show the deficit getting bigger as tax revenues dry up. \u201cThe 90,000 people who marched through the streets of London on Saturday calling for a pay rise understand that it\u2019s not just British workers who need wages to go up, but that\u2019s what the Treasury and the economy needs too. \u201cOnly a wages-led recovery can bring about the boost in demand that businesses need and the boost in revenue that the government needs to cut the deficit and invest for the future.\u201d Wage increases are only running at around 0.7% annually at present, well below the rate of inflation (1.2%). Unite general secretary Len McCluskey argues that Conservative politicians shouldn\u2019t be pledging tax cuts in the next parliament: \u201cGeorge Osborne\u2019s track record is one of failure and broken promises. He\u2019ll have to cut borrowing by a massive 37 per cent over the next six months, if he\u2019s to keep to his target for the year.\u201cDavid Cameron has no right to promise \u2018giveaways\u2019 paid for by the poor, while his chancellor is running the economy so poorly. \u201cIt\u2019s a dismal record and the figures show that his so-called \u2018economic plan\u2019 is doomed and that the recovery is nothing more than an illusion for millions of people struggling to make ends meet. More charts. This one shows the different assets which the European Central Bank could mop up. So far, it\u2019s only aiming for asset-backed securities and covered bonds. And this one shows how the ECB has actually been tightening monetary policy, as banks repay low-cost loans taken out when the eurozone crisis was more intense. Eurozone peripheral bonds are strengthening too, pushing down bond yields. It\u2019s hard to believe that Germany would welcome the ECB widening its bond-buying programme to cover corporate debt, as rumoured this morning (see earlier post). Jens Weidmann, Bundesbank chief, opposed the current plan to buy asset-backed bonds; an extension could raise his ire. Jonathan Ferro of Bloomberg tweets: This chart, from Credit Agricole\u2019s top analyst Frederik Ducrozet, shows why it would be very significant if the ECB started buying up corporate bonds: Europe\u2019s stock markets have jumped, and the euro has fallen, following a report that the European Central Bank is working on a new bond-buying stimulus plan. Reuters is reporting that the ECB is considering buying corporate debt (bonds issued by companies), to help stimulate growth and fight deflation. It could activate the plan as soon as December. That sparked an immediate rally. Most of the main indices are up at least 1%, while the euro has lost around 0.25% against the US dollar to \u20ac1.276. Reuters says: The European Central Bank is considering buying corporate bonds on the secondary market and may decide on the matter as soon as December with a view to begin buying early next year, several sources familiar with the situation told Reuters. The ECB has already carried out work on such purchases, which would widen out the private-sector asset-buying programme it began on Monday - stimulus it is deploying to try to foster lending to businesses and thereby support the euro zone economy.\u201d The pressure in this direction is high,\u201d said one person familiar with the work inside the ECB, speaking on condition of anonymity. Asked about the possibility of making such purchases, an ECB spokesman said: \u201cThe Governing Council has taken no such decision.\u201d Yesterday, the ECB began buying up \u2018covered bonds\u2019 (securities backed by revenue from debts such as mortgages). Targeting corporate bonds would extend the Bank\u2019s firepower. Reaction to follow.... Here\u2019s our story on Britain\u2019s rising deficit: Government borrowing 10% higher than last year The TaxPayers\u2019 Alliance argues that the solution is to cut more aggressively: CEO Jonathan Isaby argues: \u201dAt a time when the deficit should be shrinking rapidly because of healthy economic growth, it\u2019s very alarming to see it growing. Unless the Government gets a proper grip on spending, borrowing will continue to go up and the next generation will have to deal with the consequences. Families across the country make budgets to ensure they don\u2019t spend more than they bring in, and the Government should be no different.\u201d John Maynard Keynes was unavailable for comment..... The Telegraph\u2019s Jeremy Warner also blames low wage growth for Britain\u2019s deficit reduction pains: Economist Rob Wood of Berenberg Bank agrees that weak wage growth is hampering the government\u2019s debt reduction efforts, pushing the deficit higher this year. He writes: It is still early days and the figures could be significantly revised. But the trends seem clear enough. The economic recovery is creating plenty of jobs which should help keep a lid on benefit spending, but still weak wage growth along with the Chancellor\u2019s decision to increase the amount people can earn tax free has hurt income tax receipts and means borrowing stubbornly refuses to decline. And that\u2019s why income tax receipts is up just 0.1%, whereas VAT is up 3.9%, stamp duty has surged 25.2% and corporation tax has grown by 5.4%. Some of that income tax weakness is a distortion related to shifting timing of bonus payments in 2013, but there is more to it than just a distortion. The rising deficit means George Osborne may have little opportunity to woo voters with pre-election goodies. Howard Archer of IHS Global Insight says: Mr. Osborne faces an awkward fiscal backdrop as he announces his autumn statement in December as the May 2015 general election draws every nearer. This gives him little scope to announce any major sweeteners. And further cuts/tax rises will be required after the election, Archer adds: Fiscal policy and the public finances will be a key battleground for the political parties. Any tax promises and spending initiatives by the political parties in the run-up to the general election will need to be closely examined. And here\u2019s the rebuttal from Chris Leslie MP, Labour\u2019s Shadow Chief Secretary to the Treasury. He says today\u2019s public sector finance figures, showing a 10% rise in borrowing this year, undermine the chancellor\u2019s credibility. \u201cThese figures are a serious blow to George Osborne. Not only is he set to break his promise to balance the books by next year, but borrowing in the first half of this year is now 10 per cent higher than the same period last year. As the OBR said last week, stagnating wages and too many people in low-paid jobs are leading to more borrowing. Leslie adds that Labour will \u201cbalance the books and get the national debt falling as soon as possible in the next Parliament\u201d, but in a fairer way than the Conservatives: \u201cWe will reverse the \u00a33 billion tax cut for the top one per cent of earners, stop paying the winter fuel allowance to the richest pensioners, raise child benefit by just one per cent for two years and cut ministers\u2019 pay by five per cent. And we will act to secure a strong and balanced recovery that delivers more good jobs and rising living standards for the many, not just a few at the top.\u201d The Treasury claims that the recovery is on track, despite today\u2019s disappointing borrowing figures showing the deficit is rising. A spokesman says: \u201cThe government\u2019s long term economic plan is working: delivering the fastest growing economy in the G7, putting more people into work than ever before, and reducing the deficit by more than a third. We have seen stronger growth in receipts this month, but as today\u2019s figures show, the impact of the great recession is still being felt in our economy and the public finances. At the same time, we have to recognise that the UK is not immune to the problems being experienced in Europe and other parts of the world economy. That\u2019s why we will continue working through the plan that is building a resilient British economy.\u201d It looks increasingly unlikely that George Osborne will achieve his target of cutting the deficit this year, compared with 2013-14. Today\u2019s figures show that Britain has already borrowed \u00a35.4bn more than a year ago. But... a late surge in tax revenues next year, when self-assessment tax receipts land, could still save him.... Why is Britain borrowing more than a year ago, even though the economy has been growing pretty strongly over the last year? The answer is weak wage growth, which means that income tac receipts are barely higher in April-September 2014 compared with 2013. The ONS reports, that in the first half of this financial year: VAT receipts increased by \u00a32.3 billion, or 3.9%, to \u00a361.5 billion; income tax-related payments increased by \u00a30.1 billion, or 0.1%, to \u00a371.5 billion; stamp duties (on shares, land &amp; property) increased by \u00a31.5 billion, or 25.2%, to \u00a37.3 billion; corporation tax increased by \u00a30.9 billion, or 5.4%, to \u00a318.4 billion; Britain\u2019s public sector finances have worsened, according to the latest figures. The Office for National Statistics reports that the UK borrowed \u00a311.8bn in September, which is 15% or \u00a31.6bn more than a year ago. So despite the recovery, Britain is having to borrow more to balance the books. And that means that public sector net borrowing excluding public sector banks (PSNB ex) from April to September 2014 was \u00a358.bn, an increase of \u00a35.4bn compared with the same period in 2013/14. That takes Britain further away from its goal of borrowing less in the 2014-15 financial year, than in 2013-2014, as this chart shows: The ONS reports that central government receipts rose by \u00a31.4bn, or 3.1% compared with September 2013. But central government expenditure (current and capital) in September 2014 rose by \u00a32.9bn, or 5.4%, meaning more borrowing was needed to cover the gap. Economists aren\u2019t impressed. More reaction to follow.... Back to the Chinese slowdown...and economists are arguing that today\u2019s data could have been worse. Duncan Innes-Kerr, China analyst at the Economist Intelligence Unit, says Perhaps the most important take-away from the GDP numbers is that there were no unpleasant surprises. In a week when the markets have been looking jittery, many will take comfort in the fact that the world\u2019s second largest economy is continuing to churn ahead at such a fast pace. With the economy able to grow by 7.3% in the third quarter, the government is not likely to be launching big stimulus policies in the near future. The relief measures that are provided will remain modest and targeted, and will do little to reverse the overall slowdown. Worryingly, credit is still growing much faster than GDP, so we are looking at a growth story that is built on debt - a very shaky foundation. China will need to begin deleveraging at some point in the future, and when that happens the economy will have to brace for even more pain. However, there is no reason to think that this process needs to begin in the next year or two. Marc Ostwald of ASM Investor Services argues that we should welcome the news that growth slowed to \u2018just\u2019 7.3% in the last quarter. Perhaps the most pertinent observation on the China GDP data is this, the pessimists will point to this being the slowest pace of China GDP growth in five years, and then wax lyrical about China\u2019s structural problems above all in terms of its bad credit/loans problems (which are very real), but the fact remains that China\u2019s economy is now ca. 50% larger than it was five years ago. Thus to expect it to sustain an annual GDP pace of 7.5-8.0% is in fact to show a complete misunderstanding of statistics, and if growth were to accelerate rather than decelerate further as it should given this base effect, is in effect to demand that the Chinese economy to overheat, and by extension to ensure that its bad loans/credit problems get worse. But they won\u2019t sell any shares Market volatility strikes again! BCA Marketplace, the UK used car seller (formerly called British Car Auctions), has just called off its stock market flotation, which would have valued it at \u00a31.2bn. It says: Given the volatility in global equity markets, the Board and Shareholders of BCA Marketplace (\u201cBCA\u201d) have chosen not to proceed with its initial public offering at this time. The Board and Shareholders were very encouraged by the broad engagement and interest in BCA shown by investors and remain excited about supporting the next phase of the Group\u2019s growth. Last week, Virgin Money decided not to float on the stock market his month, and challenger bank Aldermore called off its IPO. Shares in ASOS, the UK web fashion retailer, have jumped 15% this morning after it reported a 27% surge in sales over the last year. Pre-tax profits fell by 14%, to \u00a346.9m, due to the strength of the pound and a fire at its main warehouse last summer. Chief executive Nick Robertson, who has reported three profit warnings in the last year, was upbeat: \u201cDespite all that happened this year, we still delivered 27% growth in sales, with the UK a standout performance at 35% growth.\u201d Consumer goods giant Reckitt Benckiser is leading the FTSE 100 fallers, down 2.1%. Reckitt, whose products include Dettol, Nurofen painkillers and Veet hair-removal creams, said annual sales growth will be at the lower end of expectations. It cited slowing markets in southeast Asia and Latin America, which overshadowed a strong performance in its key European markets. Rakesh Kapoor, CEO, said: Weak markets across South East Asia and Latin America contributed to weak growth in the LAPAC [Latin America and Asia Pacific area] areas. European stock markets have opened in the red, as the slowdown in Chinese growth weighs on investors. The French CAC dipped by 0.6%, with Total dropping 1.5% following the death of CEO Christophe de Margerie at Moscow\u2019s Vnukovo international airport. The German DAX fell 0.75% in early trading. The FTSE 100 is flat, though, lifted by microchip maker ARM Holdings which posted a 9% rise in profits in the last quarter. Over in Asia, Chinese stocks fell after growth slowed to its lowest rate since the early days of the financial crisis: Russian president Vladimir Putin has expressed his condolences over Total CEO\u2019s Christophe de Margerie death in Moscow. Russia Today has the details: TASS cited his spokesman as saying that \u201cVladimir Putin has long known de Margerie and had a close working relationship with him.\u201d \u201cThe president highly appreciated de Mergerie\u2019s business skills, his continued commitment to the development of not only bilateral Russian-French relations but also on multifaceted levels,\u201d Peskov also said. Alexei Kudrin, Russia\u2019s former finance minister and a noted economic liberal, tweets that Christophe de Margerie had done a lot to bring investment to Russia. He describes the Total chief\u2019s death as a heavy tragedy: France\u2019s prime minister has led the tributes to Christophe de Margerie, following the Total CEO\u2019s death at Moscow\u2019s Vnukovo international airport over night. PM Manuel Valls said France had lost \u201can extraordinary business leader who turned Total into a world giant.\u201d. And Pierre Moscovici, France\u2019s former finance minister, hailed de Margerie as \u201ca great captain of industry, a patriot, a man of conviction and friendship\u201d. Here\u2019s our latest story: Total oil CEO Christophe de Margerie killed in Moscow plane crash De Margerie, and three crew members, died when his private jet collided with a snow plough at Moscow\u2019s Vnukovo international airport on Monday night. The Chinese slowdown is likely to weigh on European stock markets this morning. The main indices are being called down a few points: Economists are warning that China\u2019s economy remains a concern after economic growth slowed to a five-year low in the last quarter. GDP rose by 7.3% , year-on-year, in the July-September quarter, according to data released overnight. That\u2019s slightly better than the 7.2% which was forecast, but otherwise there is little to cheer. Beijing\u2019s official target is to achieve growth of 7.5%. But the slump in its housing market, weaker domestic demand and slowing industrial production are all holding it back. Other data this morning also showed that retail sales slowed for the fourth month running, up 11.6% year-on-year in September. Factory output beat expectations, but fixed asset investment was weaker than forecast. As Nomura analyst point out, recent stimulus measures have only stabilised the ship: \u201cPowerful headwinds from the property market correction and severe overcapacity in many upstream industries, coupled with the reduced potency of policy easing amid an overleveraged economy, means the policy response seems to have only succeeded in stabilising growth rather than driving a strong rebound.\u201d ING economist Tim Condon predicts that the Chinese government won\u2019t be jolted into new measures: \u201cAs long as growth holds up, though, they\u2019re not going to panic.\u201d And if China is weak, the ramifications for the world economy are serious: Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the financial markets, the world economy business, and the eurozone. Four items on the agenda today. 1) Overnight, Chinese GDP data has shown that its economy grew at the slowest pace since 2009, at an annual rate of just 7.3%. 2) Development and reaction to the sad news that the chief executive of Total was has died in an aeroplane crash in Moscow. 3) We get the new UK public finance figures at 9.30am, showing how much Britain borrowed in September. 4) And we\u2019ll keeping a stern eye on the Bank of England, after yesterday\u2019s payment system crash hit house buyers and delayed billions of pounds of transactions between banks for most of the day. Plus any other developments through the day.",

      "bodyText": "Tyne and Wear has voted to press ahead with reforms that will mean a bus service outside London being taken back under public control for the first time since privatisation. After a long consultation and more than a year of debate with bus operators, which are fiercely opposed to the moves, the regional authority will counter the deregulation brought in by the Thatcher government in the 1980s, and franchise services while setting routes, timetables and fares. The decision is the result of the region aiming to plug a funding gap which has been exacerbated by a huge bill for concessionary bus travel \u2013 a national legal requirement. The local subsidy for buses in Newcastle has reached \u00a355.2m this year while the operators \u2013 mainly Stagecoach, Arriva and Go-Ahead \u2013 have been making large profits. The local authority hopes the new provisions, called quality contract schemes, can help balance the books, while also keeping fares down. The local passenger transport executive, Nexus,, pays operators to run certain routes but it is not permitted to compete on the big, profitable routes. Nexus argues subsidised services are becoming unaffordable. It believes the move, as well as ultimately saving money, will result in better services, which Nexus claims could provide a \u00a3272m economic boost to Tyne and Wear. According to Nexus, 80% of the bus companies\u2019 profits leave the region as payments to shareholders, rather than being reinvested in the local network. Stagecoach, which operates about 40% of buses around Tyne and Wear, made profits in 2014 at a margin of 14.6% on its \u00a31bn bus revenues outside London. On the regulated services in the capital it generated a lower 9.8% margin. The decision will be contested by the big transport firms. Stagecoach has threatened legal action and its chairman, Brian Souter, said he would \u201cdrink poison\u201d rather than accept a quality contract. The bus operators claim the move will lead to higher fares, worse services, and higher tax bills. Kevin Carr, chair of the North East Bus Operators\u2019 Association, said: \u201cNexus has convinced the leaders to take a huge gamble, needing an \u00a380m contingency fund on top of \u00a351m in guaranteed funding every year. It\u2019s not the best way of securing vital bus services for communities in Tyne and Wear.\u201d The bus contracts proposal needs the approval of an independent board chaired by a traffic commissioner, which will rule if the plans pass five key public interest tests. Bus operators said they will be petitioning the board to argue that the plans fail on legal and economic grounds. Bus operators say the quality contract scheme will not deliver a single extra bus and represents a big financial gamble for the public purse. They claim that counter-proposals for a voluntary agreement would see another 50 vehicles on the road as well as smartcards and multi-operator ticketing. But councillor Nick Forbes, leader of Newcastle city Phil Medlicott, managing director of Stagecoach North East, said the moves were putting politics before passengers: \u201cTheir plans are about cutting costs and attempting to fill a financial black hole they are partly responsible for creating. Tyne and Wear has one of the best used bus networks in Britain and amongst the highest passenger satisfaction anywhere in the country.\u201d Labour legislated back in 2000 to allow cities to restore bus operations to public control, but with enough hoops to deter most authorities from going ahead - until recent broader cuts to local budgets made Tyne and Wear consider how to manage its transport bills and reverse declining bus usage. Fares have risen each year since 1995 by an average of 3% above RPI inflation, while the statutory obligation to fund senior citizens\u2019 bus passes costs the region \u00a336m a year.",

      "body": "<p>Apple\u2019s positive results overnight should have given a lift to a key supplier like <strong>Arm</strong>.</p> <p>And so they did initially. But Arm\u2019s own update showed third quarter revenues falling short of expectations, up 12% to $320.2m compared to forecasts of around $326m. Even with upbeat comments about future smartphone demand and improving royalty revenues, the chip maker\u2019s shares fell 45.5p or more than 5% to 806p.</p> <p>Analyst reaction was, as is often the case, mixed. Credit Suisse issued an outperform rating but Societe Generale kept its sell rating:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Guidance for fourth quarter is underwhelming with dollar sales flagged at \u2018about \u20ac350m\u2019, i.e., only in line with current consensus. Arm still sees strong licensing support but year on year growth appears to be slowing as we expected. We were looking for \u20ac340m in fourth quarter sales; today\u2019s guidance implies fourth quarter 15% year on year growth so some improvement versus 12% in the third quarter but Arm had been expecting a strong improvement in the second half of 2-14. This is probably enough (as not a clear miss) to support the shares near term but our medium term view of slowing growth and an adverse mix effect remain.</p> </blockquote> <p>Liberum analysts also marked the shares a sell, saying:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Arm\u2019s third quarter sales were 1% below our forecast and earnings per share was 1% above at 5.92p. In its outlook statement Arm says that it has entered the fourth quarter with a pipeline that points to strong licence revenues and a sequential increase in order backlog. It therefore expects to meet market expectations for the quarter.</p> <p>While licensing continues to be strong for the company, we expect royalty growth to disappoint as smartphone and tablet growth continues to slowdown.</p> </blockquote> <p>But Liberum was more positive on two other Apple suppliers, <strong>Imagination Technologies</strong> and<strong> Laird</strong>. It said:<br></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>[Apple\u2019s] beat in the quarter was driven by iPhone shipments (39.3m versus 38m estimate) with weakness in iPad shipments (12.3m versus 13m estimate). Apple is Imagination\u2019s largest customer accounting for around 30% of revenue. Also helpful for Laird (20% of revenue from Apple) which has greater exposure to the iPhone than iPad.</p> </blockquote> <p>Imagination added 5.75p to 203.5p while Laird was lifted 3.8p to 294.7p.</p> <p>Overall, markets regained some of their poise, partly on talk that the European Central Bank may buy corporate bonds as part of its attempts to help stimulate economic growth and fight deflation.

      "bodyText": "Apple\u2019s positive results overnight should have given a lift to a key supplier like Arm. And so they did initially. But Arm\u2019s own update showed third quarter revenues falling short of expectations, up 12% to $320.2m compared to forecasts of around $326m. Even with upbeat comments about future smartphone demand and improving royalty revenues, the chip maker\u2019s shares fell 45.5p or more than 5% to 806p. Analyst reaction was, as is often the case, mixed. Credit Suisse issued an outperform rating but Societe Generale kept its sell rating: Guidance for fourth quarter is underwhelming with dollar sales flagged at \u2018about \u20ac350m\u2019, i.e., only in line with current consensus. Arm still sees strong licensing support but year on year growth appears to be slowing as we expected. We were looking for \u20ac340m in fourth quarter sales; today\u2019s guidance implies fourth quarter 15% year on year growth so some improvement versus 12% in the third quarter but Arm had been expecting a strong improvement in the second half of 2-14. This is probably enough (as not a clear miss) to support the shares near term but our medium term view of slowing growth and an adverse mix effect remain. Liberum analysts also marked the shares a sell, saying: Arm\u2019s third quarter sales were 1% below our forecast and earnings per share was 1% above at 5.92p. In its outlook statement Arm says that it has entered the fourth quarter with a pipeline that points to strong licence revenues and a sequential increase in order backlog. It therefore expects to meet market expectations for the quarter. While licensing continues to be strong for the company, we expect royalty growth to disappoint as smartphone and tablet growth continues to slowdown. But Liberum was more positive on two other Apple suppliers, Imagination Technologies and Laird. It said: [Apple\u2019s] beat in the quarter was driven by iPhone shipments (39.3m versus 38m estimate) with weakness in iPad shipments (12.3m versus 13m estimate). Apple is Imagination\u2019s largest customer accounting for around 30% of revenue. Also helpful for Laird (20% of revenue from Apple) which has greater exposure to the iPhone than iPad. Imagination added 5.75p to 203.5p while Laird was lifted 3.8p to 294.7p. Overall, markets regained some of their poise, partly on talk that the European Central Bank may buy corporate bonds as part of its attempts to help stimulate economic growth and fight deflation. Meanwhile Chinese GDP showed the country\u2019s econony expanded by 7.3% between July and September, lower than the previous quarter\u2019s 7.5% but slightly higher than forecast. In the US came better than expected existing home sales for September. However Britain\u2019s public sector finances continue to worsen, with the country borrowing \u00a311.8bn in September, 15% more than a year ago. With European markets higher and Wall Street opening on a positive note, the FTSE 100 finished 105.26 points or 1.68% higher at 6372.33. Chris Beauchamp, market analyst at IG, said: Leaving aside the small point of whether the ECB is actually considering a new bond purchase programme, the reports of a possible plan were enough to give markets the additional momentum they needed, building on the broadly upbeat atmosphere created by Apple\u2019s excellent earnings last night.

      "bodyText": "Walking through the assembly plant at Dacia\u2019s sprawling factory complex in Mioveni, 80 miles north-west of Bucharest, Cristian Negoita talks proudly of the factory\u2019s output. \u201cWe make about 65 cars an hour, 1,389 a day,\u201d says the 25-year company veteran and deputy chief of the assembly plant. \u201cBefore we joined Renault we were making 110,000 cars a year here with 30,000 workers, today it\u2019s 340,000 cars, with 14,000 workers.\u201d Nearby, new cars roll off the assembly line, destined for showrooms across Europe. In recent years, as other car manufacturers have lost billions of euros in sales in the aftermath of the global recession, Romania\u2019s Dacia has seen sales soar. The former communist state-owned company, bought by Renault in 1999, is Europe\u2019s fastest-growing car brand, with sales on the continent rising 35% in the first six months of this year, according to the European Automobile Manufacturers Association, fuelled by a high demand for cheap but reliable cars. Last year, in its first 12 months in the UK market, Dacia sold 17,146 cars, a record for a UK car brand launch, with its entry-level Dacia Sandero \u2013 the butt of so many Top Gear jokes \u2013 selling for \u00a35,995. Dacia\u2019s success in recent years has raised its already considerable profile in Romania: its \u20ac4.48bn (\u00a33.5bn) turnover in 2013 represented about 2.9% of the country\u2019s GDP, with the company responsible for an estimated 130,000 jobs in Romania across its supply chain and 8% of the country\u2019s total exports. All of which is impressive for a car brand that few in Europe had heard of until recently and that was failing badly just a decade and a half ago. \u201cDacia has found a space in the market, it was the first to see and exploit this low-cost sector,\u201d says Tim Urquhart, principal analyst at IHS Automotive, who predicts that Dacia will sell 461,000 vehicles this year, and 604,000 by 2021. Dacia was founded in 1966, in the first years of the Ceau\u0219escu regime. It was meant to be a powerful symbol of the country\u2019s industrial strength, named after the Dacians, the early inhabitants of the region. During the 1960s-90s, the company primarily launched licensed versions of cars such as the Renault 12, renamed the Dacia 1300. Though they were notoriously unreliable, Dacias were often the only cars on the Romanian market, so locals eventually became adept at roadside fixes. After the 1989 revolution, Dacia struggled against the tide of foreign cars entering Romania, with the brand failing to improve on outdated designs, equipment and working conditions. \u201cWe didn\u2019t have heating or hot meals. I worked without heat in the winter for nine years between 1990 and 1999,\u201d says Ionela Ghenescu, 43, taking a break from her morning shift in the stamping department. Like many in Mioveni, population 32,000, the company is a family affair for Ghenescu: her husband and son also work at the factory. \u201cMost people in Mioveni work for Dacia,\u201d she says. Sitting in his office on the outskirts of Bucharest, Nicolas Maure, the French chief executive of Dacia Romania, explains Renault\u2019s decision to buy the company. \u201cDacia had an ageing lineup and couldn\u2019t export any more. Volumes were falling and they were looking for a way to recover.\u201d At the time, Renault was considering setting up a factory in the region, to tap into the growing markets. After failing to buy Skoda in a joint bid with Volvo, Renault bought Dacia and invested \u20ac2.2bn in updating its facilities and product line. \u201cOriginally the idea was to use the platform to deliver to the Romanian domestic market and central and eastern Europe.\u201d Renault\u2019s ambitious goal was to create an entry-level car for developing markets that would retail for about \u20ac5,000, and the company focused its energy on keeping costs to a minimum, while maintaining the reliability of the final product. In 2004 it launched the Dacia Logan, which retailed for about \u20ac6,400. \u201cThe initial concept was perhaps a bit dull and boring, but it did the job,\u201d says Philippe Houchois, an analyst at UBS. Between September and December 2004 Dacia sold 40,000 Logans, with Romania representing 60% of sales. However, in 2005 the company started exporting to western Europe and has seen sales grow more than 10% a year since, with Romania now representing only 5% of Dacia sales, though this is also due to a weak domestic market. In the first eight months of 2014 sales of Dacia cars grew in France by 18.9%, Italy 46.4%, Germany 7.7% and Britain 69.7%, the company says, with new markets opening in Malta, Cyprus and across Scandinavia last year. Since 2004 Dacia has introduced seven new vehicles, including the Sandero, Sandero Stepway and Duster. \u201cThe Dacia Duster is the number one selling car for Renault worldwide,\u201d says Maure. \u201cAnd Mioveni is the biggest vehicle plant for Renault in terms of output.\u201d However, there are clouds on the horizon. \u201cThere is a risk of new entrants in the low-cost market,\u201d says Houchois. \u201cDacia is quite critical to Renault \u2013 45%-50% of Renault is driven by their entry-level programme, and Renault can\u2019t believe how long it\u2019s been without competition.\u201d Wages are rising in the company\u2019s Romanian facilities. This month a new round of pay negotiations is due to begin between Dacia management and the workers\u2019 union. In the past, relationships have been fractious: in March 2008, workers demanded a 50% rise, finally agreeing to 28% after a 20-day walkout. \u201cIn seven years, we have increased the wages threefold for blue-collar workers,\u201d says Maure. \u201cWe are paying them twice as much as the average of the country; there must be a kind of slowdown on this.\u201d In recent months management has suggested that if wages cannot be kept down in Romania Dacia will be forced to move more of its operations to Morocco, where it set up a factory in 2012 to handle increasing demand. \u201cIt is key for the Mioveni plant to remain competitive. One way is to keep the employment level, but to do so we have to moderate the wage increase. The other way is a combination of reducing output and greater automation. Option two would lead to thousands of job losses,\u201d says Maure, who expects it to be a difficult negotiation process. In the meantime, Dacia\u2019s Romanian workers are enjoying the rebirth of their national brand. \u201cRomanians have always been proud of Dacia,\u201d says Ion Manu, 45, a maintenance worker at the Mioveni plant. He joined the company in 1987, back when Romania was still behind the Iron Curtain and Dacia cars were rarely found outside the roads of Romania. \u201cWe are really proud now it is successful overseas,\u201d he says.",

      "bodyText": "Looking at the economy, you could say George Osborne peaked early, at least in terms of the electoral cycle. Growth started at the beginning of 2013. It started to wane this summer, almost a year before the general election. Such is the chancellor\u2019s sensitivity to polling numbers that he has already identified a few scapegoats. The favourite is to blame the continentals for allowing stagnation to grip the eurozone. Turning to the public finances, Osborne also peaked early. Coming out of the recession, the deficit tumbled. But this year is characterised by monthly borrowing figures above target, not below. As Samuel Tombs at Capital Economics said in light of the \u00a311.8bn deficit in September versus the forecast \u00a310.3bn, Osborne will be forced to acknowledge in December\u2019s autumn statement that the fiscal consolidation is not going to plan, limiting his scope to announce pre-election sweeteners. A bigger economy was supposed to mean more profitable companies paying more tax. And more employment was supposed to push up income tax receipts. As the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) chairman, Robert Chote, warned last week, neither has happened. The big corporate taxpayers from the pre-recession golden years are still offsetting debts against their tax, or have maintained debt funding to keep themselves going \u2013 which could be deemed sensible in a period of ultra-low interest rates. Banks, property developers, and building companies are doing well at the moment, but the OBR has pointed out they are still some way from paying normal rates of corporation tax. And then there is Osborne\u2019s cut in corporation tax to 21%. A cut that was supposed to show us all that the Laffer curve works \u2013 offsetting the lower rate by encouraging businesses to expand, generate higher profits and more tax \u2013 but appears to have depressed the amount of money capital contributes to the exchequer. With record employment, surely it was reasonable to expect strongly rising income tax to fill government coffers. Not so much now, the Treasury figured, as in January when self-employment receipts boost the yearly takings. This has proved a mirage. Chote felt confident quoting figures that show 35% of the 700,000 newly minted self-employed since 2008 earn less than the \u00a310,000 personal limit and pay no tax. The rest can offset their expenses against tax to depress their tax liability. Self-employed people were billed as the cavalry, but turned out to be a mixed bunch of part-time call centre staff, agency workers and graduates optimistically breathing life into web-based start-ups. It\u2019s not clear why the Treasury had pencilled in bumper receipts for January. In truth, it had no idea what self-employed people were earning or how. It has not published any research. Neither has the Bank of England, which must decide on the level of interest rates without any solid information on this huge constituency. The self-employed account for 15% of the workforce, up from 13% in 2008. It looks like their numbers are only going to grow. Some may be the entrepreneurs of tomorrow, and that will be a boon for the country, but it surely must be worth knowing how much they will contribute in the next few years in pounds and pence. How can policymakers justify their projections when they have no idea whether the latest generation of self-employed people will have any spending power or pay any tax?",

      "bodyText": "Sainsbury\u2019s has suffered its worst sales performance since the 1990s over the past three months, as Tesco shows signs of recovery in a supermarket price war which has tipped the grocery industry into deflation for the first time in more than a decade. Sainsbury\u2019s, which recently cut prices on branded goods, saw its sales slide by 3.1%, a considerable step back from the 1.8% recorded in September, according to analysts at Kantar Worldpanel, an international market research company. Fraser McKevitt, Kantar\u2019s head of retail and consumer insight, said the performance was the worst recorded by Sainsbury\u2019s since it began monitoring supermarket sales in the 1990s. He said the results were in the context of a tough market and set against a strong trading period for the supermarket group last year. Like-for-like grocery prices for the industry fell 0.2% in the 12 weeks to 12 October, the first period of deflation since Kantar began recording price changes in 2006, as all the major grocers attempt to challenge the rise of the discount chains Aldi and Lidl. The German-owned chains achieved double-digit sales growth over the period, with Aldi\u2019s sales up 27.3% and Lidl\u2019s 18.1% higher. Tesco\u2019s market share is 28.8%, down more than 1% on a year ago. Sainsbury\u2019s and Morrisons have also lost market share, to 16.1% and 11% respectively, widening the gap with Asda, the only one of the big four to gain market share year on year. Asda controls 17.3% of the market. Waitrose had a strong start to the autumn, with sales up 6.8% to increase its market share to 5.2%, comfortably ahead of nearest rival, Aldi, which has increased its market share by 1 percentage point year on year to 4.8%. Of the big four, only Asda achieved sales growth over the period, with sales up 1%. McKevitt said shoppers were lured by the supermarket chain\u2019s consistent message on price. \u201cThe message is not complicated and it hasn\u2019t changed and shoppers have rewarded that,\u201d he said. The poor performance for Sainsbury\u2019s is likely to ramp up pressure on its new chief executive, Mike Coupe. It is the latest sign of deterioration at the chain, which recorded its third quarter of declining sales this month after three years of growth. Coupe, who took the reins from longstanding boss Justin King in July, has been criticised for reducing loyalty card rewards, poorly presenting price cuts on branded items, and excluding Tesco from the Sainsbury\u2019s brand match promotion to focus on Asda. In his first presentation to the City this month, Coupe said he was undertaking a review of the business as supermarkets faced the most challenging times he had seen in his 30-year career. Tesco has continued to lose sales and market share, according to Kantar. But there are signs of hope for the new chief executive, Dave Lewis, as the UK\u2019s biggest supermarket has seen an increase in trading, with sales down by 3.6%, an improvement on the 4.5% drop recorded in September. Morrisons dipped, with sales down 1.8%, compared with a 1.3% drop a month before.",

      "body": "<p>Sainsbury\u2019s has suffered its worst sales performance since the 1990s over the past three months, as Tesco shows signs of recovery in a supermarket price war which has tipped the grocery industry into deflation for the first time in more than a decade.</p> <p>Sainsbury\u2019s, which recently cut prices on branded goods, saw its sales slide by 3.1%, a considerable step back from the 1.8% recorded in September, according to analysts at Kantar Worldpanel, an international market research company.</p> <p>Fraser McKevitt, Kantar\u2019s head of retail and consumer insight, said the performance was the worst recorded by Sainsbury\u2019s since it began monitoring supermarket sales in the 1990s. He said the results were in the context of a tough market and set against a strong trading period for the supermarket group last year.</p> <p>Like-for-like grocery prices for the industry fell 0.2% in the 12 weeks to 12 October, the first period of deflation since Kantar began recording price changes in 2006, as all the major grocers attempt to challenge the rise of the discount chains Aldi and Lidl.</p> <p>The German-owned chains achieved double-digit sales growth over the period, with Aldi\u2019s sales up 27.3% and Lidl\u2019s 18.1% higher. Tesco\u2019s market share is 28.8%, down more than 1% on a year ago.</p> <p>Sainsbury\u2019s and Morrisons have also lost market share, to 16.1% and 11% respectively, widening the gap with Asda, the only one of the big four to gain market share year on year. Asda controls 17.3% of the market.</p> <p>Waitrose had a strong start to the autumn, with sales up 6.8% to increase its market share to 5.2%, comfortably ahead of nearest rival, Aldi, which has increased its market share by 1 percentage point year on year to 4.8%.</p> <p>Of the big four, only Asda achieved sales growth over the period, with sales up 1%. McKevitt said shoppers were lured by the supermarket chain\u2019s consistent message on price. \u201cThe message is not complicated and it hasn\u2019t changed and shoppers have rewarded that,\u201d he said.</p> <p>The poor performance for Sainsbury\u2019s is likely to ramp up pressure on its new chief executive, Mike Coupe. It is the latest sign of deterioration at the chain, which recorded its third quarter of declining sales this month after three years of growth.</p> <p>Coupe, who took the reins from longstanding boss Justin King in July, has been criticised for <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/oct/14/sainsburys-halves-nectar-reward-points-loyalty-scheme\" title=\"\">reducing loyalty card rewards</a>, poorly presenting price cuts on branded items, and excluding Tesco from the Sainsbury\u2019s brand match promotion to focus on Asda.</p> <p>In his first presentation to the City this month, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/oct/01/sainsburys-cuts-sales-forecast-supermarket-price-war\" title=\"\">Coupe said he was undertaking a review of the business as supermarkets faced the most challenging times he had seen in his 30-year career</a>.</p> <p>Tesco has continued to lose sales and market share, according to Kantar. But there are signs of hope for the new chief executive, Dave Lewis, as the UK\u2019s biggest supermarket has seen an increase in trading, with sales down by 3.6%, an improvement on the 4.5% drop recorded in September.</p> <p>Morrisons dipped, with sales down 1.8%, compared with a 1.3% drop a month before.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The summer\u2019s World Cup proved a winner for William Hill, and is set to boost its full year figures. The bookmaker said revenues for the 13 weeks to the end of September rose 23% with profits up 89%, helped by punters placing 80% more bets than in the previous tournament four years ago. So it now expects 2014 operating profits to come in at the top end of expectations, assuming the fourth quarter goes as planned. Chief executive James Henderson, who only joined in August, said: The group performed strongly in the third quarter, driven by both favourable sporting results and the continued development of our UK and international businesses. Positive sporting results in the quarter, including a strong end to the World Cup, have moved us close to or ahead of normalised gross win margins on a year-to-date basis. Earlier in the year bookies had been hurt by unfavourable - to them - results in the Premier League. Nick Batram at Peel Hunt said: The third quarter was a complete turnaround from the poor sports results that impacted the corresponding period in 2013 and was further boosted by the World Cup contribution. However, there was also good underlying progress across all businesses. Unfortunately, 2015 sees further cost pressures (particularly taxation) and increased political risk represented by the general election. Therefore, we can\u2019t be more positive than a hold. Numis issued an add recommendation: This is a soundly financed market leader with a growing and under-appreciated international footprint. Today\u2019s trading statement should provide reassurance on management\u2019s ability to deliver on the stated strategy: hence our add recommendation. But the broker also said: Responsible Gambling Trust/NatCen research into gaming machine play is expected soon and may result in further changes to government policy. Legislation to control play above \u00a350 per spin is expected this autumn with implementation in the first half of 2015. The UK duty at the point of consumption (POC) on online gambling is due on 1 December and Machine Games Duty (MGD) will increase from 1 March 2015. [There will be] \u00a3100m of additional duty costs in 2015. PoC and MGD will cost around \u00a3100m next year (pre-mitigation) and our forecasts are for a decline in profit; always a difficult context for a share price to materially outperform in our view.

      "bodyText": "Australia\u2019s third-largest poppy producer, TPI Industries, has announced it is shifting its manufacturing base from Tasmania to Victoria, the latest blow to Tasmania\u2019s four-decade dominance of the country\u2019s $120m opium poppy industry. The closure of TPI\u2019s processing plant at Cressy, south-west of Launceston, will cost the small town about 55 jobs. The island state currently grows almost 50% of the world\u2019s pharmaceutical opium poppy supply, but the first commercial growing licences in Victoria were granted to TPI in August, and the company\u2019s first crop has already been planted at sites in the state\u2019s north. Tasmania\u2019s 43-year Australian monopoly on the narcotic crop was broken in September when the federal health minister, Peter Dutton, signalled a revision to a 1971 treaty restricting poppy growing to the state for security reasons. The change came after sustained lobbying from the pharmaceutical industry, struggling to meet a worldwide demand for painkillers that tripled between 1993 and 2012, according to the UN. TPI\u2019s chief executive, Jarrod Ritchie, said the move to Victoria \u201cwasn\u2019t a decision we made lightly, but the reality was that Victorian policy allowed us to have alternative sources of supply\u201d. Unlike Tasmania\u2019s, Victoria\u2019s poppy-growing regime allows companies to import poppy straw \u2013 which contains sap rich in morphine, thebaine and codeine \u2013 from overseas and have it processed in the state. TPI aims to expand its growing to Portugal, a supply it would have been prohibited from processing in its factories on the Apple Isle. \u201cIt put us in an untenable position, that one of our local competitors, GlaxoSmithKline, had many sources of supply,\u201d Ritchie said. TPI will continue growing in Tasmania and Ritchie said the state \u201cwill continue to be part of our future\u201d. He said he negotiated with the Tasmanian government to lift the ban on importing overseas straw, but \u201cgovernments and business don\u2019t always see eye to eye\u201d. Tasmanian Alkaloids is the last grower with manufacturing facilities in the state. Managing director Doug Blackaby said the company had just invested $21m in its processing plant and had no plans to shift to the mainland, nor grow overseas. Only a handful of countries, including Australia, Spain, Portugal and India, are permitted by the UN to grow poppies, which produce the primary ingredients of a host of pain-relieving medicines \u2013 as well as heroin. A 500-hectare (1,200-acre) commercial trial of the crop is currently under way in the Northern Territory. Keith Rice, the chief executive of the Tasmanian poppy growers\u2019 association, said he backed the state government\u2019s continuing ban on importing foreign poppy straw. \u201cFor four decades we\u2019ve been the world\u2019s leader grower of pharmaceutical pain-management material, and next year if we\u2019re having to import from overseas, that casts serious doubt over our reputation as a reliable supplier and the most secure supplier,\u201d he said.
