Frederic Cilins, 51, had pleaded guilty earlier this year after the FBI covertly recorded his conversations with the widow of the former dictator of Guinea in west Africa. He was also fined $75,000 by a New York federal court. Cilins, a French national, was arrested in Florida last year been arrested last year as part of a US investigation into alleged illegal payments made to Guinean officials to secure mining rights for Steinmetz's BSG Resources (BSGR). Prosecutors have said Cilins had a \"very close personal relationship\" with Steinmetz, Israel's wealthiest person, who controls BSGR. According to the recordings, Cilins said that he was working on behalf of Steinmetz when he attempted to arrange destroy evidence of the alleged bribes. Inquiries into the bribery allegations are continuing in the US and Switzerland, while the current government of Guinea has stripped Steinmetz of his multi-billion dollar iron ore concessions.

      "bodyText": "It's a miracle! Royal Bank of Scotland lives again as a semi-functional bank capable of delivering pleasant profit surprises to its owners (that's mostly us). Profits are up, impairments are down massively and just look at that share price \u2013 up 11% in a day. Actually, it's not a miracle. Chief executive Ross McEwan was claiming only \"steady progress\" yesterday and that sober assessment is fair. RBS is a bank of many moving parts. What happened in the first half of this year is that economic revival in the UK and Ireland greased the wheels of some of the most visible parts of the machine. A 20% jump in house prices in Dublin in a year, for example, has a big impact if you have an oversized local loan book stuffed with troublesome residential and commercial mortgages. Very welcome, too, is the fact that fewer UK businesses are struggling to service their loans. But let's not forget the clunking parts of the machine. The non-core assets in the internal \"bad\" bank have fallen rapidly to \u00a321bn and \u00a315bn-\u00a318bn is in prospect for the end of year. That still leaves plenty of room for misses if, say, a new crisis were to flare in the eurozone. Meanwhile, remember the \"legacy conduct issues\", as the euphemism has it. If regulators prove mischief and collusion by banks in the foreign exchange market, the level of fines is anybody's guess. McEwan and RBS still seem to be focused on 2017 as a date when the bank could be declared to be properly cleaned up. At that point, RBS might be capable of making clean profits of about \u00a34bn, assuming targets for cost-to-income ratios are met. If 12 times earnings is a suitable yardstick, that would imply a 450p-500p share price in three years, versus 365p today. That's if all goes well. Given the uncertainties, if the Treasury gets the chance to trim the state's holding at 400p-plus in 2015, it should probably grab it. BSkyB Roll up, roll up, for another big bet from BSkyB \u2013 the third if one ignores Rupert Murdoch's initial gamble 25 years ago on persuading Brits to pay to watch telly. The first was in 1999, when dividends to shareholders were abruptly cancelled to fund investment in new-fangled digital technology. Then in 2004, when dividends had only just been restarted, new boy chief executive James Murdoch gave non-family shareholders a heart attack by saying profit margins would shrink to fund a march towards 10m subscribers; he knocked 20% off the share price in a day. Both bets paid off handsomely, which perhaps explains shareholders' relative calm about the latest adventure \u2013 the birth of Sky Europe via the purchase of sister companies in Germany and Italy for up to \u00a37.4bn. But this is not merely a shuffle of assets within the Murdoch empire. To do these deals BSkyB is stretching its financial ratios just like the old days. Even after raising \u00a31.36bn from shareholders, it could end up with borrowings representing four times current top-line profits if all minority shareholders in Sky Deutschland tender their shares. That's punchy. BSkyB's credit ratings will inevitably be downgraded. In terms of actual price, the twin purchases pass the smell test. The \u00a32.45bn for 100% of Sky Italia is a little lower than expected. For 21st Century Fox's 57% of Sky Deutschland, BSkyB is paying close to the minimum under German stockmarket rules. All the same, Sky Italia and Sky Deutschland could not be described as BSkyB's prettier sisters. Neither has come close to matching BSkyB's UK success. The Italian operation has shed subscribers in the last two years and made top-line profits of \u00a3250m last year, versus BSkyB's \u00a31.67bn. In Germany penetration rates for pay-TV are just 19%. Sky Deutschland, despite market leadership, made top-line profits of \u00a328m last year. Think of the scope for improvement, argues BSkyB. Fair enough, BSkyB is a business built on taking its chances. The interesting sub-plot, though, is how BT reacts. If it is serious about outgunning Sky for Premier League rights, this is the moment: BSkyB has just taken on a very large pile of debt. Tesco Tesco's chief executive Philip Clarke was one profits warning away from losing his job for at least 12 months, so it was no surprise that the axe should fall this week as current trading came in \"somewhat below expectations\". Yet the appointment of Unilever's Dave Lewis still carries a whiff of panic among Tesco's non-executive directors. A non-retailer to lead the country's biggest retail company? Are you sure? There is no rule that past retail experience is absolutely necessary, of course, and retailers can be sniffy about their supposedly unique talents. Lewis \u2013 who knows? \u2013 may turn out to be a miracle-worker. Yet it's hard to point to any feature of Unilever's recent corporate experience that has direct application at Tesco. Strong marketing always helps and Unilever's record is excellent. But a brand-led business selling soap and ice cream doesn't suffer property headaches, which is where many of Tesco's problems originate, as in too many big hypermarkets. At Unilever the key to revival in the early 2000s was the concentration of \"power brands\". At Tesco there isn't an option of shifting towards \"power supermarkets\", unless Lewis has something very radical up his sleeve. In the short term, the big question is whether Tesco should launch a price war and take the fight to Aldi and Lidl. There were whispers that Clarke was about to abandon his reluctance and ask the board to press the button. Any such plans will now be put on hold, presumably, while Lewis takes stock. He starts at Tesco in October, suggesting that it will be New Year, at the earliest, before a new plan is unveiled. Six months, including a Christmas, is a long time in the current climate for supermarkets, especially Tesco. After the initial excitement about the switch of boss, the shares ended the week 5% lower. That looks rational. There has been a profits warning and the next strategic move is up in the air. \"It is not an easy job,\" remarked Paul Polman, Lewis's current boss at Unilever, in less-than-uplifting matter. He's right though.",

      "bodyText": "Britain's economy has finally recovered the losses caused by the financial crisis, passing its pre-recession peak in the second quarter of the year by posting growth of 0.8%. The first estimate of growth between April and June showed the UK recovery is still on track, matching the 0.8% growth recorded in the first quarter. The data provided another boost to George Osborne, a day after the International Monetary Fund revised up its forecasts for the UK, putting it ahead of the other G7 economies. The chancellor said the prolonged downturn had left a deep mark on Britain. \"Thanks to the hard work of the British people, today we reach a major milestone in our long-term economic plan. But there is still a long way to go \u2013 the 'great recession' was one of the deepest of any major economy and cost Britain six years. \"Now we owe it to hardworking taxpayers not to repeat the mistakes of the past and instead to continue with the plan that is delivering economic security and a brighter future for all.\" The economy is now 0.2% bigger than it was in the first quarter of 2008, before the full force of the crisis hit. Growth in the second quarter was led by the services sector \u2013 including hotels, restaurants, tourism and the City \u2013 which accounts for around three-quarters of the economy and expanded by 1%. That was a stronger rate of growth for the services sector than the 0.8% achieved in the first quarter. Other sectors fared less well: manufacturing output grew by 0.2% between April and June, sharply lower than the 1.5% increase in the previous quarter. The broader measure of industrial production \u2013 which includes mining and utilities, as well as manufacturing \u2013 rose by 0.4%, following a 0.7% increase in the first quarter. The construction sector contracted, with a fall of 0.5%, and the agriculture sector also shrank, by 0.2%. Critics of the government's austerity policies pointed out that Britain has taken longer to recover than all other G7 countries apart from Italy, which remains about 9% below its 2008 peak. The almost six years it has taken to make up the lost ground beats the maximum four years it took in all previous recessions. Labour said the benefits of growth were unevenly spread and most workers, after six years of below-inflation wage rises, were being left behind. Ed Balls, the shadow chancellor, said: \"At long last our economy is back to the size it was before the global banking crisis \u2013 three years after the US reached the same point. \"But with GDP per head not set to recover for three more years and most people still seeing their living standards squeezed this is no time for complacent claims that the economy is fixed. Wages after inflation are down over \u00a31,600 a year since 2010, housebuilding under this government is at its lowest level since the 1920s, and business investment is lagging behind our competitors.\" Most analysts were optimistic about the prospects for growth over the next couple of years, despite the threat of interest rate rises by the Bank of England. Threadneedle Street is expected to begin pushing up base rates later this year or next spring, but only gently and to a maximum 3%. Capital Economics said it was confident GDP growth would exceed the IMF forecast of 3.2% this year and have staying power with 3% growth rates in 2015 and 2016. Samuel Tombs, the consultancy's senior UK economist, said: \"With some slack still left in the economy, confidence returning, credit constraints loosening and inflation easing, we believe the UK will experience another couple of years of robust growth and only gradual rises in interest rates.\" Business groups were more cautious about the prospects for growth. David Kern, chief economist at the British Chambers of Commerce, said: \"While it is welcome news that we have surpassed the pre-recession GDP peak of Q1 2008, this has occurred much later than in some of our major competitors, such as the US and Germany. \"It is important that we work to increase the contribution of exports and investment if this recovery is to become truly sustainable. In order to support the businesses driving the recovery, the Bank of England's monetary policy committee must provide assurances that interest rates will not be raised until there is a clear case to do so.\"",

This wouldn't be such a concern if it weren\u2019t for an outright fall in agriculture and construction output, and even a slip in manufacturing growth in the quarter.</p> <p>Despite the impressive headlines, the UK needs to remain vigilant to keep this recovery on track.

After the first oil shock in the mid-1970s, it took 12 quarters for the economy to return finally to its pre-recession level of output; after the recession in Margaret Thatcher's first term it took 16 quarters; after the recession following the Lawson boom of the late 1980s its took 10 quarters. This time it has taken 25 quarters.</p> <p>The second reason it makes sense for Osborne not to crow too much is that in terms of output per head of population, the downturn is still not over. The population has risen since the economy went into recession in early 2008 and at the current rate it will be 2017 or 2018 before the losses in per capita GDP are made up.</p> </blockquote> <h2>More here: <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/jul/25/george-osborne-gdp-growth-recession-population\">George Osborne is right not to be smug over GDP numbers</a></h2> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2014-07-25T11:04:35.970Z\">at 12.04pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-53d23453e4b0374e1a953817\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2014-07-25T10:50:22.627Z\">11.50am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Unions are flagging up up that most people are not feeling the recovery in their pocket:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/jessbrammar/statuses/492611586146988032\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>TUC on today&#39;s GDP figs: &quot;govt is overseeing economic growth driven by low-pay and low-productivity.

      "bodyText": "And finally over to Greece where the battle to stop Sunday Shopping reached new heights as the case was taken to the country\u2019s highest court. Our correspondent Helena Smith writes: The battle to stop what is taken for granted in most western economies \u2013 Sunday shopping \u2013 entered a new phase after federations representing thousands of shop owners, private employees and other tradesman resorted to the Council of State arguing that the court should declare the new law \u201canti-constitutional.\u201d Under pressure from the EU, ECB and IMF \u2013 the creditors who have bailed out the country to the tune of \u20ac240bn \u2013 the Greek government lifted the ban on Sunday shopping earlier this month. Prime minister Antonis Samaras\u2019 conservative-dominated coalition argues that deregulation of trading hours will help ease record levels of unemployment while increasing competition. But appealing to the court, employees and shopkeepers in both Athens and Thessaloniki countered that the new law \u2013 which mandates that shops open in ten tourist regions across Greece \u2013 contravenes European legislation. Moreover, they said, it violated the Geneva Human Rights convention which stipulates that workers enjoy a day of rest on Sunday. \u201cIt is exceptionally harmful for [all involved] as the competition will force employees to work the one day of the week that they had off,\u201d lawyers argued. The protestors responded to the first Sunday of liberalized shopping by going on strike \u2013 a move that is expected to be repeated in the weeks ahead. Small shop owners \u2013 already hit by higher utility bills and soaring taxes - insist that liberalization will favour big monopolies and other chain stores at a time when few can afford to hire extra personnel. After six straight years of recession \u2013 and with liquidity still at chronically low levels - most store staff have not been paid in months. And on that note, it's time to close for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we'll be back on Monday. After another volatile week, with investors unsettled by the continuing geopolitical tensions, leading shares fell back once more ahead of the weekend. Nervousness about Ukraine and the violence in Gaza dampened sentiment again, while on the corporate front disappointing results from Amazon and Visa helped send US shares lower. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished down 29.91 points or 0.44% at 6791.55 Germany's Dax dropped 1.53% to 9644.01 France's Cac closed 1.82% lower at 4330.55 Italy's FTSE MIB lost 0.9% to 21,063.31 But Spain's Ibex ended 0.25% higher at 10,888.1 Over on Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 126 points or 0.74%. And does the good news on GDP make the UK public feel better off? Apparently not... Back with UK GDP, and foreign exchange specialist Monex has warned against complacency (echoing Ed Balls earlier) despite the economy finally rising above the pre-crisis peak. Monex head of market analysis Eimear Daly said: The danger is that with the return of stellar growth, complacency may have set in, and details of the report show early signs that the UK is falling back into old habits. The greatest contributor to UK output was the services sector, expanding at an impressive 1%. Historically, the UK has depended on business services, which continues to power the economy. This wouldn't be such a concern if it weren\u2019t for an outright fall in agriculture and construction output, and even a slip in manufacturing growth in the quarter. Despite the impressive headlines, the UK needs to remain vigilant to keep this recovery on track. A top scoring services sector that creates impressive UK growth rates doesn\u2019t mean we can neglect the other sectors of the economy. The overall UK economy may have finally recovered from 2008, but the manufacturing and construction sectors remain much smaller than their pre-crisis level. The UK is at risk of forgetting the lessons of the crisis and depending all too heavily on services, especially financial, and leaving us at the mercy of the unpredictable financial markets. Wall Street has opened sharply lower, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average down around 90 points or 0.5% and the S&amp;P 500 off 7 points or 0.35% in early trading. Disappointing earnings from Amazon, whose shares are down 11%, and Visa, 4% lower, have contributed to the decline. The US durable goods figures could be a - mildly - positive sign for next week's GDP figures, said Rob Carnell at ING Bank: US Durable goods orders for June were slightly better than anticipated.... And this was largely the same story for the various core measures stripping out volatile transport and defence items. Ahead of next week\u2019s second quarter 2014 US GDP release, these figures take on added importance. And perhaps suggest a slightly stronger figure than the consensus 3.0% number (INGf forecast 4.6%). Moreover, the 3 month trend for core capital goods orders moved up to a respectable 6.7% (up from 4.1% in March), though it is not clear whether this or the capital goods shipments figure is the better indicator for business equipment investment. In any case, both strengthened a little from March. That said, it is another part of the investment category \u2013 inventories, which we believe will be the main distinguishing feature between ours, and the consensus forecast. Consequently, today\u2019s figures should not have a sizeable impact on market GDP expectations in advance of next week\u2019s figures. Over to the US where durable goods orders for June came in better than expected. The commerce department recorded a rise of 0.7% in longer lasting items such as machinery and electronic products and compared to forecasts of 0.5%. May\u2019s figure of -0.9% was revised upwards to -1.0% Aircraft parts showed the biggest rise at 15.3% but car parts orders fell 13.9%. Non-defence orders excluding aircraft rose 1.4% after a downwardly revised 1.2% fall in May. Time for a quick recap, with links to the main points in the blog. Britain has finally recovered all the output lost in the Great Recession, but MPs on all sides of the political divide say there is more to do to repair the economy. The Office for National Statistics reported this morning that UK GDP grew by 0.8% in April-June, confirming that Britain is growing much faster than its rivals this year. Finally, GDP is above the level reached in the first three months of 2008. But the growth wasn't very balanced - the service sector expanded by 1.0%, but industy only grew by 0.4% and both agriculture and construction shrunk. Chancellor George Osborne says: Thanks to the hard work of the British people, today we reach a major milestone in our long term economic plan. \u201cBut there is still a long way to go \u2013 the Great Recession was one of the deepest of any major economy and cost Britain six years.\" While shadow chancellor Ed Balls points out that the UK is three years behind other many other advanced nations: \u201cWith GDP per head not set to recover for three more years and most people still seeing their living standards squeezed this is no time for complacent claims that the economy is fixed. \u201cWages after inflation are down over \u00a31,600 a year since 2010, housebuilding under this government is at its lowest level since the 1920s and business investment is lagging behind our competitors. And the Green party have called for a major shake-up of the UK's 'broken' economy. Many economists have pointed out that the UK economy is still a long way from its 2008 peak when measured in terms of GDO per capita. Full analyst reaction starts here. Larry Elliott, our economics editor, says the chancellor is right to avoid smugness, given the bumpy road to get here. And writing in Comment is Free, Michael Burke argues that other economic figures show that Britain has NOT recovered. More workers should mean increased output. Yet while there are 180,000 more people in work than when the recession began, output is only now a fraction above its pre-recession starting point. And there is an increase of nearly 750,000 people who are economically inactive; that is unemployed, discouraged from work, retired early and so on. Jobs are being created, but not on the scale required to keep up with a growing workforce. This is six years of stagnation, not recovery. There is too a glaring problem with the nature of the jobs created under this government. It amounts to a farcical repeat of Thatcherite economic history. Over 100,000 estate agent and related new jobs have been created under the coalition, more than double the combined total for new manufacturing and construction jobs created over the same period. The grotesque merry-go-round of more people selling fewer overpriced homes is in full swing. Meanwhile, industrial production is back to levels first since in the beginning of 1988. And with that I'll hand over to my colleague Nick Fletcher. Have a good weekend all. Amid the flurry of data, reaction and charts, we haven't really touched on the wider question -- whether GDP is a good measure of economic well-being at all. Natalie Bennett, Green Party leader, has now flagged up some of the key concerns. One is the continued importance of Britain's financial sector, nearly years after the collapse of Lehman Brothers. As Bennett warns that the UK economy remains unbalanced: With the International Bank of Settlements, among many others, warning about the continued extreme fragility of the international financial sector of which the City of London is a notable risk-heavy and fraud-laden part, with an economy in which 20% of workers are on less than a living wage, millions working fewer hours than they'd like and households struggling to meet basic bills, there's no sign of real economic change. The Greens argue that Britain's \"broken economic model\" needs to change, with less focus on consumption and less power for multinationals. Bennett says: \"Today it's important to re-state that we need to transform it so that it works for the common good, not for the good of the few, within the limits of our one planet. \"We need to bring manufacturing and food production back to Britain, restore strong local economies built on small businesses and cooperatives. That means forcing multinational companies to behave like decent corporate systems - paying their way with tax and decent wages and conditions, and reining in our financial sector.\" \"And we need a massive cut in our use of the limited physical resources of this planet, along the lines of, but going much further, than that proposed this week by the Environmental Audit Committee report on the circular economy.\" That report, online here, warned that the government isn't giving enough leadership on the issue and that Britain could learn a lot from Japan. 10 things you need to know about MP's report on circular economy The first quarter of 2008 was also the time in which Northern Rock, stricken by the credit crunch, was formally nationalised by the Labour government. Northern Rock was later sold to Virgin Money. And today, they've announced they are creating 200 new jobs this year, including 120 in the North East. The announcement coincides with George Osborne's trip to Newcastle today. Here's a video clip of George Osborne explaining how Britain hasn't completed the task of recovering from the Great Recession. Rather than trudging back to 9.30am, new readers might prefer to read our news story on today's growth figures: GDP surpasses pre-recession high as economic growth hits 0.8% Our economics editor, Larry Elliott, says the chancellor is wise to resist crowing today (as I flagged up earlier, George Osborne tweeted that there's still \"a long way to go\" to complete the recovery). Larry writes: For one thing, this has been the mother and father of a recession and it has taken far longer than Osborne expected for the economy to respond to the Bank of England's cheap money medicine. There have been four deep downturns since the second world war; two presided over by Labour governments, two by Conservative. After the first oil shock in the mid-1970s, it took 12 quarters for the economy to return finally to its pre-recession level of output; after the recession in Margaret Thatcher's first term it took 16 quarters; after the recession following the Lawson boom of the late 1980s its took 10 quarters. This time it has taken 25 quarters. The second reason it makes sense for Osborne not to crow too much is that in terms of output per head of population, the downturn is still not over. The population has risen since the economy went into recession in early 2008 and at the current rate it will be 2017 or 2018 before the losses in per capita GDP are made up. More here: George Osborne is right not to be smug over GDP numbers Unions are flagging up up that most people are not feeling the recovery in their pocket: Wage growth, or rather the lack of it, is one of the clearest signs that Britain's recovery isn't feeding through to the workers. Pay rises have been lagging behind inflation since the crisis began, and hit their lowest level since 2001 in the three months to May (at just +0.7%). Today's GDP report is only the first stab at assessing the UK economy's performance in the second quarter of 2014. It doesn't actually contain any data from June at all -- the Office for National Statistics just estimates how the various sectors performed, based on history and the data from April and May. John Bulford, economic advisor to the EY ITEM Club, reckons the 0.8% growth reading could be revised up next month: The disparity between official figures, which show manufacturing output growing by just 0.2% and construction contracting by 0.5%, and business survey data, which show both sectors roaring ahead, is glaring. With that in mind, it would not be a surprise to see the Q2 figures revised up in the next release in mid-August.\u201d Guess who had another 'helpful suggestion'.... Ben Chu has pulled together another great chart, showing how Britain's GDP per capita (economic size divided by the total population) has also lagged most of the G7 group of advanced economies since 2008. Italy is the only member of the G7 to have recorded slower growth than the UK since the first quarter of 2008 That was the time when the credit crunch was transforming into the biggest financial crisis to grip the world since the Great Depression. Ben Chu of the Independent has helpfully tweeted this chart to show it: At which point, the Conservative team at the Treasury suggested he might like to rescale it to 2010 (when the coalition took power). Better, but still not top of the class... Guy Ellison at Investec Wealth &amp; Investment, says Britain's recovery has been \"a long slog\": The UK is the second to last member of the G7 group of economies to reach the milestone and took much longer to rebound than in past recessions. Geraint Johnes, director at Lancaster University\u2019s Work Foundation, has rubbished the notion that today's growth figures are a triumph for George Osborne's austerity programme. After all, the chancellor did (sensibly) drop the idea of eliminating the deficit in this parliament after it became clear that he was spiralling off course. Johnes says: \u201cWhat do the figures say about the effectiveness of austerity and the management of the economy? The Chancellor's actions trump his rhetoric. Austerity was effectively abandoned a couple of years ago, and the economy has flourished - albeit in patches - since. And next year's growth is unlikely to match the \"rather remarkable results\" being achieved at present, Johnes adds. Rob Wood, economist at Berenberg, agrees that growth was \"not balanced this quarter\": The service sector (+1.0%) was strong while manufacturing (+0.2%) and construction (-0.5%) were weak. The longer the recovery remains unbalanced the less sustainable it may seem to aim for growth continuing around these rates. That being said, manufacturing and construction suffered from an usually weak May and could bounce back strongly in June and through Q3 Manufacturing data from other European countries was also weak in May, suggesting the global economy had a hiccup. A lot of people are hammering home the fact that the UK's recovery has been the slowest in living memory. This tweet from RBS shows the tortoise-like nature of the rebound: And the FT explains just how badly it compares it to previous recessions over the last 100 years: Better late than never, George. That broadly sums up Ed Balls' response to the GDP data, who points out that America's economy hit its pre-crisis peak back in 2011. The shadow chancellor says: \u201cAt long last our economy is back to the size it was before the global banking crisis \u2013 three years after the US reached the same point. \u201cBut with GDP per head not set to recover for three more years and most people still seeing their living standards squeezed this is no time for complacent claims that the economy is fixed.\" Balls adds that Labour measures, such as more free childcare and a 10p starting rate of tax, will make the recovery fairer. More here. Jeremy Cook, chief economist at currency company World First, says the recovery is \"engendered, sustainable and flourishing\". \u201cOnce again, it was services that drove the economy onwards, rising by 1%. Construction slipped back in Q2, falling by 0.5% following a strong Q1 helped by home building and repair efforts to flooded properties in the west country. \u201cIndustrial production rose 0.4%. The recession prompted a renewal of the phrase \u201cKeep Calm and Carry On\u201d and all in the UK will be hoping that this expansion does just that.\u201d Simon Baptist, of the Economist Intelligence Unit, points out that the recovery has been \"notable for its extremely slow pace\": Austerity in this parliament has been a drag on growth. Markets needed to see a long term plan to big ticket items like pensions, healthcare and welfare spending; the government has done some of this for which it deserves credit, but growth now is in spite of austerity not because of it. Ben Brettell, senior economist at Hargreaves Lansdown, warns that the UK economy \"isn't as strong as it looks\". He also points out that GDP per person is still lagging (check out this chart) While it has surpassed its pre-crisis peak in absolute terms, a larger population means GDP per capita is around 6% lower. The economy has been growing by adding jobs, but there is an underlying issue with productivity, and this is why we are not seeing any meaningful increase in wages. Despite another upgraded growth forecast from the IMF I believe significant challenges lie ahead. I flagged this up earlier, but it really can't be repeated too many times: Britain's GDP per person is nowhere near the level it reached before the recession. The ONS hasn't issued a new estimate today but, based on earlier data, GDP per capita is probably at least 5% smaller than in 2008. The Liberal Democrats want their share of the credit, declaring that they have \"cleared up Labour\u2019s economic mess\". Lib Dem Treasury Minister Danny Alexander says Britain has passed a major milestone today. \u201cThe main reason that we stepped forward to form the coalition was to sort out Labour\u2019s economic mess and rebuild a stronger economy and a fairer society for the future. \u201cBy forming the coalition we gave the country a long term economic recovery plan based on Liberal Democrat values and policies and the stability to see it through.\" Chancellor George Osborne is touring the North of England today \u2013 designed to show that the government takes regional regeneration seriously. He's tweeting from Newcastle: Britain's manufacturing sector didn't enjoy a blowout quarter -- its activity expanded by just 0.2% in the April-June quarter, down from 1.5% in January-March. And here's confirmation that the 0.8% growth in the last quarter was almost totally due to the service sector (which makes up around three-quarters of the economy) Britain's agriculture sector also shrank during the quarter, by 0.2%. On an annual basis, the UK economy is 3.1% bigger than a year ago. The construction sector contracted during the quarter - with its output shrinking by 0.5%. Britain's industrial sector grew by just 0.4% in the quarter, a slowdown compared to the 0.7% in Q1. Britain's service sector continues to drive the recovery. It expanded by 1.0% between April and June, which is the strongest growth since the third quarter of 2012. The Office for National Statistics confirms that the UK economy is now 0.2% larger than at the previous peak, in the first three months of 2008. Here we go! The UK economy grew by 0.8% in the second quarter of this year. That's means Britain's GDP is finally above the previous peak set in 2008. Lots more detail and reaction to follow... Ed Balls has rather pre-empted today's growth figures, in an article in today's Guardian. In it, the shadow chancellor argues that there's no cause for complacent celebrations, just because GDP has reached its pre-crisis levels (assuming it does....) Not only is it two years later than the chancellor\u2019s original plan said, and three years after the US reached the same point, it\u2019s also the case that GDP per head won\u2019t recover to where it was for around another three years \u2013 in other words, a lost decade for living standards. Conservative complacency won\u2019t help working people Just over 20 minutes to wait until we learn how fast the UK economy grew in the second quarter of 2014. Paul Hollingsworth of Capital Economics says it will be \"another milestone for the recovery\", if GDP comes in at +0.8% as expected, 0.2% above the 2008 previous peak. There's a very important reason to be cautious about today's growth numbers, which explains why many people don't feel the benefits of the recovery. GDP per capita (ie, the amount of economic output divided by the number of people in Britain) is still more than 5% below the pre-crisis peak. As the ONS said this month, \"GDP per head has recovered relatively slowly since 2009\", and was 5.6%. This chart confirms it: Tax campaigner Richard Murphy comments: And that means almost everyone in this country is still worse off than they were in 2008. That\u2019s nothing for the government to celebrate. RBS isn't the only bank tackling \"conduct and litigation issues\", of course. Its UK rival, Lloyds Banking Group, has confirmed this morning that it is close to reaching a settlement over its role in Libor-rigging. This is the scandal in which traders allegedly conspired to fix benchmark interest rates that underpin many financial markets. Lloyds is expected to pay a fine of \u00a3200-\u00a3300m. Today's GDP figures should also show that the UK economy has grown for the last six quarters -- the longest sustained run of rising output since 2008. Royal Bank of Scotland has surprised the City by rushing out its results a week early, in the latest sign that conditions are improving in the UK economy. RBS, which was rescued by the taxpayer after the great recession struck, has reported an unexpected rise in pre-tax profits, thanks to a fall in bad loans and a general improvement in economic conditions. Shares surged by over 12% when trading began in London, even though CEO Ross McEwan cautioned that it still faces a number of \"conduct and litigation issues\". Here's our full story: RBS reports largest profits since bailout as share price soars To hit its pre-crisis peak, UK GDP must have risen by at least 0.6% in the last quarter, I reckon. Most economic data from April, May and June has suggested that growth remained quite strong, which is why economists expect GDP to have risen by 0.8% or 0.9%. It's wise to be cautious when economists talk about X or Y being the best or worst 'on record'. Reliable statistics don't go back terribly far -- for example, the central bankers faced with the Great Depression were hampered by limited knowledge about how their economies were faring*. But it's clear that this UK recovery has been the slowest in at least 100 years. This graph from the NEISR thinktank (which includes their estimate for today's GDP data) compares the last six recessions, going back to 1920. * - the excellent Lords of Finance explains this well. Good morning. After the longest downturn in recent UK economic history, has Britain's economy finally returned to the levels before the 2008 financial crisis? Economists think so, and we'll find out for sure at 9.30am this morning when the Office for National Statistics issues its first estimate of UK growth for the second quarter of 2014. The ONS is expected to report that GDP expanded by 0.8% or 0.9% between April and June. That would match, or exceed, the growth seen in the first three months of this year, showing that the UK recovery continues to outpace other advanced economies. And with an election just 10 months away, the figures are eagerly awaited in both Westminster and the City. Just yesterday, the International Monetary Fund upgraded its forecast for UK growth again \u2013 it now expects GDP to rise by a punchy 3.2% this year. Good news for George Osborne. IMF predicts Britain's GDP growth rate will surge to 3.2% by year end But critics of the chancellor argue that Britain is enjoying another of those consumer-driven recoveries that have caused such trouble in the past. So we'll be scrutinising today's data for evidence of whether the economy is really rebalancing, or not.",

      "bodyText": "A quarter of UK supermarkets granted planning permission during the past five years have either been cancelled or mothballed, new research reveals. The study commissioned for a Channel 4 Dispatches documentary, called Supermarket Wars, which airs on Monday \u2013 underlines how the sector is being battered by changing shopping habits, as customers shun large out-of-town stores in favour of smaller convenience stores. The switch in shoppers' behaviour has caused Tesco, Sainsbury's and Morrisons to announce huge write-downs on the value of their property portfolios, as they struggle to work out how to use the millions of square feet of land they have acquired but no longer need. Plans for 97 new stores have been abandoned or have stalled out of the 400 supermarkets approved by local authorities since 2009, Dispatches has found, with Tesco accounting for 60 of the 97 U-turns. The figures follow a Guardian study published in June that revealed how Tesco has been hoarding land and buildings on 310 sites and covering an area big enough to build 15,000 homes. Last week the UK's largest supermarket chain said it will begin making use of some of that undeveloped landbank, and announced plans to build 4,000 new homes. A spokesman for Tesco said: \"In response to changing customer shopping habits we have decided to reduce the amount of new space we build each year, building fewer large stores.\" Apart from Tesco, the data shows that Sainsbury's has retreated from 11 stores, Aldi from nine, the Co-op from seven and Morrisons from six. In contrast, Asda has abandoned plans for just one new store in the past five years, and a spokesman said: \"We've always taken a very cautious approach to property development. We've never been one for land banking.\" The programme also found that the supermarkets pulling back from plans has resulted in the cancellation of \u00a37.2m of section 106 planning obligations \u2013 the conditions local authorities attach to approving developments which are designed to benefit local communities. The effect means that 182 affordable houses and 314 retirement homes will no longer be built, while contributions to public art and recreational space now do not need to be made. Tesco added: \"The purpose of section 106 agreements is to mitigate the impact that a development would have on a local area. For example, they are often used to compensate for the cost of additional infrastructure that may be required, such as a new road junction. If the development doesn't take place, there is no impact to be mitigated.\"",

Nonetheless the FTSE 100 [closed] the week higher while the German Dax [ended] the week near on flat. This week's geopolitical tensions proved as short-lived as those from the annexation of Crimea as well as the emergence of the ISIS insurgents in Iraq. Overall, the bull market is being supported by very accommodative central banks including in the UK and US where the economies appear to be staging decent economic recoveries and in China which is growing by 7.5% per annum. Among the other risers, J Sainsbury added 3.2p to 320.2p on a report that the Qataris, holders of a near 26% stake as the legacy of a failed bid in 2007, could be interested in taking another tilt at the supermarket group. Vodafone was up 4.2p at 202.05p after it confirmed its outlook for the year despite a dip in first quarter revenue, thanks to a slowdown in Spain and South Africa. But BSkyB dropped 50.5p to 874.5p on news of the \u00a34.9bn purchase of Rupert Murdoch's pay-TV businesses in Germany and Italy. It helped pay for the deal with a placing of 156m shares at 870p each to raise \u00a31.35bn. Meanwhile GlaxoSmithKline fell 46.5p to \u00a314.23 as UBS cut its recommendation from neutral to sell and its price target from \u00a315 to \u00a313.80 in the wake of the pharmaceutical group's disappointing results and questioned whether the dividend was sustainable. United Utilities dipped 10p to 894p after an in line trading statement. In a hold note analyst Angelos Anastasiou at Whitman Howard said: There do not appear to be any surprises in this, with the trading update stating that \"current trading is in line with the group's expectations\". To reiterate, the outcome of the water price control review remains of greater interest, with United now awaiting its draft determination on 29 August, and we would still anticipate a reasonable final outcome here. The water subsector's takeover attractions remain over the medium term, but United has had a very strong run this year, and it is up 35% year to date. Leading the mid-cap index were Balfour Beatty, 21p better at 253.1p, and Carillion, up 24.3p to 362.8p, after the two construction groups confirmed reports they were in merger talks. Finally Greenko, a green energy company with wind and hydro assets, slipped 2p to 166p despite successfully issuing a $550m bond, believed to be the largest done by an Aim company. It was backed by institutional investors in the US, Asia and Europe, and should save the company around $15m a year in interest payments.",

A milestone had been passed, the chancellor said, but there is still plenty of work to do.</p> <p>This is a smart approach for a number of reasons. For one thing, this has been the mother and father of a recession, and it has taken far longer than Osborne expected for the economy to respond to the Bank of England's cheap money medicine.</p> <p>There have been four deep downturns since the second world war; two presided over by Labour, two by the Conservatives. After the first oil shock in the mid-1970s, it took 12 quarters for the economy to finally return to its pre-recession level of output. After the recession in Margaret Thatcher's first term it took 16 quarters, and after the recession following the Lawson boom of the late 1980s it took 10 quarters. This time it has taken 25.</p> <p>The second reason it makes sense for Osborne not to crow too much is that in terms of output per head of population, the downturn is still not over. The population has risen since the economy went into recession in early 2008, and at the current rate it will be 2017 or 2018 before the losses in per capita GDP are made up.</p> <p>The chancellor would very much like to see real incomes rise over the coming months, as that would help generate a pre-election feel good factor.

      "bodyText": "George Osborne's response to news that Britain has finally recovered all the ground lost in the recession of 2008 and 2009 was notably for its lack of crowing. A milestone had been passed, the chancellor said, but there is still plenty of work to do. This is a smart approach for a number of reasons. For one thing, this has been the mother and father of a recession, and it has taken far longer than Osborne expected for the economy to respond to the Bank of England's cheap money medicine. There have been four deep downturns since the second world war; two presided over by Labour, two by the Conservatives. After the first oil shock in the mid-1970s, it took 12 quarters for the economy to finally return to its pre-recession level of output. After the recession in Margaret Thatcher's first term it took 16 quarters, and after the recession following the Lawson boom of the late 1980s it took 10 quarters. This time it has taken 25. The second reason it makes sense for Osborne not to crow too much is that in terms of output per head of population, the downturn is still not over. The population has risen since the economy went into recession in early 2008, and at the current rate it will be 2017 or 2018 before the losses in per capita GDP are made up. The chancellor would very much like to see real incomes rise over the coming months, as that would help generate a pre-election feel good factor. In the absence of that, the best he can offer voters is that the mess left behind by Labour is finally being cleared up and that, provided policy remains unchanged, things will turn out well in the end. This is not an entirely convincing argument, but again it explains the lack of triumphalism. The recession of 2008 and 2009 was not simply the result of Gordon Brown \"failing to mend the roof while the sun was shining\". Rather it was a global downturn that hit Britain especially hard because of the economy's overreliance on the housing market and the City of London \u2013 long-running trends encouraged by both main parties. Osborne is clearly hoping that voters will forget the part he played in delaying the recovery \u2013 the increase in VAT, the deep early cuts in infrastructure spending, the misguided comparisons between Britain and Greece that affected business confidence \u2013 and he might be proved right. In terms of growth, however, this is probably going to be as good as it gets for the economy this side of the election. There are signs of a slight easing of activity, and the Bank of England is mulling when to start raising interest rates. The gap between wage growth and inflation has widened in recent months, while the strength of sterling has weakened exports. That's not to say the economy is about to go back into recession, because growth looks like being solid over the coming quarters. It is worth noting though that the government is reaping scant reward in the polls even though the economy has expanded by more than 3% over the past year and \u2013 according to the IMF \u2013 will be the fastest growing of the G7 economies this year.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Rupert Murdoch will collect nearly \u00a35bn after BSkyB agreed on Friday to buy out Sky Italia and Sky Deutschland from the media magnate's 21st Century Fox group. The transaction will give BSkyB 20 million pay-TV customers across Europe and is the biggest shakeup for the satellite broadcaster since it was created 24 years ago through the merger of Murdoch's Sky with British Satellite Broadcasting. Murdoch will maintain a foothold in the European pay-TV business through 21st Century Fox's 39.1% stake in BSkyB. \"The new Sky will be a world-class, multinational pay-TV business headquartered in the UK, anchored in Europe,\" said BSkyB's chief executive, Jeremy Darroch. \"It's the right time for Sky to make this move and we think it can create a lot of value for shareholders.\" The merger better positions BSkyB to compete with John Malone, a longtime Murdoch rival who is building Liberty Media into Europe's largest cable television business with control of Virgin Media and a slice of ITV in the UK. It also provides a buttress against the growing distribution might of Apple, Google, Amazon and Netflix, which are using the internet to build multibillion-dollar video businesses. With BSkyB's UK customer base now at 11.5 million, room for growth in its home market is limited. But pay television is less popular and less profitable in Italy and Germany, and the expanded business will operate in a market numbering 97m households, 66m of which have yet to take any form of pay TV. Over the last five years, BSkyB has more than doubled its paid-for subscription product base and increased revenues by 43% to \u00a37.6bn, while profits have increased 56% to nearly \u00a31.7bn. It says the expanded business \u2013 which will serve the UK, Ireland, Germany, Austria and Italy \u2013 could make similar gains. \"The headroom for growth in Italy and Germany is much greater,\" said Paul Richards, an analyst at Numis bank. \"BSkyB has executed really well in the UK over the last decade or two and is looking to export that capability into other markets in Europe.\" With increased annual revenues of \u00a311.2bn thanks to the contribution from its continental units, and a total of \u00a34.6bn to spend on screen each year, BSkyB claims it will have the biggest programming budget of any European broadcaster. As in the UK, BSkyB will offer its content not just over satellite but over the internet via its Now TV service, which is operated as a standalone brand to compete with pay rivals such as Netflix, and over mobile via its Sky Go platform or deals with operators such as Vodafone. However, its German and Italian businesses are not expected to follow the UK in offering broadband and phone calls for the time being. Darroch will continue to run the UK and Ireland arm but will expand his role to oversee the expanded business. He said BSkyB may cut some jobs but would probably increase overall headcount in each of its three main markets. By year two, he expects \u00a3200m in annual savings from jointly buying programmes, combining IT systems, producing live events, commissioning, rationalising suppliers and, over time, in product and set-top box development. In annual results released on Friday, BSkyB beat City forecasts on profits, reporting earnings per share of 60p against an expected 57.6p, while revenues came in as forecast at \u00a37.6bn, an increase of 5% on last year. Despite the battle for customers with BT and its new sports channels, Sky added 50,000 broadband customers in the most recent quarter, ending 30 June, and 76,000 television customers. BSkyB will issue 156m shares to fund the deal, equivalent to nearly 10% of its existing free float. Fox has committed to buying enough of these shares to maintain its current holding in Sky. The European deal will see BSkyB acquire 21st Century Fox's 57.4% interest in the German business for \u00a32.9bn, equivalent to \u20ac6.75 (\u00a35.35) per share, a slight premium to Thursday's closing price of \u20ac6.66 and the legal minimum it is obliged to offer under German takeover rules. The same sum has been offered to minority shareholders. Sky Italia is being acquired for \u00a32.45bn, made up of \u00a32.07bn in cash and the balance in the form of a stake in National Geographic which BSkyB is selling to 21st Century Fox for \u00a3382m. Meanwhile, 21st Century Fox is considering its next move in its attempted takeover of Time Warner. News broke last week of an unsolicited $80bn (\u00a347bn) offer for the Hollywood powerhouse behind Harry Potter and Game of Thrones. However, Murdoch tempered expectations that the proceeds from the BSkyB deal will be funnelled into a new Time Warner bid. The 21st Century Fox chief executive said the group's \"number one priority is increasing shareholder value in a disciplined manner\" and \"we will only consider transactions that fully support this objective\". Combining Time's HBO television production house and Warner Brothers with Fox would create a content giant capable of holding its own against the growing distribution might of Apple and Google's electronic entertainment stores, but with a competitively contentious 30% of US box office receipts. \"We have always believed that a combination of the European Skys would create enormous benefits for the combined business and for our shareholders,\" said James Murdoch, who is co-chief operating officer of 21st Century Fox. \"Ultimately, a pan-European Sky is good for customers, who will benefit from the accelerated technological innovation and enhanced customer experience made possible by a fully integrated business.\"",

It also provides a buttress against the growing distribution might of Apple, Google, Amazon and Netflix, which are using the internet to build multibillion-dollar video businesses.</p> <p>With BSkyB's UK customer base now at 11.5 million, room for growth in its home market is limited. But pay television is less popular and less profitable in Italy and Germany, and the expanded business will operate in a market numbering 97m households, 66m of which have yet to take any form of pay TV.</p> <p>Over the last five years, BSkyB has more than doubled its paid-for subscription product base and increased revenues by 43% to \u00a37.6bn, while profits have increased 56% to nearly \u00a31.7bn. It says the expanded business \u2013 which will serve the UK, Ireland, Germany, Austria and Italy \u2013 could make similar gains.</p> <p>\"The headroom for growth in Italy and Germany is much greater,\" said Paul Richards, an analyst at Numis bank. \"BSkyB has executed really well in the UK over the last decade or two and is looking to export that capability into other markets in Europe.\"</p> <p>With increased annual revenues of \u00a311.2bn thanks to the contribution from its continental units, and a total of \u00a34.6bn to spend on screen each year, BSkyB claims it will have the biggest programming budget of any European broadcaster.</p> <p>As in the UK, BSkyB will offer its content not just over satellite but over the internet via its Now TV service, which is operated as a standalone brand to compete with pay rivals such as Netflix, and over mobile via its Sky Go platform or deals with operators such as Vodafone. However, its German and Italian businesses are not expected to follow the UK in offering broadband and phone calls for the time being.</p> <p>Darroch will continue to run the UK and Ireland arm but will expand his role to oversee the expanded business. He said BSkyB may cut some jobs but would probably increase overall headcount in each of its three main markets.</p> <p>By year two, he expects \u00a3200m in annual savings from jointly buying programmes, combining IT systems, producing live events, commissioning, rationalising suppliers and, over time, in product and set-top box development.</p> <p>In annual results released on Friday, BSkyB beat City forecasts on profits, reporting earnings per share of 60p against an expected 57.6p, while revenues came in as forecast at \u00a37.6bn, an increase of 5% on last year.</p> <p>Despite the battle for customers with BT and its new sports channels, Sky added 50,000 broadband customers in the most recent quarter, ending 30 June, and 76,000 television customers. BSkyB will issue 156m shares to fund the deal, equivalent to nearly 10% of its existing free float. Fox has committed to buying enough of these shares to maintain its current holding in Sky.</p> <p>The European deal will see BSkyB acquire 21st Century Fox's 57.4% interest in the German business for \u00a32.9bn, equivalent to \u20ac6.75 (\u00a35.35) per share, a slight premium to Thursday's closing price of \u20ac6.66 and the legal minimum it is obliged to offer under German takeover rules. The same sum has been offered to minority shareholders. Sky Italia is being acquired for \u00a32.45bn, made up of \u00a32.07bn in cash and the balance in the form of a stake in National Geographic which BSkyB is selling to 21st Century Fox for \u00a3382m.</p> <p>Meanwhile, 21st Century Fox is considering its next move in its attempted takeover of Time Warner. News broke last week of an unsolicited $80bn (\u00a347bn) offer for the Hollywood powerhouse behind Harry Potter and Game of Thrones.</p> <p>However, Murdoch tempered expectations that the proceeds from the BSkyB deal will be funnelled into a new Time Warner bid. The 21st Century Fox chief executive said the group's \"number one priority is increasing shareholder value in a disciplined manner\" and \"we will only consider transactions that fully support this objective\".</p> <p>Combining Time's HBO television production house and Warner Brothers with Fox would create a content giant capable of holding its own against the growing distribution might of Apple and Google's electronic entertainment stores, but with a competitively contentious 30% of US box office receipts.</p> <p>\"We have always believed that a combination of the European Skys would create enormous benefits for the combined business and for our shareholders,\" said James Murdoch, who is co-chief operating officer of 21st Century Fox. \"Ultimately, a pan-European Sky is good for customers, who will benefit from the accelerated technological innovation and enhanced customer experience made possible by a fully integrated business.\"</p>",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Royal Bank of Scotland reported its highest first-half profits since its 2008 taxpayer bailout, surprising the City and sparking a sharp rise in the bailed out bank's share price. The 10% rise in the shares \u2013 adding \u00a33bn to the value of the taxpayer's stake \u2013 took place after it was forced to issue its figures a week early because of the bigger than expected improvement in profits to \u00a32.6bn for the first six months of the year. A year ago, when Ross McEwan was named as chief executive, the bank had reported a \u00a31.3bn profit. But even as the new boss hailed the steady progress shown in the results, he issued a cautionary note. \"Let me sound a note of caution. We are actively managing down a slate of significant legacy issues. This includes significant conduct and litigation issues that will likely hit our profits going forward.\" RBS put aside a further \u00a3150m to cover the cost of payment protection insurance claims \u2013 the most expensive mis-selling scandal in UK history - and also faces potential bills from other issues such as from legal action brought by investors relating to a cash call it conducted in 2008, just before its bailout. Despite the rise in the share price to 360p, it is less than the 500p average at which the taxpayer pumped in \u00a345bn to prevent the bank from collapsing during the 2008 crisis. McEwan said the timing of the sale of the taxpayer's 81% stake was in the hands of the government, but added: \"We're creating a really good bank so that any time the government chooses to sell a part or all of the business we're ready for it\". Another sign of the improving conditions was the move by the bank \u2013 the first in more than a decade \u2013 to write back provisions previously made for bad loans. Sir Philip Hampton, the bank's chairman, said: \"It is fair to say there is something of an element of a tipping point in these figures as it shifts a little bit more away from a banking dominated by stories of distress \u2026 toward a bank with more a focus on perform and capabilities of the business.\" Improving conditions in Ireland, where RBS owns Ulster bank, helped the results. The Irish operation has dented a \u00a315bn hole in the bank since the bail but reported a first half profitas bad debts fell to \u00a357m from \u00a3503m. The size of the Irish operation - subject to rumours of a link up with private equity - has been scaled back from offering \u00a330bn of mortgages a year to \u00a33bn. An impressive dramatic \u00a31.8bn fall in losses on bad debts to \u00a3269m fuelled the profit rise. The total amount of income RBS generated fell 6% to \u00a310bn although this was result of a decision to pull back from new business in its investment banking division. The rundown of non-core assets \u2013 RBS created a new mini bad-bank last year \u2013 is also proving to be less costly than feared and helped to bolster profits. McEwan it was \"not a bad thing\" that mortgage and housing mortgage market had cooled over the last two months but he conceded that RBS was still not granting enough new loans to outweigh the rate at which existing loans are being repaid. The banking sector was warned a week ago that it faced a full-blown competition inquiry into current accounts - a business dominated by the big four of RBS, Lloyds Banking Group, HSBC and Barclays - which will also include an analysis of free banking for customers in credit in their current accounts. McEwan, who is on a drive to cut back the array of products the bank offers and make the pricing clearer, said: \"I just don't think there is any such thing as free banking. We shouldn't be embarrassed about the pricing that is reflected in the cost of a product.\" The bank is facing controversy over the division which handles companies in distress \u2013 known as the global restructuring group \u2013 and this week two of its most senior executives were accused by MPs of being \"wilfully obtuse\" when giving evidence to the Treasury select committee. Hampton said he had written to Andrew Tyrie, the MP who chairs the select committee, yesterday. The vote on Scottish independence in September is hanging over RBS which is based in Edinburgh and McEwan said contingency planning was underway.",
