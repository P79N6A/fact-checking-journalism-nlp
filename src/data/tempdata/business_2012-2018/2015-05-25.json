      "bodyText": "The number of houses listed for sale for \u00a32m or more on the UK\u2019s main property websites has more than doubled in the two weeks since the Tories\u2019 general election victory quelled fears of a mansion tax. Properties such as the \u00a33.9m Manor House in Byfleet, Surrey, which featured in ITV\u2019s hit series Downton Abbey, were joined on estate agents\u2019 websites by hundreds of \u00a32m-plus homes, according to a report. In the runup to the election, estate agents and those buying homes for wealthy people reported a slowdown in the number of expensive properties coming on to the market as a result of uncertainty over who would form the new government. The Labour party\u2019s threat of an annual charge of properties worth \u00a32m or more had caused concern among buyers of high-end homes, and led would-be sellers waiting for the result of the election on 7 May . With the Conservatives winning an outright majority, worries over a mansion tax have subsided, and data from the GetAgent estate agent comparison website suggests sellers have returned to the market. GetAgent looked at listings on four property websites \u2013 Rightmove, Zoopla, OnTheMarket and Prime Location \u2013 in the four weeks to the election as well as the fortnight afterwards. In the week of 9 April, 246 homes were newly listed for sale at \u00a32m or more, while six weeks later the number had jumped to 639 \u2013 an increase of 160%. This compared with a 62% rise in new listings across all price brackets, from 5,093 to 8,269. Colby Short, co-founder of GetAgent, said: \u201cThe increase in the number of \u00a32m-plus properties listed after the election clearly demonstrates the effect that the possibility of the mansion tax was having on the high-end property market. The fall in demand for these kind of properties pending the outcome of the election saw owners holding off listing them.\u201d Henry Pryor, a property commentator and buying agent for wealthy clients, said: \u201cIt takes time to launch an expensive property properly \u2013 blue skies for the photos, and advertising deadlines for glossy magazines of two or three weeks all means sellers who waited for the results won\u2019t be bringing their properties to market for another week or so. Those who had already planned to sell are certainly doing so \u2013 their gamble of waiting having paid off but there is no deluge.\u201d In the days after the Conservative win, estate agents in the country\u2019s most expensive neighbourhoods reported a flurry of deals, with some saying that buyers were rushing to complete in case sellers put prices up. Pryor said he expected prices to remain constrained at the top of the market, with the stamp duty changes introduced in December 2014 squeezing those buying expensive homes. \u201cSomeone buying a \u00a32m property doesn\u2019t face Labour\u2019s \u00a3250 monthly mansion tax but does have to find \u00a3153,750 out of taxed income \u2013 53% more than they would have needed 12 months ago. There will continue to be trophy sales that will hit the headlines, but the wealthy still feel under the spotlight.\u201d In April, the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors said the number of homes coming on to the market had fallen for a second month running, and the sharp increase in new listings more generally is likely to be welcomed by buyers. The GetAgent figures show the number of homes listed at up to \u00a3500,000 increased by 66% to 4,028 between the week beginning 9 April and that beginning 14 May.",

      "bodyText": "The high-stakes game of brinkmanship between Greece and its creditors intensified on Monday after prime minister Alexis Tsipras convened an emergency meeting of his political negotiation team following a stark warning from Athens that default was looming. Amid mounting fears of financial collapse, Tsipras instructed officials to act speedily as his government sought to defuse tensions saying it would do its best to honour its debts \u2013 even if it failed to reveal how, exactly, it would find the money to pay \u20ac1.6bn in loans to the International Monetary Fund next month. Technical teams are set to resume talks in Brussels on Tuesday. \u201cWe are very close to a deal,\u201d the finance minister Yanis Varoufakis told reporters. \u201cThere are many different Germans, just as there are many different Greeks,\u201d he said responding to reports that Berlin would not be prepared to retreat in what has become an all-out tug of war between the two governments. Technical teams tasked with negotiating the framework of a cash-for-reform deal to keep the debt-stricken nation afloat, are now scrambling to break the deadlock of almost four months of fruitless talks. Both sides have signalled they will focus on VAT increases, expected to raise as much as \u20ac1bn for the Greek economy, when they reconvene in Brussels on Tuesday. Also on the table are pension reform, labour deregulation and the ever-incendiary topic of the primary surplus. Tsipras\u2019s anti-austerity administration has argued vociferously that demands for a budget surplus higher than 1.5% will exacerbate the country\u2019s economic death spiral. The IMF, which wants Greece to achieve a 3% budget surplus as a minimum requirement before releasing bailout funds, has consistently questioned the Greek finance ministry figures put forward since January, when the threat of bankruptcy hit tax receipts and pushed the budget into deficit. Olivier Blanchard, the IMF\u2019s chief economist, told the French newspaper Les Echos that revising this surplus downwards would lead to new financing needs for which Greece would again need European help. This could only work if, in exchange, Greece presented a coherent programme, he said. \u201cConsidering that the most recent estimates mention a substantial budget deficit, we need credible measures to transform this into a surplus and maintain this surplus in the future,\u201d Blanchard was quoted as saying. \u201cThis is far from being the case at the moment.\u201d The urgency to draw a line under a crisis that has tormented Greeks, and haunted Europe, was thrown into stark relief at the weekend when Athens signalled that the endgame was near. European stock markets and the euro fell sharply on Monday after the the Greek interior minister, Nikos Voutsis, suggested that Greece would be unable to repay \u20ac1.6bn to the IMF next month because it had run out of money. Athens\u2019 debt repayment schedule becomes even more punishing in July and August when it will be called to hand over some of a \u20ac6.7bn loan to the European Central Bank. Asked about the debt repayment it must make to the IMF on 5 June, Voutsis told Mega TV: \u201cThe money is not there to be given and will not be given.\u201d The leftist-led government has repeatedly said that if faced with the choice of honouring creditor obligations or paying salaries and pensions, it would opt for the latter. Failure to honour the IMF debt repayment would almost certainly set in motion the groundwork for Greece\u2019s exit from the eurozone. Since 2010, the Washington-based body, along with the EU and ECB, has given Greece an estimated \u20ac240bn in rescue loans \u2013 the biggest bailout in global financial history. Cut out of international markets, and unable to issue short-term debt, Athens has been forced to sequester the cash reserves of state bodies \u2013 including its embassies \u2013 to pay bills. Greece has not received any bailout aid since August as both sides have haggled over the extent to which it should continue with austerity policies \u2013 the price of emergency funds and for the government, the root of the country\u2019s recession-driven decline. \u201cWe are seeking a deal that will give prospect to the country and will take it out of the cycle of austerity and recession,\u201d the interior minister told the leftwing radio station Kokkino. \u201cThere is not going to be a second generation of compromise, concessions and austerity measures.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "A former trader will become the first person to face a judge over allegations of conspiracy to rig the crucial Libor benchmark interest rate, when he goes on trial on Tuesday. Tom Hayes, a former UBS and Citigroup trader, 35, will appear at Southwark crown court to face charges of conspiring to rig the London interbank offered rate (Libor) \u2013 a key benchmark in determining the cost of $450tn (\u00a3291tn) worth of borrowing for households and companies. A total of 21 individuals face similar charges, but Hayes will be the first to stand trial when he appears in court before the high court judge, Mr Justice Cooke. The case is seen as a crunch test for the Serious Fraud Office, whose reputation has been battered after a series of high-profile mishaps, including the collapse of a costly inquiry and accidentally sending bags of confidential papers to the wrong witness. Hayes faces eight counts of conspiracy to defraud covering 2006-10, offences that carry a maximum jail sentence of 10 years. He has pleaded not guilty. The trial, which is expected to last 10-12 weeks, will focus on his activities working for UBS and Citigroup in Tokyo, where he was trading derivatives linked to the Japanese yen. He is accused of conspiring with seven former employees at UBS, two at JP Morgan two at Citigroup and individuals at RBS, Deutsche Bank, Rabobank and HSBC. Prosecutors allege that Hayes played a central role in the alleged Libor conspiracy. The SFO\u2019s legal team will have to prove that he \u201cdishonestly\u201d made false or misleading submissions to benefit his own trading book, while deliberately disregarding the proper basis for making submissions and prejudicing the economic interest of others, according to the indictment. Born in west London, Hayes began his career at the Royal Bank of Scotland, where he worked from 2001-03. He joined UBS in 2006, where he generated $260m for the bank over a three-year period. His success brought him to the attention of headhunters and he was persuaded to join Citigroup in 2010, but left after 10 months. The former trader, who lives in Surrey, has been described by acquaintances as shy, gifted and socially awkward. Although he almost certainly once earned a six-figure salary, he now receives legal aid to pay his lawyers\u2019 bills. He was arrested by the SFO in December 2012, shortly before receiving an indictment from the US Department of Justice, which is still pending. The case will revisit the frantic days of the 2008 financial crisis, when banks stopped lending to each other. At that time the Libor system was administered by the lobbying group the British Bankers\u2019 Association , arrangements later described as \u201ca fox guarding the henhouse\u201d. Banks have been fined billions by regulators to settle Libor cases, while several senior bankers lost their jobs over the scandal. Most recently Deutsche Bank was fined a record $2.5bn (\u00a31.7bn) for rigging Libor, coming after penalties for Barclays, UBS, Rabobank and the broker RP Martin.",

      "body": "<p>A former trader will become the first person to face a judge over allegations of conspiracy to rig the crucial Libor benchmark interest rate, when he goes on trial on Tuesday.</p> <p>Tom Hayes, a former UBS and Citigroup trader, 35, will appear at Southwark crown court to face charges of conspiring to rig the <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/libor\">London interbank offered rate (Libor)</a> \u2013 a key benchmark in determining the cost of $450tn (\u00a3291tn) worth of borrowing for households and companies.</p> <p>A total of 21 individuals face similar charges, but Hayes will be the first to stand trial when he appears in court before the high court judge, Mr Justice Cooke. </p> <p>The case is seen as a crunch test for the Serious Fraud Office, whose reputation has been battered after a series of high-profile mishaps, including <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://uk.businessinsider.com/ico-fined-the-serious-fraud-office-for-evidence-blunder-over-bae-systems-and-saudi-arabia-investigation-2015-3\">the collapse of a costly inquiry </a> and <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://uk.businessinsider.com/ico-fined-the-serious-fraud-office-for-evidence-blunder-over-bae-systems-and-saudi-arabia-investigation-2015-3\">accidentally sending bags of confidential papers</a> to the wrong witness.</p> <p>Hayes faces eight counts of conspiracy to defraud covering 2006-10, offences that carry a maximum jail sentence of 10 years. He has pleaded not guilty.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>The trial, which is expected to last 10-12 weeks, will focus on his activities working for UBS and Citigroup in Tokyo, where he was trading derivatives linked to the Japanese yen. He is accused of conspiring with seven former employees at UBS, two at JP Morgan two at Citigroup and individuals at RBS, Deutsche Bank, Rabobank and HSBC.</p> <p>Prosecutors allege that Hayes played a central role in the alleged Libor conspiracy. The SFO\u2019s legal team will have to prove that he \u201cdishonestly\u201d made false or misleading submissions to benefit his own trading book, while deliberately disregarding the proper basis for making submissions and prejudicing the economic interest of others, according to the indictment.</p> <p>Born in west London, Hayes began his career at the Royal Bank of Scotland, where he worked from 2001-03. He joined UBS in 2006, where he generated $260m for the bank over a three-year period. His success brought him to the attention of headhunters and he was persuaded to join Citigroup in 2010, but left after 10 months.</p> <p>The former trader, who lives in Surrey, has been described by acquaintances as shy, gifted and socially awkward. Although he almost certainly once earned a six-figure salary, he now receives legal aid to pay his lawyers\u2019 bills. He was arrested by the SFO in December 2012, shortly before receiving an indictment from the US Department of Justice, which is still pending.</p> <p>The case will revisit the frantic days of the 2008 financial crisis, when banks stopped lending to each other. At that time the Libor system was administered by the lobbying group the British Bankers\u2019 Association , arrangements later described as \u201ca fox guarding the henhouse\u201d.</p> <p>Banks have been fined billions by regulators to settle Libor cases, while several senior bankers lost their jobs over the scandal. Most recently Deutsche Bank was fined a record $2.5bn (\u00a31.7bn) for rigging Libor, coming after <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/apr/23/libor-rigging-fines-a-timeline\">penalties for Barclays, UBS, Rabobank and the broker RP Martin</a>.</p>",
