      "bodyText": "The Financial Conduct Authority did a fine thing when it imposed price caps on payday lenders two years ago. The policy was popular and addressed obvious abuses. It was also well-crafted: payday lenders did not disappear altogether, which might have caused even nastier operators to fill the demand, but the survivors were obliged to clear up their acts. The regulator should take its cue from that success and see if there is a robust way to design a price cap for rent-to-own companies such as BrightHouse that provide household goods via hire purchase agreements at sky-high rates of interest. The failings identified by the FCA, for which BrightHouse will pay \u00a314.8m in redress, are not directly linked to the cost of the contracts. Instead, the company, owned by private equity outfit Vision Capital, did not properly assess customers\u2019 ability to pay and should have refunded some payments. But the FCA now knows what it is dealing with: an ugly industry with too few controls. BrightHouse\u2019s redress payments will go to an astonishing 249,000 customers. These were not isolated incidents. The FCA\u2019s reluctance to impose a price cap on the rent-to-own industry seems to stem from a supposed technical difficulty. If interest rates were capped, operators might simply inflate the base price of the goods, leaving customers no better off. But that challenge doesn\u2019t seem insurmountable. It just needs imagination to solve. Citizens Advice, which has been calling for years for price caps to be extended to all forms of high-cost credit, should keep pressing. Nobody would pretend that a price cap is a cure-all, just as it isn\u2019t in the energy market \u2013 but, in a rent-to-own market where the odds are stacked against customers, it would be a useful start. Costa v \u2018third wave of coffee\u2019 Costa Coffee is a simple business. It sells cups of coffee, over-priced pastries and, more recently, keener-priced bacon rolls. But it seems we\u2019ve over-looked the greater forces at play. \u201cThe UK is entering the third wave of coffee,\u201d declared Alison Brittain, chief executive of parent Whitbread in an odd departure from her usual plain-speaking style. In the new era, consumers will become \u201cmore sophisticated\u201d in their coffee tastes and be more willing to pay more per cup. Well, maybe, but it\u2019s so tricky to keep track of these waves. Allegra, a coffee industry body also cited by Brittain, reckons it has already identified the fifth coffee wave. This one, supposedly, is characterised by \u201csmart boutique concepts\u201d and started in the mid-2010s. That doesn\u2019t sound like Costa at all. Brittain, one assumes, pitched her wave theory to try to reassure investors that like-for-like sales at Costa haven\u2019t gone permanently flat. If so, she failed \u2013 Whitbread\u2019s shares fell 5%. Yet City chatter about whether the UK coffee market is close to saturation feels like a sideshow. The key point about Costa is surely that it still generates a return on capital of 40%, which is a good reason to keep opening more stores. Besides, Premier Inn is a much bigger business for Whitbread and looks as reliable as ever. Underlying profits from the budget hotels improved almost 9% to \u00a3295m over the half-year. For its next trick, Whitbread hopes to cover Germany with Premier Inns, which would be a significant financial bet. If that plan works \u2013 and if returns match those in the UK \u2013 Costa\u2019s current flat sales will be irrelevant. Gadhia\u2019s right to expose Goldman Sachs\u2019 reluctance on gender equality Jayne-Anne Gadhia, chief executive of Virgin Money, is entirely justified in asking why Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan haven\u2019t signed the government-backed charter to promote gender balance in the City. Almost every other financial institution, from big firms like Barclays and Deutsche to tiddlers like the South Manchester Credit Union, have committed to linking executive pay to goals to improve gender equality. Goldman Sachs\u2019 explanation is especially feeble. This, remember, is an investment bank that drones on about how its people are one of its main assets and that \u201cbeing diverse is not optional, it is what we must be\u201d. Goldman pleads that it supports the review\u2019s objectives but \u201cas a global firm, it is challenging for us to make a regional commitment by signing up to the charter\u201d. Sorry, but that doesn\u2019t wash: other global firms, such as HSBC and the Prudential, see no difficulty and have signed. Gadhia was also on the money when she suggested that dreary City dinners, dominated by \u201cmen in dinner suits\u201d, would benefit from a shake-up. She was at this month\u2019s City banquet at the Mansion House and a tally of the list of guests explains why she would be shocked. There were 240 men and 73 women. Her idea that half the invitations should be sent to women in future is excellent.",

      "bodyText": "And finally, here\u2019s our latest Brexit dashboard, showing the state of the UK economy. It\u2019s not a very cheery picture this month: And on that note, it\u2019s time to wrap up. Thanks for reading and commenting. GW A quiet day in the City ended with the FTSE 100 up just 20 points. Mining firms had a good day, led by Antofagasta which gained 2.8%. Whitbread led the fallers, though, after the slowdown at its Costa Coffee chain disappointed analysts. Some were also concerned that the occupancy rate at its Premier Inn hotel chain had slowed. The pound has also lost ground, and is now down 0.5% against the US dollar at $1.3128. Bad news 2: World wine production has dropped to a 50 year low, after spring frosts and summer heatwaves ravaged Europe\u2019s tender vines. Bad news 1: Britain\u2019s mountain of consumer debt is reaching dangerous levels, according to credit rating agency S&amp;P. Back to gender equality in the City, or rather the lack of it. My colleague Jill Treanor reports that two of the world\u2019s biggest banks - Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan- haven\u2019t yet signup to the government\u2019s new charter aimed at addressing the issue.... Newsflash from America: US companies are growing at a faster rate this month. Data firm Markit\u2019s manufacturing PMI, which tracks activity at US factories, has jumped to 54.5 in October, from 53.1 last month. The services sector also picked up pace, with its PMI rising to 55.9 from 55.3. That implies that the US economy continues to grow at a healthy rate. Over in Moscow Cyprus\u2019 head of state Nikos Anastasiades is holding talks with president Vladimir Putin on the second day of an official visit aimed at strengthening economic ties between the two countries. Cyprus is without doubt Russia\u2019s friendliest EU member state and this afternoon the Greek Cypriot president Nicos Anastasiades went out of his way to make the point. \u201cI may say that this visit is in the framework of those fine relations between the Republic of Cyprus and the Russian Federation,\u201d said Anastasiades making his third visit to Moscow since becoming president. \u201cWe want to inform the Russian leadership about recent developments in the Cyprus issues, discuss issues related to ties with the European Union and Russia, essential regional issues and the possible role of Cyprus in solving them.\u201d The Greek Cypriot leader is expected to sign a number of treaties with Putin raising the total number of bilateral agreements to 67. A joint action plan for the period 2018-2020 will seek to reinforce, political, economic, defence and energy ties between the two with ministers from both countries signing pacts on maritime and road transport, communications and information technology. The Cypriot government is also seeking to raise the number of Russian tourists from 900,000 to one million over the coming year. \u201cWe are constantly striving towards improving air connectivity between our two countries, which in principle is one of the major priorities of my government, and also focusing on enhancing the experience for Russian tourists by offering more and more qualiuty services,\u201d Anastasiades said. More than 40,000 Russian citizens live permanently on Cyprus, prompting the community to field a Russian party in presidential elections due early next year. Caterpillar\u2019s strong results have helped to send the US stock market to fresh record highs, once again.... Caterpillar, the machinery and construction giant, has smashed Wall Street forecasts. The firm, famous for its yellow diggers, hiked its profit forecasts and announced that revenues had surged by 25% to $11.4bn in the last quarter. Caterpillar, which is a good barometer for the global economy, reported growing strength in a number of areas, including China\u2019s construction sector and North America\u2019s oil and gas industry. Matt Arnold, an analyst at Edward Jones &amp; Co, says: \u201cResults were better than expected across the board, with construction, mining, energy all strong,\u201d This has sent the company\u2019s shares up by over 6%, to a new all-time high. John Mann MP has now issued a statement, criticising the Bank of England for not appointing more women to top jobs (an issue raised earlier). He argues that the BoE should widen its recruitment pool - perhaps even adding a trades union leader such as Frances O\u2019Grady to the monetary policy committee.... Mann says: \u201cLast week, the appointment of Sir Dave Ramsden to the Deputy Governorship at the Bank of England was confirmed. It is shameful that when so many talented women are at the forefront of the private sector, the trade union movement and the academic world, institutions like the Treasury and the Bank of England keep turning to the same group of men to fill their appointments. I hope to see an increasingly diverse range of nominees come before the Treasury Committee as new vacancies arise\u201d In the Bank\u2019s defence, it has appointed several women to the MPC in recent years, such as Kristin Forbes and Minouche Shafik. Both have since left, though, leaving the Bank\u2019s top committees looking terribly male (apart from the newly appointed Silvana Tenreyro, of course). Speaking of Greece.... the country\u2019s third bailout review began in earnest today. And, for once, the visit by international monitors appears to have got off to a good start! Helena Smith reports from Athens. A first round of talks between inspectors representing debt-stricken Greece\u2019s international creditors and finance ministry officials has begun in optimistic mood. A senior finance ministry source said the country\u2019s projected primary surplus would well exceed 1.75% of GDP in 2017. That would underline how fiscal indicators have improved \u2013 and boosts hopes that the review will be wrapped up without negotiations becoming tortuous or prolonged. Greek government sources have welcomed the European Stability Mechanism\u2019s announcement that a decision will finally be made on Thursday as to whether Athens should receive a remaining bailout disbursement of \u20ac800m in aid. Release of the funds will ultimately depend on progress the Greek state had made in clearing arrears. Late Monday the normally acerbic Eurogroup chairman Jeroen Dijsselbloem echoed the optimism telling an audience in Ireland that Greece\u2019s bailout programme was back on track and that fellow eurozone members were prepared to do more to manage the county\u2019s staggering debt mountain if called for. Dijsselbloem declared: \u201cWe have managed to help the debt burden, a lot has been done there. We stand ready, if they do their part, to do more if necessary. At the end of the programme in the summer next year, we will look again at how sustainable the debt is.\u201d Over in Berlin, Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble has formally stepped down as Germany\u2019s finance minister and taken up a new position as president of the Bundestag. And to mark the occasion, hundreds of finance ministry staff assembled themselves into a big fat zero for a photo which was presented to Sch\u00e4uble last night. That may sound like a curious move - but it\u2019s really a tribute to Sch\u00e4uble\u2019s determination to balance Germany\u2019s budget and deliver a zero deficit. Countries who suffered badly during the eurozone crisis might feel a different send-off is in order, given Schauble\u2019s opposition to Greece getting debt relief. Marcus Walker of the Wall Street Journal reckons there\u2019s a hidden meaning behind the photo. Sir Jon Cunliffe isn\u2019t the only BoE policymaker sounding wary of raising interest rates next month. Last week, fellow deputy governor Sir Dave Ramsden revealed that he wasn\u2019t in the majority of MPC members who felt, in September, that a rate rise was close. The Bank, which hasn\u2019t raised interest rates for a decade, will remember the experience of the European Central Bank; it hiked, prematurely, in 2011, and was later forced to cut into negative territory to stimulate the economy. But, having insisted several times that a rate hike is coming, can governor Mark Carney really fail to deliver? He already has a reputation as an \u2018unreliable boyfriend\u2019, having abandoned his earlier forward guidance on when rates would go up. As Bloomberg\u2019s David Goodman puts it: Carney also has to worry about credibility. He has previously come under fire for hinting at rate increases that never arrived, with one lawmaker branding him an \u201cunreliable boyfriend\u201d in 2014. That label has stuck with him ever since, and, even though he has stuck resolutely to the MPC\u2019s \u201ccoming months\u201d language in recent comments, he\u2019s under pressure to deliver this time. Sterling has fallen a little this morning, following BoE deputy governor Sir Jon Cunliffe\u2019s cautious words about interest rates. The pound has lost a quarter of a cent against the US dollar, to $1.317, and a similar amount against the euro to below \u20ac1.12. Traders are taking note of Cunliffe\u2019s hint that he might not vote to raise borrowing costs at next month\u2019s meeting, as UK growth is weak and real wages are falling. Paresh Davdra, CEO of RationalFX, says Cunliffe\u2019s comments have put the pound under pressure: Analysts have typically favoured the pound as the likelihood of a rate rise increases, and so any signals to the contrary could weigh on sterling. Incidentally, this chart shows how the pound\u2019s slump after last year\u2019s EU referendum caused a spike in inflation, and a long-term impact on prices too.... Virgin Money boss Jayne-Anne Gadhia also told the Treasury committee about how sexism used to be rife in the financial sector. She explained that during her time at Royal Bank of Scotland.... \u201cThere was a very male culture and I\u2019ve talked previously about part of that being the sort of win-lose culture. \u201cUndoubtedly there was a pervading sexism where I remember a very senior woman being very upset one day telling me that she was expected to sleep with her boss. \u201cThat sort of thing of course means that there are issues for women in progressing through financial services.\u201d The BBC has more details. Jayne-Anne Gadhia also suggested there was no excuse for the Bank of England not to have a decent number of women in senior positions. Currently the Financial Policy Committee is entirely male, while Silvana Tenreyro is the only woman on the Monetary Policy Committee. But, Gadhia tells the Treasury Committee, women such as (IMF chief) Christine Lagarde and (Fed chair) Janet Yellen have proved that gender is no barrier. John Mann MP agrees.... Over in parliament, Jayne-Anne Gadhia, the CEO of Virgin Money, has been discussing how to tackle gender imbalances in Britain\u2019s financial sector. She told the Treasury committee that Virgin Money have used blind recruitment processes to give all applicants a fair chance, and training to help staff avoid their own \u2018unconscious biases\u2019. She argues that a senior manager, such as the chief executive, needs to be held accountable for helping address gender imbalances, and pay disparities. Here\u2019s her four-part plan: A clear strategy for tackling workplace inequality Make it measurable Make someone responsible for it \u2014 at 70% of firms it\u2019s the CEO Attach someone\u2019s bonus to it Gadhia says that she asks for \u2018balanced recruitment lists\u2019 for senior positions, to give a roughly equal number of men and women to choose between. Gadhia adds that the companies who are tackling gender inequality best are those who treat it as a business issue, not simply an HR one - and implement policies such as flexible working. This is an important issue for Gadhia, who was appointed the government\u2019s gender diversity Champion last year. She says she\u2019s pleased that the Bank of England has just signed the government\u2019s Women in Finance Charter. Some major firms still aren\u2019t on the list, though, she adds.... Newsflash: The eurozone\u2019s collective government debt pile has shrunk, as a percentage of the region\u2019s economy. Eurozone government debt was equal to 89.1% of GDP at the end of June, down from 89.2% in the first quarter of 2017. That\u2019s despite a rise in the annual deficit in the second quarter of the year: Today\u2019s purchasing managers report shows that Europe\u2019s recovery is still strong, says economist Rupert Seggins: Jon Ferro of Bloombeg points out that manufacturing is leading the way: But the team at Sigma Squawk are concerned that the service sector slowed this month: Newsflash: Companies across the eurozone are growing at a slower rate than expected this month. The Composite Purchasing Managers Index has dropped to 55.9, down from 56.7 in September. That\u2019s a weaker reading than expected, but still shows solid expansion (anything over 50 shows growth). Europe\u2019s factory sector is having a good month - with the manufacturing PMI accelerating to 58.6, from 58.1. That suggests that activity is rattling along. But the services PMI dropped to 54.9, from 55.8 - a weaker reading than forecast. Markit reports that Germany and France were the \u201cgrowth drivers\u201d, while peripheral countries lagged behind. Whitbread\u2019s claim that Britain is entering a third wave of coffee drinking, and happy to pay more for more complicated brews, might amuse their rivals at McDonalds..... Whitbread shares have fallen by over 4% in early trading, as traders react to the slowdown in sales and falling profits at its Costa Coffee chain. Like-for-like sales at Costa only rose by 0.1% in the three months to 31 August, in \u201ctough market conditions\u201d, the company reported this morning. That\u2019s a pretty sharp slowdown -- sales grew by 1.1% in the previous quarter. And it hit the bottom line -- statutory pre-tax profit at Costa fell by almost 10% in the last six months, from \u00a365m to \u00a359m. This has sent Whitbread sliding the bottom of the FTSE 100 leaderboard, despite reporting a 7% rise in underlying profits across its business (which includes Premier Inn hotels). Nicholas Hyett, Equity Analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, says Whitbread is suffering from rising cost pressures and a slowing economy: Whitbread will be well aware of the pressures facing the purses of UK consumers. Weaker like-for-like numbers this time round will add to worries that customers are feeling the pinch.\u201d So, is Britain\u2019s love affair with coffee (yum yum!) fading? Not according to Whitbread; they reckon we\u2019re entering the \u2018third wave\u2019, which is... a period in which consumers\u2019 preferences for coffee become more sophisticated and are willing to spend more per cup for higher quality and innovative drinks.

Sign up here. Sir Jon Cunliffe also warned European cities that they won\u2019t knock London off its perch as the region\u2019s financial centre, despite Brexit. He told the Western Mail that some City banks will move operations over the Channel, or even the Atlantic, once Britain leaves the European Union. That could be bad news for jobs and tax receipts down the line. But this doesn\u2019t mean that Frankfurt, Paris or Dublin can supersede London, Cunlifee argues: We have an expertise in financial services and we have a critical mass of talent and deep knowledge and those sort of big economic agglomerations and economic activity exist because they add value and they reduce costs. \u201cIt may be that some activities that are carried out in London have to move to the continent. And maybe some activities carried out in London no longer become efficient, and rather than moving to the continent, they just go back to New York or somewhere else, or maybe they don\u2019t happen at all. \u201cBut I don\u2019t see London as a financial centre being replicated on the continent anytime soon as it takes an awful lot of critical mass of expertise and knowledge.\u201d One of the Bank of England\u2019s top policymakers has cautioned against assuming that UK interest rates will rise next month. Sir Jon Cunliffe, deputy governor at the BoE, says that with the UK economy suffering weak growth it is an \u201copen question\u201d whether the Bank will raise borrowing costs in November. Speaking on a trip to Wales, Cunliffe told the Western Mail that UK workers are suffering falling real wages (due to the spike in inflation since the Brexit vote). And while interest rates are certain, in his view, to be higher in three years time - there\u2019s no guarantee that the first hike in a decade is imminent. Mr Cunliffe told the Western Mail that the UK economy has \u201cclearly slowed\u201d, and that any rate rises will be gradual. As he put it: \u201cIn our August forecast we forecast that rate of growth [GDP] of about 1.5% a year, and it is going to continue for the next two to three years. And pay is going to gradually pick up from around 2% to around 3.5% by the end [three year forecast period]. \u201cAnd that is going to put some domestic pressure on inflation, as the imported inflation eases off. Now if that forecast comes to pass over the forecast period, interest rates will need to go up. \u201cThey will not need to go up by as far and as fast as they did before the crisis, but over the forecast period of three years rates will need to rise. The exact timing of when that starts? Well, that for me is a more open question.\u201d The Bank\u2019s Monetary Policy Committee\u2019s next meeting is on November 2nd. Back in the summer, we got several hints that the MPC was close to voting to raise rates from their record low of 0.25%. But, with Brexit uncertainty weighing on companies, and wages only rising by 2.1% per year (compared to inflation at 3%), perhaps the committee is having second thoughts.... Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Today we get our first insight into how Europe\u2019s economy is performing this quarter, with the \u2018flash\u2019 survey of purchasing managers at companies across the eurozone. City analysts expect to learn that Europe\u2019s factories and service sector companies are still expanding steadily this month. The headline eurozone composite PMI is expected to come in at 56.5 for October, down slightly on September\u2019s 56.7, but still showing strong growth. Analysts at Royal Bank of Canada explain: The PMIs ended the second quarter higher than they begun it, suggesting some pick-up in momentum toward the quarter\u2019s end and the continued strength of new orders in both the manufacturing and services sectors suggests that should continue into the third quarter. Over in parliament, the Treasury Committee is holding an inquiry into women in finance (why there aren\u2019t more of them, and why more don\u2019t rise to the top). Jayne-Anne Gadhia, the CEO of Virgin Money, will give her insight. After yesterday\u2019s profits warning from UK car dealer Pendragon, the City is chewing through results from hotels and coffee chain Whitbread, packaging firm Bunzl, carpet seller Carpetright and publishing group Bloomsbury. There don\u2019t seem to be any shockers, although Whitbread has only reported a small rise in sale at Costa Coffee. Financial analyst Chris Bailey has helpfully summarised the details: Any ideas?... Here\u2019s the agenda 8am BST: French \u2018flash\u2019 manufacturing and services PMI for October. 8.30am BST: German \u2018flash\u2019 manufacturing and services PMI for October. 9am BST: Eurozone \u2018flash\u2019 manufacturing and services PMI for October. 9.15am BST: UK Treasury Committee hearing on Women in Finance, with Jayne-Anne Gadhia, CEO of Virgin Money. 2.45pm BST: US \u2018flash\u2019 manufacturing and services PMI for October.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "A worker filmed changing food safety records at the scandal-hit 2 Sisters chicken plant in West Bromwich has been sacked, in what appears to be the first admission by the company of a regulatory breach. The disciplinary action can be revealed as the country\u2019s largest supplier of supermarket chicken faces a parliamentary inquiry on Wednesday, in the wake of a Guardian and ITV News investigation into standards at the plant. Separately, it has also emerged that the West Bromwich factory was temporarily stripped of its Red Tractor food safety and traceability accreditation. It is understood that the worker \u2013 who was witnessed by a Guardian and ITV undercover reporter being instructed by a supervisor to change the kill dates on crates of chicken \u2013 was dismissed by company executives citing allegations he had breached \u201cfood safety regulations\u201d. The dismissal took place in the same week that 2 Sisters repeatedly claimed to investors that there had been no breaches of food safety at the factory. During a conference call on 3 October, the finance chief, Richard Pike, said: \u201cThere have been no breaches of food safety regulations.\u201d In the same call, the chief operating officer, Martyn Fletcher, added: \u201cThere were no actual breaches found by the Food Standards Agency \u2026 and our own internal investigations would say the same.\u201d In August, the Guardian and ITV recorded undercover footage showing an instance of 2 Sisters workers altering the source and slaughter date of poultry being processed at the firm\u2019s Site D plant in West Bromwich. Experts said altering \u201ckill dates\u201d could artificially stretch the commercial life of the meat and dupe consumers into buying chicken past its use-by date. It is illegal to place incorrect use-by dates on food, which are set for safety reasons and differ from \u201cbest before\u201d dates. The company also told investors there was \u201cno evidence of any such breach in that regard\u201d. Other 2 Sisters workers have also told the Guardian and ITV that they have been instructed to alter kill dates. On the day after the footage was aired last month, Marks &amp; Spencer, Aldi and Lidl all announced they had suspended deliveries from the 2 Sisters plant, while Sainsbury\u2019s and Tesco followed suit over the following two days, with the company then suspending production at the factory. M&amp;S said the footage showed unacceptable standards and also pulled chicken sourced from the plant from its shelves. The Food Standards Agency (FSA) \u2013 which had conducted nine audits at the site, five of them unannounced, in the months of July and August \u2013 launched its own investigation. It is looking at 11 2 Sisters sites in England and Wales, while its Scottish counterpart has said it is looking at one plant. The FSA has said it had not found any threats to public health at the West Bromwich factory, but that it had identified issues requiring management attention. The investigation is ongoing and is centred on food hygiene and labelling. The food regulator, along with the British Poultry Council and Assured Food Standards, which promotes and regulates food quality and licenses the Red Tractor quality mark, will all be appearing in front of the Commons\u2019 environment, food and rural affairs committee on Wednesday to answer questions about the scandal. They will be followed by Ranjit Singh Boparan, the multimillionaire founder of 2 Sisters, which is the UK\u2019s second largest food company by turnover and claims to process about 6 million chickens every week. A spokesman for Red Tractor said: \u201cFood safety and traceability sit at the heart of Red Tractor. In light of the allegations made by ITV and the Guardian, Red Tractor launched its own, independent investigation at 2 Sisters \u2018Site D\u2019. As a result of this and 2 Sisters\u2019 own admissions of issues, we suspended the site\u2019s licence to use the Red Tractor logo on 3 October. \u201cSince the suspension, Red Tractor has conducted a more extensive investigation, including an audit of Site D. Some issues were found, although none relating to food safety. Red Tractor requested detailed information on the corrective actions 2 Sisters are making, considering the issues identified. These actions, together with 2 Sisters\u2019 own corrective measures, gave us the confidence to reinstate the Site D licence on 9 October.\u201d A spokesman for 2 Sisters said that two individuals \u201cwere identified and went through our disciplinary procedures\u201d, with the first admitting guilt and being \u201cdisciplined accordingly, retrained and reinstated in his position\u201d. He added that the second worker denied his involvement and has been dismissed after being identified by 10 witnesses. The spokesman did not make any comment on the sacked worker being instructed by a supervisor to change the slaughter dates, or say specifically why 2 Sisters was disciplining employees for alleged breaches of \u201cfood safety regulations\u201d while simultaneously telling investors there had been none. He said the directors\u2019 comments to investors \u201cwere related to the FSA statements and they had found no breaches\u201d.",

But it did not fear any system-wide impact from consumer credit. \u201cLoose monetary policy, cheap central bank term funding schemes and benign economic conditions have supported consumer credit supply and demand,\u201d S&amp;P said. Annual growth rates in UK consumer credit of 10% a year have outpaced household income growth, which is closer to 2%, and become a focus for the Bank which is scrutinising lenders\u2019 approach to the sector. \u201cWe believe the double-digit annual growth rate in UK consumer credit would be unsustainable if it continued at the same pace,\u201d S&amp;P said. The warning came as research by data firm Moneyfacts showed that credit card rates were at their highest level in 10 years at 23% and warned that customers might not be able to keep hopping from one interest rate-free period to another. S&amp;P\u2019s analysis said these interest rate-free periods had increased to 28 months and had been \u201ccontributing to overall household indebtnesss\u201d. Last month, the Bank said UK lenders could incur \u00a330bn of losses on their lending on credit cards, personal loans and for car finance if interest rates and unemployment rose sharply, and told them they would need to hold \u00a310bn more capital to protect against losses. Next month, each lender will find out how much extra capital the Bank will expect them to hold against these type of losses. S&amp;P said those lenders which had relaxed the criteria on how they grant loans or expanded their lending rapidly \u201chave the potential to be overexposed when supportive economic conditions deteriorate\u201d. The Bank\u2019s monetary policy committee will meet next week and could raise interest rates for the first time since July 2007, before the onset of the financial crisis when rates were eventually cut to 0.5%. In the aftermath of the Brexit vote, rates were cut to 0.25%. S&amp;P said that amid fierce competition in the consumer credit market, banks had not had to grapple with the consequences of higher rates and the need to pull back lending growth, particularly in the credit card sector. \u201cBanks\u2019 discipline in constraining risk appetite for new underwriting and risk-based pricing in a hot market has not been seriously tested since the financial crisis,\u201d S&amp;P said. A rate rise could put further pressure on the consumer credit sector if it pushes up mortgage rates as \u201can individual is more incentivised to meet mortgage repayments relative to an unsecured personal loan or credit card\u201d. While lending for car financing has been growing faster than the overall consumer credit sector, S&amp;P said it was less risky to lenders than personal loans or credit cards. Much of the lending also takes place outside the banking sector, where Lloyds is the largest player but still has less than 3% of its overall loan book exposed to car finance, S&amp;P said. There are also signs it is slowing after the warning on Monday by Pendragon, the UK\u2019s biggest car dealer, that demand for new cars was sliding and the market had peaked.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Sales growth at Costa\u2019s established outlets has almost ground to a halt, in a sign UK coffee drinkers may be turning away from the large chains in favour of artisan alternatives. Costa\u2019s like-for-like sales rose just 0.1% in the three months to the end of August, compared with the 1.1% in the previous quarter. Three years ago sales were soaring by 7% a year. The flat sales growth at established Costa stores helped push parent company Whitbread\u2019s shares down nearly 5% to \u00a337.58 by mid-afternoon on Tuesday, the biggest faller in the FTSE 100. They closed down 4.5% at \u00a337.64. The slowdown in sales has come at the same time as costs are rising. The cost of importing coffee has gone up as a result of the fall in the value of the pound since the Brexit vote, while the chain is also facing higher labour costs linked to the introduction of the national living wage and apprenticeship levy, and higher business rates. As a result first-half operating profit at the chain fell 4.6% to \u00a361m. The decline was despite an 8.3% rise in total sales as Costa opened 108 new outlets in the UK. It now has a total of 2,326 British stores and has installed hundreds more coffee machines in locations such as offices and petrol stations. The massive expansion in the number of coffee shops on UK high streets over the past 20 years was initially driven by large chains such as Costa and Starbucks. However, Whitbread\u2019s chief executive, Alison Brittain, said the UK was \u201cnow entering the \u2018third wave\u2019 of coffee\u201d in which coffee lovers develop more sophisticated tastes and were \u201cwilling to spend more per cup for higher quality and innovative drinks\u201d. She said the change was similar to one that took place in the wine market, where UK consumers once drank \u201cBlack Tower and Blue Nun\u201d but could \u201cnow probably can tell the difference between a chardonnay and a sauvignon blanc\u201d. Brittain said sales were falling at some high street outlets amid changing shopping habits, but added that there was an opportunity for a mainstream coffee shops to entice people with more sophisticated drinks. UK consumers still drink far less coffee a head than people in the US several other parts of the world. Industry analysts Allegra have predicted there will be further growth in the market, and are forecasting annual increases of up to 6% in the number of UK coffee shops for the next few years. But growth will be harder to find for the big chains. The rise of internet shopping and low consumer confidence have led to quieter high streets, which is affecting all coffee shops, cafes and some restaurants as well as retailers. McDonald\u2019s, Marks &amp; Spencer, department stores, Waitrose, pubs and petrol forecourts are all competing for a slice of the coffee market. Jeffrey Young, an analyst at Allegra , said Costa had not done enough to cater to the more demanding tastes of younger shoppers amid the rise of small chains which offered better quality coffee and food such as Caravan, Grind, Gail\u2019s or Taylor St Baristas. He said that while Costa was considering the third wave of coffee, the market had already moved on. \u201cWe are in the fifth wave of coffee, a new era of professional, well-funded businesses set up by smart people that appeal to millennials and people with discerning tastes who want quality and fresh food and nice design.\u201d He said Costa and Starbucks had tried to adapt to the third wave shift towards artisan coffee shops by introducing flat whites, brick walls and beaten-up sofas, but this was no longer enough. Young added: \u201cThe coffee industry needs to put its foot on the innovation accelerator and to work a lot harder to deliver value. Brands like Costa have become a little bit ordinary.\u201d Whitbread said it planned to continue opening stores in the UK and would also be expanding in China and Germany. Pretax profits for the whole Whitbread group, including Premier Inn, rose 20% to \u00a3316m in the six months to the end of August as total revenues rose 7.4%. Sales growth at established Premier Inns slowed in the second quarter, falling to 2.6% from 4.7% in the previous three months. But the company opened 2,000 more rooms over the period, via new hotels and extensions.",

    "webTitle": "Virgin Money boss criticises US banks' failure to join gender equality charter", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Jayne-Anne Gadhia, the chief executive of Virgin Money, has pointed the finger at Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan for failing to sign up to the government-backed charter to promote gender balance in the City. Gadhia, who designed the 10-point charter to boost gender equality in the financial sector, did not name the two banks but told MPs on the Treasury select committee: \u201cThere are two investment banks that I would have liked to have signed up that haven\u2019t yet.\u201d An update to the 141 signatories to the \u201cwomen in finance charter\u201d dated Tuesday [pdf] shows JP Morgan and Goldman Sachs have yet to add their names. Gadhia was addressing the select committee at the start of a new inquiry into women in finance. She told MPs there was a \u201cpervasive\u201d sexism in the financial services industry and began by recalling an incident she outlined in her book, published earlier this year, where she described the experience of a female colleague at Royal Bank of Scotland who believed she was expected to sleep with her manager. Gadhia quit RBS in 2006, before its taxpayer bailout. She was speaking on the day it emerged that Virgin Money was in talks to appoint a female chair \u2013 Irene Dorner, who used to run HSBC\u2019s US operations \u2013 in a move that would make it one of the few companies in the FTSE 350 to have an all-female team at the top. Virgin Money would not comment on the report. Signatories to the women in finance charter must commit to link executive pay to goals to improve gender equality in their organisations. Gadhia dismissed as \u201cnonsense\u201d the excuse given to her by one of the investment banks, which insisted it could not sign up because it was a global business. Firms that did not sign up to the charter were driven by profit motives, she said. Gadhia called on MPs to summon them to explain their reluctance. \u201cBusiness has a responsibility to society and the organisations that have signed up appear to adhere to that view ... The organisations that are more insular and driven by their own profit motive see that as a less important point,\u201d said Gadhia. One of the highest-profile and most senior women in the banking sector, Gadhia told the MPs about her discussions with senior men. She said one male executive had told her he was worried about promoting women because they got pregnant, while the head of an insurance company insisted he could not find women who were good enough for senior roles. It was important to \u201ccall out\u201d such attitudes, said Gadhia. She also talked about formal City dinners at the Mansion House \u2013 where figures such as the Bank of England governor, Mark Carney, give set-piece speeches each year. She said the events were dominated by \u201cmen in a dinner suit ... It\u2019s shocking.\u201d Gadhia suggested that half the invitations for these dinners should be sent to women. To encourage firms to focus on the gender issue, she said companies should be required to include reports on diversity in their annual reports in the same way as they update investors on environmental issues. Banks could be required to hold more capital if their boardrooms are not diverse. The select committee has expressed concern about the lack of women on senior committees at the Bank of England. There are no women among the 11 members of the financial policy committee, which monitors financial stability, and only one woman on the the Bank\u2019s 12-strong prudential regulation committee, which polices banks and insurance companies. The Bank of England signed the diversity charter this week. JP Morgan said: \u201cWe\u2019re supportive of the goals of the charter and are open to signing it as the programme develops.\u201d Goldman Sachs said it was \u201csupportive of this review from the outset and endorse its objective of increasing the representation of women in senior management roles in financial services\u201d.",

      "body": "<p>Jayne-Anne Gadhia, the chief executive of Virgin Money, has pointed the finger at Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan for failing to sign up to the government-backed charter to promote gender balance in the City.</p> <p>Gadhia, who designed the 10-point charter to boost gender equality in the financial sector, did not name the two banks but told MPs on the Treasury select committee: \u201cThere are two investment banks that I would have liked to have signed up that haven\u2019t yet.\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/654215/Women_in_Finance_Charter_list_of_signatories__October_2017_.pdf\">An update to the 141 signatories to the \u201cwomen in finance charter\u201d dated Tuesday</a> [pdf] shows JP Morgan and Goldman Sachs have yet to add their names.</p> <p>Gadhia was addressing the select committee at the start of a new inquiry into women in finance.</p> <p>She told MPs there was a \u201cpervasive\u201d sexism in the financial services industry and began by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/apr/20/virgin-money-chief-jayne-anne-gadhia-battled-with-mental-health-all-my-life\">recalling an incident she outlined in her book,</a> published earlier this year, where she described the experience of a female colleague at Royal Bank of Scotland who believed she was expected to sleep with her manager. Gadhia quit RBS in 2006, before its taxpayer bailout.</p> <p>She was speaking on the day it emerged that Virgin Money was in talks to appoint a female chair \u2013 Irene Dorner, who used to run HSBC\u2019s US operations \u2013 in a move that would make it one of the few companies in the FTSE 350 to have an all-female team at the top. Virgin Money would not comment on the report.</p> <p>Signatories to the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/women-in-finance-charter\">women in finance charter</a> must commit to link executive pay to goals to improve gender equality in their organisations. Gadhia dismissed as \u201cnonsense\u201d the excuse given to her by one of the investment banks, which insisted it could not sign up because it was a global business.</p> <p>Firms that did not sign up to the charter were driven by profit motives, she said. Gadhia called on MPs to summon them to explain their reluctance.</p> <p> \u201cBusiness has a responsibility to society and the organisations that have signed up appear to adhere to that view ... The organisations that are more insular and driven by their own profit motive see that as a less important point,\u201d said Gadhia.</p> <p>One of the highest-profile and most senior women in the banking sector, Gadhia told the MPs about her discussions with senior men. She said one male executive had told her he was worried about promoting women because they got pregnant, while the head of an insurance company insisted he could not find women who were good enough for senior roles. It was important to \u201ccall out\u201d such attitudes, said Gadhia.</p> <p>She also talked about formal City dinners at the Mansion House \u2013 where figures such as the Bank of England governor, Mark Carney, give set-piece speeches each year. She said the events were dominated by \u201cmen in a dinner suit ... It\u2019s shocking.\u201d Gadhia suggested that half the invitations for these dinners should be sent to women.</p> <p>To encourage firms to focus on the gender issue, she said companies should be required to include reports on diversity in their annual reports in the same way as they update investors on environmental issues. Banks could be required to hold more capital if their boardrooms are not diverse.</p> <p>The select committee has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/oct/20/chancellor-philip-hammond-asked-address-lack-of-diversity-bank-of-england\">expressed concern about the lack of women on senior committees at the Bank of Englan</a>d. There are no women among the 11 members of the financial policy committee, which monitors financial stability, and only one woman on the the Bank\u2019s 12-strong prudential regulation committee, which polices banks and insurance companies. The Bank of England signed the diversity charter this week.</p> <p>JP Morgan said: \u201cWe\u2019re supportive of the goals of the charter and are open to signing it as the programme develops.\u201d </p> <p>Goldman Sachs said it was \u201csupportive of this review from the outset and endorse its objective of increasing the representation of women in senior management roles in financial services\u201d.</p> <p> </p>",

      "bodyText": "The food produce destroyed by droughts would be enough to feed a country with a population the size of Germany\u2019s every day for a year, the World Bank has reported. In a new study, it said, the \u201cshockingly large and often hidden\u201d consequences of prolonged periods without rain threatened to stunt the growth of children and condemn them to a lifetime of poverty. The report said the lost food production related to drought would feed more than 80 million people every day for a year, adding that while floods and storm surges had an immediate impact, droughts were \u201cmisery in slow motion\u201d. The World Bank said women that were born in droughts bore the marks for their entire lives, growing up mentally and physically stunted, undernourished and unwell. New data shows that women born during droughts had less access to education, had more children and were more likely to suffer from domestic violence. Problems caused by droughts were passed on to the next generation, leading to a vicious cycle of poverty. Droughts reduce crop yields, forcing farmers to expand into nearby forests, the Bank said, adding: \u201cSince forests act as a climate stabiliser and help regulate water supplies, deforestation decreases water supply and exacerbates climate change.\u201d For firms, the economic cost of a drought was four times as big as a flood, it said. Guangzhe Chen, senior director of the World Bank\u2019s water global practice, said: \u201cThese impacts demonstrate why it is increasingly important that we treat water like the valuable, exhaustible, and degradable resource that it is. We need to better understand the impacts of water scarcity, which will become more severe due to growing populations and a changing climate.\u201d The World Bank said that many of the countries affected by drought overlapped with areas already facing large food deficits and that were classified as fragile, heightening the need to tackle the problem. Its report recommended constructing new water storage and management infrastructure, coupled with a strategy to control the demand for water. It urged tougher regulation of utility companies operating in cities so that they are given incentives to invest and improve their performance. Safety nets should also be put in place to help families cope when droughts turned into economic shocks. \u201cIf we don\u2019t take deepening water deficits and the bigger and more frequent storms that climate change will bring seriously, we will find water scarcity spreading to new regions of the world, potentially exacerbating issues of violence, suffering, and migration,\u201d said the report\u2019s author Richard Damania. \u201cCurrent methods for managing water are not up to the challenge. This sea-change will require a portfolio of policies that acknowledge the economic incentives involved in managing water from its source, to the tap, and back to its source.\u201d",

Hollywood\u2019s latest book hits the shelves next Thursday \u2013 two days after the final of the first series of Channel 4\u2019s new-look Bake Off is broadcast. \u201cIt will be huge, no doubt about it,\u201d said Nigel Newton, chief executive of Bloomsbury. \u201cCookery books, both from the brilliant Paul Hollywood and other major chefs, have been a major strength of the industry over the last decade.\u201d Channel 4 poached Bake Off from the BBC in a \u00a375m three-year deal. A spin-off show starring Hollywood, also called A Baker\u2019s Life, begins broadcasting in November \u2013 perfect timing to promote his new book in the run-up to Christmas. He was offered the four-part show as part of an estimated \u00a31.5m three-year deal to keep him with the Bake Off franchise. Hollywood was the only one of the BBC\u2019s original lineup of fellow judge Mary Berry, and co-hosts Sue Perkins and Mel Giedroyc to make the move to Channel 4. Newton cited cookery publishing as one of Bloomsbury\u2019s \u201cgreat strengths\u201d \u2013 this year\u2019s hits include Tom Kerridge\u2019s Lose Weight for Good and Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall\u2019s River Cottage Much More Veg. Hollywood\u2019s \u00a325-a-pop Bloomsbury book How to Bake has shifted more than 200,000 copies since its publication in 2012, according to Nielsen Book Research. Newer releases by the baker have seen diminishing returns. His most recent one, The Weekend Baker, published by Michael Joseph, has sales of only 11,000. However, Hollywood remains a star baker in the publishing stakes, having sold almost 700,000 books, worth more than \u00a37m, in the last five years, according to Nielsen. Bloomsbury, which also publishes the Harry Potter books, reported strong first-half trading, with revenues climbing 15% to \u00a372m in the six months to the end of August, as JK Rowling\u2019s boy wizard franchise shows no signs of slowing down, 20 years after the first book was published. The franchise saw a 40% sales revenue surge in the first half, driving a 33% surge in revenues in its children\u2019s publishing arm as special editions and spin-offs continue to prove popular. The publisher is also benefiting from George Saunders\u2019s Man Booker prize win for Lincoln in the Bardo, with Newton saying that it has seen a \u201ctremendous boost in sales\u201d since the award last Tuesday.",

      "bodyText": "Ryanair has delayed its stricter cabin bag policy in the latest turnabout by the beleagured budget airline. The company told its passengers in September that from 1 November they would have to pay \u00a35 for priority boarding to avoid having their main cabin bag checked in to the hold at their departure gate. Following the flight cancellations fiasco that grounded 400,000 ticket holders, however, and a continuing fight with pilots over pay, Ryanair said it would delay the new bag policy until mid-January. The airline said customers needed more time to get used to the policy, particularly with the busy Christmas period just weeks away. Ryanair\u2019s head of marketing, Kenny Jacobs, said: \u201cWe will delay the introduction of our new cabin bag rules until 15 January 2018, to allow our customers more time to familiarise themselves with the policy changes.\u201d The new policy will prevent passengers from bringing a wheelie-size bag into the aircraft unless they have paid for priority boarding. Passengers who have not done so can still go to the departure gate with a wheelie bag and a small secondary bag \u2013 such as a handbag \u2013 but the larger bag will be taken away and put in the hold. Travellers will then have to wait at their destination airport for the bag to be delivered on carousels. Ryanair is also increasing the maximum weight for checked-in luggage from 15kg to 20kg. The airline said the new bag policy was essential because there was not enough overhead cabin space for the volume of carry-on bags that passengers were bringing on board, which it said was causing boarding and flight delays. Ryanair said in September the move would cost it \u20ac50m (\u00a344.6m) in reduced fees for checked baggage, but critics regard it as a ruse to increase the number of people paying for priority boarding. The delay to the bag policy comes as the airline\u2019s battle with its pilots continues. Those at its main base, Stansted airport near London, voted overwhelming on Friday to reject a higher pay offer. It is understood that 90% of the 480 pilots at Stansted voted 62% to 38% to reject the offer of \u00a311,000-\u00a322,000 extra in bonuses and allowances. The rejection, at a time when Ryanair is battling to keep pilots that have been defecting to Norwegian.com and other competitors, came days after pilots at its Madrid base also rejected the offer. Pilots at several other bases have accepted the offer, the airline said. Ryanair\u2019s shares have fallen in value from a peak of \u20ac19.39 in July before the cancellation debacle to \u20ac15.67 in early trading on Tuesday.",

      "bodyText": "David Blanchflower Professor of economics at Dartmouth College, New Hampshire, and member of the Bank of England\u2019s monetary policy committee (MPC) from June 2006 to May 2009 The big news this month was the mea culpa from the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) that they had got it all wrong for years. They admitted the 16 forecasts they had done since they were set up had under-estimated the impact of austerity on output. In each of the disastrous 16 they predicted that productivity would rise like a rocket when in fact it has remained as flat as a pancake. Despite the fact that growth never happened they continued to forecast each successive time that output per man would follow exactly the same path; so there was no learning. Output per man hour today is essentially unchanged ever since the austerity was imposed by the coalition. This means the OBR\u2019s next forecast which will come in November for the budget will inevitably mean their predictions for growth will have to be slashed by at least half. As a consequence, the public finances are in much worse shape than the chancellor has claimed, given there is likely much less growth. It remains unclear whether the OBR are just incompetent or are the government\u2019s poodle. The public pays for this nonsense. Fears of Brexit continue to have a major negative effect on the economy. The fall in the pound, which picked up recently, has had a major impact on inflation, which hit 3% this month. Inflation will likely fall back in 2018 as these one-off effects drop out of the calculations which means this is no time for a rate rise as the economy slows. While the jump in inflation will damage the spending power of consumers, the September figures will prove a boost to pensioners as they are used to set the increase in pension payments for next year. Workers continue to be hit hard as real wages fall, because prices are rising faster than wages. Both the OBR and MPC have also been much too optimistic on wage growth wrongly expecting 4% with outcomes around 2% for the last six years. Consequently, high street sales also slumped in September, pushing the British retail sector to its lowest growth rate in four years. The economy continues to slow. Oh dear. Andrew Sentance Senior economic adviser at the PwC consultancy and member of the Bank\u2019s MPC from October 2006 to May 2011 The past month has seen a further surge in inflation, while the data on economic growth has been relatively subdued. The main drag on the UK economy at present is consumer spending, with retail sales volumes recording the slowest growth since 2013. However, anecdotal and survey evidence also supports the view that Brexit is holding back investment activity. With the world economy growing quite healthily, and our key export markets in Europe strengthening, we should expect UK business investment to be powering ahead. Instead, capital spending by UK businesses declined last year and has been pretty flat through the first half of this year. Both of these drags on the UK economy are Brexit-related, with the rise in inflation heavily driven by the decline in the value of the pound since the EU referendum. The weakness of domestic investment and consumer spending is preventing the UK benefiting from a general upswing in the global economy and an improvement in growth in the rest of the EU. As a result, there is a significant risk that the UK will find itself at the bottom of the G7 growth league in 2017, after being No1 or No2 in the previous four years \u2013 2013 to 2016. The most positive indicators continue to be found in the labour market, with employment continuing to rise and unemployment registering further falls. But there must be a question mark over how long the labour market will continue to be so resilient when economic growth remains relatively weak. The MPC is expected to push through an interest rate rise next month, despite subdued growth, and I believe the committee would be right to do so. A rate rise \u2013 and the promise of more to come \u2013 should help sterling and take some of the inflationary pressure off consumers. A gradual policy of edging interest rates up would also head off an unwanted surge in borrowing which is at risk of developing on the back of prolonged low interest rates. The MPC has already left it too long to start the process of gradually raising interest rates and should not put it off any longer.",

The weakness of domestic investment and consumer spending is preventing the UK benefiting from a general upswing in the global economy and an improvement in growth in the rest of the EU. As a result, there is a significant risk that the UK will find itself at the bottom of the G7 growth league in 2017, after being No1 or No2 in the previous four years \u2013 2013 to 2016.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/oct/24/the-brexit-economy-the-storm-clouds-are-gathering\">The Brexit economy: the storm clouds are gathering</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>The most positive indicators continue to be found in the labour market, with employment continuing to rise and unemployment registering further falls. But there must be a question mark over how long the labour market will continue to be so resilient when economic growth remains relatively weak.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/oct/17/uk-inflation-at-five-year-high-of-3-to-boost-state-pension\">The MPC is expected to push through an interest rate rise next month, despite subdued growth</a>, and I believe the committee would be right to do so. A rate rise \u2013 and the promise of more to come \u2013 should help sterling and take some of the inflationary pressure off consumers. A gradual policy of edging interest rates up would also head off an unwanted surge in borrowing which is at risk of developing on the back of prolonged low interest rates. The MPC has already left it too long to start the process of gradually raising interest rates and should not put it off any longer.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Pound falters despite rate hike talk Over the past month, sterling has faltered amid weak economic data and slow progress in the Brexit negotiations, despite expectations for an interest rate rise from the Bank of England, which should be pushing the currency higher. The pound has fallen back below the level it was at before the central bank suggested mid-September that the cost of borrowing may be increased in the \u201ccoming months\u201d. Sterling remains more than 10% down against the dollar since the EU referendum in June 2016. FTSE 100 rallies on weak sterling The pound\u2019s weakness is the FTSE 100\u2019s strength. That\u2019s because companies in the leading index of UK shares are typically global firms which make significant sums of money in foreign currencies, so a weak pound increases their bottom line and thus their stock prices. When sterling rises, the opposite happens. The FTSE 100 has risen more than 3% over the past month, hitting its record high on 12 October amid \u201cdeadlock\u201d in the Brexit talks, which had triggered a sell off in the pound. The FTSE 250 list, which has more companies rooted in the UK economy, has also risen about 3% over the past month. Inflation surge hurts consumers, yet may help pensioners The cost of living increased at its fastest annual rate since 2012 last month, as the consumer price index (CPI) edged up to 3% in September from 2.9% a month ago. Mark Carney, the governor of the Bank of England, said the sole reason behind the rate of inflation rising to this point was the depreciation of the pound after the vote to leave the EU. While the jump in inflation will damage the spending power of consumers, the September figures will prove a boon for pensioners as they are used to set the increase in pension payments for next year. While CPI at 3% was in line with City economists\u2019 forecasts, it is also expected to increase further over the coming months, which could push rate setters at the Bank to raise the cost of borrowing in November. Worse than forecast UK\u2019s trade in goods deficit hits record high Hopes that the weak pound since the referendum would increase exports, giving an economic uplift to offset a downturn in consumer spending, took yet another knock with the latest figures. The trade deficit in goods hit a record high, as the gap between what the UK bought and sold widened in August to \u00a314.2bn. That was much bigger than expected, and up from \u00a312.8bn in July. Imports surged by 4.2% during the month, while exports only rose by 0.7%. The overall trade deficit, including services, widened to \u00a35.6bn in August from \u00a34.2bn in July. Worse than forecast Key industries signal weak economic growth Key barometers of companies\u2019 sentiments about business activity pointed towards weak economic growth in September, with particularly bad news from the building and construction industry as it slipped into contraction. The UK\u2019s biggest sector, services, was the only area to record any improvement from August. The Markit/CIPS purchasing mangers\u2019 index (PMI) for the industry came in at 53.6 in September, beating analysts expectations and rising from 53.2 in August. The construction industry fell to 48.1 from August\u2019s reading of 51.1, its lowest level since July 2016 and below City estimates. Manufacturers reported higher prices for goods used in the production process, eroding the benefit from the weakness in the pound when selling abroad. The gauge of factory output came in at 55.9, below a forecast for 56.4 and down from a revised figure of 56.7 in August. The PMI measures, where anything above 50 indicates expansion, are tracked for early clues on official GDP figures. Better than forecast Deficit bolsters Hammond before budget Britain borrowed just \u00a35.9bn to balance the books last month, the smallest deficit for any September in the last 10 years. That beat City forecasts for the annual gap between government spending and tax receipts of \u00a36.5bn, and was down 11% on the same month a year ago. Higher than-expected tax receipts helped swell the coffers of the exchequer, handing Philip Hammond a fillip before next month\u2019s autumn budget despite recent Brexit turmoil and a sharp slowdown in GDP growth. Better than forecast Wages lag inflation despite low unemployment Company bosses blamed Brexit uncertainty as a factor behind sluggish growth in wages, as low levels of unemployment in the British economy failed to increase the bargaining power of workers to secure higher wages. Average pay excluding bonuses increased by 2.1% in the three months to August, down from 2.2% in the three months to July after a revision to the earlier figures, according to the latest figures from the Office for National Statistics. Although lacklustre, and the sixth-straight month of negative earnings, that beat City economists\u2019 forecasts for growth of 2%. The jobless rate remained steady at 4.3%, inline with estimates, although there were fewer people taking on work than in previous periods. Worse than forecast Consumer spending slows amid income squeeze High street sales slumped in September, pushing the British retail sector to its lowest growth rate in the three months to September since 2013. Month-on-month sales declined 0.8%, against expectations for a 0.1% fall, with supermarkets and food retailers, department stores and petrol stations hardest hit. Year-on-year sales volumes were up just 1.5% in the past three months, compared with about 4% annual growth between 2014 and 2016. The figures are a troubling indicator for the strength of the economy, with consumer spending a key component. Analysts linked weak sales with high inflation and falling real wages. Better than forecast House price growth remains subdued The latest monthly snapshot from the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (RICS) paints a picture of a subdued housing market in September. Sales and inquiries from potential purchasers both fell \u201cnoticeably\u201d, while there was little evidence that the market will pick up soon. London is bearing the brunt of falling prices, while there were also signs of cooling in the south east. A net balance of 6% of surveyors saw house prices increase rather than decrease, the same figure as recorded in August, although above City estimates for the gauge to fall to 4%. And another thing we\u2019ve learned this month ... weak productivity will hit the public finances Expectations for the productivity of UK workers will need to be \u201csignificantly\u201d lowered, according to the government\u2019s independent economic forecaster. The Office for Budget Responsibility said that, after a decade of stagnant growth since the financial crisis, the average rate of productivity growth of 0.2% over the past five years was a better guide for 2017 than its forecast of 1.6% in March. Treasury officials believe the downgrade will wipe out about two-thirds of the government\u2019s \u00a326bn budget surplus from 2017 to 2021, which had been seen as a war chest for a potential slowdown after a disorderly and harmful EU exit. Economists have had to repeatedly downgrade their forecasts for productivity growth as the official statistics have showed it stubbornly failing to improve.",

      "bodyText": "The Bank of England is seriously considering raising rates for the first time in 10 years against a backdrop of lacklustre economic growth, as a Guardian analysis shows the Brexit vote sapping business confidence and hitting household income. As Mark Carney, the Bank\u2019s governor, prepares to hike the cost of borrowing for the first time since 2007 from as soon as next week, key barometers of economic strength are faltering. Nevertheless, City analysts expect Carney and his panel of rate setters on the monetary policy committee to vote for a rate hike on 2 November. Threadneedle Street is thought to have backed itself into a corner \u2013 with financial markets reckoning there is an 80% chance of a hike \u2013 after the MPC said at its last meeting in September it could move to increase rates within the \u201ccoming months\u201d. Stepping back from the brink may now cause the pound to fall and would undermine the central bank\u2019s credibility, having been called an \u201cunreliable boyfriend\u201d once before for failing to act on its hints. As the Bank considers reversing last year\u2019s emergency rate cut to 0.25% from 0.5% to avert a Brexit-induced recession, the Guardian\u2019s tracker of economic news is now painting a picture of tougher times for consumers. Against this backdrop, Carney has been warned of the risks for raising interest rates. Writing in the Guardian, David Blanchflower, a former member of the Bank\u2019s rate-setting monetary policy committee, said: \u201cThis is no time for a rate rise as the economy slows.\u201d To gauge the impact of the Brexit vote on a monthly basis, the Guardian has chosen eight economic indicators, along with the value of the pound and the performance of the FTSE 100. Economists make forecasts for seven of those barometers ahead of their release, and in four cases the outcome was worse than expected. Households are reining in spending amid a protracted squeeze on living standards from rising inflation, coming as a result of higher import costs due to the drop in the pound since the referendum. High street sales slumped last month, pushing the UK retail sector to its lowest growth rate in four years for the three months to the end of September. Inflation reached a five-and-a-half-year high in September, edging up to 3% from 2.9% in August, with food prices and transport costs driving the increase. The MPC has said it expects inflation to peak above 3% in October, which would force Carney to write a letter to the chancellor to explain his failure to target inflation at 2%. Under questioning from MPs on the Treasury select committee, the governor said it was \u201cmore likely than not\u201d he would be writing to Philip Hammond and that the effect of the weak pound \u2013 still more than 10% down on the dollar since the referendum \u2013 would still be felt three years after the vote. Lingering high inflation could provide the ammunition for the Bank to target a rate hike, as raising the cost of borrowing pushes down demand for products and therefore lowering prices. Threadneedle Street may also want to use higher rates to curb the rapid growth of personal loans, credit cards and car finance. Another former MPC member, Andrew Sentance, backed a rate rise for this reason despite the subdued growth signals. Writing in the Guardian, he said: \u201cA rate rise \u2013 and the promise of more to come \u2013 should help sterling and take some of the inflationary pressure off consumers. \u201cA gradual policy of edging interest rates up would also head off an unwanted surge in borrowing which is at risk of developing on the back of prolonged low interest rates. The MPC has already left it too long to start the process of gradually raising interest rates and should not put it off any longer.\u201d The latest dashboard shows some bright spots, with unemployment remaining at its lowest level since the mid-1970s and the FTSE 100 hitting a record high. Britain also recorded the smallest gap between public spending and tax receipts for the month of September in the past 10 years, helping the chancellor as he prepares for his budget next month. However, there are warnings that a rate hike might be premature, as the higher cost of borrowing could further dent the spending power of consumers and businesses. \u201cMagnified by Brexit risks, we see danger in prematurity,\u201d said John Wraith of the Swiss bank UBS. The lowest level of unemployment since 1975 is still failing to boost the bargaining power of workers in the UK, as figures for the last month showed negative real wage growth. Threadneedle Street has been looking for signs of rising earnings because it would show households might be able to withstand higher borrowing costs. Company bosses blamed Brexit uncertainty and the higher cost of goods used due to inflation \u2013 making it difficult for them to offer better pay packages. Firms have been avoiding investment due to fears over the lack of progress in talks between ministers and Brussels. Businesses could be further discouraged after Theresa May said there would be no transitional deal to leave the EU until the UK\u2019s future trading relationship is settled. Firms had been pushing David Davis, the Brexit secretary, to quickly sign such an arrangement or risk losing jobs and investment. The Guardian\u2019s Brexit dashboard shows the key barometers of sentiment among companies about business activity were negative in September, barring a modest rise in activity in the services sector, the UK\u2019s biggest industry. Britain\u2019s construction industry showed signs of contracting for the first time since the immediate aftermath of the referendum, as work started before the vote comes to an end and isn\u2019t replaced by enough new commissions amid political uncertainty. Manufacturers also reported higher prices for goods used in the production process, eroding the benefit from the weakness in the pound when selling abroad. Some companies have warned of skills shortages exacerbating their costs, amid early signs that some EU migrants are starting to leave the UK. Less spending by firms point to a potential growth slowdown, according to Sentance, who said it could push the UK from the top two places in the G7 growth league between 2013 and 2016 \u2013 to the bottom for this year. Britain\u2019s sluggish growth \u2013 which is expected to be confirmed in official GDP figures on Wednesday \u2013 also comes as other economies roar ahead. \u201cThe weakness of domestic investment and consumer spending is preventing the UK benefiting from a general upswing in the global economy and an improvement in growth in the rest of the EU,\u201d Sentance said. The storm clouds for the economy are also gathering as Philip Hammond prepares to deliver his budget next month. Alongside the weak economic data, the chancellor was also dealt a blow from the government\u2019s independent economic forecaster, which said it would need to \u201csignificantly\u201d lower its expectations for the productivity of British workers. The Office for Budget Responsibility said the average rate of productivity growth of 0.2% over the past five years was a better guide for 2017 than its forecast of 1.6% in March. Treasury officials believe the downgrade will wipe out about two-thirds of the government\u2019s \u00a326bn budget surplus from 2017 to 2021, which had been seen as a stockpile for a potential slowdown and disorderly EU exit. Businesses are calling on the chancellor to spur the economy through spending on infrastructure, offsetting the uncertainty of leaving the EU by boosting activity at home. Blanchflower said austerity was a major factor behind the weaker than hoped for growth in productivity. \u201cOutput per man hour today is essentially unchanged ever since the austerity was imposed by the coalition,\u201d he said. \u201cAs a consequence, the public finances are in much worse shape than the chancellor has claimed, given there is likely much less growth,\u201d he added. \u2022 This article was amended on 25 October 2017 to correct a quote made by Blanchflower.",

      "bodyText": "The number of manufacturing firms citing a shortage of workers for limiting their investment plans is at its highest for four years, according to a survey by the CBI. The employers\u2019 body also found that growth in factory orders had slowed in October to its lowest level in nearly 12 months and that optimism about business conditions had fallen for the first time in a year. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen a general softening in manufacturing activity over the past three months, with the outlook for investment becoming more subdued,\u201d said Rain Newton-Smith, the CBI\u2019s chief economist. \u201cTo boost investment growth, government should use the budget to provide a fillip for factories through business rate reforms, including exempting new plant and machinery from rates altogether.\u201d Newton-Smith also called for a change to setting rates based on the consumer price index (CPI) measure of inflation, rather than the retail prices index (RPI), which is typically higher. Even so, she said, growth in orders and output was above historic norms in the survey of almost 400 UK manufacturers. It showed that firms were working at their closest to full capacity for nearly 20 years. Concern over skills shortages was at its highest level in four years, the CBI said, and firms were expecting to cut back planned capital expenditure on tangible goods. The CBI was among the five UK business lobby groups warning the Brexit secretary, David Davis, that time is running out for the government to strike a transition deal before firms start to rein in spending plans as they finalise budgets for 2018. Its latest quarterly industrial trends survey was published just hours after a survey by the EEF trade body found that manufacturers were reining in investment as uncertainty over Brexit made them more reluctant to spend money on new factories and machinery. The EEF called on the chancellor, Philip Hammond, to use his budget on 22 November to introduce measures that would encourage business investment, a view echoed by the CBI. Andrew Wishart, a UK economist at consultancy Capital Economics, said the main factor putting firms off investing was uncertainty over future demand. \u201cDespite robust demand leading to the proportion of firms working at full capacity increasing to its highest level since 1998, business optimism and investment intentions fell,\u201d said Wishart. \u201cHowever, other parts of the survey cast doubt on whether firms needed to increase investment. Only 14% of respondents said that they had less than adequate capacity, with 8% saying plant capacity in particular was the main factor restricting output.\u201d The Bank of England\u2019s monetary policy committee will decide next month whether to increase interest rates from their historic low of 0.25%. Data due to be published this week is expected to show that UK growth stalled at 0.3% in the third quarter of the year. The slump in the value of sterling since the vote for Brexit in June 2016 is regarded as helpful for manufacturers reliant on export markets, as the fall in the currency against the euro and the dollar makes it relatively cheaper to sell abroad.",

      "bodyText": "The latest release of data from the 2016 census reveals the ageing population has seen a shift in the makeup of our workforce with more people employed as community and personal service workers than ever before. The census data also confirms previous data suggesting that the cutting of interest rates has made servicing a mortgage easier over the past five year. But while the shift in work has seen an increase in carers and domestic cleaners, the census also reveals that women continue to the do bulk of the housework. It will probably not come as a shock to anyone that the electorate with the highest median mortgage is that held by our prime minister. The latest batch of census data released yesterday revealed than in 2016, the median monthly mortgage in the seat of Wentworth was $3,000 \u2013 some $30 a month higher than the second most expensive electorate to have a mortgage \u2013 that of Warringah, held by the previous prime minister Tony Abbott. The census data however reveals that while Warringah comes in second for highest mortgage payments, it comes in first on incomes, with the highest median household income in the land of $2,384 a week (or $123,968 a year). But don\u2019t feel too bad for the good voters of Wentworth \u2013 they come in second on the household income scale with a median weekly income of $2,380. Both Sydney suburbs sit a long way above the poorest electorate by income \u2013 that of Hinkler in Queensland, which has a median household income of $946. But on this score, the figures can be misleading. Hinkler is not so much poor as it is old. The median age of Hinkler is 46, compared to the national median of 38. Similarly, the second poorest electorate by income is the mid NSW costal electorate of Lyne \u2013 it is even older, with a median age of 50. So when comparing incomes there always needs to be a bit of care. Only three non-Sydney electorates are in the top 15 most expensive \u2013 Julie Bishop\u2019s seat of Curtin in Perth, Tim Wilson\u2019s seat of Goldstein in Melbourne and Josh Frydenberg\u2019s seat of Kooyong also in Melbourne. But an expensive mortgage does not necessarily mean high levels of mortgage stress \u2013 because generally a high median mortgage also means you live in an area with high median household incomes. Where it becomes tough is those areas where the mortgage prices are high, but the median income is not so. And for that, a good place to look is western Sydney. While in Wentworth the median monthly mortgage is equivalent to 31.5% of the median income, in the seat of Blaxland, the median mortgage payments take up 39.9% of the median household income \u2013 making it the toughest electorate in the nation to pay off a mortgage. When we exclude the electorates with high numbers of pensioners, we see western Sydney seats such Watson, Fowler and McMahon where the median mortgage payments are well above the national average of 30.5% of median household income. To find the place where it is easiest to service a mortgage you need to look to the national capital. The seats of Canberra and Fenner have the lowest ratio of median mortgage to median income. In the seat of Canberra, the median mortgage payment is worth just 24.7% of the median household income and in the northern Canberra seat of Fenner, it is just 25.2% \u2013 a consequence of both seats being in the top 35 for size of mortgages, but in the top 15 for size of household income: Map: mortgage payments as a percentage of household income Overall however the data shows that the size of mortgages payments relative to household income has fallen in the past years in all states, and in NSW, Victoria and Queensland it is even lower than it was in 2006: Given when the 2011 census was held the standard variable mortgage rate was 7.8%, and when it was held last year it was down to 5.25%, it is not a surprise that mortgages are easier to service \u2013 but such figures say nothing about the affordability of purchasing a home. The census data also reveals the impact of the ageing population. In the past 10 years, the biggest jump in the share of the population has come among those aged 65-74 years \u2013 going from 6.9% in 2006 to 8.9% in 2016: The increase in the share of retirees has also seen a shift in the type of work being done \u2013 with the healthcare and social assistance industry seeing an increase of 183,382 jobs in the five years from 2011 to 2016 \u2013 nearly 30% of all new employed: This flows through into the growth of occupations. Easily the fastest growing occupation is community and personal service workers: This includes jobs such as child care and aged care, which the ABS has found were among the three occupations with the biggest increase in workers. The ABS also notes that from 2006 to 2016 there was a 130% increase in people working as domestic cleaners. This will no doubt be a relief to many women given the census data reveals that yet again it is women who do most of the unpaid domestic work. Nearly 27% of all women do more than 15 hours of unpaid domestic work compared to just 8% of men: Now of course this would not be too surprising given more men work full-time than do women. But the census data helpfully gives us the breakdown of hours of unpaid domestic work done by people according to how many hours of paid work they also do. This allows us to compare men and women in like for like work situations. And men come out badly. Of the 1.7m women who work 35-40 hours a week, 19% also do more than 15 hours of unpaid domestic work, compared to just 8% of the 2.3m men. Rather embarrassingly for men nearly a quarter of them who work such hours do no domestic work at all compared to just 14% of the women: As for the domestic cleaners? They are one of the just 69 occupations out of 476 where women account for more than three quarters of those employed. Whether being paid or not, if someone is doing the cleaning around home, the good bet is it is being done by a woman.",
