      "bodyText": "Tommy Suharto, the son of Indonesia's late president, has contacted the Serious Fraud Office in London to deny allegations that he was bribed by Rolls-Royce to persuade an Indonesian airline to buy the UK company's engines. Lawyers for Suharto have written to the SFO's director David Green stating that he was never given $20m (\u00a312.4m) and a Rolls-Royce car to encourage the Garuda airline to buy Trent 700 engines in 1990. Suharto's lawyers, the Indonesian firm Elza Syarief, said in a statement that the letter \"stated categorically that he [Suharto] did not, and has never, received monies or a car from Rolls-Royce and nor did he recommend their engines to Garuda, as alleged\". The firm added: \"The SFO has not contacted Rolls-Royce, Garuda or Mr Suharto and there is no legal case or investigation, pending or otherwise, in relation to these false allegations.\" A London-based spokesman for Elza Syarief said the purpose of the letter, which was sent last week, was to set the record straight and to quash misconceptions about Suharto. Last year, the SFO ordered Rolls-Royce to hand over details of possible bribery and corruption in China, Indonesia and other overseas markets and to conduct an internal inquiry into the claims. Dick Taylor, a former Rolls-Royce employee in Indonesia, alleged via a series of online postings that Suharto, the youngest son of the former Indonesian president who died in 2008, was bribed by Rolls-Royce. Taylor has said he felt \"cheated\" by his experience at Rolls-Royce, the world's second largest aircraft engine maker, based in Derbyshire. He said he was warned that he risked losing his job when he raised concerns over a colleague's expenses claims. Taylor subsequently took early retirement in 2004 but claims that Rolls-Royce was still making payments to intermediaries in Indonesia in 2010. Rolls-Royce then faced further allegations that it paid bribes to an executive involved with two Chinese airlines. The later allegations were made in postings by a blogger operating under the pseudonym of \"soaringdragon\" and related to deals worth a total of $2bn with Air China in 2005 and China Eastern in 2010. Rolls-Royce said its own investigation through law firm, Debevoise &amp; Plimpton, found \"matters of concern\" in Indonesia and China and other unspecified markets over \"concerns about bribery and corruption involving intermediaries in overseas markets\". The Asia-Pacific region is a vital market for western aerospace companies targeting new customers as demand stagnates at home. According to Airbus, the region will account for 35% of aircraft deliveries over the next 20 years, with China overtaking the US as the world's largest domestic airline market from 2031 onwards. As well as bringing opportunities for aircraft makers such as Airbus and Boeing, new jet sales also boost orders for engines. The frontrunners for those orders are Rolls-Royce and its US rivals, General Electric and Pratt &amp; Whitney. Rolls-Royce and the SFO could not be reached for comment.",

      "bodyText": "Royal Bank of Scotland has appointed the law firm Clifford Chance to examine damaging allegations that the bailed-out bank is deliberately wrecking viable small businesses to make a profit. The move came as Sir Andrew Large said in a report commissioned by the bank that RBS had left itself open to accusations of conflict of interest by small firms placed in its restructuring division because of its opaque management structure. Large made clear that he had not investigated the allegations, made by an adviser to the business secretary, Vince Cable, but had advised RBS to commission an investigation that will be carried out by Clifford Chance. Large published his report shortly after Cable handed regulators a dossier containing the allegations. Large, a former deputy governor of the Bank of England, urged other banks to review their treatment of small business customers in light of the dossier compiled by Leeds-based businessman Lawrence Tomlinson, entrepreneur in residence at the department for business, innovation and skills. Tomlinson is accusing RBS of forcing viable businesses into its Global Restructuring Group (GRG) which sells on properties to its West Register division. Referring to the unproven allegations, the Large report said: \"Internal structures at RBS are not well suited to mitigating the risk of poor perceptions arising for the whole bank as a result of the experiences of distressed customers.\" The GRG operation, run by the veteran banker Derek Sach, operates as a profit centre.

      "bodyText": "Former Pizza Express chairman Luke Johnson has made his second foray into the travel industry in three months with the acquisition of Neilson Active Holidays. Johnson's Risk Capital Partners investment vehicle has paid \u00a39.15m to buy Neilson, which offers sailing, skiing and beach trips to 90,000 holidaymakers a year, from tour operator Thomas Cook. Johnson said he expected a boom in active holidays, alongside a post-crunch recovery in skiing trips, as expensive vacations regain their popularity. Established in 1978, Neilson generated revenues of \u00a370m last year. It operates nine BeachClubs in Greece and Turkey, offering activities such as windsurfing, water skiing and tennis, as well as ski chalets in European resorts and also owns and operates 119 cruising yachts.

    "webTitle": "Mortgage lending hits nearly \u00a310bn in October", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Britain's housing boom continued in October following a jump in new mortgage lending, but a sharp contraction in business lending appeared to underline the weakness of the recovery. According to industry figures, new mortgage lending was 32% higher than the same period last year, rising to \u00a39.9bn as borrowers joined the rush to buy a home. The British Bankers' Association (BBA) said the government-funded Help to Buy scheme and the Bank of England's funding for lending scheme (FLS), which has driven down mortgage costs, were helping first-time buyers get on the property ladder. BBA's statistics director, David Dooks, said: \"The housing market continues to pick up. October's new mortgage borrowing was 32% higher than in October last year and approvals for house purchase were 33% higher. Improving consumer confidence is also leading to the banks seeing higher demand for personal loans.\" Unsecured borrowing also rose over the last year as a growth in card borrowing outstripped a fall in the use of overdrafts and personal loans. But the number of mortgage approvals fell from 75,077 in September to 74,743 in October. Analysts said the decline was a signal that higher prices were deterring some prospective buyers, while forcing borrowers still in the market to take out larger loans. The average house purchase loan rose from \u00a3151,700 in September to \u00a3156,400 in October, according to the BBA figures. Help to Buy, which provides a deposit of up to 20% of a property's value, has supported a recent homebuying surge but credit limits set by banks and a lack of wage rises since 2009 are expected to blunt its impact over the coming year. Overall borrowing came down as established borrowers continued to repay their loans at a faster pace than new buyers can take them out. So, despite the \u00a39.9bn of gross new mortgage lending, the net figure declined by \u00a330.2bn on a year ago to leave \u00a3780bn of mortgage debt still left to repay on housing assets estimated to be worth \u00a34tn. Worryingly for the Treasury, business lending declined in all major sectors except manufacturing, which still contracted on a year ago, though at a much slower pace. Apart from a brief boom in borrowing by property firms in 2011, business lending in each major sector has contracted on an annualised basis in every year since the financial crash. On a month-on-month basis, the figures also disappointed after signs of a revival in September. Howard Archer, chief economist at IHS Global Insight, said a fall in net lending to non-financial companies by \u00a3940m in October, having seen a month-on-month rise of \u00a32.5bn in September, was \"very disappointing\". The September figure marked the largest lift since January 2009 and only the third rise in the past 11 months. \"It remains to be seen if October's relapse in lending was at least partly a correction after the jump in lending in September but it is nevertheless a setback to hopes that banks are becoming more prepared to lend to businesses given the improved economic situation and outlook,\" he said. \"It also raises questions as to whether the extension to the funding for lending scheme (in April to favour lending to smaller and medium-sized businesses is having much impact.\" The Bank of England cut the cost of borrowing last year when it launched the FLS. Banks, which could access cheap funds from the central bank, passed them on to mortgage borrowers, but were more reluctant to provide commercial loans. In April the incentive to make business loans was increased, but banks complained their business clients had little appetite for lending. Archer said there were signs that businesses wanted to increase their borrowing to invest as the economic recovery broadened. He said: \"While low bank lending to businesses earlier this year was clearly at least partly due to low demand for credit from companies, there are signs that firms' desire to borrow is now picking up. \"There was clearly low demand for credit in the early months of this year, with many companies still very wary about borrowing and investing in a prolonged difficult economic environment. \"However, there is evidence that firms are now looking to step up their borrowing as markedly improved economic activity in recent months lifts their confidence and need for capital.\"",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The big six energy firms have been exposed to further accusations of profiteering after the industry regulator revealed that profits per customer last year rose by 77%. On the eve of a protest by anti-poverty campaigners against power suppliers, Ofgem said the profit per household had risen from \u00a330 in 2011 to \u00a353, driven by higher prices and increased demand for heating during last year's winter snap. The average profit margin for supplying energy to households in 2012 was 4.3%, up from 2.8% in 2011, with total profits from supplying energy to households and businesses rising from \u00a31.25bn to \u00a31.6bn last year. \"Any profit margin at a time when people are dying because they cannot afford to turn their heating on is unacceptable,\" said Clare Welton at the Fuel Poverty Action group, which will mark the publication of the latest winter mortality figures on Tuesday with a protest at RWE npower's headquarters in central London. Protests will also be held at the new British Gas headquarters in Oxford. Alex Smith, a spokesperson for UK Uncut, a co-organiser of the protests, described the latest data as unsurprising. \"We have seen nothing but profiteering from the big six,\" he said. The big six \u2013 British Gas, npower, SSE, Scottish Power, E.ON and EDF \u2013 argue that their industry is misunderstood and higher bills are the inevitable consequence of external factors such as green levies passed on by the government, higher wholesale prices and increased power transmission costs. However, the industry's trade body admitted this month that the big six had become a \"lightning conductor for the general concern about the cost of living.\" As a result, the companies have faced cross-party condemnation for average increases to consumer bills well above inflation. Labour leader Ed Miliband has pledged a price freeze, while former prime minister Sir John Major has called for a windfall tax on profits. The Ofgem data does not cover profits related to the latest series of price rises, which has reignited the debate about whether the big six make \"fair\" profits. Ofgem said rising prices, rather than lower costs, were a factor in the profit increase. \"There is some evidence of rising profit margins. This rise has been due to a combination of higher prices and volumes rather than lower costs,\" said the regulator. But Richard Hall, director of infrastructure at Consumer Futures, a consumer watchdog, said Ofgem had \"produced a lot of evidence that would persuade a third party that there is a trend [of rising prices]\". He pointed out that other Ofgem data showed \"a steady escalation in profit\". The regulator's own forecast data shows an average profit per customer of \u00a3105 in November 2013. Caroline Flint, Labour's spokesperson for energy and climate change, said the Ofgem report showed why a price freeze is needed: \"Labour's price freeze will save money for 27 million households and 2.4 million businesses and our plans to reset the market will deliver fairer prices in the future. People are sick and tired of paying over the odds because David Cameron is too weak to stand up to the energy companies and just stands up for a privileged few.\" A spokesperson at the Department for Energy and Climate Change said: \"Profits are a matter for energy companies to justify to their customers and shareholders, but profits are needed if they are to continue to invest in Britain's energy security and infrastructure.\" Although energy companies have been making more money from supplying households, overall profits were down 3.4% in 2012 on the previous year, from \u00a33.7bn to \u00a33.9bn, as firms were hit by depreciation costs and declining profitability from their gas-fired power stations. Consumer groups are calling on Ofgem to compel energy companies to publish financial information closer to real time. The regulator has been criticised by MPs for dismissing recommendations from its own consultants to make the energy market work more transparently. Ofgem had \"room for significant improvement\" said Hall. \"It feels as though we are only now starting to see the implementation or possible implementation of changes that we could have been done a couple of years ago.\"",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "A note slipped to Margaret Thatcher during a reception at No 10 Downing Street led to Sir Robin Leigh-Pemberton, later Lord Kingsdown, being appointed governor of the Bank of England in 1983. Leigh-Pemberton, who has died aged 86, held the post for two five-year terms. He had never appeared to seek the governorship, but to Thatcher he seemed the ideal candidate. Her phrase \"one of us\" fitted: he was the right sort, a loyal Conservative who spent years as leader of Kent county council. He was also, conveniently, a banker, being chairman of National Westminster. However, before his second term was over, far from being \"Thatcher's poodle\" as critics of his appointment had feared, he proved determined to take his own line on European monetary union and Thatcher refused even to speak to him. They had met when he was chair of the Committee of London Clearing Bankers. At a reception to discuss what more the City could do for industry, he surreptitiously handed her the briefing note he had been given for the occasion by one of the committee's economists. She slipped it into her handbag and, on the strength of it, decided that Leigh-Pemberton \u2013 unlike most others she had met from the City \u2013 was somebody with whom she could do business. The City disagreed. He was not the right sort of banker. His name had not been included on the list of candidates prepared for her, because he was not from one of the 16 accepting houses which ran the money markets. In fact, they muttered, he was not really a banker at all, but a country landowner and barrister who had found himself elevated, in 1977, to the NatWest chair. His experience of international banking was virtually non-existent. So alarmed were the insiders at the Bank that, before he arrived, they set up a committee which, in effect, would take the important executive decisions. Each Friday morning the committee would meet under the chairmanship of deputy governor Kit McMahon to decide how the Bank's business was conducted. Leigh-Pemberton, however, was no fool. While he was content to delegate certain technical elements of the Bank's administration to the committee, and acted more as chairman of the board than as chief executive, he saw that power had to be clawed back. Perhaps because of his background \u2013 Eton, Oxford, the Grenadier Guards and the law \u2013 and his languid way of speaking, which exaggerated the sense that Leigh-Pemberton was just a member of the landed gentry and not especially bright, the technocrats underestimated Leigh-Pemberton. While he was most definitely a country gentleman with a 2,200-acre agricultural estate in Kent, he was quick to pick up the essentials of any situation \u2013 and he was decisive in what should be done about it. He was not to be sidelined. His first step was to demand to see the minutes of the committee's meetings. Next, he insisted on seeing the agenda before the meetings. Thus armed, he made sure the deputy governors were aware of his position on the issues which concerned him. In that way, he succeeded in pulling back power without the need for confrontations. He was, however, essentially a delegator, albeit an informed one who sensed when it was necessary to take control of a situation. Meanwhile, he continued to spend some time each week on his other job as lord lieutenant of Kent. His private office needed to know when to lay out his sword and fancy uniform. An additional pennant was fitted to the official Rolls-Royce to fly his flag. On weekdays, he lived in the governor's flat at the New Change office building overlooking St Paul's Cathedral; he installed beehives on the building's roof. He effortlessly entertained the great and good, including the Queen, and travelled the world, getting to know other central bankers. They liked to visit each other's country estates \u2013 the clubbable newcomer fitted in well. He joined Jacques Delors's committee to design the template for economic and monetary union. In 1984 the governor was faced with the collapse of Johnson Matthey Bankers, which had made huge loans to customers who turned out to be not creditworthy. He flew back from America to take control of negotiations throughout a Sunday night. Before the markets opened on Monday, the bank announced it had bought JMB for \u00a31 and would meet its liabilities. His decisiveness caused a huge problem with the chancellor of the exchequer, Nigel Lawson, who had assured the House of Commons that \"no public money\" had gone into the rescue. When it emerged that the Bank had provided \u00a3100m to keep JMB afloat, Lawson felt he had been misled. Neither the house nor the public at large shared the Bank's fine distinction between capital and liquidity, nor between the Bank's own capital and public money. There was also considerable criticism of the Bank's regulatory competence. Events were moving quickly in Europe, particularly after Delors took over as president of the European commission in 1985. Leigh-Pemberton argued that sterling should join the European exchange rate mechanism, as did Lawson, but failed to convince Thatcher. In the end, Britain joined the ERM in 1990 only to be forced out two years later despite the Bank's selling of huge amounts of reserves to try to maintain the rate. In 1985, the City was also gearing up for deregulation of the securities industry, with the deadline for \"Big Bang\" set for October 1986. Despite a couple of early technical blips, deregulation went smoothly enough, but within a year the market crashed. The government was in the throes of selling off a large tranche of BP shares. The sale price had been fixed but the market price of BP slumped. Leigh-Pemberton was again overseas, and Sir Hector Laing's private jet was sent to collect him. Lawson wanted the City underwriters to shoulder the losses they had agreed to risk on the world's largest ever share sale. Leigh-Pemberton sided with the City and tried to persuade him to cancel the sale. Lawson felt totally let down. The other major crisis that Leigh-Pemberton had to face was the closure in 1991 of the Bank of Credit and Commerce International. Again there was criticism of the Bank's supervisory regime, not helped when Leigh- Pemberton told a Commons committee that in the City, BCCI had been known as the \"Bank of Crooks and Cocaine International\". Not every crisis involved high finance. On one occasion, he was abroad when telephoned by a frantic Bank official to be told his bees had swarmed and invaded the offices below. When asked for advice he said \"Put them in a box\" and rang off. Eventually, when the office roof was needed to accommodate air-conditioning equipment, he took the hives home in the back of his car. Throughout the highs and lows of his two terms, he was a cheerful, approachable and well-liked figure. He invited staff down to the family estate of Torry Hill, which includes a cricket field \u2013 he played for the Bank's team \u2013 and a narrow gauge steam railway, complete with viaduct and tunnel, on which Leigh-Pemberton, wearing an engine driver's cap, would take his visitors for rides. After retiring in 1993 he was created a life peer as Lord Kingsdown and joined several boards and committees, with directorships of Redland, Glaxo Holdings and Hambros. In 1953 he married Rosemary Forbes, daughter of the Dowager Marchioness of Exeter. Rosemary survives him, as do four of their five sons. \u2022 Robin (Robert) Leigh-Pemberton, Baron Kingsdown, banker, born 5 January 1927; died 25 November 2013",

On one occasion, he was abroad when telephoned by a frantic Bank official to be told his bees had swarmed and invaded the offices below. When asked for advice he said \"Put them in a box\" and rang off. Eventually, when the office roof was needed to accommodate air-conditioning equipment, he took the hives home in the back of his car.</p> <p>Throughout the highs and lows of his two terms, he was a cheerful, approachable and well-liked figure. He invited staff down to the family estate of Torry Hill, which includes a cricket field \u2013 he played for the Bank's team \u2013 and a narrow gauge steam railway, complete with viaduct and tunnel, on which Leigh-Pemberton, wearing an engine driver's cap, would take his visitors for rides.</p> <p>After retiring in 1993 he was created a life peer as Lord Kingsdown and joined several boards and committees, with directorships of Redland, Glaxo Holdings and Hambros.</p> <p>In 1953 he married Rosemary Forbes, daughter of the Dowager Marchioness of Exeter. Rosemary survives him, as do four of their five sons.</p> <p>\u2022 Robin (Robert) Leigh-Pemberton, Baron Kingsdown, banker, born 5 January 1927; died 25 November 2013</p>",

      "bodyText": "Wall Street remains calm, with the Nasdaq composite index hovering just below the 4,000 mark which it hit for the first time since 2000 earlier today. So I'm going to wrap up for the night. Back tomorrow. Thanks and goodnight, GW. Some of the early market optimism over the historic, but interim Iranian nuclear deal with Iran is ebbing away tonight. The Brent crude price is back at $110 per barrel, as traders eye the long road towards a comprehensive, permanent deal. US crude remains $1 per barrel lower, though, at $93.95. Capital Economic's Tom Pugh reckons that this permanent deal would unlock at least one million extra barrels of crude oil per day from Iran (the current sanctions have forced Tehran to close down production sites because it can't sell, or even insure, the oil). Pugh reckons a comprehensive settlement with Iran, boosting production and reducing geopolitical risk, would help to bring the oil price down to $70 per barrel by the end of the decade. He writes: There is unlikely to be an immediate increase in oil supplies since the bulk of the sanctions in Iran are still in place and none of the relief outlined over the weekend will allow Iran to increase oil exports materially. But it bodes well for a much more comprehensive agreement to be struck next year. We expect this to contribute to a fall in oil prices to $90 per barrel (pb) by the end of 2014 and further to $70 per barrel by the end of 2020. European stock markets have closed for the day, with yet another record high on the German Dax. Here's the closing prices: FTSE 100: up 20 points at 6694, +0.3% German DAX: up 80 points at 9299, +0.88% French CAC: up 23 points at 4301, +0.55% Spanish IBEX: up 11 points at 9689, + 0.1% Italian FTSE MIB: down 38 points at 18784, -0.2% Travel firms rallied across Europe, while oil and precious metal firms fell broadly: CMC's Michael Hewson sums it up: The prospect of lower oil prices is always going to be received in a positive fashion given the positive effects they have on the cost base of not only businesses, but also consumers, who will inevitably find that they have more money available for other discretionary spending. . Whoever said deflation was a bad thing, certainly not equity investors who propelled the DAX to yet another record high above 9,300. The key beneficiary of this weekend\u2019s news has not unexpectedly been travel stocks with Air France-KLM higher in Paris and Easyjet and InternationalConsolidated Airlines in London amongst the gainers as well as turnaround story of the year Thomas Cook whose shares have risen over 700% in the last 12 months, and who are expected to show a return to profit when they report their latest numbers on Thursday this week. Unsurprisingly oil and gas stocks have slid back as some of the inherent risk premium in Brent fades into the background, while other commodity stocks have also slumped with gold hitting its lowest levels since July as the safe haven qualities continue to lose their appeal. Randgold Resources and Vedanta Resources are the biggest fallers in this sector while a broker downgrade has torpedoed defence contractor Babcock who help maintain the UK\u2019s nuclear submarine fleet, after the firm announced it was in discussions with Avincis, an aviation services group. Over in Greece senior government officials have been meeting to draw up a strategy for the demands the debt-stricken country now faces from its \u201ctroika\u201d of creditors. Helena Smith, our correspondent, Athens, says foreign lenders want to see concrete steps before they return to Greece. She writes: Emerging from the prime minister\u2019s office where the meeting was held the country\u2019s technocrat finance minister Yannis Stournaras said it wasn't a question of \u201cif\u201d but \u201cwhen\u201d Greece\u2019s differences with its creditors were finally resolved. \u201cEverything has to be solved before Greece assumes the [EU] helm,\u201d he said referring to the rotating presidency of the 27-nation bloc which Greece takes over in January. \u201cIt must be resolved. It has to be resolved,\u201d he told reporters gathered outside the building. The IMF\u2019s mission chief to Greece, Poul Thomsen, rejected the idea that Athens would need to adopt more across-the-board cuts in the form of wage and pension reductions in an interview at the weekend. But, he insisted that Greece would \u201chave to enforce new measures during the period 2014-16 ... targeted measures so as not to hurt vulnerable population groups.\u201d The IMF, ECB and EU have said openly that the price of further rescue funds will be painful structural reforms \u2013 hinting darkly that if prime minister Antonsi Samaras' fragile coalition does not enforce the measures, visiting inspectors who hold the key to further aid may not return to continue stalled talks next week. Greece faces challenges on five fronts: dismissing 4,000 civil servants by the end of the year; ending the blanket ban on home foreclosures for those who owe in excess of 200,000 euro to the bank; closing down the country\u2019s loss-making defence industry; improving tax collection; and finally agreeing on ways to close the fiscal gap next year. Helena also flags up that support for the far-right Golden Dawn, three of whose MPs were in court today, is rising again: In the depths of another winter the prospect of yet more austerity is having a numbing effect with the neo-fascist Golden Dawn party appearing to be the big winner. After support for the extremists dropped precipitously following the fatal September stabbing of Pavlos Fyssas, an anti-fascist rapper, the party is on the rebound with Metron Analysis recording its popularity jumping from 7.6% to 10% in its monthly survey released this Sunday. \u201cThe neo-Nazi organization is once again in full force before Pavlos Fyssas\u2019 blood has even dried,\u201d wrote Sunday\u2019s Ethnos newspaper which commissioned the poll. The group\u2019s dramatic ascent follows the cold-blooded murders of two Golden Dawn members outside a local party branch in Athens on November 1. Golden Dawn is the only party to see its support soar with all agreeing that austerity is one of the major culprits. On the drop in the oil price, Saxo Bank's head of commodity strategy, Ole Hansen,writes: It comes primarily as a relief sell-off as extra oil is not going to be flowing anytime soon. The agreement will loosen some of the economic sanctions that have been imposed over the past year and should bring an immediate relief to the Iranian economy, which has been reeling. The latest housing data from America suggests that the debt ceiling deadlock of October has hurt the US economy. Pending home sales fell by 0.6% last month, rather worse than the 1%+ rise which economists were expecting. The shutdown on Capitol Hill is being blamed, for making Americans more cautious about signing on the bottom line for a new home. There's also an argument that the uncertainty over the Federal Reserve's asset-purchasing scheme hit the housing market (because 'tapering' the Fed's bond-buying could push up borrowing costs down the line): The process of easing sanctions against Iran will begin in the new year, following Tehran's agreement to halt and reverse its nuclear programme: My colleagues Ian Traynor, Saeed Kamali Dehghan and Julian Borger have the story: Iran sanctions to be eased as US and west work out full Geneva deal Over in the House of Commons, foreign secretary William Hague is updating MPs on the terms of the interim agreement reached with Iran on Sunday. He's explaining that many sanctions won't be eased until a full, \"comprehensive solution\" has been reached with Tehran. The fact that we have achieved, for the first time in nearly a decade, a deal that halts and rolls back Iran's nuclear programme means we have reasons to be optimistic that a full, permanent deal can be reached, Hague adds. The statement is being streamed on the rolling news channels. The oil price remains lower today -- with Brent crude down $1.3 at $109.7 per barrel, from over $111 on Friday night. Despite the Nasdaq's early rally, several social media stocks have lost ground on Wall Street this morning. Facebook is down almost 4%, LinkedIn lost 3%, and Twitter (which spurned the Nasdaq for the NYSE index) dropped around 4%. As the BBC's Linda Yueh tweets, stock markets have been pushed to these recent highs by the prospect of continued loose monetary policy from major central banks: On the Nasdaq hitting 4,000 points today... this graph shows how the tech index soared during the dot-com boom to over 5,100 in March 2000, only to tumble ignominiously when the dream turned sour. It's been climbing pretty steadily for most of the last decade -- although the 2008 financial crisis knocked shares back. Here's a graph of the Nasdaq from 1994 to the present (it's just dropped back into the 3,990s...) On Wall Street, the tech-heavy Nasdaq index has broken through the 4,000 point mark for the first time since the final days of the dot-com boom. The Dow also nudged a fresh record high, driven by optimism following the deal over Iran's nuclear programme agreed yesterday (see opening post for the details). 2000, of course, was the high water mark of the original Internet boom -- it popped in the spring of that year, sending stock markets sliding for the next two years. One of the major players in the Bank of England's recent history, Robin Leigh-Pemberton, has passed away. Lord Kingsdown served as governor of the Bank for a decade, from 1983 to 1993. He passed away last night at the age of 86. In a statement released by the Bank, current governor Mark Carney said: On behalf of the Bank and all its staff, both past and present, I extend our most sincere sympathies to Lord Kingsdown\u2019s wife and family. He made a substantial contribution to economic policy and the financial system of the United Kingdom, both in the public and private sector. He will be fondly remembered by current and former colleagues at the Bank of England. Another former governor, Mervyn King, paid a warm -- and typically sporting -- tribute: A tall, imposing and cheerful man, Robin had a talent for inspiring and persuading others to work for him. A born captain, he will be remembered with deep affection by the members of his team. Educated at Eton, then Trinity College, Oxford, Lord Kingsdown's decade at the top of Threadneedle Street saw the Bank move towards targeting price stability as the benchmark for financial stability... He was also at the helm during the Bank of Credit and Commerce International scandal, which saw the Bank of England shut down BCCI in 1991 - at that time, the BoE's biggest intervention of that type. So, to recap: \u2022 The cost of a barrel of Brent crude oil is down almost $2 at around $109 today, on optimism that geopolitical tensions in the Middle East will ease following the deal over Iran's nuclear programme agvreed yesterday (see 10.19am for analyst comment). If sustained, lower energy prices could give the global economy a pre-Christmas pick-me-up. Jeff Duncan, chief executive of Duncan Financial Management in St. Louis, comments: Less tension in the Middle East is always a positive, and any drop in gas prices will essentially act as a tax break for consumers going into the holiday shopping season,\" Duncan said. \"This is a real benefit for the economy. \u2022 Gold remains at its lowest level since early July, pushed down by a new appetite for risk (see 11.59am for details). \u2022 European stock markets began the week by pushing higher, with Germany's DAX reaching yet another record high -- now up 1% at 9310. World markets are also at their highest levels since 2008, and could rise still higher once Wall Street opens. In London the FTSE 100 is up 26 points, or 0.4%. As Brenda Kelly of IG explains, the Iranian deal is driving the market: News that the US has struck a deal with Iran on its nuclear activities has seen both WTI and Brent oil prices decline, and has to a degree lessened the risk premium normally associated with Middle-East tensions. The fall-out has seen stocks for the major oil companies such as BP and Royal Dutch Shell take a tumble in early trade. Today's biggest faller is Randgold Resources, which has lost 2.5% as gold continues its steady price decline. With mining output set to hit record highs this year, the bulls cannot rely on production cuts to offset the price slide or weak demand. Airlines have been clear beneficiaries of the pull-back in the oil price, with International Consolidated Air and easyJet taking the top spots on the UK benchmark, supported by broker upgrades. IAG shares are up 3.2% -- so perhaps they could celebrate by helping the guys at Heathrow fix the lights at Terminal 5..... Back in the financial markets, world stock markets have hit a new five-year high -- even before the New York stock market opened. Bloomberg has the details: The MSCI All-Country World Index advanced 0.2 percent to 401.36 at 7:25 a.m. in New York. Futures on the Standard &amp; Poor\u2019s 500 Index, which capped a seventh weekly gain Nov. 22, rose 0.3%. The Iranian nuclear deal - and the prospect of sanctions against Tehran being eased - continues to be welcomed. As Henk Potts, a strategist at Barclays Wealth &amp; Investment Management in London, put it: Sanctions have been hitting Iran oil dramatically. There is hope that in the long term the supply dynamics will improve. High commodity prices are one of the key costs to businesses and consumers so a decline in oil equates to lightening up the tax burden. More here: Stocks Climb as Oil Declines on Iran Accord; Yen Weakens Over in Greece, three MPs from the neo-nazi Golden Dawn party appeared in court today over charges of setting up and running a criminal organisation. The case against the three MPS, Giorgos Germenis, Panagiotis Iliopoulos and Stathis Boukouras, was adjourned until December 7 to allow them to prepare their defence. Golden Dawn's leader, Nikos Mihaloliakos, and two other MPs remain in custody following the recent clampdown against the party, prompted by the murder of left-wing rapper Pavlos Fyssas two months ago. Golden Dawn supporters held a demonstration outside the Supreme Court as today's hearing began. As the photo above shows, they displayed a banner depicting Mihaloliakos and the two detained MPs (Christos Pappas, in the centre, and Yannis Lagos on the right). The slogan reads: 'No prison for the nationalists, Greece will prevail'. Earlier today, GD announced that a rally will take place on Saturday to demand the release of Mihaloliakos, Pappas and Lagos. The gold price remains at its lowest level since early July today, at $1,231 per ounce. As this graph of the spot price of gold shows, it has been on a downward journey since mid-August: Some analysts reckon gold will fall further as the US Federal Reserve moves closer to slowing its bond-buying programme. At that stage, the yields (interest rates) on government debt could rise - meaning richer pickings for investors. The Fed says it will only start to tighten when economic conditions improve -- at which time there might also be less demand for a safe-haven such as gold*. As VTB Capital put it: Overall sentiment remains bearish, and much will still depend on macro data with bearish implications for gold into 2014 as currency yields gain ground and players turn away from gold in favour of better returns, with little need for inflation or safe-haven hedging in the next year. * - anyone who bought gold at over $1,700 per ounce two years ago may wonder quite how safe it really is... Newsflash from Rome -- the Italian government has called a vote of confidence to push its 2014 budget through the Senate. Reuters has the details: The budget, which includes some timid tax cuts on labour costs and deficit-cutting measures, is currently scheduled to be voted on Tuesday, but the vote could be delayed. Confidence votes are often called to speed through legislation in the Italian parliament. \"The confidence vote is necessary not only to guarantee a quick approval (of the budget law) but also to verify... the trust between the government and its parliamentary majority,\" parliamentary affairs minister Dario Franceschini said on Monday. The government ought to survive the vote. Enrico Letta's coalition looks fairly stable at present, now that the right-wing PdL party has splintered -- with deputy PM Angelino Alfano leading a breakaway faction that should keep supporting the coalition. Although, as Simon Nixon warns in the Wall Street Journal today, the problem with stability is that there's less pressure for reforms. It could be a lively week in Italian politics -- with a vote on expelling Silvio Berlusconi from the Senate due on Wednesday. The former prime minister saw his lingering hopes of a pardon dashed over the weekend, when President Giorgio Napolitano's office said Berlusconi's behaviour and comments did not make such a reprieve possible. On Saturday, Berlusconi accused left-wing partners of perpetrating a 'coup d'etat', and declared that Napolitano should have pardoned him without even being asked. Napolitano didn't take the hint Although today's fall in the oil price sounds like good news for households, motorists and firms, we should remember it rose late last week on fears that the Iranian talks were faltering. And at around $109 per barrel, Brent crude remains some way above the $100 mark which it rose through last summer. Here's a graph showing Brent -- oil sourced from the North Sea -- this year: US crude oil has also fallen today, down over $1 per barrel at $93.6. Significantly cheaper than Brent crude -- after the gap between NYMEX and Brent hit a nine-month high last week. Michael Hewson of CMC Markets reckons the gap could narrow, writing: The weekend news that Iran has apparently reached a deal on reining back its nuclear capability has seen Brent prices drop sharply in early trade as markets factor in a potential lower geopolitical risk premium in the coming months. As with everything with respect to the Middle East the situation on the ground always has the potential to surprise and there remain significant difficulties ahead given the scepticism surrounding the deal from Israel. Questions remain about how the conditions of the deal will be overseen so it is by no means certain the current weakness will be maintained, but given that Brent prices were trading at four week highs at the end of last week, it can be argued that markets hadn't priced in any agreement in the lead up to the weekend, and that probably explains the sharp drop today. More here: Brent risk premium remains high despite Iran deal The US stock market could follow the German DAX by hitting another record high today. Monex Capital reckons the Dow Jones industrial average will climb higher when Wall Street opens (2.30pm GMT). It romped through the 16,000 point mark for the first time last week to close at a new record of almost 16,065. They write: One key story to watch is the falling price of oil on the back of some sanctions against Iran being eased. Cheap crude has the ability to broadly cheer sentiment across the board, although the situation remains delicate amidst concern that Saudi Arabia may look to react in some way to the news - possibly by flooding the market with cheap oil - or that the rhetoric from Israel may indeed escalate. Regardless, those hopes of cheaper energy are helping drive sentiment so ahead of the US open we're calling the DOW up 46 at 16111 and the S&amp;P up 4 at 1809. Just in, UK mortgage approvals were almost 33% higher last month than a year ago, as the British property sector's revival continued. A total of 42,808 loans were approved in October, up from 32,082 in October 2012 when the UK economic climate was more cautious (and before the government began its Help to Buy scheme). The number of new loans was slightly lower than September's 43,182. British Bankers' Association's statistics director, David Dooks, argued though that: the housing market continues to pick up. UK payday loan firms such as Wonga face the prospect of new caps on their lending, writes my colleague Angela Monaghan: The government is planning a new law to cap the cost of payday loans offered by companies such as Wonga, Wizzcash, and QuickQuid. According to the BBC, the Treasury has concluded there is \"growing evidence\" to support a curb on the controversial loans, which can come with annual interest rates of more than 5,000%. Payday lenders have been heavily criticised for targeting vulnerable customers with the promise of fast cash. The City's new regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority, will determine the level of the cap, which will be included in the banking reform bill passing through parliament. Payday loan costs face cap by City regulator It's a big political story,with Labour's Shadow Business Minister, Stella Creasy MP, saying the government has been too slow to act against \"legal loan-sharking\". And chancellor George Osborne has been on the Today programme, arguing that people who believe in free markets also accept that they must be regulated. Our Westminster live-blogger, Andrew Sparrow, has all the details: George Osborne's interviews and payday lending cap announcement: Politics live blog Channel 4's Faisal Islam flags up that Australia's payday lenders are now restricted from ramping up repayment levels: Mike van Dulken, head of research at Accendo Markets, point out that traders are still fretting about the health of the eurozone economy - and wondering when the US Federal Reserve might begin slowing its huge stimulus package. He writes: News of a deal on Iran's Nuclear capabilities is good, but not enough to counter market fears of Fed QE3 tapering being delivered just before Christmas festivities really get going and questions over the Eurozone's recovery. Another day, another record high on the German stock market. The wave of post-Iranian deal optimism pushed shares higher in Frankfurt, with the DAX index up 0.7%, or 62 points, to an all-time high of 9281. Other markets are also gaining, as Monday gets off to an upbeat start. Didier Duret, chief investment officer at ABN-AMRO Private Banking, summed up the mood: The Iran deal reduces the medium term global geopolitical risk. In the short term, it should improve the equity market's technical picture and inflows into risky assets. Airline shares are leading the charge -- they're an obvious benefactor from the lower oil price. IAG, parent company of British Airways and Iberia, are up more than 3%, with Easyjet close behind. Energy firms, though, are leading the fallers with oil exploration firm BG Group down 1%. Randgold's down almost 2%, tracking the drop in the gold price overnight. FTSE 100: up 29 points at 6703, +0.44% French CAC: up 18 points at 4297, +0.43% Spanish IBEX: up 30 points at 9,707, + 0.3% Italian FTSE MIB: flat The Geneva deal lasts for six months, and oil traders are predicting a surge of Iranian oil onto the markets in mid-2014 -- if this interim agreement is replaced by a permanent deal. As Chee Tat Tan, investment analyst at Phillip Futures in Singapore, put it: What really concerns the market is what will happen after the six-month period, when more Iranian crude could flood the markets. The worst-case scenario, though, is that the deal could be sunk by opposition in Iran and America (as our diplomatic colleague Julian Borger explains in this Q&amp;A). It may also take Tehran some time to get its oil production facilities firing on all cylinders, as this newsflash from Reuters suggests: 08:36:18 RTRS - MOSCOW - IEA HEAD SAYS IT WOULD BE HARD FOR IRAN TO REGAIN PREVIOUS OIL OUTPUT LEVELS QUICKLY IF EXPORT RESTRICTIONS LIFTED Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of events across the financial markets, the world economy, the eurozone and the business world. The historic deal over Iran's nuclear programme agreed yesterday is driving down the price of oil and gold, and giving another nudge to already buoyant stock markets. The price of a barrel of Brent crude slipped by over 2.5% already today, currently down $2.3 at $108.77/barrel. It follows the news that the tense negotiations in Geneva had delivered an agreement to restrict Tehran's nuclear work \u2013which some analysts believe could be the most important breakthrough in the region in years. Hopes that tensions in the Middle East will be diminished by the deal are proving costly to gold bugs too.The bullion price shedding 1% to $1,229 per ounce, its lowest level since July. The dollar has strengthened, pushing down the Japanese yen -- cheering news for the Tokyo stock market where the Nikkei surged 1.5% to almost its highest level of 2013. Stan Shamu of IG said the Iranian deal could have added to the \"risk mood\" in Asia today. If sustained, lower oil prices could give the global economic recovery a helping hand, by lowering fuel costs for consumers and firms. In Europe, the major stock markets have all opened a little higher - up around 0.5% in early trading. Our latest news story on the deal, and how it was achieved, is here: Secret US-Iran talks paved way for nuclear deal It explains that Sunday's deal will release restrictions on Iran's trading of gold, petrochemicals, car and plane parts. In return, it will: \u2022 Stop enriching uranium above 5%, reactor-grade, and dilute its stock of 20%-enriched uranium, removing a major proliferation concern. \u2022 Not increase its stockpile of low-enriched uranium. \u2022 Freeze its enrichment capacity by not installing any more centrifuges, leaving more than half of its existing 16,000 centrifuges inoperable. \u2022 Not fuel or commission the heavy-water reactor it is building in Arak or build a reprocessing plant that could produce plutonium from the spent fuel. \u2022 Accept more intrusive nuclear inspections by the International Atomic Energy Agency, including daily visits to some facilities. The deal has been cheered in Iran, where negotiators were met by cheering crowds. But with Israel calling it a 'historic mistake', caution may still be needed. So, what else is afoot today? There's two big stories in the UK -- Royal Bank of Scotland is under pressure after being accused of deliberately driving some small firms to the wall: RBS accused of pushing small businesses to the edge And the UK government is limbering into action against payday lenders by capping loans. In the eurozone, tension is mounting in Italy ahead of a vote on Wednesday on whether Silvio Berlusconi should be expelled from the Senate. While in Greece, the government is striving to reach a deal with its lenders over its next aid tranche, as heavy flooding hits part of the country. I'll be tracking all the key developments through the day as usual...",

    "webTitle": "Walmart's Doug McMillon to replace Mike Duke as chief executive", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The world's biggest retailer, Walmart, announced on Monday that it is to replace its president and chief executive, Mike Duke, who is stepping aside after a year in which the company has struggled with sluggish sales and labour disputes. Doug McMillon, currently CEO of Walmart's international division, will replace Duke as president and CEO of Walmart Stores on 31 January. Duke relinquishes the reins five years in charge, although he will stay on as chairman of the company's executive committee. Duke has overseen a disappointing period for Walmart. The company's shares have underperformed, and it has found itself criticised over working conditions. Activists are planning a series of strikes on Black Friday, seen as one of the most important days in the US retail calendar. McMillon, 47, is a veteran of the company. He worked as a \"summer associate\" for Walmart in 1984 before returning in 1990, according to his profile on Walmart\u2019s corporate website. He was president and chief executive of Sam's Club, a subsidiary of Walmart, from 2006 to 2009. \u201cThe opportunity to lead Walmart is a great privilege,\u201d McMillon said in a statement. \u201cOur company has a rich history of delivering value to customers across the globe and, as their needs grow and change, we will be there to serve them. Our management team is talented and experienced, and our strategy gives me confidence that our future is bright.\" Walmart's share price has risen by just over half, during Duke's tenure as chief executive. The S&amp;P 500 has more than doubled over the same period. Duke, 63, will continue as chairman of the executive committee of the board and stay on as an adviser to McMillon for a year. Duke will be paid $1.1m for the year to January 31 2015, Walmart said in a regulatory filing. Walmart shares were trading at $79.96 before the bell. Walmart attempted to put a positive gloss on Monday's announcement. \u201cThis leadership change comes at a time of strength and growth at Walmart,\u201d said Rob Walton, chairman of the board of directors, in a statement. \u201cThe company has the right strategy to serve the changing customer around the world, and Doug has been actively involved in this process. The company has a strong management team to execute that strategy.\u201d Once a retailing powerhouse, Walmart has struggled significantly this year. Its same-store sales \u2013 a measure of profitability \u2013 fell in each quarter, and MKM Partners, a Wall Street research firm, expects more of the same in the last three months of the year. The company attributed the fall to several different factors, ranging from government policy changes to the struggling economy. It has also faced significant labour disputes with its employees, some of which have organised to complain about the company's low pay. Last week, a Walmart store in Ohio took up a charity collection of canned food for Thanksgiving \u2013 for its own workers. Walmart recently launched a cut-price brand, called Price First, that will include kitchen staples like ketchup, mustard, peanut butter and macaroni and cheese. The line is designed to keep up with Walmart's grocery offerings to low-income consumers, articularly those who buy supplies with food stamps. Patrick McKeever of MKM Partners recently noted that Walmart, which already competes with giants like Costco, BJs and Sam's Club, is now facing a new crop of rivals as it \"continues to lose share to smaller-format retailers, including the dollar stores\". Walmart has also struggled with its growth in international markets, where its expenses have been outpacing sales, according to Deutsche Bank analyst Paul Trussell. It has started downsizing in India and Mexico, while closing 50 underperforming stores in Brazil and China, McKeever said in a recent note to clients. Worker group Our Walmart has promised 1,500 protests on Black Friday. The group is calling for Walmart, which made $17bn profit in 2012, to pay employees a minimum of $25,000 a year for full-time work. Our Walmart member Tiffany Beroid, one of more than 800,000 store workers who earn less than $25,000 a year, said:\"Walmart has been heading in the wrong direction, and it's a testament to the pressure the company is feeling that they're changing leadership at this moment. \"We're happy to see Mr McMillon acknowledge the hard work of associates in his statement this morning, and we hope that this appreciation translates into improving jobs for Walmart workers. We sincerely hope that Mr McMillon will answer the country's calls for Walmart to publicly commit to paying $25,000 a year, providing full-time work and ending its illegal retaliation against its own employees.\" On Monday it emerged that Walmart had donated $425,000 to state senate Republicans in New York over the past three years. The sum included a $100,000 donation in March which coincided with GOP state senators pushing for a tax credit that could have saved the company millions of dollars.",

      "bodyText": "Drinks giant Diageo has offered to sell most of its Whyte &amp; Mackay business to address regulators' concerns over competition in the blended Scotch whisky market. The offer, made to the Office of Fair Trading, followed Diageo's purchase of a 25% stake in Indian company United Spirits, which owns Whyte &amp; Mackay. The deal prompted complaints to the OFT by retailers about possible price rises for bottled blended whisky sold in the UK. Both Diageo and United Spirits supply spirits in the UK and around the world, and Diageo's Bell's whisky competes with Whyte &amp; Mackay's own-label and branded blended whisky. An OFT investigation concluded the concerns were justified, and it is now considering Diageo's offer to sell most of the Whyte &amp; Mackay business with the exception of two malt distilleries at Dalmore and Tamnavulin. The OFT said that other manufacturers of blended whisky would not be able to offset the loss of competition likely to result from the merger. Chris Walters, OFT chief economist, said: \"These companies are two of the leading suppliers of blended bottled whisky in the UK, especially to supermarkets and other large retailers. \"Our investigation considered a wide range of evidence and we concluded that the likely loss of competition could give rise to higher prices for retailers, and ultimately consumers.\" Diageo, which is behind brands including Guinness, Smirnoff, Johnnie Walker and Baileys, said it would be assisting the OFT with its ongoing work. \"The [proposed] remedy involves the sale of Whyte &amp; Mackay's Invergordon, Jura and Fettercairn distilleries, and all of W&amp;M's central operations,\" a Diageo spokeswoman said.

      "body": "<p>George Osborne has challenged Labour to explain why it is continuing to take donations and soft loans from the Co-op Bank at a time when members of the bank's staff are about to be made redundant and pensioners stand to lose income owing to the sacrifices being made by bondholders.</p> <p>The chancellor was speaking for the first time since he said he would hold an independent inquiry into the problems of the bank, including the role of politicians and the regulatory system.</p> <p>Osborne's comments came as he said there was a quantum difference in the way the government had handled the matter of the Co-op Bank and the attitude of the previous Labour administration.</p> <p>Effectively challenging the new owners of the Co-op to change its relationship with Labour, he said: \"At the very moment while this institution is in trouble, where bond holders are making sacrifices, pensioners that rely on those bonds have to make sacrifices and people working for the Co-op face losing their job, at the same time Labour is taking money cash and soft loans.\"</p> <p>The Conservatives point out loans were made or renewed to Labour on 1 April, only 11 days after the Co-op reported a loss of \u00a3600m on 21 March.</p> <p>Osborne argued that the regulatory system worked in the case of the planned takeover of Lloyds branches by the Co-op in 2013, but said the same checks did not lead under Labour government to a block on the merger of the Co-op and the Britannia building society, seen as one of the causes of the Co-op's downfall.</p> <p>The chancellor accepted that the government had wanted the Co-op takeover of Lloyds branches. He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: \"We wanted new challengers out on the high street and new banks so there is a competition in a properly regulated market.\"</p> <p>He said the EU and the Vickers commission had both recommended that Lloyds sell some of its branches.

      "bodyText": "George Osborne has challenged Labour to explain why it is continuing to take donations and soft loans from the Co-op Bank at a time when members of the bank's staff are about to be made redundant and pensioners stand to lose income owing to the sacrifices being made by bondholders. The chancellor was speaking for the first time since he said he would hold an independent inquiry into the problems of the bank, including the role of politicians and the regulatory system. Osborne's comments came as he said there was a quantum difference in the way the government had handled the matter of the Co-op Bank and the attitude of the previous Labour administration. Effectively challenging the new owners of the Co-op to change its relationship with Labour, he said: \"At the very moment while this institution is in trouble, where bond holders are making sacrifices, pensioners that rely on those bonds have to make sacrifices and people working for the Co-op face losing their job, at the same time Labour is taking money cash and soft loans.\" The Conservatives point out loans were made or renewed to Labour on 1 April, only 11 days after the Co-op reported a loss of \u00a3600m on 21 March. Osborne argued that the regulatory system worked in the case of the planned takeover of Lloyds branches by the Co-op in 2013, but said the same checks did not lead under Labour government to a block on the merger of the Co-op and the Britannia building society, seen as one of the causes of the Co-op's downfall. The chancellor accepted that the government had wanted the Co-op takeover of Lloyds branches. He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: \"We wanted new challengers out on the high street and new banks so there is a competition in a properly regulated market.\" He said the EU and the Vickers commission had both recommended that Lloyds sell some of its branches. He said: \"Lloyds came to us and said we think the Co-op is the best company to take over these branches.\" But he added: \"The key point is that it did not happen, so in other words the system worked because when we saw the Co-op was in no state to take over these branches the alarm bell rang and the alarm bell was heard. That is a massive difference from the past.\" The chancellor denied that the Treasury minister Mark Hoban had as many as 30 meetings with Co-op staff.

The shire of Serpentine Jarrahdale, on the outer south-east of Perth has the highest percentage of mortgage holders in the country. The figures show 55% of houses in that area are owned with a mortgage.

The local government areas of Melbourne, Perth and Sydney are the top three for renters (excluding government and community housing). Among other areas with more than 30% renters in New South Wales are North Sydney, Ashfield, Waverley, Marrickville and elsewhere, Adelaide and Port Phillip.</p> <p>It will also be no great shock to anyone to discover that the most expensive places to buy houses are in Sydney.</p> <p>Eleven of the 15 local government areas with the most expensive median mortgage are in Sydney.

Not surprisingly there is not much movement among areas. Expensive areas stay expensive. Of the 15 most expensive areas in 2011, 12 were in the top 15 in 2006. Only occasionally do you get boom areas such as Roebourne bursting into the top level \u2013 shifting from the 55th most expensive area in 2006 to tied for fourth in 2011.</p> <p>If we break it down to state level, it is rare even for an area which in 2006 had mortgage rates below the state median, to be above the median level in 2011. In Victoria for example, only the shire of Queenscliff shifted from below to above the median. In South Australia only the Yorke Peninsula shires of Tumby Bay and the regional mining centre of Whyalla shifted from the bottom half to the top.</p> <p>But what is interesting is looking at the growth of each end of the housing sector.</p> <p>Western Australia and Queensland, due to their high number of remote areas, have the biggest disparity between the most expensive and the cheapest areas. But the biggest difference between the richest 10% and the areas with the median level mortgages is in New South Wales.</p> <p>The median mortgage in the shire of Warringah with the 10% highest median mortgage payments is $2,600. This is 1.93 times the size of the $1,496 median mortgage in the shire of Lismore, the area that ranks at 50%. In Tasmania, the difference between areas in the same percentile ranges is 1.25 times.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Grogonomics 2\">  <iframe src=\"https://charts.datawrapper.de/7PoU8/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"480\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>In all states, the ratio between the areas with 90th percentile mortgage rate and the 50th percentile have either decreased since 2006 or stayed the same. If we were talking about income, this would be a sign of reduced inequality, but here it demonstrates that house prices in the median level across the nation have risen faster than have prices at the top end. In effect it is becoming relatively more expensive to buy a house in the middle range:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Grogonomics 3\">  <iframe src=\"https://charts.datawrapper.de/qRvTy/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"480\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>This aspect extends to the lower range of the market as well. Only in Western Australia and Tasmania did the median mortgages in the higher end areas rise faster than the bottom end.</p> <p>And this encapsulates the problem. Most people looking to enter the housing market are not looking to buy high-priced homes in Manly, Stonington, Burnside or Cottlesloe. So while newspapers are attracted to stories of first-home buyers buying a<a href=\"http://news.domain.com.au/domain/real-estate-news/firsthome-buyer-pays-12-million-in-redfern-20131019-2vtdu.html\"> million-dollar terrace home</a> in Redfern, they are the exception. But because the prices of homes in the more median priced areas is rising faster than in the high priced suburbs it has become harder for most first-home buyers to enter the market.</p> <p>From 2006 to 2011, the median household income only grew by 17% but across Australian median mortgage payments in that period increased 38.5%. Similarly the average first-home buyer mortgage grew by 26%.</p> <p>Despite the prices paid by first-home buyers not growing since 2011, in that time first-home buyers have been squeezed out of the market. Because while the ability for first-home buyers to pay for a home has not grown, the supply of houses available at that price has declined:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Grogonomics 4\">  <iframe src=\"https://charts.datawrapper.de/bmp7O/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"480\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>It would seem the growth in housing prices to 2011 has put home ownership out of reach for many. The increase in prices across the board \u2013 but especially at the lower to median level \u2013 means that for many young people the great Australian dream of home ownership will forever remain a dream.</p>",

Of the 15 most expensive areas in 2011, 12 were in the top 15 in 2006. Only occasionally do you get boom areas such as Roebourne bursting into the top level \u2013 shifting from the 55th most expensive area in 2006 to tied for fourth in 2011. If we break it down to state level, it is rare even for an area which in 2006 had mortgage rates below the state median, to be above the median level in 2011. In Victoria for example, only the shire of Queenscliff shifted from below to above the median. In South Australia only the Yorke Peninsula shires of Tumby Bay and the regional mining centre of Whyalla shifted from the bottom half to the top. But what is interesting is looking at the growth of each end of the housing sector. Western Australia and Queensland, due to their high number of remote areas, have the biggest disparity between the most expensive and the cheapest areas. But the biggest difference between the richest 10% and the areas with the median level mortgages is in New South Wales. The median mortgage in the shire of Warringah with the 10% highest median mortgage payments is $2,600. This is 1.93 times the size of the $1,496 median mortgage in the shire of Lismore, the area that ranks at 50%. In Tasmania, the difference between areas in the same percentile ranges is 1.25 times. In all states, the ratio between the areas with 90th percentile mortgage rate and the 50th percentile have either decreased since 2006 or stayed the same. If we were talking about income, this would be a sign of reduced inequality, but here it demonstrates that house prices in the median level across the nation have risen faster than have prices at the top end. In effect it is becoming relatively more expensive to buy a house in the middle range: This aspect extends to the lower range of the market as well. Only in Western Australia and Tasmania did the median mortgages in the higher end areas rise faster than the bottom end. And this encapsulates the problem. Most people looking to enter the housing market are not looking to buy high-priced homes in Manly, Stonington, Burnside or Cottlesloe. So while newspapers are attracted to stories of first-home buyers buying a million-dollar terrace home in Redfern, they are the exception. But because the prices of homes in the more median priced areas is rising faster than in the high priced suburbs it has become harder for most first-home buyers to enter the market. From 2006 to 2011, the median household income only grew by 17% but across Australian median mortgage payments in that period increased 38.5%. Similarly the average first-home buyer mortgage grew by 26%. Despite the prices paid by first-home buyers not growing since 2011, in that time first-home buyers have been squeezed out of the market. Because while the ability for first-home buyers to pay for a home has not grown, the supply of houses available at that price has declined: It would seem the growth in housing prices to 2011 has put home ownership out of reach for many. The increase in prices across the board \u2013 but especially at the lower to median level \u2013 means that for many young people the great Australian dream of home ownership will forever remain a dream.",

      "bodyText": "Coastal towns and cities account for the five worst places in Britain for personal bankruptcies, and 21 in the worst 50, according to an analysis highlighting the speed at which seaside resorts and ports are falling behind the rest of the country economically. They include Hull, newly crowned city of culture, which is said to have the fifth-highest rate of insolvencies. The findings are based on 2012 figures, well before the recent announcement by BAE Systems that there will be no more shipbuilding in Portsmouth, costing 940 jobs. The highest numbers were in Torbay, Devon, with 54 new cases of insolvency per 10,000 population, compared with a national average of 25, said accountants Wilkins Kennedy. The town was followed by the Rhyl and Prestatyn area in north Wales, with 53; Scarborough and Blackpool, with 48; and Hull, with 44. Other coastal areas featuring prominently included Runcorn and Widnes, Cheshire, in eighth place and Great Yarmouth, Norfolk, in 10th. Stoke-on-Trent and Tamworth, in Staffordshire, and Mansfield, in Nottinghamshire, took up the other places among the worst bankruptcy rates. Figures include bankruptcy orders, individual voluntary arrangements and debt relief orders. Anthony Cork, partner at Wilkins Kennedy, said: \"Many of our coastal towns have been suffering a slow decline for many years, as tourism struggles to compete with cheap overseas travel, fishing quotas are slashed and other maritime industry has all but died off. These figures highlight how desperate their plight still is \u2013 with even traditionally popular tourist destinations suffering severe pain. \"Within just the top five of the personal bankruptcy league table, you can see a pretty broad cross-section of the UK's picture-postcard seaside economy failing. Many will be surprised to see places like Torbay, with its reputation for luring genteel, affluent holidaymakers to the 'English Riviera', sitting right at the top alongside Blackpool, the UK's answer to Las Vegas, and more traditional bucket-and-spade resorts like Rhyl and Scarborough.\" Although there were exceptions in the south of England, such as Brighton or Bournemouth, which had diversified, the vast majority of towns relying on the seasonal tourist trade were struggling badly. \"The recession has hit hard despite the temptation for more people to stay and holiday in the UK instead of going abroad,\" said Cork. \"For every hot-spot like Newquay or Padstow, there are many more places where flagging tourism plus the lack of permanent, well-paid employment are taking their toll.\" Cork said the government's \u00a329m coastal communities fund was a step in the right direction but that such investment was unlikely to go very far. He added: \"Students and graduates with high levels of debt will find it hard to return to their home towns if they can't find a decent job, but unless young talent can be persuaded to stay, it's difficult for businesses to invest, creating a vicious cycle. \"Funding for small businesses remains very tight at the moment, particularly where trade is seasonal, putting a huge strain on the self-employed, who may have ploughed a substantial proportion of their personal assets into their businesses or put them up as security.\"",
