After taking evidence from a range of experts, the all-party tax responsibility group, made up of British MPs and peers, found that G20 nations and others were still falling short in the battle against aggressive tax planning by big businesses. The report, published on Thursday, paid tribute to tax experts from the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), who spent two years working on reforms, published last year, that were supported by more than 60 countries, representing 90% of the world economy. However, parliamentarians have now called for further, more radical, reforms, particularly in the face of new tax structures available to internet groups. \u201cThese proposals are a \u2018sticking plaster\u2019 on a global tax system that is struggling to remain fit for purpose with the growth of multinational companies operating in a digital environment,\u201d the report said. Their concern was echoed by leading international poverty charities. Oxfam said: \u201cToday\u2019s report is a welcome admission by MPs that the world has so far failed to tackle tax dodging.\u201d A spokesperson for Christian Aid said: \u201cEvery tax scandal leads to promises of a crackdown, but the last government rarely matched words with action ... Theresa May\u2019s government must prove it takes this issue seriously by adopting the proposals in today\u2019s report in full.\u201d The parliamentarians\u2019 report describes the UK as having been a \u201cdifficult friend\u201d to efforts to reform global taxation. Margaret Hodge, who chairs the all-party group, said: \u201cThe government has been facing both ways. While publicly proclaiming their determination to tackle global tax avoidance, they have been encouraging these practices by changes they have made to the UK tax system and by refusing privately to agree to some key OECD proposals.\u201d There are concerns among some international tax reformers that Britain\u2019s exit from the European Union may see it take an even more aggressive approach to tax competition. In a leaked memo, revealed by Reuters, OECD head of tax Pascal Saint-Amans, wrote: \u201cThe negative impact of the Brexit on UK competitiveness may push the UK to be even more aggressive in its tax offer ... A further step in that direction would really turn the UK into a tax haven type of economy.\u201d Before he was replaced as chancellor, George Osborne said he thought the UK should \u201cget on with it\u201d and prepare for its new position outside the EU by slashing corporation tax to less than 15% \u2013 markedly below all other major world economies. Business lobbyists, and some politicians, have suggested the tax is so open to abuse by multinationals that it is becoming increasingly untenable. Last October, the OECD released what it called \u201cextremely conservative\u201d estimates suggesting large global businesses were shifting profits and eroding the tax receipts of economies around the world at a cost of $100bn-$240bn (\u00a365bn-\u00a3160bn) a year \u2013 equivalent to between 4% and 10% of global corporation tax revenues.",

    "webTitle": "What incentive do SoftBank's advisers have to question ARM deal? | Graham Ruddick", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The money involved in SoftBank\u2019s takeover of tech giant ARM Holdings is extraordinary. As part of the \u00a324bn deal, ARM\u2019s 4,000 workers could share more than \u00a3300m. Simon Segars, the chief executive, and Mike Muller, the chief technology officer, are likely to get about \u00a355m between them. But it is the size of the fees and expenses from the deal that really stand out \u2013 \u00a3349.6m. SoftBank will pay out between \u00a3247.2m and \u00a3284.6m, while ARM will pay \u00a365m. SoftBank\u2019s lenders will earn up to \u00a3110.4m, while the financial advisers on both sides will collect \u00a396.4m, the lawyers \u00a314.5m, and the PRs \u00a36m. The companies in line for a windfall include Goldman Sachs, Barclays and City spinners Brunswick and Finsbury. These eye-watering fees remind me of the question that has been brought to the fore by the BHS scandal \u2013 what incentive do any of the advisers working on the deal have for it to fall over? Investment banks and PR advisers rely on transactions such as SoftBank-Arm to make their money. As Michael Sherwood, a vice-chairman of Goldman Sachs, told MPs investigating the collapse of BHS, Goldman was willing to advise Sir Philip Green for free so that it was in the \u201cgoalmouth\u201d when he eventually did a \u201csignificant transaction\u201d. I am not suggesting that SoftBank\u2019s purchase of ARM is as dubious as Green\u2019s sale of BHS to serial bankrupt Dominic Chappell. SoftBank has a track record as a responsible business owner and has offered to give a legal undertaking that it will double ARM\u2019s workforce in Cambridge over the next five years. But, with such an enormous pot of gold available for making takeovers like this happen, there is a notable lack of opposing forces. This is why the government should respond to the BHS scandal by introducing new rules that firmly establish the responsibilities of company directors to their employees, including pay, working conditions and pensions. Such a move could have wide-ranging implications in the future, such as ensuring that companies have a legal obligation to consider the impact of a takeover on employees. It could even provide the loophole that allows the government to step in and block the sale of strategic companies to foreign buyers. Next shoppers prefer cash Lord Wolfson, the chief executive of Next, has become renowned for his gloomy assessments of the British economy and the weather. In the clothing retailer\u2019s latest trading update, Wolfson dedicated an entire segment to the \u201cimpact of the EU referendum\u201d. However, the macro-economic uncertainty should not mask the structural challenge facing Next. The company\u2019s success in recent years has been underpinned by its online and catalogue credit service. This service allows shoppers to buy clothing from Next that they may not otherwise be able to afford, but also ensures a windfall for the company due to the 22.9% interest it charges on offering customers credit. In the year to the end of January, Next had 2.6 million credit customers and recorded net income on the interest charges of \u00a3188m. However, the number of customers using credit with Next is now falling. The company has pencilled in a decline of 5% in credit customers this year and warned it will \u201ctake a number of years for our credit customer base to stabilise\u201d. Consumers are increasingly keen to pay upfront when shopping online and are reluctant to take on more debt. This decline means Next is losing competitive advantage over other high street chains. Shares in the company are down 27% in 2016 and are trading at levels not seen for three years. Wolfson is a shrewd operator, and Next\u2019s sale rose slightly in the past three months after a fall in the previous quarter. But the company, which was a stock market darling not so long ago, now looks as vulnerable to the fluctuations of fashion as Marks &amp; Spencer, its great rival. Berkeley bosses are their own best customers If you judge the health of a company by whether its bosses buy the products or use the services, then Berkeley Group Holding is in good shape. The London-focused housebuilder published its annual report on Wednesday and the section on related party transactions is a fascinating read. It reveals that Tony Pidgley, the founder and chairman, and Rob Perrins, the group chief executive, paid \u00a3378,593 and \u00a3155,167 respectively for Berkeley to carry out work at their own homes. Berkeley assures us that these transaction took place through a scheme whereby \u201celigible employees\u201d can enter into an arrangement with the company \u201cat commercial rates, in accordance with the relevant policies of the group\u201d. Berkeley\u2019s directors are also buying new homes from the company. Karl Whiteman, head of its East Thames division, has agreed to pay \u00a3650,000 for an apartment at its Royal Arsenal Riverside development. This transaction is so large that Berkeley shareholders will have to approve it at the annual meeting in September. But Whiteman is not the only director to have bought a home from Berkeley in the past three years. Perrins paid \u00a32.1m for a new apartment on the Strand, while non-executive Diana Brightmore-Armour paid \u00a33m for an apartment in the same development and executive director Greg Fry bought flats in two other projects. If Brexit does stop foreign investors buying luxury property in London, at least Berkeley knows it can rely on its board.",

      "bodyText": "The top two executives at ARM Holdings will share a payout of up to \u00a355m when the British microchip designer is bought by Japan\u2019s SoftBank, terms of the sale reveal. SoftBank\u2019s \u00a324bn takeover will allow Simon Segars, ARM\u2019s chief executive, to receive \u00a317 for each of the 668,432 shares he owns, bringing in \u00a311.4m. Mike Muller, the chief technology officer, will be paid \u00a322.7m for the 1.34m shares he and his family own. The two men will also receive shares granted under ARM\u2019s long-term incentive plan and deferred annual bonus scheme. Those shares are worth up to \u00a313.1m for Segars and \u00a37.2m for Muller, though performance requirements mean the shares are unlikely to pay out in full. Muller was one of ARM\u2019s founders in 1990 and Segars was the company\u2019s 16th employee. Chris Kennedy, the finance director who joined last September, will get \u00a3344,352 for the ARM shares he owns, but is in line for a maximum of \u00a36m from share awards for a year\u2019s work when the deal completes next month. ARM recommended the takeover, the biggest-ever acquisition of a European technology company, in an offer document sent to shareholders. The UK company\u2019s shareholders are due to meet to approve the takeover, announced last month after just two weeks of talks, at a meeting on 30 August. To secure the deal, and the approval of the UK government, SoftBank has promised to keep ARM\u2019s headquarters in Cambridge and to double the size of its UK workforce of 1,695 in the next five years. It made the pledges in legally binding undertakings, the first time a company has done so since rules were introduced last year amid concerns about foreign takeovers of UK companies. The takeover will also be a big payday for investment banks, lawyers and other advisers who will share \u00a3118m in fees. SoftBank\u2019s bill for advisers comes to \u00a353m and ARM\u2019s is \u00a365m. The biggest payments for advice go to the companies\u2019 investment banks. SoftBank will pay \u00a345.2m for financial and corporate broking advice to Mizuho Securities, Raine Group of the US, and the UK boutique Robey Warshaw, which has muscled in on some of the biggest deals of recent years. SoftBank will also pay up to \u00a3110m in fees to Mizuho for a \u00a37.3bn loan to fund the takeover. Including those costs and \u00a3121.5m for stamp duty and other fees, the Japanese company\u2019s bill comes in at between \u00a3247m and \u00a3285m. ARM is paying \u00a351.2m to its bankers, led by Goldman Sachs and Lazard with UBS and Barclays also involved. SoftBank is paying \u00a35.5m to its legal advisers, the City firm Freshfields and Morrison Foerster of the US. Rival UK \u201cmagic circle\u201d firm Slaughter and May and New York\u2019s Davis Polk &amp; Wardwell will share \u00a39m in fees from ARM. The other big bills are for public relations advice. Finsbury, which is part of WPP, will share up to \u00a32m of SoftBank\u2019s money with Sard Verbinnen of the US, while Finsbury\u2019s London rival Brunswick will take the full \u00a34m ARM expects to spend on PR.",

      "bodyText": "The City is braced for the Bank of England to cut interest rates to a new record low after Threadneedle Street was provided with fresh evidence of the hit taken by the economy in the immediate post-Brexit-vote period. The Bank\u2019s nine-strong monetary policy team is expected to cut borrowing costs from 0.5% \u2013 where they have been pegged since March 2009 \u2013 in response to signs that all parts of the economy have been affected by a slowdown in orders and output. Some City analysts believe the Bank may be tempted to cut interest rates to 0.1%, although the majority believe Thursday\u2019s announcement will be a reduction to 0.25% despite the latest gloomy health check on the economy from Markit/Cips. The much-watched barometer of the state of manufacturing, construction and services found that the deterioration in the weeks immediately following the referendum pointed to the economy contracting by 0.4% in the third quarter of 2016. Earlier this week, Markit/Cips said its final estimate of the state of manufacturing in July was even more negative than its flash estimate released a little less than a fortnight ago. An updated report on the services sector, published on Tuesday underlined the blow to a sector that accounts for almost four-fifths of the economy\u2019s output. The final purchasing managers\u2019 index for services for July fell from 52.3 to 47.4 in June \u2013 the sharpest drop on record and in line with a flash estimate provided by Markit/Cips just under two weeks ago. A composite PMI, including manufacturing as well as services, showed a slightly bigger fall than first feared, declining from 52.5 to 47.5. Construction was not included in the original flash estimate of economic conditions in the aftermath of the Brexit vote, but the all-sector PMI fell from 51.9 in June to 47.3 in July, its lowest level since the economy was in recession in April 2009. Any reading below 50 indicates that activity is contracting. Chris Williamson, Markit\u2019s chief economist, said: \u201cThe marked service sector downturn follows news from sister PMI surveys showing construction activity suffering its steepest decline since mid-2009 and manufacturing output contracting at the fastest rate since late 2012. At these levels, the PMI data are collectively signalling a 0.4% quarterly rate of decline of GDP. \u201cIt\u2019s too early to say if the surveys will remain in such weak territory in coming months, leaving substantial uncertainty over the extent of any potential downturn. However, the unprecedented month-on-month drop in the all-sector index has undoubtedly increased the chances of the UK sliding into at least a mild recession.\u201d Samuel Tombs, a UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said: \u201cThe collapse in the business activity index to its lowest level since March 2009 shows that uncertainty about the UK\u2019s future trading arrangements has had a more malign impact on the UK economy than the eurozone\u2019s debt crisis ever did.\u201d Tombs added that the Bank of England tended to cut interest rates by 0.5 percentage points when the PMIs were as weak as they were in July. \u201cBut with inflation likely to overshoot the committee\u2019s target as a result of sterling\u2019s depreciation and zero rates likely to adversely impact pension funds and banks\u2019 profitability, we think that the MPC will be cautious and only cut bank rate to 0.25%,\u201d he said. The TUC general secretary, Frances O\u2019Grady, said: \u201cAction from the Bank of England to help keep the economy moving will be welcome. But with interests rates already so low, it\u2019s the government that can make the biggest difference. The TUC has published an action plan to protect jobs and growth. The government must immediately give the go-ahead for a third runway at Heathrow, bring forward major new infrastructure projects like high-speed rail and announce a big expansion in housebuilding.\u201d",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "HSBC has admitted it is breaching a US regulator\u2019s order to bolster its defences against financial crime, as the UK\u2019s biggest bank announced a slump in first-half profits in \u201cturbulent\u201d markets hit by Brexit. The bank announced its first share buyback of $2.5bn (\u00a31.8bn) \u2013 following the sale of its Brazilian business \u2013 which buoyed its shares despite the 29% fall in first-half profits to $9.7bn. The shares rose 4.5% even as promises of rising dividends were quashed and it scrapped a timetable to achieve by 2017 a 10% return on equity \u2013 a closely watched measure of performance for shareholders. A series of legal disclosures confirmed it had received requests for information from regulators around the world about Mossack Fonseca, the Panama law firm linked to tax haven companies, and was continuing to be investigated for tax avoidance activities of its Swiss arm. Among the legal disclosures was a reference to an order dated October 2010 with the US Office of the Comptroller of the Currency requiring it to set up \u201ceffective compliance risk management programme across HSBC\u2019s US businesses\u201d. The bank said: \u201cHSBC Bank USA is not currently in compliance with the OCC order. Steps are being taken to address the requirements of the orders.\u201d In February, the bank revealed an official monitor, which the US authorities installed after a $1.9bn fine over money laundering four years ago, had raised significant concerns about the slow pace of change to its procedures to combat crime. A senior HSBC currency trader was arrested in New York last month over allegations of defrauding clients, a move which the bank acknowledged had sparked some queries from customers. Stuart Gulliver, the chief executive, focused on adjusted profit of $10.8bn, down 14%, which the bank described as a \u201creasonable performance in the face of considerable uncertainty\u201d. He said another buyback could take place next year when the bank\u2019s US arm releases cash to the wider group for the first time in a decade. Explaining why the bank had abandoned a \u201cprogressive\u201d dividend policy, Gulliver said: \u201cPeople assumed it would mean we automatically increased the dividend irrespective of what was going in the world.\u201d Instead the payout would be set 0.51c per share - its current level and quashing fears it would be cut. The share buyback had to be approved by the Bank of England, and comes after stress tests on 51 European banks which sparked concerns among investors about the financial strength of some major lenders. Some analysts were cautious. Gary Greenwood, an analyst at Shore Capital, pointed out the 10% return on equity target being abandoned was only set a year ago. \u201cIt is therefore clear to us that the fundamentals of the business continue to deteriorate and the decision to return a small amount of capital to shareholders by way of a share buy-back should not detract from this,\u201d he said. The HSBC chairman, Douglas Flint, who is to leave next year, described the first half a turbulent period during which the vote for Brexit had sparked \u201cexceptional volatility\u201d in markets. \u201cNow is a time for calm consideration of all the issues at hand and careful assessment of how prosperity, growth and a dynamic economy for both the UK and the rest of Europe can be ensured following an orderly transition period,\u201d he said. \u201cCritical elements include securing the best possible outcome on continuing terms of trade and market access, and ensuring the UK remains attractive for inward investment and has access to all the skills necessary to be fully competitive.\u201d He urged regulators not to force banks to hold more capital which might restrict lending and \u201clean against the increased public policy emphasis on stimulating economic growth at the time of elevated uncertainties\u201d. Before the EU referendum Gulliver said 1,000 UK roles may need to be moved to France and that \u201cit is still too early to tell which parts may be impacted and to what extent\u201d. The decision last year to keep its head office in the UK would not be affected. Amid expectations that the Bank of England could cut rates from 0.5% on Thursday, Gulliver played down any idea HSBC would copy Royal Bank of Scotland in writing to UK business customers to warn it may charge for holding deposits. But, he said, if rates did turn negative, they would probably be passed on to banks and hedge funds, as is the case in currencies where rates were negative. Retail customers were not affected. A cut to 0.25% would cost HSBC $100m in the coming six months. A year ago, Gulliver announced plans to axe 25,000 roles around the world, cutting costs and slimming down global ambitions from 88 countries to 71. The bank is \u201cpivoting\u201d towards Asia but keeping a focus on the UK and the US The interim dividend was increased by 3% to 0.31 cents a share.",

      "bodyText": "The FTSE 100 index has closed 11 points lower at 6634.40, a 0.17% fall. Banking shares had a better day, recouping some of the losses suffered over the past two days. HSBC closed nearly 5% higher at 504.4p, the biggest gainer, followed by Standard Chartered, up 4.2% at 614.3p. Royal Bank of Scotland and Barclays were also among the top risers, gaining 2.6% and 1.6% respectively. The Dax in Frankfurt rose 0.26% to 10,170.21 while the CAC in Paris slipped 0.16% to 4321.08.

In the US, the Dow Jones is trading 0.13% higher at 18,338.15 while the wider S&amp;P 500 is up just 0.09% at 2159 and the Nasdaw is also flat at 4718.85. Thank you for all your great comments. We will be back tomorrow. Good-bye! It\u2019s been another day in the red for European markets, despite all the hype surrounding \u2018Super Thursday\u2019 when the Bank of England is widely expected to cut interest rates for the first time since early 2009, taking borrowing costs to a new record low. Josh Mahony, market analyst at online trading firm IG, said: Much of the market reaction following June\u2019s referendum result have been somewhat surprising, with record highs in the US, the FTSE 250 reaching pre-referendum levels and now a sharp downturn in European stocks in the same week that both the RBA and BoE are likely to have ease monetary policy. The threat is that any rate cut is already priced in to markets and as such Carney &amp; co will have to do more than simply a 25 basis points cut to get any positive response from markets tomorrow. Today\u2019s survey data has confirmed the likelihood of a recession in the UK, with a sharp deterioration in the dominant services sector pointing towards a significant slowdown in hiring, business investment and ultimately economic growth. The manufacturing and construction industries have also weakened, according to equivalent surveys out earlier this week. The data from the US was more mixed today, with improvements in the jobs market on the one hand and weakening growth in the services sector on the other. Friday\u2019s non-farm payrolls numbers should shed more light on the state of the US economy. Credit ratings agency Moody\u2019s has warned that Brexit will have a negative effect on the UK\u2019s commercial property market, forecasting price falls of up to 10%. However, any price falls would be smaller than those seen during the global financial crisis. Moody\u2019s said: If London were to lose its \u201csafe haven\u201d status with foreign investors, it is likely that transaction volumes as well as property values would fall. Over the last two years, foreign direct investment has accounted for over two-thirds of all commercial real estate transactions in central London, with the remainder outside the city [according to CBRE data]. The office market in central London would be worst hit because that\u2019s where most financial and professional service firms are located. Demand for property would fall as firms would move some operations elsewhere in the EU, Moody\u2019s predicted. Developers Hammerson and Land Securities, which are major players in UK commercial property, are particularly at risk. Some of Britain\u2019s biggest food producers have issued a serious warning about home-grown fruit and veg following the Brexit vote. Damian Carrington reports: British fruit and vegetables would all but vanish from shops if Brexit means the foreign workers who pick virtually all the home-grown produce are no longer able to come to the UK, according to some of the country\u2019s biggest producers. They warn that the nation\u2019s food security would be damaged and that produce in UK shops would become more expensive if the freedom of movement for EU workers came to an end. They are urging ministers to set up a new permit scheme for seasonal workers. Without a scheme, they say production would move abroad, where many already have large operations, or would switch to cereals which are harvested by machines. The Brexit vote is already deterring foreign workers from coming to the UK, the producers report. About 90% of British fruit, vegetables and salads are picked, graded and packed by 60,000 to 70,000 workers from overseas, mostly from eastern Europe. Many of these work in areas which voted very strongly to leave the EU: the largely agricultural borough of Boston in Lincolnshire had the highest vote for leaving the EU in the whole country, at 75%. It\u2019s a pretty dull afternoon on the markets, ahead of the Bank of England\u2019s \u2018Super Thursday\u2019. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, has sent us his thoughts. Struggling for any direction that isn\u2019t its current glacial decline the Dow Jones was left wanting, the latest data-dump a decidedly mixed bag. The ADP non-farm employment change reading was better than expected at 179k against the 171k forecast; this number tends to have a rather tenuous link to the government-released non-farm figure, however, leaving it with a limited amount of market relevance. More important was the Markit and ISM services PMIs, yet even these left investors scratching their heads; the former jumped to a better than forecast 51.4, while the latter was far lower than expected, sliding to 55.5 from 56.5 last month. Unsurprisingly the Dow Jones couldn\u2019t find much clarity in these figures, rising a meagre 0.1% after the bell. Tomorrow, then, is the week\u2019s biggie: the first Bank of England \u2018Super Thursday\u2019 with a chance of actually living up to its normally sarcastic moniker. Following the string of ominous UK PMIs between Monday and Wednesday Mark Carney and co. are almost guaranteed to do something on Thursday \u2013 the big question is what? Consensus seems to suggest at the very least a rate cut to 0.25%, with some analysts suggesting it could go as low as 0.1%. The main uncertainty is over quantitative easing. A \u00a375bn extension to the pre-existing programme has been floated in certain quarters, though this is expected to be a more hotly debated issue in the MPC than the headline interest rate. Traditional logic would dictate that a rate cut alone should cause the FTSE to rise and the pound to fall; however, there is such an air of expectation around Thursday\u2019s meeting that a lack of QE (or something similar) may lead to disappointment for the former and relief for the latter. Sterling is steadying ahead of tomorrow\u2019s Bank of England decision, trading just off a three-week high against the dollar. Money markets are pricing in a quarter-point interest rate cut. Many economists are also expecting the central bank to announce other measures to stimulate the economy, for example through its quantitative easing (bond-buying) programme. The pound is holding above $1.33, down 0.25% against the dollar. Knight Frank\u2019s report also showed that rental transactions for upmarket homes in central London are up since the Brexit vote on 23 June, while rental prices have declined. The lettings market is actually stronger than last summer, thanks to the more \u201crealistic pricing\u201d. More sellers have become landlords due to uncertainty around price growth, the estate agent added. Tim Hyatt, head of lettings at Knight Frank, said: The current lettings market in prime central London is encouragingly stable. We saw a spike in new instructions in the aftermath of the referendum vote, although the number of new applicants registering is slightly down creating an imbalance of supply and demand. From a transaction perspective, the level of new deals has remained strong. In particular, the number of corporate enquiries was encouragingly positive as it was dramatically up on last year, highlighting that confidence in London as a capital city of choice remains strong. Due to the imbalance of supply and demand, landlords need to be realistic when it comes to pricing in an increasingly competitive market. This includes considering price reductions, however significant, in order to reflect value in the current climate. In central London, prices for luxury homes have fallen 1.5% in the year to July, according to upmarket estate agent Knight Frank. It says buyers are typically asking for 10% or more off the asking price. The firm said stamp duty was more of a concern than the recent Brexit vote in prime central London. Changes to the market over the last two years have meant that the Brexit vote has merely been a trigger for some to make overdue reductions to their asking price. It is too soon to say what impact Brexit will have on pricing but, in many cases, reductions reflect what would have been an appropriate price before the referendum. The number of viewings in June was 17% higher than a year earlier, and demand in areas such as Belgravia and Knightsbridge held up better than elsewhere. OIl prices have moved higher after their recent slide, with Brent crude \u2013 the global benchmark \u2013 up 1.4% at $42.38 a barrel and US West Texas Intermediate up 1.5% at $40.10. Prices were boosted after US government data showed a bigger-than-expected gasoline drawdown that offset a surprise build-up in crude stockpiles. US crude inventories rose by 1.4m barrels last week, while analysts had expected a fall of the same magnitude, the Energy Information Administration reported. At the same time, gasoline stocks slumped by 3.3m barrels, compared with forecasts of drop of 200,000 barrels. Concerns over a global oil glut persist, however. Output from the Opec cartel is near record levels. But markets prefer to look at the ISM services survey. Both surveys signal an easing in activity. A separate survey, from economic pollsters Markit, also showed that growth in the US service sector remained muted in July, with new business recording a slower increase. However, the rate of job creation picked up slightly and business confidence improved markedly after hitting a record low in June. The Markit US services index came in at 51.4 in July, unchanged from June, and above the 50 mark the divides expansion from contraction. The dollar is slipping against the yen and the euro on the data. US data just out: the closely watched ISM services/non-manufacturing index for July has come in at 55.5, slightly less than expected and down from 56.5 in June, signalling a slowdown. Employment in the services sector has weakened. US stock markets have opened and are broadly flat. The Dow Jones edged up nearly six points at the bell to 18,319.73 while the tech-heavy Nasdaq and the wider S&amp;P 500 were down slightly. Here\u2019s a quick round-up of today\u2019s corporate news: HSBC, Britain\u2019s biggest bank, has admitted a regulatory breach in the US as it unveiled a slump in first-half profits in what it termed \u201cturbulent\u201d markets, our City editor Jill Treanor reports.

Standard Chartered has been rooting out some of its clients as it cleans up its business in the wake of regulatory investigations, its chief executive has said as the emerging markets-focused bank returned to profit in the first half of 2016.

The boss of ad agency Saatchi &amp; Saatchi, Kevin Roberts, has resigned after provoking fury by claiming that women in the advertising industry lacked \u201cvertical ambition\u201d (he said they had \u201ccircular ambition\u201d). He was suspended at the weekend by Publicis, Saatchi\u2019s parent company, after denying that sexism was an issue in the advertising world. The boss of London housebuilder Berkeley Group, Tony Pidgley, made \u00a321.5m last year \u2013 despite a slight pay cut from \u00a323.3m the previous year.

The energy regulator, Ofgem, has promised to introduce next spring the first price controls for some customers since the domestic power sector was privatised more than 15 years ago. Full story by our energy editor, Terry Macalister, here. The Scotch whisky industry has warned of higher tariffs following the Brexit vote in June, and urged the UK government to push for favourable trade conditions after leaving the EU. David Frost, chief executive of the Scotch Whisky Association, said: We are calling on the UK government to bring clarity to the transition to Brexit as soon as possible and to negotiate to ensure that the current open trading environment is not affected. A cut in UK interest rates on Thursday will only have a short term impact, says Christopher Metcalfe at Newton Investment Management: Tomorrow the Bank of England is expected to announce the first interest rate reduction in more than seven years from its current record low of 0.5% to 0.25%. Given current market expectations, in such an event we would only expect a modest impact to sterling, FTSE and 10-year Gilts. A 25bp cut in the base rate will provide no more than a short-term sugar rush to the UK economy and the private sector will continue to be uncooperative. Unwilling or unable to take on the quantities of new debt necessary to overcome the structural headwinds facing the global economy, the response will continue to be the monetary policy equivalent of \u2018Can\u2019t Cook, Won\u2019t Cook\u2019. Price of credit for firms is already low and it is difficult to imagine if businesses are scared or unwilling to invest in the wake of Brexit at 50bp interest rates, whether a further to 25bp will induce them to invest. Our view continues to be that the deflationary pressures exerted by the burden of surplus debt, overcapacity across many industries, and technological disruption are too big in magnitude for monetary policy to counter. Given the private sector lacks the confidence and/or ability to increase credit by the required amount, the onus falls on the public sector. Lower interest rates mean lower margins for the banking sector. It is increasingly difficult for banks to make an attractive spread on deposits without taking large credit and/or deposit risk. This is the clear message from Europe\u2019s experiment with low interest thus far and continues to support our decision to hold zero banks within our Newton UK portfolios. Record-low interest rates and bond yields may validate continuing to pay higher prices for equities and other risk assets, continuing the hunt for yield and supporting safe haven assets. The housing market, particularly in the southeast of England has benefited from the availability of cheap finance. The search for yield and the decision to lower rates may support asset prices in the near-term. The good ADP jobs figures are not necessarily a good guide to Friday\u2019s non-farm payroll numbers. David Morrison, senior market strategist at Spreadco, said: [The ADP report] was good news as far as investors were concerned, but it doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that we\u2019re set for a strong Non-Farm Payroll number on Friday. Analysts are generally wary of taking the ADP data as a heads-up for Non-Farm Payrolls as the latter tends to be much more volatile than the ADP release. This has certainly been the case over the last few months. But the other issue is that the next Fed meeting isn\u2019t until 20/21st September. Not only will July\u2019s employment data be old news by then, but the market already doubts that the Fed will tighten monetary policy this year, let alone ahead of November\u2019s presidential Election. Ahead of the US non-farm payroll numbers comes a report showing private sector employers created more jobs than expected in July. The ADP report showed employment increased by 179,000 jobs last month compared to forecasts of a 170,000 rise. That compares to 176,000 in June, itself revised upwards from 172,000. Labour shadow chancellor John McDonnell has called for action from the government following the latest gloomy economic data: The economic outlook for the UK is uncertain, and it\u2019s time the Chancellor stepped up and told us what he is planning to do....We must rebalance our economy and support our key industries with an industrial strategy that can provide the good secure jobs that we so desperately need. Markets are currently mixed in the wake of the various PMI surveys. The FTSE 100 is now down 15 points or 0.2% while France\u2019s Cac has slipped 0.28%. But Germany\u2019s Dax has edged higher following its strong service sector performance, adding 0.1%. Meanwhile sterling is virtually flat against the dollar at $1.3355 and down 0.24% against the euro at \u20ac1.1926. Here is our report on the Markit surveys from economic editor Larry Elliott: The Bank of England has been provided with fresh evidence of the softness of the economy in the immediate post-Brexit period by a survey showing activity on course to decline by 0.4% in the third quarter of 2016. Ahead of Threadneedle Street\u2019s decision on whether to provide additional stimulus to boost growth, the Markit/CIPS snapshot of the services sector underlined the blow to output, orders and confidence delivered by the shock referendum result. The final purchasing managers index for services for July fell from 52.3 to 47.4 in June \u2013 the sharpest drop on record and in line with a flash estimate provided by Markit/CIPS just under two weeks ago. Live UK faces \u2018mild recession\u2019 as economy shrinks at fastest rate since 2009 - business live UK services sector contracts as Brexit concerns bite Read more A composite PMI \u2013 including manufacturing as well as services \u2013 showed a slightly bigger fall than first feared, declining from 52.5 to 47.5. Construction was not included in the original flash estimate of economic conditions in the aftermath of Brexit, but the all-sector PMI fell from 51.9 in June to 47.3 in July, its lowest level since the economy was in recession in April 2009. Any reading below 50 indicates that activity is contracting. The full report is here: Back with the European retail sales, and following recent weakness, they could pick up again as energy costs fall, says Peter Vanden Houte at ING Bank: Eurozone retail sales stabilized in June, though cheaper oil and stronger job creation should support consumption in the second half of the year. According to Eurostat figures released today, Eurozone retail sales stabilized in June, after a 0.4% expansion in May. This was in line with the consensus estimate. Portugal and Spain saw the highest increases (+3.1% and +1.0% MoM respectively), while Germany recorded a 0.1% fall and in France retail sales contracted 0.4% on the month. Year-on-year retail sales expanded by 1.6%. On average, retail sales grew 0.1% over the quarter after a 0.6% increase in the first quarter. The main culprit for the somewhat weaker consumption growth was most likely the 30% increase in oil prices over the quarter, sapping households\u2019 purchasing power. However, since July, energy prices have been weakening again, while July\u2019s PMIs are also showing that job creation remains strong in the Eurozone. Even though Brexit might have a minor adverse impact on consumer confidence, we believe that the underlying fundamentals remain strong enough to support consumption in the second half of the year. That said, we don\u2019t see any strengthening of the expansion in the near future with GDP growth likely to hover around 0.2% over the next few quarters, resulting in a 1.5% expansion for the whole of the year. More from Markit on the UK economy as evidenced from its latest surveys: Retail sales in the eurozone were stable in June, ahead of the UK\u2019s referendum, compared with the previous month. In the wider European Union they declined by 0.2%. In May there was an increase in both areas of 0.4%. Meanwhile the year on year figure rose by 1.6% in the euro area and by 2.4% in the wider EU. Even without a recession, the UK faces a period of lacklustre growth, says Dean Turner, economist at UBS Wealth Management: Off the back of equally disappointing manufacturing figures, today\u2019s numbers confirm that the UK economy is slowing. Although not currently our base case, if current levels for the PMIs are sustained, we may need to brace ourselves for a mild recession by the end of the year. Today\u2019s confirmation of the downturn in the Services PMI should not be underestimated, with significant near-term implications for UK businesses. But until the fog of Brexit begins to clear, it is frankly too early to tell whether the latest string of disappointing data is a real cause for concern. Time will tell if a recession is on the cards but it is clear we now face a period of lacklustre growth, a sharp contrast to the above trend growth we\u2019ve enjoyed for the last three years. These figures support speculation that we will see an interest rate cut tomorrow. We expect the Bank of England to cut rates by at least 25 basis points, reopen QE, and potentially discuss other easing measures. But: The Bank of England is now likely to cut interest rates following this latest survey evidence, agrees David Morrison, senior market strategist at Spreadco: This was the last piece of major UK data ahead on tomorrow\u2019s Bank of England rate decision. It provides more evidence (if any were needed) that the Bank will want to ease monetary policy further with the consensus view that it will cut its headline Bank Rate by 25 basis points. There\u2019s also an expectation that the Bank will restart its asset purchases. However, there are a range of views here with estimates for additional stimulus ranging from \u00a350 \u2013 175 billion. The chances of the UK sliding into recession have increased, says Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit, and an interest rate cut on Thursday now seems \u201ca foregone conclusion.\u201d He says: The marked service sector downturn follows news from sister PMI surveys showing construction activity suffering its steepest decline since mid- 2009 and manufacturing output contracting at the fastest rate since late-2012. At these levels, the PMI data are collectively signalling a 0.4% quarterly rate of decline of GDP. It\u2019s too early to say if the surveys will remain in such weak territory in coming months, leaving substantial uncertainty over the extent of any potential downturn. However, the unprecedented month-on-month drop in the all-sector index has undoubtedly increased the chances of the UK sliding into at least a mild recession. Services providers are certainly bracing themselves for worse to come, with a record drop in business confidence about the year ahead leaving optimism at its lowest ebb since February 2009. However, the extent of any downturn clearly depends to some degree on the policy response. The PMI is already deep into territory which would normally spur the Bank of England into taking action to stimulate the economy. A quarter-point cut in interest rates therefore seems to be a foregone conclusion at tomorrow\u2019s Monetary Policy Committee meeting, though the extent and nature of other non-standard stimulus measures remains a far greater source of uncertainty and the subject of intense speculation. The fall in the UK all sector index from 51.9 to 47.3 in July was the biggest one month drop in the 20 year history of the survey. Ahead of Thursday\u2019s Bank of England meeting, the UK economy has been confirmed as slowing at its fastest rate since the financial crisis following the Brexit vote. The final reading of the UK services PMI for July came in at 47.4, down from 52.3 in June and in line with the flash reading two weeks ago. The all-sector index of services and manufacturing (as well as construction) was lower than the initial estimate, down from 51.9 in June to 47.3 and marking the lowest level since April 2009. The flash estimate was 47.7. Away from the service sector surveys for a moment, and here\u2019s our report on the update from retailer Next: Next has warned that trading will be difficult for the rest of this year because of weak consumer demand for clothing but the retailer predicted its annual profit would be higher than expected. In a trading update, Next said full-price sales rose 0.3% in the second quarter of its financial year, an improvement on the 0.9% fall in the first quarter. Sales will fall again in the third quarter compared with what was Next\u2019s best trading period last year. If the winter is cold, fourth quarter sales could grow compared with a year earlier, when warm weather and lack of stock depressed sales, the group said. \u201cTrading remains extremely volatile and on a week-by-week basis is highly dependent on the weather. This volatility is indicative of the underlying weakness of consumer demand for clothing \u2026 We expect the consumer environment to remain tough for the rest of the year.\u201d The full story is here: Lifted by a strong performance from Germany, offsetting continuing stagnation in France and a slowdown in Italy and Spain, eurozone business activity edged higher in July. Markit\u2019s eurozone composite PMI rose from 53.1 in June to 53.2, higher than the initial reading of 52.9. The services PMI came in at 52.9 in July, up from 52.8 and better than the flash estimate of 52.7. Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit said: A welcome uptick in the final PMI numbers presents a slightly better picture than the slowing signalled by the earlier flash reading, and is especially encouraging as it suggests the region saw little overall contagion from the UK\u2019s \u2018Brexit\u2019 vote. However, the survey is still indicating only a modest 0.3% quarterly rate of economic growth at the start of the third quarter. Such a meagre pace of expansion will inevitably fuel speculation about what the ECB could and should do to boost growth, and when. The upturn is being led by surging growth in Germany, where a 0.5% pace of expansion is being signalled. However, France continued to stagnate, acting as a significant drag on the region. Growth has also slowed in Spain and Italy, in both cases indicating that political uncertainty is hurting businesses. While the pace of expansion in Spain has merely slowed to around 0.6% in July, Italy is growing at a sluggish 0.2% pace. Greater comfort can be gained from the upturn in employment growth to a pace which has not been exceeded since February 2008. The improved hiring trend suggests firms have gained sufficient confidence in the durability and sustainability of the upturn to expand capacity in increasing numbers. However, if growth in Spain and Italy continues to weaken, this impressive hiring trend will inevitably come under pressure. Germany\u2019s business activity grew at its highest pace this year, boosted by strong growth in the services sector, but there were some concerns about the impact of the UK\u2019s vote to leave the European Union. Markit\u2019s composote purchasing managers\u2019 index - which includes both services and manufacturing - rose to 55.3 in July from 54.4 the previous month, unchanged from the initial estimate. The service sector PMI increased from 53.7 in June to a two month high of 54.4. Markit economist Oliver Kolodseike said: Germany\u2019s service sector continued to grow at the start of the third quarter, with the underlying trend pace broadly in line with that seen over the past three years. But he said positive sentiment fell to an eight month low as companies expressed concern about the Brexit vote. France\u2019s service sector returned to growth in July, with a better than expected performance. The Markit services PMI came in at 50.5 from 49.9 in June and better than the intial reading of 50.3 for the month. Anything above 50 signals expansion.historically muted level. Manufacturing continued to be weak, but with the strength in services, the composite index of both sectors rose from 49.6 in June to 50.1, marginally better than the initial reading of 50.0. Jack Kennedy, senior economist at Markit, said: The service sector returned to growth at the start of the third quarter, compensating for ongoing manufacturing weakness and leaving overall private sector activity broadly flat on the month. There were slight increases in new business and employment evident in the latest survey data, but overall little sign of any change to the subdued pattern seen throughout the year to date. Indeed companies\u2019 business expectations remain at a But the composite figure for Italy, comprising both services and manufacturing, has slipped back in July and suggests weak third quarter GDP growth: And they are coming thick and fast now. Italy\u2019s service sector has grown more strongly than expected in July: Spain\u2019s service sector growth has come in below expectations, falling to its lowest level since February. Which has helped pull down the composite index of both services and manufacturing: Not everyone believes the Bank of England should cut interest rates on Thursday, despite its hints last month that a move in August was on the cards unless the UK economy improved. If central banks are running out of ammunition, the argument goes, then perhaps Bank governor Mark Carney and the rest of the monetary policy committee should wait for more evidence of the fallout from Brexit before using up what they have left in the locker. And if the government decides to unveil fiscal measures to help boost the economy, that will not happen until September. So perhaps the Bank should wait until then to see what new chancellor Philip Hammond has up his sleeve. China\u2019s service sector slowed in July but a rebound in manufacturing has pushed the composite index - which covers both sectors - to its highest since September 2014. The Caixin services index fell from an 11-month high of 52.7 in June to 51.7, but the composite index for July was 51.9, up 1.6 points from June\u2019s reading. Caixin said: The renewed upswing in overall growth momentum was partly driven by the first increase in manufacturing output for four months, while services activity continued to expand in July. That said, the rate of services activity growth slowed since June and was moderate overall. [For services] all of the index categories showed signs of deterioration, with employment falling back into the territory of contraction after three consecutive months of growth. Implementation of supportive measures including proactive fiscal policies must continue to protect the recovery, and regulations in the services sector should be further relaxed. It\u2019s an uncertain start but a marginally positive one for Europe\u2019s stock markets. The FTSE 100 is up 24 points or 0.38%, helped by a 4% rise in Next following its latest trading statement and a more than 3% jump in HSBC shares after its results. Elsewhere Germany\u2019s Dax opened up 0.1%, France\u2019s Cac 0.4% higher and Spain\u2019s Ibex 0.5% ahead. Ahead of the UK service sector figures: HSBC could provide a little light in the gloom of the banking sector following its results. Yes, first half profits fell by 29% but news of a \u00a31.8bn buyback is expected to give some support to its shares. In Hong Kong its shares erased early losses to climb 0.2%, which traders hope will be followed through in London. The banking sector has been under pressure in recent days, following the results of the European stress tests on Friday and continuing concerns about the effect of low - and in some cases negative - interest rates on their balance sheets. Not to mention non-performing loans of course, with Italian banks a particular problem. Even the stress test results themselves have left analysts unconvinced of their merits. CMC\u2019s Michael Hewson again: If last week\u2019s European bank stress tests were designed to bolster confidence in the European banking sector it is becoming quite clear that they have failed abysmally. Far from boosting confidence they appear to have helped undermine it by focussing attention on what wasn\u2019t tested, as opposed to what was. The omission of Portuguese and Greek bank from the tests as well as the failure to test resilience against a prolonged period of negative rates has left investors to draw their own conclusions, and Commerzbank\u2019s decision yesterday to scrap its profit target for the year in the wake of 32% drop in quarterly profits, merely served to reinforce those fears sending its share price to new record lows, along with its sector peer Deutsche Bank, who suffered the ignominy of being relegated out of the EurStoxx50 in a clear sign of how far the shares have fallen. Italian banking shares also resumed their downward track despite Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi\u2019s attempts to calm nerves by claiming that Italian banks were fine by claiming that growth would be the best way to resolve the non-peforming loan problem. Unfortunately for Mr Renzi the Italian economy hasn\u2019t grown in any significant way since it joined the euro which suggests that for all his warm words the reality has been somewhat different, and isn\u2019t likely to change any time soon, and that is likely to be his biggest challenge. Monte dei Paschi led the declines crashing to new record lows and weighing down the rest of the sector as doubts grew about the prospect of the ability of the Italian banking sector to absorb further write downs across the rest of the sector. Asian markets have fallen back, with concerns about a global slowdown, the weak oil price and the banking sector, not to mention disappointment with recent action from central banks. The Nikkei 225 is down 1.88% while the Hang Seng is 2.64% lower. So we can look forward to a mixed opening in Europe: Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. After Monday\u2019s global manufacturing figures for July - a mixed picture on the whole - come the service sector numbers. In particular focus will be the UK number, as it comes just a day ahead of the Bank of England\u2019s latest interest rate decision. As with manufacturing, a snapshot two weeks ago showed a sharp downturn in the wake of Brexit, with the index down from 52.3 in June to 47.4 in July, an 88 month low. There is an outside chance this will be revised upwards but analysts are not holding their breath. Even if the figure is better than the initial estimate, most economists are betting the economy is weak enough to justify the Bank cutting rates on Thursday, with perhaps an extra package of stimulus to give another boost to business. But some believe central bankers are running out of ammunition. A rate cut by the Reserve Bank of Australia and a Japanese stimulus package, both on Tuesday, did little to boost market sentiment. Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK, said: The larger concern here given recent market reaction to policy moves by central bankers is that policymakers are losing the confidence of investors. Investors are slowly realising that with every spin of the central bank policy chamber the magazine is getting emptier, and in the absence of any will or ability of politicians to step up, central bank policy will continue to move into the realms of the more experimental with every passing day. Of course, the UK is not alone in reporting service sector data. Here\u2019s the European agenda: And around 3pm BST come the US figures.",

The ADP non-farm employment change reading was better than expected at 179k against the 171k forecast; this number tends to have a rather tenuous link to the government-released non-farm figure, however, leaving it with a limited amount of market relevance. More important was the Markit and ISM services PMIs, yet even these left investors scratching their heads; the former jumped to a better than forecast 51.4, while the latter was far lower than expected, sliding to 55.5 from 56.5 last month.

Traditional logic would dictate that a rate cut alone should cause the FTSE to rise and the pound to fall; however, there is such an air of expectation around Thursday\u2019s meeting that a lack of QE (or something similar) may lead to disappointment for the former and relief for the latter.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57a20546e4b09f60c88cc7a7\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-08-03T14:57:14.229Z\">3.57pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Sterling is steadying ahead of tomorrow\u2019s Bank of England decision, trading just off a three-week high against the dollar.

Given current market expectations, in such an event we would only expect a modest impact to sterling, FTSE and 10-year Gilts.</p> <p>A 25bp cut in the base rate will provide no more than a short-term sugar rush to the UK economy and the private sector will continue to be uncooperative. Unwilling or unable to take on the quantities of new debt necessary to overcome the structural headwinds facing the global economy, the response will continue to be the monetary policy equivalent of \u2018Can\u2019t Cook, Won\u2019t Cook\u2019.</p> <p>Price of credit for firms is already low and it is difficult to imagine if businesses are scared or unwilling to invest in the wake of Brexit at 50bp interest rates, whether a further to 25bp will induce them to invest. Our view continues to be that the deflationary pressures exerted by the burden of surplus debt, overcapacity across many industries, and technological disruption are too big in magnitude for monetary policy to counter. Given the private sector lacks the confidence and/or ability to increase credit by the required amount, the onus falls on the public sector.</p> <p>Lower interest rates mean lower margins for the banking sector. It is increasingly difficult for banks to make an attractive spread on deposits without taking large credit and/or deposit risk. This is the clear message from Europe\u2019s experiment with low interest thus far and continues to support our decision to hold zero banks within our Newton UK portfolios.</p> <p>Record-low interest rates and bond yields may validate continuing to pay higher prices for equities and other risk assets, continuing the hunt for yield and supporting safe haven assets. The housing market, particularly in the southeast of England has benefited from the availability of cheap finance. The search for yield and the decision to lower rates may support asset prices in the near-term.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57a1e686e4b053ab6456b2fb\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-08-03T12:43:32.041Z\">1.43pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The good ADP jobs figures are not necessarily a good guide to Friday\u2019s non-farm payroll numbers.

This was in line with the consensus estimate. Portugal and Spain saw the highest increases (+3.1% and +1.0% MoM respectively), while Germany recorded a 0.1% fall and in France retail sales contracted 0.4% on the month. Year-on-year retail sales expanded by 1.6%.</p> <p>On average, retail sales grew 0.1% over the quarter after a 0.6% increase in the first quarter. The main culprit for the somewhat weaker consumption growth was most likely the 30% increase in oil prices over the quarter, sapping households\u2019 purchasing power.</p> <p>However, since July, energy prices have been weakening again, while July\u2019s PMIs are also showing that job creation remains strong in the Eurozone. Even though Brexit might have a minor adverse impact on consumer confidence, we believe that the underlying fundamentals remain strong enough to support consumption in the second half of the year. That said, we don\u2019t see any strengthening of the expansion in the near future with GDP growth likely to hover around 0.2% over the next few quarters, resulting in a 1.5% expansion for the whole of the year.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57a1b865e4b07e27cb7e05d5\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-08-03T09:25:21.296Z\">10.25am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>More from Markit on the UK economy as evidenced from its latest surveys:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/WilliamsonChris/status/760767049752862720\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">PMI shows UK business costs rising due to weaker \u00a3 but selling price inflation unchanged.

The PMI is already deep into territory which would normally spur the Bank of England into taking action to stimulate the economy.

As with manufacturing, a snapshot two weeks ago showed a sharp downturn in the wake of Brexit, with <strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jul/22/britains-economy-shrinking-at-fastest-rate-since-2009-says-survey\">the index down from 52.3 in June to 47.4 in July, an 88 month low. </a></strong><br></p> <p>There is an outside chance this will be revised upwards but analysts are not holding their breath. Even if the figure is better than the initial estimate, most economists are betting the economy is weak enough to justify the Bank cutting rates on Thursday, with perhaps an extra package of stimulus to give another boost to business. But some believe central bankers are running out of ammunition. A rate cut by the Reserve Bank of Australia and a Japanese stimulus package, both on Tuesday, did little to boost market sentiment. Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The larger concern here given recent market reaction to policy moves by central bankers is that<strong> </strong>policymakers are losing the confidence of investors.</p> <p>Investors are slowly realising that with every spin of the central bank policy chamber the magazine is getting emptier, and in the absence of any will or ability of politicians to step up, central bank policy will continue to move into the realms of the more experimental with every passing day. </p> </blockquote> <p>Of course, the UK is not alone in reporting service sector data.

The deputy Labour leader has written to Theresa May following reports that the corporate registration agency is planning to erase vast amounts of public data, claiming the move would make a mockery of her pledge to tackle corporate irresponsibility and hinder businesses, journalists and the police in their efforts. The government agency maintains a database on all UK-incorporated firms, listing their accounts and all directors and shareholders. But proposals are being considered to reduce the amount of time the records of dissolved companies are retained \u2013 from 20 years to six \u2013 raising fears it will hamper investigations into white collar criminals and money laundering. On Wednesday, Watson added his voice to those who have already expressed concern. \u201cYou have said that you want to tackle corporate irresponsibility, reform capitalism \u2018so that it works for everyone rather than for a privileged few\u2019,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThis proposal from Companies House would only serve to protect criminals who seek to hide their past corporate misdeeds from public view. It would harm the global fight against corruption and tax avoidance. It would also be an attack on the right of the public, the police and journalists to scrutinise corporate wrongdoing. Perhaps more importantly, it would prohibit legitimate companies carrying out due diligence on people they are considering doing business with.\u201d Police investigators, the National Crime Agency, the Serious Fraud Office, lawyers, journalists and bank compliance teams all make extensive use of the data, often searching for dissolved companies and their directors. In June last year, the previously paid-for information was made available free to the general public, leading to a surge in the number of searches. Companies House said this led to complaints that retaining and providing access to long-dissolved firms is inconsistent with data protection law. It says the source of the complaints were members of the public, but there have been reports suggesting some MPs have also been protesting. Watson wrote: \u201cIt seems inconceivable for a government that claims it wants to be the most transparent in the world to place such a damaging restriction on these rights ... It has been reported that MPs have lobbied Companies House to reduce the length of time this records have to be held. I would like to know which MPs have been demanding these changes, and what their reasons are for doing so.\u201d Searches for information on Companies House\u2019s website are running at 2m a day. Data protection law does not specify a time limit for records to be kept, but business people linked to dissolved companies have been citing the legislation when arguing for a shorter retention period. The Tax Justice Network and the Opencorporates group are among those who have previously criticised the proposals which, if put in place today, would have prevented access to information on Dominic Chappell, the director who was running the BHS department store chain when it collapsed and who has been declared bankrupt three times. Watson said: \u201cI have written to Theresa May to seek assurance that this proposal from the Cameron and Osborne era will not see the light of day.\u201d",

    "webTitle": "Pre-payment meter price cap is watershed moment, says Ofgem", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The energy regulator, Ofgem, has promised to introduce price controls for customers on pre-payment meters next spring \u2013 the first since the domestic power sector was privatised more than 15 years ago. It described the move as a watershed moment. A database allowing rival suppliers to offer better deals to those on standard variable rates will also be introduced. But opposition MPs, independent providers and others said Ofgem\u2019s initiatives, which follow up recommendations from the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA), were far too little too late. Ofgem\u2019s chief executive, Dermot Nolan said the shakeup would loosen the grip of the big six suppliers, which control more than 85% of the market. Nolan said: \u201cThe CMA\u2019s final report is a watershed moment for industry and consumers and points the way to a fairer and more competitive future. I call on energy companies and consumer groups to seize this opportunity.\u201d The price cap will help the \u201cmost vulnerable and least likely to switch\u201d and will save them around \u00a375 a year from next April, he added. The controls will last until at least 2020 when the introduction of smart meters could eradicate overcharging in that part of the market. The CMA investigated the wider energy market after an outcry over soaring power bills. The Labour party had threatened to freeze all bills if elected in 2015 and the shadow energy secretary, Barry Gardiner, was scathing about Ofgem\u2019s proposals and apparent government inaction. \u201cThe Tories have sat back and done nothing while Ofgem is failing in its duty as the regulator,\u201d Gardiner said. \u201cI challenge Ofgem\u2019s chief exec, Dermot Nolan, to name any other purchase where consumers are being swindled out of \u00a31.9m a day and the regulator turns round and says: \u2018It\u2019s the customers\u2019 fault. They should switch to another supplier!\u2019 This is not regulation, it is aiding and abetting the offender.\u201d Ed Kamm, the UK managing director for First Utility, one of the largest independent suppliers, criticised the plans. He said the CMA\u2019s report rightly identified the problem that 70% of UK households were overpaying for their energy. He added: \u201cBut the [Ofgem] proposals put too much onus on the customer, don\u2019t go far enough and the timing of their implementation is baffling. Ofgem itself admits that consumers who are already engaged in the market will see the first benefits. \u201cWe are in real danger of continuing to fuel a \u2018tale of two markets\u2019 \u2013 helping those who already shop around and doing little to properly help those who are continuing to pay much more than they need to or should.\u201d Mark Todd, the co-founder of the switching service energyhelpline.com said customers on standard metre tariffs would remain \u201con square one\u201d. He added: \u201cAs is Ofgem\u2019s way, the onus still lies with the customer to be proactive and shop around to avoid being ripped off. Unfortunately, the average household only switches once every nine years, costing themselves roughly \u00a3300 a year or \u00a33,000 over a decade.\u201d Byron Orme, a research fellow at the Institute for Public Policy Research (IPPR), said Ofgem\u2019s move should be the beginning and not the end of a reform process, given that those on lower incomes and the over-65s were likely to remain disengaged and overcharged. Orme added: \u201cThe government has a continuing role to play in protecting the most vulnerable customers.

      "body": "<p><a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.ofgem.gov.uk/\">The energy regulator, Ofgem,</a> has promised to introduce price controls for customers on pre-payment meters next spring \u2013 the first since the domestic power sector was privatised more than 15 years ago.</p> <p>It described the move as a watershed moment. A database allowing rival suppliers to offer better deals to those on standard variable rates will also be introduced.</p> <p>But opposition MPs, independent providers and others said Ofgem\u2019s initiatives, which follow up <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/cma-publishes-final-energy-market-reforms\">recommendations from the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA)</a>, were far too little too late.</p> <p>Ofgem\u2019s chief executive, Dermot Nolan said the shakeup would loosen the grip of the big six suppliers, which control more than 85% of the market.</p> <p>Nolan said: \u201cThe CMA\u2019s final report is a watershed moment for industry and consumers and points the way to a fairer and more competitive future. I call on energy companies and consumer groups to seize this opportunity.\u201d</p> <p>The price cap will help the \u201cmost vulnerable and least likely to switch\u201d and will save them around \u00a375 a year from next April, he added. </p> <p>The controls will last until at least 2020 when the introduction of smart meters could eradicate overcharging in that part of the market. The CMA investigated the wider energy market after an outcry over soaring power bills. </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/sep/24/ed-miliband-labour-freeze-prices-2017\">The Labour party had threatened to freeze all bills if elected in 2015</a> and the shadow energy secretary, Barry Gardiner, was scathing about Ofgem\u2019s proposals and apparent government inaction.</p> <p>\u201cThe Tories have sat back and done nothing while Ofgem is failing in its duty as the regulator,\u201d Gardiner said. \u201cI challenge Ofgem\u2019s chief exec, Dermot Nolan, to name any other purchase where consumers are being swindled out of \u00a31.9m a day and the regulator turns round and says: \u2018It\u2019s the customers\u2019 fault. They should switch to another supplier!\u2019 This is not regulation, it is aiding and abetting the offender.\u201d</p> <p>Ed Kamm, the UK managing director for First Utility, one of the largest independent suppliers, criticised the plans. He said the CMA\u2019s report rightly identified the problem that 70% of UK households were overpaying for their energy.</p> <p>He added: \u201cBut the [Ofgem] proposals put too much onus on the customer, don\u2019t go far enough and the timing of their implementation is baffling. Ofgem itself admits that consumers who are already engaged in the market will see the first benefits.</p> <p>\u201cWe are in real danger of continuing to fuel a \u2018tale of two markets\u2019 \u2013 helping those who already shop around and doing little to properly help those who are continuing to pay much more than they need to or should.\u201d</p> <p>Mark Todd, the co-founder of the switching service energyhelpline.com said customers on standard metre tariffs would remain \u201con square one\u201d. </p> <p>He added: \u201cAs is Ofgem\u2019s way, the onus still lies with the customer to be proactive and shop around to avoid being ripped off. Unfortunately, the average household only switches once every nine years, costing themselves roughly \u00a3300 a year or \u00a33,000 over a decade.\u201d</p> <p>Byron Orme, a research fellow at the Institute for Public Policy Research (IPPR), said Ofgem\u2019s move<em tabindex=\"-1\"><em tabindex=\"-1\"> s</em></em>hould be the beginning and not the end of a reform process, given that those on lower incomes and the over-65s were likely to remain disengaged and overcharged.</p> <p>Orme added: \u201cThe government has a continuing role to play in protecting the most vulnerable customers. Action must continue beyond these reforms to include measures that materially reduce people\u2019s bills. By far the best way to achieve this is through investment in energy efficiency improvements to ensure that costs are brought down and kept down.\u201d<br></p> <p>Meanwhile, the green energy company Ecotricity pledged to resist Ofgem\u2019s efforts to force suppliers to share customer data with the entire energy market.</p> <p>Dale Vince, Ecotricity\u2019s founder, said: \u201cAfter two years of deliberations the proposals from CMA are a massive disappointment. </p> <p>\u201cThey ducked the one big issue before them: cracking down on the abuse of the 70% of households who have never switched supplier and are subject to price gouging, where energy companies offer loss-leading tariffs to attract new customers and use longstanding customers to pay for them.</p> <p>\u201cInstead they have opted to create a new abuse: sharing of everyone\u2019s personal data with every energy company in the land, which is likely to create a blizzard of junk mail.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "The founder and chairman of housebuilder Berkeley Group took a paycut last year but still received a remuneration package of \u00a321.5m. Tony Pidgley\u2019s package was down from \u00a323.3m the previous year, according to the company\u2019s annual report (pdf), partly because half his bonus was deferred under the company\u2019s new plan. His cash bonus almost halved to \u00a31.3m last year, from \u00a32.5m the previous year. Most of Pidgley\u2019s remuneration package was made up of options granted in 2009, when the industry was mired in a downturn following the global financial crisis. The options were granted at \u00a33.06 a share but vested at \u00a328.50, resulting in a \u00a319.2m gain for Pidgley. The previous year, he received \u00a319.8m from the 2009 incentive plan. Often described as Britain\u2019s most influential housebuilder, Pidgley was adopted by travellers at four and left school at 15 to form his own haulage company. He sold it at 20 and formed Berkeley Group seven years later, floating the building firm on the stock market in 1985. A Berkeley spokesman said last year marked the last payout under the 2009 incentive plan, adding : \u201cThese share awards were designed in 2009, when the share price was \u00a37.98, to encourage long-term value creation and long-term share price growth. Since then, the company has consistently outperformed the market, returning the highest return on equity in the industry every year for the last seven years.\u201d He also noted that Berkeley, which specialises in building upmarket homes in London, does not benefit from the government\u2019s help-to-buy programme. Pidgley\u2019s salary increased to \u00a3850,000 last year, up from \u00a3825,000 in 2014-15, and rises further to \u00a3875,000 this financial year. The second best-paid executive at the company is its managing director, Rob Perrins, who received total remuneration of almost \u00a311m last year, including \u00a39.6m from the 2009 incentive plan. His annual cash bonus fell from \u00a31.5m to \u00a3773,000, as half was deferred. Perrins\u2019s salary went up to \u00a3515,000, from \u00a3500,000, and increases to \u00a3530,000 this year. Shares in the company, which slipped 10p, or 0.4%, to \u00a325.89 on Wednesday, have lost nearly 30% of their value this year owing to concerns about the impact of the Brexit vote on the London property market.",

Look, I\u2019m in a bit of a hurry, so if \u2026 Self-service checkouts were first installed in an upstate New York supermarket in 1992. It\u2019s a sort of unmanned till with an irritating robot voice. Thanks for that. Now if you wouldn\u2019t mind, I\u2019m \u2026 Unexpected item in bagging area. Yes, that\u2019s the tin of chick peas I just scanned. It looks like a bottle of vodka. Maybe it\u2019s because I\u2019m using my own bag, but I swear \u2026 Please wait for a member of staff to assist you. Are you accusing me of stealing? No, but the University of Leicester is. A new report from its Department of Criminology suggests that self-checkout technology encourages even normally honest shoppers to commit theft. How? Some of it\u2019s accidental \u2013 people forget to scan items, or get confused by instructions. That\u2019s not stealing. Other times shoppers get so frustrated with self-service kiosks that they feel justified in not paying. If the machine is messing you about, what else can you do? I have places to be! But mostly people shoplift because the technology makes it so easy. You know what? I think the supermarkets want you to steal. I doubt that. The report found that installing self-service checkouts raises lost revenue by 122%. Really? Mobile phone scanning technology is just as vulnerable \u2013 the study found that at the end of a typical shopping trip, up to 10% of items had not been scanned, leading to \u201cshrinkage\u201d (loss through wastage or theft) of about 3.9% of turnover. Yes, but they\u2019re also saving money by making me do all the work for them. This free box of Shreddies is basically my salary. That\u2019s a flatscreen TV. It\u2019s not my fault I couldn\u2019t lift it on to the scanner! Arrest me! Unfortunately the technology makes it very difficult to prove that customers are deliberately stealing. One retailer admitted they almost never prosecute people. In which case, I\u2019ll take my Shreddies and be on my way. For that reason supermarkets are now introducing tagging systems so unscanned items trigger alarms. Ah, do you have that here? Maybe. Do say: \u201cThank you. Please accept this voucher for \u00a310 off your next shoplift.\u201d Don\u2019t say: \u201cInsert your Nectar card, and then turn to face the Taser.\u201d",

It\u2019s a sort of unmanned till with an irritating robot voice.</p> <p><strong>Thanks for that. Now if you wouldn\u2019t mind, I\u2019m \u2026</strong> Unexpected item in bagging area.</p> <p><strong>Yes, that\u2019s the tin of chick peas I just scanned.</strong> It looks like a bottle of vodka.</p> <p><strong>Maybe it\u2019s because I\u2019m using my own bag, but I swear \u2026 </strong>Please wait for a member of staff to assist you.</p> <p><strong>Are you accusing me of stealing? </strong>No, but the University of Leicester is. A new report from its Department of Criminology suggests that self-checkout technology encourages even normally honest shoppers to commit theft.</p> <p><strong>How? </strong>Some of it\u2019s accidental \u2013 people forget to scan items, or get confused by instructions.</p> <p><strong>That\u2019s not stealing.</strong> Other times shoppers get so frustrated with self-service kiosks that they feel justified in not paying.</p> <p><strong>If the machine is messing you about, what else can you do? I have places to be!</strong> But mostly people shoplift because the technology makes it so easy.</p> <p><strong>You know what? I think the supermarkets want you to steal. </strong>I doubt that. The report found that installing self-service checkouts raises lost revenue by 122%.</p> <p><strong>Really? </strong>Mobile phone scanning technology is just as vulnerable \u2013 the study found that at the end of a typical shopping trip, up to 10% of items had not been scanned, leading to \u201cshrinkage\u201d (loss through wastage or theft) of about 3.9% of turnover.</p> <p><strong>Yes, but they\u2019re also saving money by making me do all the work for them. This free box of Shreddies is basically my salary. </strong>That\u2019s a flatscreen TV.</p> <p><strong>It\u2019s not my fault I couldn\u2019t lift it on to the scanner! Arrest me!</strong> Unfortunately the technology makes it very difficult to prove that customers are deliberately stealing. One retailer admitted they almost never prosecute people.</p> <p><strong>In which case, I\u2019ll take my Shreddies and be on my way.</strong> For that reason supermarkets are now introducing tagging systems so unscanned items trigger alarms.</p> <p><strong>Ah, do you have that here?</strong> Maybe.</p> <p><strong>Do say:</strong> \u201cThank you. Please accept this voucher for \u00a310 off your next shoplift.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Don\u2019t say:</strong> \u201cInsert your Nectar card, and then turn to face the Taser.\u201d</p>",

The bank\u2019s shares, which earlier in the year were driven to 25-year lows on concerns about the global economy, jumped 10% even as Winters admitted he needed to delay his targets for returns to shareholders.

Half-year profits stood at $893m, down on $2bn a year earlier, but it was a relief to investors after the full-year loss, the first since 1989. \u201cConduct in the banking industry continues to be under scrutiny.

But, he added, there would alway be \u201cbad eggs\u201d. Winters blamed a downturn in global growth as he removed the timescale to achieve targets set only in November, when the bank tapped shareholders for \u00a33.3bn and said 15,000 jobs would be cut. The return on equity targets of 8% by 2018 and 10% by 2020 no longer look achievable.",

      "bodyText": "The boss of the high street chain Next has said its clothing prices could rise by up to 5% next year after the pound collapsed in the wake of the Brexit vote. Lord Wolfson said the cost of buying goods from abroad in sterling had jumped by 9% for next year\u2019s fashions but that some of that hit would be mitigated as other currencies, such as the yuan, had also weakened against the dollar and it would also be able to secure better deals from suppliers. \u201cWe\u2019ve always taken the view that if our costs go up then our selling prices will go up and vice versa,\u201d Wolfson said. \u201cAlthough it is very early in the buying cycle, we currently estimate that cost prices in 2017/18 will rise by less than 5% on like-for-like products.\u201d Wolfson promised to give more details at its half-year results update next month as it would have \u201cgreater visibility\u201d of the retailer\u2019s spring and summer contracts. The warning on prices came as Wolfson said trading would remain tough this year. In March, he predicted 2016 would be the most difficult since the financial crisis, pointing to weak consumer confidence and the trend for people spending spare cash on eating out and other leisure experiences rather than new clothes. The Conservative peer, a prominent Vote Leave supporter, said he did not expect Thursday\u2019s expected interest rate cut to make much difference to the UK\u2019s cooling economy as the base rate was already so low. The government could, however, boost the economy by tackling his b\u00eate noire, the country\u2019s \u201cslow\u201d planning system, he said. The decision to delay the Hinkley Point nuclear plant had been a \u201csensible\u201d one, he added, suggesting that investment in roads and aviation capacity, as well as energy reform, would be more productive. In its trading update, the retailer said full-price sales edged up 0.3% in the three months to 30 July, an improvement on the 0.9% fall in the first quarter. The sales picture was \u201cextremely volatile\u201d, with big swings dictated by the weather rather than political upheaval as Britons bought summer clothes during shortlived hot spells. \u201cThe market is being driven by need,\u201d said Wolfson. \u201cIf the sun comes out and you need summer clothes, people are buying them. This volatility is indicative of the underlying weakness of consumer demand for clothing.\u201d Nicla di Palma, analyst at Brewin Dolphin, said: \u201cWe do not think Next will be able to increase its selling prices due to the competitive situation in the UK clothing market and the weakness of the UK consumer. These results are reassuring, although there remains a big question mark on the strength of the consumer in the next few months.\u201d Next has cut its guidance for annual profit twice this year, blaming consumer caution, less enthusiasm for clothes shopping and bad weather in early spring. The outlook improved during the quarter and it revised its guidance to a 2.5% fall or rise in full-price sales. Pre-tax profits for the year would now be at least \u00a3775m, up from the \u00a3748m figure pencilled in in May. As a result, Next shares were among the biggest risers in the FTSE 100, closing up 4% at \u00a353.40.",
