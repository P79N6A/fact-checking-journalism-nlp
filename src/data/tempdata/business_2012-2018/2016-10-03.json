      "bodyText": "The UK is facing a shortfall of 1.8m rental properties unless the government acts fast to slow a sharp drop in the number of available homes, according to a leading housing industry body. The Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (Rics) called on the government to drop reverse stamp duty changes on second homes and consider incentives for build-to-rent schemes, after it found a drop in property investors\u2019 appetite to add to their buy-to-let portfolios. The private sector has taken over from councils and housing associations as the biggest provider of rented homes , but Rics found that sales had slowed over the summer, after changes to the stamp duty rules. Since 1 April, anyone buying a second property has paid a higher rate of tax on the purchase, and there are signs that this has slowed demand. After a surge in sales in the first part of the year, Rics said that a net balance of 58% of estate agents had seen numbers fall since May. A survey of landlords by the group found that 86% had no plans to add to their portfolios this year. Analysis published last year by accountancy firm PwC suggested that by 2025, 7.2m households would be in rented accommodation, compared with 5.4m in 2015 and 2.3m in 2001. It predicted that a quarter of those tenants would be living in private rented accommodation. Rics said the stamp duty change, which meant landlords pay a rate three percentage points higher than owner-occupiers, could make a supply crisis more likely, and this could be exacerbated when changes to taxation of mortgage interest start to come into effect in 2017. It urged the government to drop its previous focus on homeownership and take steps to encourage the provision of more rental homes. It said the new stamp duty rates should be reversed to encourage private landlords, and that pension funds should be incentivised with tax breaks to build large scale rental properties with affordable elements. It also called for local authorities holding brownfield sites to be encouraged to release land for build-to-rent developments. Jeremy Blackburn, Rics head of policy said the country was facing a critical rental shortage. He said: \u201cThe private rented sector became a scape goat under the previous prime minister, and because of that it suffered. Yet with increasingly unaffordable house prices, the majority of British households will be relying on the rental sector in the future. \u201cWe must ensure that it is fit for purpose, and the government must put in place the measures that will allow the rental sector to thrive. Any restrictions on supply will push up rents, marginalising those members of society who are already struggling.\u201d",

Her speech came on the same day as Illinois became the second state to cut ties with the bank. The Democratic presidential nominee\u2019s criticism was part of a speech focusing on a new proposal that would make it easier for consumers to sue companies that might have wronged them. \u201cReally shocking, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Clinton said about Wells Fargo\u2019s sales practices, adding that the bank had bullied thousands of its employees into committing fraud, opening millions of accounts without customers\u2019 permission and knowledge and misusing personal information. \u201cWe are still seeing powerful bankers playing fast and lose with the law.\u201d Wells Fargo came under scrutiny from US regulators and lawmakers last month when it announced a $185m settlement for opening more than 2m accounts without customers\u2019 permission from 2011 to 2016. The unauthorized accounts were opened in order to meet quotas imposed on the bank\u2019s employees for generating new business. Bank officials insist the employees acted on their own and that their actions were not part of an \u201corchestrated effort\u201d. As of this weekend, Wells Fargo had terminated sales quotas for its retail banking products, such as credit cards, checking accounts and overdraft insurance. Clinton said that Wells Fargo\u2019s actions are an example of \u201cegregious corporate behavior\u201d. She promised that if elected president, she would hold accountable \u201cbad actor\u201d companies that scam their customers and abuse their employees. One way to do that would be to end to mandatory arbitration clauses that companies often insert into their contracts. These clauses prohibit customers from suing companies and instead mandate that disputes be resolved in arbitration. Companies like Wells Fargo \u201cuse these fine-print gotchas to escape responsibility\u201d, said Clinton. \u201cWe are going to rein that in across everybody.\u201d Wells Fargo\u2019s chief executive, John Stumpf, was asked about the bank\u2019s arbitration clause last week on Capitol Hill when he testified before the House financial services committee. \u201cIf [your customers] want their day in court, will you screw them out of that?\u201d California congressman Brad Sherman asked. Stumpf attempted to answer, saying \u201cNo, but \u2026\u201d before being interrupted by Sherman, who ended his questioning by calling for the break-up of the big banks. Clinton\u2019s speech came just hours after the Illinois state treasurer stood before a room full of reporters and announced that his state was terminating its dealings with Wells Fargo for the next 12 months. Over the past year, Illinois had more than $30bn in investment activity with the bank. The move ensures that millions of dollars in associated fees will go to other financial institutions instead of Wells Fargo. Illinois is not the first state to impose a year-long ban on investing with Wells Fargo. Last Wednesday, California announced a similar ban. Both states have suspended investments in Wells Fargo securities and use of Wells Fargo as a broker/dealer for purchases of their investments. When the one-year period is up, both states will re-evaluate their relationship with Wells Fargo and review whether the bank has put in place proper internal controls. Clinton\u2019s statements about \u201cbankers playing fast and lose with the law\u201d were unfair, according to Jamie Dimon, chairman, president and chief executive of JPMorgan Chase. \u201cWhen people blanket a whole class of people by making statements, I think that\u2019s just unfair to everybody. I could do the same thing about media, I could do the same thing about politicians or lawyers. They are just never accurate,\u201d Dimon said in an interview with CNBC following Clinton\u2019s rally. He went on to say that the banking industry is full of qualified, smart and ethical people. \u201cPeople broke the law, they should be punished but let\u2019s take a deep breath,\u201d he said.",

      "bodyText": "That\u2019s the spirit. \u201cThe Brexit debate will be seen as a drop in the ocean in the timeline of our business,\u201d says Andrew Formica, the (Australian) chief executive of Anglo-Aussie fund manager Henderson. After the merger with Janus Capital of the US, the combined company, managing $320bn of assets, will make its home in London. The firm will have two bosses \u2013 Formica will be joint chief executive with his Janus counterpart, Dick Weil \u2013 but the American will have to get out of Denver and move to the UK. Brexit-worriers will point out that Henderson\u2019s listing on the London Stock Exchange will be cancelled. New York has been given the primary listing and Sydney the secondary gig. True, but you can\u2019t have everything and there is a particular wrinkle here. Some 60% of Henderson\u2019s shares are still held in Australia and, since three listings would be silly, London was the obvious one to drop. The location of the head office was the important decision. Formica\u2019s analysis is worth noting for its matter-of-factness. Brexit hasn\u2019t altered London\u2019s status as the world\u2019s most important global financial centre. The capital will continue to enjoy the benefits of timezone and financial infrastructure. Thus it is a natural home for an asset manager running operations in the US, Europe and Asia. The calculation, we might agree, could be very different for those big banks or insurers who prize \u2018passporting\u2019 rights to operate across the EU single market. But there is no obvious reason for global asset managers to flee. Henderson\u2019s shareholders will get 57% of the equity, and thus are the senior partners in this \u201cmerger of equals,\u201d but London seems to have been preferred solely for its merit as a global hub. Shareholders may be more worried by the decision to run with two chief executives. The Roman god Janus faced two ways, but having two chiefs is a notoriously tricky arrangement to make work. The task should be easier, though, with one head office. Tesco: why we should be wary of US-style litigation The Serious Fraud Office has charged three former Tesco executives with fraud and false accounting (the trio deny the charges), but some investors don\u2019t want to let the matter end there. A group of 60 would like to be compensated for Tesco\u2019s \u00a3263m over-statement of profits in 2014. They calculate they suffered collective losses of \u00a3150m when the share price fell and argue they are entitled to expect companies\u2019 financial statements to be true and fair. Nobody would dispute the point about expecting accuracy and purity. Jeremy Marshall, chief investment officer of Bentham Europe, the firm funding the litigation against Tesco, draws a comparison with second-hand cars. You would expect redress if the vehicle you bought turned out to have 10,000 miles on the clock rather than the stated 5,000. Well, yes, but this enthusiasm for US-style litigation is troubling for several reasons. First, a litigation-hungry set of shareholders is seeking to gain at the expense of the other shareholders. That feels underhand. Second, in any share price movement, it\u2019s hard to measure specific factors precisely. Tesco\u2019s confession of an over-statement clearly contributed to fall in the share price, but by how much? How does one isolate secondary effects, like reputational damage? Third, the argument that claims for compensation help to improve boardroom governance sounds like self-interested nonsense. The SFO, the Financial Reporting Council and other bodies exist to do a job. If they do it properly, they shouldn\u2019t require assistance. Sadly, we may have to get used to more such legal cases. One senior London fund manager said he would be happy if such US-style litigation remained in the US, but he felt obliged to participate because it would be hard to explain to clients why other managers had secured a cheque while he hadn\u2019t. That is how momentum for litigation builds. The development is regrettable. Philip Hammond\u2019s \u2018midlands engine\u2019 By the time he gets to his autumn statement, let\u2019s hope chancellor Philip Hammond, above, has found some policies (and better jokes). Monday\u2019s conference speech brought news of a \u00a33bn package to increase the number of houses built in Britain \u2013 an ambition that has confounded successive governments \u2013 but there was nothing else to bite on. The definition of the \u201cnorthern powerhouse\u201d remains as obscure as it did under George Osborne. Now we have Hammond\u2019s \u201cmidlands engine\u201d. In neither case, however, is it clear how productivity in those regions is meant to improve. Are there any targets behind these boasts? If a company chief executive was making such airy promises, the shareholders would be merciless.",

New York has been given the primary listing and Sydney the secondary gig. True, but you can\u2019t have everything and there is a particular wrinkle here. Some 60% of Henderson\u2019s shares are still held in Australia and, since three listings would be silly, London was the obvious one to drop. The location of the head office was the important decision.</p> <p>Formica\u2019s analysis is worth noting for its matter-of-factness. Brexit hasn\u2019t altered London\u2019s status as the world\u2019s most important global financial centre. The capital will continue to enjoy the benefits of timezone and financial infrastructure. Thus it is a natural home for an asset manager running operations in the US, Europe and Asia.</p> <p>The calculation, we might agree, could be very different for those big banks or insurers who prize \u2018passporting\u2019 rights to operate across the EU single market. But there is no obvious reason for global asset managers to flee. Henderson\u2019s shareholders will get 57% of the equity, and thus are the senior partners in this \u201cmerger of equals,\u201d but London seems to have been preferred solely for its merit as a global hub. </p> <p>Shareholders may be more worried by the decision to run with two chief executives. The Roman god Janus faced two ways, but having two chiefs is a notoriously tricky arrangement to make work. The task should be easier, though, with one head office.</p> <h2>Tesco: why we should be wary of US-style litigation</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"37c65d33f79f59269c77660f781f8851e061dadf\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/37c65d33f79f59269c77660f781f8851e061dadf/3_0_3195_1917/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tesco\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>The Serious Fraud Office <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/sep/09/sfo-charges-former-tesco-directors-with-fraud\">has charged</a> three former Tesco executives with fraud and false accounting (the trio deny the charges), but some investors don\u2019t want to let the matter end there. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/02/tesco-faces-150m-claim-from-shareholders-to-recoup-losses\">A group of 60 would like to be compensated</a> for Tesco\u2019s \u00a3263m over-statement of profits in 2014. They calculate they suffered collective losses of \u00a3150m when the share price fell and argue they are entitled to expect companies\u2019 financial statements to be true and fair.</p> <p>Nobody would dispute the point about expecting accuracy and purity. Jeremy Marshall, chief investment officer of Bentham Europe, the firm funding the litigation against Tesco, draws a comparison with second-hand cars. You would expect redress if the vehicle you bought turned out to have 10,000 miles on the clock rather than the stated 5,000. Well, yes, but this enthusiasm for US-style litigation is troubling for several reasons.</p> <p>First, a litigation-hungry set of shareholders is seeking to gain at the expense of the other shareholders. That feels underhand. Second, in any share price movement, it\u2019s hard to measure specific factors precisely. Tesco\u2019s confession of an over-statement clearly contributed to fall in the share price, but by how much? How does one isolate secondary effects, like reputational damage?</p> <p>Third, the argument that claims for compensation help to improve boardroom governance sounds like self-interested nonsense. The SFO, the Financial Reporting Council and other bodies exist to do a job. If they do it properly, they shouldn\u2019t require assistance.</p> <p>Sadly, we may have to get used to more such legal cases. One senior London fund manager said he would be happy if such US-style litigation remained in the US, but he felt obliged to participate because it would be hard to explain to clients why other managers had secured a cheque while he hadn\u2019t. That is how momentum for litigation builds. The development is regrettable.</p> <h2>Philip Hammond\u2019s \u2018midlands engine\u2019 </h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"dd2ce0fa73bc1eefd481f472f707b395a0e8bcd9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/dd2ce0fa73bc1eefd481f472f707b395a0e8bcd9/1494_81_1804_1082/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Philip Hammond\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>By the time he gets to his autumn statement, let\u2019s hope chancellor Philip Hammond, above, has found some policies (and better jokes). <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/oct/03/conservative-conference-philip-hammond-confirms-osbornes-austerity-timetable-has-been-dropped-politics-live\">Monday\u2019s conference speech</a> brought news of a \u00a33bn package to increase the number of houses built in Britain \u2013 an ambition that has confounded successive governments \u2013 but there was nothing else to bite on.</p> <p>The definition of the \u201cnorthern powerhouse\u201d remains as obscure as it did under George Osborne.

Baring Private Equity Asia has bought out TA Associates, a US private equity company, to take control of Cath Kidston. The new owners have appointed William Flanz, the former boss of Gucci, as chairman of Cath Kidston and have identified Asia as a key market for the brand. Baring first invested in Cath Kidston two years ago when it acquired a 40% stake in a deal that valued that company at around \u00a3250m. The new deal, which involves Baring buying TA\u2019s 40% stake, is understood to value Cath Kidston at significantly more than \u00a3250m, although the price has not been disclosed. Cath Kidston founded the eponymous business with its first store in Holland Park, London, in 1993. It has become renowned for its bags, accessories and clothing in a range of floral designs. Kidston still owns approximately 11% of the business, although she stepped down as creative director in 2014. The management team owns the remaining 9% of the brand. The company now has 226 shops, with 70% outside the UK. It has 133 shops in Asia already and will open in India later this year. Last week it launched a collaboration with Disney that involves a collection of products based on Winnie the Pooh. Cath Kidston said the new products led to its biggest ever day of full-price sales online, with 58 mugs sold every hour on the day of launch and a 500% increase in online sales in Korea. Kenny Wilson, chief executive of Cath Kidston, said: \u201cWe are entering a really exciting new stage under a single owner. Baring Asia\u2019s decision to increase its shareholding is a fantastic endorsement of the potential of the Cath Kidston brand and I would like to welcome Bill Flanz. \u201cThis year has been our most successful start to the year, proving the strength of our product and the continued and growing appeal of the brand to existing and new customers.

      "bodyText": "With a timetable for Brexit now unveiled, the pound dropped sharply but UK shares went in the opposite direction. The UK currency is currently down 1% against the dollar and down a similar amount against the euro to a three year low, while the Bank of England\u2019s trade-weighted sterling index is down more than 1% to a six and a half year low. Uncertainties over the status of trade deals and economic growth once Brexit has happened has hit the pound, but conversely the FTSE 100 was flying, lifted by exporters benefitting from weaker sterling. The UK index almost broke through the 7000 barrier for the first time since May 2015, but failed to quite make it. Elsewhere European markets were more mixed, although Germany was shut for a holiday. Worries about Deutsche Bank continued to weigh on its US shares and helped pull the whole financial sector lower on Wall Street. The final scores in Europe showed: The FTSE 100 finished 84.19 points or 1.22% higher at 6983.52 France\u2019s Cac closed up 0.12% at 4453.56 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB fell 0.77% to 16,273.95 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended down 0.32% at 8751.6 In Greece, the Athens market added 0.74% to 569.72 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 88 points or 0.48%. On that note, it\u2019s time to close for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. The European Central Bank\u2019s negative interest rate policy has side effects and cutting them further would come with increasing risks, says ECB board member Yves Mersch. In a speech in Luxembourg, Mersch said: We are aware... that in particular our non-standard policy measures come with side effects. Therefore, it is important to consider the combined effect of the full package of our policy measures when assessing the impact of our monetary policy action on banks. Low rates put pressure on banks\u2019 profitability, particularly on banks which are very reliant on net interest income. Analysts forecast that negative interest rates will significantly reduce banks\u2019 profitability over the next five years, with the return on equity in some cases falling from 6.5% to 2%. Obviously, our monetary policy package consists of other measures as well and ECB staff estimates show that the overall impact on bank profitability of recent monetary policy actions is net positive, compared with a scenario with no monetary policy action[2]. But we cannot ignore such analyses. And yet, one also has to ask if a bank that cannot weather headwinds over a few years still has a sufficiently robust business model to stay in the market. Mersh added: Interest rates have to stay low until the economic recovery in the euro area has gained sufficient momentum to lift the inflation rate to a level in line with our definition of price stability. This is, however, taking longer than we had hoped, mainly because the necessary political changes to make economies more competitive and flexible are lagging behind. The sooner these reforms are implemented, the stronger and more sustainable the recovery will be. Although the notion of a \u201czero lower bound\u201d no longer stands, there is a limit to how low interest rates can go \u2013 the point at which the costs of lower rates incurred by the banking sector outweigh the benefits. Many consider that we have reached the \u201ceffective lower bound\u201d or that it might be not that far from the current deposit facility rate of -0.4%. This level I would still deem to be \u201cmildly negative\u201d \u2013 but I would shy away from moving into \u201cwildly negative\u201d territory. Cutting interest rates even more would come with increasing risks as reactions to such cuts might not always be linear. The continuing fall in the pound is not necessarily a major reason for concern, according to Jonathan Loynes at Capital Economics: While the latest dip in sterling has partly reflected concerns over the prospect of a \u201chard Brexit\u201d, the currency\u2019s depreciation should continue to cushion the economic impact of the vote to leave the EU. Sterling\u2019s latest drop appears to have been at least partly prompted by speculation that the UK government is willing to accept a hard form of Brexit, in which the country would forego full access to the EU single market, in order to secure full control over its borders. Along with confirmation that the Government will trigger Article 50 by next March, this may have increased concerns over the ultimate economic impact of the vote to leave the EU. But there are a number of reasons not to be concerned about the currency\u2019s depreciation. For a start, it is far from clear that further indications of a move towards a hard Brexit should necessarily be strongly negative for the economy or the pound. They may, after all, reflect increased confidence that the UK can negotiate favourable trading arrangements with the EU without the conditions that a \u201csoft Brexit\u201d might imply. Second, the key driver of sterling\u2019s depreciation (against the US dollar at least) has continued to be relative changes in expectations for UK and US interest rates. As such, there are few signs of a general \u201cBrexit premium\u201d being attached to the currency which might prompt a more disorderly depreciation. And finally, regardless of its causes, the drop in sterling has already had a substantial effect in cushioning the economic impact of the Brexit vote. Monday\u2019s Markit/CIPS manufacturing PMI survey revealed a further rise in the export orders sub-index to a level consistent with a rapid acceleration in the growth of actual exports in the coming months. Admittedly, the economy may currently be in a \u201csweet spot\u201d in which the beneficial effects of the pound\u2019s drop have been felt before the adverse effects on real incomes of the consequent rise in inflation. But provided that the pound\u2019s fall remains relatively orderly \u2013 our forecast is that it will fall from around $1.28 now to $1.20 next year \u2013 we expect the inflationary effects to be fairly limited and short-lived, allowing the policymakers to continue to support growth. Back to Greece where pictures of police firing tear gas at pensioners peacefully demonstrating against further cuts has caused deep embarrassment to the government \u2013 just as it tables next year\u2019s budget in parliament. Helena Smith reports from Athens The sight of protesting pensioners having pepper spray fired at them by police overzealously protecting the road on which his office stands, could not have come on a worse day for prime minister Alexis Tsipras. The leader, like all leftists in the ruling Syriza party, is painfully aware that it is pensioners who to date have paid the heaviest price for the austerity meted out in return for bailout funds. As I was told by many attending today\u2019s (otherwise low-key) rally, the latest cut was the twelfth they have been forced to endure since the beginning of the debt crisis in late 2009. To make matters worse, Tsipras\u2019 poll ratings are fading fast. In the most scathing survey to be published since he first assumed power in January 2015 \u2013 and in the newspaper of Avgi, the mouthpiece of his ruling Syriza party no less - the leader was found by the Public Issue polling company to be trailing Kyriakos Mitsotakis, chief of main opposition New Democracy, by 19 points in terms of suitability in the role of prime minister (42 percent against 23 percent). A whopping 36 percent of Greeks said they would prefer to see New Democracy in power compared to 14 percent for Syriza and its junior right wing partner, Anel. Which explains why Tsipras, who was otherwise focusing on what he hoped would be an optimistic draft budget forecasting growth and debt decline, personally called the pubic order minister in fury that the tear gas was used at all. In an unprecedented statement the ministry announced: \u201cAfter today\u2019s incident the order was given to forbid any use of tear gas at demonstrations of workers and pensioners.\u201d That notwithstanding, the episode duly eclipsed any talk of the draft budget - which foresees growth of 2.7 per cent n 2017, debt dropping from 180 to 174.8 per cent of GDP and unemployment falling from 23 to 22.4 percent next year \u2013 being tabled and debated in parliament. Greek media have not been slow to pick up on the fact that it also projects an extra \u20ac1.8bn worth of revenues in taxes \u2013 prompting many to say that yet more punitive belt-tightening measures are on the way. Royal Bank of Scotland will pay Connecticut $120m to resolve a mortgage bond probe, according to Reuters. Meanwhile, as investors await news about whether the $14bn fine on Deutsche Bank demanded by the US Department of Justice will be reduced, the bank\u2019s US shares have now dropped by around 2.5%. The ISM report could also signal a reasonable non-farm payrolls number on Friday, says James Knightley at ING Bank: Looking to Friday\u2019s payrolls figure, the ISM employment component has offered encouragement to us regarding our above consensus 210,000 prediction for job creation. This index rose to 49.7, up from 48.3, while also rising above the six month moving average of 49.4. With the consumer confidence report showing a marked pick-up in households feeling that jobs are \u201cplentiful\u201d the signs look pretty good for a decent rebound following a rather disappointing 151,000 gain last month. Despite the ISM manufacturing data strengthening the case for the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates before the end of the year, analysts are divided about whether it will actually happen. David Morrison, senior market strategist at Spreadco, said: Last month the US manufacturing sector contracted for the first time in six months. It was one of the major data releases which led many commentators to doubt that the Fed would hike rates at its September meeting. Today\u2019s release has gone some way to countering fears that the US economy isn\u2019t as robust as the FOMC would like us to believe. In that respect, it strengthens the likelihood of a December hike. Later this week we\u2019ll get an update on the services sector with Non-Farm Payrolls wrapping things up on Friday. If the data comes in better-than-expected, the we should see the dollar strengthen further. But Paul Sirani, chief market analyst at Xtrade, said: It has been a tough few months for US manufacturing, so Janet Yellen and her colleagues at the Fed will be happy to see an above expectations rise on the ISM PMI gauge for September. The reading signifies a return to expansion for the manufacturing sector, and will provide another tick for the Fed\u2019s widely-expected interest rate hike later this year. However, that rate increase remains contingent on stable growth, and as we enter the final weeks of a highly contentious presidential election, unpleasant surprises could be just around the corner. If Markit\u2019s survey is showing a slowdown in US manufacturing growth, then a second survey is more positive. The Institute of Supply Management\u2019s manufacturing index jumped to 51.5 in September, a turnaround from August\u2019s surprisingly weak 49.4. Anything below 50 shows contraction, so the September figure shows a return to growth. The outcome is better than the 50.3 expected by analysts. The new orders and employment indices were also higher than had been forecast. Markit\u2019s chief business economist Chris Williamson has a rather downbeat view on the US PMI data. He said: Manufacturing growth slowed to a crawl in September, suggesting the economy is stuck in a soft-patch amid widespread uncertainty in the lead up to the presidential election. The survey saw firms pulling back on expanding production and focusing instead on cost-cutting, as inflows of new business slowed to the weakest seen so far this year. Any growth is largely being driven by the consumer, in turn helped by tail-winds of low interest rates, low inflation and a solid labour market. Business spending, in contrast, is being subdued by the headwinds of uncertainty about the economic outlook, cost-driven inventory reduction and the strong dollar, the latter linked to yet another drop in exports. US manufacturing dipped slightly in September but came in slightly better than initially anticipated. In the first of two surveys, Markit\u2019s final manufacturing PMI for September was 51.5 compared to the flash estimate of 51.4 and 52 in August. Deutsche Bank\u2019s US shares are currently down around 1.2% in early trading, as investors await any signs that a deal on its Department of Justice fine may be near. US markets are on the slide in early trading, as investors await a spate of data this week, starting with manufacturing PMIs and culminating on Friday with non-farm payrolls. With oil prices coming off their best levels, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has dropped around 70 points in early trading while the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq Composite have both opened around 0.25 lower. The fall on Wall Street has taken the shine off shares elsewhere, with the FTSE 100 off its best levels at 6971, up around 72 points. Deutsche Bank\u2019s shares jumped on Friday on talk it may agree a deal with the US Department of Justice to pay a fine of some $5.4bn over mis-selling mortage bonds, rather than the $14bn initial demand. There was even some talk of a deal coming over the weekend, given some plausibility by the fact that the bank\u2019s chief executive John Cryan is in the US. Germany\u2019s stock market is closed today for a holiday which would - the theory went - give some breathing space for a deal to be done. But so far no announcement, so the bank\u2019s US shares - also up sharply on Friday - are down around 1.8% in pre-market trading, according to Reuters. And here is a sign of improvement in Asia: Ahead of the latest US manufacturing data- which are expected to be fairly upbeat - ratings agency FItch has cut its forecast for the country\u2019s growth this year. In its latest bi-monthly Global Economic Outlook, Fitch says: Downside risks to advanced country economic growth have risen in recent months... With populism gaining traction in many countries, the risk of political shocks adversely affecting the outlook for private investment has increased. At the same time, the capacity of central banks to engender stronger growth appears to be diminishing... With eurozone growth looking likely to have peaked in early 2016 and no significant changes to Fitch\u2019s UK and Japanese growth forecasts - despite significant monetary policy moves - the outlook for the advanced countries is best described as a low-growth, muddle-through path. Advanced country growth over 2016 to 2018 will be hardly any better than the lacklustre 1.5% annual average growth rate seen over 2011 to 2015. Moreover, downside risks to advanced country growth have increased. \u201cThe rise in populism seen in many advanced countries could be a precursor to increased trade-protectionism and growing fragmentary tensions in the eurozone, both of which would increase uncertainty and damage prospects for private sector investment,\u201d added [Fitch chief economist Brian] Coulton. On the US in particular it says: Fitch has revised down its forecast for US growth in 2016 to 1.4% in today\u2019s Global Economic Outlook from 1.8% in the July [report]. \u201cThis year is likely to see the lowest annual growth rate for US GDP since 2009 as oil sector adjustments, weak external demand and the earlier appreciation of the dollar take their toll on industrial demand,\u201d said [Coulton]. Fitch also believes central banks may be running out of ammunition: Meanwhile, the capacity of central banks to counter adverse growth shocks may be falling. The implications of low and negative interest rates for bank profitability, the increasing complexity of central bank easing announcements, reductions in interest income for savers and market distortions are complicating the transmission of unconventional monetary easing to the economy. Furthermore, the historically unprecedented nature of negative nominal interest rates may be limiting the benefits of central bank easing announcements on inflation expectations. Rising political pressures and concerns about the effectiveness of monetary easing have contributed to growing support among policy makers for fiscal stimulus as a means of restoring growth. A wider shift to fiscal easing is increasingly apparent in the numbers and while its effectiveness may be hindered in some countries by high and rising public debt levels, a co-ordinated fiscal reflation is likely to have growth benefits, at least in the short term. The Fed is likely to be the only major central bank tightening monetary policy in the near term as it lays the groundwork for a December rate rise. With unit labour costs and core inflation measures suggesting underlying inflation close to the Fed\u2019s target and the labour market holding up, the conditions look to be in place for a continuation of gradual normalisation in the Federal Funds Rate. The ECB is expected to extend its quantitative easing programme beyond its current scheduled end-date of March 2017, and will likely need to adjust the limits on bond purchases. The new monetary policy approach adopted by the Bank of Japan (BOJ) opens the door for further cuts in the policy rate, taking it deeper into negative territory. This will allow the BOJ to steepen the yield curve while it varies its asset purchases to hold 10-year JGB yields flat at around 0%. We now forecast the BOJ policy rate will fall to -0.5% by end-2017. In the UK, the Bank of England\u2019s (BoE) aggressive easing package in early August has had a positive impact on sentiment. With recent UK data slightly better than expected, the BoE is unlikely to follow through on forward guidance to cut rates again before year-end. In emerging markets, Fitch sees signs of improvement: Most importantly, China\u2019s efforts to stabilise growth in the face of a sharp slowdown in exports and private-sector investment look to have gained traction. Russia\u2019s economy looks to be stabilising after massive import compression, real wage adjustment and fiscal tightening saw domestic demand plummet in 2015. In Brazil, the impeachment of President Rousseff and installation of a new leadership team have renewed focus on fiscal reforms, which should support confidence and help the economy stabilise by year-end. Time for a catch-up, as City traders scoff down a quick sandwich before facing another volley of economic data from across the Atlantic. Activity in Britain\u2019s factory sector has grown at its fastest pace since June 2014, bolstering hopes that the EU referendum won\u2019t trigger a recession. Exports, new orders and staffing levels all increased in September, as the weak pound helps firms sell overseas. Economists broadly agree that UK manufacturing appears to be in decent health right now, and helped the economy grow in the last quarter. Capital Economics, for example, say: The Markit/CIPS manufacturing PMI for September showed that both the domestic and export-facing parts of the manufacturing sector are weathering the Brexit vote well. And the sector should contribute to an expansion in GDP in Q3. In the Eurozone, Germany\u2019s manufacturing firms also had a good month. France, Ireland and the Netherlands did less well, though, while Greece slipped back into contraction. The pound has fallen by 1%, close to a 31-year low against the US dollar. The selloff was sparked by prime minister Theresa May laying out her Brexit plans. Analysts fear that sterling will remain weak, as the government appears to be heading towards a hard Brexit. Currently, the pound is hovering around $1.288 against the US dollar - a three month low. It\u2019s also close to the 31-year low struck in late June. Sam Hill of RBC Capital Markets says the City is worried about the prospect of Smexit - or exit from the Single Market. For businesses whose prospects are sensitive to the freedoms of Single Market membership, the Prime Minister\u2019s broad message is the clearest signal yet that Brexit could force potentially significant changes to current arrangements with EU countries. It is too soon to know whether or not successor arrangements will end up being better or worse for the UK\u2019s prosperity in the long run. But, even if current economic data suggests economic performance is showing resilience to the referendum result, May\u2019s stance is a reminder that uncertainties related to Smexit turbulence could be costly for the economy in the short run. But London\u2019s stock market is romping ahead, hitting a new 16-month high today. The FSTE 100 is up 83 points at 6982, as the weaker sterling pushes up the value of international blue-chip companies. Other markets are calm, as traders take a day off worrying about Deutsche Bank\u2019s negotiations with the DoJ over a multi-billion fine for misconduct before the financial crisis. Henry Croft, research analyst at Accendo Markets, says: Equities are making gains globally, with weakened Pound Sterling affecting play in the UK whilst subsiding fears about the size of the impending US DoJ fine for Deutsche Bank are helping global markets during a market holiday in Germany. Greek media are now reporting that the government has banned the police from using teargas against pensioners, after today\u2019s clashes. Nektaria Stamouli of the Wall Street Journal tweets that the order came from prime minister Alexis Tsipras: AP has more details of today\u2019s clashes: Dozens of protesters at the front of the rally tried to break through a police cordon and chanted \u201cShame on you, shame on you!\u201d The protesters were trying to tip over a riot police bus when officers fired the pepper spray. There\u2019s not much cheer in Greece this morning, as the government prepares to present its 2017 budget to parliament. First up, Markit reported that Greece\u2019s manufacturing sector shrank in September - after posting some much needed growth in August. The manufacturing PMI fell to 49.2 points last month from 50.4 in August, indicating activity contracted. That won\u2019t help Athens hit its growth and fiscal surplus targets, set with its lenders in return for a third bailout. Meanwhile on the streets, Greek pensioners have scuffled with riot police during a protest against pension cuts. Local media report that the police fired pepper spray at the crowds. James Knightley of ING also believes there is \u201csignificant doubt\u201d that the Bank of England will cut interest rates at its next meeting, in November. It all depends on the economic data, including a healthcheck on the dominant services sector on Wednesday. We will see later this week if the (much larger) service sector is rebounding to the same extent. If not...then there remains a case for further BoE stimulus later this year. However, if the service PMI does indeed improve then it is looking as though the BoE will hold off until the new year and it will be up to Chancellor Philip Hammond to provide some medium to longer term fiscal support in November Today\u2019s strong-looking manufacturing data gives the Bank of England lots to think about. BoE policymakers may feel they deserve some credit. They rapidly slashed interest rates and boosted its stimulus programme after the Brexit vote, in an attempt to prop up confidence. But...if that plan is actually working, there\u2019s less justification for another cut in borrowing costs, from 0.25% to just 0.1%. Economist Rupert Seggins tweets: Ms Lee Hopley, Chief Economist at EEF, the manufacturers\u2019 organisation, is encouraged that Europe\u2019s factory sector posted faster growth last month too (see earlier post for details). \u201cToday\u2019s expectation\u2013busting surge in manufacturing activity points to conditions across industry being considerably better than business as usual, with expansion in output and new orders in all industry segments boding well for growth in the second half of this year. \u201cThe UK is not alone in seeing positive manufacturing indicators this month with solid gains in the eurozone suggesting there is some momentum building behind the manufacturing recovery in developed economies. While UK exporters have the added boost from the weaker exchange rate, it\u2019s the prospect of brighter demand prospects that provides confidence that growth will hold up.\u201d Today\u2019s PMI report is the latest sign that Britain\u2019s economy didn\u2019t shrink after the Brexit vote, says Sky News\u2019s Ed Conway. A weak currency may be good for exports, but it also pushes up the cost of imported goods. And today\u2019s report shows that UK manufacturers are having to pay more for raw materials from overseas, and \u2013 importantly \u2013 passing some of the bill onto their own customers. Markit says: Higher import costs, a by-product of the weak exchange rate, led to a further substantial increase in average purchase prices in September. Manufacturers passed on part of the rise to clients in the form of higher charges. Output price inflation remained well above the series average. Sterling tumbled by over 10% after the EU referendum, and has struggled to recover any ground since. This chart shows how this quickly hit factories in the pocket: Not everyone is convinced that Britain\u2019s factory sector has entered the sunlit uplands of prosperity and growth. Shannon Murphy, manufacturing specialist and assistant head of risk underwriting at Euler Hermes (the trade insurance group) says UK manufacturing still faces challenges: \u201cPent up order books from before the EU referendum provided a late summer boom that has glossed over the more modest reality facing manufacturers. \u201cConfidence remains thin on the ground. Most management teams are more concerned with protecting margins and avoiding payment issues, rather than exploring growth opportunities. \u201cRising staffing levels indicate that firms are not expecting a significant slump, but increasing import costs are putting up barriers to growth and inflating end-user prices.\u201d Dave Atkinson, head of manufacturing at Lloyds Bank Commercial Banking, says UK factory bosses have responded well to the Brexit vote: \u201cBritish manufacturers have used their agility and experience to build momentum during a period of uncertainty, growing their order books in a time when others have put expansion plans on hold. After its early wobble, the British pound is doing its best to recover. But despite the strong factory growth, sterling is still down around one cent at $1.288 - a three month low. Mike Rigby, head of manufacturing at Barclays, says the jump in UK factory output last month is encouraging: \u201cManufacturers continue to show their grit following the Brexit vote with today\u2019s figures reporting increasing output and a healthy flow of new orders for September. Moreover, exporters continue to step up activity to make the most of the weak pound although the flip side of that coin is that rising input costs will have to be absorbed somewhere. We can now expect the sector to be looking increasingly towards November\u2019s Autumn Statement to see how the government proposes to bolster industry and the UK economy.\u201d Today\u2019s forecast-smashing data shows that Britain\u2019s factories are benefitting from the slump in sterling since June\u2019s referendum. So argues Rob Dobson, senior economist at IHS Markit: \u201cSeptember saw the UK Manufacturing PMI rise to its highest level since mid-2014, recovering further from its EU referendum inspired low in July. The rebound over the past two months has been encouragingly strong, and puts the sector on course to provide a further positive contribution to GDP in the third quarter. \u201cThe weak sterling exchange rate remained the prime growth engine, driving higher new orders from Asia, Europe, the USA and a number of emerging markets. The domestic market is also still supportive of growth, especially for consumer goods. Further step-ups in growth of new business and output in the investment goods sector may also be a sign that capital spending is recovering from its early year lull, in the short term at least. Hold onto your hats, folks. Britain\u2019s factory sector has just posted its strongest growth in over two years. The latest manufacturing healthcheck, from Markit, shows that export orders jumped at their fastest rate since January 2014. That suggests the weak pound is helping UK firms sell their goods overseas. Factories also took on more workers, with employment rising for the second straight month. Markit says that: Job creation was linked to increased capacity requirements, new order growth and the launch of new product lines. This drove the UK manufacturing PMI up to 55.4 in September, up from 53.4 in August. That\u2019s the highest since June 2014. It\u2019s the latest sign that the June EU referendum has not sent the UK economy into a recession. Firms reported that production grew at its fastest pace since May 2014 - led by the consumer goods sector. Reaction to follow.... That strong eurozone factory data, plus the impact of the weak pound, has driven Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 even higher: The pound, though, continues to suffer a bad morning - hitting a three-month low against the US dollar. Conner Campbell of City firm SpreadEx comments: Plunging 1% against the dollar and 0.9% against the euro, sterling has been spooked by May\u2019s promise to trigger the dreaded Article 50 by the end of March 2017. Not only that, the PM has also put her weight behind a \u2018hard Brexit\u2019 to appease the more rabid members of the Tory party, something that is set to cause conflict between her and her backbenchers. Combine all this volatility together and the pound has been left at its worst price since the start of July. For the FTSE, on the other hand, sterling\u2019s slump is merely another reason to climb higher. Newsflash: The Eurozone\u2019s factory sector picked up pace in September, as the Brexit shock faded away. A new survey from Markit, the data provider, shows that manufacturing activity jumped last month - mainly driven by Germany. In an encouraging sign, output, new orders, new export business and employment all improved during the month. This pushed up Markit\u2019s manufacturing PMI (a measure of activity) up to 52.6, from 51.7 in August. That shows that growth accelerated. However, growth slowed in the Netherlands and Ireland - and France suffered another (small) contraction. Chris Williamson, Chief Business Economist at IHS Markit, says the eurozone manufacturing sector expanded at an \u201cencouragingly solid pace\u201d \u201cProduction gains are being driven by welcome signs of improving demand from both within the region and from wider export markets. \u201dFor a region beleaguered by still-high overall unemployment, the fact that the upturn is generating more jobs is especially good news. The latest rise in factory payroll numbers was one of the best seen over the past four years. However, the upturn is \u201cworryingly uneven\u201d, reliant on a \u2018core\u2019 centred on Germany and its neighbours. German manufacturers reported their second-best month for two-and-a-half years, with strong performances also seen in the Netherlands and Austria. \u201cIn contrast, growth remains far weaker than earlier in the year in Spain, Italy and Ireland, while manufacturing in France continues to decline. Greece has meanwhile also slipped back into contraction. Policymakers will nevertheless at least be pleased to see survey indices coming off their recent lows in Spain, Italy and Ireland.\u201d Shares are rallying in London this morning, as traders start the final quarter of 2016. The blue-chip FTSE 100 has gained 57 points in early trading to 6956. That\u2019s a new 16-month high! Internationally-focused companies are leading the rally, as they get a lift from the weaker pound (it makes their exports more competitive, and their foreign earnings more valuable in sterling terms). So, it\u2019s no surprise to see oil group Royal Dutch Shell and pharmaceuticals firm Hikma among the risers. But.... the smaller FTSE 250 index, which contains more UK companies, is also having a good morning. It\u2019s up 129 points, or 0.7%. That\u2019s partly due to a 17% surge from Henderson, the fund manager, which announced a shock merger with asset manager Janus this morning. The pound\u2019s weakness is casting a shadow of the Tory party conference, as delegates convene for the second day of their Birmingham shindig. And as we like to spoil you, here\u2019s Andy Sparrow\u2019s Politics Live blog, with all the latest developments: Boom! The pound just hit a new three-year low against the euro, at 87.34p, as the selloff intensifies. It just hit a three-month low against the US dollar too, at $1.2845. Traders are reacting to Theresa May\u2019s Brexit strategy, and the potential economic cost of exiting the single market by 2019. Marc Ostwald of ADM Investor Services says: The Tory party conference is the main item on the policy events agenda. The weekend announcement that Article 50 will be triggered by March 2017, and that there will be an omnibus bill to repeal EU laws and convert them into UK laws confirms that the \u2018phoney war\u2019 is now effectively over. The City is also waiting to hear chancellor Philip Hammond\u2019s conference speech this lunchtime. He\u2019s expected to pledge to deliver \u2018fiscal discipline\u2019, even as he (probably) abandons the goal of a surplus this parliament. The prime minister\u2019s pledge to make a clean break from the EU, starting in March 2017, has electrified the City this morning. Many experts are warning that the pound could suffer further losses in the run-up to Christmas. Kathleen Brooks, research director at City Index, says there is still uncertainty over Britain\u2019s future relationship with the EU, and over how the exit will be handled. While May suggested that the UK would shift away from the single European market, she did not mention what it will be replaced with, or how the UK will negotiate new trade deals with Europe and the rest of the world. May\u2019s speech seems to suggest that the UK\u2019s prime minister is content with winning back the UK\u2019s \u201csovereignty\u201d at the cost of a period of economic disruption, which is likely to be negative for the pound. While sustained pound weakness may be less fierce than it has been in recent months \u2013 sterling had its worst quarterly performance between June and September since 1984 - we continue to think that the balance of Brexit talk remains bearish for the pound, and sterling could remain unloved into the end of this year. Kit Juckes of French bank Societe Generale confirms that May\u2019s promise to trigger Article 50 by the end of Q1 2017 has hurt the pound, but adds: Absolutely no-one is going to change their view of the UK economy, sterling or the wider implications of \u2018Brexit\u2019 until there are mountains of evidence about the economic impact. The pound has also hit a seven-week low against the euro, at 87.18p. That\u2019s a drop of 0.6% this morning. Brexit worries have pushed the pound back towards the 31-year lows plumbed in the aftermath of June\u2019s referendum. Sterling has lost over half a cent in early trading, dropping to \u00a31.2902 against the US dollar. That\u2019s the lowest level in seven weeks. That follows yesterday\u2019s surprise news that article 50 will be triggered within six months. Traders are also reacting to Theresa May\u2019s declaration that she wants a clean break from the European Union, with full control of immigration and an end to the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice. This is being interpreted as leading to a \u2018hard Brexit\u2019, in which Britain would also leave the singe market - meaning significant disruption for the City. Hussein Sayed, chief market strategist at currency trading firm FXTM, predicts months of lively trading in the foreign exchance markets. Teresa May announced on Sunday that U.K.\u2019s divorce from the EU will start within 6-months. Article 50, the official notification to Britain\u2019s partners will be triggered before the end of March 2017, which gives another two years to agree on the terms of the most complicated divorce in recent history. The pound\u2019s imminent reaction was a drop of 0.5% against the dollar in early Asian trading session, nothing compared to the 11% freefall after U.K.\u2019s vote to leave the EU on June 23. Now with the timeline being set, the negotiation of the terms will be a key driver for sterling going forward, but I expect it to be rough ride in the next few months. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Just three months to go until we consign 2016 to the history books, and investors have lots to worry about. 1) Britain\u2019s exit from the EU became rather more real yesterday, after Theresa May announced she would trigger article 50 by March 2017. The PM also appeared to throw her weight behind a so-called \u2018Hard Brexit\u2019, meaning the UK could leave the single market in two years. Our Politics team report that some Conservative MPs will be pushing for a softer Brexit instead; meaning more uncertainty over the whole thing. 2) Deutsche Bank faces another crunch week in its battle to secure its future. There\u2019s no word, yet, on whether it has managed to haggle down that $14bn fine from the DoJ. Over the weekend, top German business leaders rallied behind the company, with some accusing America of \u201ceconomic warlike traits\u201d. It looks like talks are continuing between the two sides over a final deal. 3) We get a new healthcheck on the European economy this morning, with the latest manufacturing PMIs. They\u2019re expected to show that factory output continued to grow in September, as Brexit fears dissipate. Britain\u2019s manufacturing survey, due at 9.30am BST, will be particularly closely watched. Its expected to show that growth slowed last month, with the PMI dropping from 53.3 to 52.1. We\u2019ll be tracking all the main events through the day....",

Therefore, it is important to consider the combined effect of the full package of our policy measures when assessing the impact of our monetary policy action on banks. </p> <p>Low rates put pressure on banks\u2019 profitability, particularly on banks which are very reliant on net interest income. Analysts forecast that negative interest rates will significantly reduce banks\u2019 profitability over the next five years, with the return on equity in some cases falling from 6.5% to 2%. </p> <p>Obviously, our monetary policy package consists of other measures as well and ECB staff estimates show that the <strong>overall</strong> impact on bank profitability of recent monetary policy actions is net positive, compared with a scenario with no monetary policy action<sup>[<a href=\"https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/key/date/2016/html/sp161003.en.html#footnote.2\">2</a>]</sup>. But we cannot ignore such analyses. And yet, one also has to ask if a bank that cannot weather headwinds over a few years still has a sufficiently robust business model to stay in the market.</p> </blockquote> <p>Mersh added:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Interest rates have to stay low until the economic recovery in the euro area has gained sufficient momentum to lift the inflation rate to a level in line with our definition of price stability. This is, however, taking longer than we had hoped, mainly because the necessary political changes to make economies more competitive and flexible are lagging behind. The sooner these reforms are implemented, the stronger and more sustainable the recovery will be. </p> <p>Although the notion of a \u201czero lower bound\u201d no longer stands, there is a limit to how low interest rates can go \u2013 the point at which the costs of lower rates incurred by the banking sector outweigh the benefits. Many consider that we have reached the \u201ceffective lower bound\u201d or that it might be not that far from the current deposit facility rate of -0.4%. </p> <p>This level I would still deem to be \u201cmildly negative\u201d \u2013 but I would shy away from moving into \u201cwildly negative\u201d territory. Cutting interest rates even more would come with increasing risks as reactions to such cuts might not always be linear. </p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-10-03T16:38:32.534Z\">at 5.38pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-57f27461e4b0643b5d8439d6\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-03T15:12:36.204Z\">4.12pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The continuing fall in the pound is not necessarily a major reason for concern, according to Jonathan Loynes at Capital Economics:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>While the latest dip in sterling has partly reflected concerns over the prospect of a \u201chard Brexit\u201d, the currency\u2019s depreciation should continue to cushion the economic impact of the vote to leave the EU.</p> <p>Sterling\u2019s latest drop appears to have been at least partly prompted by speculation that the UK government is willing to accept a hard form of Brexit, in which the country would forego full access to the EU single market, in order to secure full control over its borders. Along with confirmation that the Government will trigger Article 50 by next March, this may have increased concerns over the ultimate economic impact of the vote to leave the EU.</p> <p>But there are a number of reasons not to be concerned about the currency\u2019s depreciation. For a start, it is far from clear that further indications of a move towards a hard Brexit should necessarily be strongly negative for the economy or the pound. They may, after all, reflect increased confidence that the UK can negotiate favourable trading arrangements with the EU without the conditions that a \u201csoft Brexit\u201d might imply.</p> <p>Second, the key driver of sterling\u2019s depreciation (against the US dollar at least) has continued to be relative changes in expectations for UK and US interest rates. As such, there are few signs of a general \u201cBrexit premium\u201d being attached to the currency which might prompt a more disorderly depreciation.</p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p>And finally, regardless of its causes, the drop in sterling has already had a substantial effect in cushioning the economic impact of the Brexit vote. Monday\u2019s Markit/CIPS manufacturing PMI survey revealed a further rise in the export orders sub-index to a level consistent with a rapid acceleration in the growth of actual exports in the coming months.</p> <p>Admittedly, the economy may currently be in a \u201csweet spot\u201d in which the beneficial effects of the pound\u2019s drop have been felt before the adverse effects on real incomes of the consequent rise in inflation. But provided that the pound\u2019s fall remains relatively orderly \u2013 our forecast is that it will fall from around $1.28 now to $1.20 next year \u2013 we expect the inflationary effects to be fairly limited and short-lived, allowing the policymakers to continue to support growth.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57f266bde4b0ff53b531bbb3\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/helenasmith\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-03T14:40:16.310Z\">3.40pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Greek pensioner protests overshadow budget unveiling</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Back to Greece where pictures of police firing tear gas at pensioners peacefully demonstrating against further cuts has caused deep embarrassment to the government \u2013 just as it tables next year\u2019s budget in parliament. Helena Smith reports from Athens </p> <blockquote> <p>The sight of protesting pensioners having pepper spray fired at them by police overzealously protecting the road on which his office stands, could not have come on a worse day for prime minister Alexis Tsipras. The leader, like all leftists in the ruling Syriza party, is painfully aware that it is pensioners who to date have paid the heaviest price for the austerity meted out in return for bailout funds. As I was told by many attending today\u2019s (otherwise low-key) rally, the latest cut was the twelfth they have been forced to endure since the beginning of the debt crisis in late 2009. To make matters worse, Tsipras\u2019 poll ratings are fading fast. In the most scathing survey to be published since he first assumed power in January 2015 \u2013 and in the newspaper of Avgi, the mouthpiece of his ruling Syriza party no less - the leader was found by the Public Issue polling company to be trailing Kyriakos Mitsotakis, chief of main opposition New Democracy, by 19 points in terms of suitability in the role of prime minister (42 percent against 23 percent). A whopping 36 percent of Greeks said they would prefer to see New Democracy in power compared to 14 percent for Syriza and its junior right wing partner, Anel. </p> <p>Which explains why Tsipras, who was otherwise focusing on what he hoped would be an optimistic draft budget forecasting growth and debt decline, personally called the pubic order minister in fury that the tear gas was used at all. In an unprecedented statement the ministry announced: \u201cAfter today\u2019s incident the order was given to forbid any use of tear gas at demonstrations of workers and pensioners.\u201d </p> <p>That notwithstanding, the episode duly eclipsed any talk of the draft budget - which foresees growth of 2.7 per cent n 2017, debt dropping from 180 to 174.8 per cent of GDP and unemployment falling from 23 to 22.4 percent next year \u2013 being tabled and debated in parliament. Greek media have not been slow to pick up on the fact that it also projects an extra \u20ac1.8bn worth of revenues in taxes \u2013 prompting many to say that yet more punitive belt-tightening measures are on the way. </p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fad7952f9f110336c6737afe6ab1ad11cbd6f9b7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fad7952f9f110336c6737afe6ab1ad11cbd6f9b7/0_0_4826_3205/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Protestors clash with police in Athens\" width=\"1000\" height=\"664\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Protestors clash with police in Athens</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: ZUMA W/REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57f269d8e4b0328d7eb88c9b\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-03T14:25:39.387Z\">3.25pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Royal Bank of Scotland will pay Connecticut $120m to resolve a mortgage bond probe, </strong>according to Reuters.</p> <p>Meanwhile, as investors await news about whether the $14bn fine on Deutsche Bank demanded by the US Department of Justice will be reduced, the bank\u2019s US shares have now dropped by around 2.5%.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57f2682ce4b0ff53b531bbbc\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-03T14:17:42.344Z\">3.17pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The ISM report could also signal a reasonable non-farm payrolls number on Friday, says James Knightley at ING Bank:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Looking to Friday\u2019s payrolls figure, the ISM employment component has offered encouragement to us regarding our above consensus 210,000 prediction for job creation.

With populism gaining traction in many countries, the risk of political shocks adversely affecting the outlook for private investment has increased. At the same time, the capacity of central banks to engender stronger growth appears to be diminishing...</p> <p>With eurozone growth looking likely to have peaked in early 2016 and no significant changes to Fitch\u2019s UK and Japanese growth forecasts - despite significant monetary policy moves - the outlook for the advanced countries is best described as a low-growth, muddle-through path. Advanced country growth over 2016 to 2018 will be hardly any better than the lacklustre 1.5% annual average growth rate seen over 2011 to 2015. Moreover, downside risks to advanced country growth have increased.</p> <p>\u201cThe rise in populism seen in many advanced countries could be a precursor to increased trade-protectionism and growing fragmentary tensions in the eurozone, both of which would increase uncertainty and damage prospects for private sector investment,\u201d added [Fitch chief economist Brian] Coulton.</p> </blockquote> <p>On the US in particular it says:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Fitch has revised down its forecast for US growth in 2016 to 1.4% in today\u2019s Global Economic Outlook from 1.8% in the July [report].</p> <p>\u201cThis year is likely to see the lowest annual growth rate for US GDP since 2009 as oil sector adjustments, weak external demand and the earlier appreciation of the dollar take their toll on industrial demand,\u201d said [Coulton].</p> </blockquote> <p>Fitch also believes central banks may be running out of ammunition:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Meanwhile, the capacity of central banks to counter adverse growth shocks may be falling. The implications of low and negative interest rates for bank profitability, the increasing complexity of central bank easing announcements, reductions in interest income for savers and market distortions are complicating the transmission of unconventional monetary easing to the economy. Furthermore, the historically unprecedented nature of negative nominal interest rates may be limiting the benefits of central bank easing announcements on inflation expectations.</p> <p>Rising political pressures and concerns about the effectiveness of monetary easing have contributed to growing support among policy makers for fiscal stimulus as a means of restoring growth. A wider shift to fiscal easing is increasingly apparent in the numbers and while its effectiveness may be hindered in some countries by high and rising public debt levels, a co-ordinated fiscal reflation is likely to have growth benefits, at least in the short term.</p> <p> The Fed is likely to be the only major central bank tightening monetary policy in the near term as it lays the groundwork for a December rate rise. With unit labour costs and core inflation measures suggesting underlying inflation close to the Fed\u2019s target and the labour market holding up, the conditions look to be in place for a continuation of gradual normalisation in the Federal Funds Rate. The ECB is expected to extend its quantitative easing programme beyond its current scheduled end-date of March 2017, and will likely need to adjust the limits on bond purchases. The new monetary policy approach adopted by the Bank of Japan (BOJ) opens the door for further cuts in the policy rate, taking it deeper into negative territory. This will allow the BOJ to steepen the yield curve while it varies its asset purchases to hold 10-year JGB yields flat at around 0%. We now forecast the BOJ policy rate will fall to -0.5% by end-2017. </p> <p>In the UK, the Bank of England\u2019s (BoE) aggressive easing package in early August has had a positive impact on sentiment. With recent UK data slightly better than expected, the BoE is unlikely to follow through on forward guidance to cut rates again before year-end.</p> </blockquote> <p>In emerging markets, Fitch sees signs of improvement:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Most importantly, China\u2019s efforts to stabilise growth in the face of a sharp slowdown in exports and private-sector investment look to have gained traction.

      "bodyText": "Uncertainty about the size of a penalty for a decade-old misselling scandal knocked shares in Deutsche Bank lower on Monday amid renewed doubts about the ability of Germany\u2019s biggest bank to withstand the cost of any settlement with the US Department of Justice (DoJ). With Germany\u2019s stock market closed for a public holiday, its shares traded lower in New York as a stock research firm warned that Deutsche might want to tap shareholders for more cash in the wake of a fine. The bank\u2019s shares had surged on Friday following reports that the settlement with the DoJ would be $5.4bn (\u00a34.2bn) rather than the $14bn first suggested a fortnight ago. However, the absence of further news rattled US investors on Monday and Deutsche shares had fallen 3% by the time European markets were closing. Speculation about the prospect of a deal with the DoJ over the misselling of residential mortgage-backed securities (RMBS) between 2005 and 2007 has been fuelled by the plans of John Cryan, Deutsche\u2019s chief executive, to attend the International Monetary Fund\u2019s annual meeting in Washington DC. This is regarded as an opportunity to thrash out a settlement ahead of the US general election next month. But as Cryan prepared to attend the high-profile gathering he faced criticism from Germany\u2019s minister for economic affairs, Sigmar Gabriel, for blaming speculators for the dive in the bank\u2019s shares to 30-year lows. \u201cI did not know if I should laugh or cry that the bank that made speculation a business model is now saying it is a victim of speculators,\u201d Gabriel said. He was responding to the memo Cryan sent to 100,000 employees on Friday blaming \u201cforces in the market\u201d for destabilising the bank. Cryan is in the process of restructuring the bank and, according to reports, is close to achieving the agreement with local unions to cut 1,000 jobs. Cryan has insisted that he does not need the help of the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, to prop up the bank, which has lost more than half its value on the stock market this year and is regarded by the IMF as the world\u2019s riskiest bank. A research note by brokers at Autonomous, cited by Bloomberg, said investors regarded a rights issue \u2013 a cash call on existing shareholders \u2013 as the \u201cmost likely tool management will use\u201d to bolster market sentiment. But the ratings agency Moody\u2019s said it regarded any deal with the DoJ as more likely to knock profits rather than undermine its financial strength. Peter Nerby, senior vice-president at Moody\u2019s, calculated that Deutsche could face a settlement of between $1.1bn and $5.7bn by analysing the size of agreements the DoJ has reached with US banks. Even at the higher end, Nerby said: \u201cThis would require an addition to our assumed DoJ settlement reserve of \u20ac2.4 bn, which would dent 2016 profitability but would not significantly impair its capital position.\u201d Friday\u2019s report by the news agency AFP that Deutsche might pay $5.4bn helped bolster its shares, although the Wall Street Journal cautioned on Monday that neither the DoJ or Deutsche had yet agreed on a deal. Deutsche is one of a number of European banks \u2013 including Barclays and Royal Bank of Scotland \u2013 that face settlements with the DoJ. RBS, which could face a bill of \u00a39bn from the DoJ, is in the process of tackling as many as 20 lawsuits relating to the matter. On Monday, the state of Connecticut said the 73% taxpayer-owned bank had agreed a $120m settlement over misselling RMBS.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The pound has sunk to a three-year low against the euro on worries over the UK\u2019s prospects outside the EU, after the government set a timetable for Brexit negotiations and fanned fears it would go for a deal that leaves Britain excluded from the single market. Sterling came under pressure on Monday after Theresa May used her weekend speech at the Conservative party conference to pledge to trigger article 50 before the end of March. The prime minister raised the possibility of a hard Brexit as she spelled out that greater border controls would trump any attempt to remain a member of the single market. That pushed the pound down sharply against the euro single currency to \u20ac1.1438 in afternoon trading, a drop of 0.9% on the day. The pound was also down more than 1% against the US dollar to $1.2835, not far off a 31-year low hit in the wake of June\u2019s shock referendum result. Sterling\u2019s weakness contrasted with a rally on stock markets where share prices were lifted by a combination of near-term economic optimism, relief over May providing some certainty on Brexit timing and the effects of a weak pound, which flatters the earnings of UK-listed firms reporting in dollars. \u201cBrexit continues to be the word of the day, with the markets somewhat caught between the future consequences of Britain\u2019s separation from the EU and the lack of discernible impact in the past few months,\u201d said Connor Campbell, analyst at the financial spread betting firm Spreadex. \u201cWhile the FTSE is celebrating the UK\u2019s recent, and unexpected, economic sturdiness, the pound has its eye on a time when Britain officially no longer belongs to the European Union.\u201d The FTSE 100 index of bluechip shares rose more than 1% to a 16-month high of 6,996. The more domestically focused FTSE 250 was also up, by 1.6% at 18,152, boosted by a surge in the shares of Henderson, the fund manager, which announced a merger with the asset manager Janus. Henderson shares were up 17% at 271p. The mood was further bolstered by a poll of manufacturers that suggested factory activity expanded at the fastest pace for more than two years in September, helped by stronger export orders on the back of the pound\u2019s fall after the EU referendum. The survey chimed with other recent reports suggesting businesses and consumers have largely recovered from the initial shock of the Brexit vote in June. The key index on the Markit/Cips UK manufacturing PMI (pdf) rose to 55.4 from 53.4 in August, beating forecasts for 52.1 in a Reuters poll of economists and the highest since June 2014. The survey also showed manufacturing production expanded at the quickest pace since May 2014, employment rose for the second month running and new orders picked up thanks to higher sales to domestic and overseas clients. New export orders grew at the fastest pace since January 2014 as the weak pound continued to make UK goods more competitive overseas. The flipside of the weaker pound was further upward pressure on import costs for manufacturers and they passed part of that on in higher prices last month. Rob Dobson, senior economist at IHS Markit, which compiled the survey, said the latest improvement in the PMI report from its post-referendum low in July was encouraging for overall growth prospects. \u201cThe rebound over the past two months has been encouragingly strong, and puts the sector on course to provide a further positive contribution to GDP in the third quarter,\u201d he said. The survey follows official figures last week showing stronger-than-expected growth after the referendum in the services sector, which accounts for about three-quarters of the economy. Other official data also showed the economy went into the vote with slightly faster growth than previously thought. The chancellor, Philip Hammond, seized on signs of economic strength in his address to the Conservative party conference in Birmingham. \u201cThe markets have calmed since the referendum vote. And many of the recent data have been better than expected. That is the clearest demonstration of the underlying strength of our economy,\u201d he said, without referring to the pound\u2019s fall. Currency traders had more long-term concerns on their minds as they digested the prime minister\u2019s weekend comments, said Chris Saint, senior analyst, at City firm Hargreaves Lansdown Currency Service. \u201cSterling\u2019s woes are being compounded by speculation the UK could take the hard Brexit route, sacrificing access to the EU single market in return for greater control over immigration,\u201d he said. There were also fresh warnings about reading too much into early signs of resilience to the referendum outcome. Statisticians have cautioned against reading too much into any single month\u2019s data and point out that figures can get revised over time as more information comes in. Economists warn that various factors could soon weigh on spending power and sentiment. \u201cNotwithstanding the stronger-than-expected run of economic data thus far, we expect that consumers, who until now have remained resilient in the face of Brexit, may struggle to maintain their optimism in the face of rising inflation and a softer labour market,\u201d said Dean Turner, economist at UBS Wealth Management.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "A Tory government will bridge regional divides, give young people a foot on the housing ladder and raise workers\u2019 productivity. And that is just an hors d\u2019oeuvre, according to Philip Hammond, who argued government intervention was needed to protect everyone from the Brexit fallout, especially when they neither voted to be poorer nor to face an uncertain future. The chancellor promised \u201ca new plan for the new circumstances Britain faces\u201d as he junked George Osborne\u2019s austerity programme in favour of pragmatism. Revealing his soft Brexit sympathies, he made it clear that quitting the European Union posed the biggest threat to the economy and he was ready to use it as an excuse for significant spending plans. Not on his watch would the economy nosedive, wiping out many of the gains made in employment and rising wages over the last couple of years. He left the Conservative party audience in no doubt that while those ministers negotiating Brexit might be happy to wave goodbye to the single market, the chancellor wants to retain full access. For that reason he was clear the referendum vote regained control over Britain\u2019s borders and courts, but could not be a deterministic influence on immigration. He also explained that Brexit meant abandoning Osborne\u2019s pursuit of a balanced budget by 2020. Between several passages of praise for his predecessor, he conceded that the chase was over. Worse for the audience, one that only last year cheered the prospect of a budget surplus in 2021, no new date was set. Then came the end of laissez faire, with Hammond following hard on the heels of communities secretary Savid Javid and business secretary Greg Hands, making the case for ministers to take an active role in the economy. Earlier, Hands said Britain would never win a race to the bottom and had no option but to support a hi-tech, low carbon future to attract major employers and big-paying jobs. Javid added some cheer to the proceedings with a \u00a33bn package to support house building by 2020.

      "bodyText": "Britain is missing out on billions of pounds in exports every year because of a failure to help small and medium-sized companies crack new markets, according to an analysis that highlights firms\u2019 worries about exporting after Brexit. The UK is among the five worst performing countries in Europe when it comes to getting small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) exporting, says the report (pdf) from the Centre for Economics and Business Research (CEBR) consultancy. The low share of total UK exports that comes from SMEs puts the country at the bottom of European rankings alongside Germany, Sweden, Poland and Finland. But the UK and Germany are also in the top five spots for the level of absolute exports, thanks to the success of their larger firms in trading overseas. The CEBR said bringing smaller firms\u2019 export rates more in line with larger firms\u2019 trading patterns could provide a significant boost to government plans to almost double UK exports to \u00a31tn by 2020 \u2013 a target it is widely expected to miss by a significant margin. The report found that less than a fifth of the UK\u2019s SMEs were selling their goods and services overseas, compared with two-fifths of big businesses in the UK. Helping more SMEs enter new markets and bringing their export rate up to 40%, could reap \u00a3141.3bn a year in overseas sales, the analysis claimed. \u201cGiven that SMEs account for around 60% of all private sector employment in the UK and just under half of the overall turnover in the UK\u2019s private sector, there is considerable scope to boost the number of SMEs selling goods and services overseas and, as a result, raise the overall level of exports across the UK economy,\u201d the report stated. While the potential gains from more SME exports look good on paper, they appear much harder to achieve in reality as underscored by the CEBR\u2019s polling of 1,054 smaller and medium-sized companies to accompany its analysis. The polling of SME bosses showed only 5% had plans to start exporting in the next five years and more than two-fifths of those polled said Brexit would hinder their ability to export. The report, commissioned by the currency and money transfer company World First, came alongside the chancellor\u2019s attempts to allay business fears about a \u201chard Brexit\u201d, which could see the government striking a deal to leave the EU that excludes Britain from the single market. In his Conservative party conference speech on Monday, Philip Hammond pledged to fight for \u201cthe best possible access to European markets for our manufacturing and services industries\u201d. The World First/CEBR report found that alongside Brexit, potential exporters were put off from selling into overseas markets by language barriers and cultural differences. Language was the top barrier by SMEs looking to enter the Asia-Pacific region and South America (21%). Culture was named as the biggest barrier for SMEs wanting to enter Africa and the Middle East. Asked about the decision to leave the EU, 42% of SMEs said it would hinder them; 19% said it would help them. Just over a third, or 35%, said it would make no difference. \u201cThe fallout from the UK referendum has also brought about a significant amount of uncertainty for businesses but, if anything, it reinforces the importance of taking a global view and exploring new markets,\u201d said World First\u2019s chief executive, Jonathan Quin. \u201cAs the government\u2019s Brexit negotiations take centre stage over the next few years, we would urge that SMEs are included and actively consulted throughout the process in order to ensure their views and needs are actively considered.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The biggest asset management deal since the Brexit vote, bringing together Anglo-Australian group Henderson and Janus Capital of Denver, is to have its headquarters in London in a signal that the City remains at the heart of the world\u2019s financial system. The combined group will have $320bn (\u00a3249bn) of total assets under management, with the chief executive of Janus, Dick Weil, relocating from Denver to London to co-manage the merged group with Henderson\u2019s Andrew Formica. Formica said: \u201cLondon still acts as the heart of the global financial system and as a pivot between the US and Asia ... over a 10 to 15-year view, the Brexit debate will be seen as a drop in the ocean in the timeline of our business.\u201d But the merger is a blow for the London Stock Exchange, with the primary listing for the merged group moving to New York, with a secondary listing in Sydney. The deal brings controversial billionaire bond investor Bill Gross under the roof of the combined group. Gross shot to fame in 2010 when he warned that the UK was a \u201cmust to avoid\u201d for his investors as its debt was \u201cresting on a bed of nitroglycerine\u201d. At the time he was acting for Pimco in California, running the world\u2019s biggest bond fund, but left for Janus in 2014 and subsequently issued a $200m lawsuit against his former employers. Formica said there were no new lock-in arrangements for individual fund managers but it is expected that Gross will stay. After the EU referendum, Henderson was hit by outflows from its property fund, prompting its suspension, along with many others in the industry. But Formica said there has since been a \u201creduced pattern of retail outflows, offset by institutional inflows\u201d. The newly merged group promises \u201csynergy\u201d savings of $110m a year, although it is not clear where the cuts will come from. Janus is largely a US-facing group with tiny operations in London, while Henderson, which acquired New Star in 2009 and Gartmore in 2011, is largely UK and European, but with a significant presence in Australia. Both Janus and Henderson face the challenge of a shift away from expensive \u201cactive\u201d fund management towards low-cost index management, where funds track market indices but are much less profitable for fund groups. Formica said the combined group, to be called Janus Henderson, will keep active management \u201cat the heart of what we do\u201d. The deal is likely to have only a minor impact on small savers with investments in Henderson funds. Darius McDermott of Chelsea Financial Services said: \u201cNot much will change for those who already invest with Henderson and all the funds we rate will continue to be rated. What we should gain from the merged companies is even more choice: Janus are particularly good in Japanese and US equities, which are gaps in the Henderson range.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Has a bad year for Britain\u2019s manufacturers come to an end? It seems that way from the latest industry survey. Output expanded in September at the same rate seen this time last year and the sector has started adding jobs. This follows a slump between January and August when firms were shedding jobs at an alarming rate, especially for an industry that has yet to recover the levels of output it enjoyed before the 2008 banking crash. A closer look at the Markit/Cips index of activity shows that most subsectors expanded after a broad-based jump in domestic demand. And exports rose on the back of the recent 10% fall in the value of sterling. That all bodes well for a balanced recovery. It also takes the pressure off the Bank of England, which can set aside plans for a further interest rate cut. But few analysts expect the manufacturing sector to recapture the glory days of 2014 \u2013 the brief period when factory output growth appeared to have gained some much-needed momentum. The slowdown in China\u2019s manufacturing between the summer of 2013 and this summer, which hit global trade, was the first blow before the Brexit vote added a twist of anxiety. Official figures are also gloomier, showing the manufacturing sector doing no more than bouncing back from a recession. Worse, the pharmaceuticals industry, once a star performer and singled out by the previous government as a key to making Britain great again, has suffered a sharp decline. Even Theresa May\u2019s comments that she will trigger article 50 and the official Brexit talks in March is a silver lining with a dark cloud attached. The continued slide in the currency, boosting British exports abroad, is the silver lining. The dark cloud can be seen in the shape of a stumbling European economy, wounded by potentially fractious Brexit negotiations. It is a scenario that frightens businesses and the government. With British business in such a febrile state, it falls to Philip Hammond to provide a degree of security. The chancellor has been clear that business and consumer confidence could suffer during the long Brexit process. Hopefully the autumn statement will outline how he plans to intervene, providing more than warm words and platitudes that generate only more anxiety.",

      "bodyText": "A weaker pound and a stronger oil price has sent the UK market sharply higher, with Royal Dutch Shell leading the way. Shell\u2019s A shares are up 49.5p to 1963.5p while its B shares are 51.5p better at 2048.5p, while BP has climbed 7.3p to 457.3p. Brent crude is up 1% at $50.69 in the wake of last week\u2019s moves by oil producers to curb output. Sterling fell back after UK prime minister Theresa May set out the timetable for Brexit, although it has regained some ground after much stronger than expected manufacturing PMIs for September. The weaker pound helps exporters - which dominate the FTSE 100 - and commodity companies. So pharmaceutical group Hikma is 50p higher at \u00a320.68 while Anglo American has added 19.6p to 987.2p. Overall the FTSE 100 has hit a 16 month high, adding 65.58 points to 6964.92. Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at IG, said: Over the weekend we all got a little more clarity on what Brexit actually means, although Theresa May continues to say relatively little in order to keep her options open, a course of action used to good effect in recent months by Fed chair Janet Yellen. A slump in sterling made life easier for UK markets, with price action so far this morning seeing high-quality international firms receiving a flood of buyers. Another rise in the UK\u2019s manufacturing PMI helped sterling to recover some of its losses, and while the move this morning has garnered plenty of attention it is a pale imitation of the action seen in the immediate aftermath of the Brexit vote. The bullish activity in markets this morning has been helped in no small measure by the closure of German markets for a holiday, which has had the beneficial effect of sparing us any Deutsche Bank headlines. The rumoured DoJ deal failed to materialise over the weekend, which might mean that the shares are due another trimming when the Dax reopens tomorrow. Other risers include Babcock International, up 17p to \u00a310.52 after JP Morgan raised their target price from \u00a314.27 to \u00a314.40. But defensive stocks such as utilities were down as investors moved back into riskier assets. Severn Trent has slipped 21p to \u00a324.84 while British Gas-owner Centrica is down 1.4p to 226.8p as RBC analysts moved from 0utperform to sector perform, and cut their target price from 250p to 240p. BT is down 4.5p at 384.55 following a report the telecoms company is struggling to agree a deal with regulator Ofcom about the future structure of its Openreach business. Among the mid-caps fund management firms were on the rise as US asset manager Janus Capital agreed on a $6bn merger with Henderson Group, up 12% to 260p. The news has sent Aberdeen Asset Management 14.2p higher to 340.5p and Jupiter Fund Management up 18.6p at 444p.",

      "bodyText": "The stamp collecting firm Stanley Gibbons has slumped to a \u00a329m annual pre-tax loss and detailed a litany of financial woes after discovering \u201cfundamental errors\u201d in the company\u2019s accounts. In a dismal update that sent its shares down 10% in early trading on Monday, the accountancy firm BDO said it did not have sufficient evidence to perform a proper audit and warned of \u201csignificant doubt about the group\u2019s ability to continue as a going concern\u201d. The group is undergoing what it described as an \u201cunsettling\u201d restructuring effort, which forced it to restate results from previous financial years, scrap its dividend and shut its online marketplace. The collectibles firm, which was founded in 1856, has also cut jobs, reduced its office space and overhauled its management team. Its chairman Harry Wilson, who was appointed in May, commissioned a review after a dire year that led it to issue two profit warnings and tap shareholders for cash. In his latest sombre update, Wilson said the business had gone \u201cbadly adrift\u201d under previous directors, almost all of whom have left the business. Stanley Gibbons lost \u00a329m before tax in the year to the end of March on revenues of \u00a359m, after taking one-off charges of \u00a324m. The firm issued a lengthy confessional note entitled \u201cWhat went wrong?\u201d, explaining its woes to shareholders, who it said \u201cdeserve an explanation of the combination of events leading to the severely disappointing trading result\u201d. It follows a review by accountants at BDO, who discovered mistakes in the way Stanley Gibbons reported revenue banked from the sale of investment plans in its stamp-trading business. The resulting restatement of figures from previous years led to the value of its assets being slashed by 43%, while its bank debt nearly doubled to \u00a321.9m. It was forced to take \u00a324m of one-off charges, including the write-off of its online collectibles business, The Marketplace, launched as a rival to eBay for trading items such as commemorative coins and stamps. Stanley Gibbons said the business, started only last year, was an \u201cill-conceived, badly managed project which was allowed to severely over-run budgeted expenditure\u201d. The firm parted company with almost its entire boardroom over the summer, with the chief executive, Mike Hall, and finance director, Donal Duff, leaving in July. The new team wasted no time in outlining their predecessors\u2019 failings. The firm highlighted the twin acquisitions of the fine wine, jewellery and antiques trader Noble Investments as well as Mallett, which specialises in art and furniture. The company said the acquisitions were \u201cpoorly managed and, as a result, failed to instil a cohesive, UK-based management structure with adequate challenge and competition for capital\u201d. The firms were not properly integrated, left the group too reliant on certain customers, ate up investment and left the business in too much debt, it added. The firm\u2019s previous auditors, Nexia Smith &amp; Williamson, quit last month, saying the risks of the audit \u201cexceed the level that they are willing to accept\u201d. But Stanley Gibbons said the review of its business had identified \u00a310m of annual cost savings by reducing its office space, cutting jobs and axing The Marketplace. \u201cThe restructuring review identified the need for dramatic changes across the group, which were long overdue and have now been initiated,\u201d Wilson said. He was upbeat about the group\u2019s prospects once the restructuring effort was complete. \u201cThe market for rare collectibles and fine art remains buoyant for collectors and given the low interest rate environment continues to offer an attractive alternative for investment,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Brexit vote has added a degree of uncertainty over the macro environment but quality collectibles have traditionally maintained their value and appeal over the long term and particularly in times of uncertainty.\u201d",

But Stanley Gibbons said the review of its business had identified \u00a310m of annual cost savings by reducing its office space, cutting jobs and axing The Marketplace.</p> <p>\u201cThe restructuring review identified the need for dramatic changes across the group, which were long overdue and have now been initiated,\u201d Wilson said.</p> <p>He was upbeat about the group\u2019s prospects once the restructuring effort was complete. \u201cThe market for rare collectibles and fine art remains buoyant for collectors and given the low interest rate environment continues to offer an attractive alternative for investment,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cThe Brexit vote has added a degree of uncertainty over the macro environment but quality collectibles have traditionally maintained their value and appeal over the long term and particularly in times of uncertainty.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "The heads of Australia\u2019s big four banks will appear before a parliamentary committee in Canberra this week, starting on Tuesday. Malcolm Turnbull asked them to appear in response to political pressure for a royal commission into the banking industry. He maintains there is no need for a royal commission. He says the hearings will be an annual event, and that will ensure regular parliamentary scrutiny of the major banks. But Labor and the Greens are critical of the process. They say the hearings will only be a \u201cshow\u201d for the government to appear as though it\u2019s getting tough on the banks. They say the 10-member committee is weighted heavily with Coalition members \u2013 the Coalition has six members, Labor three and the Greens one. They say each committee member will only have 20 minutes to ask questions of each bank chief, so that leaves little time for prickly questions from Labor or Greens MPs. They say that amount of time is insufficient to tackle serious issues such as insurance scams and ripoffs, the CommInsure scandal, multimillion-dollar pay packages and incentive structures for bank employees that encouraged fraud. They say they\u2019ll do what they can with their time. The Labor MP Matt Thistlethwaite will be presenting fresh evidence from whistleblowers to show that scandals and unethical behaviour are still occurring in the banking industry. The Greens MP Adam Bandt says a prima facie case has already been made for a royal commission so it\u2019s up to bank bosses to dissuade committee members of the need to continue pushing for one. But Coalition MPs will approach the hearings differently. They have prepared questions that will steer the discussion away from the fiery topics the Greens and Labor want to pursue. They want to keep things calm, measured and focused on microeconomic issues such as competition between the banks and how easy it is for customers to switch between them. They say a stable financial system should take precedence, and they also want to know how effectively the system is working for customers. The most emotional topic the Coalition wants to explore is the redress for consumers who have been victims of poor bank behaviour. They have already flagged that they\u2019re interested in the idea of a \u201cone-stop shop\u201d for financial customers who feel mistreated. They are planning to raise the idea of a banking tribunal \u2013 now being considered by a panel chaired by Prof Ian Ramsay, which is reviewing the financial system\u2019s external dispute resolution and complaints framework. It shows the difference between the government and the opposition \u2013 generally speaking, the government will be focusing on the microeconomic and the future; Labor and the Greens will be focusing on scandals they say haven\u2019t been addressed properly. Steven M\u00fcnchenberg, the chief executive of the Australian Bankers\u2019 Association, says bank chiefs hope they will be allowed to explain \u201cin a measured, calm way\u201d how they have responding to serious problems in the financial advice industry. They also hope to explain how interest rate decisions are made, and how tougher prudential regulations have made banks stronger but have put pressure on margins. \u201cOur main concern is this just descends into a political exercise of the government and opposition attacking each other,\u201d M\u00fcnchenberg told Guardian Australia. \u201cBill Shorten has come out today saying he\u2019ll never stop pushing for a royal commission, so the signal that sends us is that it doesn\u2019t matter how comprehensive the improvements are the industry makes, for whatever reason he\u2019ll continue to push for a royal commission even if the issue\u2019s already been dealt with.\u201d The committee chair, the Liberal MP David Coleman, says he wants the hearings to be well-run and professional to set a serious precedent for subsequent hearings. Turnbull has been emphasising the fact that the hearings will be an annual event because that means they\u2019ll change Australia\u2019s banking and political culture for the better.

      "bodyText": "The treasurer, Scott Morrison, and the finance minister, Mathias Cormann, \u201ctook out the garbage\u201d last Friday afternoon, dumping the final budget outcome for 2015-16 on the Treasury website under the cover of the football grand finals, a long weekend and the start of school holidays around much of the country. Morrison and Cormann came close to breaching the Charter of Budget Honesty, which requires the release of each budget outcome for the prior financial year by 30 September each year. They made it with a few hours to spare. They also released it without a press conference or detailed media release, making sure there was miniscule coverage of something that would normally be a key area of economic and fiscal management. This is especially the case with \u201cbudget repair\u201d, the \u201creturn to surplus\u201d, \u201cpaying off debt\u201d and dealing with the \u201cbudget emergency\u201d being the basis that saw the Coalition elected to power in both September 2013 and July 2016. Looking at the budget outcome document, it is clear why it was released in the shadows of the Friday night without any fanfare. The 2015-16 budget deficit was $39.6bn or 2.4% of gross domestic product. When the former treasurer Joe Hockey delivered the first budget of the Coalition government in May 2014, the budget deficit for 2015-16 was forecast to be $17.1bn. Much of the blowout was due to decisions of the Coalition government. Foregoing revenue from the carbon price, gifting $8.8bn to the RBA and ramping up spending on border protection without any offsets were vital. The Coalition, contrary to all perceptions, has been spending at an alarming rate. In 2012-13, the last full year of the previous Labor government, the ratio of government spending to GDP was 24.1%. In 2014-15, this had risen to 25.6% and, in 2015-16, it rose to 25.7% of GDP. The 1.6% of GDP blowout in spending between 2012-13 and 2015-16 is about $26bn and accounts for more than the blowout in the deficit from the time of the 2014 budget. The deficit blowout fed into the level of government debt as it had to ramp up its borrowing to cover the ever growing shortfall. Net government debt rose to $296.4bn at June 2016, up from $153bn in June 2013 just before the Coalition took power. As a share of GDP, net government debt has risen from 10% to 18%, just off the all-time high in the wake of the second world war. When the 2016 Myefo is released before year end, net government debt will be at a 60-year high and rising. Gross government debt, according to the final budget outcome documents, rose to $420.4bn, or 25.5% of GDP, in June 2016. This is at the highest since 1971-72 when the Vietnam war effort was being funded. Government debt is growing at a pace that will no doubt be the focus of the credit ratings agencies. Unless there is some miracle in terms of a growth spurt that fuels an unexpected windfall revenue gain to the government, further large budget deficits are likely in the near term, as are further increases in government debt. It is little wonder Morrison and Cormann were nowhere to be seen when the budget outcome document popped up in the Treasury website on Friday afternoon. Interestingly Morrison did some media interviews that day \u2013 but only to talk about the Cronulla Sharks being in the football grand final. There were none on the budget. Unfortunately, this is economic management 2016 style, under the watch of Scott Morrison. It is not a good look when the deficit continues to grow and government debt is rising at a rapid pace. The credit ratings agencies are no doubt circling, looking to downgrade Australia\u2019s credit rating. If the policy approach to the budget deficit is to bury important news on a Friday afternoon and not talk about it, the downgrade seems assured.
