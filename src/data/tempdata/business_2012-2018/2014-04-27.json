      "bodyText": "One of Britain's fastest growing independent energy suppliers is on Monday offering to act as a co-ordinator and technology partner to local communities in a move it believes could bring up to 500 new power providers onstream by 2020. Ovo Energy expects to encourage local authorities, community groups and other bodies to supply energy to people who have lost faith in the prices and practices of the much criticised big six firms. Stephen Fitzpatrick, the founder and managing director of Ovo, says an open access technology model similar to the one Amazon uses in retail could also kickstart a revolution in power supply. \"One of the great myths of today's energy industry is that we need big, centralised energy companies to keep the lights on.

The plans also come a little over a month after Ofgem and the Competition and Markets Authority recommended a major investigation into the malfunction of a power sector dominated by a small number of huge companies. A recent YouGov survey showed that three times more people believed they would get a fairer deal from a community-based energy supplier than a large company answerable to big City shareholders. The community model is already used heavily in countries on the continent, especially in Germany where more than half of electricity and gas is provided by local municipalities or other community organisations. Fitpatrick, who has already held talks with a range of local authorities, said he would continue to run his own Ovo Energy supply business alongside the Amazon-style platform but said he did not want to become \"one of the big seven\". \"We see ourselves as very different from other big energy companies.

What is surprising is that the switch is painted onto the wall. More surprising still is that the company says the button does not need to be there at all: you could in theory tap anywhere on the wall and a light would come on. The light switch acts as an illustration of the young company's core product \u2013 an electric paint or \"paintable wire\" which can be applied to paper, wood, cement and textiles, among other materials, and becomes conductive once it dries. From its most simple use of lighting up a tiny bulb on a birthday card to creating an over-sized game controller for consoles or painting an entire wall so that when it is touched a light comes on, the liquid has been used for a variety of applications since the four founders of the company came up with the idea while working on a final-year project together at the Royal College of Art. In 2009, Isabel Lizardi, Matt Johnson, Bibi Nelson and Becky Pilditch wanted to investigate whether they could print an electrical circuit on to the body, eventually settling on an idea for an electric paint. After looking at the ingredients of existing conductive paints, the group examined how they could bind together a conductive powder into a paint \u2013 their first experience was copper powder in glue \u2013 and eventually came to a formula using carbon, a similar concept to the non-toxic paint they now sell. Early tests show the paint on skin being used as a conductor between a battery and a tiny bulb which lights up. \"The project was four months long and by the time we got to the idea that we wanted to create a material, I think we had a month left so we spent a month figuring out how to create this prototype,\" said Nelson. \"We were quite rigorous in our analysis of existing materials. It is based on a lot of similar paints in that they were made in a similar way without realising it necessarily at the time. We just needed to figure it out as quickly as we could. We also thought that 'this is as far as it will go'. We never imagined that afterwards we would need to develop it for manufacture \u2013 it was just to prove the idea, and that was it.\" After the paint was displayed at a student design conference in Eindhoven, interest from the public started to build. Soon, an email from Sony Music arrived saying they had an artist who wanted to use the paint in a music video. In the film, dancers' feet and hands were painted while they stood on a pad of the dried fluid, which was in turn connected to computers. The dancers became extensions of a circuit so that when their hands were slapped by the DJ Calvin Harris, various drums and beats would sound \u2013 a system dubbed a \"humanthesizer\". The film sparked huge interest across the web, and the four graduates were exposed to a deluge of suggestions from the public about what the paint could be used for \u2013 an experience they say they were not ready for. \"At the time the tutors were saying 'you are doing interesting work but what is it for?' and we kept saying that we know it is interesting so we feel we should keep doing it, but we were also not sure that we are the best people for deciding what it is for exactly,\" said Johnson. \"That mentality of saying we are creating a platform and then giving it to other people and then they tell us \u2013 that is what the business is built on now and it has given us a lot of success.\" By 2010, after leaving the idea of a body paint behind due to the complex cosmetic manufacturing regulations they would have to follow, they came to the conclusion that there was a business opportunity in their \"paintable wire\". A \u00a3100,000 grant from the Technology Strategy Board allowed them to advance their plans and also acted as a validation for their idea, to attract other investment. By September 2011, they started to sell jars of the paint and soon after a pen from which lines of circuits could be drawn. \"The best thing about the material and our approach is that it provides for engagement of multiple kinds of intelligence. We go to a trade fair and an electrical engineer picks this up and starts asking detailed questions. But then someone else comes who knits for a living and they want to make their knitting responsive and their skills and intelligence are engaged at the same point,\" said Johnson. Kits are now produced which allow children to learn about electronics by drawing their own greeting cards with lights on them and making a small cardboard house with a the inside. Concert posters that play music when you touch them have been discussed, while an artist has mixed the paint with oil in a lamp so that when the lamp is tilted, the light dims. A blogger painted a cushion with large buttons to play games on her computer, and invitations to a party have been turned into musical instruments by being plugged in. The company has now expanded to eight people, while seven private investors have put in \u00a3450,000. A Kickstarter campaign to launch a programmable circuit board has been oversubscribed eightfold. Sales for this year are anticipated to exceed \u00a31m, according to Johnson. The product has not been without criticism from those who question why the paint has no exact end use. \"I think it is that people aren't comfortable because they want a simple story about [how] we are going to reinvent the Oyster card or we are going to build the world's tallest building and say 'that's easy'. \"And we say 'we know it's great but we don't know where it is going to end up yet'.\" How it works Bare Conductive's black paint uses carbon to conduct electricity when it dries after being applied by a brush, roller, stencil, pen or any method usually used to apply paint. It can be used domestically to fix broken electronics, such as remote controls, while hobbyists use it to create things such as drumkits which can sense hand movements without being touched. A 10ml pen costs \u00a36, a 50ml tub costs \u00a318, a card with three greeting cards and electronics costs \u00a315. The products are sold through he Science Museum in London, on the company's website and in Radioshacks in the United States among other outlets.",

      "bodyText": "Get ready for the celebrations. Tuesday sees the release of Britain's growth figures for the first three months of 2014 and they will show a hefty rise in national output. An increase of 1% in gross domestic product is possible. This has political significance given that a year ago there were fears the UK was about to descend into a triple-dip recession and that a year from now the parties will be counting down the days to a May 2015 general election. You can write the headlines now: \"Boom-boom Britain\"; \"Britain back with a bang\"; \"Never had it so good\". A recovery is happening and there is no immediate sign of a slowdown. For the government, this is helpful, since the economy is a big \u2013 though not the only \u2013 factor in determining who wins elections. Whether the recovery is for keeps is a different matter. Those who think it is, see fixing the economy after the crash of 2008 as a technical matter; a bit like a mechanic repairing a car that is basically sound but has been driven recklessly. The Treasury and the Bank of England have stuck their heads under the bonnet, tinkered around a bit with regulation, interest rates, quantitative easing and tax breaks, and the engine is now running as sweet as a nut. Job done. This is a convenient explanation, because it implies that there was nothing fundamentally wrong with the economic model in 2007. It suggests we can forget the talk about rethinking how economics is taught, and brush aside inconvenient distractions such as class, ethics and distribution of the fruits of growth because the iron laws of the market will take care of everything in time. Economics undergraduates at Manchester University have put up a determined resistance to this orthodox view of the world and recently published a report on what is going wrong with the teaching of economics, complete with a foreword by the Bank of England's Andy Haldane. The report notes: \"Economics education at Manchester has elevated one economic paradigm, often called neo-classical economics, to the sole object of study. Other schools of thought \u2013 such as institutional, evolutionary, Austrian, post-Keynesian, Marxist, feminist and ecological economics \u2013 are almost completely absent.\" Haldane says it is time to recast economics and suggests returning to the book Adam Smith wrote before the Wealth of Nations, the Theory of Moral Sentiments. This was the tome in which Smith highlighted the need for co-operation rather than competition, and said ethics and fairness were crucial to a successful economy. \"Smith is being rediscovered in his true colours: as political scientist, sociologist and moral philosopher\", Haldane says. \"This is evidenced in the upsurge in interest in integrating the insights from other disciplines into economics: history, psychology, anthropology, evolutionary biology, sociology and neuroscience to name but six.\" The lesson to be learned from other disciplines is that economics is messy and complex. It is not neat and tidy and comprehensible with a few pages of elegant algebra. All of which brings us back to the growth figures. The conventional wisdom is that policy stimulus has worked. Consumers have been love-bombed with enough cheap money to get them back into the shops and the estate agencies. Growth will be sustained this year because falling unemployment will lead to a rise in real wages. Investment will kick in as firms respond to higher consumption. A period of strong expansion will come to an end once all the spare capacity left after the recession has been used up, and the economy will then settle down to a period when both annual growth and inflation hover around the 2% mark. A study of any of the six disciplines cited by Haldane would show that this is not the way the world really works. In the short term, growth could easily be higher than the consensus because the behaviour of consumers and firms is affected by what others do and think. Increases in confidence become self-reinforcing. But the mood can change quickly, especially if the model is biologically unsound. So how healthy is the UK economy? The first thing to note is that the lion's share of the growth since the trough reached in 2009 has been the result of a rising population. Dhaval Joshi, economist with BCA Research, noted recently that gross domestic product had risen by 7% since the recession ended, but the UK's population had grown by 5%. There is, he says, a simple explanation why people feel no better off despite the pick up in gross domestic product: based on GDP per head, they are no better off. The second thing to note is that the UK has a twin deficit problem. Although the budget deficit has come down from the record peacetime level of 11% of GDP reached after the financial crisis, it is still more than \u00a3100bn a year \u2013 more than 5% of GDP. The current account deficit \u2013 trade plus investment income plus payments to international bodies \u2013 is of a similar size. The last time the UK had a current account deficit of more than 5% of GDP was in the late 1980s, when the Lawson boom was about to collapse. At that point, though, years of strong growth had left the public finances in the black and there was scope to let the public finances take the strain when the economy weakened. If the current surge in activity does prove to be short-lived, it will be no good looking to the Treasury for a fiscal boost. Instead, it will again be up to the Bank of England to keep the economy moving. The final thing to note is a point raised by Wolfgang Streeck, sociology professor at Cologne University. Streeck's new book, Buying Time, argues that ever since the 1970s, governments in the west have been \"buying time\" for the existing social and political order. \"This they achieved by generating mass allegiance to the neoliberal social project, first through inflation of the money supply, then through an accumulation of public debt and finally through lavish credit to private households.\" Seen in this light, more time has now been bought by ultra-low interest rates and quantitative easing. Lower inflation has also provided a short-term boost because it has meant that even squeezed pay packets go a bit further. The counter to Streeck's argument is that capitalism is endlessly creative and finds way not just of reinventing itself, but also of adapting to cultural and social norms. The US variant, for example, is different from the German variant. But the idea that the British model is structurally weak, currently only regularly delivers for a small elite, and is running out of road is a timely corrective to the self-congratulatory hype likely in the coming days.",

      "bodyText": "The director of CBI Scotland, Iain McMillan, has announced he is retiring after the independence referendum in the wake of the organisation's disastrous registration as a no campaigner. McMillan revealed on Saturday that he planned to retire less than a day after the CBI revealed it wanted to reverse a decision to formally register as a no campaigner with the Electoral Commission. The CBI said McMillan's retirement later this year, and before his 65th birthday, had been agreed in January and had no connection to the referendum registration row. Amid speculation that McMillan's decision to stand down was directly linked to the furore, the CBI said: \"McMillan signalled his intention to retire early two years ago. He agreed a timetable for his departure with our HR team in January and is planning to retire towards the end of 2014.\" Business for Scotland, the pro-independence campaign that has led attacks against the CBI, said it believed McMillan was a scapegoat for decisions taken by the CBI in London and called on John Cridland, the organisation's director general, to resign. Admitting it had deeply damaged the CBI's reputation, Cridland blamed the registration decision on a junior member of staff in its London office. The decision had not been properly authorised under the CBI's rules or by its ruling council, he said. \"An official in our London office signed what he thought was a regulatory compliance necessary to deal with the CBI's expenditures on things like our events and our dinners,\" Cridland told the BBC on Friday. \"But actually, of course, it opened a Pandora's box of unintended consequences.\" Cridland said the CBI had fresh legal advice that said it was not necessary for the business lobby group to register after all; it had also promised the Electoral Commission it would play no active part in the referendum. The commission acknowledged last week it had played a major role in the CBI's decision to register after Business for Scotland had claimed the credit for forcing the CBI to do so. The commission had been in touch with the CBI last year, as it has with dozens of groups on both sides of the debate, to warn that its public statements opposing independence could bring it within the ambit of the Scottish Referendum Act. The act requires any group spending \u00a310,000 or more on referendum-linked events or campaigns to register with the commission and submit spending returns. But the decision provoked a backlash, with 18 CBI members, including many of Scotland's most prestigious universities, six Scottish government quangos and the broadcaster STV resigning to preserve their neutrality. The Law Society of Scotland also stood down. On Thursday, the BBC at UK level said it had agreed with the CBI to suspend its membership for the 16-week official referendum campaign. Tony Banks, the chairman of Business for Scotland and a pro-independence campaigner whose care home company, Balhousie Care, was the first firm to resign from the CBI after the registration decision emerged. He said Cridland's role in the matter was crucial. \"The news that Mr McMillan will soon be departing from CBI Scotland comes as no surprise. His silence during the last week speaks volumes,\" Banks said. \"However, it does beg some questions about the main driver behind the CBI's response to the Scottish government's white paper [on independence]. \"That was headed up by the director general, John Cridland, who was responsible for the composition and media promotion of what was clearly a highly politicised act of no-campaigning. \"Mr McMillan's retirement as director in Scotland may suggest to some people an element of scapegoating to distract from the central CBI figure, Director General John Cridland.
