      "bodyText": "Who will guard the guards?, asked the Roman poet Juvenal. (Quis custodiet ipsos custodes?) The perennial question raises its head once again as a result of a remarkable public intervention by the chancellor of the exchequer last week. The background needs some explanation. When Gordon Brown became chancellor in 1997, he gave the Bank of England responsibility for setting interest rates but punished the Old Lady for its sporadically lax supervision of banks over the years: that responsibility was transferred to the Financial Services Authority. Then, hey presto!, along came George Osborne in 2010, and responsibility for banking supervision was restored to the Bank because \u2013 you have guessed it \u2013 the Financial Services Authority was being punished for its lax supervision of the banks. Osborne's other bright idea was to abolish the FSA completely and set up the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) as a much-needed watchdog to protect the public from a financial services \"industry\" that has not distinguished itself \u2013 a function that previously also lay with the FSA. But last week the chancellor publicly censured his \"independent\" financial regulator, the FCA, for what the Financial Times neatly summarised as \"its botched disclosure of a market-sensitive probe\", which led to panic selling of shares in insurance companies that might be affected by the said \"probe\". This caused the FT, which to my mind is normally far too friendly towards the chancellor, to censure him in turn. So how independent is the FCA? It may be guarding consumers, but it is in turn being guarded by the chancellor. One should not really be surprised by this. It is a commonplace in Westminster and Whitehall that in Osborne we have a most political chancellor \u2013 indeed, there are some who say, as they used to of Gordon Brown and Tony Blair, that it is the chancellor who is effectively the day-to-day prime minister. Why, Osborne sometimes gives the impression that he is on a zero-hours contract with his own department. However, last week was different. The chancellor was popping up all over the place. In addition to his public rebuke to the chairman of the FCA, one day he was in front of the Treasury committee, defending the dubious arithmetic behind his very political budget; another day he was surprising us all by announcing that he was aiming at \"full employment\". Well, it was a surprise until we read the details. For those of us of a certain generation, the days of an economic policy that aimed at full employment seem, and are, decades away. During what are now looked back upon as the golden days of the 1950s, unemployment would be a mere 1-2% of the workforce. Indeed, the great Cambridge economist and colleague of Keynes, Richard Kahn, used to be vicious in his attacks on a certain Professor Frank Paish, of the London School of Economics, for advocating 2.5% as the ideal rate of unemployment consistent with controlling wage inflation. The rate at present is just over 7%. Ever since Mark Carney arrived at the Bank of England and unveiled his policy of what I am tempted to call \"forward misguidance\", the financial markets have been obsessed with when the Bank of England will decide to raise interest rates. Carney has admitted \u2013 he had no alternative \u2013 that unemployment has so far fallen faster than he expected. But he has also gone out of his way to emphasise that he never regarded 7% as the significant level for policy tightening, even if some analysts had got this impression. The Bank regards what it terms \"the medium-term equilibrium rate\" of unemployment as 6-6.5%. The budgetary watchdog, the OBR, judges that \"the long-term structural unemployment rate\" is around 5.25%. The difference seems to be that the Bank fears pressures on wage inflation before many of the long-term unemployed return to work. In classic mandarin, the OBR regards its own and the Bank's assessments as \"broadly consistent\". Last week the governor reiterated that there was \"still slack in the labour market\" and interest rates would not rise until the economy was performing closer to full capacity. It turns out that when the chancellor talks about the goal of \"full employment\" he means that there would be more people in jobs here than in any other G7 country. That strikes me as a pretty fishy definition. Also, he appears to be counting the many people who are now in part-time jobs, or defined as \"self-employed\", in his definition. You see the sleight of hand? He will count partly employed people as one constituent of his \"full employment\" definition. The background briefing, by the way, has it that, in focusing on his eccentric definition of \"full\" employment, the chancellor is attempting to divert attention from his repeated failure to meet his other economic targets, not least those for economic growth and deficit reduction. The OBR is punctilious in charting the course of the chancellor's, and its own, revisions. But we have not yet reached the stage where, as in George Orwell's Nineteen Eighty-Four, the records are routinely altered so that Big Brother's forecasts always turn out to have been right.",

    "fields": {
      "standfirst": "Questions need to be asked about the regulator's botched announcement of its pensions review. But this is an industry with precious little moral high ground on which to stand", 
      "body": "<p>Two years ago, Martin Wheatley told insurance and pension companies that his new get-tough Financial Conduct Authority would \"shoot first and ask questions later\". But it's Wheatley who is now dodging bullets, fired by the very industry he set out to reform. One of them may yet be&#xa0;fatal.</p> <p>A quoted company can't selectively release information, say to mates of the chief executive, but must give it to the whole market. It can't spread misinformation. If it sees a false market in its shares, it must act immediately to correct the facts. When the FCA briefed the <em>Daily Telegraph</em> about its proposed inquiry into the pensions industry \u2013 and prompted a \u00a33bn rout of insurance company shares \u2013 the regulator fell foul of one, or arguably all, of these golden rules.</p> <p>If reports are to be believed, some of the City's biggest investors have consulted a leading law firm over the potential for compensation. But that's part of the problem \u2013 \"if reports are to be believed\". The market believed the <em>Telegraph's</em> report, and marked down insurance company shares dramatically. Subsequently there was much speculation about what Clive Adamson, the FCA's director of supervision, did or did not say in his briefing. But questions about the journalistic process, while interesting, are not especially relevant. It doesn't matter whether the story was right or wrong; what mattered was what the FCA did in the immediate aftermath.</p> <p>PRs are experts at \"killing\" stories. The regulator would have been aware, late that Thursday night, that a front-page story was coming. You don't have to be a sleuth to find out \u2013 most newspapers now publish their next-day stories online before midnight, and often hours earlier.</p> <p>Maybe the FCA did, naively, believe when it briefed the <em>Telegraph</em> that the information would not be market-sensitive, but by midnight it should surely have dawned on them. Why, then, did it take so long for the regulator to calm markets with its clarification, issued hours after the stock exchange opened?</p> <p>Now take a further step back. Why was the FCA engaged in briefing just one paper on an announcement of such potentially far-reaching impact? A regulator should be guarded, proportionate and reasoned when communicating something as important as its supervisory strategy for the year ahead. In dishing out exclusives, it turned itself from gamekeeper into poacher. Adamson, already under pressure as the regulator who authorised the appointment of the now-disgraced Paul Flowers to the board of Co-op Bank, may find his position untenable.</p> <p>But in baying for blood, the \"City investors\" seeking legal retribution are guilty of breathtaking hypocrisy. Over the past two decades we have seen billions in compensation paid out for the mis-selling of personal pensions, mortgage endowments and payment protection insurance. How many bank or insurance company chief executives have walked the plank as a result? None. Now the who-said-what-to-whom game has disguised, to the pension industry's delight, the very real problem of the exit charges faced by savers. It's not uncommon in some old-style pension contracts for savers to lose 10% of their cash should they audaciously attempt to move it, which is why so few ever do. The chances of those penalties being removed now appear slim.</p> <p>Will the FCA really face prosecution and multimillion-pound fines like those it has meted out in recent weeks, such as the \u00a312m against Santander only a fortnight ago? Experts believe the immunities enjoyed by regulators will place the bar very high, although a prosecution on grounds of recklessness might possibly see the light of day.</p> <p>And if the industry is seeking revenge, it should be careful what it wishes for. The FCA survives entirely on the annual levy it imposes on its members \u2013 financial firms. If the industry engages in a legal battle against its regulator, the costs will rebound on the companies whatever the result.</p> <h2>Heathrow needs a flashier pilot now</h2> <p>Rigorous, tightly controlled and rather unexciting, the Heathrow chief executive Colin Matthews embodied in his personal qualities everything that passengers expected of Britain's biggest airport itself. Apart from the 2010 snow fiasco that should have cost him his job, he kept Heathrow out of the headlines and got the airport working again after standards collapsed in the wake of Ferrovial's takeover in 2006.</p> <p>So Matthews will walk away this summer \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/apr/01/heathrow-airport-colin-matthews-resigns-terminal-5\" title=\"\">having announced his departure last week</a> \u2013 with deserved plaudits, led by the 75% of passengers who now rate the Heathrow experience as good or excellent.</p> <p>But Matthews's operational success has made him the wrong person for the next phase of the job \u2013 not least for the sovereign wealth funds who control the business and want the best possible return. And that means a third or fourth runway.</p> <p>Matthews brought his mastery of detail to the expansion debate, but when combined with that metronomic rigour it gave the impression that he had been making the same argument for six years. Heathrow's contribution has run on autopilot. The airport's owners needs a leader who can persuade the public \u2013 particularly in west London \u2013 as well as the three main political parties, that a new runway is in Britain's best interests. This will require showmanship.</p> <p>The independent airports commission has already gone some way to giving a post-2015 government the political cover for a <em>volte face</em> on expansion, which will be a considerable turnaround given that the main parties are opposed to a new runway. With many west Londoners in marginal constituencies unlikely to ever be won over by the case for a bigger Heathrow, ministers and opposition leaders will need persuading that the political cost is worth it. So the new Heathrow chief executive will need charm and political nous, as well as the ability to keep an eye on an operation that, when it goes wrong, is instantly rebranded as one of Britain's most derided institutions. Energy bosses need not apply.</p> <h2>Digby Jones's troubleshooting record deserves scrutiny</h2> <p>Here's a tip for Digby Jones, Lord Jones of Birmingham, who will grace our screens as BBC2's <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b040tmm9\" title=\"\"><em>The New Troubleshooter</em></a> on Thursday: in order to shoot trouble, you first need to be able to spot it. You won't find this on Jones's expansive website, but he was formerly director of NHS software provider <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/isoft\" title=\"\">iSoft</a>, which in the early 2000s appeared to be one of Britain's brightest tech success stories, a stock market darling which was rocketing to a market value of \u00a31bn. Unfortunately, the company had been cooking the books. Exactly who was behind the creative accounting was never determined after a prosecution attempt by the watchdog was botched. That there had been a fraud was never in dispute.</p> <p>Jones was certainly not to blame and he appeared as a prosecution witness.

      "bodyText": "Two years ago, Martin Wheatley told insurance and pension companies that his new get-tough Financial Conduct Authority would \"shoot first and ask questions later\". But it's Wheatley who is now dodging bullets, fired by the very industry he set out to reform. One of them may yet be fatal. A quoted company can't selectively release information, say to mates of the chief executive, but must give it to the whole market. It can't spread misinformation. If it sees a false market in its shares, it must act immediately to correct the facts. When the FCA briefed the Daily Telegraph about its proposed inquiry into the pensions industry \u2013 and prompted a \u00a33bn rout of insurance company shares \u2013 the regulator fell foul of one, or arguably all, of these golden rules. If reports are to be believed, some of the City's biggest investors have consulted a leading law firm over the potential for compensation. But that's part of the problem \u2013 \"if reports are to be believed\". The market believed the Telegraph's report, and marked down insurance company shares dramatically. Subsequently there was much speculation about what Clive Adamson, the FCA's director of supervision, did or did not say in his briefing. But questions about the journalistic process, while interesting, are not especially relevant. It doesn't matter whether the story was right or wrong; what mattered was what the FCA did in the immediate aftermath. PRs are experts at \"killing\" stories. The regulator would have been aware, late that Thursday night, that a front-page story was coming. You don't have to be a sleuth to find out \u2013 most newspapers now publish their next-day stories online before midnight, and often hours earlier. Maybe the FCA did, naively, believe when it briefed the Telegraph that the information would not be market-sensitive, but by midnight it should surely have dawned on them. Why, then, did it take so long for the regulator to calm markets with its clarification, issued hours after the stock exchange opened? Now take a further step back. Why was the FCA engaged in briefing just one paper on an announcement of such potentially far-reaching impact? A regulator should be guarded, proportionate and reasoned when communicating something as important as its supervisory strategy for the year ahead. In dishing out exclusives, it turned itself from gamekeeper into poacher. Adamson, already under pressure as the regulator who authorised the appointment of the now-disgraced Paul Flowers to the board of Co-op Bank, may find his position untenable. But in baying for blood, the \"City investors\" seeking legal retribution are guilty of breathtaking hypocrisy. Over the past two decades we have seen billions in compensation paid out for the mis-selling of personal pensions, mortgage endowments and payment protection insurance. How many bank or insurance company chief executives have walked the plank as a result? None. Now the who-said-what-to-whom game has disguised, to the pension industry's delight, the very real problem of the exit charges faced by savers. It's not uncommon in some old-style pension contracts for savers to lose 10% of their cash should they audaciously attempt to move it, which is why so few ever do. The chances of those penalties being removed now appear slim. Will the FCA really face prosecution and multimillion-pound fines like those it has meted out in recent weeks, such as the \u00a312m against Santander only a fortnight ago? Experts believe the immunities enjoyed by regulators will place the bar very high, although a prosecution on grounds of recklessness might possibly see the light of day. And if the industry is seeking revenge, it should be careful what it wishes for. The FCA survives entirely on the annual levy it imposes on its members \u2013 financial firms. If the industry engages in a legal battle against its regulator, the costs will rebound on the companies whatever the result. Heathrow needs a flashier pilot now Rigorous, tightly controlled and rather unexciting, the Heathrow chief executive Colin Matthews embodied in his personal qualities everything that passengers expected of Britain's biggest airport itself. Apart from the 2010 snow fiasco that should have cost him his job, he kept Heathrow out of the headlines and got the airport working again after standards collapsed in the wake of Ferrovial's takeover in 2006. So Matthews will walk away this summer \u2013 having announced his departure last week \u2013 with deserved plaudits, led by the 75% of passengers who now rate the Heathrow experience as good or excellent. But Matthews's operational success has made him the wrong person for the next phase of the job \u2013 not least for the sovereign wealth funds who control the business and want the best possible return. And that means a third or fourth runway. Matthews brought his mastery of detail to the expansion debate, but when combined with that metronomic rigour it gave the impression that he had been making the same argument for six years. Heathrow's contribution has run on autopilot. The airport's owners needs a leader who can persuade the public \u2013 particularly in west London \u2013 as well as the three main political parties, that a new runway is in Britain's best interests. This will require showmanship. The independent airports commission has already gone some way to giving a post-2015 government the political cover for a volte face on expansion, which will be a considerable turnaround given that the main parties are opposed to a new runway. With many west Londoners in marginal constituencies unlikely to ever be won over by the case for a bigger Heathrow, ministers and opposition leaders will need persuading that the political cost is worth it. So the new Heathrow chief executive will need charm and political nous, as well as the ability to keep an eye on an operation that, when it goes wrong, is instantly rebranded as one of Britain's most derided institutions. Energy bosses need not apply. Digby Jones's troubleshooting record deserves scrutiny Here's a tip for Digby Jones, Lord Jones of Birmingham, who will grace our screens as BBC2's The New Troubleshooter on Thursday: in order to shoot trouble, you first need to be able to spot it. You won't find this on Jones's expansive website, but he was formerly director of NHS software provider iSoft, which in the early 2000s appeared to be one of Britain's brightest tech success stories, a stock market darling which was rocketing to a market value of \u00a31bn. Unfortunately, the company had been cooking the books. Exactly who was behind the creative accounting was never determined after a prosecution attempt by the watchdog was botched. That there had been a fraud was never in dispute. Jones was certainly not to blame and he appeared as a prosecution witness. Since then he has repeatedly insisted non-executives can't be blamed if they are lied to. That is not good enough. Last year, a damning report by accountancy regulators at the Financial Reporting Council was unsealed. It revealed that iSoft's auditors had simply not been doing their checks properly in 2003 and 2004, specifically in the area of \"revenue recognition\", where the iSoft abuses lay. Jones had been an iSoft audit committee member \u2013 but he hadn't spotted trouble brewing. He hadn't even spotted it when, in 2004, a Guardian investigation raised specific revenue-recognition concerns. \"Serious and unfounded insinuations of impropriety\" was how he put it. Meanwhile, others at iSoft rushed to the courts to get a gagging order blocking the Guardian from publication. Jones expressly insisted he had looked into Guardian allegations, and that they were entirely without foundation.",

      "bodyText": "Light travels at 186,000 miles a second in a vacuum, which is another way of saying that it covers 186 miles in a milli-second \u2013 a thousandth of a second. Given that much of our contemporary electronic communications are conveyed by pulses of light travelling along fibreoptic cables, we are given to extravagant hyperbole about the \"death of distance\". After all, if a message \u2013 or a file \u2013 can traverse the globe in the blink of an eye, it doesn't matter whether your hard drive is on your desktop or in a server farm in Nebraska or Sweden. But it turns out that the speed of light is of great practical interest to some people. One group of them have shelled out $300m to lay a fibreoptic cable in a straight line from Chicago to New York. This involves, among other things, drilling through mountains and under urban areas. And for what? So that the time taken to send a signal between New York and Chicago could be reduced from 17 milliseconds to 13. For that apparently infinitesimal improvement, stock market traders were willing to pay $14m a year, plus a substantial upfront payment, to use the cable. Therein lies the tale of Michael Lewis's enthralling new book, Flash Boys, which joins an elite but growing list of volumes that set out to explain how computing is reshaping our world. For it turns out that for people armed with the right kit, software and networking skills, an advantage of a few milliseconds is enough to let them turn a $14m annual subscription into annual profits of $20bn. These people are called high-frequency traders \u2013 \"high-frequency\" because they are incredibly active (they submit almost 99% of the orders on US stock markets) and buy and sell shares in milliseconds. They are not really \"traders\" in any normal sense of the term, but software algorithms, and they now dominate the most important stock markets in the capitalist world. Most of us knew that, sort of. We knew about computerised trading and probably naively assumed that it was more efficient than the old system of guys in coloured jackets bellowing at one another on the floor of an exchange. Well, it is more efficient \u2013 for some. But the significance of Lewis's book is that it explains in user-friendly terms how the colossal profits of high-frequency traders really amount to an unconscionable tax on the ordinary investor, or at any rate on the pension funds and other financial institutions on which our livelihoods depend. Flash Boys follows the usual Lewis formula: find a scandalous situation that is too arcane for most people to comprehend; locate some smart guys (they are usually male) who have spotted the scam and plan to do something with or about it; and tell their story. In his earlier book The Big Short, Lewis focused on the smallish group of shrewd investors who understood that the sub-prime mortgage boom was sure to go bust and bet against it. In his new book, the white hat is worn by Brad Katsuyama, a Royal Bank of Canada trader who discovered the extent to which high-frequency traders were skewing the stock market and screwing investors and, in the end, set up a new stock exchange (IEX) designed to level the playing field by making sure everyone's trading instructions arrived at the same time. But the most interesting thing about Flash Boys is what it reveals about the networked world into which we have stumbled. Once upon a time the New York stock exchange was a place; now it's a set of more than a dozen \"stock exchanges\" scattered around New York and New Jersey. But these exchanges are not places either: they are server farms, air-conditioned warehouses filled with rack-mounted computers, complete with blinking lights and whirring discs. So the stock market has become a virtual space \u2013 an interactive, computer-driven system of staggering complexity. And it turns out that there are several sides to this complexity: for the banks and the high-frequency traders who exploit it, it's a marketing tool for bamboozling investors and a means of intimidating regulators; and for smart programmers and entrepreneurs it offers limitless opportunities to play the system. \"From the point of view of the most sophisticated traders,\" Lewis writes, \"the stock market wasn't a mechanism for channelling capital to productive enterprise but a puzzle to be solved.\" For society, the system's complexity is dangerous, because complex systems are intrinsically unpredictable and nobody really understands this one as a whole \u2013 which means that catastrophic failure is always a remote but finite possibility. At first sight, the modus operandi of high-frequency traders seems so outrageous that one assumes it must be illegal. In its review, the Economist came up with a useful everyday analogy: high-frequency traders are like \"the people who offer you tasty titbits as you enter the supermarket to entice you to buy; but in this case, as you show appreciation for the goods, they race through the aisles to mark the price up before you can get your trolley to the chosen counter\". How, one wonders, can it be legal for a handful of insiders to operate at faster speeds than the rest of the market and, in effect, steal from investors? But it is legal, and for an interesting reason. In 2004 the US Securities and Exchange Commission discovered that some traders in the old New York stock exchange were exploiting the discretion then allowed to them in choosing the time to execute a deal. The following year the SEC passed a new regulation, known as Reg NMS, which obliged traders to seek \"the best price\" for a security. What the SEC did not anticipate was that in the new fragmented system of a dozen virtual exchanges, this provided the opportunity for high-frequency traders to outrun the market while staying within the law. Reg NMS was a well-intentioned measure to restore equality of opportunity in the US stock market. But instead, as Lewis points out, \"it institutionalised a more pernicious inequality. A small class of insiders with the resources to create speed were now allowed to preview the market and trade on what they had seen.\" This is a good illustration of one of the central problems that society will have to address in the coming decades: the collision between analogue mindsets and digital realities. Software is pure \"thought-stuff\". The only resource needed to produce it is human intelligence and expertise. This has two implications. The first is that attempting to regulate the things that it creates is like trying to catch quicksilver using a butterfly net. The Edward Snowden disclosures about the US National Security Agency have revealed how difficult it is to bring this stuff under effective democratic control. Lewis's account of how high-frequency trader geeks have run rings around the regulators suggests that much the same holds true in civilian life. This technology can easily run out of control. The second implication is that what one might call the politics of expertise will become much more important. Mastery of these technologies confers enormous power on those who have it. Sed quis custodiet ipsos custodes and all that. So in addition to wondering who will guard the guardians, we may have to start thinking about who is going to guard the geeks.",

Last year, the Pew Research Centre, an independent thinktank, reported that people under 30 were now reading more books than they were 10 years ago, and in more formats than ever before. We know this anecdotally, from experience. Step on to any bus, plane or train. A majority will be engrossed in the written word, in some form. Set aside our attachment to the aesthetic experience of the bound book, and this can quickly become less a vision of hell than a surprisingly encouraging picture: a world of living words, transmitted to readers everywhere. Far from celebrating, however, many readers, finding themselves in the middle of dislocating change, seem more baffled than enlightened. We can get access to information about absolutely everything, but the facility remains disabling. We have the knowledge. But we are slow to engage with it in a productive way. As George Orwell, writing in the Observer, once put it: \"To see what is in front of one's nose needs a constant struggle.\" Talk of the future, and some commentators will frame it as a struggle between old and new, print and digital, between ink and chips, so to speak. Break out of that matrix, and the talk about the importance of \"digital platforms\" becomes less intimidating. One landmark we can find in this storm of change is the certainty of \"content\". It's what, not how, you're reading that matters. From this derives one intriguing possible outcome. If the next generation of Amazon managers, weary of distribution's nuts and bolts, got interested in exercising some cultural muscle, it's possible they might put some of their colossal resources to the service of a new publishing model. Far-fetched? Not really. Book publishing began with bookselling. Amazon could equal Penguin Random House Redux.",
