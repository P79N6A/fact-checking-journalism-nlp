      "bodyText": "There are signs that the booming UK housing market could be cooling, with two sets of data showing a slowdown in demand from buyers in May. The Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (Rics) said the number of new inquiries from househunters had fallen to its slowest pace since February 2013, while the number of homes coming on to the market had contracted for the fifth month running. Meanwhile figures from the UK's largest surveyor, e.surv, showed the number of house purchase loans fell to their lowest level for 11 months. House prices rose to a record high in May, according to Nationwide Building Society's latest snapshot of the market, and Rics said higher prices, together with a lack of homes for sale and the introduction of restrictions on mortgage lending, had deterred new buyers from entering the market. In recent months London has been powering the housing market, with some parts of the capital recording double-digit price rises, but Rics said demand from new buyers was starting to subside. Inquiries from new buyers fell in May for the first time since January last year and more surveyors reported a fall in numbers than a rise for the first time in almost two years. At the same time, the number of sales agreed remained flat in the capital and the rest of the south-east. Buyer inquiries were also down in the north of England and East Anglia, and Rics said there were some early signs that concerns over both supply and finance could be influencing the outlook elsewhere in the country. In the south-east, the proportion of surveyors expecting more sales over the next three months had fallen to 29% from 66% six months ago, while in the south-west it had dropped to 48% from 93%. Surveyors who had been predicting that London would see price increases of 9% a year over the next five years had revised that down to just under 5%, while on a national level the forecast has edged down to 5%. \"Given the relationship between new buyer inquiries and new instructions on the one hand, and house price inflation on the other, this signals a slowdown in the latter over the next six to 12 months,\" it said. The report, which comes days before the Bank of England's Financial Policy Committee (FPC) meets to discuss the UK housing market amid concerns of runaway price growth, suggested that mortgage lending rules that came into force in April have had a dampening effect on the market. The changes, brought in under the mortgage market review, mean lenders have to undertake strict affordability checks before offering loans and Rics said anecdotal evidence suggested there had been a tightening in underwriting standards as a result. Respondents to the survey suggested average loan-to-values among first-time buyers had dropped to 85.3% from 86% in April. Rics' chief economist, Simon Rubinsohn, said: \"What we are really seeing is some of the very strong upward momentum starting to come off the housing market, as a lack of supply, higher prices, more prudent lending measures and some of the talk from the Bank of England are creating a level of caution among sellers and buyers. \"The most visible indicators of this are the revised downwards price expectations for the next 12 months and the flatter picture regarding new buyer enquiries. In particular, we're seeing the London market level off.\" E.surv's figures, which are based on mortgage valuations it has undertaken and published data from lenders, showed a 3% fall in house purchase loans in May, despite a rise in the number of first-time buyers. There were 61,202 house purchase approvals during the month \u2013 the lowest number since June 2013. However, first-time buyer numbers were up, and the number of loans to borrowers with a deposit of 15% or less was up by 40% year-on-year at 9,670. Matthew Pointon, property economist at Capital Economics, said there were signs that demand from buyers was \"beginning to lose steam \u2026 but that's not to say the housing market is grinding to a halt\". Pointon added: \"While the level of lending has dropped, there is no sign as yet that loan-to-income ratios are coming down from record highs. \"So while signs that the market is cooling could persuade the FPC to delay taking any action, we suspect they will act to at least stabilise loan-to-income ratios, probably by toughening up the interest-rate stress test.\"",

      "bodyText": "Rigging the foreign exchange, bond and commodity markets could become a criminal offence, the government will warn the City on Thursday as part of its latest effort to clean up the financial markets after a wave of scandals and allegations relating to key benchmarks. Criminal offences for manipulating these global markets, which are based in London, will be among measures considered in a year-long review being launched by the chancellor, which was immediately criticised by Labour for being too late. It follows steps in 2012 to allow prison sentences of up to seven years for anyone involved in rigging the key interest rate benchmark Libor. George Osborne is expected to say in his Mansion House speech: \"The integrity of the City matters to the economy of Britain. \"Markets here set the interest rates for people's mortgages, the exchange rates for our exports and holidays, and the commodity prices for the goods we buy. I am going to deal with abuses, tackle the unacceptable behaviour of the few and ensure that markets are fair for the many who depend on them.\" A European directive published in February set out rules for making abuse of such markets a criminal offence, but Osborne intends to opt out of this directive \u2013 a move a Treasury source insisted was not intended to delay the implementation of possible prison sentences but to give the UK the ability to bring in new rules more quickly than the EU's 2016 deadline. The chancellor is asking the new deputy governor of the Bank of England, Minouche Shafik, to lead the review of \"fair and effective markets along with Martin Wheatley, the boss of the Financial Conduct Authority who led a review into Libor rigging, and Charles Roxburgh, the director general of financial services at the Treasury. But any tougher regime will take time to implement as the review will not be completed until after the general election and a consultation on the review will not begin until the autumn. Cathy Jamieson MP, the shadow financial secretary, said: \"This review is too little, too late. We pressed ministers to regulate commodities markets and the full array of financial benchmarks back in 2012, but the chancellor failed to act.\" The Libor-rigging scandal, blown open in June 2012 when Barclays was fined \u00a3290m by regulators in the UK and US, prompted scrutiny of other benchmarks used to price financial products and has led to investigations into the \u00a33tn-a-day currency markets as well as an analysis of gold pricing. The chancellor signalled his intention to target foreign exchange markets \u2013 already under investigation by regulators in the UK and abroad \u2013 at a conference last week, when he said he had to ensure the UK was \"bolstering the integrity of the London markets\". A panel of market users is also being set up to contribute to the new review. The chancellor will be speaking alongside the Bank's governor, Mark Carney, who last month warned that capitalism could destroy itself and criticised bankers' adoption of a \"heads I win, tails you lose\" system. The global Financial Stability Board, chaired by Carney, is working on ways to bolster the forex markets, which trade 24 hours a day but rely on a daily \"fix\" at 4pm. The Bank has called in Anthony Grabiner, a leading QC, to look into whether its staff condoned manipulation of the markets. Osborne also intends to consult on extending one of the recommendations of the parliamentary commission on banking standards, chaired by the Conservative MP Andrew Tyrie and set up after the Barclays fine, for new regimes governing senior managers and the certification of top bankers. This could be extended to foreign bankers with branches in the UK.",

      "bodyText": "Outgoing Sainsbury's boss Justin King revealed a second quarter of falling sales but insisted he is \"not leaving on a low\" because the grocer is still outperforming its rivals. In King's last trading update before he quits next month, Sainsbury's said sales at stores open a year or more were down 1.1%, excluding fuel, in the last three months. The widely anticipated sales fall follows a decline in the previous three months which broke a nine-year unbroken record of growth. Last week Tesco unveiled a 3.8% plunge in recent sales \u2013 its worst performance in three decades. Like other major supermarkets, Sainsbury's has been hit by increasing competition from budget grocers Aldi and Lidl and a general slowdown in the grocery market as cash-strapped shoppers keep a tight rein on their weekly grocery bill. King said Sainsbury's underlying sales had been hit as a result of going \"toe-to-toe\" with rivals on prices of basic foods such as bread and milk. At the same time the price of fruit and vegetables had come down because of good harvests compared with last year. Sainsbury's has steered clear of the eye-catching price cutting campaigns used by rivals Morrisons, Asda and Tesco, but King insisted the retailer was not being left behind. \"We have the strongest price position in a very long time,\" King said. \"I'd have preferred sales to be growing but I'm not leaving on a low. Total sales are growing and we delivered a performance in the context of a market that is growing at the lowest level in 10 years. Our outperformance if anything was a bit stronger in the last quarter than it has been in a while.\" Unlike listed competitors Tesco and Morrisons, which have warned of sales declines, Sainsbury's expects to see a slight lift in underlying sales this year of about 0.2%. But it was less confident on profits. Finance director John Rogers admitted that the very broad spread of analysts' expectations, which range from \u00a3571m to \u00a3871m \u2013 compared with \u00a3798m last year \u2013 appropriately reflected \"uncertainty in the market given what could happen in the coming months\". Analysts and even Sainsbury's seem unsure about the likely extent of a price war and how much this will cost the supermarket this year. King said Sainsbury's was likely to shout more about its lower prices in future as analysts said it had the most to lose if bigger rival Tesco cut prices more aggressively. Mike Coupe, who takes over from King on 9 July, said Sainsbury's would not be changing its \"underlying principles\" which were based on \"great prices, great quality and closely adhered-to values which set apart our proposition.\" Sainsbury's total sales rose 1% as it opened 27 convenience stores to meet changing shopping habits as customers opt for more frequent but smaller purchases instead of visiting out-of-town stores. Sales from the small Sainsbury's Local shops rose 18% while online sales of groceries increased 10% and strong non-food sales helped to offset a decline in groceries. Clothing like-for-like sales were up by a \"double-digit\" figure, Sainsbury's said. But analysts pointed out that Sainsbury's large stores, which form the core of the business, were seeing underlying sales fall by more than 3% despite the company spending \u00a31bn on refurbishing, opening or extending stores last year. Dave McCarthy at HSBC said shoppers were more enticed by low prices than they were by glamorous-looking stores or the internet and all the major retailers needed to invest more in price cuts. \"Aldi's market share alone is growing faster than Sainsbury, Tesco, Morrisons, Asda, Waitrose and Ocado combined are winning on the internet,\" he said. King said Aldi and Lidl's success was as much to do with the fact that they were opening more handy local stores as it was price. But Bryan Roberts, director of retail insights at consultancy Kantar Retail, said: \"With Tesco desperately seeking recovery and the Co-op poised to raise its game, Sainsbury's could face further pressure in the coming months and quarters. If Sainsbury's has any decent strategic aces up its sleeve, now might be the time to play them.\"",

In the face of widespread outrage, Starbucks pointed out that its tax affairs had been approved by HMRC, it also told MPs the group had legitimately secured a tax deal with the Netherlands that gave \"a very low tax rate\".

The big unknown is what happens if the current price competition among the mainstream supermarkets, which King is probably right to characterise as merely a skirmish, turns into the real deal. If Tesco is ever minded to hit the panic button and launch a proper price war, the moment is probably at least a year away, so Coupe has time to play himself in. But there is a good reason why City forecasts for Sainsbury's profits in the next couple of years are all over the shop.

Our news story about the UK unemployment rate falling to just 6.6% in the three months to April is here: UK employment surges but wages lag behind inflation Live coverage of the announcement starts here There are charts here... ...and key points from the ONS are here. Thanks, and goodnight. GW And here's Nick Fletcher's closing market report: Escalating geopolitical tensions in Iraq, and the World Bank's warning that global growth will be slower than expected, combined to send European stock markets down tonight. This morning's profit warning from Germany's Lufthansa also hit airline shares across the region. The main indices have all closed in the red, with losses in London, Paris, Frankfurt, Milan and Madrid. The big faller in the City was Rolls-Royce, down 5.5% after Emirates cancelled a contract for new Airbus planes which use its engines. FTSE 100: down 34 points at 6838, -0.5% German DAX: down 78 points at 9949, -0.8% French CAC: down 39 points at 4555, -0.9% Spanish IBEX: down 78 points at 11074, -0.7% Italian FTSE MIB: down 279 points at 22223, -1.24% Chris Beauchamp, market analyst at IG, reckons the Footsie is unlikely to hit its new record high anytime soon: It is becoming increasingly difficult to believe that this market will see 6930 in the near future, having begun to inexorably falter the closer it gets to 6880. Previous guarded bullishness has given way to increased caution, making it increasingly likely that we see a retest of 6800. A reminder of the main story of the day -- the drop in UK unemployment rate to 6.6% in the three months to April. As this chart shows, it's a five-year low: Scroll back to 9.30am onwards for full coverage and reaction Broadbent also played down a report that the Bank of England had thrown out its assessment of spare capacity in the labour market in favour of a new, more dovish model, because the original one showed there was no slack left. A lot of things that journalists say that would be troubling if true, usually aren't, he muttered. However, he then added that the Bank was always reviewing its models to ensure they work as well as possible.... Do you think the recent falls in unemployment will continue? That's what's in our forecast, Broadbent replies, conceding that \"our forecast has not been entirely perfect\" in the past (the jobless rate has certainly fallen faster than expected last August). He conceded that pay growth has been weaker than expected, but the Bank is hopeful that real wages will break into positive territory this year. Ben Broadbent is asked about the BoE's huge stock of UK gilts (government debt) -- when might it start unwinding QE? We know from the US experience that markets can get quite jittery, Broadbent says (a reference to the taper tantrum last summer) He suggests it would be sensible to start reversing QE at a time when markets are calm, risk appetite has picked up, and when the UK's debt/GDP ratio has started falling, to avoid volatility. Ben Broadbent also welcomed the measures announced by the European Central Bank last week, during his appearance at the Treasury committee today (see here onwards) He said the new \u20ac400bn offer of cheap lending to banks was rather more important than the interest rate cuts (which includes negative rates on bank deposits at the ECB). It is \"very welcome\" that Mario Draghi and the ECB have gone so far, and decided to pushed down bank borrowing costs. That should incentivise lending to the real economy, Broadbent says. He warned, though, that Draghi isn't the only person responsible for steering the eurozone to a \"sustainable place\". The eurozone needs more risk sharing across the financial system, and that requires 'deeply political' questions. More Ben Broadbent - he told MPs that UK interest rates will probably be lower over the next three to five years than in the run-up to the crisis. Over in parliament, Ben Broadbent is being questioned by the Treasury committee over his appointment as a deputy governor to the Bank of England. It's being streamed live here. He's already told MPs that he believes the housing market is the biggest threat to the UK stability of the UK, agreeing with governor Mark Carney. Broadbent said he disagreed with Andy Haldane (now the Bank's chief economist), who warned a year ago this week that the bond market bubble was the most serious threat to stability. As Broadbent put it: Andy is the master of the colourful turn of phrase, but I would disagree with him.... Maybe he had Haldane's classic \"The Dog and the Frisbee\" speech, about the challenge of spotting a crisis in time, in mind.... Back on the housing market, Broadbent said he was 'nervous' about the idea of changing the tax system to rein in house prices. How rare is the current period of falling real wages? Well, RBS's economics team have been crunching through over a century of data and found just two examples when paypackets failed to match inflation over a sustained period: The last one was in the mid-1920s -- a grim time for the UK economy, prompting workers to hold the General Strike. Press Association have wrapped up more political reaction to the jobs data: Employment minister Esther McVey: \"As we build a stronger economy, businesses up and down the country are feeling increasingly confident about creating jobs, meaning many thousands more people are in work every day.\" Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg: \"This coalition Government is strengthening the foundations on which our economy is built, creating the conditions for greater confidence, more jobs and further growth.\" (at least the chancellor didn't inflict any more Star Wars puns on his followers) Reminder - I posted Labour's response in full at 10.47am, in which shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, Rachel Reeves, warned: \"Thousands of people who work hard are struggling to make ends meet because of the government's failure to tackle the cost-of-living crisis and make work pay. That\u2019s led to a staggering 60% increase in the number of working people claiming housing benefit because they can't afford their rent, costing taxpayers an estimated \u00a34.8 billion. Bad news -- it appears that UK productivity may actually have fallen, even while the economy was creating more jobs Today's report (online here) shows that the total number of hours worked in February-April rose by 1.5%, compared to the previous quarter. That's faster than the 1.1% increase in output across the global economy (as estimated by the NIESR think tank), meaning that each hour of work actually produced less end-product. Newsnight economics correspondent Duncan Weldon reckons it's a worrying sign: Not clear why this is, though. One theory is that it takes time for new staff to become fully productive [although firms would presumably only hire to address demand]. Perhaps the new jobs created over the last year are in less productive sectors? Here's the details: Here's a reminder of the key points in today's unemployment data: Just noticed that the Office for National Statistics has produced a short video outlining today's Labour Market survey: Looking for a round-up of expert reaction to today's unemployment data? Look no further: UK employment data: what the economists say Over in Greece, employees who lost their jobs at the state TV station a year ago have just held a protest in Athens. They are marking the first anniversary of the closure of ERT (later re-opened with a much smaller staff), and demanding to be reinstated. One technician, who was fired last year, told our correspondent Helena Smith that: \"The new government station is nothing like the old one.\" They are now marching to the spot where cleaning staff were attacked by riot police yesterday (see Tuesday's liveblog for photos), in a show of solidarity. Starbucks has now responded to EC's probe into its tax affairs (along with Apple and Fiat, as explained earlier). The coffee chain said: \"We comply with all relevant tax rules, laws, and OECD guidelines and we're studying the Commission's announcement related to the state aid investigation in the Netherlands.\" (via my former colleague David Gow) He didn't mention falling real wages, though In Parliament, David Cameron has declared that the UK has reached an \"important milestone\", with two million more people in work in the private sector since the last election. Our Politics Liveblog has all the action: Cameron and Miliband at PMQs The Resolution Foundation has also produced a chart, showing how self-employment levels grew steadily through the crisis, while the number of employees has picked up more recently: Laura Gardiner, senior analyst at the Resolution Foundation, comments: \u201cThe volatility of earnings figures, rising and falling at different points this year, only underlines the imperfect nature of what we know about average pay. Distorted by the bonus picture in 2013, and missing the growing pool of 4.5 million self-employed workers, the best we can say about these latest figures is that 2014 has yet to live up to its promise of being the year of the pay rise. \u201cThe positive picture on employment \u2013 with a strong rise in the number of both employees and the self-employed \u2013 should eventually help to push up average wages. But there\u2019s no sign of it happening yet.\u201d Back to this morning's UK jobs data, and this Bloomberg chart shows how total wage growth has subsided steadily since the financial crisis: A big story has been breaking in Brussels this morning, where the European Commission has opened investigations into tax deals involving Apple in Ireland, Starbucks in the Netherlands, and Fiat Finance and Trade in Luxembourg. The probe will investigate whether the three companies' corporation tax arrangements violate European state aid laws. Joaqu\u00edn Almunia, Commission vice president in charge of competition policy, told reporters that it is vital that corporations make a fair contribution to government coffers: Almunia said: In the current context of tight public budgets, it is particularly important that large multinationals pay their fair share of taxes. Under the EU's state aid rules, national authorities cannot take measures allowing certain companies to pay less tax than they should if the tax rules of the Member State were applied in a fair and non-discriminatory way.\" Apple has already insisted it hasn't received any selective treatment by the Irish authorities. And in the last few minutes, Dublin's government also vowed to \"vigorously defend all aspects\" of the case. The FT's Peter Spiegel sums up Almunia's briefing: The full announcement from the EC is here. Here's our news story on today's unemployment data: UK employment surges but wages lag behind inflation Martin Beck, senior economic advisor to the EY ITEM Club, is also struck that wage packets aren't benefitting from the recovery in the labour market: \u201cThe stark contrast between a robust jobs market, but meagre wages growth continues. Despite the three months to March seeing the largest gain in employment since records began in 1971, there is no sign of a slowdown in jobs growth in today\u2019s data.\" The Unite union has welcomed the fall in unemployment, but is worried by the rise in self-employment (up by 337,000 to 4.54 million in the last year) Unite general secretary Len McCluskey isn't holding back, saying: Precarious self-employment is soaring, while the continuing wage siege feeds a fall in living standards not seen since the Victorian era leaving the finances of ordinary families on a knife edge. The FT's Sarah O'Connor wonders whether the weak wage growth shows that the UK labour market has been changed by the financial crisis. Thinking back, UK unemployment didn't soar as much as economists expected during the last recession -- as the charts earlier in the blog show, jobless rates were much worse in the 1980s. Could this be the payback? And here's David Cameron, tweeting the good news that thousands more people are joining the labour force each day. Rachel Reeves MP, Labour's Shadow Work and Pensions Secretary, says: \"While this fall in overall unemployment is welcome, working people are over \u00a31,600 a year worse off than when David Cameron came to office and pay has fallen behind inflation. \"Thousands of people who work hard are struggling to make ends meet because of the government's failure to tackle the cost-of-living crisis and make work pay. That\u2019s led to a staggering 60% increase in the number of working people claiming housing benefit because they can't afford their rent, costing taxpayers an estimated \u00a34.8 billion. \"The government should restore the value of the national minimum wage, get more employers to pay a living wage, extend free childcare provision, freeze gas and electricity bills and get the next generation into work with apprenticeships and a compulsory jobs guarantee.\u201d Today's weak earnings figures show that Britain's cost of living crisis isn't over, claims TUC General Secretary Frances O\u2019Grady. She's worried that families will face more pain if the Bank of England were to start tightening monetary policy by raising borrowing costs: O\u2019Grady says: \u201cPay packets have nosedived since the government prematurely declared an end to Britain\u2019s cost of living crisis last month. \u201cIt\u2019s great that more people are joining the workforce but hugely worrying that workers are still not getting the decent pay rises they need to get by. \u201cThe news that the economy is returning to its pre-crash size will be of cold comfort to the millions of workers who are still thousands of pounds a year worse off compared to five years ago. \u201cWith pay rises falling below one per cent, an early interest rise could cause major problems for millions of mortgage-holders.\u201d 'Nosedived'? Well, pay did slump by 1.7% year-on-year in April alone; strip out bonuses and it crept up by 0.4%. Rob Wood of Berenberg Bank reckons pay growth will rise over the next few months as the distortion caused by the cut in income tax from 50% to 45% in April 2013 fades away. As Wood puts it: Pay was shifted from early 2013 to April to take advantage of the cut in the higher rate of income tax. As a result, finance pay fell 6.1% yoy in April, construction was down 4.6% yoy while manufacturing and wholesaling slowed sharply. This chart confirms that average UK pay packets failed to keep pace with inflation (yellow), whether you include bonuses (dark blue) or not (light blue). Here's the headline unemployment rate, which fell to a new five-year low of 6.6% in February-April: This chart shows how the employment rate climbed again to 72.9%, but remains below the all-time peak: And this shows that full-time jobs made up the bulk of new hires over the last year: RBS's economics team have also put together a chart showing changes to the labour market in the last 12 months: Jeremy Cook, chief economist at the currency company, World First, is concerned to see that wage growth has slumped, even as employment increased strongly: That means interest rates won't rise for another year, Cook suggests: \u201cWage growth has fallen to 0.7%, vs 1.2% expected, and this is still a major cause for concern. As a result I am still expecting the Bank of England to hold policy right through into the second quarter of 2015, mainly courtesy of the lack of real wage increases. ITV's Joel Hills points out that the UK state sector workforce has shrunk since April 2013, while the private sector has swelled: Ian Stewart, chief economist at Deloitte, reckons the weak wage growth in the last quarter is good news for the Bank of England (!). He says: \u201cA powerful labour market recovery is delivering remarkable job growth and rapid falls in unemployment. Self-employment is booming and full time employment is also growing at the fastest rate in nine years. The good news for the Bank of England is that this broad-based jobs recovery shows few signs of generating inflationary wage pressures.\u201d It's rather less welcome if you're a worker struggling to make ends meet after the long squeeze on household incomes since the financial crisis struck. Deloitte aren't actually trolling us, though -- their point is that the BoE is more likely to start raising interest rates once it sees upward pressure on prices. Today's report confirms another trend -- the recent steady fall in unemployment has partly been driven by a big rise in self-employed workers. The ONS explains that since February-April 2013: The number of employees increased by 457,000 to reach 25.75 million. The number of self-employed people increased by 337,000 to reach 4.54 million. The number of unpaid family workers increased by 22,000 to reach 127,000. The number of people on government supported training and employment programmes decreased by 37,000 to reach 120,000. You can read today's labour market report yourself, here. Here's Press Association's early take on the news that Britain's jobless rate has fallen to its lowest rate since 2009, while wage growth slowed sharply. RECORD 345,000 RISE IN EMPLOYMENT Employment rose by a record 345,000 in the three months to April but Britain's workers were squeezed by a dramatic slowdown in pay growth, official figures showed today. The number of people in work stood at 30.54 million, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS), after a rise which was the highest since records began in 1971. It means 780,000 jobs have been added since a year earlier, the biggest annual rise since 1989. But pay growth for the period slowed to 0.7%, a sharp fall on last month's figure of 1.7%, blunting hopes of a return to a period of real-terms pay growth. The increase was well below the latest inflation rate of 1.8%, meaning the cost of living is still going up more quickly than pay packets. This slowdown in total pay was largely accounted for by bonuses, which fell sharply compared with a period last year when in many cases they were deferred to April as tax changes were introduced. But regular pay growth also slowed, to 0.9% from 1.3%. Unemployment fell by 161,000 to 2.16 million, with the jobless rate dropping to 6.6%. Today's jobs data shows that average earnings actually *fell* by 1.7% in April alone. That's why total pay growth in February-April fell to just 0.7%, from 1.9% in January-March. Why? Well, it's partly due to the impact of the abolition of the UK 50% tax rate, which came into effect a year ago. That meant many big-earners deferred their bonuses until April 2013, to benefit from the lower tax rate. That wasn't repeated this year. However, if you strip out bonuses, pay only rose by 0.9% in the three months to April, and by 0.4% in April alone -- well behind the inflation rate of 1.8%. BREAKING: Britain's jobless rate has hit a new five-year low, but real wages are shrinking. The UK jobless rate has fallen to just 6.6% in the three months to April, which is the lowest since early 2009. That's down from 6.8%, a bigger fall than expected. According to the Office for National Statistics, the number of people out of work fell by 161,00 in the quarter to April, lowering the unemployment total to 2.165m And the claimant count has fallen by 27,400 , as the fall in the number of people receiving jobless benefit continues to decline. BUT, and it's a big BUT --- weekly earnings rose by just 0.7% in the three months to April, which is substantially below inflation, which hit 1.8% in April. Reaction and details to follow.... Just 25 minutes until we get the latest UK unemployment data. The figures may show that British wage growth slowed again and lagged behind the inflation rate -- putting a squeeze back on consumers. My colleague Katie Allen reports: Britain's \"cost of living crisis\" will return to the fore today when official data shows real wages falling again. Pay growth briefly edged higher than inflation in the spring, marking a break in years of falling real wages and providing a boost to the Conservatives as they seek to take the squeeze on household budgets off the pre-election agenda. Labour has argued that what it calls a cost of living crisis is far from over. Economists are predicting official figures will show that pay growth slowed markedly in the three months to April, undershooting inflation. Here's Katie preview: British wages slowing again as consumers remain under pressure So what else do we expect? Economists predict that Britain's jobless rate will have fallen to a new five-year low in the three months to April, at just 6.7%. The more timely claimant count data is predicted to show a 25,000 drop in May, which would maintain its recent trend. Michael Hewson of CMC Markets comments: In fact over the last eleven months the decline in jobless claims has more or less averaged around 30k a month, a pretty good sign of an economy that appears to be humming along nicely. But how many of the new jobs are part-time, or self-employed? We find out soon.... Germany's Lufthansa just startled the Frankfurt stock market with an unexpected profit warning, sending its shares tumbling 9%. Other airline shares have also been hit, after Lufthansa slashed its operating profit forecast by a third, to \u20ac1bn, from up to \u20ac1.5bn before. In a brief statement, it blamed weaker demand from passengers and cargo, and the impact of recent strikes. It also cited Venezuela's decision to devaluate its currency when used by airlines and foreign direct investment (more here). Lufthansa said: Reason for lowering the forecast is a weaker than expected revenue development in the passenger and freight businesses as well as negative result impacts from strikes and the devaluation of the Venezuelan Bolivar. Europe's stock markets are open, and the main indices have fallen by around 0.2%-0.3%. The FTSE 100 is down 13 points, pulled down by heavyweight Vodafone going ex-dividend (ie, it's too late to qualify for the next payment to shareholders). Sainsbury's are leading the risers, up 2.4% after CEO Justin King broke away from that selfie session to tell reporters that he's sticking to this year's sales targets, and doesn't expect profit forecasts to change. Hungary has slipped into deflation, after its Consumer Price Index showed that prices fell by 0.1% over the last 12 months. Hold onto your hats, folks. An inquiry into the Payday loan market has discovered that it's uncompetitive. The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) has concluded that a payday customer could typically save around \u00a330 to \u00a360 per year if the market worked properly. It suggests an independent price comparison website is created to help people choose between the likes of, say, Wonga and QuickQuid. It also wants pay lenders could be forced to spell out the overall cost of defaulting on a loan more clearly up front. Demand for short-term loans has soared in the UK in recent years, once the financial crisis kicked off. Lenders have been savaged for profiting from the UK's cost of living crisis, which saw real wages shrink between 2010 and 2014. But as Tim Harford argued in the FT last year: Wonga did not create modern Britain; modern Britain created Wonga. All the more reason to make the sector competitive, then.... The World Bank also warned that the global economy is not \"totally out of the woods yet\". Governments need to prepare for further trouble ahead: Kaushik Basu, the bank's senior vice president and chief economist, said: A gradual tightening of fiscal policy and structural reforms are desirable to restore fiscal space depleted by the 2008 financial crisis. In brief, now is the time to prepare for the next crisis.\" Overnight, the World Bank warned that growth in the euro area is \"tepid\", having emerged from recession a year ago. It also warned that \"persistently low Euro Area-wide inflation\" is a concern (see chart below). That's from the new Global Economic Prospects report, in which the World Bank also cut its global growth forecast from 3.2% to 2.8% this year. The recovery in the Euro Area remains hesitant The Euro Area is still in the early phases of recovery. GDP and private consumption spending in some periphery economies remain nearly 10 percent below pre-crisis peaks and investment is 40-50 percent lower in Spain, Portugal and Ireland. To date the recovery in the periphery has been driven by exports, reflecting competitiveness gains earned painfully through weak or even negative wage growth that have brought down unit labor costs. Competitiveness gains continue to remain strong, supporting underlying activity. Encouragingly, there are signs that the labor market may be bottoming out, with unemployment rates throughout the Euro Area beginning to inch down, albeit from extremely high levels. Financial conditions have also eased considerably, reflected in the fall in periphery sovereign debt spreads to pre-crisis lows. In addition to substantial progress in restoring fiscal balance within the Euro Area, the establishment of a pan- European banking supervision regime and bailout rules represent important achievements. However there is some way to go before full backstop measures are in place to cope with large-scale banking sector distress. The full report's online here - here's a few more charts. WH Smith also reported underwhelming results this morning, driven down by a 4% decline in sales on the high street. Total takings across the newsagent group were flat in the last 14 weeks, while like-for-like sales (a better measure of performance) fell 2%. Even its Travel business, which outperformed the high street arm, failed to achieve any LFL growth. Sainsbury isn't immune to the shockwaves reverberating through Britain's grocery business -- its sales have fallen for the second quarter in a row. Like-for-like retail sales fell by 1.1% in the first three months, excluding fuel. It's not the best way for Justin King to step aside as CEO after a decade running Sainsbury's (and doing a pretty decent job too). King points out that it's a tough market for everyone: Lower food price inflation and reduced fuel prices are a welcome respite to customers\u2019 finances but they continue to spend cautiously, leading to industry growth in the quarter being the slowest in a decade. He's now posing for selfies at the London Stock Market - so clearly not too dispirited by events... Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the financial markets, the economy, the eurozone and business. Quite a lot going on in the UK this morning -- starting with the latest unemployment figures, at 9.30am BST. They're expected to show another rise in employment, a drop in people receiving unemployment benefit, and possibly a further fall in the unemployment rate from last month's five-year low of 6.8%. But the figures will also show whether earnings are keeping pace with rising prices -- is the recovery actually pushing up real wages? In the City two retailers, J Sainsbury and WH Smith, are reporting results this morning. It's the last time that Justin King will face Sainsbury investors before stepping down as CEO this summer. In the eurozone, we'll be watching the new Greek government which was sworn in yesterday. And economists are digesting the news overnight that the World Bank has cut its growth forecasts -- it now expects the global economy to expand by 2.8% compared with the 3.2% previously predicted. It also cut its forecast for developing area growth, from 5.3% to 4.8%. World Bank cuts global economic growth forecast As Larry Elliott reports: Bad weather in the US, tension in the Ukraine, the slowdown in China and political strife in countries such as Turkey will all delay an expected pick-up in activity, the bank said in its half-yearly Global Economic Prospects. Its president, Jim Kim, expressed disappointment at the prospect of a third straight year of sub-5% growth in the developing world, which he said was insufficient to meet his aim of eradicating extreme poverty by 2030. \"Growth rates in the developing world remain far too modest to create the kind of jobs we need to improve the lives of the poorest 40%,\" Kim said. I'll be tracking all the key developments through the day...",

      "bodyText": "Unemployment fell to a five-year low in April but Britain's workers were squeezed by a dramatic slowdown in pay growth, according to official figures. A record rise in the number of people in work saw the jobless rate drop to 6.6% in the three months to April, reaching a level last seen in January 2009. George Osborne hailed the progress as an important step towards the goal of full employment, while the chief secretary to the Treasury, Danny Alexander, said: \"Britain is bouncing back.\" But the Labour party and trade unions pointed to a fall in workers' standard of living, as the figures also showed that pay growth fell to 0.7%, sharply down from 1.7% the month before and well below inflation, running at 1.8%. The Trades Union Congress general secretary, Frances O'Grady, said the government had prematurely declared an end to Britain's cost of living crisis. \"It's great that more people are joining the workforce but hugely worrying that workers are still not getting the decent pay rises they need to get by. \"The news that the economy is returning to its pre-crash size will be of cold comfort to the millions of workers who are still thousands of pounds a year worse off compared to five years ago. \"With pay rises falling below one per cent, an early interest rise could cause major problems for millions of mortgage holders.\" Economists suggested the squeeze, which means pay packets are still falling in real terms, would prove a strong influence on the Bank of England and relieve pressure on the central bank to hike interest rates before next spring. Ross Walker, UK economist at Royal Bank of Scotland, said anaemic wage inflation trends would persuade the Bank of England to refrain from raising base rates before the end of the year. John Philpott, director of The Jobs Economist consultancy, said the figures showed the long term unemployed were finding jobs and young people were getting back to work, but pay awards remained very low. \"Britain's jobs market is booming everywhere apart from in most people's pay packets,\" he said. The fall in wage growth was blamed partly on government changes to the top rate of tax, which encouraged workers in line for large bonuses to take them in April last year. Bonus rises this year are therefore smaller by comparison, dragging down the median average total wage figure in the latest data. There also remains uncertainty around how much of the growth seen in employment is in low-paid, insecure self-employment or part-time work. Employment rose by a record 345,000 over the three month period, pushing the number of people in work to 30.54 million, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS), after a rise which was the highest since records began in 1971. It means 780,000 jobs have been added in the past 12 months, the biggest annual rise since 1989. Almost half the jobs in that time can be attributed to self employment, though in the last three months full-time employment spurred growth . The sectors creating the most jobs were agriculture, \"real estate activities\", the professional, scientific and technical sector and among \"people employed by households\". Unemployment fell by 161,000 to 2.16 million, with the jobless rate dropping to 6.6%. Rob Wood, chief UK economist at Berenberg bank, said pay would recover during the summer and reveal that job shortages in many sectors were forcing employers to raise wages. He predicted that the Bank of England's monetary policy committee would begin to raise rates in November. The employment minister, Esther McVey said the figures showed businesses were feeling increasingly confident about creating jobs. She said: \"Helping young people to get a job is vital to securing our economic future, so it's welcome that youth unemployment has continued to fall \u2013 we'll continue to do all we can to inspire the next generation of employers and business leaders and help them to build their careers.\" The shadow work and pensions secretary, Rachel Reeves, said: \"While this fall in overall unemployment is welcome, working people are over \u00a31,600 a year worse off than when David Cameron came to office and pay has fallen behind inflation.\"",
