    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "BAE Systems has missed out on a \u00a36bn contract to supply fighter jets to the United Arab Emirates, in a blow to British export hopes and David Cameron's own attempts to secure a deal. The UK arms manufacturer revealed on Thursday that more than a year of talks to supply 60 Typhoon aircraft to the UAE had failed. It also said vital negotiations with the Saudi government over the pricing of an existing Typhoon contract, keenly anticipated by shareholders, will drag into next year. The news is a serious setback for BAE as it seeks to reduce its reliance on US and British defence markets that have been hit by government spending cuts. BAE's search for new sources of revenue has seen it pursue a failed merger with the Airbus owner Eads and launch a major push into emerging defence markets such as the UAE and India. In its statement, BAE said: \"BAE Systems and the UK Government have been in discussions with the Government of the United Arab Emirates regarding a range of defence and security capabilities including the potential supply of Typhoon aircraft. The UAE have advised that they have elected not to proceed with these proposals at this time.\" The news is a blow not only to BAE but also to the prime minister, who intervened personally last month to try to secure a deal that would have represented a significant boost for British exports. During a visit to the UAE, Cameron urged Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, the crown prince of Abu Dhabi, to opt for the Typhoon over a rival fighter produced by France's Dassault Systemes. Analysts thought the prime minister's move could have swung the deal for BAE, raising hopes that the UK will meet George Osborne's target of doubling exports to \u00a31tn by 2020. Analysts at JP Morgan had estimated that a deal to supply fighters and other equipment to the UAE could have been worth 45p a share to BAE, which closed at 442p. The company said yesterday it had not built the prospect of a successful outcome into its financial plans. \"BAE Systems stands ready to work with the UAE to address any future requirements,\" the company said. BAE also said that it was still in talks with the Saudi government about the terms of its contract to supply 72 Typhoons to the country. A deal was signed in 2007 but it included provisions for renegotiation as economic conditions changed. The Saudi negotiations are being followed closely by investors. The company is buying back \u00a31bn of its shares to boost investor returns but has said completing the buyback depends on the Saudi talks being resolved. The company said: \"Whilst good progress has been made, a definitive agreement has yet to be reached. A timely agreement in the new year would be reflected in trading for 2013. The group's focus in these negotiations continues to be on agreeing appropriate terms and not the timing of such an agreement.\" The company said in October that its 2013 earnings would be reduced by 6p or 7p a share if there was no agreement. It stressed that it had won major new business from Saudi Arabia this year, including \u00a31.5bn for guided weapons and Tornado maintenance. BAE said it had a long-standing relationship with its \"much valued customer in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia\", suggesting it expected to strike a deal.\u00ac",

Not really, because all the major economies are at different stages of the economic cycle and have their own particular challenges to address. The one common factor is that central banks are winging it. Zero interest rates and QE were the response to a sluggish recovery, a broken financial system, heavily indebted consumers and the threat of deflation. But having created a world of stimulus junkies, central bankers are faced with the tricky decision of how to reduce the dosage.

With inflation remaining benign, the majority of Fed members expect the first rate hike in 2015.</p> <p>Secondly the tapering amount has been deemed by many analysts as a \u2018token taper\u2019 and essentially just allows the Fed to test the waters and assess conditions further.</p> <p>Thirdly, the taper has been on the back of rapidly improving conditions while the Fed reinforced that asset purchases are not on a pre-set course and will be adjusted accordingly. On this notion we can only assume that if conditions worsen, the situation will be adjusted accordingly.

All the main European indices closed up between 1.4% and 2%, as this graph shows. Wall Street is hovering around yesterday's record highs. Michael Hewson of CMC Markets said there was relief that the Fed had finally signalled its intention to \"slowly water down the punch bowl\": The removal of this festering sore of uncertainty, along with a more nuanced and tweaked tone of forward guidance has helped keep equity markets well underpinned, while US bond markets have reacted pretty much as we expected they would, though yields have started to edge a little higher, but so far remain below the recent yield highs of this year. As outlined in the earlier afternoon summary, traders see the Fed's actions as dovish - given its new forward guidance that interest rates could stay low for longer. Writing on Forbes tonight, banking expert Frances Coppola points out that the guidance remains vague: All the Fed gave was a view of the future based on what significant economic indicators at present show. But those indicators can of course change. The UK economy, for example, is doing far better than its indicators suggested even 6 months ago. And that\u2019s just it.Forward guidance is not specific. Indeed it cannot be specific, because predicting economic effects is rather like predicting the weather \u2013 you can predict the next day or two with reasonable certainty, but the longer-range your predictions are, the less reliable they become. Trying to predict where unemployment or inflation will be in 2016 resembles alchemy. My colleague Nick Fletcher has rounded up the action in London here: FTSE boosted by Federal Reserve news as Carnival steams ahead after update And with that, I'm off. Cheers, and goodnight. GW A warning shot for Deutsche Bank from Moody's -- cutting its outlook from stable to negative, and warning that earnings in 2014 and beyond remain uncertain. Back in Brussels, European Parliament president Martin Schulz has gone public with his opposition to Europe's banking union (see 4.33pm for details of his concerns), on Twitter. Over on fastFT, Carola Hoyos points out that BAE's loss could be French rival Dassault's gain, if it can persuade UAE to buy its Rafale jet fighter. And for French readers... More reaction to BAE's warning that the UAE has declined to buy $10bn of fighter jets: Defence firm BAE Systems has warned the City that a potential \u00a36bn deal to sell Eurofighter Typhoons to the UAE has collapsed. In a statement released with military timing just as the market closed, BAE told shareholders that the UAE had \"elected not to proceed with these proposals at this time.\" BAE said: All parties have invested significant effort in drawing up Typhoon proposals for the UAE and, recognising the risk, scale and complexity of such a transaction, the Group had not built this prospect into its planning assumptions. BAE Systems stands ready to work with the UAE to address any future requirements. Analysts had warned last month that BAE could lose out on the UAE deal, despite appearing to be the front-runner. BAE added in today's statement that it is still \"actively engaged in negotiations\" with the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia over the pricing of another fighter jet contract, the \"the Government to Government Salam Typhoon agreement\". BAE indicated that it wants to get the best priced deal, rather than rush something through. Whilst good progress has been made, a definitive agreement has yet to be reached. A timely agreement in the new-year would be reflected in trading for 2013. The Group's focus in these negotiations continues to be on agreeing appropriate terms and not the timing of such an agreement. BAE shares had risen almost 2% today -- this setback came just too late for investors to react.... Europe's precious plans for banking union have been found wanting, by the European Parliament president Martin Schulz. Schulz is telling leaders at their summit in Brussels that the \"breakthrough\" in creating a single rescue fund and a single supervisor falls well short of what's needed. Schulz is particularly damning about the convoluted system drawn up to handle a failing bank (see here), warning that it won't be able to react in time. He is telling leaders in a speech that: This is comparable to dealing with an emergency admission to hospital by first convening the hospital\u2019s board of directors instead of giving the patient immediate treatment.... If we were to implement the ECOFIN decisions on a banking union in this way, it would not only be a lost opportunity. It would be the biggest mistake yet in the resolution of the crisis. (quotes via Reuters) Schulz's opposition is significant -- as Ian Traynor explained in this analysis, once leaders have rubber-stamped the plan it must make its way through the European Parliament. Germany's refusal to allow the ESM bailout pot to be tapped to recapitalise a struggling bank has also alarmed some analysts, who are disappointed that Europe must wait a decade for the \u20ac55bn rescue fund to be created. After that calm start, US bond prices are slipping as traders digest the implications of the Fed buying fewer bonds with newly minted money in the months ahead. This has pushed the yield (or interest rate) on US 10-year bonds up to 2.933%, from 2.887% last night. UK borrowing costs are also inching higher, up to 2.959% from 2.912%. Time for some afternoon fun, or head-scratching: our Bumper Christmas quiz. It's packed with witty, taxing brain-teasers from the news in the last 12 months. Time for a catch-up. European markets have risen sharply today as the Federal Reserve's historic move to start winding back on its huge stimulus programme was greeted calmly by investors around the globe. With Japan's Nikkei hitting a six-year high overnight, the initial reaction to the winding back of America's quantitative easing programme is positive -- particularly as the Fed was more upbeat about the US recovery. Expectations that EU member states will sign off on a new banking union deal at a two-day summit in Brussels starting today has also reassured European traders. By cutting its bond programme by just $10bn (starting in January), and reiterating that interest rates won't rise, the Fed maintained a dovish stance despite finally deciding to slow the pace of money printing. If the US economy avoids a shock, the Fed might not cut its bond-buying programme to zero until next October, or even 12 months time. Should new problems arise, it could slow or stop tapering. The benchmark indices are all up over 1% in afternoon trading, while the bond and currency markets remain calm. Mike van Dulken of Accendo Markets coined it: The bearded one has delivered his pre-Christmas rally! However, it wasn't the bringer of children's toys but the US Fed chairman with his economic optimism-driven taper of QE3. The FTSE 100 is up around 60 points at 6557. Premier Asset Management fund manager Chris White reckons it will now end the year strongly: I think the momentum is likely to continue into the year-end. The FTSE should end 50-100 points higher from here. The Fed's decision to reinforce its pledge not to raise interest rates before the recovery is entrenched also cheered the City -- and reminded us that the Bank of England might need to tweak its own forward guidance. Ashraf Laidi, chief global strategist at City Index in London, explains: The Federal Reserve has successfully integrated the price stability component of its dual forward guidance into traders\u2019 psyche by further delinking tapering of asset purchases from tightening conditions in the bond market. The US dollar has strengthened through the day, helping to drive down the gold price. The pound has dropped to $1.635, a fall of 0.2%. ..... Elsewhere, our Europe editor Ian Traynor has warned that EU leaders face a tricky Summit in Brussels, given Germany's ongoing demands for tighter controls on weaker members of the eurozone. There are also austerity protests in Brussels, with farmers blocking roads and erecting fires. The Chinese central bank has launched an emergency liquidity programme to avert fears of a cash crunch. Greece's jobless rate has dropped slightly.... ...and Ireland's economy has posted rollicking growth in the last quarter. Hats off to Alex Barker of the Financial Times for this graph explaining why Europe's new rules for closing a failing bank might be a little, er, convoluted. Over on Wall Street, the opening bell has just been rung and trading is under way.... ...and there's a 'Now what?\" feeling on the trading floors. The main indices have all dropped slightly, with the Dow Jones index shedding 0.1%. Not a surprise, really, as the Dow and S&amp;P 500 both surged to record highs last night as Wall Street gave a thumbs-up to the Fed. The surprise rise in weekly jobless benefit claims is also weighing on shares... Hmmm, this wasn't in the plan. The weekly US jobs data this lunchtime showed that the number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefit has hit a near-nine month high. The number of initial claims rose by 10,000 last week to 379,000. Now, this weekly data is volatile (affected by seasonal factors and the weather) but it's not exactly a peachy sign - especially as claims also rose last week. Economists had expected the weekly total to fall by around 35,000 to 334,000. Economics editor Larry Elliott reckons that Ben Bernanke had one eye on the history books when he announced that the Fed would taper its bond buying next month, at his final press conference as chair. The outgoing chairman of the Fed, an expert on the economic policy blunders of the 1930s, has pursued an ultra-stimulative approach in his determination to avoid a second Great Depression. But he does not want to be blamed, as Alan Greenspan was, for creating bubbles by leaving too much stimulus in place for too long. He can now say that he initiated the winding down of QE before handing the reins over to Janet Yellen. Does the Fed's decision have ramifications for other central banks? Not really, because all the major economies are at different stages of the economic cycle and have their own particular challenges to address. The one common factor is that central banks are winging it. Zero interest rates and QE were the response to a sluggish recovery, a broken financial system, heavily indebted consumers and the threat of deflation. But having created a world of stimulus junkies, central bankers are faced with the tricky decision of how to reduce the dosage. The answer from the Fed is plain: slowly and with great caution. More here: Federal Reserve starts taper \u2013 and avoids Wall Street bloodbath Over in Brussels, EU leaders arriving for their final summit of 2013 will be greeted by a large banner reminding them that Latvia joins the eurozone fold in two week.... Meanwhile, those anti-austerity demonstrators have been getting the attention. Two protesters wearing Angela Merkel and Jose Manuel Barroso masks have been displaying a banner wishing the leaders a \"Merry crisis and a happy new war\". As explained earlier, the summit is meant to finalise new banking rules to prevent a new crisis.... The Bank of England (BoE) may be watching today's market reaction with particular interest. The Federal Reserve has managed to 'sugarcoat' the tapering by hardening its forward guidance on interest rates - saying they could remain untouched \"well past the time\" that the US jobless rate hits its 6.5% threshold, especially if inflation remains low. In the UK, the jobless rate (7.4%) is likely to hit the BoE's 7% threshold much earlier than its original estimate of 2016. Governor Mark Carney regularly states that the 7% is not a trigger -- might the BoE eventually toughen up his own language? Jane Foley, top currency strategist at Rabobank, reckons it might. She says: Just as the Fed has altered its forward guidance this week, there is speculation that the BoE may have to follow suit.... We currently anticipate the first BoE rate hike in May 2015. Give the buoyancy of most UK data releases, the market will start to bring forward its expectations for a hike unless the Bank acts to contain speculation. All quiet in the emerging markets..... Intriguing moves in China today, where the central bank conducted an emergency short-term injections of funding into the country's financial system. The People's Bank of China also gave banks more time to apply for funds, in a bid to calm fears that cash could run short in the run-up to Christmas. Those concerns had been fuelled by PBOC itself, which has been withholding new liquidity in recent days in a bid to tighten credit. That drove up the rates at which banks were prepared to lend to each other. My colleague Heather Stewart has been looking into it, and reports: Echoing similar measures it took in June, the People's Bank of China took the unusual step of announcing, via Weibo, the Chinese equivalent of Twitter, that it had carried out a short-term liquidity operation, or SLO. Trading was also extended by an extra half an hour, to allow banks to benefit from the measure. No details were published about the scale of the SLO, or which banks had been involved; but the liquidity injection evoked memories of the crisis measures taken by central banks in Europe and the US in the wake of the collapse of Lehman Brothers, as markets threatened to dry up. Mark Williams, of consultancy Capital Economics, said: \"The story of the past few months has been that the PBoC wants to tighten monetary conditions to slow credit growth, and that's been happening in fits and starts.\" More here: China's central bank acts to avert short-term credit crunch There's a good take on the FT too: Central bank acts to ease China cash crunch fears This cartoon is doing the rounds again -- highlighting the difference between merely buying fewer bonds with newly made money, and actually selling them or raising interest rates. The Wall Street Journal has a good round-up of City reaction to the Fed's tapering. It confirms that the modest pace of the move (just $10bn in January), and the new commitments to keep interest rates low, have calmed investors' fears \u2018Clear Message Received\u2019: European Investors React to Fed Tapering Here's a flavour: Sandra Holdsworth, portfolio manager at Kames Capital, which manages \u00a353 billion of assets: \u201cIt\u2019s only a small reduction in the pace of purchases, which is why risky assets haven\u2019t reacted negatively. The FOMC statement also reflects the market\u2019s view on the outlook for the U.S. economy more closely, which is a big relief. We remain positive on peripheral markets while we expect Treasury yields to rise over the next 6-9 months but only modestly, as a rise in medium and long-term yields will encourage some investors to move further out the yield curve.\u201d Neil Wilkinson, a senior fund manager at Royal London Asset Management, which oversees more than $73.5 billion of assets: \u201cIt\u2019s a clever move from the Fed. On balance it is a surprise that tapering occurred now, but emphasising the data-dependency of future tapering, and reiterating that it is not just the headline unemployment figure that they are focusing on but a number of measures, allows them to anchor expectations that rates will remain lower for longer, and that tapering will not be aggressively applied.\u201d In Greece, meanwhile, the unemployment rate fell slightly in the third quarter of this year, but remains depressingly high. The jobless rate inched down to 27%, from 27.1% in April-June. It was still higher than a year ago (24.8%), and more than twice the eurozone average (12.1%). The unemployment rate for women remains considerably higher than for males (31,3% versus 23.8%), Elstat reported. And the youth unemployment rate was 57.2% Just in: Ireland's economy posted surprisingly strong growth in the third quarter of the year. It's good news for Dublin in its first few days since exiting its eurozone bailout. The central statistics office reports that Irish gross domestic product increased by 1.5% in the July-September quarter. GNP (which strips out the impact of multinationals) jumped by 1.6%. Consumer spending picked up by 0.9%, but exports shrank by 0.8% -- perhaps due to weak demand from euro neighbours. Growth in the second quarter was also revised upwards (Q2 GDP up to +1.0%, from +0.4%; Q2 GNP up to -0.1% from -0.4%). The CSO reported strong growth in many industries, saying: Distribution,transport,software and communication increased by 2.1 per cent in volume terms between the second and third quarters of 2013. Industry (including Building and construction) increased by 2.2 per cent and Other services increased by 1.2 per cent in volume terms on a seasonally adjusted basis over the same period. On the other hand Public administration and defence decreased by 1.0 per cent and Agriculture, forestry and fishing declined by 2.9 per cent between the second and third quarters of 2013. Here's the full details. Hundreds of protesters have blocked traffic around the site of the European Union summit in Brussels, in an anti-austerity protests. Farmers are leading the protests. Tractors and bales of hays obstructed entry to the main road leading up to the EU headquarters in Brussels during morning rush hour on Thursday, only hours before the leaders open their summit. Wooden pallets were set ablaze at one road to block traffic. Bruno Dujardin of the CNE union said the demonstrators are seeking: A Europe for the people, which respects the workers and allows all European workers to have decent working conditions. (Via AP). Back to the EU leaders summit in Brussels which kicks off shortly. Europe editor Ian Traynor explains that leaders will attempt to finalise crucial measures on banking reform to strengthen the single currency. At the heart of the issue is Germany's insistence that weaker nations should commit to make structural reforms, and that the cost of bank rescues should not be shared too widely. Here's a flavour: European leaders gather in Brussels on Thursday for a two-day summit aimed at shoring up the euro, pooling economic reform efforts and entrenching a radical new regime for controlling most of the eurozone banking sector. The summit begins after late-night negotiations in Brussels saw finance ministers thrash out a complicated compromise deal that left national governments ultimately responsible for bailing out their banks. Taken together, the policies amount to the biggest moves attempted by the 17 governments of the single currency since the euro and sovereign debt crisis exploded four years ago. The action being plotted is highly contentious, the policies are divisive. The main issue is what chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany wants, what she does not want, and what she might get in the end. \"They are trying to solve a German problem,\" said a senior EU official. Here's the full analysis: European leaders gather for summit after complicated banking compromise And Rob Wood of Berenberg is concerned that UK retail sales volumes have risen by just 0.7% since July: Retail sales are the one data reading not signalling runaway growth in the UK. Indeed, they point to a notable cooling since the summer, in contrast to all the business surveys. That 0.3% rise in UK retail sales in November suggests shoppers were handing back for bargains as Christmas gets closer, says economics editor Larry Elliott And with real wages still falling, households have a good reason to approach the festive season cautiously. Howard Archer, UK economist at IHS Global Insight, reckons: With purchasing power being limited by consumer price inflation running well above earnings growth for a prolonged period, it is likely that many people have felt the need to control their spending after spending at a rapid rate in the third quarter. While shares rise, bonds are calm. The Fed appears (at pixel time) to have begun the process of slowing its purchases of US government debt without driving down prices (and thus pushing up borrowing costs). British gilts (debt issued by the UK) have dropped a little in value, pushing up the effective interest rate on 10-year UK bonds to 2.94% from 2.92% yesterday. But such a small move shouldn't cause any alarm. Back in the markets, the index of major European companies has climbed to a two-week high. The rally is still being driven by last night's Fed decision and its commitment to hold borrowing costs down until well into 2015 (see opening post onwards for details). The FTSEurofirst 100 is up 1.4% this morning to its highest level since early December, led by blue chip companies like Axa, IG and Deutsche Telecom (all up over 2.75%). Daniel McCormack, strategist with Macquarie, explains that investors are reassured by the Fed: The overall announcement is not as hawkish as it first appeared. As the Fed announced the taper, it also pushed out expectations for when it is going to lift the policy rate. Philippe Gijsels, head of research at BNP Paribas Fortis Global Markets, agreed: By tapering now, Bernanke has taken away quite a bit of the short-term market risk. He took away with one hand some of the stimulus, but gave it back by the other by stressing that short-term rates won't go up for a longer period. A small gobbet of UK economic news -- retail sales rose by 0.3% in November, boosted by increased sales of warm clothes as the weather turned more wintery. That's in line with forecasts. The big question is whether December is proceeding as well as hoped. Some analysts are worried, sending Marks &amp; Spencer and Debenham's shares sliding yesterday. While attention was on the Fed last night, European finance ministers were hamming out a crucial deal on banking union, ahead of a European summit today and tomorrow. Important breakthroughs were made in the early hours of this morning. EU ministers agreed a broad agreement for an an agency and a \u20ac55bn fund to shut troubled banks as soon as the European Central Bank starts to police them next year. As Reuters explains: European leaders, who will gather in Brussels later in the day, will sign off on it and the final touches will be made in negotiations with the European Parliament next year. \"The final pillar for the banking union has been achieved,\" Germany's Finance Minister Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble told journalists. But.... there are concerns that the new framework may not be nimble enough to deal with a failed bank (18 member countries need to be consulted). And Germany also refused to allow the Eurozone's bailout fund to be used to rescue a failing bank directly. Instead, if funds aren't available elsewhere (either via the \u20ac55bn fund or the taxpayer), a country would have to make the request itself. Our Europe editor Ian Traynor explains that ministers were under pressure to raise a deal before EU leaders start their own two-day summit today. He writes: There will be big problems with getting the deals agreed with the European parliament, and with national ratifications of a new treaty between participating governments on the funding of banking resolution. The French-led group of southern countries, the European commission and the ECB opposed this. \"It's a choice between a banking union that's not perfect, or nothing,\" said a senior EU official. Leaders are heading to Brussels now -- David Cameron and Enda Kenny have paid an important visit to Flanders first. The gold price just dropped to a new five-month low of $1,200/ounce, pushed down by the stronger dollar and renewed optimism over economic prospects Mike van Dulken of Accendo Markets, agrees that the Fed's upbeat view of the US economy, and its renewed commitment to record low interest rates, is calming fears in the markets. Finally, he adds, investors see tapering as an positive sign that conditions are improving, rather than fretting about less easy money next year. The Fed\u2019s move has been driven by improved US data (jobs, growth, spending, investment) and political progress (note the senate passed the bipartisan budget overnight), and balanced by a reinforcement of forward guidance that interest rates will stay very low for a \u2018considerable time after QE ends\u2019 and until unemployment falls below 6.5%\u2019. The dovish boost to forward guidance has served to reassure markets (as the Fed will have hoped) that stimulus-tapering does not equate to true policy-tightening, with emphasis that sub-target inflation remains a concern, that future decisions will remain data-dependent and that it can adjust to changing conditions [ie,by pausing the taper]. Definitely a rally across Europe: FTSE 100: up 72 at 6564, + 1.1% German DAX: up 127 points at 9309, +1.39% French CAC: up 60 points at 4170, +1.5% Spanish IBEX: up 209 points at 9,650, +2.2% Italian FTSE MIB: up 267 points at 18,398, + 1.4% Robin Bew of the Economist Intelligence unit predicts that the Fed's move could cause some alarm in emerging markets (EMs) next year..... While Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale analysts reckons there will be fewer jitters than last summer, when the prospect of tapering hit markets hard (although predictions of EMageddon proved wide of the mark) Here's the full list of top risers on the FTSE 100, which has settled around 1% higher as European markets join the Fed-inspired rally. No sign of taper trepidation yet.... Ishaq Siddiqi of ETC Capital reckons the \"Santa rally\"* has finally begun, and welcomes the news that the Fed is finally slowing its stimulus plan: The Fed made the right call to start tapering, removing much of the uncertainty in the market of the timeline in which it will consider taking action. This should in turn remove much of the volatility that we have seen in the final quarter of 2013, gearing us up for a delayed but eagerly anticipated \u201cSanta Rally\u201d to finish this year in a bang and kick of the next year in an upbeat fashion. The US economy is improving... the euro zone is in a better shape than it has been in over 3 years, Japan\u2019s economic policies are taking effect, China has a long term growth plan in place and the UK\u2019s economy is performing better than policymakers even anticipated \u2013 the world is not in a bad shape at all so there\u2019s much to cheer about. * - markets traditionally romp ahead in the final days of the year Europe's stock markets are open, and shares are indeed rising. The FTSE 100 is up 60 points in 6552, a gain of 0.9%, led by Prudential (up 2.5%) and BAE Systems (2%). The other main markets are also up at least 1%, as European traders take the taper in their stride. For months, we've spoken about QE being a punchbowl that central bankers were reluctant to take away. So why didn't markets tumble last night on the news that the Fed was finally tapering? Three reasons: 1) at $10bn, this is a relatively gentle taper. If the Fed continued cutting at that rate, it wouldn't stop buying bonds until beyond next summer (October) or even December (updated) 2) the Fed has said it would change the rate if conditions deteriorate; 3) and it has also indicated that interest rates will remain at record lows for more than another year. Stan Shamu of IG fleshes this out: Firstly, the Fed reinforced its low Fed funds rate outlook with the key line being \u2018it likely will be appropriate to maintain the current target range for the federal funds rate well past the time that the unemployment rate declines below 6.5%\u2019. With inflation remaining benign, the majority of Fed members expect the first rate hike in 2015. Secondly the tapering amount has been deemed by many analysts as a \u2018token taper\u2019 and essentially just allows the Fed to test the waters and assess conditions further. Thirdly, the taper has been on the back of rapidly improving conditions while the Fed reinforced that asset purchases are not on a pre-set course and will be adjusted accordingly. On this notion we can only assume that if conditions worsen, the situation will be adjusted accordingly. All things considered, a solid economic improvement for the US will help the global recovery along and ultimately company earnings along with equities. Here's the details of the rally in Japan overnight, from Reuters: Japan's Nikkei share average rose to its highest close in six years on Thursday on the back of a big drop in the yen after the U.S. Federal Reserve announced it would start unwinding its historic stimulus. Japanese equities were bolstered by a surge in the dollar/yen to over five-year highs in the wake of the Fed decision, underscoring the benefits of a weak currency for Japan's export-reliant economy.The Nikkei added 1.7% to close at 15,859.22, its highest close since Dec. 2007. During trade, it rose as high as 15,891.82, a hair's breath away from its May high of 15,942.60. It was a third day of gains for the Nikkei.The Topix gained 1.0% to 1,263.07, with all of its 33 subsectors in positive territory. Volume was high, with 2.9 billion shares changing hands.The Fed said it would reduce its monthly asset purchases by $10 billion to $75 billion, and indicated that its key interest rate would stay at rock-bottom even longer than previously promised. Good morning. World stock markets are set to rally today today after last night's historic decision by the Federal Reserve to begin scaling back its huge stimulus programme. The move to begin tapering the Fed's $85bn per month bond-buying programme by $10bn in January, alongside a new pledge to keep interest rates low for an extended period, is being taken as a sign of renewed confidence in the US economy. After five years of unprecedented stimulus measures on both side of the Atlantic, the Fed's move is a landmark moment in the financial crisis. The $10bn cut is being seen as a modest start to tapering, lighting the blue touchpaper under market optimism. Japan's stock market has hit a new six-year high overnight, and the Australian market jumped 2% (as mining stocks rose on the back of economic optimism). We're expecting a strong start to trading in Europe -- with the main indices tipped to rise almost 1% -- after Wall Street hit a record high last night. Although the Fed is starting cautiously, it sees signs of underlying strength in the US economy - and believes it can cope without such huge monthly injections of fresh money. We'll find out over time if it's right, and what the implications for the world economy will be. As Wall Street correspondent Dominic Rushe explained last night: Ben Bernanke, entering his final days as chairman of the US central bank, surprised many economists who had expected the Fed to wait until the new year to \u201ctaper\u201d the so-called quantitative easing (QE) stimulus program. But following a series of strong jobs growth numbers the Fed\u2019s open markets committee said \u201ccumulative progress\u201d had been made in the US\u2019s economic recovery and it was scaling back its $85bn a month bond-buying programme to $75bn. \"In light of the cumulative progress toward maximum employment and the improvement in the outlook for labour market conditions, the committee decided to modestly reduce the pace of its asset purchases,\u201d the Fed said in a statement. At a press conference Bernanke said he expected the Fed to take \u201csimilar moderate steps\u201d throughout 2014, suggesting the programme could end by late next year. However he cautioned that the Fed would halt the cutbacks if the economic indicators worsened. More here: Federal Reserve to taper economic stimulus on heels of strong jobs growth Emerging economics could still be watching nervously, as the recent inward flow of capital could reverse, and their currencies could weaken. But there's been no panic in emerging markets yet..... And with UK unemployment falling so much yesterday, and European ministers hammering out the details of banking union overnight (of which more shortly), 2014 looks a little less daunting....

      "bodyText": "National Grid is to encourage businesses to reduce their electricity use between 4pm and 8pm in an attempt to head off the possibility of wider power blackouts next winter. The move underlines growing fears about insufficient supply over the next year and the cost of the initiative will be passed on to consumers, the energy regulator, Ofgem, said on Thursday. It said a future reduction in potential power capacity margins to 2% mainly stemmed from older coal-fired power stations closing sooner than expected as a result of new environmental regulations from Brussels. \"Britain has one of the most reliable power systems in the world, but with margins tightening there can be no room for industry complacency on security of supply,\" said Ofgem's chief executive, Andrew Wright. \"Therefore we have approved these new tools to act as an extra insurance policy that is available for National Grid to protect consumers' power supplies.\" Businesses will be encouraged to cut their power use on weekday evenings during the winter months in return for cash discounts through a tender to be run next year. Ofgem said National Grid, the publicly traded company that runs the transmission pylons and pipes, would only be allowed to pass on the costs incurred to consumers \"in an efficient and economic manner\". The company has estimated that the likely cost of running the energy-saving scheme would be less than \u00a31 a year per household, Ofgem said. \"If National Grid does not need to procure these services, there would be no cost to the consumers,\" it added. National Grid will also be able to agree contracts with power stations to bring extra reserve energy on stream at periods of peak demand. Mothballed gas-fired plants run by companies such as Centrica, the owner of British Gas, would compete for special contracts. Meanwhile, statistics from the Department of Energy and Climate Change show that low-carbon power including nuclear, biomass and wind provided 37% of Britain's electricity over the last three months. The biggest boost came from huge former coal-burning plants such as Drax in North Yorkshire which have converted to burning wood and other biomass materials, the statistics show. The amount produced by biomass was up by a quarter while offshore wind's contribution rose by just under 7.5%. The impact of unpredictable weather on renewable energy was underlined as onshore wind's contribution dropped by 7.6% \u2013 despite capacity being up by 25% \u2013 as a result of lower wind speeds. Hydropower also slumped as a result of low rainfall. Nuclear plants generated almost 24% of low-carbon energy over the third quarter, compared with 34% during the same period of 2012. The statistics were released as the government gave out more details of low-carbon energy projects earmarked for fast-track subsidies under the new Energy Act which obtained royal assent on Wednesday. The conversion of more capacity at Drax from coal to biomass was given the provisional green light along with a string of large offshore windfarm schemes championed by Dong Energy of Denmark. A couple of onshore wind farms were also on the list as \"provisionally affordable\" but ministers also angered some renewable-power executives by indicating that onshore wind projects might be subject to an auction scheme under which they would have to bid for limited funds.",

      "bodyText": "European leaders opened a two-day Brussels summit on Thursday with Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, facing stiff resistance to her plan to force structural reforms on the ailing economies of the eurozone. The summit was preceded early on Thursday by EU finance ministers agreeing on a compromise on how to rescue weak eurozone banks, or close down rotten ones. While ministers and senior EU officials hailed the accord as \"revolutionary\" and \"historic\", the complicated deal, resisted by Germany, meant there would be no quick leap to a common eurozone system of bailing out bad banks. Germany had resisted key elements of the bank resolution plans for 18 months, but yielded slightly by agreeing to phase in pooled responsibility for the eurozone over a decade from 2015. It foiled French-led attempts to have the eurozone's \u20ac500bn bailout fund serve as a \"fiscal backstop\" for winding up or recapitalising bad banks. \"We wanted a backstop,\" said Pierre Moscovici, the French finance minister. \"We are working on its definition, which will evolve over time.\" The German finance minister, Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble, said: \"The final pillar for the banking union has been achieved.\" But the deal is likely to run into trouble in the European parliament as well as in some national parliaments. While Berlin has not been keen to Europeanise authority over eurozone banks, it is keen to entrench a new system of \"legally binding contracts'' obliging single-currency member states to implement structural reforms. The banking shift and the reform contracts, taken together, amount to the biggest moves attempted by the 17 governments of the single currency since the euro and sovereign debt crisis exploded four years ago. But the policies are highly contentious and divisive. \"They are trying to solve a German problem,\" said a senior EU official. The contracts scheme is Merkel's idea, aimed at making weaker eurozone economies more competitive. It is fiercely resisted even by her northern allies in the euro crisis, such as the Dutch, the Austrians, and the Finns. It is feared by the French and the southern Europeans. But Berlin is making plain that there will not be progress on banking union unless she makes headway on the contracts. \"Ideologically, there is some kind of connection for the Germans,\" said a senior EU diplomat involved in the fraught negotiations. Another senior diplomat said Berlin was making the linkage \"very explicit\". In a briefing before the summit, a senior German official barely mentioned the new banking regime, while dwelling at length on the need for the binding reform contracts. Merkel is keen to push the scheme because she believes not enough has yet been done to immunise the eurozone against a new crisis and also to force greater competitiveness on the rest of Europe, not least France, Berlin's biggest worry. She has already backed down considerably from last year, when the initial idea was to have legally binding contracts forcing changes to pension systems, education systems and labour markets, policed by the EU and with lagging governments at risk of being sued in the European court of justice. \"The initial idea was a German straitjacket. That's dead,\" said the senior official. Now the talk is of \"partnership\" and \"national ownership\" of the reform contracts which would be greased by \"solidarity\" payments. But it is not clear how much money is involved, whether it takes the form of loans or grants, or where it comes from (not the EU budget). The senior German official said the money available would be limited. \"We're interested in making the contracts binding. We think that's right if we want to move beyond the current system based only on recommendations.\" The creditors in the eurozone bailouts, the northerners, are against this because they see it as the thin end of the wedge in the creation of a eurozone budget and \"transfer union\". And the southerners want the money without being coerced into reforms, particularly in Paris where the president, Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, would struggle with the implicit loss of national sovereignty over economic and fiscal policy. \"It's a Germanic view of how to do structural reform. Everyone else is against it,\" said one of the senior diplomats. \"There's quite a lot tension. It will be a long, bitter and twisted debate.\"",

      "bodyText": "The outsourcing firm Serco has agreed to repay \u00a368.5m plus VAT after overcharging on its contract to provide electronic tagging of offenders, the justice secretary, Chris Grayling, hasdisclosed . The scale of overcharging \u2013 which included invoicing for the tagging of offenders who were not being monitored, some of whom were already back in prison or had died \u2013 is several times larger than previously thought. The original figure was believed to be \u00a315m-\u00a320m for the contracts held by both Serco and the security company G4S; the latter has yet to reach agreement on how much it will repay. Both contracts are now the subject of criminal investigation by the Serious Fraud Office (SFO). Serco has also agreed to repay \u00a32m in past profits on a separate prisoner escort contract after it was found that its staff had been recording prisoners as delivered \"ready for court\" when they were not. In a move that will deepen concerns over the privatisation of justice contracts, Grayling announced that he had referred two more G4S contracts, involving facilities management for the courts, to the SFO to establish whether any dishonesty had taken place. The justice secretary told MPs that both Serco and G4S, two of the government's largest private-sector suppliers, had withdrawn their bids to be lead providers in the privatisation of the probation service. A wider Cabinet Office review of the contracts held by Serco and G4S, published on Thursday, found \"potentially significant\" errors or irregularities in three payment-by-results contracts for the Department of Work and Pensions work programme to support the long-term unemployed. The announcement by Grayling of further investigations is a blow to both companies, which hoped to draw a line under the tagging scandal . Serco told the stock market yesterday that the cost of its external reviews and audits since the overcharging was disclosed in July had reached \u00a317m. The justice secretary Grayling told MPs: \"From the outset I made clear that I intended to take robust action to deal with evidence of unacceptable conduct by suppliers under my department's contracts, and to recover any monies overpaid as a result of these practices.\" Grayling said the \u00a368.5m would reimburse the government for money owed on the tagging contract and for other costs incurred, such as the cost of the investigation, which included a forensic audit undertaken by the external auditors PwC. He claimed it was a good deal for the taxpayer, adding: \"With all full and final settlements, in the event of criminality being established with material impact, we would look again at our contractual position.\" G4S said it continued to \"engage constructively\" with the Ministry of Justice over the tagging contracts. It said that an extensive review since July of its major contracts had not identified any other significant issues and it did not anticipate that the financial exposure of the two court contracts would affect the company's overall finances. G4S added that it had been advised by the ministry that it did not have any evidence of dishonesty in relation to the court contracts, and nor did G4S. The decision by Serco and G4S to withdraw as \"lead providers\" from the competition to privatise 70% of the work of the probation service is a setback to the government's plans to introduce its rehabilitation reforms by the next election. Both companies are regarded as the biggest players in the criminal justice market and would have been expected to play a significant role in the reforms. Grayling, who has said he wants to see a greater diversity of private and voluntary sector providers, told MPs he would leave open the possibility that in future both companies might play a supporting role, working with smaller businesses or voluntary sector providers. This would depend on their progress in \"achieving corporate renewal\". Frances Crook, of the Howard League for Penal Reform, said the withdrawal of the companies as prime contractors for probation \"must be the death-knell for the government's dangerous gamble with justice privatisation\". She said: \"The coalition's plan to sell off probation has succeeded only in destabilising the public probation service, which has served the public well for more than 100 years. We hope that at the eleventh hour, this excellent service can now be saved.\" The shadow justice secretary, Sadiq Khan, said the firms should have been barred from any more justice contracts in July when the scandal came to light. \"Outrageously, instead of ministers grasping the nettle, it has been left to G4S and Serco to rule themselves out of contracts, a decision neither company should ever have been left to take,\" he said. \"David Cameron's probation privatisation gamble risks turning into a disaster. It is disgraceful they are going ahead and still allowing both companies to play a supporting role.\" Alastair Lyons, Serco's chairman, \"The contract issues that were identified should never have happened and we apologise unreservedly for them. We are doing everything in our power to make sure that such issues cannot reoccur anywhere in our business around the world. Our objective is to deliver excellent public services with openness and transparency, and I believe the actions we are taking will support this now more than ever.\"",

The original figure was believed to be \u00a315m-\u00a320m for the contracts held by both Serco and the security company G4S; the latter has yet to reach agreement on how much it will repay.</p> <p>Both contracts are now the subject of criminal investigation by the Serious Fraud Office (SFO).</p> <p>Serco has also agreed to repay \u00a32m in past profits on a separate prisoner escort contract after it was found that its staff had been recording prisoners as delivered \"ready for court\" when they were not.</p> <p>In a move that will deepen concerns over the privatisation of justice contracts, Grayling announced that he had referred two more G4S contracts, involving facilities management for the courts, to the SFO to establish whether any dishonesty had taken place.</p> <p>The justice secretary told MPs that both Serco and G4S, two of the government's largest private-sector suppliers, had withdrawn their bids to be lead providers in the privatisation of the probation service.</p> <p>A wider Cabinet Office review of the contracts held by Serco and G4S, published on Thursday, found \"potentially significant\" errors or irregularities in three payment-by-results contracts for the Department of Work and Pensions work programme to support the long-term unemployed.</p> <p>The announcement by Grayling of further investigations is a blow to both companies, which hoped to draw a line under the tagging scandal . Serco told the stock market yesterday that the cost of its external reviews and audits since the overcharging was disclosed in July had reached \u00a317m.</p> <p>The justice secretary Grayling told MPs: \"From the outset I made clear that I intended to take robust action to deal with evidence of unacceptable conduct by suppliers under my department's contracts, and to recover any monies overpaid as a result of these practices.\"</p> <p>Grayling said the \u00a368.5m would reimburse the government for money owed on the tagging contract and for other costs incurred, such as the cost of the investigation, which included a forensic audit undertaken by the external auditors PwC.</p> <p>He claimed it was a good deal for the taxpayer, adding: \"With all full and final settlements, in the event of criminality being established with material impact, we would look again at our contractual position.\"</p> <p>G4S said it continued to \"engage constructively\" with the Ministry of Justice over the tagging contracts. It said that an extensive review since July of its major contracts had not identified any other significant issues and it did not anticipate that the financial exposure of the two court contracts would affect the company's overall finances. G4S added that it had been advised by the ministry that it did not have any evidence of dishonesty in relation to the court contracts, and nor did G4S.</p> <p>The decision by Serco and G4S to withdraw as \"lead providers\" from the competition to privatise 70% of the work of the probation service is a setback to the government's plans to introduce its rehabilitation reforms by the next election. Both companies are regarded as the biggest players in the criminal justice market and would have been expected to play a significant role in the reforms.</p> <p>Grayling, who has said he wants to see a greater diversity of private and voluntary sector providers, told MPs he would leave open the possibility that in future both companies might play a supporting role, working with smaller businesses or voluntary sector providers. This would depend on their progress in \"achieving corporate renewal\".</p> <p>Frances Crook, of the Howard League for Penal Reform, said the withdrawal of the companies as prime contractors for probation \"must be the death-knell for the government's dangerous gamble with justice privatisation\".</p> <p>She said: \"The coalition's plan to sell off probation has succeeded only in destabilising the public probation service, which has served the public well for more than 100 years. We hope that at the eleventh hour, this excellent service can now be saved.\"</p> <p>The shadow justice secretary, Sadiq Khan, said the firms should have been barred from any more justice contracts in July when the scandal came to light.</p> <p>\"Outrageously, instead of ministers grasping the nettle, it has been left to G4S and Serco to rule themselves out of contracts, a decision neither company should ever have been left to take,\" he said. \"David Cameron's probation privatisation gamble risks turning into a disaster. It is disgraceful they are going ahead and still allowing both companies to play a supporting role.\"</p> <p>Alastair Lyons, Serco's chairman, \"The contract issues that were identified should never have happened and we apologise unreservedly for them. We are doing everything in our power to make sure that such issues cannot reoccur anywhere in our business around the world. Our objective is to deliver excellent public services with openness and transparency, and I believe the actions we are taking will support this now more than ever.\"</p>",

Share prices rose and bond markets \u2013 thought to be vulnerable to any move by the US central bank \u2013 shrugged off the news. Clearly, the start of the long-awaited taper is a significant event. But it does not mean the Fed has turned hawkish. For a start, the quantitative easing programme continues, albeit at a marginally slower pace of $75bn (\u00a346bn) a month rather than $85bn. It will be the end of next year on current plans before the tapering process ends. In addition, the Fed has softened an already doveish stance on interest rates by announcing that it intends to keep official borrowing costs at rock-bottom levels until well after the jobless rate falls below its 6.5% threshold level. This is a tapering but not a tightening, which is why stock markets responded positively to a decision only a minority of analysts predicted. In truth, it was easy to see why the decision was taken. The recent news from the US has been good. Jobs are being created at a fair lick, consumers are spending money in the shopping malls, growth is currently the strongest for any G7 economy. The uneasy peace on Capitol Hill means there is no longer the threat of a government shutdown and tax increases and spending cuts will cease to be the drag on activity in 2014 that they have been this year. There were two other reasons for the move. Officials at the Fed have started to question whether quantitative easing \u2013 buying US Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities in return for cash \u2013 has been an effective way of reviving the economy. The Fed is now sitting on trillions of dollars of bonds and would make enormous losses in the event of a bond-market crash. Then there's Ben Bernanke's legacy. The outgoing chairman of the Fed, an expert on the economic policy blunders of the 1930s, has pursued an ultra-stimulative approach in his determination to avoid a second Great Depression. But he does not want to be blamed, as Alan Greenspan was, for creating bubbles by leaving too much stimulus in place for too long. He can now say that he initiated the winding down of QE before handing the reins over to Janet Yellen. Does the Fed's decision have ramifications for other central banks? Not really, because all the major economies are at different stages of the economic cycle and have their own particular challenges to address. The one common factor is that central banks are winging it. Zero interest rates and QE were the response to a sluggish recovery, a broken financial system, heavily indebted consumers and the threat of deflation. But having created a world of stimulus junkies, central bankers are faced with the tricky decision of how to reduce the dosage. The answer from the Fed is plain: slowly and with great caution.",

      "bodyText": "Britain's annual Christmas shopping season got off to a slow start in November as cautious consumers waited for bargains or shopped online. Figures from the Office for National Statistics showed that retail sales last month were 0.3% up on October, weaker than had been suggested by surveys of the high street. The ONS said falling sales in department stores and at petrol stations had offset a strong performance by clothing stores, where sales of winter lines were helped by colder weather. The proportion of business done by retailers online rose by 1.4 percentage points to 11.9% \u2013 the highest on record. Over the three months to November, a better guide to the underlying trend, retail sales volumes were unchanged on the previous three months. In recent years, the pattern has been for consumers to delay Christmas shopping until December, awaiting bargain offers from shops and stores seeking to offload their stocks of goods. But analysts believe the muted start to the traditional festive spending spree also reflects the squeeze on real incomes caused by prices rising more rapidly than earnings. Howard Archer, UK economist at IHS Global Insight, said: \"With purchasing power being limited by consumer price inflation running well above earnings growth for a prolonged period, it is likely that many people have felt the need to control their spending after spending at a rapid rate in the third quarter. \"With the CBI distributive sales survey indicating that retail sales gained appreciable momentum in the first half of December, this may yet turn out to be a reasonable Christmas overall for retailers despite the lacklustre November performance, but it is questionable at this stage. \"Consequently, many retailers may still feel compelled to engage in significant discounting and promotions over the final few days before Christmas to try and give a final lift to sales.\"",

      "standfirst": "<strong>Analysis</strong>: The main issue is what German chancellor Angela Merkel wants, what she doesn't want and what she might get", 
      "body": "<p>European leaders gather in Brussels on Thursday for a two-day summit aimed at shoring up the euro, pooling economic reform efforts and entrenching a radical new regime for controlling most of the eurozone banking sector. The summit begins after late-night negotiations in Brussels saw finance ministers thrash out a complicated compromise deal that left national governments ultimately responsible for bailing out their banks.</p> <p>Taken together, the policies amount to the biggest moves attempted by the 17 governments of the single currency since the euro and sovereign debt crisis exploded four years ago. The action being plotted is highly contentious, the policies are divisive. The main issue is what chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany wants, what she does not want, and what she might get in the end.</p> <p>\"They are trying to solve a German problem,\" said a senior EU official.</p> <p>The two main innovations are agreements on a key pillar of a new \"banking union\" that makes the European Central Bank the supervisory authority for the big systemic eurozone banks from next year and a new system of \"binding\" contracts agreed at the eurozone level to encourage structural reforms in individual countries.</p> <p>The Germans have resisted and sought to dilute the banking union since Merkel was hijacked at a summit in June last year by France, Italy and Spain and the new regime was agreed. By contrast, the contracts scheme is Merkel's idea, aimed at making weaker eurozone economies more competitive. It is fiercely resisted even by her northern allies in the euro crisis, such as the Dutch, the Austrians, and the Finns. It is feared by the French and the southern Europeans.</p> <p>But Berlin is making plain that there won't be progress on banking union unless she makes headway on the contracts.</p> <p>\"Ideologically, there is some kind of connection for the Germans,\" said a senior EU diplomat involved in the fraught negotiations. Another senior diplomat said Berlin was making the linkage \"very explicit\".</p> <p>The big contested points on the new banking regime boil down to who foots the bill for a rotten bank or to recapitalise and restructure a failing bank and who has the final word on winding up a bank.</p> <p>\"We've been talking about banking union for months,\" Merkel told German television. \"We Germans have laid down very clear conditions. I do see a chance that we can make it. I just don't know for sure yet.\"</p> <p>The Germans have been relatively isolated in their demands, but appear to be carrying the day. Since Lehman Brothers in 2008, European taxpayers have shelled out \u20ac1.6tn (\u00a31.3tn) via government bank rescues. Arguing on grounds of moral hazard, Berlin insists that era is over. The banks will themselves, via a levy, supply their own insurance, a \u20ac55bn pot that, however, will not be available until 2025 at the earliest.

      "bodyText": "European leaders gather in Brussels on Thursday for a two-day summit aimed at shoring up the euro, pooling economic reform efforts and entrenching a radical new regime for controlling most of the eurozone banking sector. The summit begins after late-night negotiations in Brussels saw finance ministers thrash out a complicated compromise deal that left national governments ultimately responsible for bailing out their banks. Taken together, the policies amount to the biggest moves attempted by the 17 governments of the single currency since the euro and sovereign debt crisis exploded four years ago. The action being plotted is highly contentious, the policies are divisive. The main issue is what chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany wants, what she does not want, and what she might get in the end. \"They are trying to solve a German problem,\" said a senior EU official. The two main innovations are agreements on a key pillar of a new \"banking union\" that makes the European Central Bank the supervisory authority for the big systemic eurozone banks from next year and a new system of \"binding\" contracts agreed at the eurozone level to encourage structural reforms in individual countries. The Germans have resisted and sought to dilute the banking union since Merkel was hijacked at a summit in June last year by France, Italy and Spain and the new regime was agreed. By contrast, the contracts scheme is Merkel's idea, aimed at making weaker eurozone economies more competitive. It is fiercely resisted even by her northern allies in the euro crisis, such as the Dutch, the Austrians, and the Finns. It is feared by the French and the southern Europeans. But Berlin is making plain that there won't be progress on banking union unless she makes headway on the contracts. \"Ideologically, there is some kind of connection for the Germans,\" said a senior EU diplomat involved in the fraught negotiations. Another senior diplomat said Berlin was making the linkage \"very explicit\". The big contested points on the new banking regime boil down to who foots the bill for a rotten bank or to recapitalise and restructure a failing bank and who has the final word on winding up a bank. \"We've been talking about banking union for months,\" Merkel told German television. \"We Germans have laid down very clear conditions. I do see a chance that we can make it. I just don't know for sure yet.\" The Germans have been relatively isolated in their demands, but appear to be carrying the day. Since Lehman Brothers in 2008, European taxpayers have shelled out \u20ac1.6tn (\u00a31.3tn) via government bank rescues. Arguing on grounds of moral hazard, Berlin insists that era is over. The banks will themselves, via a levy, supply their own insurance, a \u20ac55bn pot that, however, will not be available until 2025 at the earliest. Also, bank investors, creditors and shareholders will themselves have to step up to the plate and pay for failure before governments. The Germans have been resisting any common \"fiscal backstop\" for bank resolution, such as the \u20ac500bn bailout fund, and have been determined to avoid liability for others' banks until 2025. The French lead the opposition here. Merkel and President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande wrestled over the issue on Wednesday in Paris hours after she was sworn in for her third term as chancellor, while EU and eurozone finance ministers capped a fortnight of frantic late-night negotiations with more scrapping in Brussels. Points victory for Berlin The result was a points victory for Berlin, a complicated compromise that phases in a common fund by 2025 but until then leaves bank rescues mainly a national matter. The deal also produced a complex decision-taking system that leaves the final word on bank rescues with national governments. The two fundamental aims of the banking union are to break the toxic loop between bad banks and sovereign debt that contributed hugely to the euro crisis and to shift liability for failure away from taxpayers to the financial sector itself. Both aims look likely to be unfulfilled for a long time. Responsibility for banking fecklessness will remain mainly national for years to come, at German insistence, meaning partial government bailouts and taxpayer involvement. And because of quarrels over who decides to wind up a bank, the EU or its governments, the compromise is messy involving the European commission, a new banking resolution board and national finance ministers. Mario Draghi, the head of the ECB, voiced his exasperation to the European Parliament this week. \"I am concerned that decision-making may become overly complex and financing arrangements may not be adequate \u2026 We should not create a Single Resolution Mechanism that is single in name only,\" he said. He demanded \"a single system, a single authority, and a single fund\". \"One can't have hundreds of people consulting each other about whether a certain bank is viable.\" \"Under the likely agreement, the process of bank resolution will be political and complex, while the costs will primarily be borne by the private sector and national budgets in the short and medium term,\" said Mujtaba Rahman, analyst at Eurasia Group. \"The deal will be a bad one, as lead European negotiators do not wish to upset the Germans.\" Things get even more unwieldy because, again to accommodate German constitutional concerns, the new system will be based on both new EU legislation as well as an international treaty between participating governments. There will be a battle with the European Parliament and there may be national problems getting the treaty ratified, all of which indicates delays which suit Berlin. Merkel is much keener to push her structural reforms contracts scheme because she believes not enough has yet been done to immunize the eurozone against a new crisis and also to force greater competitiveness on the rest of Europe, not least France, Berlin's biggest worry. She has already backed down considerably from last year when the initial idea was to have legally binding contracts forcing changes to pension systems, education systems, or labour markets, policed by the EU and where lagging governments could be sued in the European Court of Justice. \"The initial idea was a German straitjacket. That's dead,\" said the senior official. Now the talk is of \"partnership\" and \"national ownership\" of the reform contracts which would be greased by \"solidarity\" payments. But it is not clear how much money is involved, whether it takes the form of loans or grants, where it comes from (not the EU budget). A senior German official said the money available will be \"limited.\" \"We're interested in making the contracts binding. We think that's right if we want to move beyond the current system based only on recommendations.\" The creditors in the eurozone bailouts, the northerners, are against this because they see it as the thin end of the wedge in the creation of a eurozone budget and \"transfer union\". And the southerners want the money without being coerced into reforms, particularly in Paris where Hollande would struggle with the implicit loss of national sovereignty over economic and fiscal policy. \"It's a Germanic view of how to do structural reform. Everyone else is against it,\" said one of the senior diplomats. \"There's quite a lot tension. It will be a long, bitter and twisted debate.\"",

      "bodyText": "EU finance ministers announced late on Wednesday night that they had reached agreement on a new system for dealing with eurozone banks, under intense pressure to seal the accord on their new flagship policy in advance of a two-day Brussels summit opening on Thursday. EU officials announced a \"crucial breakthrough\" on a fiscal backstop for rescuing or winding up failing banks in the Eurozone at 3am on Wednesday. But the details were inconclusive from the meeting of the Eurozone countries and were still being haggled over by all 28 EU finance ministers in Brussels 18 hours later. All the signs were that Germany had prevailed in its reluctance to assent to any pooled liability for the eurozone banking sector under the new regime of eurozone supervision known as the banking union. The key issues were: who pays to wind up or recapitalise a failing eurozone bank, and who decides when a bank should be closed down. EU officials said the breakthrough meant a \"common\" or pooled eurozone backstop would be available for dealing with troubled banks. The common backstop would not be available until 2025 at the earliest and would consist of a \u20ac55bn (\u00a346bn) pot of money raised by the banks themselves via a levy over the decade from 2015. In the meantime, Germany conceded that the eurozone's \u20ac500bn bailout fund, the European stability mechanism, could be used as a last resort for rescuing failed banks if governments did not have enough money. Earlier the agreement had looked fragile, hedged with conditions and caveats, and was attacked as inadequate by the European Central Bank, whose credibility is at stake as the new supervisor of most of the eurozone banking sector under the new regime. EU leaders need to agree on the banking wind-up arrangements, known as the single resolution mechanism and the single resolution fund, at their summit on Thursday and Friday if the deadlines for getting the new system operational are to be met. Two weeks of late-night meetings in Brussels and Berlin have pushed issues to the brink. There will be big problems with getting the deals agreed with the European parliament, and with national ratifications of a new treaty between participating governments on the funding of banking resolution. The French-led group of southern countries, the European commission and the ECB opposed this. \"It's a choice between a banking union that's not perfect, or nothing,\" said a senior EU official. In the transitional decade, from 2015, the issue is what happens in a banking crisis. On German insistence, there will be no European response except as a last resort; nor will there be any escape from adding to national debt burdens to fund a bailout.

      "bodyText": "David Cameron seized on news of a sharp fall in unemployment on Wednesday as evidence that the coalition's economic plan is working, while City analysts warned that the rapid improvement in the labour market could trigger an earlier-than-expected rise in interest rates. Mark Carney, governor of the Bank of England, has pledged to leave borrowing costs on hold at 0.5% at least until the unemployment rate hits a \"threshold\" of 7%. But since that policy was announced in August, employment has risen much faster than he expected. Official figures showed that the unemployment rate fell to a four-and-a-half year low of 7.4% in the three months to October, down from 7.7% between May and July, prompting economists to predict that the Bank's threshold could be hit within months. Threadneedle Street has forecast that the threshold could be reached in 2015. \"The jobless rate is falling far faster towards the Bank of England's 7% threshold than policymakers envisaged,\" said Chris Williamson, chief economist at City data provider Markit. \"Employment is surging higher and unemployment collapsing in the UK as the economic recovery has moved into a higher gear.\" Speaking in the Commons, the prime minister said: \"The plan is working, let's stick at it, and get unemployment down even further\". He added: \"there should not be one ounce of complacency because we have still got work to do to get our country back to work and everyone back in work means greater stability for them, greater ability to plan for their future, greater help for their families.\" Allan Monks, UK economist at JP Morgan, said the news had prompted him to bring forward his forecast for a rate rise to the first quarter of 2015; but warned that, \"the risks of an even earlier hike have increased\". Carney has sought to stress that the jobs threshold is only a \"staging post\", and would not trigger an automatic rise in rates. But independent Bank policymaker Martin Weale said last week that \"rapidly falling unemployment\" would strengthen the case for higher rates. The details of the jobs data reinforced the view that the labour market has improved markedly over the past six months. The number of people employed across the economy has hit a fresh record high, above 30 million, while there are more vacancies than at any time since the summer of 2008, before the UK slipped into recession. On the claimant count, which measures the number of people receiving out-of-work benefits, unemployment fell to 1.27 million in November, its lowest level since January 2009. John Philpott, director of the Jobs Economist consultancy, described the data as \"wonderful\". \"The quarterly 250,000 net increase in total employment is as big as one might once have expected in a full year. Employment is up in all parts of the UK, except Northern Ireland, with a sharp rise in job vacancies helping an additional 50,000 16 to 24-year-olds into work. And while the overall figure of more than 30 million people in work still leaves the UK employment rate [72%] below the pre-recession rate [73%] it is a landmark worth celebrating,\" he said. Despite the improving conditions in the labour market, there was little evidence that the prolonged squeeze on wages is easing, however. The ONS said total pay rose at an annual rate of 0.9% in October, or 0.8% including bonuses. That compares with an inflation rate of 2.2% in the same month, suggesting that on average, living standards are continuing to fall. Frances O'Grady, the general secretary of the TUC, said: \"These are undoubtedly positive figures, but we should not forget how far we still have to go to restore pre-crash living standards through better pay and jobs.\" Rachel Reeves, the shadow work and pensions secretary, said: \"Today's fall in unemployment is welcome, but families are facing a cost-of-living crisis and on average working people are now \u00a31,600 a year worse off under this out-of-touch government.\" The relentless fall in real wages may help to explain why consumer confidence has actually fallen over the past month, for the first time in a year, according to a new survey published on Thursday. Pollsters YouGov and City consultancy the Centre for Economic Business and Research say their consumer confidence index has slipped to 109.5 in December, from 110 in November. They suggest property prices have been a key driver of the more upbeat mood among consumers in 2013. Stephen Harmston, of YouGov, said: \"This month's fall in consumer confidence highlights the fact that the economic recovery is far from being a done deal in the eyes of many people. The surge in house prices in the last year has inflated consumer confidence, masking the underlying economic fragility in people's day to day lives\".",
