Following his efforts to bring down the value of the Swiss franc against the dollar and the euro, Hildebrand had been under sustained attack from the far-right Swiss People's party (SVP). The SNB shocked foreign exchange markets last September when it imposed a cap on the value of the franc against the euro to stop the currency soaring and thereby hurting Swiss exporters' earnings. SVP vice-president Christoph Blocher attacked the intervention in currency markets as a waste of precious Swiss francs. A weekly newspaper close to the SVP, Die Weltwoche, claimed to have access to banking documents showing that in March alone Hildebrand bought US dollars worth SFr1.1m. Bank Sarasin, which allegedly handled the transactions, said an employee had leaked client information by transmitting banking details to a lawyer close to the SVP. It said the member of staff had left the bank and could face prosecution. Die Weltwoche said the same employee had lodged a complaint against Hildebrand for alleged insider trading. Christoph M\u00f6rgeli, a politician from the SVP, welcomed Hildebrand's resignation. \"There was nothing left for him to do,\" he told Reuters. The SNB's supervisory council said in a statement that its vice chairman, Thomas Jordan, who joined the central bank in 1997, would take over as chairman for the time being and the vacancy on the three-person governing board would be filled as soon as possible. The board, previously made up of Hildebrand, Jordan and Jean-Pierre Danthine, reiterated that the cap on the Swiss franc at 1.20 to the euro, which was imposed on 6 September, would be retained \"with utmost determination\". Hildebrand had been due to appear before the parliamentary economics committee alongside the head of the SNB's supervisory council, Hansueli Raggenbass, who is also under pressure over the affair. \"As we suggested last week, Hildebrand's position was almost untenable, and so it has proved,\" said Tony Nyman of Informa Global Markets. \"The Swiss franc has actually gained on the news, possibly due to hopes of increased integrity ahead, but also market positioning too.\" The Swiss franc, which Hildebrand has fought to stop soaring on safe-haven buying driven by the eurozone debt crisis, rose on the announcement, trading up 0.1% at 1.2138 per euro. \"From a policy point of view there will be no change and the Swiss franc will revert to where it was before the knee-jerk reaction,\" said Gavin Friend, an analyst at National Australia Bank.",

Meanwhile, yields on 10-year Italian government bonds remain at levels close to 7% \u2013 regarded as unsustainable in the long term. David Cameron, who has ruled the UK out of the EU treaty that Merkel and Sarkozy hope will help solve the crisis through greater fiscal union, waded in to urge eurozone leaders to take \"pretty decisive steps\" to keep the euro alive. He is opposing the financial transaction tax that France and Germany appear to be willing to implement, although French banks, through the French Bank Federation, warned they might shift overseas if it were imposed. Merkel insisted that no country should be forced out of the eurozone as Sarkozy stressed that the \"fiscal compact\" would be ready to allow a new treaty to be signed on 1 March. The German leader, facing the prospect that the eurozone is falling back into recession, also stressed that growth was on the agenda. She said: \"Budget consolidation is one of the legs Europe's future must be built on, but of course we need a second leg and that is ... the question of economic growth, jobs and employment.\" The markets are awaiting news of any downgrade of France's triple-A debt rating, which is also crucial for the rating of the European Financial Stability Facility \u2013 Europe's bailout fund. Analysts at BNP Paribas noted that by 17 January, Moody's has to decide whether to change its outlook to \"negative\" on France. Its fellow rating agencies Standard &amp; Poor's and Fitch have already warned of the risk of a downgrade. Official data showed that Germany's trade surplus rose in November, demonstrating that the country was still able to keep its export market buoyant. France was also able to report higher exports in November, although imports were flat, shrinking its trade deficit. Jane Foley, currency expert at Rabobank, said: \"Better than expected German trade data is a reminder that for the eurozone the softer euro exchange rate is not all bad news\".",

      "bodyText": "The entertainment group HMV insisted that it would remain a high street fixture for years to come after improved trading over the crucial Christmas fortnight bought it some breathing space. Like-for-like sales fell 8.1% over the five weeks to 31 December, which was an improving \"trajectory\" said chief executive Simon Fox. When it updated investors in the week before Christmas sales were running down more than 13%. Fox said HMV was \"not out of the woods yet\" but added: \"It is encouraging that trading has started to improve but I wouldn't want to overplay it. Within the numbers, technology was encouraging.\" To counter falling demand for CDs, DVDs and video games, HMV has started to sell tablet computers, headphones and MP3 players. Over the five-week period like-for-like sales in technology were up 51% with the retailer selling 500,000 pairs of headphones and 20,000 tablet computers. HMV, which with 252 stores is the country's last national music chain, is hobbled by \u00a3160m of debt. Poor trading throughout 2011 meant the sale of Waterstone's for \u00a353m failed to solve its financial problems and in December it put its profitable live music division, which runs 13 venues and a number of festivals, up for sale. The company would give no update on the sale of HMV Live, which operates the Hammersmith Apollo in west London, but there is a long list of potential bidders including Time Out owner Oakley Capital, O2 arena owner AEG, Warner Music and Sony. HMV may also have to consider the disposal of its stake in digital business 7digital, though there is currently no formal process. Striking a more confident note, Fox said: \"I am confident that HMV will be around for many Christmases to come.\" He was obliged, however, to repeat last month's warning that there were \"material uncertainties\" which may cast doubt on the group's ability to continue. The retailer made a loss of \u00a345.7m in the six months to 29 October, compared with \u00a327.4m the previous year. Peel Hunt analyst John Stevenson said the figures were flattered by an extra day's trading, with expectations the retailer would break even in the year to April looking \"unattainable\", pencilling in a loss of \u00a310m. A sale of HMV Live would cut debt but not by enough to pay back an expensive \u00a390m \"B\" tranche of debt, which this time next year will attract a higher interest rate. \"A sale of the Live division is unlikely to be sufficient to both pay down the 'B' debt and provide sufficient working capital for the group,\" said Stevenson. \"Given the severe structural headwinds, we remain sellers.\" The shares, which lost 90% of their value last year, fell 0.2p to 2.9p. Fox said the Christmas sales performance was \"disappointing\" but broadly in line with internal expectations. It was a \"good\" Christmas for DVDs, which account for 45% of HMV sales, with The Inbetweeners and final instalment of the Harry Potter franchise among the bestsellers, but video games were \"weak\" with the market down 16% in December. Fox said shoppers were being frugal and that the average spend was lower than last year: \"People were very cautious and price sensitive.\" Conlumino retail analyst Neil Saunders said the fall in Christmas sales was on top of the 13.6% decline seen last year, which pointed to HMV's core business being in \"terminal decline\". \"The big problem is that with over 60% of all sales made online, the business of selling music, film and entertainment products is no longer the province of high street retailers. HMV was extremely slow to adapt to this and remains a business without a credible plan to address the issue.\"",

      "bodyText": "The dire state of the high street will be drawn into focus this week as two of the nation's best known brands will join a growing list of retail casualties. Blacks Leisure, the outdoor retailer, will be sold in a prepack administration to rival JD Sports for about \u00a320m and most of the lingerie chain La Senza will enter administration after Middle Eastern retailer Alshaya picks up about 60 of the most profitable stores. It comes as new figures show 183 retailers went into administration last year \u2013 a 10% rise on 2010 \u2013 and many more, including Hawkin's Bazaar, Past Times and Barratts Shoes, remain on the critical list. The roll call of high street failures will continue to grow this year, and many of the biggest names in retailing are preparing to announce big drops in critically-important Christmas trading. Argos, HMV and Game Group are expected to report a 10% drop in sales against last year. Even Tesco and Marks &amp; Spencer are expected to this week reveal they had a turkey of a Christmas. City experts predict Tesco, Britain's biggest supermarket chain, will deliver its worst British Christmas sales performance in decades. Tesco's house brokers, JP Morgan Cazenove and Deutsche Bank, are forecasting a 1.5-2% decline in sales from core British stores in the six weeks to 7 January. Marks &amp; Spencer, the bellwether of the high street with more than 21 million customers, is expected to post a 1.5% decline in clothing and homeware sales in the 13 weeks to 31 December. Stephen Robertson, director general of the British Retail Consortium (BRC), said the number of retail failures was \"alarming\". \"2011 was a tough year with virtually no real terms growth for retailers.

      "bodyText": "Battle lines over \"crony capitalism\" were clearly drawn up on Sunday as the prime minister called for binding shareholder votes on top executives' pay, but seemed to reject as a gimmick Labour's call for workers on remuneration committees and for companies' pay ratios to be published. Liberal Democrats stressed the importance of opening up boardroom remuneration committees to include figures who are more independent and able to restrict company heads from settling one another's pay and creating a \"crony culture\". Lib Dem sources predicted haggling with their coalition partners over the detail, in the face of business lobbying. The business secretary, Vince Cable, wants to see publication of company heads' pay as a single figure \u2013 total pay, including salary, long-term share plans, retirement schemes and other perks. He also advocates publication of the difference between chief executives' pay and that of the average worker, as well as disclosure about the proportion of company profits paid to directors. But the shadow business secretary, Chuka Umunna, said he doubted shareholders, such as pension funds, would be sufficiently interventionist to be able to curb boardroom pay. He accused David Cameron of dragging his feet, adding: \"There is no point giving shareholders a vote on executive pay without the greater transparency needed \u2013 so they can discern the aggregate remuneration executives receive under the complex arrangements currently in place.\" Cable is due to publish detailed proposals shortly, following discussions with business next week, led by a speech on responsible capitalism by his party leader, Nick Clegg, next Monday. Cameron's long-heralded intervention opens a hotly contested three-way debate between the parties on how to rein in corporate excess, and create a long-term investment culture in UK firms. The debate will be a key test of Ed Miliband's ability to dominate an agenda he claims his party naturally owns. Cameron said on Sunday that there had been a \"market failure\", with some bosses getting huge rises despite firms not improving their performance. He also promised there would be shareholder votes to tackle large payouts for executives dismissed because of poor work. He said the measures would be included in a bill in the next Queen's Speech. Speaking on the BBC he said: \"Those big rewards when people fail make people's blood boil and is actually taking money from the owners of the company, the shareholders and everyone with a pension in Britain.\" He indicated a move for more independent remuneration committee chairs, saying: \"What's happened in the past is that with a lot of chairmen sitting on each other's remuneration committees, there's been a bit of back-scratching going on and a sort of circular process of rewards being pushed up across the board.\" Labour claimed on Sunday that the government had not gone far enough, and called for workers to be on remuneration committees, an idea dismissed by Cameron as tokenistic.
