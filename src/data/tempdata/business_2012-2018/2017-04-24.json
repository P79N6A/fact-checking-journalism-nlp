      "bodyText": "Australian workers on average are working fewer hours than ever before as the shift from full-time to part-time work continues and, with it, the rise in underemployment. In March, Australian workers averaged a mere 34 hours and 40 minutes of work each week. This was just above the record low of 34 hours and 38 minutes set in June last year but is well down on the 35 hours and 14 minutes worked just five years ago: The drop in the average hours worked is a reflection of the changing nature of employment in Australia. Where once full-time was the norm, in March a record 17% of all hours worked was done by part-time employees: Nearly a third of all people employed now work part-time \u2013 a trend that has been growing ever since the 1980s. Mostly the declining average hours worked since the 1990s is due to women entering the workforce in greater numbers than before and women (as I have previously noted) are much more likely to work part-time. But more men also work part-time now than before and, crucially, both men and women who work full-time are working fewer hours than the recent past. To be classed as a full-time worker by the ABS you need to usually work more than 35 hours a week (this may be in more than one job, which is why the monthly employment data does not perfectly match the number of jobs). Before the GFC hit, male full-time employees worked on average 44.5 hours a week. Female full-time employees on average work less than men but they too were working slightly more than they do now: The decline in hours worked has mostly come from a reduction in the percentage of full-time workers working very long hours and an increase in the amount working less than 40 hours a week. In 2006, 10% of full-time workers worked more than 60 hours a week; now it is 9%. There are similar drop-offs in the number of workers working 44-49 hours and 50-59 hours a week. But the past decade has seen a rise in the level of full-time workers working under 40 hours from 30% to 34%: Now this does not necessarily mean there has been a rise in the percentage of full-time workers who consider themselves underemployed \u2013 overwhelmingly under-employed workers are those who are part-time. But an interesting thing about part-time workers is that they are now working more hours on average than in the past: The biggest shift has been the drop in the proportion of part-time employees working less than 20 hours a week: This is reflective I suspect of the shift from part-time work being viewed as a bit of a gap-filler role to one that is expected to be more crucial to the operations of the business (though not necessarily meaning a more permanent role). The data does put paid to the common complaint about the unemployment figures that, because people who work just one hour a week are counted as employed, the figures exaggerate the amount of real work. The argument has always been a bit silly \u2013 you have to count work from some point \u2013 one hour of work is an internationally standard point, so it makes sense to use it. But the data also shows that the proportion of employees working less than 10 hours a week has fallen over the past decade \u2013 and has never been a large number of workers: We could include those working under 10 hours as \u201cunemployed\u201d but all that would do is increase the unemployment rate for no other reason than because we have decided anything less than 10 hours is not real work. That might make us worry more about the problem but my suspicion is it would mean we would just think of average unemployment as being 10%-11% rather than 5%-6%: It is worth noting that while the percentage of people working less than 10 hours has fallen, the level of underemployment has risen. And, given the real concern is actual people being employed, it would only make sense to use a different measure if the current one was hiding something. But a comparison of the annual growth of all employment and employment excluding work of less than 10 hours a week shows almost no difference: Underemployment is a big issue but it is not being driven by more people working very small numbers of hours. The data suggests the bigger issue is that work that once was done by full-time employees is now being taken on by those who work part-time. This has seen the proportion of workers employed full-time fall, while also causing a rise in the hours worked by part-time workers. But with underemployment at record highs, it is clear what many part-time workers really want is not just a few more hours work but full-time employment.",

      "bodyText": "The government appears to have performed a weekend U-turn on business rates and says a \u00a3300m relief fund to help small businesses worst hit by the shakeup is now available for councils to share out. On Friday the Guardian was told by the Department for Communities and Local Government that although the consultation on how to distribute the money was complete it would require the approval of the new government \u2013 signalling a hiatus of several months until after the 8 June general election. However, speaking in the House of Commons on Monday the communities secretary, Sajid Javid, insisted there would be \u201cabsolutely no delay because of the general election\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s going ahead, exactly as planned. Councils are free to start using the scheme and helping local businesses.\u201d The business rates revaluation triggered a furious political row in February with the government coming under fire from its own MPs over the impact of the changes in their constituencies. Many of the affected businesses are in Conservative heartlands and the pressure saw the chancellor Philip Hammond announce a \u00a3435m relief package in the budget. Half a million shopkeepers, pubs and restaurants saw their rates bills \u2013 the commercial equivalent of council tax \u2013 increase at the start of this month after a revaluation of property hit parts of the country where prices have surged. For example, a property boom in the Suffolk coastal town of Southwold forced rateable values up by 152%, with some shop owners saying the resulting hike in their rates bill threatened the viability of their businesses. Rachael Maskell, the Labour MP for York Central, described the situation created by the revaluation as \u201ctotally unfair\u201d as although more small businesses were exempt from rates in her constituency others had seen their rateable value increase by 600%. \u201cNo one knows how the new relief funds will be distributed,\u201d she said. \u201cTotal chaos.\u201d The DCLG website was updated over the weekend with the following statement added to the relevant homepage: \u201cThe government has considered the responses to the consultation on the scheme announced at spring budget 2017 for discretionary business rates relief and determined that final allocations to local authorities will be made according to the draft allocations published as part of the consultation.\u201d A DCLG spokeswoman confirmed the relief fund was now being rolled out. \u201cCouncils should establish their own schemes to distribute funds to local firms and can claim the funding from DCLG as soon as their schemes are up and running,\u201d she said. The revaluation, which is revenue neutral for the government, is supposed to make the system fairer by ensuring business rates reflect the property market with rates bills actually coming down in some parts of the country. A revaluation is supposed to take place every five years but the previous review was controversially delayed by two years with high street campaigners accusing the government of postponing the process as it would be vote loser in Tory-held seats in the south-east ahead of the 2015 general election. The last revaluation, which came into effect in 2010, was based on rental values from 2008 which explains why some firms have seen a sharp rise in their bills. Hammond\u2019s relief package comprised the \u00a3300m discretionary fund, which is spread over four years, and a \u00a31,000 discount on this year\u2019s rates bill for pubs with a rateable value of less than \u00a3100,000. It is now up to local councils, who receive funds quarterly, to decide the local businesses that need help. Local authorities have already been developing their schemes with London\u2019s Haringey, for example, where the rates of most high street shops have increased by 20% to 30%, considering giving preference to small, medium and independent firms. Mark Rigby, chief executive of business rent and rates specialists CVS, said it was important that councils acted quickly as businesses were already paying higher rates. \u201cI would now urge councils across England to expedite the distribution of this relief to those firms hardest hit by the revaluation with business rates bills having already been sent out and the first tax instalment having been collected,\u201d he said.",

      "bodyText": "Emmanuel Macron\u2019s victory in the first round of the French presidential election saw stock markets surge and the euro gain ground against the dollar and pound. The prospect of Macron beating anti-EU far right candidate Marine Le Pen - not to mention the relatively unusual sight of opinion polls making the correct call - gave some relief to investors concerned about the rise of extremism in Europe. Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at IG, said; This [market reaction] might seem a bit overdone, given Macron was always supposed to win the first round, and there is still a second round to go. Only in two weeks\u2019 time will be able to put thoughts of a Len Pen presidency behind us. However, investors seem buoyed by the consistent record of French polling, one that was reinforced by the result yesterday, and are prepared to move back into risk assets once more. Of course, this hasn\u2019t solved all the other problems, such as North Korea, Syria and the Trump administration\u2019s failure to produce any major reforms, but for now the bears have been forced to get out of the way or risk being trampled in the rush to buy stocks again. The final scores in Europe showed: The FTSE 100 finished up 150.13 points or 2.11% at 7264.68 France\u2019s Cac climbed 4.14% to 5268.85 Germany\u2019s Dax rose 3.37% to a closing high of 12,454.98 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB closed up 4.77% at 20,684.41 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended up 3.76% at 10,766.8 In Greece, the Athens market added 1.75% to 683.30 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 211 points or 1.03%. Meanwhile the euro is currently up 1.1% against the dollar and 1.3% against the pound. Here is our updated markets story: And on that note, it\u2019s time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. The prospect of Emmanuel Macron becoming France\u2019s next president has prompted the Greek prime minister Alexis Tsipras to call the centrist politician following his first-round win. Helena Smith writes: The congratulatory message from Tsipras not only underscored the strong alliance between Greece and France, but also how much store Athens sets on Paris\u2019 long-standing support in economic matters. Throughout the seven-year debt crisis, Greece has frequently depended on France\u2019s backing in often fraught negotiations with creditors, not least Berlin. After weeks of tense talks over the country\u2019s latest bailout review, monitors representing lender institutions will return to Athens to resume inspections tomorrow, European Commission spokesman Margaritis Schinas announced today. The aim was to reach an agreement \u201cas soon as possible,\u201d he said, in comments reflecting Europe\u2019s desire to avert another Greek crisis in the run-up to Germany also going to the polls. The inspection tour, which is expected to be wrapped up within weeks, will focus on the \u201ctechnical details\u201d of implementing \u20ac3.6bn worth of further pension cuts and tax hikes, the latter enforced though broad expansion of the tax base. Highlighting the extraordinary fiscal adjustment Greece has made, Schinas said the EU statistics agency, Eurostat, had confirmed that in 2016 the country\u2019s primary budget surplus far exceeded expectations coming in at 3.9% of GDP (excluding debt servicing costs). The spokesman said the Commission was confident Greece could meet its budget targets in 2017 and 2018. A couple of manufacturing surveys from the US are showing a slight dip in performance. The Dallas Fed manufacturing activity index dipped from 16.9 in March to 16.8 this month, below expectations of a rise to 17. Meanwhile the Chicago Fed national activity index for March fell from a 0.27 increase in February to a 0.08 rise. The February figure was itself revised down from 0.34. Another sign of the relief among investors following Macron\u2019s first round victory, with the volatility index falling sharply: US markets have followed the global surge in the wake of the French election first round vote. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is up more than 200 points or just over 1%, while the Nasdaq Composite opened up 1.1% at a new record high and the S&amp;P 500 rose around 1%. Here is our French election blog with all the latest developments: Market euphoria following Emmanuel Macron\u2019s victory in the first round of the French presidential election may not last, says Forex.com technical analyst Fawad Razaqzada: The euro and stock markets have absolutely surged higher on the back of news Emmanuel Macron secured almost 24% of Sunday\u2019s first-round vote, suggesting he will probably beat Marine Le Pen in a run-off for the French presidency. The threat that a Eurosceptic leader will preside over France has therefore diminished sharply. However, the prospects of an unlikely victory for Le Pen remains and that may dampen the enthusiasm expressed by investors today. What\u2019s more, there is always the possibility that the markets may have overreacted to the news. Thus, there is a risk that both the euro and European stock markets may ease back in the days to come, even if the German Dax index has climbed to a new record high level. Time for a quick recap. European stock markets are starting the week with solid gains, after centrist politician Emmanuel Macron took a big step towards becoming France\u2019s next president. The CAC 40 index of top French shares has hit a nine-year high. It is currently up 4.5%, or 227 points, at 5286, its best level since early 2008. Germany\u2019s DAX hit a record high, while the UK FTSE 100 has jumped by 1.8%, back to 7243 points. City experts are united in predicting that Macton will beat Marine Le Pen, who came second in yesterday\u2019s first round of voting, on May 7th. This is calming fears that France could vote to leave the European Union in the next few years. Valentijn van Nieuwenhuijzen, Head of Multi-Asset at NN Investment Partners, says a Macron victory has two important implications for Europe: \u201cFirst, it would substantially reduce the risk that the increasingly strong and broad-based recovery in the European economy is derailed by a political shock. Second, the prospect of stronger rather than weaker cooperation between France and Germany would emerge at the core of Europe, making the region more able to digest new political, institutional and economic challenges in the future.\u201d The euro continues to hold onto its early gains too. It\u2019s currently up 1.25% against the US dollar at $1.0858, half a cent below the five-month high struck overnight. But could investors be too complacent about the French election? Mujtaba Rahman of Eurasia Group thinks that Marine Le Pen will make a close fight of it, and argues that Macron is actually her ideal opponent. He says: While she has maintained hostility to immigration as one of the key elements of the FN\u2019s platform, Le Pen has moved its economic platform considerably further left. By promising to protect French living standards from globalization, she has broadened the party\u2019s reach and made it capable of attracting second-round votes from social conservatives and economic protectionists alike. Almost everything in Macron\u2019s background and his policy platform make it easy for the FN to caricature him as the darling of the pro-EU establishment and of financial markets. They will do this consistently and aggressively over the next two weeks in order to rally the 48% of the vote went to anti-establishment candidates. This does not include Fillon\u2019s 20%. Hartwig Kos, vice-CIO and co-head of multi-asset at SYZ Asset Management says the possibility of Marine Le Pen becoming French president appears to have subsided. That\u2019s because opinion polling has shown Macron would probably secure a larger majority over the National Front leader than, for example, the Republican candidate Francois Fillon (who came third last night). But despite that, Kos is being a little cautious -- after all , shock results are by their very nature hard to spot. As he puts it: \u201cMacron currently leads the opinion polls for the second round by almost 30% \u2013 while Le Pen scored poorly in areas such as Paris, at below 5% in the first round. This clearly improved sentiment and many investors are now more willing to bet on a positive election outcome. We have also started to reposition our portfolios into a more pro-risk stance, recognising that political risks have moved more to the tail than previously expected. Despite this, we have kept some of our hedges intact, as the main characteristic of a tail event is the fact that it is unexpected.\u201d The US stock market is expected to follow Europe\u2019s lead by rallying when trading begins at 2.30pm BST (9.30am in New York). The British pound has shed more than 1% against the euro this morning, as traders push up the single currency. This has taken the euro back to 85p against the pound, recovering its losses since Theresa May called a snap general election a week ago (which pushed the pound up). Paul Sirani, chief market analyst at Xtrade, suspects that sterling could fall further against the euro in the coming weeks. He writes: \u201cEuropean markets soared on Monday morning, with investors confident that centrist candidate Emmanuel Macron will become French President in a fortnight. \u201cMacron topped the voting in the first round, and if elected, his pro-EU agenda could continue to stabilise markets and boost the euro in the coming months. \u201cThis could spell bad news for the Brexit-hit pound; the prospect of losing further ground to the Euro may be heightened by uncertainty surrounding June\u2019s General Election, with sterling volatility far from over.\u201d Rating agency Moody\u2019s has just commented on the French presidential election: \u201cMoody\u2019s will assess any credit implications associated with the presidential election once the outcome is known. Fiscal and economic policies are likely to be key rating drivers under the next French presidency given the country\u2019s debt and growth challenges.\u201d Here\u2019s some reaction to the CBI report into British industry, from Danielle Haralambous of the Economist Intelligence Unit: Here\u2019s Howard Archer of IHS Global Insight: And here\u2019s Andy Bruce of Reuters: Britain\u2019s factory bosses have reported that 2017 got off to a good start, but there may be tougher times ahead. The CBI\u2019s latest industrial trends survey shows that export orders for manufacturing goods jumped at the fastest pace in six years, in the three months to April. Orders from outside the EU rose at their fastest ever pace. Domestic orders were also solid, jumping at the fastest rate since July 2014 during the quarter. Rain Newton-Smith, the CBI\u2019s chief Economist, says UK-manufactured goods are in demand. \u201cUK manufacturers are enjoying strong growth in demand from customers in the UK and overseas, and continue to ramp up production. \u201cExports have surged and firms are at their most optimistic about selling overseas in over four decades. Even so, the combination of the weak pound and recovering commodity prices means that cost pressures continue to build, and manufacturers report no sign of them abating over the near-term.\u201d However.....firms did also report a slowdown in export orders in April alone, after a strong March. That may be a sign that production could slow this summer...... Bloomberg have a rather neat scoreboard showing the state of the markets today. It show that Europe\u2019s stock markets are strongly higher (first column), with most currencies up against the US dollar (second column). Government bond yields have fallen (third column), which means prices have risen, while the cost of insuring said bonds has fallen (fourth column). Here\u2019s Nick Fletcher on this morning\u2019s market action: The gold price has fallen sharply this morning, down 1% to $1,270 per ounce. That\u2019s because investors are ditching safe-haven assets in favour of riskier ones: This chart shows how French shares have risen to their highest level since the financial crisis in 2008. Mihir Kapadia, CEO and Founder of Sun Global Investments, says traders are expecting a resounding win for Macron on May 7th: \u201cThe first round of the French Presidential election, as expected has led to second round contest between Macron and Le Pen. However, the fact that Macron currently leads over Le Pen does effectively remove the prospect of a victory for Marine Le Pen and her anti EU agenda. Polls see Macron beating Le Pen by a decisive 60%-40%. Salman Ahmed, chief investment strategist at Lombard Odier Investment Managers, agrees that Macron looks like a shoe-in: For the first time in six decades, both mainstream parties were eliminated in the first round, highlighting a sentiment of change that is sweeping across the political landscape of advanced economies. Could Macron \u2013 a centrist political newcomer \u2013 be to France what Trudeau is to Canada. Sunday\u2019s result is consistent with recent polls and our base case expectations. Crucially for investors, the presence of centrist candidate Macron in the second and final round significantly increases the probability of a pro-EU French president; based on the polls we assign an 80% to 85% probability of Macron winning, and the backing of Fran\u00e7ois Fillon and Beno\u00eet Hamon would further strengthen his case Newsflash! The French stock market has now hit its highest level in nine years as the election relief rally gathers pace. The CAC 40 has burst through its April 2015 high, and is now up 4.5% to levels last seen in 2008, before the world economy entered its deepest crisis in decades. Industrial stocks, and financial companies, are in hot demand thanks to optimism that France is unlikely to elect a eurosceptic president. Investors are relieved that far-left candidate Jean-Luc M\u00e9lenchon didn\u2019t join Marine Le Pen in the second-round. Trevor Greetham, Head of Multi Asset at Royal London Asset Management, explains: \u201cThe main worry for investors and traders watching the French election was that voters would be presented with a choice between anti-EU candidates on the left and right in the second round. With roughly 55% backing pro-EU candidates over the weekend and the polls clearly pointing to a Macron victory in the run off with Le Pen, the euro rallied strongly. \u201cIn stocks and bonds, markets were also taking the good news early as French bond yields dropped and stock markets rallied across the board. And in Berlin, Germany\u2019s stock market has hit a record high in the last few minutes. Emmanuel Macron faces a serious challenge to revitalise the French economy, assuming he becomes the next president. One potential hurdle is that his En Marche! party probably won\u2019t win a majority in June\u2019s legislative elections. That means Macron would have to build alliances in the French assembly to actually get things done. Analysts at ABN AMRO have warned their clients that Macon could face \u201cmajor obstacles\u201d. They say: Even presidents with the best intentions have struggled to pass reforms in France. They have been blocked by vested interests, street protests and strikes in the past. Macron could also face the obstacle of not having a parliamentary majority. Under France\u2019s semi-presidential political system, if a president\u2019s party is different to that of the majority of members in parliament, the government is divided \u2013 this is called \u201ccohabitation\u201d. Such a scenario seems likely in the event of a Le Pen, but also a Macron victory. When this happens, the President can become a marginal figure in national politics. In 1998, for example, the Socialist government of PM Lionel Jospin used its parliamentary majority to pass legislation shortening the work week from 39 to 35 hours, against the wishes of the centre-right President Chirac. In another encouraging signal, German investor confidence has hits its highest level in over five years. That\u2019s according to the monthly IFO index, which suggests Germany\u2019s economy is growing strongly right now. Anna Stupnytska, global economist at Fidelity International, says investors - and policymakers - should be remain cautious until the presidential run-off is over: \u201cMarkets will be buoyed by the positive outcome of the French election last night, with the centrist Emmanuel Macron going on to face the far right Marine Le Pen. This is not just because Macron is likely to win. Concerns over polling reliability and the turnout rate have been allayed after Sunday\u2019s strong figures and markets reacted positively to the result in Asian trading this morning, with the euro up against the US dollar and Japanese yen and French bonds performing well. \u201cHowever, Le Pen could still potentially win the second round. It is probably too early for markets to see a big relief rally just yet or indeed, for the ECB to send any signals on tapering its bond purchase programme this week. The focus now will be on whether Le Pen changes her anti-EU messages in the next few days, with the Le Pen-Macron debate scheduled for 3 May.\u201d Emmanuel Macron vs Marine Le Pen was the market\u2019s preferred outcome, says John Wyn-Evans of Investec Wealth &amp; Investment. Like most City experts, Wyn-Evans also expects Macron to win on May 7th. His policies cleverly appeal to both sides of the political spectrum, and they are succinctly described by the Financial Times as a \u201cbusiness-friendly agenda coupled with Nordic-style welfarism\u201d, encompassing, for example, labour market deregulation, lower corporation tax, and no social security contributions for those on the minimum wage. He is also a strong supporter of the European Union, although a full exposition of his EU policies might have to wait until we know who wins the German election later this year. Analysts at investment group BlackRock have warned investors not to get carried away ahead of the second round of voting, in two weekend\u2019s time. They say: Business-friendly and pro-European Macron, who has maintained a large winning margin in head-tohead polls with Le Pen, can now build on his momentum. Other candidates on both the left and right said they would vote for Macron while issuing strong statements against the National Front. We see markets pricing in some remaining political risk, given the potential for surprises in the next two weeks. Any significant shift toward Le Pen in the polls could dampen investor sentiment due to her anti-euro stance. But right now, the CAC 40 index of leading French shares is sitting proudly at a two-year high: DIY group Kingfisher is leading the rally in London, up 5.2%. It\u2019s closely exposed to the French economy, through its Castorama chain. The Macron relief rally is also driving shares up in London. The FTSE 100 has jumped by 130 points, or 1.75%, in early trading to 7238 points. Financial stocks are (unsurprisingly) driving the rally, with Barclays up 4%, Royal Bank of Scotland gaining 3%. Bank shares are jumping across Europe this morning: Other European stock markets are also up strongly, with Germany\u2019s DAX gaining 2%. Shares are rallying across Europe at the start of trading, as traders react to last night\u2019s French election. In Paris the CAC 40 has jumped by 4% to its highest level since April 2015. Bank shares are leading the rally, with Societe Generale, Credit Agricole and BNP Paribas up by around 10% each. Mike van Dulken of Accendo Markets says traders are cheering the news that Macron and Le Pen have progressed to the second round run-off of the French presidential election, adding: The assumption is that centrist Macron is victorious in a fortnight\u2019s time, picking up supporters of Fillon, Hamon and M\u00e9lenchon. This chart explains why investors are so confident that Macron will become the next French president in two weeks: Here\u2019s Jon Henley\u2019s head-to-head guide to the two candidates who will contest the run-off in a fortnight: France\u2019s government bonds are rallying hard in early trading, in another sign of relief about last night\u2019s election results. This means the gap between French and German borrowing costs has narrowed sharply, showing that investors are more confident about lending to Paris. That\u2019s because the threat of France leaving the euro has now waned, given Macron\u2019s pro-European credentials. France\u2019s stock market is tipped to rocket this morning, quite possibly by more than 4%. That\u2019s because the \u2018nightmare scenario\u2019 of Marine Le Pen becoming French president appears to have been squashed, says Neil Wilson of ETX Capital: With pollsters and analysts giving the FN candidate virtually no chance in the second round against Macron, those really big worries that many had coming into this election - the risk of \u2018Frexit\u2019 and a breakup of the Eurozone - have definitely subsided. But they have not vanished. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. A wave of relief is sweeping through the markets this morning, pushing the euro up and triggering a wave of buying. The first round of the French election delivered the result that most investors were hoping for, calming fears that the eurozone faced another threat to its existence. In a massive snub to the established parties, the presidency will be contested between centrist Emmanuel Macron and National Front leader Marine Le Pen. And there\u2019s a widespread expectation that Macron is ready to march into the \u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace. The euro spiked to a five-month high over $1.09 when the polls closed last night, and forecasters correctly predicted that Macron had won first place. Most of the defeated candidates have already thrown their support behind Macron, and he is heavily odd-on to become the next French president. If you missed last night\u2019s excitement, let our Paris correspondent Angelique Chrisafis explain: The independent centrist Emmanuel Macron has topped the first round of the French presidential election and according to projections will face the far-right Front National\u2019s Marine Le Pen in a standoff marked by anti-establishment angerthat knocked France\u2019s traditional political parties out of the race. Macron topped Sunday\u2019s first round with 23.9% of votes, slightly ahead of Le Pen with 21.4%, according to near-final results from the interior ministry. Macron, 39, a political novice, now becomes the favourite to be elected as France\u2019s next president. He is the youngest ever French presidential hopeful and has never run for election before. After the UK\u2019s vote to leave the European Union and the US vote for the political novice Donald Trump as president, the French presidential race is the latest election to shake up establishment politics by kicking out the figures that stood for the status quo. The French election is the main discussion point in the markets today, but there are a couple of other things on the agenda. 9am: German IFO business confidence report for April 11am: The CBI\u2019s survey of UK industrial trends in April",

Helena Smith writes:</p> <blockquote> <p>The congratulatory message from Tsipras not only underscored the strong alliance between Greece and France, but also how much store Athens sets on Paris\u2019 long-standing support in economic matters. Throughout the seven-year debt crisis, Greece has frequently depended on France\u2019s backing in often fraught negotiations with creditors, not least Berlin.</p> <p>After weeks of tense talks over the country\u2019s latest bailout review, monitors representing lender institutions will return to Athens to resume inspections tomorrow, European Commission spokesman Margaritis Schinas announced today. The aim was to reach an agreement \u201cas soon as possible,\u201d he said, in comments reflecting Europe\u2019s desire to avert another Greek crisis in the run-up to Germany also going to the polls. The inspection tour, which is expected to be wrapped up within weeks, will focus on the \u201ctechnical details\u201d of implementing \u20ac3.6bn worth of further pension cuts and tax hikes, the latter enforced though broad expansion of the tax base.</p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p>Highlighting the extraordinary fiscal adjustment Greece has made, Schinas said the EU statistics agency, Eurostat, had confirmed that in 2016 the country\u2019s primary budget surplus far exceeded expectations coming in at 3.9% of GDP (excluding debt servicing costs). The spokesman said the Commission was confident Greece could meet its budget targets in 2017 and 2018.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"51677aed92571085855e416e7c9516b078d21538\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/51677aed92571085855e416e7c9516b078d21538/0_244_7235_4341/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Greek newspapers report the French poll news\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Greek newspapers report the French poll news</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Eleftherios Elis/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-58fe0f6fe4b09033f808c8fc\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-04-24T14:50:16.048Z\">3.50pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>A couple of manufacturing surveys from the US are showing a slight dip in performance.</p> <p>The Dallas Fed manufacturing activity index dipped from 16.9 in March to 16.8 this month, below expectations of a rise to 17.</p> <p>Meanwhile the Chicago Fed national activity index for March fell from a 0.27 increase in February to a 0.08 rise.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Share prices for two of Britain\u2019s biggest energy companies have fallen in the wake of the Conservative party\u2019s pledge to cap energy bills. Shares in British Gas owner Centrica, the UK\u2019s largest energy supplier, fell 4.2%, while SSE shares fell 3.2%. The pair\u2019s share prices had dipped by similar amounts after Ed Miliband promised an energy price freeze in 2013. Ministers said on Sunday that the cap on standard variable tariffs, which more than two-thirds of households pay, would save the average family around \u00a3100 a year. SSE has more customers on standard tariffs than any of the big six energy companies, with 91% or 3.8 million, making it the most exposed to the Tory plan. British Gas is the only one of the large suppliers to have not hiked prices in the recent flurry of tariff rises, although analysts expect the cap will dent its parent company\u2019s earnings before by \u00a3300m. Experts at Jefferies, the stockbroker, said that if the company offset the pain by making its fixed deals more expensive \u2013 as seems likely across the industry \u2013 it would reduce the loss to \u00a3150m. Several analysts said a price cap could hit the ability of Centrica to pay a dividend to shareholders. The bank Berenberg calculated that a \u00a3100 annual cut for the 17m households on standard variable tariffs would cost energy suppliers at least \u00a31.7bn a year, with the big six bearing the brunt of the losses. Iain Conn, Centrica\u2019s chief executive, reacted to the the Tory campaign pledge by arguing it would hinder rather than help consumers. \u201cPrice regulation will result in reduced competition and choice, stifle innovation and potentially impact customer service,\u201d he said. ScottishPower criticised the policy and called for standard variable tariffs to be abolished and replaced with something more akin to an insurance product, fixed for a certain period of time after which it would need to be renewed. The company said a cap would stop competition. A spokesman for SSE said: \u201cwhile we will work with an open mind with government on any reforms, we would always caution about the potential unintended consequences of any intervention in what is a rapidly changing and increasingly competitive market.\u201d The Tory policy goes against the advice of the Competition and Markets Authority, which concluded in a review last year that a cap would \u201crun excessive risks of undermining the competitive process, likely resulting in worse outcomes for customers in the long run\u201d. But the founder of one of the market\u2019s smaller suppliers said the big players had only themselves to blame, by overcharging loyal customers. \u201cWe hear the big six bleating that they barely make a profit. That\u2019s not because their prices are competitive, it\u2019s because they\u2019re bloated and inefficient \u2013 and their customers pay the price,\u201d said Greg Jackson of Octopus Energy. Miliband joked on Sunday that the interventionist stance taken by the Conservatives would prompt criticism from newspapers that had attacked his pledge four years ago. \u2022This article was amended on 25 April 2017 to include the correct name for the competition watchdog, the Competition and Markets Authority.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Britain\u2019s largest architectural firm, Foster + Partners, plans to lay off nearly 100 people, and blamed the uncertainty around construction projects caused by last summer\u2019s Brexit vote. The company, whose London projects have included the Millennium Bridge, the Great Hall redevelopment at the British Museum and the Gherkin tower, said the cuts would mainly affect staff at its headquarters in Battersea, south-west London. It said \u201ca cross-section of the team\u201d would be affected, from administrators to architects. The move was first reported by Construction News and its sister title the Architects\u2019 Journal. The firm, founded by Foster and his wife in 1967, said: \u201cFoster + Partners has grown significantly over the last two years with a record number of projects, many of which are now close to completion. \u2018This, coupled with some uncertainty in the construction market, has led us to make some adjustments to our practice, which regrettably includes some redundancies enabling us to balance numbers with our current and foreseeable workload.\u201d The latest accounts show that the company employed more than 1,250 people in London in the year to 30 April 2016, out of a global workforce of nearly 1,500, from New York to Shanghai. The company\u2019s last big round of redundancies was in 2009 at the height of the financial crisis, when it cut about 300 jobs globally and closed offices in Berlin and Istanbul. While the firm\u2019s turnover rose from \u00a3188m in 2015 to \u00a3225m in 2016, its full-year pre-tax profits dropped from \u00a351.1m to \u00a333.4m. Most of its revenues are generated overseas. Costs, including its wage bill, increased as it hired about 150 more people compared with 2015. However, the directors\u2019 combined pay, including pension payments, was slashed to \u00a35.9m from \u00a314.1m, partly because their number was reduced to 10 from 13. The highest-paid director, thought to be Foster, took a big pay cut \u2013 from \u00a31.9m to \u00a3758,000. Foster + Partners is known for the restoration of the Reichstag in Germany, which includes a glass dome from where visitors can peer into the parliamentary chamber, and has been shortlisted for the revamp of the Palace of Westminster. The company recently designed Bloomberg\u2019s vast new European headquarters in the City of London, which is bigger than the nearby Bank of England.

      "bodyText": "Stock markets surged and the euro jumped sharply after centrist candidate Emmanuel Macron won the first round of the weekend\u2019s French presidential election, easing fears of a victory by the far-right Front National. France\u2019s Cac index climbed more than 4% to a nine-year high, its best daily performance since August 2015, as investors bet that Macron would defeat the other runoff candidate, the FN\u2019s Marine Le Pen on 7 May. The first vote put Macron on 23.75% with Le Pen on 21.53%. The result was seen as the most market-friendly outcome, putting the independent former investment banker in pole position to fend off the anti-EU Le Pen. The euphoric mood spilled over into other stock markets, with Germany\u2019s Dax up 3.3% to a new closing peak and the FTSE 100 recovering 2.1% to 7,264 after last week\u2019s slump in the wake of the UK general election announcement. . The FTSE 250 added more than 1% to hit a record closing high, while in Asia the Nikkei 225 ended up nearly 1.4%. On Wall Street, US markets also rallied, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average up by about 200 points or nearly 1% by lunchtime and the Nasdaq Composite technology index hitting its best ever level. Banking shares were among the leading gainers across the globe, lifted by the prospect of a more certain economic outlook for the eurozone if the EU-friendly Macron wins the final round of the election. The VIX volatility index \u2013 the so-called fear index \u2013 fell by 22%, its biggest daily drop since the day after Donald Trump\u2019s US election victory last November. Meanwhile, the single currency hit a five-and-a-half month high against the dollar. Although it came off its best levels, it was still up about 1% against the dollar and the pound as European markets closed. Sterling had its worst day against the euro since last October and analysts cautioned the currency was likely to remain volatile before the latest European Central Bank meeting on Thursday. French government 10-year bond prices rose to three-month highs as concerns about the election eased. Michael Hewson at CMC Markets said: \u201cFor markets, this was always the least bad option, with most expecting Mr Macron to become president in two weeks\u2019 time as the other candidates endorse him over Marine Le Pen. \u201cBut for all his market and EU-friendly rhetoric, Emmanuel Macron will face the same problems previous French presidents have faced, which means he will have to reach out across the political divide. This lack of support is likely to make him a lame duck president, only able to affect minor tweaks or changes.\u201d Trevor Greetham, the head of multi asset at Royal London Asset Management, said: \u201cIt\u2019s worth noting that the French election is likely to be the first of several risks to test markets as thin summer trading comes into view. \u201cSigns of a temporary peaking out in global growth, the impact of tightening moves in China and, first up, a potential government shutdown in the US at the end of this week, mean investors can\u2019t pop the champagne corks just yet.\u201d",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Disney, the Gap and Pepsi are being pressured to quit the US Chamber of Commerce, America\u2019s largest lobby group, amid criticism of its big-money efforts to fight climate change legislation and promote tobacco products. A coalition of pressure groups including Action on Smoking and Health, Greenpeace, Public Citizen and the Sierra Club have written to the CEOs of the three companies asking them to stop funding the powerful business group. In a letter to Disney\u2019s boss, Bob Iger, the coalition points to the media company\u2019s commitment to reduce its net greenhouse gas emissions by 50% by 2020, its support of the Paris climate agreement and its ban on depictions of smoking in theme parks and all G, PG and PG-13 movies. \u201cUnfortunately, the US Chamber of Commerce is doing everything it can to block efforts to combat both climate change and anti-smoking laws and regulations. It opposes the Paris Agreement that you publicly support, is suing to block the implementation of the Clean Power Plan, consistently lobbies against legislation aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions, and spends millions of dollars in money on elections ads urging voters to back candidates who support the fossil fuel industry and oppose efforts to combat climate change,\u201d they write. The US Chamber of Commerce is the world\u2019s largest business organization and represents more than 3m businesses, large and small. Under its president and CEO, Thomas Donohue, who took over the chamber in 1997, it has become a political powerhouse with global influence, although it is secretive about its membership. Last year alone it spent $104m on lobbying, the most of any lobby group. It has used its influence to fight anti-tobacco legislation across the world. The chamber campaigned against US sanctions on Russia after its incursions into Ukraine and Donohue met Egypt\u2019s authoritarian president, Abdel Fatah al-Sisi, after his recent White House visit. The activists\u2019 campaign comes as some of the world\u2019s largest companies have quietly severed ties with the chamber. According to an analysis by Public Citizen, at least 13 of the world\u2019s biggest companies (Costco, eBay, Hewlett-Packard, General Mills, Kellogg, Kraft Heinz, Mars, Mattel, Mondel\u0113z, Nestl\u00e9, Starbucks, Unilever and Walgreens Boots Alliance*) have quit the US Chamber of Commerce in recent years amid political disagreements and worries about its stance on the environment. A number of those companies confirmed to the Guardian that they were no longer members but would not speak on the record about their reasons for leaving. Other companies did not return emails and calls for comment. A spokesman for the chamber disputed the companies that had left and their reasons for leaving but she declined to confirm which companies had stayed. \u201cThe chamber has never disclosed and does not disclose its membership and therefore I will not be able to confirm or deny who is or isn\u2019t a member. However, I can tell you that your list is simply wrong, and it would be inaccurate for you to report that those companies have left the chamber for the reasons you mentioned in your inquiry,\u201d Blair Latoff Holmes, vice-president of media and external communications, said. The chamber claims to be a bipartisan organisation but has become increasingly partisan. For the first time last year, 100% of its election spending backed Republican candidates. Holmes said: \u201cOur endorsements are made by a lawmaker\u2019s scorecard, and their views on the issues that are important to our membership and the American business community, based on economic growth and job creation. In recent years, Republicans have scored higher than Democrats on issues of importance to the business community but we have maintained a bipartisan approach to the candidates we support and have bestowed awards such as the \u2018Spirit of Enterprise\u2019 award to Republicans and Democrats alike.\u201d The pressure group\u2019s lobbying has already led to a number of high-profile, and public, departures. In 2015, the pharmacy giant CVS quit, citing the lobby group\u2019s pro-tobacco work. CVS, the first major drugstore to remove tobacco products from its shelves, said it had been \u201csurprised\u201d by a New York Times report that the chamber lobbied foreign governments to ease restrictions on tobacco sales. In 2009, the chamber called for the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to hold \u201cthe Scopes monkey trial of the 21st century\u201d \u2013 a trial that put creationist theory up against evolutionary science \u2013 in order to discuss humanity\u2019s role in climate change. That same year, Apple and the utility companies Pacific Gas &amp; Electric (PG&amp;E) and Excelon left the chamber, citing its anti-environmental advocacy. \u201cWe find it dismaying that the chamber neglects the indisputable fact that a decisive majority of experts have said the data on global warming are compelling and point to a threat that cannot be ignored,\u201d the PG&amp;E chairman and chief executive, Peter Darbee, told the chamber. Nike too has voiced criticism of the lobby group\u2019s climate stance, saying it \u201cfundamentally disagrees with the US Chamber of Commerce\u2019s position on climate change\u201d. Dan Dudis, director of chamber watch at Public Citizen, said activists would target other chamber members in the coming months. \u201cWe are looking at companies that have explicit public policy positions that run counter to the chamber\u2019s stance.\u201d He said the chamber was \u201cpushing the interests of a minority\u201d by claiming to represent a broad swath of businesses. \u201cThose businesses might give $500,000 or $1m for trade lobbying but money is fungible,\u201d he said. \u201cThat cash frees up money for the chamber to lobby against climate change legislation, for tobacco and against the interests of many of its members. *Walgreens Boots Alliance has informed the Guardian that it had not been a member of the Chamber for almost a decade.",

A spokesman for the chamber disputed the companies that had left and their reasons for leaving but she declined to confirm which companies had stayed.</p> <p>\u201cThe chamber has never disclosed and does not disclose its membership and therefore I will not be able to confirm or deny who is or isn\u2019t a member. However, I can tell you that your list is simply wrong, and it would be inaccurate for you to report that those companies have left the chamber for the reasons you mentioned in your inquiry,\u201d Blair Latoff Holmes, vice-president of media and external communications, said.</p> <p>The chamber claims to be a bipartisan organisation but has become increasingly partisan. For the first time last year, 100% of its election spending backed Republican candidates. Holmes said: \u201cOur endorsements are made by a lawmaker\u2019s scorecard, and their views on the issues that are important to our membership and the American business community, based on economic growth and job creation. In recent years, Republicans have scored higher than Democrats on issues of importance to the business community but we have maintained a bipartisan approach to the candidates we support and have bestowed awards such as the \u2018Spirit of Enterprise\u2019 award to Republicans and Democrats alike.\u201d<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>The pressure group\u2019s lobbying has already led to a number of high-profile, and public, departures. In 2015, the pharmacy giant CVS quit, citing the lobby group\u2019s pro-tobacco work. CVS, the first major drugstore to remove tobacco products from its shelves, said it had been \u201csurprised\u201d by a <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/01/business/international/us-chamber-works-globally-to-fight-antismoking-measures.html?_r=2\">New York Times report</a> that the chamber lobbied foreign governments to ease restrictions on tobacco sales.</p> <p>In 2009, the chamber called for the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to hold \u201c<a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://articles.latimes.com/2009/aug/25/nation/na-climate-trial25\">the Scopes monkey trial of the 21st century</a>\u201d \u2013 a trial that put creationist theory up against evolutionary science \u2013 in order to discuss humanity\u2019s role in climate change. That same year, <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/10/05/AR2009100502744.html\">Apple</a> and the utility companies Pacific Gas &amp; Electric (PG&amp;E) and Excelon left the chamber, citing its anti-environmental advocacy. </p> <p>\u201cWe find it dismaying that the chamber neglects the indisputable fact that a decisive majority of experts have said the data on global warming are compelling and point to a threat that cannot be ignored,\u201d the PG&amp;E<em tabindex=\"-1\"> </em>chairman and chief executive, Peter Darbee, told the chamber.</p> <p>Nike too has voiced criticism of the lobby group\u2019s climate stance, saying it \u201cfundamentally disagrees with the US Chamber of Commerce\u2019s position on climate change\u201d.</p> <p>Dan Dudis, director of chamber watch at Public Citizen, said activists would target other chamber members in the coming months. \u201cWe are looking at companies that have explicit public policy positions that run counter to the chamber\u2019s stance.\u201d </p> <p>He said the chamber was \u201cpushing the interests of a minority\u201d by claiming to represent a broad swath of businesses. \u201cThose businesses might give $500,000 or $1m for trade lobbying but money is fungible,\u201d he said. \u201cThat cash frees up money for the chamber to lobby against climate change legislation, for tobacco and against the interests of many of its members.</p> <p><em>*Walgreens Boots Alliance has informed the Guardian that it had not been a member of the Chamber for almost a decade.</em></p>",

      "bodyText": "The luxury shoe and bag retailer Jimmy Choo has put itself up for sale in a move that took the market by surprise. The retailer said it had \u201cdecided to conduct a review of the various strategic options open to the company to maximise value for its shareholders\u201d and that it was seeking offers for the business. The move was backed by the company\u2019s independent directors and JAB Luxury, its majority shareholder with a stake of 68%. Shares in Jimmy Choo jumped 10% to a record high of 186.25p on the news, valuing the group at more than \u00a3720m. The company floated on the stock market in 2014 at a price of 140p a share, valuing it at about \u00a3550m. Any sale is expected to attract interest from strategic American buyers as well as Middle Eastern, Chinese and Russian bidders. The company was founded in London in 1996 by the Malaysian fashion designer Jimmy Choo and the then Vogue accessories editor Tamara Mellon. It runs 150 stores around the world, opening 10 last year as well as refitting 16 shops. It recently reported operating profits of \u00a342.5m for 2016, up nearly 43%, after success with luxury trainers. Men\u2019s shoes remain its fastest-growing category and account for 9% of revenue. The company has benefited from the drop in sterling since the EU referendum and is expanding in China. It has fared better than other luxury retailers such as Burberry, which were hit by Chinese tourists cutting back on luxury purchases. JAB, an investment company owned by Germany\u2019s billionaire Reimann family, wants to sell its stake in the shoes group to focus on food and other consumer goods. The family, one of Europe\u2019s wealthiest business dynasties, has been building an empire of coffee brands and last year added Krispy Kreme Doughnuts to its portfolio. It also owns the US cosmetics brand Coty. Luxury investments make up less than 10% of JAB\u2019s portfolio, and it plans to use the sale proceeds to take on the likes of Nestl\u00e9. A Euromonitor analyst said: \u201cGlobally, retail sales of men\u2019s designer footwear have grown marginally faster than women\u2019s designer footwear over the last three years. So it is easy to see why Jimmy Choo has expanded into this male segment. Women\u2019s luxury footwear still generates almost twice the retail value of men\u2019s luxury footwear, though, and that disparity is unlikely to narrow significantly over the next decade. \u201cBut Jimmy Choo needs to be careful not to get ahead of itself. Remember what happened to Mulberry, another niche British luxury brand, when it drifted too far from its comfort zone? One year sales were soaring, the next they were dropping amidst a spate of profit warnings.\u201d",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Britain\u2019s economy cooled considerably in the first three months of the year as higher inflation put a squeeze on disposable incomes, official figures are expected to show this week. The economy shrugged off the shock of the Brexit vote last June and has been surprisingly resilient, with growth rates of 0.5% in the third quarter of 2016 and 0.7% in the final quarter. But in a turn of fortunes, City economists are forecasting a tough year ahead, with a sharp slowdown in growth to 0.4% between January and March. This would be the weakest performance since the first quarter of 2016, when the economy grew by 0.2%. The Office for National Statistics is due to publish its initial estimate for first quarter GDP on Friday. Brexit and the health of the economy will form a central part of the general election campaign waged in the run-up to the snap poll on 8 June. The work and pensions minister, Damian Green, said on Sunday that the Conservative party\u2019s election manifesto would focus on the Brexit negotiations and domestic concerns such as strengthening the economy. The negative effects of sterling\u2019s slide since the EU referendum appear to be outweighing the positive effects \u2013 a boost to exports. The weaker pound has raised the cost of imported materials and pushed inflation to a three-year high of 2.3%. This meant that real wages \u2013 adjusted for inflation \u2013 fell in February for the first time in two and a half years, even though unemployment continues to drop and vacancies are at record levels. Howard Archer, the chief European and UK economist at consultancy IHS Markit, said: \u201cFollowing the likely marked first quarter slowdown, we suspect that 2017 will become even more challenging for the UK economy \u2013 and particularly for consumers as their purchasing power is squeezed harder still.\u201d He expects GDP growth to be limited to 1.6% this year, with inflation rising to 3% by the end of the year. Economists do not expect the general election to change the economic outlook for this year \u2013 assuming the Conservatives are re-elected with an increased majority. Consumer spending has been strong and the main driver of UK economic growth, but economic surveys and the latest retail sales figures suggest spending started cooling markedly at the beginning of this year as shoppers felt the pinch from rising prices. Retail sales, which account for about a third of household spending, dropped 1.4% between January and March, the biggest quarterly fall in seven years. Confidence among consumers weakened in the first quarter, according to the latest Deloitte consumer tracker, which polled 3,000 people in mid-March. It dipped to -7% from -6% in the fourth quarter. Four of the six measures that make up the confidence index recorded negative movements, with inflation rising and discretionary spending falling. People\u2019s confidence in their own disposable income remaining at current levels fell by three percentage points to -17% in the quarter, its lowest level in more than two years. Spending on essential items remained strong at 12%, but spending on discretionary items returned to negative territory, falling by four percentage points to -4%. Ben Perkins, the head of consumer research at Deloitte, said: \u201cWith less disposable income, consumers will have to consider whether to trade down, buy less or borrow more. Consumers are already showing signs of moving away from making major purchases and this is a trend that is likely to continue.\u201d Chris Hare, UK economist at Investec, said: \u201cWhile the weaker pound is probably beginning to provide some boost to net exports, the negative impact on household spending power via higher imported inflation is beginning to bite discernibly. Indeed, the inflation squeeze is material: as an average over the quarter, CPI inflation climbed to 2.1% year-on-year in the first quarter versus 1.2% in the fourth quarter.\u201d Other countries will also release preliminary estimates for GDP at the start of the year on Friday. The US, the world\u2019s largest economy, is likely to have slowed sharply to an annualised growth rate of about 1% in the first quarter. France is forecast to have grown at a 0.4% quarterly rate, similar to the UK, while Spain is expected to have maintained stronger growth, of 0.6%. The International Monetary Fund last week revised up its UK growth forecast to 2% for 2017, which would make it the second fastest-growing advanced economy after the US. The Washington-based institution said it would take longer than expected for the negative effects of the Brexit vote to materialise. It expects growth to slow to 1.5% next year, a touch slower than previously forecast.",

France is forecast to have grown at a 0.4% quarterly rate, similar to the UK, while Spain is expected to have maintained stronger growth, of 0.6%.</p> <p>The International Monetary Fund last week <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/apr/18/imf-ratchets-up-uk-economic-growth-forecast-to-2\">revised up its UK growth forecast to 2% for 2017</a>, which would make it the second fastest-growing advanced economy after the US. The Washington-based institution said it would take longer than expected for the negative effects of the Brexit vote to materialise. It expects growth to slow to 1.5% next year, a touch slower than previously forecast.</p>",
