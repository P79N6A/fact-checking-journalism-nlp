      "bodyText": "Shares in TSB surged by more than 23% after the bank revealed it had received a takeover approach from Spain\u2019s Banco de Sabadell. The Spanish bank\u2019s offer values TSB at around \u00a31.7bn, 30% above the price at which it floated on the stock exchange last summer. TSB is still 50% owned by the bailed-out Lloyds Banking Group. TSB shares was up 62p to 326p on Thursday, slightly below the indicative 340p bid price but well ahead of the 260p they were listed at last year. Lloyds said TSB\u2019s assets are valued at 327p a share. In a statement to the London Stock Exchange, TSB said its board believes that Sabadell could accelerate TSB\u2019s retail growth strategy and its expansion into the small business lending market. It added that Sabadell would continue to operate TSB as a \u201crobust competitor\u201d in the UK banking market, building on the British bank\u2019s brand name. Half of TSB was spun out of Lloyds last June, and the new bank views itself as a challenger to the four biggest players: Lloyds, Royal Bank of Scotland, Barclays and HSBC. Lloyds is required to sell its remaining shares by the end of this year, and indicated it was considering accepting the offer. It said: \u201c[Lloyds] would be minded to accept an offer at this price if it is made, subject to reaching a satisfactory conclusion on the terms.\u201d Lloyds was ordered to sell off the TSB branches, code-named Verde, under the terms of a deal thrashed out with the EU at the time of the \u00a320bn taxpayer bailout. Originally it had planned to sell the business to the Co-operative Banking Group, but after talks collapsed Lloyds took the alternative route of a stock market flotation. The proposed price for TSB suggests that advisers significantly undervalued the bank at its flotation last year. But Lloyds argued that the potential deal would see it receive about \u00a31.5bn for TSB \u2013 after raising \u00a3630m via the flotation and \u00a3850m from the sale of its remaining stake \u2013 more than double what it would have got if the Co-op bid had gone ahead. Lloyds set the flotation price after advice from a string of investment banks, including Citigroup, JP Morgan Cazenove and UBS. Ian Gordon, a banking analyst at Investec, said the proposal was unexpected but made sense. He said: \u201cGiven that Sabadell acquired Lloyds\u2019 Spanish business in 2013, there is clearly an existing relationship which may have helped discussions to develop. We think the proposal looks sensible. However, we equally assume Lloyds attempted to flush out all other credible interest before embarking on its plan B of an IPO just 10 months ago, so a counter-bid now feels unlikely.\u201d A takeover of TSB will not cut all of its ties with Lloyds, as it still rents the use of its IT systems from its parent. TSB could continue to pay for the use of those IT platform after a Sabadell takeover, or it could claim a \u00a3450m IT dowry from Lloyds that has been earmarked for the purpose of moving TSB on to an independent system. A Lloyds spokesman said: \u201cWe wouldn\u2019t just hand over \u00a3450m; rather, we would pay for the costs of TSB moving off our IT platform as they occurred.\u201d Last month, Lloyds announced that group profits had doubled to \u00a3170m in the year to 31 December, with its chief executive, Paul Pester, making clear that it is considering its own takeover deals. There has been speculation that TSB was eyeing the specialist lender Aldermore, which has also just floated. TSB gained half a million new banking customers in 2014 as it stepped up its challenge to Britain\u2019s big four lenders, winning one in 12 of all new and switching bank accounts. Shares in Banco de Sabadell, which is valued at around \u20ac10bn (\u00a37bn), lost 6.6% on the news of its move for TSB to close at \u20ac2.32. Buying the UK bank would give Sabadell its first European business outside Spain.",

The fear is that consumers will delay purchases and businesses will cancel pay rises and investments in new equipment. </p> <p>Carney faces critics from both ends of the economic spectrum. Some have argued that the economy is sufficiently strong now to withstand higher rates, while others believe recent GDP growth disguises a long-term weakness that means the economy needs the support of low rates for several more years.</p> <p>David Blanchflower, a former MPC member and economics professor at the Ivy League Dartmouth college in the US, said there was little evidence of wage increases in the UK being sufficient to put pressure on prices.<br></p> <p>He joins many critics who argue that with inflation at -0.1% in the US and zero in the eurozone, inflationary pressures, including higher wages, are absent across the developed world.</p> <p>Carney said: \u201cA debt-deflation dynamic was at the core of the Great Depression and in the Japanese malaise following the collapse of the asset bubbles of the 1980s. It would be a particular concern if the pace of wage growth were to follow prices down. There is no evidence of that in the UK, where wage growth has picked up over the past six months.</p> <p>\u201cAnd more broadly, following the 2008 financial crisis debt deflation has been the dog that hasn\u2019t barked,\u201d he went on. \u201cBut we shouldn\u2019t rest too easy \u2013 there are several reasons why the dog might have just been sleeping, and central banks need to be vigilant against the risk that recent low inflation stirs it from its slumber\u201d.</p>",

But he said the UK\u2019s recovery and higher wages would act as a counterbalance to global forces and push inflation back up to its target again. \u201cThe Bank expects to return inflation to target within two years and to make limited and gradual increases in Bank Rate over the next three years in order to achieve that in a sustainable manner,\u201d he said. The governor\u2019s speech is one of several by Bank policymakers in recent weeks seeking to reassure households and businesses that the Bank is capable of engineering a return to more normal inflation and interest rates. While Europe and Japan are expected to continue suffering from low inflation and rock-bottom interest rates into the next decade, the Bank believes the UK is more closely attuned to the US, where the Federal Reserve is widely expected to start raising interest rates this summer in response to the country\u2019s strong recovery. The MPC wants to prevent consumers and businesses from adjusting their purchasing and investment plans because they believe inflation and interest rates will remain low for many more years. The fear is that consumers will delay purchases and businesses will cancel pay rises and investments in new equipment. Carney faces critics from both ends of the economic spectrum. Some have argued that the economy is sufficiently strong now to withstand higher rates, while others believe recent GDP growth disguises a long-term weakness that means the economy needs the support of low rates for several more years. David Blanchflower, a former MPC member and economics professor at the Ivy League Dartmouth college in the US, said there was little evidence of wage increases in the UK being sufficient to put pressure on prices. He joins many critics who argue that with inflation at -0.1% in the US and zero in the eurozone, inflationary pressures, including higher wages, are absent across the developed world. Carney said: \u201cA debt-deflation dynamic was at the core of the Great Depression and in the Japanese malaise following the collapse of the asset bubbles of the 1980s. It would be a particular concern if the pace of wage growth were to follow prices down. There is no evidence of that in the UK, where wage growth has picked up over the past six months. \u201cAnd more broadly, following the 2008 financial crisis debt deflation has been the dog that hasn\u2019t barked,\u201d he went on. \u201cBut we shouldn\u2019t rest too easy \u2013 there are several reasons why the dog might have just been sleeping, and central banks need to be vigilant against the risk that recent low inflation stirs it from its slumber\u201d.",

      "bodyText": "Just one more thing... The Guardian\u2019s Philip Oltermann brings us this update on the Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble/Yanis Varoufakis insult-gate. Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble speaks with a strong Swabian dialect and does seem to enjoy veering off script at press briefings. Only last May, the German finance minister caused some raised eyebrows at a speech in Berlin, when he called France\u2019s Front National a \u201cfascist and extremist party\u201d. But the latest diplomatic row between Germany and Greece seems to stem from a mistranslation. Here is what Sch\u00e4uble says in the clip, in which he describes a meeting with his Greek counterpart Varoufakis: \u201cAfterwards we had a long, intense bilateral exchange, and I said to him: \u2018I wouldn\u2019t want to swap jobs with you\u2019. My job isn\u2019t always fun either, but compared to his \u2026 \u00e0 la bonne heure! And he does have a different way of communicating \u2026 Normally one shouldn\u2019t give details from internal chats, but in this case I think I can report an anecdote \u2013 so he said to me that everything was always misunderstood, the media were terrible. And then I said: \u201cWell, to us you first came across as someone who made a stronger impression in terms of communication than in terms of substance. But that may have been a false impression\u2019. [To audience] Stop the silly giggling! But that he is suddenly na\u00efve when it comes to communication, that would come as news to me. But you never stop learning.\u201d Have a good evening. AM Before closing up for the day, here is a summary of the main events. Greek PM Alexis Tsipras travelled to Paris to discuss Greek reform proposals with the OECD. A co-operation deal was signed, with the OECD agreeing to advise Greece on how best to implement reforms Speaking at a press conference, Tsipras said Greece would decide on the best way forward for Greece, but it needed the support of its international partners The ECB extended Greece\u2019s emergency liquidity lifeline German finance minister Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble insisted it was \u201cnonsense\u201d that he had insulted Yanis Varoufakis, after Athens lodged an official complaint Eurozone industrial production fell 0.1% in January, disappointing expectations of a 0.3% increase TSB revealed it is in takeover talks with Spanish lender Banco de Sabadell The euro rose against the dollar, and is now up 0.7% at $1.0617 (helped by weaker-than-expected US retail sales data) The UK\u2019s trade deficit narrowed in January Thank you for reading the blog today, and for commenting. Please join us again tomorrow. AM There is confusion over exactly what Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble said about Yanis Varoufakis at a press conference following Monday\u2019s eurogroup meeting. Here is Reuters\u2019 take on the matter: Athens has accused German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble of insulting his Greek counterpart, further eroding a diplomatic relationship already badly strained by Berlin\u2019s tough stance on Greece\u2019s debt woes. Schaeuble, who has become a lightning rod for Greek frustrations about Germany, dismissed the complaint as \u201cnonsense\u201d. Greece said it was angered by Schaeuble\u2019s tone at a news conference earlier this week after an EU meeting in Brussels where Greek Finance Minister Yanis Varoufakis had pushed efforts to renegotiate his country\u2019s huge bailout programme. \u201cIt was not about a particular quote from Schaeuble, but his condescending, pejorative manner in general,\u201d a Greek diplomat in Berlin told Reuters, declining to be named. Speaking in Athens, Greek Foreign Ministry spokesman Constantinos Koutras said an official complaint was made on Tuesday. \u201cAs a minister of a country that is our friend and our ally, he (Schaeuble) cannot personally insult a colleague,\u201d he said. Greek media had quoted Schaeuble as calling Varoufakis \u201cfoolishly naive\u201d in his communications. Foreign media did not report the same quote, and Koutras agreed that the minister had been mistranslated, but said his general tone was offensive. Schaeuble dismissed the notion. \u201cNo, I haven\u2019t insulted my Greek counterpart, that is nonsense,\u201d he told Reuters in Berlin. The latest spat follows days of tensions between the two countries, with Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras reviving the barbed issue of World War Two reparations and his defence minister threatening to let illegal immigrants head to Germany. Tsipras says he is optimistic about Greece\u2019s future. I don\u2019t feel as if I have a noose around my neck. I feel Greece has the will to move forward. Out partners need to understand they need to help and assist us, and leave the past as a bad memory. Tsipras acknowledges that there is \u201cmutual suspicion\u201d between Greece and its eurozone partners, some of whom do not believe Greece is serious about wanting to reform. We need to construc t trust and confidence bridges. He added he was hoping the agreement with the OECD struck today would give its partners more confidence in Greece. [I am hoping] that signature will be a passport to more confidence. I am optimistic. The OECD\u2019s Gurria says it is up to Greece to decide its own way forward. Everybody has a role to play but at the same time everybody has constraints and limitations. What we are trying to achieve today is to prepare for a very broad portfolio of reforms based on what the Greeks have signalled to the international community that they have as priority. Press conference is over. The Greek Prime Minister says the reforms he has been discussing with the OECD today are those Greece would like to introduce - not those dictated by anyone else. The re forms we are discussing with the OECD are not reforms that have been imposed upon us. No. They are reforms we would like to introduce. This is not the right time to criticise the failed programme has followed over the past four years. But on the side of the troika, what we saw was something like blackmail. \u201cIf you don\u2019t cut pensions, if you don\u2019t fire people, we will not give you this bit of funding.\u201d Tsipras says the troika never made demands based on constructive, structural reforms. So the main difference between the previous pro gramme based on the internal devaluation is that our reforms are focused on social justice. We\u2019ve had enough of austerity. Enough. We need to bring back social justice and growth. The OECD press conference has kicked off. OECD secretary-general Angel Gurria says they have been working hard on an agreement, and worked through lunch. Greek PM Alexis Tsipras said the agreement marked \u201ca new era\u201d in the relationship between Greece and the OECD, which would make reform in Greece socially effective as well as financially. We won\u2019t allow Greece to become something that it is not. At the moment Greece is at the bottom of the pile of social indicators in the EU. We are now making a break with the chronic weakness of Greece. More now on the news that the ECB has raised the threshold on emergency liquidity to Greek banks, which has been confirmed by Guardian reporter Helena Smith. Helena brings this report: \u201cI can confirm that it has happened,\u201d one banker in Athens said. \u201cIt will give us breathing space and removes part of the immediate and strong pressure but not for long.\u201d He added that the country\u2019s financial community was expecting the ECB to keep up its policy of disbursing \u201csmall injections of cash\u201d until the summer when Greece has to meet debt repayment of approximately \u20ac7.2bn. \u201cWe\u2019re worried, very worried. This kind of support does not in any way provide a cushion or comfort,\u201d he said. \u201cTheoretically, by the summer we will have reached agreement on a new bailout [deal] with our creditors but my concern is how the government and [PM] Tsipras is going to handle the mounting dissent within his own [radical left] party over conditions attached to such aid.\u201d The debt stricken country is resorting to increasingly desperate measures to ward off potential default. In the space of the past week it has raised six-month T-bills, tapped into the bank deposits of pensions and public sector salaries, postponed government payments for supplies to the public and private sector and approached the Greek subsidiaries of multi-national companies for short-term loans. Speaking to the Guardian this morning, Jens Bastien, an Athens-based analyst and former member of the European commission\u2019s task force on Greece, said the country was being pushed increasingly into a corner. In five years of attempting to avert bankruptcy, public finances had rarely been under such strain. \u201cThe combination of a growing funding gap with increased repayment obligations constitutes a tightrope walk for the government in March and an even bigger challenge come July and August,\u201d he said. Greece has signed a co-operation deal with the OECD, aimed at helping the country implement reforms. The Greek PM Alexis Tsipras - along with his finance minister Yanis Varoufakis - travelled to Paris today to meet the head of the OECD, Angel Gurr\u00eda, and other OECD officials. There will be a press conference at 15.30 Paris time (14.30 UK time), which will be streamed live here. In the meantime, a Greek official gave this update: The OECD will provide Greece with the know-how regarding the design and the implementation of reforms which are the priorities of the Greek government. In the long term, [the OECD] will help the Greek side implement and evaluate not only the progress of the reforms but also their effectiveness. German finance minister Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble has dismissed the accusation that he insulted his Greek counterpart Yanis Varoufakis as \u201cnonsense\u201d. As we reported earlier, it follows an official complaint lodged by Athens with the German foreign ministry. Speaking after the eurogroup meeting of finance ministers on Monday, Sch\u00e4uble described Varoufakis as \u201cfoolishly naive\u201d in his dealings with the media. Sch\u00e4uble told Reuters on Thursday: No, I haven\u2019t insulted my Greek counterpart, that is nonsense. That\u2019s it from Carney. He stuck by the Bank\u2019s central case that deflation is a not a major risk in the UK. He acknowledged however that inflation could stay lower for longer than the Bank of England currently expects (implying therefore that rates could stay lower for longer too). While the MPC can be expected to look through one-off shocks, it may be appropriate to take into account persistent external deflationary forces arising from the combination of continued foreign low inflation and the protracted effects of sterling\u2019s strength on the prices facing UK consumers if those forces were to intensify. Carney is now taking questions from the floor in Sheffield. He is asked what are the dangers of ultra low interest rates over a long period of time. The governor says excessive household borrowing is the key risk in the UK, particularly mortgage debt, but he emphasises the measures imposed by the Bank last year to limit excessively risky lending by UK banks. He also cites financial markets as a risk - because they are global, and the UK cannot dictate standards globally. We can however negotiate global standards, he says, adding there are signs that the financial system is now more robust. Carney says that with concerns over low inflation (driven by the global oil price slump and falling food prices), generating domestic inflation is necessary to return inflation to the Bank\u2019s 2% target. He says he expects exactly that, with inflation likely to rise to the 2% over the next two years, in a \u201csustainable manner\u201d. We are on track to do that. The UK economy is performing well. UK growth is solid, unemployment is coming down, and jobs have risen by 600,000 in the past year. Wage growth is showing signs of picking up, rising to 3% for the economy as a whole at the end of last year, and to 3.3% in the private sector. Average hours worked continue to recover on a strong upward trend. And firms\u2019 labour costs grew an estimated 1.3% in the last quarter of 2014, close to core inflation. Consumer confidence and retail sales growth are at their highest in over decade. Similarly real income growth is on course to be the strongest for more than a decade. Firms\u2019 investment intensions are robust. Surveys point to solid growth consistent with trend. There is little evidence of a deflationary mindset setting in. With domestic demand growing at around 3% in 2014, the fastest for 10 years, all these factors will underpin the momentum needed to bring domestic cost growth back to up to a rate consistent with the inflation target. The fall in inflation we\u2019ve experienced is in large part down to falling energy prices. It is not generalised \u2018deflation\u2019 proper. In our most recent forecast, the Bank expects to return inflation to target within two years and to make limited and gradual increases in Bank Rate over the next three years in order to achieve that in a sustainable manner. The Bank of England\u2019s governor Mark Carney, is speaking at the Manufacturing Research Centre in Sheffield. After running through the importance of manufacturing to the UK, Carney moves on to inflation, which is just 0.3% in the UK - well below the Bank\u2019s 2% target. Over the past two decades, Inflation Targeting central banks have established good track records of keeping inflation from being too high. But now those central banks, including the Bank of England, are being tested by inflation that is too low. Persistently low inflation can be difficult. Deflation proper \u2013 by which I mean a persistent and generalised decline in prices \u2013 is potentially dangerous. During the Great Depression, sharp falls in prices reinforced collapsing output and skyrocketing unemployment. There would be ... a more clear and present danger arising from the balance sheets of households and firms should deflation persist. This is a concern across the advanced world, where private debt levels remain very high relative to history, including the UK. [A] debt-deflation dynamic was at the core of the Great Depression and in the Japanese malaise following the collapse of the asset bubbles of the 1980s. It would be a particular concern if the pace of wage growth were to follow prices down. There is no evidence of that in the UK, where wage growth has picked up over the past six months. And more broadly, following the 2008 financial crisis debt deflation has been the dog that hasn\u2019t barked. But we shouldn\u2019t rest too easy - there are several reasons why the dog might have just been sleeping, and central banks need to be vigilant against the risk that recent low inflation stirs it from its slumber. From Reuters: 12-Mar-2015 12:27 - ECB GOVERNING COUNCIL RAISES EMERGENCY LIQUIDITY CAP FOR GREEK BANKS VIA THE GREEK CENTRAL BANK BY ABOUT 600 MLN EUROS- BANKING SOURCE More if and when we get it. Mark Carney, Bank of England governor, is scheduled to speak at the Advanced Manufacturing Research Centre in Sheffield from about 12.45. We\u2019ll be reporting any interesting snippets. The UK\u2019s trade deficit with the rest of the world narrowed in January thanks to the global oil price slump which lowered the cost of oil imports. In a boost to the chancellor George Osborne, the goods deficit was \u00a38.4bn, beating expectations of a bigger \u00a39.7bn deficit. It was the smallest since March 2014. It wasn\u2019t all good news though, because goods exports actually fell by \u00a31bn over the month (at a time when the government is hoping Britain can become a major exporter), but the deficit came down because imports fell by a bigger \u00a32.5bn. The broader trade in goods and services deficit also narrowed, to about \u00a3600m in January from \u00a32.1bn in December. In the three months to January, the trade in goods and services deficit almost halved to \u00a34.4bn compared with the previous three months. It was the smallest quarterly deficit since 2000. Sticking with the UK, there has been a flurry of news from the retail sector this morning. Losses at supermarket chain Morrisons jumped to almost \u00a3800m in the year to 1 February, following a sales slump and property write-offs. Britain\u2019s fourth-largest grocer said it would close 23 of its M local convenience stores this year, with the loss of more than 300 jobs. Read our full story here. John Lewis has cut its annual staff bonus payout to 11% of salary - the lowest in 12 years. It followed a 9% fall in profits. The bonus pool for the department store chain\u2019s 93,800 staff falls to \u00a3156.2m from \u00a3202.5m last year, when workers received 15% of their salary. Full story here. Sir Philip Green has sold off loss-making retail chain BHS for an undisclosed sum. The billionaire owner of the Arcadia group has sold the retailer to Retail Acquisitions, a newly formed company with plans to buy high street names. Full story here. Lloyds Banking Group has published a brief statement on the news this morning that Spanish lender Banco de Sabadell has made an offer for TSB. Lloyds has a 50% stake in TSB that it needs to sell by the end of the year under the terms of its 2008 taxpayer bailout. The banking group said it is willing to accept Sabadell\u2019s offer, which values TSB at around \u00a31.7bn. The Lloyds statement in full: Lloyds Banking Group plc (the Group) notes the announcement by TSB Banking Group plc and Banco de Sabadell, S.A. in relation to a possible cash offer by Banco de Sabadell, S.A. for the TSB Banking Group plc at 340p per share. The Group also notes that the Board of TSB Banking Group plc would be willing to recommend an offer at this price, subject to reaching agreement on the other terms and conditions of any offer. The Group is in discussion with Banco de Sabadell, S.A. regarding the terms of an irrevocable agreement and would be minded to accept an offer at this price if it is made, subject to reaching a satisfactory conclusion on the terms above. There can be no guarantee that an offer will ultimately be forthcoming. The Group will make a further announcement in due course, as appropriate. The Greek unemployment rate increased to 26.1% in the fourth quarter of 2014, from 25.5% in the third quarter. About 73% of Greece\u2019s jobless have been out of work for at least 12 months, the country\u2019s statistics agency revealed, classing them as long-term unemployed. In better news for the Greek economy, industrial production increased by 0.1% on an annual basis in January, following a 3.2% fall in December. In 2014, Greek industrial output fell for a seventh year by 2.7%. Jens Weidmann, policymaker at the European Central Bank and head of Germany\u2019s Bundesbank, says Greece has lost a lot of trust, and eurozone governments must decide whether to increase their risk exposure to Athens. Speaking in Frankfurt, he said the eurozone\u2019s central banks should ensure Greece\u2019s banks do not worsen their liquidity position by buying up Greek government debt for which there is still no market. Other points made by Weidmann: He does not believe Greece will regain market access by the middle of the year Long-term (eurozone) inflation expectations are anchored Negative inflation in the eurozone is just a temporary phenomenon Further evidence of an increasingly hostile relationship between Greece and Germany has emerged. Greece has lodged an official complaint with the German foreign ministry after Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble reportedly described Yanis Varoufakis as \u201cfoolishly naive\u201d in his dealings with the media. The comment, made by the German finance minister after the meeting of eurozone finance ministers on Monday, has clearly infuriated his Greek counterpart. Constantinos Koutras, a Greek foreign ministry spokesman described Schaeuble\u2019s comment as insulting. There was an official complaint from our ambassador in Berlin to the German Foreign Ministry on Tuesday night. It was a complaint after what he [Sch\u00e4uble] said about Mr Varoufakis. As a minister of a country that is our friend and our ally, he cannot personally insult a colleague. Industrial production fell by 0.1% in the eurozone in January, following a 0.3% increase in December. No sign of a boost from the weak euro. It disappointed forecasts of a 0.2% increase. The fall was mainly driven by a 2.2% fall in the production of consumer goods according to the EU\u2019s statistics agency Eurostat. The largest drops in production were in Latvia (-3.1%), and Finland (-2.5%) while the biggest increase was in Malta (+6.1%). On an annual basis, eurozone industrial production was up 1.2% in January. Jessica Hinds, European economist at Capital Economics, said the figures suggested eurozone growth in the first quarter would be weak. January\u2019s eurozone industrial production data suggest that industry had a poor start to 2015, with little evidence of any boost from the weaker euro or the lower oil price. The 0.1% fall in production was weaker than the consensus expectation of a 0.2% rise but broadly in line with our own forecast of stagnation. But, on a more positive note, December\u2019s stagnation was revised to show a 0.3% monthly rise. The country breakdown confirmed that while industrial production (excluding construction) rose modestly in France and Spain, it stagnated in Germany and fell in Italy. Looking ahead, Q1 could still match Q4\u2019s 0.4% quarterly rise thanks to the strong starting point given by December\u2019s rise \u2013 we would only need to see monthly gains of 0.2% in both February and March. And the depreciation of the euro and the lower oil price might give industry a helping hand. Nonetheless, the broader survey evidence such as the manufacturing output PMI suggest that industrial production growth is likely to remain very weak in the coming months. Accordingly, we see little chance of an imminent pick-up in the industrial sector that would drive a strong recovery in the wider economy. The UK\u2019s TSB has received a takeover approach from Spain\u2019s Banco de Sabadell. TSB shares have jumped 27% to 335p. Sabadell\u2019s is proposing to pay 340p a share, valuing TSB at almost \u00a31.7bn. The Lloyds Banking Group spin off said it was willing to recommend the offer to shareholders. The UK lender said in a statement: Based on preliminary discussions, the board of TSB believes that Sabadell could support and accelerate TSB\u2019s retail growth strategy and accelerate the expansion of TSB\u2019s presence in the SME (small and medium-sized enterprise) sector. Sabadell recognises the achievement of TSB\u2019s management and employees and would continue to operate TSB as a robust competitor in the UK banking market, building on the TSB brand name. Sabadell is a strong competitor in its home market and has developed a successful international presence in the US. Sabadell believes that the current banking industry dynamics and macro-economic environment make the UK an attractive market for future investment. The Takeover Panel has given Sabadell a \u201cput up or shut up\u201d deadline of 5pm on 9 April to announce a firm intention to make a bid or walk away (although the deadline can be extended). Greece\u2019s Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras is in Paris today to meet the head of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, Angel Gurr\u00eda. Tsipras is expected to be joined by his finance minister Yanis Varoufakis, as well as Greece\u2019s minister of state and minister for international economic relations The meeting will focus on Greece\u2019s reform proposals, which have so far fallen short of eurogroup approval. It is crucial that the Greek plans gain that approval, in order to receive a final tranche of bailout funding. Tsipras and Gurr\u00eda will host a press conference at the OECD\u2019s Paris headquarters at 15.30 (14.30 UK time). The FTSE 100 opened higher this morning and is now up 0.7% at 6,769.61, led by the miners. Elsewhere in Europe markets are mixed: Germany\u2019s DAX: -0.1% at 11,796.97 France\u2019s CAC: -0.1% at 4,995.03 Spain\u2019s IBEX: +0.2% at 11,045.40 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB: +0.2% at 22,867.16 The euro is up against the dollar this morning, following its sharp fall on Wednesday. It is up 0.7% at $1.0618 after hitting a low of $1.0509 yesterday (and briefly falling below $1.050 earlier this morning). The recent sharp falls in the euro - down 12% since the beginning of 2015 - can be explained by the deepening crisis in Greece; the European Central Bank\u2019s recently announced \u20ac1.1 trillion QE programme; and the expectation that the US Federal Reserve will raise interest rates sooner rather than later. Yanis Varouafakis - reportedly accused by Germany\u2019s Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble earlier in the week of being \u201cfoolishly naive\u201d in his dealings with the media - also acknowledged that he is ruffling a few feathers at eurogroup meetings. He told his Greek audience his fellow eurozone finance ministers were accustomed to dealing with a Greek government that ruled with e-mailed and faxed directives. The new government, he said, was different. Suddenly they realised that the Greek finance minister will be a problem for them, to the extent that he demands the right to have the Greek people\u2019s view heard. The depoliticisation if economic policy at the eurogroup has led Europe to deflation, with its people stating in Eurobarometer polls that they do not trust the European Union\u2019s institutions.\u201d Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. It promises to be another lively day, kickstarted by comments from the Greek finance minister Yanis Varoufakis. In an interview with Greece\u2019s Mega TV, Varoufakis commented on the European Central Bank\u2019s refusal to give Athens any leeway to issue short-term debt to meet its funding needs. The ECB in my opinion is pursuing a policy that can be considered asphyxiating toward our government. He suggested the ECB was hoping that by being so restrictive, it would force the hand of Greece and its creditors, increasing the urgency of an agreement on reforms. Varoufakis also had some strong words on his German counterpart/nemesis Wolfgang Schaeuble: Mr Sch\u00e4uble has told me I have lost the trust of the German government, I have told him that I never had it. I have the trust of the Greek people.",

      "body": "<p>Britain\u2019s trade balance improved in January after a dramatic fall in oil prices cut the cost of imports.</p> <p>But the higher pound and a fall in exports to the eurozone limited the gains from cheaper energy supplies brought into the UK.</p> <p>The Office for National Statistics said the total deficit shrank to \u00a3616m from \u00a32.14bn in December after a steady surplus in services trade was offset by a better than expected picture of the trade in goods.</p> <p>In the three months to January the deficit on trade in goods and services was \u00a34.4bn, which was the smallest since October 2000.</p> <p>City economists had forecast a deficit of \u00a39.7bn in the goods trade balance, only for the cheaper oil to narrow the gap to \u00a38.4bn.</p> <p>Chris Williamson, chief UK economist at financial data provider Markit, said that while the headline deficit had reduced, the underlying figures reflected a more depressing outlook for the export of manufactured goods and the government\u2019s efforts at rebalancing away from financial services.<br></p> <p>He said: \u201cThe export trend for manufacturers has weakened in a sign that the strong pound is hitting demand for UK goods in overseas markets. Further export losses look likely in coming months, dealing another blow to hopes that the UK economy is rebalancing away from domestic consumption towards exports.\u201d</p> <p>The narrowing of the deficit reflected a \u00a32.5bn drop in imports, almost half of which was due to lower imports of oil. A record surplus in services trade, much of it financial services, also helped bring the overall deficit down.</p> <p>However, goods exports growth slowed to 2.0%, down from 3.3% in the three months to December. Worse, according to Williamson, non-oil goods exports were down 1.0% in January, their first decline since last August.</p> <p>Nina Skero, a UK economist at the CEBR thinktank, said lower import costs, especially the price of oil, was a help to manufacturers, but this alone will not be enough to significantly narrow the trade deficit over the coming months. </p> <p>She said: \u201cThe most notable of these factors is the deteriorating economic climate in some of the UK\u2019s key trade partners, especially the eurozone.

      "bodyText": "Britain\u2019s trade balance improved in January after a dramatic fall in oil prices cut the cost of imports. But the higher pound and a fall in exports to the eurozone limited the gains from cheaper energy supplies brought into the UK. The Office for National Statistics said the total deficit shrank to \u00a3616m from \u00a32.14bn in December after a steady surplus in services trade was offset by a better than expected picture of the trade in goods. In the three months to January the deficit on trade in goods and services was \u00a34.4bn, which was the smallest since October 2000. City economists had forecast a deficit of \u00a39.7bn in the goods trade balance, only for the cheaper oil to narrow the gap to \u00a38.4bn. Chris Williamson, chief UK economist at financial data provider Markit, said that while the headline deficit had reduced, the underlying figures reflected a more depressing outlook for the export of manufactured goods and the government\u2019s efforts at rebalancing away from financial services. He said: \u201cThe export trend for manufacturers has weakened in a sign that the strong pound is hitting demand for UK goods in overseas markets. Further export losses look likely in coming months, dealing another blow to hopes that the UK economy is rebalancing away from domestic consumption towards exports.\u201d The narrowing of the deficit reflected a \u00a32.5bn drop in imports, almost half of which was due to lower imports of oil. A record surplus in services trade, much of it financial services, also helped bring the overall deficit down. However, goods exports growth slowed to 2.0%, down from 3.3% in the three months to December. Worse, according to Williamson, non-oil goods exports were down 1.0% in January, their first decline since last August. Nina Skero, a UK economist at the CEBR thinktank, said lower import costs, especially the price of oil, was a help to manufacturers, but this alone will not be enough to significantly narrow the trade deficit over the coming months. She said: \u201cThe most notable of these factors is the deteriorating economic climate in some of the UK\u2019s key trade partners, especially the eurozone. We expect only a moderate performance from the currency bloc in 2015, with annual GDP growth of 1.2%. As such, it is unlikely that demand for British exports among member states will increase substantially in the short run. She said the rising value of sterling also posed a problem for exporters. The pound has fallen against the dollar, but risen strongly against the euro and is up more than 5% since the beginning of the year against a trade weighted basket of global currencies. \u201cThe concerns over the country\u2019s ability to boost exports to the eurozone are further intensified by increasing strength of the sterling against the euro. Since December the pound has risen by roughly 11% against the common currency and earlier this week reached \u20ac1.40 \u2013 its highest point for more than seven years. Should this trend continue, exporters will find it increasingly difficult to maintain current levels of trade with the bloc. David Kern, chief economist at the British Chambers of Commerce said he was optimistic about the short-term prospects for trade, aided by cheaper oil, but voiced concern about the UK\u2019s reliance on such volatile factors. He said: \u201cWhile it is reassuring that progress has been made to reduce the deficit, it is important not to overstate the improvement to the figures \u2013 the strengthening of the pound makes it difficult to see the trade deficit continuing to narrow in the coming months.

Sabadell, founded in 1881 with the aim of financing local industry, reported a 50% increase in annual profits at the end of 2014 to \u20ac371.7m (\u00a3263m). Since 2007 it has doubled in size and has risen to become Spain\u2019s fifth largest bank, mainly through an energetic programme of acquisitions in both Spain and abroad. It has already acquired the LloydsTSB network in Spain and Miami, as well as NatWest Spain and the private banking business of its larger Spanish competitor BBVA in the US. At the close of 2014, the Banco Sabadell Group\u2019s assets were valued at \u20ac161.5bn. It has a network of 2,320 branches \u2013 53 of them outside Spain \u2013 and 6.4m customers.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Retail tycoon Sir Philip Green has finally washed his hands of BHS, selling the troubled fashion and homewares chain to a little-known group of City investors for \u00a31. The token sale price reflects the struggles of a high street stalwart that has been hit by competition from more fashionable alternatives such as Primark and H&amp;M. BHS has lost almost 800,000 shoppers in the past five years and been overtaken by John Lewis, TK Maxx and Sainsbury\u2019s in the rankings of Britain\u2019s largest fashion outlets. It has been leaking profits too, posting a loss of \u00a370m last year. BHS is among the venerable British retail brands such as Marks &amp; Spencer and Tesco that have struggled with a combination of aggressive newcomers \u2013 from Zara to Aldi \u2013 and the shifting tastes of shoppers. One expert said the store chain had failed to keep up with its increasingly fashion-conscious customer base. \u201cBhs is still performing well among its traditional customers, those aged 55 and over. However, this age group is choosing to follow younger fashion trends so BHS will need to refocus its offer to continue to appeal to these shoppers,\u201d said Simon Horner, head of fashion at market research firm Kantar Worldpanel. Other experts were sceptical about claims from the new owners, led by a former racing driver with no retail background, that BHS can turn back the years and reclaim its status as a big beast of the British high street. One analyst predicted that the chain will go the way of former peers Woolworths and Littlewoods, who have vanished from town and city centres. \u201cThere is unlikely to be a revival. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s a retail genius out there to recover this business as it has reached the end of its natural life,\u201d said Richard Hyman, an independent retail analyst. \u201cBHS is a variety store and its peers, like Woolworths and Littlewoods, have already closed, while even Marks &amp; Spencer is losing market share. The market has moved on. What we will see is BHS\u2019s gradual demise.\u201d Green, the billionaire retail entrepreneur whose Arcadia group owns Topshop, Dorothy Perkins, Miss Selfridge and Evans, has controlled BHS for 15 years. The business was formally owned by his wife Tina, who lives in Monaco. In 2004, when BHS was enjoying better days, the family paid itself a \u00a340m dividend from the retailer and a year later it collected a \u00a31.2bn dividend from Arcadia. \u201cIt\u2019s sad to see it go. 15 years is a long time,\u201d Green told the Guardian. As the fortunes of BHS have waned, a sale of the company has been on the cards for several years. The nominal sale price reflects the scale of the challenges facing the new owner, a group of investors operating under the name Retail Acquisitions. The group\u2019s stores need investment to bring them up to date and the company is saddled with a pension deficit valued at about \u00a3100m in 2013, according to accounts filed at Companies House. BHS employs 11,000 people and has 171 UK stores, as well as 88 franchise stores in Russia and the Middle East. Retail Acquisitions is controlled by Dominic Chappell, a former racing driver. The entrepreneur, who does not have a retail background, has been involved in a number of failed businesses including the Island Harbour development in the Isle of Wight. He fell into personal bankruptcy in 2009. In recent years a spokesman said Chappell had backed business turnarounds including a Spanish oil distribution company called Olivia Petroleum. BHS\u2019s new owners intend to work with its current management team and are aiming to draw a high-profile retailer to chair the business. They want to expand the chain\u2019s food and homeware sales. Clothes concessions from Green\u2019s Arcadia group are set to remain fixtures of BHS stores. \u201cThis is a fantastic opportunity to breathe new life into this iconic British high-street brand,\u201d said Keith Smith, Retail Acquisitions chairman. \u201cWe are convinced that with strategic and focused support we will return BHS to profitability and safeguard the workforce.\u201d A spokesperson said: \u201cThere are no big closure or redundancy plans. It is very much about driving the business forward and growing it over time.\u201d Founded in Brixton in 1928 by a group of American entrepreneurs who wanted to create a British Woolworths, British Home Stores became a stalwart of the British high street. British Homes Stores expanded rapidly in the 1970s, with its stores featuring caf\u00e9s and grocery departments as well as selling clothes. In its heyday it formed a joint venture with Sainsbury\u2019s to create the now defunct SavaCentre hypermarkets. The 1980s were tougher and it merged with Sir Terence Conran\u2019s Habitat and Mothercare to create Storehouse, which was listed on the London stock exchange. Conran changed the chain\u2019s name to BHS but even his famous design talents failed to give the chain a fashionable twist, and he later regretted buying it. Storehouse later sold BHS to Green. Storehouse later sold BHS for \u00a3200m in 2000. Green won plaudits for quickly bringing it back to profitability. It has been rumoured to be on the market for years, but he formally put the business up for sale in January. BHSreported a 3.5% fall in sales to \u00a3675.7m in 2013. That year, pretax losses narrowed to \u00a369.9m from \u00a3116m in 2012. Although the sale of BHS was expected, retail watchers were scouring the internet on Thursday for more details about the new owners. Retail Acquisitions was founded by a group of lawyers and businessmen in November 2014 as Swiss Rock Ventures, before taking on its current name in March. The venture, which has offices in London\u2019s West End, is chaired by Keith Smith, a former executive at corporate finance house Nabarro Wells. Another founding director, Chappell, 48, is said to have got the deal rolling through his business contacts with Green. Green said: \u201cThe business is handed over in a sound financial position with significant cash balances and banking facilities in place. I am confident that Retail Acquisitions Limited have a platform to grow the business and return it to profitability.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "John Lewis employees will receive their lowest bonus for 12 years after the partnership cut the annual payout for its 93,800 staff to 11% of salary. Employees of the John Lewis Partnership, which owns the Waitrose supermarket chain as well as the flagship department store, will share \u00a3156.2m in bonuses this year, \u00a347m less than last year, as profits at Waitrose dived after a competitive year for grocery retailers. In a tough year for the partnership, profits excluding tax, the bonus and one-off items dropped 9% to \u00a3342.7m. The bonus, which was announced to cheers from staff at its flagship John Lewis department store on London\u2019s Oxford Street on Thursday morning, is the lowest since 2003 when staff received 10% of salary. Last year staff received 15%. However, thanks to new legislation, this year no employee will pay tax on their bonus up to \u00a33,600.. While profits rose at John Lewis\u2019 department stores, the Waitrose chain suffered from a fierce price war among supermarkets and heavy investment in new stores and technology. The grocer posted a 24% fall in operating profits to \u00a3237m. Sales at established stores rose 1.4%, ahead of the market, and market share grew to 5.4%. But Mark Price, managing director of Waitrose, said cutting prices to compete in a \u201chighly competitive and deflationary market\u201d had cost the business between \u00a335m and \u00a345m. Price said he expected the market to remain tough and profits to remain under pressure for some time to come. \u201cTo quote Churchill: \u2018This is not the end, this is not even the beginning of the end but perhaps it is the end of the beginning.\u2019 There are dramatic changes in food retail, in shopping online, using convenience stores and eating out more. That change is going to take a long time to work through and not going to be over this year or next year. It is going to take the best part of a decade in my view.\u201d He said that Waitrose would fight back by keeping prices competitive, offering high-quality fresh food and offering more services such as in-store cafes and restaurants and online ordering. He said the company did not intend to end its contract to supply online grocery specialist Ocado under a break clause which comes into play in 2017. The challenge for Waitrose was highlighted in the latest market data from Kantar Worldpanel for the four weeks to 1 March which showed that Waitrose suffered a loss in market share for the first time since 2009. The bonus payout started in 1920. It was suspended during the second world war and the early 1950s recession, and peaked at 24% of salary in the 1980s. Priscilla Aldridge, who has worked for Waitrose as an assistant section manager for less than a year and so is receiving her bonus for the first time, said the payment would pay for driving lessons. \u201cIt\u2019s wonderful to be part of a partnership. There\u2019s a really special atmosphere in store because we feel we co-own the business.\u201d Mo Miah, who works for Waitrose in Marylebone, central London, said: \u201cEleven percent is not disappointing. Last year a lot had to be taken into consideration like the pension and holiday payments and we\u2019re opening lots of new branches.\u201d He said he would be spending his bonus on car insurance.",

Here is what analysts made of the results.</p> <h2><strong>George Scott, senior consultant at Conlumino</strong></h2> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Morrisons is the most vulnerable of the Big Four grocers to anaemic market growth and the ongoing squeeze from the discounters. </p> <p>Morrisons\u2019 attempts to get back on track have had some merit, but it has been late to the game and its initiatives appear disjointed ...</p> <p>The success of Aldi and Lidl shows that consumers want simple, everyday transparent pricing, not promotional gimmicks. Accordingly, Tesco has looked to simplify its offers, helping drive some resurgence, a lesson Morrisons should heed. </p> <p>On channels too, Morrisons has made some progress, but its moves have not been compelling enough. It added 51 [net] convenience stores over the period, growing its convenience estate to 153 M local outlets over the year, which represents an impressive rollout. However, for a format that is a world away from its Bradford market-food heritage in mid-sized supermarkets, its in-store execution doesn\u2019t play to its fresh food strengths enough, is fairly weak on food-for-now and very me-too on food-to-go. Indeed, Morrisons plans to close underperforming M local stores over 2015/16.</p> <p>Morrisons has made some decent strides online too, with annual sales reaching \u00a3200m, which is promising momentum.

      "bodyText": "Morrisons\u2019 troubles have deepened, with annual losses quadrupling following a slump in sales and big property writedowns. Here is what analysts made of the results. George Scott, senior consultant at Conlumino Morrisons is the most vulnerable of the Big Four grocers to anaemic market growth and the ongoing squeeze from the discounters. Morrisons\u2019 attempts to get back on track have had some merit, but it has been late to the game and its initiatives appear disjointed ... The success of Aldi and Lidl shows that consumers want simple, everyday transparent pricing, not promotional gimmicks. Accordingly, Tesco has looked to simplify its offers, helping drive some resurgence, a lesson Morrisons should heed. On channels too, Morrisons has made some progress, but its moves have not been compelling enough. It added 51 [net] convenience stores over the period, growing its convenience estate to 153 M local outlets over the year, which represents an impressive rollout. However, for a format that is a world away from its Bradford market-food heritage in mid-sized supermarkets, its in-store execution doesn\u2019t play to its fresh food strengths enough, is fairly weak on food-for-now and very me-too on food-to-go. Indeed, Morrisons plans to close underperforming M local stores over 2015/16. Morrisons has made some decent strides online too, with annual sales reaching \u00a3200m, which is promising momentum. Its operations are sub-contracted to pureplayer, Ocado, undermining its ability to integrate it within its core proposition compared to the likes of Tesco and Asda which link their online shops well to stores through click &amp; collect provision. Morrisons needs a clearer strategy that plays to its roots more effectively and helps it to reconnect with its traditional customer base. To this end, we believe new personnel at the top have real credibility, with the requisite experience to cope with the mammoth challenge of turning Morrisons\u2019 fortunes around. However, with price competition still intense at the start of 2015 and basket sizes showing no size of increasing, it is not yet clear how and where Morrisons can win back customers. Jon Copestake, retail analyst at the Economist Intelligence Unit Morrisons results confirm that incoming CEO David Potts will certainly have his work cut out to implement a change in fortunes. The deep fall in same store sales of 5.9% over the course of the year, coupled with the need to consolidate its convenience offering highlight the troubling competitive landscape that Morrisons finds itself in. If there is a silver lining in these figures it is that sales declines were slowing by the fourth quarter to 2.6% and that the UK retail sector and broader economy have given reason for cautious optimism for the year ahead.

      "bodyText": "Morrisons is to close 23 small stores and slash payouts to shareholders after the Bradford-based supermarket chain recorded a loss of nearly \u00a3800m last year. Revealing a set of results that underlined the scale of the challenge facing the new chief executive David Potts \u2013 who starts work on Monday \u2013 Morrisons chairman Andy Higginson warned the year ahead would involve \u201chard yards\u201d for all grocery retailers. \u201cWe have an intensely competitive market and I don\u2019t see any letup in that,\u201d said Higginson. \u201cThe outlook is for price deflation for the foreseeable future with all of that competitive pressure and the main supermarkets trying to bring prices down while we\u2019ve still got oil prices coming down.\u201d Morrisons\u2019 pretax loss widened to \u00a3792m, from \u00a3176m a year before, as sales at established stores tumbled 5.9% in the year to 1 February and it spent \u00a3315m on price cuts. Underlying pretax profits halved to \u00a3345m, a figure which was in line with expectations but nonetheless represents the company\u2019s worst performance for eight years. While the annual dividend payment to shareholders rose 5% to 13.65p, the company warned that this year\u2019s payout could fall sharply, promising only that it would be \u201cnot less than 5p per share\u201d. Morrisons was forced to write down the value of its property portfolio by \u00a31.3bn in the face of a weak outlook for sales across the mainstream grocery market which is forcing rival chains to reel in expansion plans. Supermarket property values are sliding as Tesco is closing 43 stores and has ditched plans to build 49 more, while Sainsbury\u2019s has also pulled out of building 40 stores. Morrisons is now to close 23 more of its M Local stores, a move that will cause the loss of 300 jobs, after shuttering six of its convenience stores in November and 10 smaller supermarkets in January. Higginson said there would be a \u201cpause\u201d in the development of the M Local chain as it had \u201cteething issues\u201d and needed to improve its product range and the way it planned new stores. All the UK\u2019s major supermarkets are being squeezed amid increasing competition from German discounters Aldi and Lidl, as well as upmarket grocers Waitrose and Marks &amp; Spencer, as shoppers rein in spending on their weekly food shop. Food commodity prices have also slumped in the past year thanks to strong harvests around the world. Higginson, who took over as Morrisons\u2019 chairman this year shortly after the ousting of former chief executive Dalton Philips, said the company would use its in-house food manufacturing and processing plants to help offer cheaper fresh meat and vegetables. He promised Morrisons would put more staff in stores at the times they were needed and be more innovative. He added that the key issue to be addressed by Potts, who is a former colleague of Higginson\u2019s from Tesco, would be the good execution of the group\u2019s plans. \u201cOur destiny is in our own hands. We are big enough to compete in this market but we have to compete on our own terms ... We are regaining confidence in what Morrisons customers want and what Morrisons stands for,\u201d he said. Morrisons is spending \u00a31bn on price cuts over three years in an attempt to win back customers. Last year it cut prices on 1,200 products and introduced the Match &amp; More loyalty card scheme, which provides a price guarantee against its cut-price competitors, Aldi and Lidl. George Scott, senior consultant at retail research firm Conlumino, said: \u201cMorrisons\u2019 attempts to get back on track have had some merit, but it has been late to the game and its initiatives appear disjointed. Morrisons needs a clearer strategy that plays to its roots more effectively and helps it to reconnect with its traditional customer base. However, with price competition still intense at the start of 2015 and basket sizes showing no size of increasing, it is not yet clear how and where Morrisons can win back customers.\u201d Bruno Monteyne, an analyst at Bernstein Research warned that Morrisons would not turn around performance in the short term. \u201cIn our view the continued [like for like sales falls] and a lack of a clear place in the UK retail market, means that substantial investment is required. We expect profits will still fall into next year.\u201d",

So it was ironic that while talking up the report <a href=\"http://jbh.ministers.treasury.gov.au/transcript/043-2015/\">last Friday</a> Hockey floated an idiotic thought bubble to allow first-home buyers be able to access their <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2015/mar/10/dipping-into-superannuation-for-house-could-cost-140000-in-retirement\">superannuation</a>.<br></p> <p>Certainly we have problems with housing affordability and also ensuring Australians have enough to retire on without needing the government aged pension.

The latest housing finance data, <a href=\"http://www.abs.gov.au/AUSSTATS/abs@.nsf/Lookup/5609.0Main+Features1Jan%202015?OpenDocument\">released on Wednesday by the ABS</a>, shows the percentage of first-home buyers is at near record lows:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"graph 1\">  <iframe src=\"https://charts.datawrapper.de/axYcB/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>While there is some debate over the accuracy of these figures, and the ABS <a href=\"http://www.abs.gov.au/AUSSTATS/abs@.nsf/ProductsbyReleaseDate/9EE3B041862D1F05CA257DE1001180AA?OpenDocument\">has revised</a> the way it calculates them, it is pretty clear that now is not a great time to be a first-home buyer. </p> <p>But then, if we are honest, it hasn\u2019t been a great time to be a first-home buyer for more than a decade \u2013 and now is not significantly worse a time than anytime in the past 10 years. </p> <p>One proxy we can use for housing affordability for first-home buyers is to look at the average size of the their home loans. The ABS estimates that the average first-home mortgage in January was $333,500.</p> <p>The amount varies across the states of course \u2013 in New South Wales it was $366,700, in Victoria it was $344,900 and in South Australia it was $313,300.</p> <p>Given average full-time annual earnings in 2014 was $76,767, that equates to a ratio where the average first-home loan is 4.34 times the average annual full-time earnings. Such a ratio, while up over the past year, is actually down from the peak of 4.52 reached in 2009, but it is miles above the ratio of 2.69 of 20 years ago:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"graph 2\">  <iframe src=\"https://charts.datawrapper.de/IiCPk/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>The big increase in housing unaffordability for first-home buyers (and others) occurred from the end of 2000 to 2005. </p> <p>That period coincided with the Howard government introducing the first-home owners grant (FHOG) \u2013 supposedly to offset the impact of the introduction of the GST \u2013 and when the rate of capital gains tax was lowered to 50% of the tax rate of remaining income. It suddenly made <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negative_gearing_%28Australia%29\">negative gearing</a> \u2013 where any loss you make on a rental property when interest payments are less than the rent, for example, can be deducted against other income such as the income from your job \u2013 very attractive. And it set off a housing boom. </p> <p>The total value of housing loans from September 2000 to 2001 grew by 50%. By contrast, the highest annual growth reached in the current \u201cboom\u201d was 25%:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"graph 3\">  <iframe src=\"https://charts.datawrapper.de/FL3vU/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>The first-home owners grant was a classic demand-side response to housing affordability. It just put more money into the housing market at a time when demand for housing was high. Thus, rather than make housing more affordable, it just helped spur a boom in house prices. Hockey\u2019s suggestion to allow first-home buyers to use their superannuation is much the same, only with the potential to be worse for affordability and also likely to leave people with less to retire on.</p> <p>On the surface, it sounds great. Being able to take $30,000 (or whatever amount you wish) from your super and put it on your deposit would allow you to gain access to a much larger loan. As <a href=\"http://www.businessspectator.com.au/article/2015/3/10/property/hockeys-housing-quick-fix-another-dumb-idea\">Callam Pickering</a> from Business Spectator notes, using an 80% loan-to-valuation ratio \u2013 being able to borrow 80% of the value of the property \u2013 adding $30,000 would mean you could afford an extra $120,000 loan on a house. </p> <p>But this brings two problems. </p> <p>Firstly, as a general rule, the average home loan increases at around the same rate for both first-home buyers and non-first-home buyers:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"graph 4\">  <iframe src=\"https://charts.datawrapper.de/MPfRI/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>Thus, first-home buyers with extra money to spend will not only fuel the price of houses being bought by first-home buyers, they will also increase the prices paid by non-first home buyers who would have to pay more to beat out those using superannuation to buy a home. </p> <p>Sellers, knowing first-home buyers can afford to pay more, will take advantage of that. Allowing first-home buyers to have access to more money will cause house prices to rise to somewhere that is likely to be beyond their means. Housing is not like buying groceries; it is a finite resource. And when the demand increases, unless supply also increases, prices will rise. </p> <p>For people who already own homes, this will be wonderful. The value of their existing home will increase, meaning they will have more to borrow against should they wish to buy an \u201cinvestment property\u201d \u2013 thus enabling them to take advantage of negative gearing and continue to fuel housing prices. </p> <p>The second problem is that even if a larger loan is available, that doesn\u2019t mean you can actually afford to service it. Interest rates are low now, but they won\u2019t always be. The Reserve Bank has expressed concern about the risk taken on by banks in the housing market, and thus the higher level of debt could create greater risk of default in the long run.</p> <p>And because house prices will rise, the level of debt a first-home buyer will take on will be higher than it otherwise would have been.</p> <p>So, in effect, all Hockey\u2019s policy would do is to fuel a rise in house prices without any rise in home affordability for first-time buyers. It would also be likely to restrict the number of first-home buyers entering the market. </p> <p>And as the Industry Super Australia \u2013 admittedly a vested interest \u2013 has also suggested, using $40,000 from your superannuation could reduce the amount of super you retire on by $140,000. </p> <p>Hockey told Sunrise\u2019s David Koch: \u201cI get a lot of people approaching me saying that young people should be able to use their superannuation to fund a deposit on a home.\u201d </p> <p>He should tell those people that doing so would not help them \u2013 it would only cause prices to rise and, even if they were to purchase a home, it would have been done at the cost of increasing their debt burden and reducing their retirement incomes, and it would also be likely to increase the pension burden for future governments. </p> <p>Instead, Hockey floated the idea and Tony Abbott, perhaps loyally, agreed that it was worth considering. </p> <p>Alas, the road to housing affordability is not found through increasing the demand. For a start, record low interest rates are already doing that. </p> <p>If anything, the demand needs to be reduced \u2013 abolishing negative gearing, or at least raising the rate at which capital gains are taxed from its current rate, is a must. </p> <p>When we look at the growth of home loans, over the past year the value for loans for owner-occupiers was flat, while loans for investors grew by 17.5% \u2013 they are the ones driving the market:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"graph 5\">  <iframe src=\"https://charts.datawrapper.de/FL3vU/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>Crucially, it is the supply side of the housing market equation needs to be looked at. But this is a much tougher nut to crack. </p> <p>It involves actually requires some long-term thinking. The intergenerational report forecast Australia\u2019s population rising to nearly 40 million by 2055. Yet while it talked about the impact of this on labour participation, it had nothing to say about where they were all to be housed. </p> <p>Such conversations need to address not just issues around higher density housing and public housing (which is often woefully forgotten in the debate) but also whether we need to look outside the capital cities \u2013 and what that means for infrastructure requirements. </p> <p>But <a href=\"http://www.prosper.org.au/2013/09/03/saul-eslake-50-years-of-housing-failure/\">as Saul Eslake estimates</a>, from the end of the second world war until the start of this century, the amount of housing stock increased faster than the population; since then it hasn\u2019t. Little wonder that this choke in supply has seen housing prices rise and housing affordability fall. </p> <p>It also requires getting state governments to dump stamp duty on homes. </p> <p>Stamp duty is a tax on the disincentive to sell your home and purchase another. As the <a href=\"http://taxreview.treasury.gov.au/content/FinalReport.aspx?doc=html/publications/Papers/Final_Report_Part_2/chapter_c2-3.htm\">Henry Tax review</a> noted this means a reduction in the housing stock because, for example, it creates a disincentive for elderly to sell their house and buy a smaller one \u2013 in effect leaving them with a house too big for their needs (and also in an area they no longer need for work reasons), and which could be used by another family. </p> <p>The Henry tax review found that using 2009 figures, stamp duty was nearly a 100% tax on the cost of moving:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"graph 6\">  <iframe src=\"https://charts.datawrapper.de/1Xtcf/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>It would be much more efficient to dump stamp duty and replace it with a land tax that doesn\u2019t exempt owner occupiers. Not only would it be a more stable source of revenue for state government, it would reduce a major source of friction in the supply chain of housing stock \u2013 with the added bonus of reducing the cost of buying a house. </p> <p>Hockey\u2019s remarks barely lasted a day before everyone was running to criticise them.

      "bodyText": "Is it really over? The longest squeeze on living standards since Victorian times is finally at an end \u2013 on paper at least. Across the economy as a whole, average wage growth has overtaken inflation, meaning pay is rising in real terms. But averages can mask wide differences in individuals\u2019 experience; and many in Britain will be asking themselves why they still feel no better off. How flush or squeezed households feel, more than seven years after the crisis began, will very much depend on how old they are and where they lie on the income scale. Young parents who have seen their tax credits cut and wages stagnate might balk at George Osborne\u2019s repeated claims that \u201cthe economic plan is working\u201d. But older voters, whose state pension has risen and who get an annual winter fuel allowance, could be forgiven for wondering what all the talk of a \u201ccost of living crisis\u201d is about. That is the problem with averages \u2013 with typical wages and median incomes. For anyone trying to understand official figures the picture is muddied further by claims and counter-claims that will only grow louder as May\u2019s election approaches. It is that worry, about the robustness of income data and how it can be abused, that has prompted the independent thinktank, the Resolution Foundation, to come up with its own figures. The thinktank has extrapolated from the most recent government data on family incomes and used newer earnings data to give a more up-to-date picture of household budgets. It also uses a mathematical model incorporating all the coalition\u2019s tax and benefit measures to assess the impact of changes on different demographic groups. It shows a much more nuanced picture than either main political party would have us believe. The thinktank finds that typical household incomes are rising again, but the squeeze of the last seven years has been unevenly felt. Age matters. From 2007 to 2014 households headed by someone of pensioner age saw their incomes rise by almost 10%. In contrast, typical incomes among working-age households fell by more than 4% over the same period. Matthew Whittaker, chief economist at the Resolution Foundation says the better performance of pensioner households is partly down to a less severe squeeze on wages \u2013 workers in their 20s experienced pay falls more than three times as deep as those aged over 60. Added to that is support from the \u201ctriple lock\u201d that makes sure the state pension increases in line with rising inflation, earnings growth, or 2.5%, whichever is higher. This deep divide between the way different generations have experienced the crisis is even more evident when economists look not just at day-to-day incomes, but also at accumulated wealth. Quantitative easing, the Bank of England\u2019s central recession-busting policy, tends to boost the prices of assets such as shares, helping people with hefty savings; while the housing market has bounced back strongly after dipping during the crisis. That means people who already had assets \u2013 a home, a share portfolio \u2013 before the downturn have tended to fare relatively well. A separate study by Prof John Hills, of the London School of Economics, shows that the generation born in the 1980s have barely been able to accumulate wealth; while their parents and grandparents have pocketed most of the gains of the recovery. The latest figures available, which cover 2010-12, show that the median total wealth for households aged 55-64 was \u00a3425,000, including pensions, but it was just \u00a360,000 for those aged 25-34. Older generations always tend to have more wealth but to bridge a gap of this size would require young households to save, or make pension contributions, of \u00a333 for every day for 30 years \u2013 surely an impossible feat for most. What happens next will depend critically on how rapidly wages recover from their post-crisis lows \u2013 and where the next government, of whatever complexion, decides to place the burden of deficit-cutting. But it looks highly unlikely that today\u2019s twenty-somethings will be as lucky as their parents.",

      "body": "<p>Is it really over? The longest squeeze on living standards since Victorian times is finally at an end \u2013 on paper at least. Across the economy as a whole, average wage growth has overtaken inflation, meaning pay is rising in real terms.</p> <p>But averages can mask wide differences in individuals\u2019 experience; and many in Britain will be asking themselves why they still feel no better off.</p> <p>How flush or squeezed households feel, more than seven years after the crisis began, will very much depend on how old they are and where they lie on the income scale.</p> <p>Young parents who have seen their tax credits cut and wages stagnate might balk at George Osborne\u2019s repeated claims that \u201cthe economic plan is working\u201d. But older voters, whose state pension has risen and who get an annual winter fuel allowance, could be forgiven for wondering what all the talk of a \u201ccost of living crisis\u201d is about.</p> <p>That is the problem with averages \u2013 with typical wages and median incomes. For anyone trying to understand official figures the picture is muddied further by claims and counter-claims that will only grow louder as May\u2019s election approaches.</p> <p>It is that worry, about the robustness of income data and how it can be abused, that has prompted the independent thinktank, the Resolution Foundation, to come up with its own figures.</p> <p>The thinktank has extrapolated from the most recent government data on family incomes and used newer earnings data to give a more up-to-date picture of household budgets.</p> <p>It also uses a mathematical model incorporating all the coalition\u2019s tax and benefit measures to assess the impact of changes on different demographic groups. It shows a much more nuanced picture than either main political party would have us believe.</p> <p>The thinktank finds that typical household incomes are rising again, but the squeeze of the last seven years has been unevenly felt. </p> <p>Age matters. From 2007 to 2014 households headed by someone of pensioner age saw their incomes rise by almost 10%. In contrast, typical incomes among working-age households fell by more than 4% over the same period.</p> <p>Matthew Whittaker, chief economist at the Resolution Foundation says the better performance of pensioner households is partly down to a less severe squeeze on wages \u2013 workers in their 20s experienced pay falls more than three times as deep as those aged over 60.</p> <p>Added to that is support from the \u201ctriple lock\u201d that makes sure the state pension increases in line with rising inflation, earnings growth, or 2.5%, whichever is higher.</p> <p>This deep divide between the way different generations have experienced the crisis is even more evident when economists look not just at day-to-day incomes, but also at accumulated wealth.</p> <p>Quantitative easing, the Bank of England\u2019s central recession-busting policy, tends to boost the prices of assets such as shares, helping people with hefty savings; while the housing market has bounced back strongly after dipping during the crisis.</p> <p>That means people who already had assets \u2013 a home, a share portfolio \u2013 before the downturn have tended to fare relatively well.</p> <p>A separate study by Prof John Hills, of the London School of Economics, shows that the generation born in the 1980s have barely been able to accumulate wealth; while their parents and grandparents have pocketed most of the gains of the recovery.</p> <p>The latest figures available, which cover 2010-12, show that the median total wealth for households aged 55-64 was \u00a3425,000, including pensions, but it was just \u00a360,000 for those aged 25-34.</p> <p>Older generations always tend to have more wealth but to bridge a gap of this size would require young households to save, or make pension contributions, of \u00a333 for every day for 30 years \u2013 surely an impossible feat for most.</p> <p>What happens next will depend critically on how rapidly wages recover from their post-crisis lows \u2013 and where the next government, of whatever complexion, decides to place the burden of deficit-cutting. But it looks highly unlikely that today\u2019s twenty-somethings will be as lucky as their parents.</p>",

As a fall in the number of houses coming on to the market pushed prices up across the rest of the country, the capital experienced declines for the sixth month in a row, according to the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (RICS). However, RICS suggested the falls would be temporary with surveyors expecting London prices to increase by 30% in the next five years. The RICS monthly snapshot showed 8% more surveyors reported declines in new supply than had seen rises in February. New instructions have now fallen in six out of the last seven months. While Northern Ireland and Scotland continue to outperform the rest of the UK, price growth picked up across the south west and the south-east. Nationwide, price expectations for the next three months increased from a net balance of 3% to 10% expecting rises. Despite some evidence suggesting that political uncertainty surrounding the May election could be holding back potential sellers, surveyors are now predicting nationwide house price growth of 2.4% over the next 12 months, up from 1.8% in January. Notable exceptions to this trend are London, the north of England and the east Midlands, suggesting that political uncertainty may be weighing more heavily on certain areas.

      "bodyText": "Royal Mail\u2019s capacity to deliver post across the country six days a week for the same price could come under threat from postal competition, MPs have said as they called for the regulator to take steps to protect the service. Although the universal service obligation (USO), which underpins the country\u2019s postal system, was not under immediate threat, this situation could change fast, the Commons business, innovation and skills committee said in a report published on Thursday. The Commons committee said the regulator, Ofcom, should be ready to protect Royal Mail, which has long warned of being undermined by newer entrants \u201ccherrypicking\u201d more lucrative parts of its business. In December, Ofcom said it had reviewed the market and believed that, far from Royal Mail\u2019s ability to meet its obligation being hurt by competition, it was in fact an incentive for the company to become more efficient. \u201cWhile our evidence indicated the universal service is not under immediate threat, we believe Ofcom needs to outline in more detail how it would respond quickly to changes in postal market conditions which may endanger the USO,\u201d said Adrian Bailey MP, who chairs the committee. \u201cIt is an essential service to many people, especially those living in rural areas, to those less able to travel, to older people, and also to blind and partially sighted people,\u201d he said. The MPs said Ofcom had its own overriding obligation to ensure the protection of the USO and should provide the committee with quarterly updates on the state of the service. Their warning comes at a time when Royal Mail is facing growing competition on letter deliveries from independent operators such as Whistl, an arm of the Dutch mail group PostNL, and deliveries by rivals of parcels from online retailers such as Amazon.

It is based on the assumption of a tax of 20p per litre on sugar-sweetened drinks such as colas and lemonades.</p> <p>There is <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/feb/26/call-for-ban-on-selling-addictive-energy-drinks-to-children\">increasing support</a> for a tax on sugary drinks from public health experts. In June, <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/public-health-england\">Public Health England</a> produced a <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/sugar-reduction-responding-to-the-challenge\">document</a> looking at options for reducing the nation\u2019s sugar intake, which did not rule out the option of a tax. </p> <p>Several countries including France have introduced a tax on sugary drinks, it said, but there have been no real evaluations of the impact so far. \u201cWe plan to make a more detailed assessment of emerging evidence around the effectiveness or otherwise of fiscal options to support sugar reduction and dietary health,\u201d said the report.</p> <p>The Children\u2019s Food Campaign says the impact of a tax would be greatest in places such as Slough, Manchester, Luton, Blackburn, Leicester, Birmingham, Milton Keynes, Bradford and Nottingham, which have the largest populations of young people \u2013 the biggest consumers of sugary drinks.

The Children\u2019s Food Campaign, with the help of aLiverpool University academic, has produced a tool to calculate the potential savings to the health service in any area of the country. It is based on the assumption of a tax of 20p per litre on sugar-sweetened drinks such as colas and lemonades. There is increasing support for a tax on sugary drinks from public health experts. In June, Public Health England produced a document looking at options for reducing the nation\u2019s sugar intake, which did not rule out the option of a tax. Several countries including France have introduced a tax on sugary drinks, it said, but there have been no real evaluations of the impact so far. \u201cWe plan to make a more detailed assessment of emerging evidence around the effectiveness or otherwise of fiscal options to support sugar reduction and dietary health,\u201d said the report. The Children\u2019s Food Campaign says the impact of a tax would be greatest in places such as Slough, Manchester, Luton, Blackburn, Leicester, Birmingham, Milton Keynes, Bradford and Nottingham, which have the largest populations of young people \u2013 the biggest consumers of sugary drinks.
