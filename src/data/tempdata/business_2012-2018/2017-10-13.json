      "bodyText": "The UK\u2019s biggest debt collector, Cabot Credit Management, is understood to be preparing to launch a \u00a31bn stock market flotation next week. The flotation plan is said to be back on track after being delayed because Peter Crook, the former chief executive of troubled Provident Financial, had resigned from its board. Cabot buys debts and loans in arrears from banks, utilities, telecom companies and local authorities, and then chases the borrower or customer for missed payments. If the flotation of the Kent-based company goes ahead, it will be at a time when there are mounting concerns about the debts racked up by consumers on credit cards, personal loans and to buy cars. Last month, the Bank of England said the UK\u2019s biggest lenders could incur \u00a330bn of losses on these types of consumer credit if the economy weakened and unemployment rose. The Bank\u2019s monetary policy committee is widely expected to increase interest rates from their record low of 0.25% at next month\u2019s meeting in what would be the first increase since July 2007. Cabot could not be reached to comment on the Reuters report that its flotation was back on. The firm, which is owned by US company Encore Capital Group and private equity house JC Flowers, is being advised by bankers at Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and Jefferies. It has operations in the UK, Ireland and Spain and runs a number of brands, including the Mortimer Clarke firm of solicitors, debt collection agency DLC and the Apex debt collections business. There were reports in July that private equity firm Apax Partners was considering mounting a bid for Cabot. Such a move would derail any flotation plans. Encore said in February that it was \u201cexploring an initial public offering of Cabot Credit Management, which we believe will help crystallise the value we\u2019ve created within our European franchise\u201d. At the time, the San Diego-based Encore said: \u201cSince we purchased Cabot with our partner JC Flowers, we believe Cabot\u2019s equity value has grown through operational improvement, market consolidation and expansion into other European countries. \u201cWe are in the very early stages of the IPO [initial public offering] process, but we believe that it could be completed as early as the back end of 2017.\u201d",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Provident Financial is hiring debt collection agents, after axing them earlier this year, in an attempt to revive its door-to-door lending operation, which is on course to lose \u00a3120m in 2017. As the subprime lender confirmed the cancellation of its full-year dividend, it said it was recruiting 300 more staff to collect debt payments door to door. Many of these had worked for the company before a disastrous new strategy led to a profit warning in August. The warning wiped nearly \u00a31.7bn off the stock market value of the 137-year-old group when the share price plunged from \u00a317.45 to 589.5p. The reorganisation involved replacing 4,500 self-employed collection agents with 2,500 full-time \u201ccustomer experience managers\u201d. The CEMs were given iPads but were sent to the wrong addresses, or the correct ones at the wrong time, and were unable to make sales or collect payments. As a result, debt collection rates fell. The debacle prompted the departure of Peter Crook as chief executive. The company has admitted the system \u201cwas too prescriptive in the way the workforce was managed, removing the ability of local management to prioritise and allocate resources\u201d. Provident has rehired its former debt collection chief Chris Gillespie, who quit in 2013, and is recruiting CEMs to work part-time. The third quarter trading update on Friday helped reassure the City that the situation was not getting worse as Provident enters the crucial pre-Christmas trading period, and the shares jumped by 15% to more than 900p. Manjit Wolstenholme, the chairwoman and acting chief executive, said: \u201cSince the last update, we have moved quickly to appoint new leadership in home credit who have a deep understanding of the business and recognise the importance of the relationship between our frontline staff and our customers.\u201d A replacement for Crook, who is forfeiting pay and bonuses worth up to \u00a34m, is being sought. They will take over a business facing problems in its debt collection arm and under investigation by the Financial Conduct Authority over the sale of a credit card product by its banking division, Vanquis Bank. There was no update given on the FCA investigation into how Vanquis sold a \u201crepayment option plan\u201d that allowed customers to freeze repayments on debts. Analysts at Shore Capital have estimated that consumer redress could run to \u00a3240m. The banking operation has started to become more selective about granting loans given the uncertain economic backdrop created by Brexit. Provident said year-on-year growth in Vanquis was 13%, which had been delivered against credit standards that have recently been tightened, recognising the uncertainties faced by the UK economy. Earlier this week, Vanquis was fined \u00a375,000 by the Information Commissioner\u2019s Office for sending more than 870,000 texts and 60,000 emails promoting credit cards. Satsuma, Provident\u2019s online payday lending operation, is expected to report a small loss for the year. Its website says a \u00a31,000 six-month loan would require customers to pay \u00a3896 in interest. In the debt collection arm, losses are expected to be between \u00a380m and \u00a3120m, assuming debt collection and sales continue to improve. In September, lending was down by \u00a36m a week on the same period last year, compared with the \u00a39m a week fall recorded in August. Debt collection rates, which are usually about 90%, rose from 57% in August to 65% in September. But analysts at Royal Bank of Canada remain sceptical. \u201cThe small recovery in collections should not be applauded, as this is as we anticipate and management still expects a large loss,\u201d they said. While changes are being made to the debt collection operation, the company is not reverting to its previous model of self-employed agents, but taking people on as employees. Rivals have been cashing in on Provident\u2019s problems, with Morses Club saying its business was growing after hiring agents from its bigger rival.",

    "webTitle": "FCA met Saudi Aramco before trying to change rules for $2tn flotation", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The chief executive of the Financial Conduct Authority has admitted meeting officials from Saudi Aramco before publishing plans to water down rules in an attempt to attract the $2tn (\u00a31.5tn) stock market listing of the oil giant to London. Andrew Bailey told MPs that the meeting with officials from the Gulf kingdom\u2019s state oil company, planning the world\u2019s biggest flotation, took place in the early part of this year. In July, the FCA launched its consultation on creating a new category for companies controlled by a sovereign country that are listing on the stock market. The regulator has faced criticism that weakening the rules will damage London\u2019s reputation for protecting shareholders in companies with dominant owners. But Bailey insisted the new category would not weaken protection for investors and those who invested in companies in the new group would know what they were buying. He was replying to a letter from Nicky Morgan, the Conservative MP who chairs the Treasury select committee, and Rachel Reeves, the Labour MP who chairs the business, energy and industrial strategy committee, about the background to the proposed changes and whether there had been any political interference. His response is likely to inflame the row at a time when London is vying with New York for the lucrative listing, in a battle that is regarded as a key challenge for the City in the run-up to Brexit. The Financial Times reported on Friday night that the flotation could be abandoned in favour of a share sale to private investors. In April, Theresa May and Xavier Rolet, the chief executive of the London Stock Exchange, visited Riyadh to meet Aramco\u2019s chairman, Khalid al-Falih, who is also the kingdom\u2019s energy minister. Bailey said Treasury officials had been informed about the consultation in March. Stephen Barclay, the City minister, was told in July at an introductory meeting that took place 48 hours before the publication was due to be launched. Other than that, Bailey said he had had no conversations with ministers on the subject. He said the FCA routinely had meetings with companies considering a flotation in London and would not usually disclose these. \u201cHowever, given the public discussion of these events, we can confirm that we held conversations with Saudi Aramco and their advisers in light of their interest in a possible UK listing in the early part of this year. We emphasised during those conversations that we were reviewing the listing regime,\u201d Bailey said. Morgan said: \u201cQuestions remain about the level of political involvement in the consultation. The UK\u2019s world-class reputation for upholding strong corporate governance mustn\u2019t be watered down.\u201d Reeves said: \u201cWhat may well be good for City traders is not necessarily good for the rest of the country\u2019s economy or investors.\u201d The FCA\u2019s consultation ends on 13 October and investors and trade bodies have continued to raise concerns. Ashley Hamilton Claxton, the corporate governance manager at Royal London Asset Management, said: \u201cWhile we fully support the case that the UK must stay competitive in a growing global marketplace, we do not think rewriting the rules is the correct way to go about it.\u201d Stephen Martin, the director general of the Institute of Directors, said: \u201cWe see no overwhelming reason to believe that states should be treated differently to other controlling shareholders. If anything, the risk for minority investors of having their interests ignored are greater, as the state will be subject to other domestic pressures.\u201d Bailey said in his letter that the proposals matched recommendations made by the Treasury to the FCA at the time of the budget in March. \u201cThe recommendations include the point that London retaining its position as the leading international financial centre supports the aim of sustainable economic growth,\u201d he said. The FCA proposals would enable state-owned companies to qualify for a premium listing, which has more onerous corporate governance rules and is valued by investors, but escape two key hurdles. One relates to how the company and the controlling shareholder conduct deals with each other, while the second gives investors a vote on independent directors.",

Stephen Barclay, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/jun/14/steve-barclay-appointed-city-minister\">the City minister</a>, was told in July at an introductory meeting that took place 48 hours before the publication was due to be launched. Other than that, Bailey said he had had no conversations with ministers on the subject.</p> <p>He said the FCA routinely had meetings with companies considering a flotation in London and would not usually disclose these. \u201cHowever, given the public discussion of these events, we can confirm that we held conversations with Saudi Aramco and their advisers in light of their interest in a possible UK listing in the early part of this year. We emphasised during those conversations that we were reviewing the listing regime,\u201d Bailey said.</p> <p>Morgan said: \u201cQuestions remain about the level of political involvement in the consultation. The UK\u2019s world-class reputation for upholding strong corporate governance mustn\u2019t be watered down.\u201d</p> <p> Reeves said: \u201cWhat may well be good for City traders is not necessarily good for the rest of the country\u2019s economy or investors.\u201d</p> <p>The FCA\u2019s consultation ends on 13 October and investors and trade bodies have continued to raise concerns. Ashley Hamilton Claxton, the corporate governance manager at Royal London Asset Management, said: \u201cWhile we fully support the case that the UK must stay competitive in a growing global marketplace, we do not think rewriting the rules is the correct way to go about it.\u201d<em> </em></p> <p>Stephen Martin, the director general of the Institute of Directors, said: \u201cWe see no overwhelming reason to believe that states should be treated differently to other controlling shareholders. If anything, the risk for minority investors of having their interests ignored are greater, as the state will be subject to other domestic pressures.\u201d</p> <p>Bailey said in his letter that the proposals matched recommendations made by the Treasury to the FCA at the time of the budget in March. \u201cThe recommendations include the point that London retaining its position as the leading international financial centre supports the aim of sustainable economic growth,\u201d he said.</p> <p>The FCA proposals would enable state-owned companies to qualify for a premium listing, which has more onerous corporate governance rules and is valued by investors, but escape two key hurdles. One relates to how the company and the controlling shareholder conduct deals with each other, while the second gives investors a vote on independent directors.</p>",

      "bodyText": "An uncertain day for markets saw the FTSE 100 end lower after hitting a new closing peak on Thursday. A profit warning from GKN did not help, but the index was supported by a rise in mining shares following a surge in Chinese imports. On the other hand, sterling managed to maintain its positive mood against the dollar - with the US currency weakened by disappointing inflation numbers - which in turn undermined the overseas earners in the UK\u2019s leading index. Conversely the more domestic focused FTSE 250 edged higher to another closing peak. In Europe the picture was mixed, while in the US, Wall Street moved higher despite a little uncertainty over a December interest rate rise following the inflation figures. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished down 20.80 points or 0.28% at 7535.44 Germany\u2019s Dax edged up 0.07% to 12,991.87 France\u2019s Cac closed down 0.17% at 5351.74 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB rose 0.07% 22,413.54 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended 0.17% lower at 10,258.0 In Greece, the Athens market added 1.33% to 761.35 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 41 points or 0.18%. On that note, it\u2019s time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back on Monday. Presented without comment: Back with Bitcoin, and a senior economist reckons the cryptocurrency faces a \u201cMad Max problem.\u201d Teunis Brosens, senior Eurozone economist at ING Bank says: A core element of cryptocurrency is the lack of a central authority. Nodes on the network verify transactions which are rewarded with transaction fees and in the case of bitcoins, newly minted bitcoins go with each verified block of transaction. From the verifying nodes\u2019 perspective, these new bitcoins are mined. Hence they are referred to as \u201cminers\u201d. ...One of the central issues of cryptocurrencies is trust. How can the rest of the cryptocurrency network trust the verification work done by miners? I\u2019d like to call this the Mad Max problem. In a Mad Max world, with no law enforcement, your base assumption has to be that nobody can be trusted. How to do transactions take place in such a world without anyone getting robbed? For example, malevolent miners could verify blocks of fraudulent transactions in which bitcoin is taken from victims and sent to their own wallets, or where the same bitcoin is spent several times. How do network nodes know that the blocks presented by miners are truly valid? The innovative concept applied by bitcoin is proof-of-work (POW) system. By making sure that verifying transactions is a costly business, the integrity of the network can be preserved as long as benevolent nodes control a majority of computing power. Together, they will dominate the verification (mining) process... To make the verification (mining) costly, the verification algorithm requires a lot of processing power and thus electricity. In fact, the website Digiconomist has constructed a Bitcoin Energy Consumption Index, estimating bitcoin energy consumption. And the results are sobering. At the time of writing, verifying one transaction on the bitcoin blockchain consumes about 200kWh. ...The cryptocurrency community is aware of the sheer energy consumption issue. Therefore, it is looking for alternative solutions to the Mad Max problem. One alternative may be Proof of Stake. Miners are not asked to show they put in work (computing power) in validating but to commit valuable resources beforehand, indicating they have a stake in the proper outcome. For example, miners may have to put an amount of cryptocurrency in escrow which is only released if no fraud is detected, otherwise forfeited. That sounds like a smart idea. However, it implies that only those wealthy enough to be able to put resources in escrow can join the mining process. This creates a plutocracy, which sits uncomfortably with cryptocurrency\u2019s anarchistic and libertarian roots. My conclusion is that finding a sustainable and fair solution to the Mad Max Problem is one of the biggest challenges for the cryptocurrency community today. The US inflation figure was the main focus in the day\u2019s data, says Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, and it came in below expectations: The dollar didn\u2019t get the hawkish data delivery it wished for this Friday \u2013 well, not quite anyway \u2013 leaving (an admittedly tiny) slither of doubt surrounding the potential December rate hike. The afternoon\u2019s figures weren\u2019t bad by any means. Retail sales saw a huge bounce from -0.1 to 1.6% month-on-month while consumer confidence hit its highest level since 2004. Yet those readings didn\u2019t really matter to investors, who instead focused on the fact inflation rose from 0.4% to 0.5%, not the 0.6% forecast. With a the Fed constantly mentioning their concerns about weak US inflation \u2013 and how it imperils the chances of an interest rate rise before the end of the year \u2013 it was a miss the dollar wasn\u2019t willing to indulge. Instead the greenback shed 0.2% against both the pound and the euro, while dropping 0.3% against the yen. This allowed the Dow Jones to continue its seemingly unstoppable march to daily all-time highs, with the index lurking just below 22900 following a 50 point rise. As for sterling, it\u2019s had a pretty inconsistent day. The currency\u2019s managed to hold onto last night\u2019s sharp rebound while struggling to maintain a steady grip on this Friday\u2019s more modest growth. The inflation situation in the US allowed cable to keep above $1.33; against the euro, however, it\u2019s seen \u20ac1.1265-crossing 9 day highs and sub-$1.12 lows, eventually settling just above that latter level with a 0.1% rise. More US data, and it looks like the country\u2019s consumers are in confident mood (see also the retail sales figures.) The monthly University of Michigan consumer sentiment index climbed from 95.1 in September to a preliminary reading of 101.1 for October. This is better than the dip to 95 which had been expected, and is the highest level since the start of 2004. The survey\u2019s chief economist Richard Curtin said: The October gain was broadly shared, occurring among all age and income subgroups and across all partisan viewpoints. The data indicate a robust outlook for consumer spending that extends the current expansion to at least mid 2018, which would mark the 2nd longest expansion since the mid 1800\u2019s. While the early October surge indicates greater optimism about the future course of the economy, it also reflects an unmistakable sense among consumers that economic prospects are now about as good as could be expected. This \u201cas good as it gets\u201d outlook is supported by a moderation in the expected pace of growth in both personal finances and the overall economy, accompanied by a growing sense that, even with this moderation, it would still mean the continuation of good economic times. ...Nothing in the latest survey indicates that consumers anticipate an economic downturn anytime soon - which contrarians may consider a clear warning sign of trouble ahead. Nonetheless, consumers anticipate low unemployment, low inflation, small increases in interest rates, and most importantly, modest income gains in the year ahead. It is this acceptance of lackluster growth rates in personal income and in the overall economy that signifies that consumers have accepted, however reluctantly, limits on the pace of improving prospects for living standards. The stronger US retail sales and hopes for positive company results have pushed US markets higher once more. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is up 28 points or 0.12% while the S&amp;P 500 opened 0.16% higher to reach a new peak while the Nasdaq Composite added 0.3% to a record high. Not everyone believes a December US rate rise is a certainty, especially after this latest data. John Dolan, senior dealer at FEXCO Corporate Payments, said: In the space of just a week, all bets on a December rate rise are off and the US is further than ever from solving its inflationary puzzle. While a December rate hike had seemed a strong probability after last Friday\u2019s solid wage growth data, the picture now looks much more finely balanced. As this week\u2019s FOMC minutes revealed, the Fed remains deeply concerned about America\u2019s inflation, or rather, the lack of it. Even though US wages are rising at a reasonable clip, consumer prices are still rising too slowly to require an immediate rate rise. Any December hike would therefore be driven by the Fed\u2019s desire to move rates back to more normal levels rather than by any inflationary imperative. While a final hike in 2017 remains a distinct possibility it\u2019s far from a done deal \u2013 and this uncertainty has weighed heavily on the Dollar, dragging it down against both the Euro and sterling. And from the Bureau of Labor Statistics on US inflation: More from the US Commerce Department on the retail sales: The dollar has weakened following the US data, in particular the inflation figures. But - barring political ructions - the Federal Reserve is still on track for a rate rise in February, says James Knightley, chief international economist at ING Bank: Inflation pressures are grinding higher and domestic activity is strong, suggesting that the main barrier to a higher Fed funds rate is political rather than economic. The US CPI report shows inflation pressures are rising, but this is primarily an energy story reflecting higher oil prices and refinery shutdowns relating to Hurricane Harvey. At the headline level it rose 0.5% month on month/2.2% year on year (a tenth of a percentage point below what was expected). Energy prices rose 6.1% month on month, but excluding food and energy inflationary pressures were more muted, rising just 0.1% month on month/1.7% year on year (again a tenth of a percentage point below expectations). In terms of core inflationary pressures, we are starting to see a bit more upward movement in the housing component, but medical care, apparel and education prices are very soft. Nonetheless, with the economy growing quite strongly, the jobs market looking tight with wage growth starting to show some signs of life we would expect inflation rates to creep higher.... September retail sales [data] has also been released and is strong, rising 1.6%MoM with small upward revisions to August\u2019s data. Hurricane effects are clearly visible \u2013 higher gasoline prices boosted gasoline station sales 5.8%MoM while the fact unit car sales rose to a 12 year high helped boost the value of sales with a 3.6%MoM rise. Strength can also be seen in other components and it is likely that there was some uplift as households start to replace lost items following the recent hurricanes. This has come on top of what is already a strong story for the consumer with employment, wages and confidence all looking healthy. We expect the positive story to continue into next week with industrial production rebounding following storm disruption. After all, the ISM manufacturing index is at a 13 year high, the dollar is making exports more competitive and we are seeing stronger global growth. With overall economic growth looking good, inflation pressures gradually increasing and the Fed\u2019s worries about asset valuations and financial stability becoming more prominent in speeches, a December rate hike is looking likely. The main risk remains the potential for an economically/market destabilising government shutdown. Meanwhile US retail sales have bounced back in September, albeit just shy of expectations: Newsflash: inflation across America rose last month, but by less than expected. Consumer prices increased by 0.5% in September, below the 0.6% which Wall Street expected. On an annual basis, US CPI rose by 2.2%, up from 1.9% a month ago. That puts it over the Federal Reserve\u2019s target of a 2% inflation rate. Core inflation, which strips out volatile factors like food and fuel, was flat at 1.7%. So, is bitcoin a sensible investment at today\u2019s record levels, or should you keep well away? Cryptocurrency\u2019s many supporters will argue that City institutions are waking up to bitcoin\u2019s potential (such as the ability to transfer money safely, securely, and cheaply worldwide). Two weeks ago, it emerged that Goldman Sachs has been considering whether to launch a new trading operation dedicated to bitcoin and other digital currencies. If that happens, it would arguably be the biggest endorsement yet from Wall Street. But critics argue that the recent rally is a bubble, that could burst if there is a rush to the exits. Lee Wild, head of equity strategy at Interactive Investors, says anyone considering investing in digital currencies needs to be cautious: \u201cThe value of bitcoin has almost doubled in less than a month which is clearly attracting further interest from speculators. There\u2019s evidence of growing institutional activity, too, and if China reopens cryptocurrency exchanges after the Communist Party Congress which starts next week, some believe the price could reach $10,000 by the end of the year. \u201cHowever, there could be near-term turbulence around changes to the code the bitcoin network runs on, due to be implemented in mid-November. \u201cIt is crucial that retail investors understand the many risks involved in cryptocurrency trading, not least the volatility - bitcoin has lost more than a third of its value on two occasions since June. It is clearly not for the faint-hearted.\u201d The pace of bitcoin\u2019s rally in recent weeks is quite remarkable. As this chart from Bloomberg shows, it\u2019s quadrupled in value this year, despite faltering last month when China announced a crackdown on bitcoin exchanges. Our economics editor, Larry Elliott, has been holding the World Bank to account at their Annual Meeting with the IMF in Washington: Bitcoin is having another one of those days. Having smashed through $5,000 for the first time yesterday, the cryptocurrency soared to $5,846 this morning before dipping back to $5,600 as I type. Last night, IMF chief Christine Lagarde said central bankers and regulators must take digital currencies such as bitcoin seriously, given the way they can disrupt the status quo. Many in the financial industry are struggling to come to terms with the rise of digital currencies, and unconvinced that bitcoin may be an unsustainable bubble. Jamie Dimon of JP Morgan became the poster boy for the sceptics last month, when he declared that bitcoin was a fraud that wouldn\u2019t survive. Yesterday he declined to take questions on the issue.... Sir Howard Davies, chairman of Royal Bank of Scotland, argues that the blockchain technology which underpins bitcoin should be a useful \u2018utility\u2019 to improve the financial system operate. He told Bloomberg TV this morning: I can see that a cryptocurrency like bitcoin can be useful in a blockchain context and speeding up interbank transactions. But, Sir Howard reckons that bitcoin\u2019s extreme volatility means it can\u2019t be a serious store of value for investors. UBS is also sceptical, saying bitcoin seems to be a bubble. But again, they\u2019re attracted to the blockchain -- the digital ledger that tracks digital transations. In a new report, they say: Cryptocurrencies have soared in popularity since 2008, with more than 1,000 in existence today and an aggregate value greater than the market capitalization of IBM. But we are highly doubtful whether they will ever become mainstream currencies. The need for companies and individuals to pay tax receipts in government-issued currency, and the potentially unlimited crypto-money supply, pose significant barriers to widespread adoption. We think the sharp rise in crypto-currency valuations in recent months is a speculative bubble. But while we are doubtful cryptocurrencies will ever become a mainstream means of exchange, the underlying technology, blockchain, is likely to have a significant impact in industries ranging from finance to manufacturing, healthcare, and utilities. We estimate that blockchain could add as much as USD 300-400bn of annual economic value globally by 2027. India\u2019s stock market has been swept to a new alltime high today: China also hit a milestone for iron ore imports last month, as it bought more higher-quality stocks from abroad. Bloomberg has the details: Iron ore imports by China surged above 100 million metric tons to a record, smashing the previous high set in 2015, as the country\u2019s concerted push to clean up the environment stoked demand for higher-grade material from overseas while hurting local mine supply. Newsflash: Uber has filed an appeal against the decision to withdraw its licence to operate in London. The ride hiring app lodged its appeal in the courts this morning, ensuring that it can keep operating until the issue has been addressed. The UK\u2019s judicial office has told Reuters that a heading could now take place on December 11, into Transport for London\u2019s ruling that Uber wasn\u2019t a fit and proper company to operate in the capital. Today was the deadline for Ober to formally object to TfL\u2019s decision. An Uber spokesman says: \u201cWhile we have today filed our appeal so that Londoners can continue using our app, we hope to continue having constructive discussions with Transport for London. \u201cAs our new CEO has said, we are determined to make things right.\u201d Yesterday, Theresa May once again claimed the energy market was broken as she brought forward draft legislation for a price cap. But the big six suppliers, who have around 80% of the market, lost a record number of customers in September. British Gas, EDF, E.ON, npower, ScottishPower and SSE collectively lost 163,000 customers over the month, up 127% on September 2016, analysis of official statistics showed. A significant chunk of those switchers would have been British Gas customers, prompted by the firm hiking electricity prices 12.5% for 3.1m customers. Experts at Jefferies bank said that with more than 1m people leaving the big six for challenger firms so far this year, 2017 will be a record year for switching. Next year could see that trend go into reverse, though, with households potentially lulled into complacency by the prospect of an upcoming cap. The FTSE 100 isn\u2019t sharing in today\u2019s rally. Stocks in London have dropped back from last night\u2019s record close, as the pound\u2019s recovery weights on exports. The Footsie is now down by 26 points at 7530. Other European markets are having a better day, though, helping to keep global stocks at today\u2019s record highs. Chris Beauchamp of IG reckons shares could continue to climb. The bulls have the edge, and a strong US and European earnings should stand them into good stead for the rest of the year. Sterling is rallying this morning, thanks to signals that Britain and the EU might make progress in the Brexit talks. It has risen over $1.33 against the US dollar for the first time in almost two weeks, and is also recovering against the euro. It\u2019s quite a turnaround from yesterday, when fears that talks had hit \u2018deadlock\u2019 sent the pound sliding. That, though, was before it emerged that European leaders are expected to tell their negotiators to begin \u201cinternal preparations for future trade talks with Britain\u201d at next week\u2019s EU summit. Connor Campbell of SpreadEx says sterling is on a rollercoaster ride, thanks to a report that the EU are prepared to offer the UK a 2-year transitional deal. This isn\u2019t exactly a fresh-take; a transitional period has been batted about since Brexit day dot. And [EU negotiator Michel] Barnier wasn\u2019t actually that much of a doomsayer on Thursday, stating his belief that \u2018decisive progress\u2019 was within reach in the next 2 months. But investors are being selective in what Brexit news they want to listen to, with this Handelsblatt report sending sterling sharply higher. Marc Ostwald of ADM Investor Services says the Chinese economy seems to be in relatively good health, ahead of next week\u2019s Communist Party Congress. Here\u2019s his take on today\u2019s trade data: The September Trade data painted an overall much stronger picture of domestic demand than many had been anticipating, and effectively made clear that the weaker August readings did not signal impending weakness. That said, some of the boost to imports was probably attributable to some front-loading of imports ahead of last week\u2019s National Day/Autumn Festival holiday, with more working days this September probably also giving a boost. But the strength of commodity import growth (18.7% y/y) was across the spectrum, underlining the strength of domestic demand, and as much as Exports missed forecasts at 8.1% y/y, this was still a notable acceleration from August\u2019s 5.1%. The oil price has jumped this morning, as the markets react to China\u2019s 18.7% surge in imports. Brent crude has jumped by 1.5% to $57.07 per barrel, with traders anticipating higher demand for energy. Other commodity prices are also rallying, with nickel hitting a one-month high. Iron ore and copper are also up. China\u2019s trade with North Korea slumped in September, according to today\u2019s trade data, in a sign that United Nations sanctions against Pyongyang are being implemented. Chinese imports from North Korea fell by almost 38%, including imports of iron ore and coal according to customs spokesman Huang Songping. Chinese exports to North Korea also fell, by 6.7%. More details here. Today\u2019s Chinese trade data might irk Donald Trump. According to Reuters, China\u2019s trade surplus with the US has hit an all-time high. Reuters reports: China\u2019s trade surplus with the United States in September rose to $28.08 billion versus $26.23 billion last month, Chinese customs data on Friday showed. The surplus was the highest ever with the U.S. for any single month, based on Reuters calculations based on official data going back to 2008. China\u2019s Jan-Sept trade surplus with the U.S. was $195.54 billion, the data showed. That could give fresh ammunition to U.S. President Donald Trump, who has long complained that the trade imbalance between the two nations hurts the U.S. economy. The strong Chinese trade data sent MSCI\u2019s All-Country World Share index up to a new peak, at 494.84 points. The index, which tracks equities across the globe, has been rising steadily this year: Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. World stock markets are touching new record highs this morning, after new Chinese trade data indicated the global economy was strengthening. China smashed forecasts overnight, reporting that imports surged by a remarkable 18.7% per year in September. Exports rose by 8.1%, a little below forecasts but still a solid result. The leap in imports suggests that Chinese factories are continuing to see strong demand for their products; an encouraging sign for world growth. Beijing\u2019s policymakers will be pleased, as they prepare for next week\u2019s Communist Party Congress. This also means that China\u2019s trade surplus has narrowed, as Shane Oliver, chief economist of AMP Capital, shows here: Chinese government officials have hailed the data, saying it shows the country\u2019s economy is on track. CNBC has the details: Huang Songping, spokesman for the Customs department told a press conference on Friday that trade for the first three quarters improved due to a recovery in overall global and domestic economic environment. There has been a return in global demand, he added. Barring unforeseen events, China\u2019s will post double-digit growth in foreign trade this year, said Huang. Chi Lo, senior economist at BNP Paribas Investment Partners, called the data \u201cpretty good\u201d, adding: \u201cIt seems the global demand is still there to support the demand for Chinese exports.\u201d Michael Hewson of CMC Markets agrees, saying: This morning\u2019s Chinese trade data was fairly supportive of a fairly robust domestic economy. Asian stock markets rose to a 10-year high following the data, while Japan\u2019s Nikkei struck at 21-year high: Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 joined the party last night, hitting a new record closing high. That was partly down to a weaker pound, but it\u2019s worth noting that the more domestically-focused FTSE 250 also hit a new high. Here\u2019s our story: The Times also gave it a good show: Here\u2019s the agenda for the day: 1.30pm BST: US inflation data for September. Prices are expected to have risen by 0.6% during the month. A strong reading raises the chances of a US interest rate rise. From 2pm BST: The IMF and the World Bank\u2019s Annual Meeting continues. Central bank chiefs, finance ministers, economists and investors will bd discussing the state of the global economy 3pm BST: The University of Michigan\u2019s US consumer confidence report. 6pm BST: The weekly Baker Hughes oil rig count. A good measure of whether oil producers are ramping up output, or cutting back We\u2019ll also have an eye on Bitcoin, which smashed through $5,000 to a record high yesterday.",

Nodes on the network verify transactions which are rewarded with transaction fees and in the case of bitcoins, newly minted bitcoins go with each verified block of transaction. From the verifying nodes\u2019 perspective, these new bitcoins are mined. Hence they are referred to as \u201cminers\u201d. </p> <p>...One of the central issues of cryptocurrencies is trust. How can the rest of the cryptocurrency network trust the verification work done by miners? I\u2019d like to call this the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mad_Max\">Mad Max problem</a>. In a Mad Max world, with no law enforcement, your base assumption has to be that nobody can be trusted. How to do transactions take place in such a world without anyone getting robbed?</p> <p>For example, malevolent miners could verify blocks of fraudulent transactions in which bitcoin is taken from victims and sent to their own wallets, or where the same bitcoin is spent several times. How do network nodes know that the blocks presented by miners are truly valid? </p> <p>The innovative concept applied by bitcoin is proof-of-work (POW) system. By making sure that verifying transactions is a costly business, the integrity of the network can be preserved as long as benevolent nodes control a majority of computing power. Together, they will dominate the verification (mining) process...</p> <p>To make the verification (mining) costly, the verification algorithm requires a lot of processing power and thus electricity. In fact, the website Digiconomist has constructed a <a href=\"https://digiconomist.net/bitcoin-energy-consumption\">Bitcoin Energy Consumption Index</a>, estimating bitcoin energy consumption. And the results are sobering. At the time of writing, verifying one transaction on the bitcoin blockchain consumes about 200kWh.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"443e9f14a707164845dc678210a040aecb3ad5bd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/443e9f14a707164845dc678210a040aecb3ad5bd/0_135_4072_2444/1000.jpg\" alt=\"2017 Atlases Russian Business Forum, Day 2MOSCOW REGION, RUSSIA - OCTOBER 6, 2017: Bitcoin cryptocurrency souvenir coins at the 2017 Atlases Russian Business Forum at the Crocus City Hall.

Therefore, it is looking for alternative solutions to the Mad Max problem.</p> <p>One alternative may be Proof of Stake. Miners are not asked to show they put in work (computing power) in validating but to commit valuable resources beforehand, indicating they have a stake in the proper outcome. For example, miners may have to put an amount of cryptocurrency in escrow which is only released if no fraud is detected, otherwise forfeited.</p> <p>That sounds like a smart idea. However, it implies that only those wealthy enough to be able to put resources in escrow can join the mining process. This creates a plutocracy, which sits uncomfortably with cryptocurrency\u2019s anarchistic and libertarian roots.</p> <p>My conclusion is that finding a sustainable and fair solution to the Mad Max Problem is one of the biggest challenges for the cryptocurrency community today.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-59e0d07601a8e6075b954bee\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-10-13T14:42:41.063Z\">3.42pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The US inflation figure was the main focus in the day\u2019s data, says Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, and it came in below expectations:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The dollar didn\u2019t get the hawkish data delivery it wished for this Friday \u2013 well, not quite anyway \u2013 leaving (an admittedly tiny) slither of doubt surrounding the potential December rate hike.</p> <p>The afternoon\u2019s figures weren\u2019t bad by any means. Retail sales saw a huge bounce from -0.1 to 1.6% month-on-month while consumer confidence hit its highest level since 2004.

Instead the greenback shed 0.2% against both the pound and the euro, while dropping 0.3% against the yen. This allowed the Dow Jones to continue its seemingly unstoppable march to daily all-time highs, with the index lurking just below 22900 following a 50 point rise.</p> <p>As for sterling, it\u2019s had a pretty inconsistent day. The currency\u2019s managed to hold onto last night\u2019s sharp rebound while struggling to maintain a steady grip on this Friday\u2019s more modest growth.

Nonetheless, consumers anticipate low unemployment, low inflation, small increases in interest rates, and most importantly, modest income gains in the year ahead.

But - barring political ructions - the Federal Reserve is still on track for a rate rise in February, says James Knightley, chief international economist at ING Bank:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Inflation pressures are grinding higher and domestic activity is strong, suggesting that the main barrier to a higher Fed funds rate is political rather than economic.</p> <p>The US CPI report shows inflation pressures are rising, but this is primarily an energy story reflecting higher oil prices and refinery shutdowns relating to Hurricane Harvey. At the headline level it rose 0.5% month on month/2.2% year on year (a tenth of a percentage point below what was expected). Energy prices rose 6.1% month on month, but excluding food and energy inflationary pressures were more muted, rising just 0.1% month on month/1.7% year on year (again a tenth of a percentage point below expectations).</p> <p>In terms of core inflationary pressures, we are starting to see a bit more upward movement in the housing component, but medical care, apparel and education prices are very soft. Nonetheless, with the economy growing quite strongly, the jobs market looking tight with wage growth starting to show some signs of life we would expect inflation rates to creep higher....</p> <p>September retail sales [data] has also been released and is strong, rising 1.6%MoM with small upward revisions to August\u2019s data. Hurricane effects are clearly visible \u2013 higher gasoline prices boosted gasoline station sales 5.8%MoM while the fact unit car sales rose to a 12 year high helped boost the value of sales with a 3.6%MoM rise. Strength can also be seen in other components and it is likely that there was some uplift as households start to replace lost items following the recent hurricanes. This has come on top of what is already a strong story for the consumer with employment, wages and confidence all looking healthy.</p> <p>We expect the positive story to continue into next week with industrial production rebounding following storm disruption.

    "webTitle": "Big six energy firms lose 163,000 customers as British Gas raises prices", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The big six energy companies suffered a record exodus of more than 160,000 customers to smaller rivals in September, as British Gas increased electricity prices for millions of households. A monthly all-time high of 163,000 people left the largest suppliers \u2013 British Gas, EDF, E.ON, Npower, SSE and ScottishPower \u2013 which have about 80% of the market. The surge in customers ditching the big six comes as Theresa May reiterated her claim the market was broken and ministers published draft legislation to cap bills for up to five years. Jefferies investment bank said 1.1 million customers had already switched this year from the big six to smaller competitors, up 18% on the same period last year. The big six are likely to see their finances squeezed further by May\u2019s cap and competition from challenger firms, the bank warned. \u201cIntense competition, combined with the recent announcement of a standard variable tariff price cap, is likely to only magnify UK retail market woes for the big six,\u201d it said. The industry trade body, Energy UK, hailed the switching figures as a sign that \u201ccompetition continues to flourish\u201d. Much of the migration will have been spurred by British Gas hiking its electricity prices 12.5% for 3.1 million of its customers from 15 September. The company was the last of the big six to increase its tariffs, following a round of price rises at the start of the year. Robert Buckley, research director at energy experts Cornwall Insight, said the statistics showed the market was working. \u201cThis just shows that the market is busier and more competitive than ever,\u201d he said. He agreed with Jefferies\u2019 prediction that 2017 is likely to be a record year for switching. However, Buckley warned that May\u2019s cap, expected to take effect in late 2018 or early 2019, could see the growth in switching stall as consumers are lulled into complacency over bills. \u201cI think there\u2019s a real risk with any price cap that people who haven\u2019t engaged with the market think that they\u2019ll be OK not to,\u201d he said. Smaller suppliers such as Ovo and First Utility have been taking about one percentage point of market share every quarter for the last four years, and many of them have welcomed a price cap as their existing tariffs are already well below the level of any likely ceiling. But there are fears in the industry that even the prospect of a cap could make consumers think they are protected and therefore stick with big suppliers. Several of the big six have already reported large customer losses this year, with SSE shedding nearly 250,000 between March and June, and Scottish Power down by 100,000 in the first half of the year. The chief executive of the UK\u2019s biggest energy company, British Gas owner Centrica, this week questioned whether the cheap rates offered by some companies were sustainable. \u201cMany of the companies who have entered the market currently don\u2019t make any money. One of the things that one needs to watch out for is, is the current market actually sustainable?\u201d said Iain Conn, who has been a vocal critic of a price cap. The managing director of Centrica\u2019s domestic retail business will be questioned by MPs on Tuesday on the impact of a cap, along with the chief executive ofOvo and the head of the energy regulator, Ofgem.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "James Murdoch has narrowly survived a rebellion by independent Sky shareholders to be re-elected as chair of the British satellite broadcaster. Just 51.6% backed Murdoch to stay in the top job. Concern among the dissenters centres around what they see as a potential conflict of interest, given his role as chief executive of 21st Century Fox, which is trying to buy Sky in an \u00a311.7bn deal. Only 36% of independent investors , however, supported the company\u2019s remuneration report. The total pay package for Sky\u2019s chief executive, Jeremy Darroch, quadrupled to more than \u00a316m in the year to the end of June, despite a hefty fall in annual profits at the broadcaster\u2019s UK and Ireland business. About \u00a312m of this came from a one-off payment from a long-term incentive scheme, but he also received an annual bonus of \u00a31.9m. The City investment group Royal London said Murdoch\u2019s role as chair was inappropriate and that the company needed a \u201ctruly independent\u201d chair. It also said executive pay at Sky was too complex and that bosses could receive huge payouts if the Fox deal went through. Three major shareholder advisory groups \u2013 Institutional Shareholder Services, Glass Lewis and Pirc \u2013 had also urged investors to oppose executive pay at the group and Murdoch\u2019s re-election. Despite their position, Murdoch\u2019s level of support actually increased from 47% last year, and the votes attached to Fox\u2019s 39% shareholding in Sky meant that both his reappointment and the remuneration report were approved comfortably overall. Fox\u2019s bid for the 61% of Sky that it does not already own is being investigated by the Competition and Markets Authority on the basis of media plurality and broadcasting standards. The culture secretary, Karen Bradley, announced last month that she was referring the deal to the CMA after a review by the media regulator, Ofcom, created \u201csufficient uncertainty\u201d about the deal. Murdoch said at the Sky annual meeting that the companies were \u201cengaged constructively with the regulatory authorities\u201d about the deal. He refused, however, to answer questions from investors about whether Sky\u2019s reputation could be insulated from the sexual harassment scandal at Fox News, which led to the departure of its chair, Roger Ailes, and anchor Bill O\u2019Reilly. He also refused to comment on whether Fox was getting a \u201csweetheart deal\u201d on the price it would pay for Sky. One shareholder, who did not give his name, said to Murdoch: \u201cI have the same problem with my dad. Even though I wasn\u2019t talented, he put me in charge.\u201d In response to the question about the Fox News scandal, Darroch said the \u201cwhole board are incredibly supportive and behind Sky\u201d and that it wanted to make a \u201cbroader contribution\u201d to society. Martin Gilbert, the deputy chair, said the board had looked at the Fox takeover in the best interests of shareholders and had had \u201cimpartial discussions\u201d that did not include Murdoch or other Sky directors with connections to Fox. Gilbert added: \u201cI am not going to comment on the 21st Century Fox issues because this is the AGM of Sky, but I am pretty confident that it will not have an effect on the CMA\u2019s investigation.\u201d",

    "webTitle": "Adani says it will break ground on Carmichael rail link 'within days'", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The Adani Group has said it will \u201cbreak ground within days\u201d on the rail link for its Carmichael coalmine and has claimed daily progress on a project for which it still needs to secure about $5bn in finance. The Adani Mining chief executive, Jeyakumar Janakaraj, said in a statement on Friday the company remained \u201cconfident and committed\u201d to delivering its first coal shipment in March 2020. Janakaraj said pre-construction works on the Galilee basin mine site and the 388km rail corridor to its Abbot Point port were \u201cwell advanced\u201d. \u201cEvery day we are moving forward. Milestones are being achieved every day,\u201d he said. \u201cWe will break ground within days to mark the official start of work on the rail link.\u201d Adani\u2019s announcement on Friday coincided with the release of another poll showing a significant majority of Australians were opposed to the mine. Roy Morgan\u2019s survey of 1,547 people last weekend found 77% of those who had heard of the mine thought it should not go ahead. This included a majority of voters of all political stripes who were against the mine, including 55.5% of National party supporters. Almost a quarter of people surveyed hadn\u2019t heard of Adani. Adani is yet to secure a federal government concessional loan of up to $900m for the rail line through the Northern Australia Infrastructure Facility. Its most recent deadline for financial closure on the mine and rail project is still months away, and the Indian energy group is looking overseas to secure finance by March.1 Adani also has to refinance $1.48bn of borrowings on the Abbot Point port by November 2018 and a cumulative debt of $2.11bn \u2013 more than the port is worth \u2013 by 2020. A recent report by the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis (IEEFA) said a looming shortfall in coal throughput at Abbot Point meant the prospect of the Carmichael mine filling that gap was critical to Adani\u2019s refinancing bid on the port. This week, Westpac joined another of the port\u2019s original financiers, Deutsche Bank, in appearing to rule out refinancing because of a new climate policy mandating investments only in existing coal basins. Adani is also yet to register an Indigenous land use agreement with the mine site\u2019s traditional owners amid continuing legal challenges from within the group. An Adani spokesman did not return calls on Friday. IEEFA analyst Tim Buckley predicts that for the first phase of production, Adani will have to spend $2bn for a mine digging out up to 25m tonnes of coal a year, and $3.3bn for the rail project. Adani has spent $3.5bn in Australia so far, all of it funded through debt, including more than $2bn on the port and $680m to buy the mine site land from Linc Energy and Clive Palmer. Janakaraj said in the statement that the pre-construction work, funded by an injection of up to $400m from Adani Enterprises in India, included teams doing \u201ccultural heritage inspections and recordings\u201d at the mine and rail sites.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The Federal Reserve chair, Janet Yellen, will end her term in February, and Donald Trump has yet to say if he will follow tradition and renominate the Obama-appointed incumbent to a second term \u2013 or nominate someone of his own choosing. Despite Trump\u2019s assertion over the summer that he was considering Yellen\u2019s renomination, Wall Street is betting against that outcome. The president, true to form, is fueling anticipation. Last month he said he \u201chad four meetings for Fed chairman, and I\u2019ll be making a decision over the next two or three weeks\u201d. The decision is one of the most important for the president, and comes at a critical moment for the central bank as it begins to trim its massive $4.4tn balance sheet, built up over almost a decade of asset-purchasing designed to boost the US economy and stabilize markets after of the 2008 financial crisis. At the same time, the Fed is moving to inch up the cost of borrowing, which could begin to cool parts of the economy accustomed to near-zero interest rates. The latest Fed minutes show that board members remain anxious about stubbornly low inflation. \u201cMany participants expressed concern that the low inflation readings this year might reflect not only transitory factors, but also the influence of developments that could prove more persistent,\u201d according to minutes of the 19-20 September meeting, released on Wednesday in Washington. \u201cThe Fed chair always faces tough issues,\u201d said Nellie Liang of the Brookings Institution. For good reason, then, markets are watching Trump\u2019s signaling on the Fed chair nomination with hawk eyes. Larry Fink, the CEO of Blackrock, the fund giant with $6tn in assets, warned this week that central bankers need to tread carefully as they normalize monetary policy or risk short-term interest rates exceeding the long-term rates \u2013 a reliable signal of an approaching recession. \u201cMy greatest fear \u2026 is that we have a very aggressive Federal Reserve,\u201d Fink told CNBC. But Trump\u2019s choice seems wide open. \u201cThere are still ongoing interviews,\u201d the White House chief of staff, John Kelly, said on Thursday. \u201cAll of the people that have been in to interview have been really first-round draft choices, and we have more to come.\u201d Trump attacked Yellen relentlessly during the campaign, accusing her of creating a \u201cfalse stock market\u201d with low interest rates. Nowadays Trump claims to be a \u201clow interest-rate person\u201d and frequently takes credit for the record stock market. \u201cJanet Yellen has done a superb job over the past four years and deserves to be reappointed,\u201d said Andrew Levin, a professor of economics at Dartmouth College. Under Yellen\u2019s leadership, the US economy has expanded by nearly 10 million jobs. If she is not renominated by the new president \u2013 a tradition that serves to underscore the central bank\u2019s political independence \u2013 she would be only the third Fed leader to serve a single term since 1934. Yellen has not said if she would accept a second term if offered. \u201cEveryone recognizes that she has a remarkable amount of common sense, and avoids relying on any single model or statistical method,\u201d Levin said. \u201cShe has adeptly managed to build a consensus among Fed officials in the complex process of launching the normalization of interest rates and the Fed\u2019s balance sheet.\u201d If Trump chooses to replace Yellen, her presumptive successor had been seen as Gary Cohn, the former Goldman Sachs banker and current White House chief economic adviser. But Cohn is now seen as a fading star after public criticism of Trump\u2019s response to the Charlottesville violence. Cohn\u2019s fall from grace boosts the prospects of former Fed governor Kevin Warsh. Warsh was appointed to the central bank\u2019s board by George W Bush aged just 35, the youngest appointment in its history, and has been highly critical of efforts to use quantitative easing to lower long-term interest rates, warning that it increased the risks of a financial bubble. Writing in the Wall Street Journal last year, Warsh said the Fed\u2019s recent actions had been \u201cconfusing\u201d, \u201cerratic\u201d and described the body as \u201cpoorly positioned to respond with force, efficacy and credibility\u201d. Warsh appears to share Trump\u2019s stance on the stock market, and on Wall Street deregulation. He also warned that the Fed\u2019s \u201crecent centennial as our nation\u2019s central bank should not be confused with its permanent acceptance in the American political system\u201d \u2013 a position he repeated in June. \u201cThe idea that we [the Fed] are a permanent fixture in the economy is mistaken,\u201d he warned. Warsh is married to Jane Lauder, the granddaughter of cosmetics icon Est\u00e9e Lauder. Her billionaire father, New York businessman Ronald Lauder, launched a cologne in 2004 called Donald Trump, the Fragrance. Lauder, a former ambassador to Austria, has reportedly been leaning on the White House to name his son-in-law to the position. Also on Trump\u2019s shortlist is current Fed governor Jerome \u201cJay\u201d Powell, a moderate Republican and former investment banker widely considered a compromise candidate. Lauder and Powell favor looser financial regulations, but Powell offers greater continuity to the Yellen and Ben Bernanke eras in terms of monetary policy. He has also called for easing some of the 2010 Dodd-Frank regulations including the Volcker rule, which prevents banks from making certain kinds of speculative bets. Powell has also said it might be appropriate to ease some of the annual stress tests that big banks are required to perform. \u201cI don\u2019t think what we\u2019re talking about here amounts to broad deregulation,\u201d Powell said in June. \u201cI think it amounts to making regulation more efficient.\u201d \u201cPowell has consistently supported the Fed\u2019s strategy of \u2018gradual normalization\u2019 of interest rates and the balance sheet, and he has opposed using simple rules as benchmarks for monetary policy.\u201d On Wednesday, Trump, the treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, and Vice-President Mike Pence interviewed Stanford University economist John Taylor to discuss his potential nomination. Taylor has consistently argued that the Fed should have raised interest rates sooner after the 2008 crisis, and that the bank\u2019s discretionary policies are ineffective. \u201cTaylor has been a strong advocate that the Fed should explain its strategy in terms of a simple benchmark rule, while Warsh has criticized the Fed for being too opaque and inertial, but hasn\u2019t been specific about how the Fed should determine or communicate its strategy,\u201d said Levin. Others in the mix include John Allison, the former chief executive of BB&amp;T. Trump is understood to have offered Allison a position on the central bank\u2019s board of governors. So which way will Trump jump? Continuity under Powell, or a more radical approach under Warsh \u2013 or someone else altogether? The statistical website PredictIt placed Powell at 52% likelihood, Warsh at 32%, Taylor at 13% and Yellen at 10%.",

    "webTitle": "Christian Candy sells New York penthouse after slashing price", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The multimillionaire property developer Christian Candy has sold a three-storey penthouse above the Plaza Hotel in New York City for $32.7m (\u00a324.6m) \u2013 almost half the original asking price. New York City property records show the 6,319 sq ft (587 sq m) penthouse with sweeping views of Central Park was sold for $26.3m less than Candy had first listed the apartment for in 2013. Candy, best known for the luxury One Hyde Park complex he developed with his brother Nick, has sold or remortgaged more than \u00a3300m of assets over the past year. The sale of the Plaza penthouse comes shortly before a high court judge is expected to rule on the brothers\u2019 bitter legal dispute with their former friend and businessman Mark Holyoake, who is suing the Candys for \u00a3132m in damages after they fell out over a loan. A spokesman for Christian Candy did not respond to requests for comment about the timing of the sale. He bought the penthouse, which spans floors 19 to 21 of the hotel, from Andrei Vavilov, a former Russian finance minister and hedge fund manager, for $26m in 2012. Vavilov had sued the penthouse\u2019s developer, claiming that what was sold to him as the \u201cepitome of luxury\u201d was little more than an \u201cattic-like space\u201d. The One Hyde Park developer had hoped that his makeover skills would attract a super-rich buyer to spend $59m when he first listed it in 2013. At the time, the brochure for the four-bedroom property with five bathrooms said: \u201cThe penthouse is being delivered with custom furnishings personally selected by world renowned design firm Candy &amp; Candy. They have created a contemporary New York loft-style residence in an uptown setting.\u201d Christian Candy reduced the price to $49.9m in 2015. Previous Guardian research suggested that Christian Candy had sold, mortgaged or listed for sale eight homes and developments, including a villa on the French Riviera and a seven-bedroom, seven-bathroom house in London with a swimming pool and staff quarters.

A spokesman for Christian Candy did not respond to requests for comment about the timing of the sale.</p> <p>He bought the penthouse, which spans floors 19 to 21 of the hotel, from Andrei Vavilov, a former Russian finance minister and hedge fund manager, for $26m in 2012. Vavilov had sued the penthouse\u2019s developer, claiming that what was sold to him as the \u201cepitome of luxury\u201d was little more than an \u201cattic-like space\u201d. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b0821837257b8c88a0cfff088d539da8fccedc16\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b0821837257b8c88a0cfff088d539da8fccedc16/0_90_2064_1238/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Christian Candy, right, and Nick Candy\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Christian Candy, right, and Nick Candy arrive at the high court during their dispute with Mark Holyoake.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mark Thomas/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The One Hyde Park developer had hoped that his makeover skills would attract a super-rich buyer to spend $59m when he first listed it in 2013. At the time, the brochure for the four-bedroom property with five bathrooms said: \u201cThe penthouse is being delivered with custom furnishings personally selected by world renowned design firm Candy &amp; Candy. They have created a contemporary New York loft-style residence in an uptown setting.\u201d Christian Candy reduced the price to $49.9m in 2015.</p> <p>Previous Guardian research suggested that Christian Candy had sold, mortgaged or listed for sale eight homes and developments, including a villa on the French Riviera and a seven-bedroom, seven-bathroom house in London with a swimming pool and staff quarters.</p> <p>The disposals have prompted legal letters from Holyoake.
