      "bodyText": "The new boss of the John Lewis department store chain has warned of more job cuts this year and possible price rises as she said shoppers\u2019 behaviour was changing \u201cprofoundly and fast\u201d. Paula Nickolds, who took charge of middle England\u2019s favourite store three months ago, said the department store needed to modernise and become more efficient in the face of rising costs, the move to online shopping and a tough economic environment. Last month John Lewis, which is owned by its staff, revealed plans to cut nearly 800 jobs in its store restaurants and administration and Nickolds said more jobs would go this year as it automates and simplifies routine processes behind the scenes so that staff can focus on serving shoppers. She declined to say when and where the redundancies would be made, saying staff would be told first. As part of its efforts to modernise and keep customers coming into stores rather than just shopping from their sofas, Nickolds said the chain would be providing more services \u2013 from beauty salons to an appointment system for customers to consult with expert store staff about potential purchases. Nickolds said the company would not be using more agency workers rather than directly employed staff \u2013 who are called partners and who share in an annual profit-related bonus and get a range of other benefits, including access to John Lewis-owned holiday homes. The cuts come as Nickolds warned that the retailer had started to see signs of uncertainty among its customers about their personal finances in the wake of the Brexit vote. Until now retailers have said there had been little sign of a slowdown in spending. \u201cCustomers are feeling a little less certain of their financial security and that is starting to come through in our conversations [with them],\u201d she said, adding this was likely to continue throughout this year. Nickolds said the 16% decline in the value of the the pound since the EU referendum had resulted in \u201ca dramatic impact on input pricing\u201d. However, it was not yet clear how much of the cost increases would be passed on to shoppers as price rises partly depended on competitors\u2019 actions. Some retailers are choosing to take a hit on profit and keep prices low to ensure they can keep pulling in shoppers. \u201cThe two most significant concerns over the next couple of years are our trading arrangements and at least as important, and probably more so, is the experience for EU nationals working in John Lewis.\u201d Less than 5% of John Lewis\u2019s workforce are EU nationals \u2013 but that is still up to 2,000 people \u2013 many of whom are in the distribution operations which service the retailer\u2019s fast-growing online store. A tightening of access to workers could fuel wage inflation at a time where John Lewis is trying to cut costs. Nickolds said it was already clear that retail in general would be \u201ca structurally less profitable operation than it was\u201d, with too many stores on the high street and costs rising. Nickolds, 44, has climbed through the ranks at the retailer since joining as a graduate trainee 23 years ago. She took over the top job when her predecessor Andy Street quit to stand as the Conservative candidate for mayor of the West Midlands. She added that John Lewis would also be trying to boost sales by merging digital and store-based services. Her plan includes providing John Lewis staff with tablet computers so they can give shoppers information or take payment without visiting a till.",

    "webTitle": "Leading City firms begin to lay groundwork for London jobs exodus", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "A growing number of leading City firms have revealed they are now laying the groundwork for an exodus of thousands of jobs from London after Britain\u2019s vote to leave to EU. Just a day after Theresa May formally triggered the process for Brexit it was confirmed that the insurers Lloyd\u2019s of London and Royal London are setting up subsidiaries outside the UK, while the investment banks JP Morgan and Citigroup are actively exploring the relocation of key operations. Luxembourg also threw its hat into the ring in the battle to attract the European Banking Authority, which employs 159 people at Canary Wharf in London. Frankfurt and Paris also want to host the organisation. JP Morgan is in talks to buy an office building in Dublin big enough to hold more than 1,000 workers, increasing speculation that it will move a substantial number of jobs from London as a result of Brexit. Citigroup said it was planning for a hard Brexit that would require \u201crelocating certain client-facing roles to the EU from the UK\u201d. A number of banks and insurers have already confirmed they could move staff. Goldman Sachs is to move hundreds of bankers to Frankfurt and Paris, while HSBC could switch 1,000 investment banking jobs from London to Paris. A key concern for financial firms is whether the UK will still hold passporting rights that allow British-based banks and insurers to do business in the rest of the EU. Lloyd\u2019s, the world\u2019s biggest insurance market, confirmed that it will set up a subsidiary in Brussels to allow it to continue underwriting insurance policies across the EU. The new subsidiary will have about 60 staff. Lloyd\u2019s employs 700 people in London out of global workforce of 1,000. Inga Beale, chief executive of Lloyd\u2019s, said: \u201cI am excited about the opportunities this venture will offer the market by providing that important European access efficiently. \u201cIt is now crucial that the UK government and the European Union proceed to negotiate an agreement that allows business to continue to flow under the best possible conditions once the UK formally leaves the EU. \u201cI believe it is important, not just for the City but also for Europe, that we reach a mutually beneficial agreement.\u201d The Lloyd\u2019s chairman, John Nelson, told the Financial Times he now expected other insurers to follow the market to the Belgian capital. Royal London, the insurance and pensions group, said it would be converting its existing Irish operation into a regulated subsidiary to ensure it could press ahead with work in Europe amid the uncertainty surrounding Brexit. The US investment banks JP Morgan and Citigroup sent memos to their staff confirming that they were exploring options regarding the location of their operations. JP Morgan is in talks to acquire a site in Dublin\u2019s Capital Dock from the developer Kennedy Wilson and the National Asset Management Agency, which was created by the Irish government after the financial crisis to buy property loans from banks. Jamie Dimon, chief executive of JP Morgan, said before the EU referendum last June that the bank could be forced to move as many as 4,000 jobs from the UK if the country voted to leave. JP Morgan employs about 16,000 people in the UK, with its main offices in Canary Wharf, Bournemouth and Glasgow. Citi employs almost 9,000 people in Britain. It is understood that JP Morgan has not yet made a decision about if or where it will move staff from London, but the Dublin office would be an option. In an internal memo sent to JP Morgan staff on Wednesday, Mary Erdoes, head of asset and wealth management, and Daniel Pinto, head of the firm\u2019s corporate and investment bank, said: \u201cOur size, scale and existing footprint across the continent mean that we have choices in terms of locations and legal entity structure. \u201cWe may need to make adjustments to our legal structure, but we will maintain our strong commitment to our clients in the UK and the EU. \u201cWe have spent the last several months reviewing the many variables in this process \u2013 client needs, employee considerations, regulatory requirements, operational risks, our inventory of licences, political issues in the region and dozens of other factors. This is a complex process and we will not rush into any decisions.\u201d Citi confirmed to staff that London would remain its headquarters for Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA) and an \u201cimportant global hub\u201d. However, James Cowles, Citi\u2019s chief executive for EMEA, said the bank was planning on the basis of a \u201chard Brexit\u201d that would result in the UK losing its passporting rights. Cowles said: \u201cA hard Brexit would require certain changes, including relocating certain client-facing roles to the EU from the UK, and the possible creation of a new broker-dealer entity within the EU. \u201cCiti has been discussing our options with representatives from a number of different countries, as well as with our clients.\u201d The Liberal Democrats warned that JP Morgan\u2019s potential Dublin deal and the new Brussels office for Lloyd\u2019s were a sign that jobs could be lost in the City of London due to Brexit. Susan Kramer, the Lib Dem Treasury spokeswoman, said: \u201cIt is the prime minister\u2019s choice to drive Britain out of the single market, and that is driving jobs and wealth creation out of the UK. Estimates suggest leaving the single market could cost Britain up to \u00a3200bn over 15 years. \u201cWhen the P45s start to land and the NHS operations are cancelled, this will be the government\u2019s fault.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "If Lloyd\u2019s of London is serious about banning its brokers from enjoying a pint at lunchtime, which was last month\u2019s edict from the top of the Richard Rogers building, Brussels is probably not the best place to open a new base. The beer is excellent. Still, Lloyd\u2019s Belgium-bound contingent will be few in number. The insurance market is moving \u201ca few tens\u201d of jobs from a London office that houses 700. Gags about Lloyd\u2019s of Brussels don\u2019t work, especially as the Belgian subsidiary, on day one, will employ fewer people than the Chinese one. So should we stop worrying about a mass exodus of jobs from the City? No. Lloyd\u2019s is a poor guide to the wider employment picture because its Brexit adjustment was relatively straightforward. To allow business to continue as normal, it just had to set up a separately capitalised subsidiary in the EU with its own management team. Note, too, that the non-UK EU is currently a small part of its business \u2013 about 11% of premiums. For many big banks, the calculations on jobs could be very different.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The Bank of England is considering plans to replace the animal fat in its polymer bank notes to assuage complaints from vegans and religious groups. The Bank, however, risks running straight into another row, because the most practical alternative to animal fat, it says, is palm oil \u2013 and that is likely to spark protests from environmentalists unless it can be sustainably sourced. Revelations last year that the new plastic \u00a35 note contained animal-derived additives sparked anger and boycotts, and the Bank has now launched a consultation to gauge public opinion over what materials to use for the next \u00a320 note and future reprints of the \u00a35 and \u00a310 notes. It decided earlier this year not to withdraw plastic \u00a35 banknotes from circulation and said it would push ahead with production of the new \u00a310 polymer note featuring Jane Austen, which is to be issued in September. But the Bank has postponed signing a contract for the production of the plastic \u00a320 note, which is to be issued by 2020. It has been working with De La Rue and Innovia Security, the potential suppliers of the polymer material that would be used for future bank notes, to assess alternative options to animal-based products, such as palm or coconut oil. The Bank also commissioned a report on the environmental impact of a range of additives from a consultancy firm, Efeca. On Thursday, Threadneedle Street revealed that De La Rue and Innovia had concluded that \u201cthe only practical alternative to animal-derived additives\u201d were \u201cadditives derived from palm oil\u201d and that that was \u201cconsistent with advice received from Efeca\u201d. It wants a decision on new \u00a320 notes by the summer and has called for people to give their views by 12 May. \u201cThe Bank will reflect upon the various religious, ethical and environmental considerations raised by the inclusion of animal-derived additives and palm oil as the alternative,\u201d it said, adding that it was conscious of the potential environmental costs of using palm oil. According to Efeca, it is the fourth worst agricultural product in terms of impact on global deforestation, with 8% of that between 1990 and 2008 resulting from palm oil production. In a report published on Thursday alongside its call for public views, the Bank said it had consulted WWF on using palm oil. It was told by the conservation charity that because the palm oil crop is the most efficient source of vegetable oils, \u201cit could be the least environmentally damaging source when produced sustainably\u201d. \u201cHowever, non-sustainable production of palm oil (and other vegetable-based oil crops) can lead to destruction of forests, with significant negative impacts on wildlife, as well as on the local indigenous human populations,\u201d the Bank\u2019s report added. Time for weighing up the evidence and public views is tight, because the launch of a new note can take more than four years. \u201cWhether or not to use polymer substrate produced using animal-derived additives in the new \u00a320 polymer note is therefore an urgent decision that must be taken in summer 2017 ahead of planned pre-production trials,\u201d the Bank noted. WWF said it was encouraged to see the \u201cthorough and extensive\u201d review in response to the animal fat issues, but it urged the Bank to proceed carefully if it moved to palm oil. \u201cPalm oil has benefits as it produces more oil per land area than any other equivalent oil crop,\u201d said Emma Keller, the agriculture commodities manager at WWF. \u201cWorldwide demand is expected to double again by 2050, but this expansion comes at the expense of human rights and tropical forest \u2013 which forms critical habitat for a large number of endangered wildlife [species] \u2013 unless it is sustainable. People don\u2019t want the bank notes in their pocket to come with such a high environmental cost. The Bank must only source RSPO (Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil)-certified sustainable palm oil or none at all.\u201d There was also a tentative welcome for the Bank\u2019s consultation from the Vegan Society, which campaigns for manufacturers to use plant-based products in place of animal-derived ingredients such as tallow, an animal byproduct of beef or mutton fat found in the \u00a35 notes. \u201cWhile we welcome the replacement of tallow, we encourage the Bank of England to ensure that any oils used are sourced sustainably,\u201d it said. Doug Maw, who started the petition to remove animal products from bank notes, urged people to contribute to the Bank\u2019s consultation and expressed concern about the possible use of palm oil. \u201cDuring my meeting with the chief cashier, I pointed out that, of the numerous plant-based alternatives available, palm oil or coconut oil from non-sustainable sources are also unacceptable for ethical reasons,\u201d he said. \u201cPalm production has brought the orangutang to the brink of extinction and coconuts are often harvested in a very exploitative way. I want them to consider ethical issues in all decision-making processes to avoid this kind of thing recurring.\u201d",

And it\u2019s ended with the main European markets posting small gains, with Germany\u2019s DAX hitting a new two-year high. The French CAC and Italian FTSE MIB also closed up around 0.5%. Shares in exporters were boosted by a weakening euro, which dropped after today\u2019s fall in German inflation. The FTSE 100 missed out, though, and closed down 0.06%. It was hit by a pick-up in the value of the pound, which gained half a cent to $1.249 against the US dollar. Jasper Lawler of London Capital Group sums up the session: Stocks are still in a bit of a holding pattern with traders lacking a bit of conviction to follow through on the last two days of dip-buying. A positive open in the US, helped by further recovery in crude oil prices improved sentiment in European markets by the afternoon. A bigger than expected fall in German inflation during March assured investors who have been buying the country\u2019s shares in hopes of an extended period of easy money policies. The German benchmark DAX index touched a two-year high for a second day. The resilience of the British pound in the face of Article 50 uncertainty was probably the biggest factor behind the underperformance of the FTSE 100. Fund manager Schroders was the biggest loser while Ashtead Group was top gainer. And on that note, we\u2019re closing down for the night. Thanks for reading and commenting. GW Theresa May\u2019s decision to activate Article 50 yesterday has also encouraged City firms to trigger their own contingency plans, says Joshua Mahony, market analyst at IG. He predicts short-term pain for London, as the Brexit process rumbles on. Lloyds of London\u2019s decision to relocate jobs to Brussels, coupled with rumours of potential relocations for the likes of Citi and JP Morgan do little to inspire confidence in the City of London. There is no doubt that London will be the main loser from the coming two years of negotiations, much in the same way it was the UK\u2019s main beneficiary from our EU membership. While the UK\u2019s loss may be the EU\u2019s gain in the short-term, the long-term picture of a more open, globalised UK should mean that perhaps the EU and the UK will be better off further down the line. Another investment bank, Citigroup, has told its staff that some London-based jobs will move overseas due to Britain leaving the EU. Jim Cowles, the head of Citi\u2019s Europe, Middle East and Africa division, told staff in an internal memo that planning has been underway for months. Cowles explained that Citi expects a \u201chard Brexit\u201d (ie, losing membership of the single market and the Customs Union), adding; \u201cA hard Brexit would require certain changes, including relocating certain client-facing roles to the EU from the UK, and the possible creation of a new broker-dealer entity within the EU.\u201d In another Brexity development, Luxembourg has thrown its hat into the ring to become the new home of the European Banking Authority. The EBA\u2019s responsibilities include holding the regular European-wide banking stress tests. It is currently based in London, which won\u2019t be sustainable once Britain has left the EU. Amsterdam, Dublin, Frankfurt, Paris and Vienna have all reportedly been batting their eyelashes at the EBA. The EC has suggested it could be merged with a pensions regulator, based in Germany. Luxembourg, though, claims it has a legal right to host the EBA, citing a letter from 1965 which said it would be considered as a host for financial institutions. Here\u2019s our news story about JP Morgan\u2019s plans: The Liberal Democrats are worried that JP Morgan and Lloyd\u2019s could be signalling an exodus from the City. Susan Kramer, the Lib Dem Treasury spokeswoman, says: \u201cDavid Davis has already gone back on his assurances that British firms would continue to enjoy all the benefits of single market membership in his post-Brexit utopia. Now reality is starting to intervene, with JP Morgan reportedly looking to move 1,000 jobs out of London. This follows Lloyd\u2019s of London saying it will open an office in Brussels due to Brexit and become, at least in part, Lloyd\u2019s of Brussels. \u201cIt is the prime minister\u2019s choice to drive Britain out of the single market, and that is driving jobs and wealth creation out of the UK. Estimates suggest leaving the single market could cost Britain up to \u00a3200bn over 15 years. \u201cWhen the P45s start to land and the NHS operations are cancelled, this will be the government\u2019s fault.\u201d Banks aren\u2019t the only companies considering moving jobs out of the UK after Brexit. Two fifths of computer games companies based in the UK are considering relocating out of the country, a new survey has found. The industry fears that it will lose access to international talent from the EU, and funds administered by Brussels.

The German Consumer Prices Index rose by just 1.5% annually this month, down from the four-year high of 2.2% scaled in February. Economists expected it to drop to 1.9%. That\u2019s partly because Easter fell in late March in 2016, but this year isn\u2019t until mid-April. Prices usually rise around the Easter holidays, partly due to higher transport costs. But even so, this should take some pressure off the European Central Bank to start tightening monetary policy. The overall eurozone inflation rate, announced on Friday morning, is on track to fall from last month\u2019s 2%. We mentioned earlier that Lloyd\u2019s of London is planning to shift \u201ctens of jobs\u201d to Brussels, rather than whole floors of staff from London. Reuters\u2019s George Hay has dubbed this an example of the \u201cphantom exodus\u201d, and suspects that fewer staff will leave the City than feared. He writes: There is no way to spin this outflow as a good thing. Even if every financial firm moves only 10 percent of staff, that could still risk a tangible proportion of the 71 billion pounds of tax from financial services companies generated in 2016. UBS has said a fifth of its 5,000 London staff could be affected by Brexit, while a quarter of JPMorgan\u2019s 16,000 UK staff could be. Still, anecdotally bankers at the big firms think the exodus will be less, and London will retain its financial hub status. While a free trade agreement between the EU and the UK on favourable terms for finance seems far-fetched, it\u2019s not impossible \u2013 and Prime Minister Theresa May on Wednesday said that a future free trade agreement ought to cover financial services. More simply, not many financial types want to leave London. As such, Lloyd\u2019s is merely doing what every other firm is doing \u2013 acquiring an option that it hopes will expire, out of the money. More here: Just in: A former investment banker has been fined over \u00a337,000 for sharing confidential client information over the WhatsApp messaging service. The Financial Conduct Authority imposed the penalty on Christopher Niehaus, ruling that he failed to act with \u201cdue skill, care and diligence\u201d. It explains: The FCA found that Mr Niehaus, who was a managing director in the Investment Banking division at Jefferies International Limited, received client confidential information during the course of his employment and, on a number of occasions between 24 January and 16 May 2016, shared that information with both a personal acquaintance and a friend, who was also a client of the firm. In one of the instances where Mr Niehaus shared client confidential information with his friend, who was also a client of the firm, that information was about a competitor. Mr Niehaus used the instant messaging application WhatsApp to share this information. The information was shared by Mr Niehaus because he wanted to impress the people that he shared the information with. The details of the information he shared included the identity of the client, the details relating to the client mandate and the fee Jefferies would charge for their involvement in the transaction. Mr Niehaus also boasted about how he may be able to pay off his mortgage if one of the deals was successful. None of the parties traded on the information shared, the FCA adds. Even so, Niehaus resigned from Jefferies after being suspended, after the WhatsApping came to light. More here. Bloomberg is also reporting that JPMorgan is in talks to buy office space in Dublin in response to Brexit. It believes the bank wants enough room for over 1,000 workers. It says The lender is negotiating the potential purchase of a building in Dublin\u2019s Capital Dock that\u2019s being developed by a venture between Kennedy Wilson Holdings Inc. and Ireland\u2019s National Asset Management Agency, the people said, asking not to be identified because the plans are private. The building, at 200 Capital Dock, has about 130,000 square feet (12,000 square meters) of space, the people said. That\u2019s enough for more than 1,000 workers. In another potential blow to the City, JP Morgan is reportedly considering moving hundreds of jobs to Dublin. That\u2019s according to the Irish Independent this morning, which reports: US investment banking giant JP Morgan is understood to be considering the relocation of hundreds of its employees from London to Capital Dock, the 31,600 sq m (340,000 sq ft) office scheme currently being developed by Kennedy Wilson in Dublin\u2019s docklands. News of JP Morgan\u2019s potential post-Brexit move will be welcomed, coming as it does in the wake of the decision by two major insurance companies, Lloyd\u2019s of London and AIG, to choose Brussels and Luxembourg instead of Dublin for their respective European Union bases. While a source familiar with the matter insisted that a decision on Capital Dock was \u201cstill up in the air\u201d, JP Morgan\u2019s intentions in relation to the scheme\u2019s offices are currently the subject of intense speculation within Dublin\u2019s commercial real estate sector. The Irish Independent understands that JP Morgan has been engaged in a search for space capable of accomodating employees from both its existing offices at George\u2019s Dock in Dublin\u2019s International Financial Services Centre and up to 500 personnel currently working within its London operations. Here\u2019s the full story: JP Morgan eyes Capital Dock for Brexit relocation It\u2019s no secret that JP Morgan has been considering moving staff out of the City. Before the referendum, CEO Jamie Dimon warned that up to 4,000 jobs could be lost from London if the public voted for Brexit. Today\u2019s Wall Street Journal reports that the investment bank has been weighing up the respective charms of several cities, including Paris, Frankfurt, Luxembourg and Dublin. As with Lloyd\u2019s of London, such a move would allow JP Morgan to retain those passporting rights to offer financial services within the EU (which the City will lose if Britain quits the single market). Economic confidence across the eurozone has dipped a little this month, according to the latest survey from the European Commission. The EC\u2019s index of investor and consumer sentiment in the region dipped to 107.9 this month, from 108 in February. That\u2019s weaker than expected, but still close to a five-year high. Standard &amp; Poor\u2019s isn\u2019t planning to revise Britain\u2019s credit rating, even though it has a better idea of Theresa May\u2019s Brexit strategy. S&amp;P has had Britain on a \u2018negative outlook\u2019 since June 27, the Monday after the EU referendum, when it also ripped away the country\u2019s triple-A rating. That\u2019s a sign that the rating is more likely to be cut again than raised. Moritz Kraemer, S&amp;P\u2019s chief of sovereign ratings, has told Reuters no reason to change that view, following the PM\u2019s announcement on Wednesday that Brexit has begun. Here\u2019s a flavour: Kraemer...said May\u2019s speech was largely as expected and there had been \u201cno surprises\u201d, though her tone was \u201cmore conciliatory than it could have been\u201d. \u201cThe (EU) governments know that they have to hold the (Brexit) discussions in good faith,\u201d he told Reuters. Britain\u2019s economy has proved far more resilient to uncertainty caused by the Brexit process than most economists - including those from S&amp;P - had predicted. That has raised questions as to whether the firm\u2019s negative outlook, which suggests a greater chance of another rating cut, is still justified. In Kraemer\u2019s view it is. \u201cWe have seen nothing recently to make us rethink the negative outlook on the UK rating,\u201d he said. More here: No reason to rethink UK rating\u2019s negative outlook: S&amp;P There\u2019s not much drama in the foreign exchange market either. Sterling is hovering around the $1.241 level, a dip of 0.2% today, and slightly below its level before Britain formally triggered Article 50. It\u2019s up slightly against the euro at \u20ac1.156, meaning one euro is worth 86.5p. Yann Quelenn, market analyst at Swissquote, the Switzerland bank, believes sterling might actually rally this year as the Brexit talks proceed. Losing 20% in the wake of the referendum vote, the weaker sterling has provided the UK with a strong exports boost. Strengthening of the pound is now very likely especially as Europe faces a veritable minefield with the upcoming French and German elections. Time to reload GBP. [Great British Pounds] Britain\u2019s Brexit secretary, David Davis, is touring the broadcasting studios this morning. He\u2019s denying that the UK is blackmailing Europe by using security co-operation as a bargaining chip, and trying to play down the idea of a huge exit bill. Andy Sparrow\u2019s Politics Live blog has all the details: You might have expected European financial markets to be rattled by the formal opening of the Brexit process. But no. Trading is extremely sluggish across the continent\u2019s stock exchanges this morning. The Stoxx 600, which tracks the 600 largest companies in the region, has crept up by a mere 0.09%. In London, the FTSE 100 is up a meagre 5 points. But this soporific mood probably won\u2019t last, once the UK actually begins the tussle with the rest of the EU. Connor Campbell of SpreadEx warns: The European markets are looking pretty sleepy this morning, lacking the direction provided by the Trump slump and Article 50 earlier in the week. However, with the real Brexit negotiations looming these kinds of placid opens may soon be a distant memory. Kit Juckes of Societe Generale also spies trouble ahead: In the UK dawn has broken over the new post-Article 50 environment. A beautiful red sunrise greeted me as I arrived at work, warning of rain even as the weather forecasters promise me the warmest day of the year so far. The bickering has already started over the order in which the exit can be negotiated and the uncertainty about the economic impact isn\u2019t going away. Now this is interesting.... Inga Beale, Lloyd\u2019s CEO, has revealed that they chose Brussels partly because Belgium is unlikely to follow Britain out of the EU. Speaking on BBC News, Beale said the group wanted a location with strong regulation, and good access to talent, which could be reached easily from London and other parts of Europe. Lloyd\u2019s also wanted to think about the likelyhood of the country remaining in the EU too, Beale explained. She added that it would be \u201cfantastic\u201d if Britain negotiated a deal that meant City firms retained their passporting rights in Europe [allowing them to sell services to every country in the EU from one site]. But as that now seems unlikely, Lloyd\u2019s is pressing on with the move to Brussels. Lloyd\u2019s of London chairman John Nelson has said the new Brussels operation will employ \u201ctens\u201d of staff; a mixture of new hires and existing workers who will transfer to Belgium. He adds that it\u2019s \u201ctoo early to say\u201d whether other insurers will make a similar move, but points out that other Lloyd\u2019s hubs have created their own ecosystems. So we might find that some of Lloyd\u2019s customers - the insurance brokers who trade on its market - shift jobs to Brussels too. (thanks to Reuters for the quotes). Lloyd\u2019s decision to open a new EU hub in Brussels is causing a stir. Bloomberg points out that other companies will be considering similar action: British companies and international financial firms are considering how to continue serving European clients should the U.K. withdraw not just from the EU, but also from its single market and customs union, both of which can accommodate countries that aren\u2019t in the bloc. The BBC\u2019s Simon Jack reckons Downing Street won\u2019t appreciate the move, even though Lloyd\u2019s is also maintaining its main headquarters in London. Paul Sommerville of Sommerville Advisory Markets wonders if a name change might be needed: That didn\u2019t take long. Just a day after Britain triggered article 50, one of the City\u2019s most established names announced plans to open a new office in Brussels. Lloyd\u2019s of London, the insurance market that famously began in a coffee house, will create a subsidiary in the Belgian capital so it can retain its \u2018passporting rights\u2019 in Europe. Those rights are essential to keep offering financial services across the EU from. Under the plan, Lloyd\u2019s will have its new office ready in time for the 2019 underwriting season -- to minimise the disruption from Brexit. Up to 100 staff are likely to move. CEO Inga Beale says it will provide \u2018efficient\u2019 access to Europe, adding: \u201cIt is now crucial that the UK government and the European Union proceed to negotiate an agreement that allows business to continue to flow under the best possible conditions once the UK formally leaves the EU. I believe it is important not just for the City but also for Europe that we reach a mutually beneficial agreement.\u201d Here\u2019s Julia Kollewe\u2019s news story on the announcement, and Lloyd\u2019s latest financial results: Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. The City feels rather subdued this morning after the drama of seeing Britain hit the exit button to quit the European Union yesterday. Traders are watching to see how the opening exchanges pan out...and there are already worrying signs, with EU officials unhappy that the UK is threatening that security co-operation will suffer unless it gets a decent deal. Investors may also be alarmed that the two side are also at odds, already, over the negotiating process. Britain wants to discuss the terms of the divorce, and the future relationship, at the same time - but Germany insists the exit bill is agreed first. So faced with this impasse, investors are taking a cautious approach this morning. And that means the pound is serenely flat in early trading, at $1.243 against the US dollar. It\u2019s equally unruffled against the euro, at \u20ac1.1551 - the same as last night. Equities are calm too, with the FTSE 100 gaining 8 points in early trading, to 7382 points. No drama here (yet anyway). FXTM chief market strategist Hussein Sayed believes Brexit will be a tricky event for the City. Traders haven\u2019t seen such a historic event before, and Wednesday marked the official countdown of UK\u2019s divorce from the EU, ending a 44-year relationship with its neighbors. The end of this relationship is of course painful, but many agree that this marriage was not a case of love at first sight after all. Investors decided not to take any significant action on Wednesday, the GBP-USD traded within 70 pips trading range, and all major European equity markets closed higher. Predicting currency movements was never an easy task, and in the pound\u2019s case it\u2019s even a more complicated situation given that we never experienced such a divorce in the past. Economic conditions in the U.K. are in a much better shape than what was anticipated nine months ago, with most economic indicators surprising to the upside. Meanwhile, the BoE is likely to turn more hawkish as the depreciation of sterling continues to feed through to increased prices. These factors helped the pound to find a floor in the past 6-months, but the forward outlook will much depend on how negotiations progress in the next couple of months. Coming up this morning. There\u2019s some interesting economic data on the calendar today, which might move the markets. 10am BST: The latest Eurozone economic confidence reading; expected to be a little higher this month as the European economy picks up 1pm BST: German inflation figures for March.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The boss of one of Britain\u2019s biggest energy companies has hit out at the prospect of a price cap on bills after Theresa May promised to step in to fix a market that is \u201cmanifestly not working for all consumers\u201d. Alistair Phillips-Davies, chief executive of SSE, said that it was disappointing that the retail energy market was still facing intervention having just undergone an 18-month investigation by the competition watchdog. He added that it would be a shame if competition was damaged by a cap on standard tariffs, as some campaigners and politicians have been calling for after a recent spate of price hikes by energy suppliers. SSE, which has 8.08 million customers, had no choice over its decision to raise electricity prices by 15% as it would have lost money if it had not acted, Phillips-Davies said. On Wednesday the company said its dividend cover would keep pace with inflation in coming years but warned it would be at the low end of expectations in 2017/18 due of lower profits in its network division and the low price secured for providing standby power next winter. Analysts at RBC said the company\u2019s share price was likely to remain under pressure until there was clarity over any government intervention next month. Speaking on the sidelines of a conference in London, Phillips-Davies said: \u201cWe don\u2019t know what government is going to do or say, we will obviously engage constructively with whatever they want to do. \u201cGiven the time it\u2019s taken them to think about whatever they want to do they\u2019re obviously being thoughtful. It\u2019s probably slightly disappointing the CMA [Competition and Markets Authority, and its review] has not brought an end to where we stand in the market, but we need to get to the right place.\u201d On the possibility of a price cap being imposed, he said: \u201cIf we no longer have the benefits of competition, if they\u2019re consigned to history for a time, that seems a shame.\u201d Phillips-Davies added that regulating prices could have \u201cunintended consequences like killing competition\u201d. His comments coincide with new statistics that show SSE and other energy companies have only installed smart meters in 10% of British homes, suggesting at current rates they will miss the government target of 100% by the end of 2020. The head of the unit that looks after British Gas\u2019s 22 million domestic customers said the speed of progress showed energy companies needed to do a better job of promoting the meters, which eliminate the need for manual readings. \u201cThe challenge on increasing penetration rate of smart meters, it is not about whether we have enough on the supply side in terms of installation engineers,\u201d said Sarwjit Sambi, managing director of UK home at Centrica. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to do a much much better job of demonstrating benefits of having a smart meter to customers.\u201d The company delivering the network that supports smart meters said the rollout was a huge task for energy suppliers. \u201cIt\u2019s a massive challenge for the industry to move from today ... to the end of 2020,\u201d said Matt Roderick, chief technology officer at the Data Communications Company, speaking at the Future of Utilities conference in London. The Liberal Democrats said efforts should be stepped up to accelerate the roll-out and increase awareness of smart meters. Lynne Featherstone, the party\u2019s energy and climate change spokesperson, said: \u201cAt this rate, the government will dismally fail to meet its target of ensuring every home has a smart meter by 2020.\u201d",

    "webTitle": "Lloyd's of London plans to open Brussels office by middle of 2018", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Lloyd\u2019s of London aims to have a new Brussels office up and running by the middle of next year, after the insurance market failed in its efforts to secure \u201cpassporting\u201d rights for financial companies to conduct business across the EU after Brexit. The world\u2019s biggest insurance market confirmed on Thursday it would set up a subsidiary in the Belgian capital, which would allow it to continue underwriting insurance policies from all 27 EU and three EEA states after the UK leaves the union. Lloyd\u2019s has been lobbying the UK government to guarantee passporting rights, which allow UK banks and insurers to do business in the rest of the EU, but felt that \u201cthe chances are lower than they were\u201d and decided it could wait no longer. Inga Beale, the Lloyd\u2019s chief executive, said this would ensure that business can carry on without interruption when the UK leaves the EU. The move, which was announced alongside the group\u2019s annual results, came a day after Theresa May triggered article 50 to kickstart the two-year process of leaving the EU. Beale said Lloyd\u2019s had plumped for Brussels because of its \u201creally robust reputation for regulation\u201d, access to multilingual talent and the ease of travelling there from London. Another factor was the likelihood Belgium will remain in the EU \u2013 which was one of the factors that counted against Paris, she said. The new subsidiary will have its own board and employ about 60 staff initially, including people already working in Germany and Italy. About 10 to 20 staff will be based in Brussels at the start, including the chief executive of the new business. Beale said the \u201codd job\u201d might move from London \u2013 for example, people who have European roles. Beale explained that because it took time to set up a new company and many commercial insurance policies were renewed at the start of January, Lloyd\u2019s had to act now to ensure its Brussels subsidiary was up and running by the middle of next year. But if passporting rights were guaranteed, \u201cwe would not require an EU subsidiary\u201d, she said. It would also benefit EU firms doing business in Britain. She warned that though the UK was expected to leave the EU in two years, there would be \u201cyears and years of negotiations and planning to do\u201d. Lloyd\u2019s employs about 700 people in London out of global workforce of 1,000. Beale said Lloyd\u2019s had picked Brussels out of a long list of options that included Dublin and Malta, and stressed that it was \u201cnot a simple decision\u201d. The Belgian capital trumped Luxembourg, where a number of global insurers have a presence, because Brussels has a bigger domestic insurance market, among other things. But she did not expect Brussels to become a specialist centre for insurance \u2013 London will retain that crown. Special tax deals did not play a role in the insurance market\u2019s decision, she added, saying: \u201cTax wasn\u2019t one of the key factors.\u201d At Lloyd\u2019s, 11% of premiums are with EU clients, but only half of that \u2013 about \u00a31.5bn \u2013 is at risk from Brexit. Only simple insurance products will be affected, but not big reinsurance contracts and specialist insurance such as marine and aviation, Beale said. Other UK insurers are preparing to shift operations to continental Europe. \u201cSome will go to Dublin and Luxembourg, some may even go to Malta,\u201d Beale said. Royal London Mutual Insurance Society will turn its Irish business into a regulated subsidiary so it can continue to sell products across Europe after the UK loses access to the single market, its chief executive, Phil Loney, said on Thursday. AIG, the US insurance company, announced this month that it would set up a subsidiary in Luxembourg, where it currently has a branch. Goldman Sachs is to move move hundreds of bankers to Frankfurt and Paris, while HSBC wants to switch 1,000 investment banking jobs from London to the French capital. Beale stressed it was crucial for the UK and the EU to \u201cnegotiate an agreement that allows business to continue to flow under the best possible conditions once the UK formally leaves the EU\u201d.

The move, which was announced alongside the group\u2019s annual results, came a day after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/mar/29/theresa-may-triggers-article-50-with-warning-of-consequences-for-uk\">Theresa May triggered article 50</a> to kickstart the two-year process of leaving the EU.</p> <p>Beale said Lloyd\u2019s had plumped for Brussels because of its \u201creally robust reputation for regulation\u201d, access to multilingual talent and the ease of travelling there from London. Another factor was the likelihood Belgium will remain in the EU \u2013 which was one of the factors that counted against Paris, she said.</p> <p>The new subsidiary will have its own board and employ about 60 staff initially, including people already working in Germany and Italy. About 10 to 20 staff will be based in Brussels at the start, including the chief executive of the new business. Beale said the \u201codd job\u201d might move from London \u2013 for example, people who have European roles.</p> <p>Beale explained that because it took time to set up a new company and many commercial insurance policies were renewed at the start of January, Lloyd\u2019s had to act now to ensure its Brussels subsidiary was up and running by the middle of next year. But if passporting rights were guaranteed, \u201cwe would not require an EU subsidiary\u201d, she said. It would also benefit EU firms doing business in Britain.<br></p> <p>She warned that though the UK was expected to leave the EU in two years, there would be \u201cyears and years of negotiations and planning to do\u201d.</p> <p>Lloyd\u2019s employs about 700 people in London out of global workforce of 1,000. </p> <p>Beale said Lloyd\u2019s had picked Brussels out of a long list of options that included Dublin and Malta, and stressed that it was \u201cnot a simple decision\u201d. The Belgian capital trumped Luxembourg, where a number of global insurers have a presence, because Brussels has a bigger domestic insurance market, among other things. But she did not expect Brussels to become a specialist centre for insurance \u2013 London will retain that crown.</p> <p>Special tax deals did not play a role in the insurance market\u2019s decision, she added, saying: \u201cTax wasn\u2019t one of the key factors.\u201d</p> <p>At Lloyd\u2019s, 11% of premiums are with EU clients, but only half of that \u2013 about \u00a31.5bn \u2013 is at risk from Brexit. Only simple insurance products will be affected, but not big reinsurance contracts and specialist insurance such as marine and aviation, Beale said. </p> <p>Other UK insurers are preparing to shift operations to continental Europe. \u201cSome will go to Dublin and Luxembourg, some may even go to Malta,\u201d Beale said.</p> <p>Royal London Mutual Insurance Society will turn its Irish business into a regulated subsidiary so it can continue to sell products across Europe after the UK loses access to the single market, its chief executive, Phil Loney, said on Thursday.</p> <p>AIG, the US insurance company, announced this month that it would set up a subsidiary in Luxembourg, where it currently has a branch.

Booker, which supplies 125,000 UK convenience stores, said tobacco sales dropped by 7.5% on a like-for-like basis in the three months to 24 March, while non-tobacco sales were up by 4.7%. Overall, like-for-like sales rose by 0.7%. A ban on displaying tobacco products at the point of sale was extended from larger outlets to small stores in the UK in April 2015. From May, smokers will not be able to buy rolling tobacco or packets of 10 cigarettes. Menthol cigarettes will be phased out and packets will be plain, with graphic images to illustrate the impact smoking has on health. Some flavoured cigarettes such as vanilla or fruit will also be banned. Booker made sales of \u00a35.3bn in the year to 24 March, up 6.7% from the previous year. Like-for-like tobacco sales fell 4.6%. The Booker chief executive, Charles Wilson, said: \u201cOverall, 2016-17 was a good year. Customer satisfaction was good and sales were the best we have ever achieved.\u201d Commenting on the Tesco deal, Wilson said he was \u201cexcited about the benefits the enlarged group will bring to consumers, our customers, suppliers, colleagues and shareholders\u201d. He said it was \u201cbusiness as usual\u201d while the deal was going through the competition process. However, Tesco\u2019s takeover of the company has been thrown into doubt after two major shareholders in the supermarket group wrote to its chairman to voice their opposition to the deal. This month 34 Budgens convenience stores, about a fifth of the chain, closed with the loss of more than 800 jobs, after administrators failed to find a buyer. The rest of the Budgens business, which is run by independent operators, was unaffected.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Poundland is to put value fashion into more than 100 stores by the end of the year as it tries to step into the gap on the high street once filled by Woolworths. The chain, which was bought by the South African group Steinhoff International for \u00a3610m in September, expects to put Pep&amp;Co clothing outlets in up to 200 of its 850 stores over the longer term. Pep&amp;Co is also also owned by Steinhoff. The introduction of clothing into Poundland is part of a broader strategy to sell items priced more than \u00a31. A small range of low-price clothing items, such as socks, leggings and babygrows will also be available in 577 Poundland stores by the end of April. Andy Bond, the former Asda boss who heads the European arm of Steinhoff, said: \u201cWe are putting clothing into big Poundlands. We are bringing back to high streets the kind of clothing that was once loved.\u201d He said many of the stores had been Woolworths or Marks &amp; Spencer outlets. Pep&amp;Co was founded by Bond, who once ran Asda\u2019s George clothing label, with backing from the South African tycoon and Steinhoff shareholder Christo Wiese. The first shop opened in Kettering, Northamptonshire, in July 2015 and the chain opened its first 50 stores in less than two months. It now has nearly 60 standalone stores and nearly 30 outlets in Poundland as well as six in GHM! outlets, a discount chain also launched by Bond that is now being folded into Poundland. There will be 103 Poundland Pep&amp;Cos by the autumn, taking the total Pep&amp;Co chain to about 170 outlets in less than three years. Adrian Mountford, managing director of Pep&amp;Co, said the brand was struggling to restock womenswear to keep up with demand. \u201cWe\u2019re absolutely delighted,\u201d he said. He said the chain was likely to be taking market share from rivals such as George and Peacocks because it was more than 25% cheaper. Mountford said the massive increase in the volume of clothing Pep&amp;Co was now buying from suppliers meant it had been able to offset rising costs as a result of the fall in the value of the pound. Less than 4% of Poundland\u2019s sales are currently above \u00a31 and the company wants to expand that with deals on non-clothing items at \u00a32 or \u00a35, but the retailer said more than 90% of the chain\u2019s range would always be sold at \u00a31. Bond added that the higher price points were intended to enable Poundland to move into new product areas such as bedding and toys that were difficult to sell for \u00a31. \u201cThis is not to shuffle in inflation but about new items,\u201d he said. Barry Williams, the former Asda director who joined Poundland as trading director in November, said: \u201cInflation is running through the industry as we speak and it is a massive concern for our customers. For us it\u2019s really simple. We are committed to the pound.\u201d Williams said Poundland would also be fighting against so-called \u201cshrinkflation\u201d \u2013 in which prices were held while products dropped in size \u2013 by cutting costs, pushing for better deals with suppliers and replacing third party brands with own label. The retailer has already dropped After Eights in favour of its own Mint Nights and Cadbury\u2019s Egg \u2018n\u2019 Spoon chocolate eggs in favour the own-label Spoon it Out. Bond said: \u201cWe have got a lot of opportunity to take cost out of our business and doing so allows us to invest in our product offer and not make shortcuts for customers in either size or quality.\u201d He said shrinkflation would be \u201cvery much the exception rather than the rule\u201d. He admitted, however, that the group might have to accept lower profit margins by the end of the year as it fought to keep inflation off the shop floor. Since taking over Poundland, the new management team has sold off unwanted stock and cut unprofitable stores. This week it put the remainder of its 99p Stores business, which was taken over by Poundland in late 2015, into administration and offloading 60 stores, most of which had already closed. About 170 99p outlets have been converted to Poundland since the takeover. About 13 of the outlets put into administration this week will controversially be taken back and converted by Poundland in future. The business also runs the Dealz chain in Ireland and Spain. The future of its Spanish chain, which has just 11 outlets, is currently under review.",

The retailer has already dropped After Eights in favour of its own Mint Nights and Cadbury\u2019s Egg \u2018n\u2019 Spoon chocolate eggs in favour the own-label Spoon it Out.</p> <p>Bond said: \u201cWe have got a lot of opportunity to take cost out of our business and doing so allows us to invest in our product offer and not make shortcuts for customers in either size or quality.\u201d He said shrinkflation would be \u201cvery much the exception rather than the rule\u201d.</p> <p>He admitted, however, that the group might have to accept lower profit margins by the end of the year as it fought to keep inflation off the shop floor.</p> <p>Since taking over Poundland, the new management team has sold off unwanted stock and cut unprofitable stores. This week it put the remainder of its 99p Stores business, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/feb/06/poundand-buys-rival-99p-stores\">which was taken over by Poundland in late 2015</a>, into administration and offloading 60 stores, most of which had already closed. About 170 99p outlets have been converted to Poundland since the takeover. About 13 of the outlets put into administration this week will controversially be taken back and converted by Poundland in future.</p> <p>The business also runs the Dealz chain in Ireland and Spain. The future of its Spanish chain, which has just 11 outlets, is currently under review.</p>",
