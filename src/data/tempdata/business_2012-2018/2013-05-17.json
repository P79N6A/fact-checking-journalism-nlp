Platts, which is based in New York and owned by US publisher McGraw-Hill, said transparency and independence were the key to robust energy benchmarks and said they should be free from \"undue influence, including from public institutions\". The agency was responding to a consultation document put out last year by the International Organisation of Securities Commissions (Iosco) and its response was published by the body two months ago. \"Platts believes that benchmark submissions should not be a regulated activity and that any perceived benefits would be far outweighed by the significant disadvantages of doing so,\" it said, using exactly the same wording to argue in the same letter against a similar move to regulate benchmark administration. \"By raising the regulatory burden on data reporting activity, such action would likely cause a retreat from participation in price discovery processes in general.

Statoil, the Norwegian oil and gas group which was raided along with BP and Shell, admitted the suspected violations being looked at by Brussels may have been going on since 2002. In a statement, the EC said: \"The Commission has concerns that the companies may have colluded in reporting distorted prices to a Price Reporting Agency to manipulate the published prices for a number of oil and biofuel products.\" The EC said none of the companies raided should be considered guilty at this stage but analysts said it was not good for reputations, not least BP, which sacked some of its traders and paid a $300m fine in the US after the Commodity Futures Trading Commission accused it in 2006 of trying to manipulate the propane gas market.

Ian Gordon, banks analyst at Investec, said the share sell-off could begin this year. \"Having missed the chance to sell some of its stake in September 2010 when the shares peaked at 77p \u2013 and subsequently collapsed to 21p by November 2011, it would be prudent to commence a disposal without delay,\" said Gordon. \"The government investment was \u00a320.3bn, and, given current frothy market conditions, I believe it would be entirely credible to look to place, say, an initial \u00a32bn tranche.\" The chancellor has yet to outline any specific strategy to dispose of the Lloyds stake \u2013 or the 81% holding in Royal Bank of Scotland, whose shares were the biggest riser in the FTSE 100 on Friday with a 5% jump to 336p. A Treasury spokesperson said: \"The government will return Lloyds Banking Group fully to the private sector when it is in the interests of the taxpayer to do so.\" The 61p figure is based on the price that Lloyds shares were trading at on the day the government bought its stakes, rather than the actual price paid. The equivalent price for RBS is 407p, compared with the 502p actually paid for the shares.",

      "bodyText": "For Ocado, the deal with Morrisons stacks up beautifully on day one. When the online specialist opened its second huge distribution centre in Dordon, Warwickshire, in February the worry was that it would take ages to fill a warehouse capable of handling \u00a31bn of sales a year. Now there's a quickish solution: half the space will be devoted to Morrisons' new online business. The financial terms for Ocado also look smart. By selling Dordon to Morrisons for \u00a3170m and leasing it back, Ocado will be transformed from a company with net debt to one with a handsome cash balance. It will also get a string of other payments from IT licence fees to a quarter-share of any operating profits from Morrisons.com for the next 15 years. Neat. Morrisons was clearly desperate to deal. For a decade, the Bradford-based firm has sat smugly outside an online party where no supermarket seems to be making a hard bottom-line profit at \u00a35 delivery charges. Chief executive Dalton Philips has finally had to concede that he is losing customers and that there is a risk in not dancing. Everybody happy? Mark Price, boss of Waitrose, is not. He has summoned a QC and wants to see the small print. Fair enough, since Ocado is a business built on its sourcing agreement with Waitrose and the relationship is supposed to be mutually beneficial. But was it also meant to be monogamous? That's the issue. The Ocado folk are no mugs. It would be astonishing if there has been a breach of contract. Instead, a breakdown in the long-term relationship between Waitrose and Ocado is the way to bet. In one sense, that would be a continuation of the established story. The John Lewis Partnership's pension fund sold its entire shareholding soon after Ocado's flotation in 2010. Waitrose has been free to compete with Ocado since 2011 \u2013 and is doing so. The best policy for Price, if he remains peeved, is to redouble his efforts to recruit Ocado customers to Waitrose ways. If he succeeds, he'll have a stronger hand to exercise the break clause with Ocado in 2017. If that happens, Ocado and Morrisons would be pushed into a closer embrace. The fact that their agreement runs for 25 years suggests they're already planning that way. Dear government, your new proposed high-speed railway is an economic turkey. Every time the numbers are updated or corrected, the cost/benefit advantage becomes smaller. Some of the data in your model is 10 years out of date. And the claim that the north-south divide would be closed is unproven. Of course, the National Audit Office didn't actually call HS2 a turkey. It prefers phrases like \"the strategic case should be better developed at this stage\". But, if a company were proposing a project with the economic characteristics of HS2, the shareholders would be in uproar. They would demand the immediate scrapping of the plans and a new board of directors. Alarm bells sound when you see how far the Department for Transport's claimed benefits of the project have shrunk. Back in 2010, the numbers suggested \u00a32.60 of benefits for every \u00a31 spent to build phase one, the line between London and Birmingham. Now we're down to \u00a31.40 and this figure relies heavily on the calculation that the gain from carrying business travellers at faster speeds is \u00a312.6bn. The figure is questionable, to put it mildly. \"The department's methodology uses a simplifying assumption that time spent travelling is unproductive,\" says the NAO. In other words, the assumption is that business folk do not work on trains. In the age of the internet and 4G telephony, that's nonsense. The NAO report is merely an analysis of the programme as presented. The main objection to HS2 is simpler: there are more productive ways to spend \u00a335bn on transport. Almost every study, from the Eddington report of 2006 onwards, says so. How about ensuring the M62 doesn't become a daily traffic jam? That would be a surer way to boost growth in the north than building a faster railway to the capital. There are other smaller ideas, both road and rail, that could be adopted. HS2 is a luxury, dreamed up in an era of imagined plenty. It should be scrapped and the \u00a335bn spent on transport projects with superior economics. Sir Stelios Haji-Ioannou ought to be delighted. The founder of easyJet has achieved a lot in his five years of agitation from the outside. He's got a brand licensing deal worth about \u00a310m a year to his easyGroup. After campaigning for easyJet to pay a dividend, the prize appeared in 2011. It amounts to about \u00a340m a year to him, his brother and his sister, who own 37% of easyJet between them. He has also seen Mike Rake, his bete noire, depart as chairman this month. Best of all, easyJet's share price has trebled since the start of 2012. The Haji-Ioannou family's stake is now worth a cool \u00a31.75bn. Is he happy? Only up to a point. \"Good things happen to airlines that do not order more aircraft,\" he said this week as easyJet unveiled its latest strong numbers, which, as he says, owe much to the airline's ability to charge higher ticket prices in an industry that isn't adding capacity. Then came the inevitable warning to the board: \"All this good work could be undone by the vanity exercise of buying new aircraft.\" A showdown seems likely. Chief executive Carolyn McCall (formerly of this parish: she was chief executive of Guardian Media Group) appears to be warming up her shareholders for a sizeable order. The City expects 100 aircraft, with the bulk to be used to replace existing planes in the 210-strong fleet. Sir Stelios would be furious. But what would he do? Remember what he said in January when he and his siblings each sold a \"token\" (his word) 200,000 shares to send a clear message to the directors: \"If they place such an order now I will be looking to dispose of more of my stake before this happens.\" If he was serious about selling before the supposedly dreadful day, make-your-mind-up time is close. McCall has said the board is in the final stages of evaluating the new aircraft question. In Sir Stelios' shoes, you might also be staring at that share price and wondering whether there'll ever be a better opportunity to diversify the family's investment portfolio. The stock market is in bullish mood and easyJet is riding high. If he wanted to slip, say, a quarter of his stake on to the market, the moment is ripe. On his way out, he could legitimately declare his unique style of activism to be a triumph. It's a hunch. We shall see. Harriet Green reminded us this week that she has been chief executive of Thomas Cook for 41 weeks and that the firm's \"decisive and rapid\" action is \"already delivering results.\" That's unarguable. Thomas Cook is not just back from the brink \u2013 it's in the game again. A cost-cutting plan is proceeding at full speed, a successful \u00a31.6bn refinancing was unveiled on Thursday and the share price has recovered from 16p to 158p. Green stands to make a fortune. Her package on arrival from distrbutor Premier Farnell comprised 6.2m shares. These are now worth almost \u00a310m \u2013 call it \u00a3250,000 a week for her 41 weeks so far. She still has to clear the three-year performance hurdles, but that now looks a formality. Is she worth it? If the yardstick is the \u00a315m received by former boss Manny Fontenla-Novoa during five years that ended in a share price calamity, the answer is yes.",

The European Banking Authority, which sets the rules for banks in the 27 European Union countries, is thought to have approved proposals that would require a cap on bonuses for anyone whose pay is more than \u20ac500,000 (\u00a3420,000). It is the latest proposed addition to the law published in March that will require bonuses for certain bank staff in the EU to be capped at 100% of their salary \u2013 or at 200% if shareholders give their approval. The proposals, expected to be published early next week, would mark the first time a remuneration level had been published to define who are the \"material risk takers\" who will be subject to the bonus cap. In general, banks have been able to make their own calculations as to whom they regarded as the risk takers in the organisation. \"This expansion of the definition of risk takers will see substantially more individuals working in the banking industry being hit by tougher pay rules, including being subject to bonus caps from next year,\" said Jon Terry, a partner at accountants PwC. \"If the proposals are implemented as proposed, this will mean anyone earning over \u20ac500,000 will be deemed a risk taker irrespective of their role or impact on the risk of the firm,\" he said. \"This will significantly increase the number of employees subject to the bonus capping, to perhaps as much as ten times for some investment banks operating in London.\" Barclays, which has provided a more detailed breakdown than any other bank of staff pay in 2012, paid some 1,338 people more than \u00a3500,000 \u2013 although this included bonuses. It described 393 as \"code staff\", meaning those regarded as taking or monitoring risk. The chancellor, George Osborne, had attempted to head off the bonus cap when it was discussed in March for fear that it would damage the City.

Pappas was the focus of another parliamentary furore earlier this week when it was exposed that he had openly praised the Fuhrer in a piece written for Golden Dawn\u2019s magazine years ago. </p> <p>The incident does not bode well \u2013 even if this is not the first time a Golden Dawn MP has caused commotion in the House. With the party now able to take the moral high-ground, many worry the episode could stoke further the flames of support for the far right group shown in the latest poll to be published today as firmly entrenching its position as Greece\u2019s third major party with 11.5%t.</p> <p>On Thursday.

Within the current macroeconomic framework, the gaps are currently estimated at about 1.7% of GDP in 2015 and 2.1% of GDP in 2016.

Let me be blunt: it has had governance shortcomings, stretched states, fragile banks, shrinking economies, sinking confidence in institutions and doubts about its integrity. Each of these difficulties has exacerbated the others; it has been a vicious circle. The crisis did not originate in the euro area, nor is it limited to it. But inside the euro area it has inflicted severe losses and pain, particularly on the younger generation</p> </blockquote> <p>Mersch also fleshed out the challenge facing national governments:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>In most of the stressed euro area countries this still requires tough choices across the generations and over time: e.g. education versus pension entitlements, infrastructure versus healthcare, research and development versus defence, and so on.</p> <p>Strengthening of tax administrations and treasury systems, expenditure control, privatisation will also be crucial. Reducing the costs of bureaucracy will matter more than ever across the euro area.</p> <p>There are varying needs for true innovation clusters \u00e0-la-Silicon Valley, as well as investments in scientific and technical education, research and development, encouragement of \u201cangel investments\u201d, and grassroots and sustainable banking.</p> <p>Labour markets need to become inclusive and fair in every country, while encouraging labour mobility, in particular in a monetary union.

      "bodyText": "Crisis-hit Cyprus could be headed for a much worse recession than initially anticipated when international creditors agreed to prop up its economy, the IMF has announced in a 47-page report released today. Helena Smith writes: Forecasting that the island\u2019s output will shrink by at least 9% in 2013 (and perhaps even more) the IMF said Cyprus faced \u201cunusually high\u201d macro-economic risks if it did not adhere to the stringent terms of the \u20ac13bn bailout it has signed with the EU, ECB and IMF. \"Should these risks materialize, additional financing measures may be needed to preserve debt sustainability,\" it said, predicting that the tiny nation\u2019s debt load would hit 126% of gross domestic product in 2015 before falling to 105% of GDP by 2020. Despite having already agreed to draconian belt-tightening measures \u2013 including highly controversial capital capitals \u2013 it was likely that Nicosia would be required to further slash GDP by 4.7% a year (the equivalent of \u20ac900m worth of budget cuts) over 2015 to 2018 to secure the island\u2019s long-term primary budget surplus, said the IMF. With the ink on the loan agreement barely dry, the report has unleashed fury among politicians on the island with the anti-austerity main opposition Akel party not only slamming the bailout deal but questioning if the government had read it before it signed up to the agreement. Akel cadres say the IMF assessment will embolden those now openly asking if it would not be better for the beleaguered island to exit the eurozone than apply such tough conditions. And on that note, it's time to shut up shop for the evening and for the week. Thanks for all your comments, and we'll be back next week. Here's the full statement on the EFSF payments to Greece. As IfigEusLannuon rightly points out below the payments are loans not aid and have to be paid back. Slovenia has seen its debt rating cut by Fitch, the agency has just announced. Last month Moody's reduced its rating on the country to junk, from Ba1 to Baa2. Now Fitch has cut from A- to BBB+ with a negative outlook. It said the economic outlook had deteriorated and it now forecast a 2% decline in GDP in 2013. It predicts a 0.3% decline in 2014, leaving it as only one of two eurozone countries to contract. The agency said its estimates of the cost of bank recapitalisation were higher than official forecasts. It estimated the sector needed an injection of \u20ac2.8bn, with \u20ac2bn needed for the three largest banks. This is more than double the official estimate. European car sale figures and the positive US consumer sentiment data have combined to keep markets moving higher. \u2022 The FTSE 100 finished 35.26 points higher at 6723.06 \u2022 Germany's Dax rose 28.13 points to 8398.00 \u2022 France's Cac climbed 22.20 points to 4001.27 \u2022 Italy's FTSE MIB added 60.6 points to 17,604.61 \u2022 Spain's Ibex was up 40.1 points at 8582.4 \u2022 The Athens market added 1.62% to 1152.6 And in the US, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently around 60 points or 0.,4% higher. Still with Greece, the ESFS bailout fund has said the country will receive \u20ac4.2bn of the next tranche of \u20ac7.2bn aid. That takes the total aid so far to \u20ac120bn. The next payment will be made in June. More on this morning's ejection of a far-right MP from the Greek parliament, which has sent political tensions soaring. Helena Smith writes: Predictably, the extreme right Golden Dawn party was quick to roll out an announcement following the removal of its MP, Panayiotis Iliopoulos, from the 300-seat House. Railing against the \u201cfilthy slanderous attack of the entire media against Golden Dawn\u201d it denied than any of its MPs had shouted \u201cHeil Hitler\u201d during the heated exchange in the chamber, [see earlier post]. \u201cThe controversial and provocative phrase was uttered by Syriza\u2019s MP from Zakynthos, Stavros Kontonis,\u201d it insisted. \u201cWe demand from the parrots of the system who have linked Golden Dawn with this particular phrase to revoke [their stance] immediately, otherwise they will suffer the legal effects [that come with] dissemination of false news and slanderous defamation.\u201d Hours later, minutes taken during the session revealed the offending phrase had been uttered not by the neo-Nazi party\u2019s spokesman, Christos Pappas, as initially believed, but Christos Panztas, an MP with the far-left Syriza, the country\u2019s main opposition party. Pappas was the focus of another parliamentary furore earlier this week when it was exposed that he had openly praised the Fuhrer in a piece written for Golden Dawn\u2019s magazine years ago. The incident does not bode well \u2013 even if this is not the first time a Golden Dawn MP has caused commotion in the House. With the party now able to take the moral high-ground, many worry the episode could stoke further the flames of support for the far right group shown in the latest poll to be published today as firmly entrenching its position as Greece\u2019s third major party with 11.5%t. On Thursday. Thessaloniki mayor Yiannis Boutaris said Golden Dawn\u2019s presence in parliament was \u201ca disgrace.\u201d \u201cGolden Dawn should not be in the parliament. This party is a disgrace for Greek society. The fact that this party is third is indicative of the abjection of Greek society.\u201d There's an upbeat mood in the US, to judge from the latest consumer survey. The Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan's sentiment index rose to its highest level for six years, up from 76.4 in April to 83.7 so far this month. That was higher than the forecast of around 78. Consumers were more positive about their personal finances than at any time since 2007, especially among households in the top third of income levels. Annalisa Piazza at Newedge Strategy said: Today's outcome was somehow at odds with the recent news on the development of the US economy that depicted a rather mixed picture, with solid retail sales versus sluggish business confidence indicators. If anything, consumer confidence might have been supported by lower gasoline prices that implicitly prop up buying conditions for US households. That said, we suspect US households continue to remain sceptical on the development of future activity as headwinds to growth remain well alive. The news has helped lift the Dow Jones Industrial Average by more than 50 points in early trading. Greece is on track to emerge from its economic slump next year, its lenders predicted today. The European Commission's latest report into Greece, published today (you can download it here), argued that Athens is making significant progress under its bailout deal. Following its latest visit to Greece, Troika officials remain convinced that the Greek economy will start growing in 2014, with a GDP increase of 0.6% next year. The top-line of the report is quite upbeat about a country that has suffered deeply since the crisis began: Public finances are steadily improving, the banking sector recapitalisation has reached an advanced stage and important structural reforms are being implemented, although further major efforts are needed to fully deliver the delayed public administration reform and to make the new semi-autonomous revenue administration effective in the fight against tax evasion. But the Troika also cautioned that the fiscal outlook beyond 2014 \"remains inherently uncertain\", as further austerity measures will be needed to hit future targets: The fiscal outlook depends to a large extent on progress in strengthening the tax and social security revenue administrations. Within the current macroeconomic framework, the gaps are currently estimated at about 1.7% of GDP in 2015 and 2.1% of GDP in 2016. The task of filling the gap in 2015-16 will be taken up in the context of the 2014 budget negotiations in the fall. The report also predicted that Greek wage costs will be driven down by another 7% this year, following a 4.2% drop in compensation per employee last year. That will mean Greece will \"regain its 1995 labour cost competitiveness position relative to the Euro area\" in 2014. The Troika also remains concerned about Greece's banks, saying they continue to face \"the consequences of the recession and the inability of some borrowers to service their debt obligations\". And on unemployment, the picture is pretty bleak, with the jobless rate expected to remain over 20% in three years time. The number of dismissals still remains high and the overall labour market is likely to remain weak until GDP begins to recover. Hence, the annual unemployment rate is projected to peak at 27.0% in 2013. Once the recovery gains traction, especially the frontloading of wage adjustments is projected to give rise to a relatively rapid and sustainable decline in unemployment to 26.0% in 2014 and to 21.0% in 2016. And on that note, I'm handing over to my colleague Nick Fletcher for the rest of the day (easing back into things). Thanks all, and best wishes for the weekend. GW Europe's contruction industry suffered another poor month in March, with output falling by 1.7% month-on-month across the eurozone (and 1.1% across the EU). The largest decreases were seen in Portugal (-10.7%), the Czech Republic (-7.6%) and Slovakia (-5.0%), with the highest increases in Romania (+2.8%) and Spain (+2.4%). New data was only available for 14 members of the EU: production fell in ten countries, and only rose in four. Would you be interested in meeting your fellow contributors - along with the journalists who run the blog? The Guardian\u2019s news community team are hosting a meet-up event at the Guardian\u2019s offices at Kings Place in London on 5th June. The setup will be informal - with drinks and nibbles and a chance to get to know other top contributors followed by a Q&amp;A with the Guardian liveblogging team. If you're interested in attending, please email james.walsh@guardian.co.uk. As it's quiet, here's a couple of interesting posts that caught the eye this morning.... Reuters' James Saft has written a nice piece about how quantitative easing may be backfiring, by encouraging investors to hold more cash rather than riskier assets. The thinking behind QE rests partly on the assumption that buying up government bonds will drive interest rates down and entice investors to tilt their holdings towards riskier investments like stocks. That in turn is supposed to goose investment and consumption. Unfortunately, that assumption may be running afoul of, or fouling up, the way in which most investors construct their portfolios. Saft is riffing off this research note published earlier this week Toby Nangle, fund manager at Threadneedle Investments. In it, Nangle explained how investors would usually buy government bonds as a handy hedge against riskier holdings in shares. QE, though, has driven prices so high that the strategy doesn't work: By bidding yields on government bonds down to current levels, monetary policymakers have largely extinguished government bonds as an effective portfolio hedge. Elsewhere, fund manager/blogger @pawelmorski has rattled out another interesting piece, pinning the blame for Europe's recent economic misery on its banks, rather than government austerity: It Is That Simple: Europe\u2019s Problem is the Banks. These two series are a long way from directly comparable but they\u2019re close enough that the divergence is interesting. US firms are borrowing again, European ones aren\u2019t. This looks like a clear-cut job for monetary policy. Timely, given the news this morning that Spain's bad bank debts are rising (see 9.07am). Yves Mersch, ECB executive board member, has given a speech in London today on the future of the eurozone, and the mistakes that led to the current crisis. It's an interesting insight into current thinking in the ECB, Mersch talks about the importance of getting banking union agreed, but also focuses on the need for 'structural' change within Europe. On how the crisis began, Mersch explained: The euro area has been facing insufficiencies on several fronts, all at the same time. Let me be blunt: it has had governance shortcomings, stretched states, fragile banks, shrinking economies, sinking confidence in institutions and doubts about its integrity. Each of these difficulties has exacerbated the others; it has been a vicious circle. The crisis did not originate in the euro area, nor is it limited to it. But inside the euro area it has inflicted severe losses and pain, particularly on the younger generation Mersch also fleshed out the challenge facing national governments: In most of the stressed euro area countries this still requires tough choices across the generations and over time: e.g. education versus pension entitlements, infrastructure versus healthcare, research and development versus defence, and so on. Strengthening of tax administrations and treasury systems, expenditure control, privatisation will also be crucial. Reducing the costs of bureaucracy will matter more than ever across the euro area. There are varying needs for true innovation clusters \u00e0-la-Silicon Valley, as well as investments in scientific and technical education, research and development, encouragement of \u201cangel investments\u201d, and grassroots and sustainable banking. Labour markets need to become inclusive and fair in every country, while encouraging labour mobility, in particular in a monetary union. Greater competitiveness and sustainable growth of the whole euro area will then follow. This has been a regular theme at Mario Draghi's press conferences too. Critics, though, argue that it's hard for leaders in, say, Italy or Spain to push through structural reforms at the same time as chasing demanding deficit-reduction targets. Mersch's speech is online here, resolutely titled: \u201cBuilt to Last\u201d: The New Euro Area Framework The Italian government has agreed to reform the unpopular IMU housing tax, a key demand from coalition partner, the People of Liberty party. Prime minister Enrico Letta told a press conference that payments will be suspended in June, adding: We are setting a time until August 31 within which the government and its supporting majority will reform IMU. Letta added that the cost of reforming IMU would come \"100%\" from spending cuts. IMU was introduced by former technocratic leader Mario Monti, and proved deeply unpopular. Silvio Berlusconi's election campaign earlier this year focused on his promise to abolish it. Getting rid of it altogether would cost \u20ac8bn. Letta also announced a new \u20ac1bn fund to help unemployed people get back to work. Opinion poll data today showed falling support for Italy's new coalition government of centre-left, centre-right and centrist parties. Letta only enjoyed 43% support when he was sworn in under a month ago, but has now lost nine percentage points. In the UK, a Bank of England monetary policymaker has declared that the British economy may be inching back to recovery. Martin Weale told an audience in Birmingham: No one can be certain but it is possible that the near-stagnation of the past three years is being replaced by a move to modest growth. Weale also argued that the BoE's monetary policy committee should resist acting like \"inflation nutters\", and use its new, more flexible mandate on inflation targeting wisely: The correct thing for policymakers to do would be to accept a modest degree of entrenchment of raised inflation expectations as a price worth paying for a smoother output path. The full speech is online here: and includes this handy graph showing how UK wage growth has stuttered to a near-standstill (just 0 .8% year-on-year) Weale's speech also includes a reference to a lecture given by some chap called Mark Carney.... Shares in several Europe's carmakers have risen today, following the news this morning that sales rose year-on-year in April. Peugeot Citroen is leading the risers, up 6% (despite reporting a 10% drop in its own sales during the month). Exciting scenes in the Greek parliament this morning, where a Golden Dawn MP was thrown out of the chamber amid a stream of cursing. Panayiotis Iliopoulos was shown the door after claiming that opposition party leader Alexis Tsipras was working on a \"souped-up question\" for prime minister Antonis Samaras. The PM, Iliopoulos claimed, was \"sleeping the sleep of the just\" (he's actually on a trip to China). Kathimerini has the details: Pulled up,,,for using derogatory language, Iliopoulos went further, condemning fellow MPs as \"wretched sell-outs\" and \"goats\". He was removed from the House, cursing all the while, witnesses said. Also in Friday's session, a request by former prime minister and socialist PASOK deputy George Papandreou to be granted leave so he can attend a conference abroad prompted hoots of laughter from Golden Dawn MPs in attendance. Speaking of Spanish banks... DonJuan points out below that the former boss of Caja Madrid was remanded in custody last night and relieved of his passport. Miguel Blesa is being investigated over \"alleged irregularities\" in the lender's $900m purchase of the City National Bank of Florida in 2008. El PaIs's story has more details: Caja Madrid took control of City National Bank of Florida in 2008 after paying 618 million euros for 83 percent of the US lender in a deal approved unanimously by the Spanish bank\u2019s board of directors in order to \u201cstrengthen\u201d its presence in America. The Bank of Spain noted that as well as excessive investment in the US lender the purchase was carried out in such a way as to \u201celude the obligatory control of the tax and economy authorities in Madrid.\u201d Caja Madrid is one of the firms that were merged to form Bankia, with ill-fated results. The rise in Spain's bad loans in March follows a drop earlier this year, when Spanish banks transferred some toxic assets to the country's new Bad Bank. Analysts fear that Spain's banking sector is still refusing to face reality by admitting that other loans won't be repaid.This is the \u201cdelay and pray\u201d strategy, where credit is extended even though the borrower is highly unlikely to repay the money. The FT did a good piece on the issue yesterday. In it, Santiago L\u00f3pez, a Madrid-based bank analyst at Exane BNP Paribas, explained: Some of the clients that have been restructured will eventually be able to pay back their debts. In many other cases the proverbial can has just been kicked down the road and we believe that banks will need significantly higher provisions to deal with restructured loans. The bad loans festering in Spain's financial sector swelled again in March, data just released by its central bank shows. A total of \u20ac163.3bn of loans are now 'non-performing\", the Bank of Spain reported. That pushes the bad loan ratio up to 10.47%, from 10.39% a month. The broader picture for Europe's car industry remains pretty tough this year -- even if April's encouraging data does show that the sales decline is bottoming out. Major manufacturers have suffered big losses in the region, and many assembly lines are running below full capacity. Last month alone, Ford reported that its European losses had tripled, while Volkswagen reported a 38% drop in earnings. It's a long, long way back to the heady pre-crash days - if, indeed, such conditions can be repeated. As Stephen Odell, head of Ford's European Operations, told the WSJ in an article published yesterday: We are hopeful that we can see signs of troughing or plateauing during the course of this year but I'm not sure that we have seen it yet. The rise in new car registrations last month shows consumers are more optimistic about economic prospects, argues Gian Primo Quagliano, the head of automotive research company CSP in Bologna, Italy. Quagliano told Bloomberg that recent talk of European leaders easing off on austerity in favour of growth-friendly measures is also helping: The recovery of sales in Germany is positive and may be an indication that consumers are getting back into the market on signs that austerity in Europe may be close to an end When the car market changes direction, the reason is never just related to technical calendar effects. More here. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage coverage of the Eurozone financial crisis, and other interesting developments across the global economy. And for once, we can start with some encouraging economic news -- European car sales have risen, breaking a downward trend that dates back to the end of September 2011. Purchases of new cars across the European Union in April were 1.7% higher than a year ago, data from the European Automobile Manufacturers Association (ACEA) released this morning showed. Rising demand from Germany (+3.8%), the UK (+14.8%) and -- perhaps most surprisingly -- Spain (+10.8%) led the way. These graphs, comparing monthly sales to the previous year, shows how the long downturn has finally been broken. ACEA's full report is here (pdf) We need to be cautious about hanging out the bunting, though. There are three reasons to be cautious: \u2022 There were another two working days in April 2013 - more opportunity to nip down to the showroom or haggle a credit agreement with the bank \u2022 Demand for new cars continued sliding in two key economies at the heart of the crisis - France (-5.3%) and Italy (-10.8%). \u2022 This small rally in April doesn't wipe away the disappointment of January, February and March. New car registrations over the first four months of the year are 7.1% lower than in 2012. And as ACEA put it: In absolute figures, it is the third lowest level of new registrations for a month of April. Still, it's nice to start the blog with some upbeat data, especially from a sector that's been badly dented by Europe's economic troubles. Reaction to follow... Coming up today, the main political developments could some in Italy, where Enrico Letta's cabinet is meeting to discuss measures to revive its economy. On the economics front, we have fresh eurozone construction data at 10am BST. And in finance, the European Central Bank will release an update on how much money has been repaid by banks who borrowed from its huge liquidity injections (the LTRO programme). I'll be tracking all the latest developments as usual.",

      "body": "<p><strong>Marks &amp; Spencer</strong> was in fashion last week after its autumn-winter collection and news of a cutback in suppliers were well received by analysts and investors.</p> <p>But chief executive Mark Bolland faces another test on Tuesday when he unveils an expected drop in full year profits of around \u00a340m to \u00a3666m. The shortfall could see Bolland take a hit on his performance related bonus payments.</p> <p>But with hopes that recent initiatives could give the retailer a boost, its shares closed up 10.3p at 451p on Friday, a 7% gain on the week.</p> <p>Panmure Gordon analyst Jean Roche issued a buy note with a 471p target ahead of the figures. She said:</p> <blockquote> Next week's results are unlikely to encourage consensus 2014 upgrades (our profit forecast of \u00a3734m, up 10.2%, is at the upper end of the consensus range) but we think that the market should be careful not to underestimate the positive effect that a well-received womenswear collection could have on the company's financial performance. </blockquote> <p>Overall leading shares hit a new five and a half year peak. A ten day winning streak for the <strong>FTSE 100</strong> - its best performance since July 2009 - came to an end on Thursday, but this proved a mere blip. On Friday the index finished at 6723.06, up 35.26 points on the day and almost 100 points on the week. The last time the index was this high was on 12 October 2007, and it came close to beating the peak of 6732 reached that year.</p> <p>Markets continued to be lifted by central bank actions to stimulate the global economy, along with reasonable economic data. Better than expected consumer confidence figures from the US helped investors regain their optimism when it seemed it may have been flagging.</p> <p>Unexpected takeover news in the water sector has also buoyed up the market. <strong>Severn Trent</strong> received and rejected an approach from a consortium consisting of Canada's Borealis infrastructure, the Kuwait Investment Office and the UK Universities Superannuation Scheme. Its shares jumped 13% on Tuesday, the day of the offer, but on Friday they dipped 12p to \u00a320.50. Reports suggested the potential bidders would offer just under \u00a320 a share. Tina Cook at Charles Stanley said:</p> <blockquote> At this stage, it is not clear whether the consortium will come back with a revised offer before the 11 June deadline. But, the modest share price reaction suggests that market participants believe the possibility is likely. <br> The timing of any potential deal remains somewhat surprising in that it comes just ahead of the UK water sector's next regulatory price review 2015-2020, which is currently underway and due to be finalised next year. This inevitably creates some mid-term risk across the sector. However, as Goldman Sachs notes, \"none of the previous approaches in the water sector that have been announced in the last 10 years has failed in taking over the water company\". </blockquote> <p>But controversial Kazakh miner <strong>Eurasian Natural Resources Corporation</strong> gave up early gains as its oligarch founders disappointed investors after putting the terms of their proposed bid to the board. The bidders - Alexander Machkevitch, Patokh Chodiev and Alijan Ibragimov, together with the Kazakh government - are believed to have made an offer of less than 300p a share. ENRC's independent directors said this undervalued the company, and the deadline for a firm bid has been extended until 3 June to allow the oligarchs time to come up with a new proposal or walk away.</p> <p>ENRC ended 8% lower at 271.6p.</p> <p>Sugar producers went sour after a warning of declining profits from Germany's Suedzucker, which blamed rising production costs, lower prices and fewer chances to sell non-quota products. <strong>Tate and Lyle</strong> lost 11.5p to 850p while <strong>Associated British Foods</strong>, which is probably best known for its Primark business these days but also owns British Sugar, fell 39p to \u00a318/86.</p> <p><strong>Intertek</strong> dropped 67p to \u00a333.85 after the testing specialist warned a decline in its minerals business was hitting profit margins.</p> <p>The company said revenues and profits from the division, especially in Australia, Brazil and the Philippines, had fallen more sharply than expected as a reduction in mining activities led to lower sample volumes and price competition. Overall revenues for the four months to the end of April rose 9.9% including the benefits of currency movements and recent acquisitions. Excluding these, the organic increase was 7%.</p> <p>But building materials group <strong>CRH</strong> climbed 35p to \u00a314.41 after a positive note from analysts at Davy Research, based on the outlook for supplying asphalt for US roadbuilding:</p> <blockquote> The value of US highway contracts awarded by state departments of transport fell 14% year-on-year in April, according to the American Road &amp; Transportation Builders Association. Since the start of the federal year, contracts awarded are up nearly 10% due to the increased visibility over spending levels. With the value of contracts awarded up sharply in the first six months of the year, it is not surprising to see a fall-off in April's figures. While it is early days, we see increased signs of improvement in state and local finances which will ultimately benefit CRH, the largest producer of asphalt for road construction in the US. </blockquote> <p><strong>Lloyds Banking Group</strong> shares ended above the 61p level which the UK government regards as its breakeven level, another sign that a sale of the stake could be on the cards.</p> <p>Lloyds closed 1.93p better at 62.84p having touched a high of 63.3p, following <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2013/may/16/lloyds-chief-pullout-tax-havens?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">an upbeat statement at Thursday's annual meeting</a>. Fellow taxpayer owned bank <strong>Royal Bank of Scotland</strong> rose18p to 336.8p, still well below the average price paid of 502p paid by the taxpayer.</p> <p>Meanwhile analyst Nick Nelson at UBS upgraded the European banking sector from underweight to overweight.

      "bodyText": "Marks &amp; Spencer was in fashion last week after its autumn-winter collection and news of a cutback in suppliers were well received by analysts and investors. But chief executive Mark Bolland faces another test on Tuesday when he unveils an expected drop in full year profits of around \u00a340m to \u00a3666m. The shortfall could see Bolland take a hit on his performance related bonus payments. But with hopes that recent initiatives could give the retailer a boost, its shares closed up 10.3p at 451p on Friday, a 7% gain on the week. Panmure Gordon analyst Jean Roche issued a buy note with a 471p target ahead of the figures. She said: Next week's results are unlikely to encourage consensus 2014 upgrades (our profit forecast of \u00a3734m, up 10.2%, is at the upper end of the consensus range) but we think that the market should be careful not to underestimate the positive effect that a well-received womenswear collection could have on the company's financial performance. Overall leading shares hit a new five and a half year peak. A ten day winning streak for the FTSE 100 - its best performance since July 2009 - came to an end on Thursday, but this proved a mere blip. On Friday the index finished at 6723.06, up 35.26 points on the day and almost 100 points on the week. The last time the index was this high was on 12 October 2007, and it came close to beating the peak of 6732 reached that year. Markets continued to be lifted by central bank actions to stimulate the global economy, along with reasonable economic data. Better than expected consumer confidence figures from the US helped investors regain their optimism when it seemed it may have been flagging. Unexpected takeover news in the water sector has also buoyed up the market. Severn Trent received and rejected an approach from a consortium consisting of Canada's Borealis infrastructure, the Kuwait Investment Office and the UK Universities Superannuation Scheme. Its shares jumped 13% on Tuesday, the day of the offer, but on Friday they dipped 12p to \u00a320.50. Reports suggested the potential bidders would offer just under \u00a320 a share. Tina Cook at Charles Stanley said: At this stage, it is not clear whether the consortium will come back with a revised offer before the 11 June deadline. But, the modest share price reaction suggests that market participants believe the possibility is likely. The timing of any potential deal remains somewhat surprising in that it comes just ahead of the UK water sector's next regulatory price review 2015-2020, which is currently underway and due to be finalised next year. This inevitably creates some mid-term risk across the sector. However, as Goldman Sachs notes, \"none of the previous approaches in the water sector that have been announced in the last 10 years has failed in taking over the water company\". But controversial Kazakh miner Eurasian Natural Resources Corporation gave up early gains as its oligarch founders disappointed investors after putting the terms of their proposed bid to the board. The bidders - Alexander Machkevitch, Patokh Chodiev and Alijan Ibragimov, together with the Kazakh government - are believed to have made an offer of less than 300p a share. ENRC's independent directors said this undervalued the company, and the deadline for a firm bid has been extended until 3 June to allow the oligarchs time to come up with a new proposal or walk away. ENRC ended 8% lower at 271.6p. Sugar producers went sour after a warning of declining profits from Germany's Suedzucker, which blamed rising production costs, lower prices and fewer chances to sell non-quota products. Tate and Lyle lost 11.5p to 850p while Associated British Foods, which is probably best known for its Primark business these days but also owns British Sugar, fell 39p to \u00a318/86. Intertek dropped 67p to \u00a333.85 after the testing specialist warned a decline in its minerals business was hitting profit margins. The company said revenues and profits from the division, especially in Australia, Brazil and the Philippines, had fallen more sharply than expected as a reduction in mining activities led to lower sample volumes and price competition. Overall revenues for the four months to the end of April rose 9.9% including the benefits of currency movements and recent acquisitions. Excluding these, the organic increase was 7%. But building materials group CRH climbed 35p to \u00a314.41 after a positive note from analysts at Davy Research, based on the outlook for supplying asphalt for US roadbuilding: The value of US highway contracts awarded by state departments of transport fell 14% year-on-year in April, according to the American Road &amp; Transportation Builders Association. Since the start of the federal year, contracts awarded are up nearly 10% due to the increased visibility over spending levels. With the value of contracts awarded up sharply in the first six months of the year, it is not surprising to see a fall-off in April's figures. While it is early days, we see increased signs of improvement in state and local finances which will ultimately benefit CRH, the largest producer of asphalt for road construction in the US. Lloyds Banking Group shares ended above the 61p level which the UK government regards as its breakeven level, another sign that a sale of the stake could be on the cards. Lloyds closed 1.93p better at 62.84p having touched a high of 63.3p, following an upbeat statement at Thursday's annual meeting. Fellow taxpayer owned bank Royal Bank of Scotland rose18p to 336.8p, still well below the average price paid of 502p paid by the taxpayer. Meanwhile analyst Nick Nelson at UBS upgraded the European banking sector from underweight to overweight. His reasons: (1) The macro backdrop is stabilising. (2) Relative earnings momentum is improving. (3) Banks are shifting from being big issuers of equity towards being high cash returners (the dividend yield on the sector is forecast to be above the market next year for the first time since 2007). And (4) valuations are still attractive: the price/book value ratio is just roughly half that of the market (52%), not far off the Lehman low of 43% of the market.

    "webTitle": "Ocado tie-up to help Morrisons start selling groceries online", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "A major spat is brewing among the grocers after Ocado signed a 25-year deal with Morrisons supermarket, enraging its long-term partner Waitrose. Waitrose has demanded to see details of the distribution deal, which will allow Morrisons to start grocery deliveries by next January. It has instructed lawyers to examine its existing contract with Ocado to find out whether the company has breached its terms. A spokesman for the high-class supermarket said: \"What we have to decide is whether Ocado is introducing a competitor into the marketplace.\" Ocado chief executive Tim Steiner said he had not heard from Waitrose's lawyers. \"This is 100% within the terms of our contract [with Waitrose]. We have a sourcing agreement that we will buy [from Waitrose] products we sell to Ocado.com customers and we will not offer for sale own-label products of another [UK] supermarket.\" The agreement with Morrisons does not conflict with those terms, he said. The Bradford-based grocer will use Ocado's technology and distribution network but retain its own branding for online deliveries. Morrisons' chief executive, Dalton Philips, said: \"This is a Morrisons website, it's Morrisons food in a Morrisons van with a Morrisons driver; it's Morrisons the whole way through. [Ocado] are simply providing the technology and the platform.\" Morrisons has blamed its lack of an online operation for a slump in sales and Philips said the deal would propel it \"into the fast lane\" of the rapidly expanding market for online grocery shopping. Shares in the supermarket chain rose 1.2% on the news. But it was Ocado that was the real winner in the stock market on Friday. Its shares rose by as much as 50% in early trade, dropping back later but still 29% higher on the day. Investors were applauding the fact Ocado had found a new revenue stream, as its partnership with Waitrose grows increasingly unstable. Ocado mostly sells Waitrose food, although it has been adding products from foreign supermarkets to its range since 2011. Waitrose helped Ocado launch in 2001 with a cash injection of \u00a346m, leaving it with a 40% stake in the business, the last of which it sold in 2011. The pair's current 10-year supply contract lasts until 2020, with a break clause in 2017. But Waitrose has expanded its own direct delivery service in recent years, causing analysts to question Ocado's long-term business model. The high-class supermarket announced on Friday that it would open a second \"dark store\" in London to meet the growing demand for Waitrose.com. Ocado said it would continue to sell Waitrose products via Ocado.com and that customers would see no change in the service they received. Chief executive Steiner insisted Waitrose would benefit from the deal because Morrisons' investment would allow Ocado to improve its technology and grow faster. He said it could lead to other arrangements to license its technology to foreign supermarkets and non-food stores in the UK. \"We've talked to a lot of people but no conversations are anywhere near as advanced as what we've reached with Morrisons.\" Under the terms of the Morrisons deal, Ocado can only provide technology to one other UK grocer \u2013 which would currently be its own online business \u2013 but foreign competitors are not barred. Ocado's chairman, Lord Grade, said at the company's annual meeting last week: \"The intellectual property of the business, we believe, is going to be very, very valuable and how we exploit that in the future domestically and internationally is very much a matter for the board in due course.\" Morrisons will pay \u00a3170m to buy Ocado's second warehouse, at Dordon, Warwickshire. It will also invest \u00a346m to expand the facility, which it will lease back to Ocado. It will pay 1% of sales from Morrisons.com to Ocado, plus 25% of any cash profits generated by the website, which declines to 10% after 15 years. It expects the online operation to start making money from 2017/18. There are a series of other fees, including \u00a330m to license Ocado's technology, plus contributions towards the group's research and development costs. Morrisons said the operation will create 3,000 jobs when it is using its full share of capacity at the Ocado warehouse, which it expects to do in three to four years time. Ocado shares jumped to 260p, while Morrisons ticked up to 286p. Philip Dorgan, analyst at City broker Panmure Gordon, said it was not a good deal for Morrisons: \"While it achieves the objective of getting online, it comes at a big cost. In particular, signing a 25-year deal in an online world with an unprofitable, unproven operator looks likely to cause problems.\"",

      "body": "<p>A major spat is brewing among the grocers after Ocado signed a 25-year deal with Morrisons supermarket, enraging its long-term partner Waitrose.</p> <p>Waitrose has demanded to see details of the distribution deal, which will allow Morrisons to start grocery deliveries by next January. It has <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/may/10/waitrose-ocado-morrisons-talks\" title=\"\">instructed lawyers to examine its existing contract with Ocado</a> to find out whether the company has breached its terms.</p> <p>A spokesman for the high-class supermarket said: \"What we have to decide is whether Ocado is introducing a competitor into the marketplace.\"</p> <p>Ocado chief executive Tim Steiner said he had not heard from Waitrose's lawyers. \"This is 100% within the terms of our contract [with Waitrose]. We have a sourcing agreement that we will buy [from Waitrose] products we sell to Ocado.com customers and we will not offer for sale own-label products of another [UK] supermarket.\" The agreement with Morrisons does not conflict with those terms, he said.</p> <p>The Bradford-based grocer will use Ocado's technology and distribution network but retain its own branding for online deliveries. Morrisons' chief executive, Dalton Philips, said: \"This is a Morrisons website, it's Morrisons food in a Morrisons van with a Morrisons driver; it's Morrisons the whole way through. [Ocado] are simply providing the technology and the platform.\"</p> <p>Morrisons has blamed its lack of an online operation for a slump in sales and Philips said the deal would propel it \"into the fast lane\" of the rapidly expanding market for online grocery shopping. Shares in the supermarket chain rose 1.2% on the news.</p> <p>But it was Ocado that was the real winner in the stock market on Friday. Its shares rose by as much as 50% in early trade, dropping back later but still 29% higher on the day. Investors were applauding the fact Ocado had found a new revenue stream, as its partnership with Waitrose grows increasingly unstable.</p> <p>Ocado mostly sells Waitrose food, although it has been adding products from foreign supermarkets to its range since 2011. Waitrose helped Ocado launch in 2001 with a cash injection of \u00a346m, leaving it with a 40% stake in the business, the last of which it sold in 2011. The pair's current 10-year supply contract lasts until 2020, with a break clause in 2017.</p> <p>But Waitrose has expanded its own direct delivery service in recent years, causing analysts to question Ocado's long-term business model. The high-class supermarket announced on Friday that it would open a second \"dark store\" in London to meet the growing demand for Waitrose.com.</p> <p>Ocado said it would continue to sell Waitrose products via Ocado.com and that customers would see no change in the service they received. Chief executive Steiner insisted Waitrose would benefit from the deal because Morrisons' investment would allow Ocado to improve its technology and grow faster.</p> <p>He said it could lead to other arrangements to license its technology to foreign supermarkets and non-food stores in the UK. \"We've talked to a lot of people but no conversations are anywhere near as advanced as what we've reached with Morrisons.\" Under the terms of the Morrisons deal, Ocado can only provide technology to one other UK grocer \u2013 which would currently be its own online business \u2013 but foreign competitors are not barred.</p> <p>Ocado's chairman, Lord Grade, said at the company's annual meeting last week: \"The intellectual property of the business, we believe, is going to be very, very valuable and how we exploit that in the future domestically and internationally is very much a matter for the board in due course.\"</p> <p>Morrisons will pay \u00a3170m to buy Ocado's second warehouse, at Dordon, Warwickshire.
