      "bodyText": "Centrica, the owner of British Gas, has come under fire from fuel poverty campaigners before announcing profits of almost \u00a33bn this week. The energy group is expected to announce broadly flat group operating profits of \u00a32.8bn for 2013, with the British Gas \"UK downstream\" business contributing \u00a31.05bn, down 4% from 2012, City analysts say. \"A slight drop in already astronomical profits will provide little succour to the millions struggling with high bills, cold homes and unwanted prepayment meters precisely because of the profiteering of this company,\" said a spokeswoman for the Fuel Poverty Action group. \"Although Centrica care little for their customers freezing to death in their homes they have shown commitment to their shareholders, by recently handing back \u00a3420m to them, and a commitment to fracking in Lancashire, despite community objections, in their insatiable lust for profit,\" she added. Centrica, which has by far the largest market share of the UK gas and electricity supply market, has traditionally been a lightning rod for critics of the wider big six power providers. A spokesman for the group insisted it was working hard to help tackle fuel poverty. \"Last year we assisted nearly 2 million vulnerable households with discounts and free insulation. This winter more than half a million British Gas customers received the Warm Home Discount, worth \u00a3135. In addition, many of them also received a new top-up discount worth \u00a360,\" said a spokesman. Centrica's profit margin averages about 5% after tax across the group, he added: \"We use this to make the big investments and commitments which secure vital energy supplies for British homes.\" Centrica has spent more than \u00a314bn on a series of big gas contracts with companies in the US and Qatar under which it buys wholesale supplies that can last 20 years. But the company has also thrown its weight behind attempts to prove shale gas reserves in Britain through a partnership with Cuadrilla Resources under which it takes a 25% stake in a promising Lancashire exploration licence. Centrica's British Gas featured prominently in a Which? review of complaints about the big six from customers. The worst offender was npower but 24 of every 1,000 British Gas customers issued complaints against the company in the last three months of 2013 after domestic price rises had been announced. Shares in Centrica fell 3% last Monday after a warning by Ed Davey, the energy and climate change secretary, that large power firms might need to be broken up to tackle market dominance. The company argued that Britain had one of the most competitive energy markets in the world, with gas and electricity prices among the lowest in western Europe. But Fuel Poverty Action said it wanted a not-for-profit, renewable energy system which put communities and those in fuel poverty first. Until that happened, said the spokeswoman, \"the likes of British Gas will continue to make a killing and in return will remain a target for anger and protest\".",

      "bodyText": "Royal Mail and the Communication Workers Union (CWU) have started talks on a company charter to enshrine their post-privatisation agreement over working conditions for more than 100,000 workers so that the terms can only be overturned by a vote of the company's shareholders. The two sides had initial talks on the charter last Monday after CWU members voted this month to ratify their industrial relations deal, drawn up to end years of strife. The union has made it clear that it wants Royal Mail shareholders to agree the charter. Royal Mail and the CWU aim to complete the charter by June, ahead of its first annual general meeting as a private company later in the summer. Ratification by shareholders would lock Royal Mail into the agreement beyond its five-year term unless investors chose to overturn the charter at a later date. The charter was mentioned briefly in the legal agreement announced in December, but Dave Ward, deputy general secretary of the CWU, said its importance had been overlooked and that it was a key element of the deal, agreed by 94% of CWU members who took part in a vote announced on 5 February. \"For me it's about setting out very clearly what the values and principles are of this company. We want it to demonstrate that we are up for growth, innovation and change but on the basis of the highest possible employment standards and service levels,\" Ward said. In addition to agreements on pay and pensions, the union secured undertakings from Royal Mail on workers' contracts, keeping the company's universal service and other subjects it wanted agreed under privatisation. In return, the CWU agreed to industrial relations procedures designed to bring in mediators early and stop local strikes getting out of hand. The government sold a 60% stake in Royal Mail to investors in October and will dispose of the rest in the coming years. The union opposed privatisation and warned of a \"race to the bottom\" if the City and management conspired to squeeze the workforce to boost their own rewards. The union wants to cement an abiding set of principles to prevent new management imposing harsher conditions after the current deal expires. It also wants to guard against new investors such as hedge funds putting pressure on management to take on the union once the government's remaining stake is sold. Nick Bacon, professor of human resource management at Cass Business School, said: \"It's a great idea because at the heart of all good industrial relations are shared values and behaviours. It's certainly unusual in the private sector. \"The main downside for managers is it gives the union a set of values they can throw back at you and to tie you in to a particular type of process. In some situations managers may think they need to act more quickly and be more decisive.\" The two sides will lock horns over how specific the charter's terms will be. The vote to shareholders is not yet agreed but the union has made it clear that is what it wants. Royal Mail said: \"We are commencing the process of developing a company charter, with the CWU's input. It will set out the values and principles Royal Mail Group stands for.\" The company did not comment on whether the charter would be put to shareholders.",

    "webTitle": "Could Justine Greening's budget help educate Syria's displaced children? | Larry Elliott", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Justine Greening is the luckiest of cabinet ministers. Not for her the spending cuts visited upon Theresa May at the Home Office or Vince Cable at the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills. International development is a ringfenced priority for the government and its budget has bucked the austerity trend and risen to \u00a311bn a year. But every silver lining has a cloud, and for Greening the cloud is that justifying spending more on poor people overseas is a hard sell when living standards and public services are being squeezed at home. That's especially true when large chunks of the country are under water, and it was no surprise to hear Nigel Farage demanding last week that part of the international development budget be diverted to help flood victims. Although David Cameron rejected Farage's idea, aid has clearly become a political issue. Many Conservative supporters agree with the Ukip leader, as does the Daily Mail. Greening is under pressure to ensure the money she gets from George Osborne is spent wisely in places that need it and on projects that provide value for money. One such cause is educating the Syrian children who have fled across the border into Lebanon, which formed a new government at the weekend after months of political deadlock. Here's how things stand. At the last count there were 300,000 Syrians of school age living as refugees in Lebanon. More and more people are fleeing the civil war in Syria and the number of refugee children is likely to peak at 500,000. Lebanon is a small country \u2013 population four million \u2013 struggling to cope with the influx. It is as if London were faced with finding school places for all the children in Manchester and Birmingham, or New York landed with the children of Chicago and Washington DC \u2013 only worse, because Lebanon is poorer than the UK and the US and its economy is suffering collateral damage from the conflict in Syria. Before the civil war, almost every child in Syria was in school. It had a good record for enrolment at primary and secondary level. Many of those children are now in Lebanon where only one in eight children aged six to 14 is in school. To put that in context, that is less than half the level in South Sudan. For secondary school-age children the situation is even more grim, with only 5% being educated. Many of the children who have fled Syria have been traumatised by their experiences, including seeing classmates killed by sniper fire while on the way to school. Some are being catered for by the Lebanese education system, but many more are being sent out to work and beg. Girls as young as 13 have been sold into marriage. The risk here is obvious. There will be a lost generation of Syrian children who receive next to no education and grow up full of anger and resentment. Greening has put \u00a330m into the No Lost Generation initiative, designed to provide Syrian children with education, protection and emotional support. But the humanitarian response to the Syrian conflict is not sufficient to deal with the education crisis in Lebanon. According to Kevin Watkins, the director of Britain's Overseas Development Institute, less than half of the humanitarian financing requested for Lebanon has been delivered and very little of it has found its way into schools, where around 30,000 Syrian children are being educated. Something bigger, more ambitious, and more immediate is needed. Watkins has come up with a solution for the UN that is being championed by Gordon Brown, special education envoy to the UN secretary general, Ban Ki-moon. It involves keeping Lebanese schools open day and night in a double-shift system, using refugee Syrian teachers to provide lessons. School meals would be provided. Watkins estimates the cost of his plan would be about $500m (\u00a3300m) over three years and says it should be delivered jointly by the UN children's agency, Unicef, and the Lebanese government. Donors would put money into a pooled fund, which would be overseen by an accounting firm such as PwC to ensure that the money was properly spent. It is a good plan, offering value for money and hope of a future for the displaced children of Syria. What it lacks at the moment is cash and political momentum, both of which Greening is in a position to provide. Britain has been generous in its response to the Syrian crisis. Its humanitarian aid has broken records, and the UK is second only to the US in the international list of donors. Most of that aid is for survival \u2013 food, shelter and medicines \u2013 but some will trickle down into the education system. That said, the only UK aid money specifically aimed at education is \u00a34m for textbooks, only 25% of which will be spent on Syrian refugees.

      "body": "<p>Justine Greening is the luckiest of cabinet ministers. Not for her the spending cuts visited upon Theresa May at the Home Office or Vince Cable at the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills. International development is a ringfenced priority for the government and its budget has bucked the austerity trend and risen to \u00a311bn a year.</p> <p>But every silver lining has a cloud, and for Greening the cloud is that justifying spending more on poor people overseas is a hard sell when living standards and public services are being squeezed at home.</p> <p>That's especially true when large chunks of the country are under water, and it was no surprise to hear <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/feb/09/nigel-farage-uk-aid-budget-somerset-flood-victims\" title=\"\">Nigel Farage demanding last week that part of the international development budget be diverted to help flood victims</a>.</p> <p>Although David Cameron rejected Farage's idea, aid has clearly become a political issue. Many Conservative supporters agree with the Ukip leader, as does the Daily Mail. Greening is under pressure to ensure the money she gets from George Osborne is spent wisely in places that need it and on projects that provide value for money.</p> <p>One such cause is educating the Syrian children who have fled across the border into Lebanon, which <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/feb/15/lebanon-forms-new-government-salam\" title=\"\">formed a new government at the weekend</a> after months of political deadlock.</p> <p>Here's how things stand. At the last count there were 300,000 Syrians of school age living as refugees in Lebanon. More and more people are fleeing the civil war in Syria and the number of refugee children is likely to peak at 500,000.</p> <p>Lebanon is a small country \u2013 population four million \u2013 struggling to cope with the influx. It is as if London were faced with finding school places for all the children in Manchester and Birmingham, or New York landed with the children of Chicago and Washington DC \u2013 only worse, because Lebanon is poorer than the UK and the US and its economy is suffering collateral damage from the conflict in Syria.</p> <p>Before the civil war, almost every child in Syria was in school. It had a good record for enrolment at primary and secondary level. Many of those children are now in Lebanon where only one in eight children aged six to 14 is in school. To put that in context, that is less than half the level in South Sudan.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-432797293\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/2/16/1392559093270/A-Syrian-woman-at-a-refug-009.jpg\" alt=\"A Syrian woman at a refugee camp in Bekaa valley Lebanon\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A Syrian woman and children at a refugee camp in Bekaa valley, eastern Lebanon. Photograph: Jamal Saidi/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>For secondary school-age children the situation is even more grim, with only 5% being educated. Many of the children who have fled Syria have been traumatised by their experiences, including seeing classmates killed by sniper fire while on the way to school. Some are being catered for by the Lebanese education system, but many more are being sent out to work and beg. Girls as young as 13 have been sold into marriage.</p> <p>The risk here is obvious. There will be a lost generation of Syrian children who receive next to no education and grow up full of anger and resentment. Greening has put \u00a330m into the No Lost Generation initiative, designed to provide Syrian children with education, protection and emotional support.</p> <p>But the humanitarian response to the Syrian conflict is not sufficient to deal with the education crisis in Lebanon. According to Kevin Watkins, the director of Britain's Overseas Development Institute, less than half of the humanitarian financing requested for Lebanon has been delivered and very little of it has found its way into schools, where around 30,000 Syrian children are being educated. Something bigger, more ambitious, and more immediate is needed.</p> <p>Watkins has come up with a solution for the UN that is being championed by Gordon Brown, special education envoy to the UN secretary general, Ban Ki-moon. It involves keeping Lebanese schools open day and night in a double-shift system, using refugee Syrian teachers to provide lessons. School meals would be provided.</p> <p>Watkins estimates the cost of his plan would be about $500m (\u00a3300m) over three years and says it should be delivered jointly by the UN children's agency, Unicef, and the Lebanese government. Donors would put money into a pooled fund, which would be overseen by an accounting firm such as PwC to ensure that the money was properly spent.</p> <p>It is a good plan, offering value for money and hope of a future for the displaced children of Syria. What it lacks at the moment is cash and political momentum, both of which Greening is in a position to provide.</p> <p>Britain has been generous in its response to the Syrian crisis. Its humanitarian aid has broken records, and the UK is second only to the US in the international list of donors. Most of that aid is for survival \u2013 food, shelter and medicines \u2013 but some will trickle down into the education system.</p> <p>That said, the only UK aid money specifically aimed at education is \u00a34m for textbooks, only 25% of which will be spent on Syrian refugees. Alan Duncan, the international development minister, said in the Commons last week that the government supported Brown's proposal and intended to do more. That was a clear signal that Greening intends to put money behind the scheme.</p> <p>A financial commitment by the UK would be welcome, although as always the devil is in the detail. Greening needs to put a sizeable amount in the pot and use the pledge to put pressure on the other big donors \u2013 such as the EU and the US \u2013 to match or better it.</p> <p>Greening is a careful operator.

Interviewed on the BBC's Andrew Marr Show, the governor of the Bank of England said a change in compensation structures was needed so that banks could see whether employees had taken undue risks or behaved badly. Carney's comments followed news last week that Barclays was paying bigger bonuses despite announcing plans to shed staff in response to a fall in profits. He declined to talk about specific banks, but said: \"Compensation of bankers should be held back and deferred for a very long time. There should be an ability and an expectation that a firm takes back compensation if an individual is found to have taken risks or if there are conduct issues. More pay should be deferred for a longer period.\" Carney said the Bank of England now had the powers to step in and limit bonus payments if a bank was deemed to have inadequate levels of capital. He said the Bank was keeping an eye on developments in the housing market, but the recovery in activity and prices were taking place from historically low levels. \"We have to be very conscious of the economic history of Britain, and there is a history of boom and subsequent bust,\" Carney said, noting that the Bank's financial policy committee had already started to announce measures designed to prevent a bubble from developing. Carney said the Treasury's Help to Buy mortgage guarantee scheme currently involved only a small number of properties, most of them low-value transactions for first-time buyers outside London. But he said that house prices were now rising in every region of Britain apart from Northern Ireland. The governor reiterated that the Bank would start to increase interest rates only when the economy was operating at closer to full capacity. \"The path of monetary policy, the path of interest rates is going to be calibrated very carefully to ensure that only when we see sustainable growth in jobs, in incomes and in spending, will we make adjustments,\" he said. \"We can responsibly take our time and only adjust interest rates once more slack has been cut.\"",

He can dismiss London's scaremongering all he likes, but given the logic of London's position he needs to stop talking about separation as if it is some form of Devo Max, and be realistic about becoming a confident new country.</p> <h2>Private equity calling?<br></h2> <p>The private equity market suffered a drubbing during the credit crunch as buyout firms reaped the consequences of acquiring assets such as EMI with too much debt. But talk of mega-deals is reviving, with the sector sitting on unused funds worth more than $1 trillion (\u00a3600bn).</p> <p>This means that buyout talk will inevitably dwell upon listed businesses that are publicly struggling with strategic quandaries under the baleful eye of the shareholder community. Last week it was the turn of Morrisons to be the subject of takeover speculation as it battles with the question of whether it is undermining its value credentials by being pricier than Asda, and whether it should spend millions on an online service rather than cutting prices.</p> <p>Outfits like Morrisons must ask whether a debt-laden buyout is the kind of breathing space they need. For many companies post-2008, such a move was disastrous. But struggling listed firms should be prepared for the private equity call.</p>",

The Daily Record reported that former SNP deputy leader Jim Sillars, Yes Scotland chairman Dennis Canavan and Scottish Green party co-convenor Patrick Harvie have all urged Mr Independence to adopt a separate currency. But Salmond wants to avoid opposition jibes that quitting the UK comes with huge risks. When Scots report that they will reject separation if it costs them even a small dip in their standard of living, a purely emotional plea to their sense of self is off the agenda. Yet without a switch now to full independence with a new currency, Salmond faces the prospect of going into the election offering the electorate a messy negotiation with an unknown outcome. He can dismiss London's scaremongering all he likes, but given the logic of London's position he needs to stop talking about separation as if it is some form of Devo Max, and be realistic about becoming a confident new country. Private equity calling? The private equity market suffered a drubbing during the credit crunch as buyout firms reaped the consequences of acquiring assets such as EMI with too much debt. But talk of mega-deals is reviving, with the sector sitting on unused funds worth more than $1 trillion (\u00a3600bn). This means that buyout talk will inevitably dwell upon listed businesses that are publicly struggling with strategic quandaries under the baleful eye of the shareholder community. Last week it was the turn of Morrisons to be the subject of takeover speculation as it battles with the question of whether it is undermining its value credentials by being pricier than Asda, and whether it should spend millions on an online service rather than cutting prices. Outfits like Morrisons must ask whether a debt-laden buyout is the kind of breathing space they need. For many companies post-2008, such a move was disastrous. But struggling listed firms should be prepared for the private equity call.",

Rival BSkyB's model is built \u2013 beyond sports \u2013 on exclusive deals with the \"big six\" Hollywood studios for blockbuster films, securing top US dramas such as Game of Thrones and Mad Men, and spending \u00a3600m a year into making its own TV shows such as Fleming, a biopic of the Bond author. Industry observers suggest that BT may well look to follow Sky into film and entertainment next, adding another pillar of must-watch programming to its offering. Alex Green, BT's director of TV, is certainly aware of the potential value of drama and entertainment for its pay-TV service. \"We are definitely exploring further opportunities in how to continue to differentiate and broaden our entertainment proposition,\" he said. \"We are exploring all sorts of things. Netflix has shown the power of a well-marketed TV property. House of Cards can do wonders for a TV platform.\" Sky, meanwhile, is keenly aware of the threat it faces, opting to renew its deal with HBO \u2013 home of big budget dramas including The Sopranos and The Wire \u2013 nearly two years before the current five-year deal expires. Sky's deals with the major Hollywood studios \u2013 Disney, Warner Bros, Paramount, 20th Century Fox, Sony Pictures and Universal Studios \u2013 come up for renewal in 2017 and 2018. But if a nervy Sky is hoping for another early strike to thwart a potential BT swoop, a rights battle could break out as soon as next year. Analysts at IHS put the total value of Sky's movie deals at between \u00a3300m and \u00a3350m a year. BT has never struck a deal to allow its customers to watch Sky Atlantic, which screens HBO programming, despite it now being three years since the channel launched. Green said: \"There is nothing to be said [at this stage] on original drama, original content \u2013 it is too early.\" Nevertheless BT has in the past admitted that, to compete, it needs to go beyond sport and add a strong entertainment offering. In its submission to the Competition Commission's 2011 investigation into Sky's control of Hollywood film deals, BT said: \"Premium movie channels and/or subscription services that encompass first-run Hollywood movies are, along with sports, the most effective driver of pay-TV subscriptions. Without access to such channels/services, a pay-TV operator's ability to compete in retail pay-TV markets is severely limited.\" Green said BT still believes Sky has a \"stranglehold\" on Hollywood movie rights. But he said the arrival of players such as Netflix has shown that winning in this market is about more than the film rights to the \"first pay-TV window\" \u2013 a deal covering an exclusive period after a film is shown in cinemas. \"We think the market is moving, and companies like Netflix and others are driving changes in behaviour,\" he said. \"Sky has a stranglehold, but our sole objective isn't to break that stranglehold.

      "bodyText": "Mark Carney used the word \"recovery\" 23 times when he presented the Bank of England's latest outlook for the economy last week. But does it feel like a recovery where you live? Readers in the north-east, where the unemployment rate is 10.3%, may be baffled by the Bank's assertion that jobs are being created at the quickest pace since records began. The whole starting point for the governor overhauling his forward guidance policy last Wednesday was that the 7% unemployment threshold \u2013 the point at which the Bank might consider raising interest rates \u2013 would be breached within weeks. Not in the north-east it won't. In the south-east, however, the jobless rate is already down to 5.3%. Carney also noted that the recovery has been underpinned by a revival in confidence. But a small-business owner battered by floods in Somerset may question what shreds of already fragile confidence will be left when the water finally recedes. As for the \"strengthening\" housing market Carney cited, again there are stark regional disparities. A homeowner in the north-west looking to cash in on the much-discussed boom will have no doubt already learned with disappointment that prices in the region are up just 0.6% in annual terms \u2013 a fraction of the 5.4% UK average and dwarfed by London's 11.6%. One word that neither Carney, nor his team's weighty inflation report, mentioned once was \"regional\". He said the recovery was \"neither balanced nor sustainable\". But there was no reference to the widening gap between the south-east and elsewhere. Perhaps he has learned from his predecessor Eddie George's experience in the early days of the monetary policy committee. George faced calls to step down after his remarks at a lunch with regional reporters were taken to suggest he thought unemployment in the north-east was a price worth paying to curb inflation nationally. The point George tried to make is the Bank's policy levers operate at a national level. The best that businesses and households can hope for is that the policymakers are listening to the Bank's regional agents \u2013 their eyes and ears in 12 offices around the UK. On that front, Carney's assertion that rate rises are far off and will be only gradual is reassuring; less so his statement that policymakers are \"serene but not complacent\". This regional challenge is by no means unique to the Bank, of course. On a larger and more complex scale, the European Central Bank must try to set policy for a wildly divergent eurozone. But while the currency bloc still faces significant hurdles before it can clamber out of crisis, in the UK there are reasons to be more cheerful. Richard Holt, who, as regional economist for thinktank Capital Economics, watches data from all parts of the UK, says there is now recovery across the whole country, albeit at differing rates. There are promising signs around the country that Carney's \"escape velocity\" will eventually be achieved beyond the south-east. The city of Nottingham, reaping rewards from its own locally tailored jobs and growth plan, has reported record rates of new business creation, and the wider East Midlands region has been enjoying some of the fastest employment growth in the UK. While by many measures Wales is underperforming the UK, Holt points to promising news in the north, where Toyota engines are built, after the carmaker enjoyed a jump in sales. In Birmingham, demand for business and holiday flights has seen the airport report its first double-digit growth in passengers for eight years. But while all parts may now be recovering, those that started from a lower base are not growing as fast as the south-east. The south now takes a bigger share of GDP than in 2010. The news on jobs creation is equally stark. London alone was responsible for four out of every five jobs created in the private sector between 2010 and 2012, according to the thinktank Centre for Cities. In short, while George Osborne came to the Treasury with a promise to create an economy that was balanced both by sectors and by regions, the old divides have simply been entrenched. To be fair, the south's share of the economy had already been rising under Labour since 1997. Carney cannot narrow those gaps with monetary policy. That challenge has to be taken up by industrial strategy, infrastructure plans and devolution of spending power to regions and cities. The coalition was given plenty of food for thought in Michael Heseltine's \"No Stone Unturned\" plan for widespread growth. But it has only timidly adopted some of his recommendations. If the next election is to be fought on living standards, then voters will be looking for plans that reboot regional economies. They will want to see strategies that offer some hope that pay and prospects can close in on the levels in London and the south-east. That means helping regional leaders attract the kind of industries that will provide the productivity boost that, to the Bank's surprise, has eluded the UK. It means delivering the transport links and skilled workers to make UK cities attractive to foreign companies. As Osborne drafts next month's budget, he faces the challenge of explaining how he will shore up the recovery beyond the south-east \u2013 but not to the cost of the south-east, now clearly the UK's engine of growth and the key source of tax revenues. And, just maybe, the chancellor could seize the opportunity to prove he is serious about his vow to turn the tide on the centralisation that \"shackles local ambition and creativity\". But perhaps I am just being serene and complacent.",

      "bodyText": "For her 18th birthday, in 1981, Carol Marsh's parents gave her a ZX81 computer. The ZX81, a small black box with four chips, a single kilobyte of memory and a tendency to overheat, was the first mass-market computer, and got a generation hooked on messing around with circuit boards. \"You could buy it as a kit. It came with instructions so I put it together. I never thought anything of it,\" she says. Marsh went on to become one of the first women to gain a higher national diploma in electrical and electronic engineering at Napier University, in her home city of Edinburgh. The first in her family to go to university, she fell into the world of logic gates and binary numbers, discovering \"the thrill of designing things and seeing them work\". When she got married in her third year, her tutors assumed she would leave the course. \"Not only did I stay, but I got a distinction,\" she says, matter-of-factly. Three decades on, Marsh has a doctorate in engineering and a senior job at Selex ES, the international defence engineering firm, where she oversees the design of digital chips used in radar and lasers in commercial and fighter jets. Although not as scarce as a ZX81 is these days, Carol Marsh is still in a very select group. Only 8% of British engineers are women, the lowest proportion in Europe, and well behind Germany (15%), Sweden (25%) and top-performing Latvia (30%). A growing number of companies are saying this is a problem not only for them, but for all of UK manufacturing. The manufacturers' organisation EEF reports that four in five firms are struggling to fill their vacancies. \"That is because the talent pool is pretty much half of what it could be,\" the EEF's Verity O'Keefe says. \"If we are not really tackling that [gender] issue, we are going to have larger skills gaps than other industries that have done something about it, such as medicine.\" Dave Dalton, chief executive of the British Glass Association, says UK manufacturers could lose their competitive edge, as the battle for brainpower intensifies. \"I know the future is not going to be about physical endeavour; it's going to be about mental endeavour, and 50% of the population are female. Why are we not attracting that potential?\" The problem starts long before people pick a career. Too many youngsters are ditching maths and science as soon as they can, a trend especially marked for girls. Almost half of mixed state schools in England failed to enter a single girl for A-level physics. And when it comes to careers most valued by parents, engineering is right at the top \u2013 for boys. But teaching and nursing come top of parents' wish-lists for their daughters. Elena Rodr\u00edguez Falc\u00f3n, a professor of enterprise education at the University of Sheffield, thinks the problem starts in the nursery. \"Children's books are filled with social constructs: the girl is a nurse; the boy is a firefighter.\" Another storybook fable she wants to demolish is that \"engineering is a dirty, badly paid profession\". Many people misunderstand what engineering is about, she says. They associate it with car mechanics, rather than well-paid graduates designing ultrasound scanners or smartphones. Engineering and manufacturing firms have to compete with medical schools for the tiny pool of women who have done maths and science A-levels. Katrina Love, 18, from Sheffield is studying A-levels including maths and chemistry: she is just the kind of bright student they hope to attract. She had looked at doing medicine and dentistry, but says recent open days have opened her eyes to mechanical engineering. Her younger sister Sarah, 16, is thinking about an apprenticeship, but has run into scepticism: \"[People] start to question why you are doing that \u2013 why you don't do a more feminine role, like nursing.\" Julie Watson, 50, says she has seen little sexism in her 30-year career at a bottle plant in Knottingley, West Yorkshire. When she took a summer job at the plant aged 17, in 1983, she was set on a career in fashion, but discovered that \"glassmaking was in my veins\". By age 25 she was a supervisor, overseeing bottle production, at a time when most women at the plant were assembling cardboard boxes. The \"gender thing\" came up only once: when an all-male panel was considering her application for a five-year training course in glass technology and engineering. \"They asked: 'Why do you want to apply for something like this? Wouldn't you be more suited to a secretarial position?' I found myself convincing them that I could actually spray-paint my own car.\" Today she's operations director, overseeing 260 employees. She likes to invite schoolchildren into the plant, to show them how piles of grey sand are transformed into clinking bottles. O'Keefe thinks such female role models will be a big help in closing the gender gap. A decisive factor in girls' take-up of apprenticeships is whether a \"key influencer\" showed them what was possible, she says. However, it is not just attracting women into the workforce that is crucial, but keeping them. In a report last year, John Perkins, chief scientific adviser to the business department, called on employers to spend more on helping women return to work after a career break. At Selex ES, Marsh says employers should do more to help women \u2013 and men \u2013 resume careers after time out: \"Engineering is difficult to come back to because it changes so quickly. You have to retrain, and you can lose confidence.\" But can these measures make a difference before manufacturing, now reduced to just 10% of the UK economy, shrinks even further? Rodr\u00edguez Falc\u00f3n sees a link between female participation and a strong manufacturing base. \"When you are surrounded by engineering, you can very clearly see what it is and what it can do in your life,\" she says. \"Unfortunately, in the UK, industry is disappearing, slowly but surely.\"",

The ZX81, a small black box with four chips, a single kilobyte of memory and a tendency to overheat, was the first mass-market computer, and got a generation hooked on messing around with circuit boards.</p> <p>\"You could buy it as a kit. It came with instructions so I put it together. I never thought anything of it,\" she says.</p> <p>Marsh went on to become one of the first women to gain a higher national diploma in electrical and electronic engineering at Napier University, in her home city of Edinburgh. The first in her family to go to university, she fell into the world of logic gates and binary numbers, discovering \"the thrill of designing things and seeing them work\".</p> <p>When she got married in her third year, her tutors assumed she would leave the course. \"Not only did I stay, but I got a distinction,\" she says, matter-of-factly.</p> <p>Three decades on, Marsh has a doctorate in engineering and a senior job at Selex ES, the international defence engineering firm, where she oversees the design of digital chips used in radar and lasers in commercial and fighter jets.</p> <p>Although not as scarce as a ZX81 is these days, Carol Marsh is still in a very select group.

      "bodyText": "Fresh from launching an unexpected attack on power company profits, energy secretary Ed Davey has now gone on paternity leave for two weeks. That means he will miss Thursday's full-year figures from British Gas owner Centrica, but executives should not be complacent. Davey said: \"I will be getting daily updates from my office and returning for cabinet and department questions.\" Last week Davey asked regulator Ofgem to investigate whether profit margins, particularly in gas supply and particularly at British Gas, were excessive. In extremis, this could lead to a company being broken up if evidence of a monopoly is found. All this means investors have been growing nervous before Thursday's figures. Not only is political pressure increasing as households struggle with ever-rising prices, but trading is tougher than expected. It may not be obvious with the current flooding, but this winter has been fairly mild, which is not good news for British Gas if consumers keep their boilers turned down. And with customers increasingly switching suppliers to find cheaper bills, analysts believe British Gas's residential profits could be slightly below the company's target of \u00a3600m. But with overall profits expected to rise around 2% to \u00a32.8bn, this will not save Sam Laidlaw and his team from accusations of profiteering. Drax makes progress with biomass Still with energy, as the debate about future sources of supply continues, Drax is moving ahead with its transformation from a coal-fired plant to a predominantly biomass generator. Its first biomass unit opened last April, and has been producing 600MW compared with original projections of 550MW, or the 645MW from its coal-fired generators. A second unit being converted to biomass \u2013 sustainable forestry remains as well as waste such as straw and sunflower husks \u2013 is on track to start operations in the summer, with the third due sometime in 2016. Analysts will be looking for more details on progress when the company unveils figures on Tuesday. There had been concern about government-guaranteed prices for biomass power but when these were announced they were in line with Drax's expectations. However, the EU may yet get involved in regulation. The company also has to build up a supply chain of biomass products, to convince the public that it has a secure and sustainable source of generation. Meanwhile full-year earnings are expected to fall from \u00a3298m to around \u00a3224m, hit by the rising cost of carbon. Has InterContinental lost that je ne sais quoi? Paris's Le Grand hotel has a notable history. Opened in 1862 by Empress Eug\u00e9nie, wife of Napoleon III, it has hosted royalty including Tsar Nicholas II and King Edward VII, while the eponymous heroine of Emile Zola's novel Nana met her end there. For the past few decades it has been part of the InterContinental group, but analysts believe this will change within the next 12 months as the group sells its trophy assets to concentrate on brands such as Holiday Inn and Crowne Plaza. Citigroup estimates Le Grand could be worth $400m, while the group's Hong Kong InterContinental, also believed to be on the block, is valued at $600m. InterContinental has already announced the disposal of 80% of its New York Barclay hotel, and the City is hoping that money will soon be returned to shareholders. Analysts at Barclays believe the group could be planning a $300m buyback, with an announcement possible at next Tuesday's full-year results. As for the figures themselves, Barclays is forecasting an increase in profits from $560m to $585m. But the fourth quarter is likely to have been hit by the US government shutdown, and while business is expected to have recovered, the City still has concerns about future growth in what is a key market for the group. \u2022 This article was amended on 17 February 2014 to correct a mistake about the expected profits to be made by British Gas.",
