The number of people visiting shops in March dropped 6% compared with the same month last year after strong winds and snow hit the UK. A survey of Visa card users indicated that consumer spending slid 2% in March, rounding off a poor start to the year for the retail sector. \u201cThe severe weather put paid to any glimmer of hope for an uplift in shopper activity in March,\u201d said Diane Wehrle, a director at Springboard, which compiled the footfall data. \u201cA proportion of this was made up over Easter, with footfall in shopping centres and retail parks rising from last Easter. but this was more than offset by the impact of the heavy rain on high streets.\u201d High streets were the hardest hit, with visitor numbers down 8.6%, but shopping centres and retail parks also experienced declines, of 4.8% and 1.8% respectively, according to Springboard. The drop was particularly marked as this year\u2019s chilly March was set against balmy conditions a year ago when temperatures rivalled holiday hotspots such as Mallorca and Ibiza. But Mark Antipof, chief commercial officer at Visa, which accounts for \u00a31 in every \u00a33 spent in the UK, said the bad weather did not entirely explain the lacklustre spending in March. \u201cWe are in the midst of a dip in consumer confidence and this \u2013 coupled with other economic factors \u2013 is causing shoppers to continue to restrain themselves,\u201d Antipof said. \u201cHigh street sales suffered once again; however, it is also noteworthy that e-commerce spend fell for the first time in 10 months, and by its fastest rate since 2012.\u201d Online sales fell 1.2% in March compared with a 0.3% rise in February, while face-to-face transactions slid 3% versus a 2.4% dip in the previous month according to Visa, whose data forms the basis of a UK consumer spending index compiled by IHS Markit. The difficult conditions will pile pressure on retailers already suffering from rising costs and consumers\u2019 caution in the face of food price inflation and a squeeze on their spare cash. Big names including Toys R Us and Bargain Booze owner Conviviality have fallen into administration, while New Look and Carpetright are closing dozens of stores in order to restructure.

Brexit-fuelled inflation and a rise in business rates has made life tougher, just as the industry is battling to adapt to a switch to shopping online and a preference for spending on experiences such as holidays or meals out. Annabel Fiddes, principal economist at IHS Markit, said the outlook remained difficult. \u201cWhile we could expect to see a relative improvement in the numbers next month as weather conditions normalise, the underlying trend remains relatively weak as recent data, including PMI [purchasing manager\u2019s index] surveys, show signs of a slowdown.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Whitbread is under mounting pressure from hedge funds to break up its business by spinning off the Costa Coffee chain, after activist investor Elliott Advisors built up a stake of more than 6%. The US hedge fund said in a statement on Saturday that it has become the largest investor in Whitbread, which started out as a brewing business but now owns Costa, Britain\u2019s biggest coffee outlet, and Premier Inn, the country\u2019s biggest budget hotel company. Elliott joins Sachem Head, another US hedge fund, which owns 3.4% of the FTSE 100 company, in pushing for a demerger of Costa. Elliott believes the 2,400-strong coffee shop chain and Premier Inn are two very distinct businesses with little overlap and that \u00a33bn of value could be created by splitting off Costa. Whitbread shares have underperformed the wider stock market in recent years. However, unlike Sachem Head, Elliott is not pushing for a sale and leaseback deal on the hotel properties and more share buybacks. Its sole strategic aim is to split off Costa. Whitbread declined to comment. Alison Brittain, Whitbread\u2019s chief executive, has said the group is open-minded about its structure but has also warned against moving too quickly to break up the company. The idea is not new, because other investors and City analysts have repeatedly suggested that Whitbread should spin off its popular Costa chain. But Elliott has a reputation for pursuing its goals more aggressively than other investors. Whitbread\u2019s history dates back to 1742, and it listed on the London Stock Exchange on 1948. The company grew into a sprawling leisure empire that included Beefeater, TGI Fridays and Pizza Hut restaurants along with David Lloyd Leisure gyms and Marriott Hotels. Most of these brands and the brewing operations have been sold, leaving Whitbread to focus on Costa and Premier Inn as well as the Beefeater and Brewers Fayre restaurant chains. Today, the company has a market value of \u00a37.2bn and employs 50,000 people. Costa was acquired in 1995 from Sergio and Bruno Costa, who founded the chain in London in 1971. Costa has about 2,400 stores and 7,100 Express machines in the UK. The chain is being rolled out in China, while Premier Inn is expanding in Germany. The budget hotel chain is attracting increasing numbers of business travellers, who now make up half its customers. In its latest update, Whitbread unveiled a 1.5% fall in like-for-like sales at its Costa high street outlets and warned consumer demand would remain subdued \u2013 but Brittain insisted this did not spell the end of the coffee shop boom.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The government\u2019s failure to take action on insulating draughty homes has been criticised by the statutory body for energy consumers. As millions of households brace for another round of energy bill rises after British Gas and EDF Energy hiked their prices, Citizens Advice said silence by ministers on energy efficiency plans would mean consumers lost out and insulation installers would go bust. Zoe Guijarro, policy manager at the consumer group, told the Guardian: \u201cI think it\u2019s hugely damaging because we\u2019ll have a lot of catchup to do. In the meantime we will have lost a lot of installers, who will have gone out of business \u2013 a lot of expertise. It\u2019s not a shame \u2013 it\u2019s shocking in this day and age, really.\u201d The government axed its flagship energy efficiency scheme in 2015 and has yet to replace it or signal what might come next. Guijarro said the black hole on policy could lead people to conclude energy efficiency is unimportant, even though experts view it as vital for cutting bills and carbon emissions. \u201cYou have this whole radio silence, this missed opportunity where you could absolutely have that narrative around health and wellbeing, and benefits of having a warmer, healthier home. And the longer it goes on the more people think it\u2019s not important,\u201d Guijaro said. The comments by Citizens Advice follow the government coming under fire for downgrading targets for insulating older homes with solid walls. The University of Exeter said the move meant it would take more than 400 years to upgrade the UK\u2019s last uninsulated solid wall homes. E.ON told the Guardian that the change could also restrict the help that vulnerable households received, and make the solid wall target more challenging to hit. The big-six energy supplier said a serious energy efficiency plan would help consumers more than a price cap, which it has vigorously opposed. \u201cOverall, as a country we need to bring the energy efficiency of homes up to the level that is right for the 21st century, and which could save many hundreds of pounds off the annual energy bill. This is a far more sustainable policy, which politicians should consider embracing as opposed to implementing a temporary market-wide price cap,\u201d the company said. A spokesperson for the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) said: \u201cWe are investing \u00a36bn into making homes more energy efficient, including schemes to provide insulation, as well as a further \u00a3320m to enable consumers and non-domestic users to participate in a trailblazing heat networks scheme.\u201d Industry and government are mulling how to reduce the climate change impact from heating, with energy efficiency considered a \u201cno regrets\u201d option. The UK\u2019s homes and businesses are overwhelmingly heated by fossil fuels, mostly gas. Energy UK, the big-six lobby group, last week urged the government to fund trials of low-CO2 alternatives, such as greener gases including hydrogen, heat pumps running off renewable electricity and local heat networks. But experts said the switch to greener heat would not be as simple as the transition to low-CO2 power, which accounted for half of UK electricity supplied last year. Mike Hemsley, senior power analyst at the government\u2019s climate advisers, the Committee on Climate Change, said: \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of barriers to installing efficiency and low-carbon heat.\u201d He added that it was also not clear yet whether there was a low-CO2 option that was cheaper than today\u2019s heating systems. The government\u2019s experts seem to share that view. A report published on Friday by BEIS concluded there was a large degree of uncertainty over the best way to decarbonise heat, given limited information on the feasibility of the technologies, their cost and whether consumers would accept them.",

This is a far more sustainable policy, which politicians should consider embracing as opposed to implementing a temporary market-wide price cap,\u201d the company said.</p> <p>A spokesperson for the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) said: \u201cWe are investing \u00a36bn into making homes more energy efficient, including schemes to provide insulation, as well as a further \u00a3320m to enable consumers and non-domestic users to participate in a trailblazing heat networks scheme.\u201d</p> <p>Industry and government are mulling how to reduce the climate change impact from heating, with energy efficiency considered a \u201cno regrets\u201d option.</p> <p>The UK\u2019s homes and businesses are overwhelmingly heated by fossil fuels, mostly gas. Energy UK, the big-six lobby group, last week <a href=\"https://www.energy-uk.org.uk/publication.html?task=file.download&amp;id=6609\">urged</a> the government to fund trials of low-CO<sub>2</sub> alternatives, such as greener gases including hydrogen, heat pumps running off renewable electricity and local heat networks.</p> <p>But experts said the switch to greener heat would not be as simple as the transition to low-CO<sub>2</sub> power, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/mar/29/wind-and-solar-made-more-electricity-than-nuclear-for-first-time-in-uk\">which accounted for half of UK electricity supplied last year</a>.</p> <p>Mike Hemsley, senior power analyst at the government\u2019s climate advisers, the Committee on Climate Change, said: \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of barriers to installing efficiency and low-carbon heat.\u201d </p> <p>He added that it was also not clear yet whether there was a low-CO<sub>2</sub> option that was cheaper than today\u2019s heating systems.</p> <p>The government\u2019s experts seem to share that view. <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/699678/Final_BEIS_low_carbon_gas_070318_clean-STC.pdf\">A report published on Friday</a> by BEIS concluded there was a large degree of uncertainty over the best way to decarbonise heat, given limited information on the feasibility of the technologies, their cost and whether consumers would accept them.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Sir Martin Sorrell is in line for almost \u00a320m in payouts from WPP over the next five years, as part of the deal struck to leave the advertising group he founded more than three decades ago. The departure of Sorrell, who resigned on Saturday before learning the findings of an internal investigation into alleged personal misconduct, is also being viewed as a potential catalyst for a breakup of WPP. The world\u2019s largest advertising group said its founder and chief executive would be treated as having retired from the company. This means Sorrell will be eligible to receive payouts related to 1.6m shares in a number of award plans that will vest over the next five years. The exact value depends on the company\u2019s performance. At WPP\u2019s current share price of \u00a312 the awards are worth about \u00a319m. WPP has said the investigation into Sorrell, 73, who rejected the allegation of misconduct \u201cunreservedly\u201d, has concluded. The law firm in charge of the investigation, WilmerHale, was due to deliver its findings to the board by next Friday but details of the misconduct allegation and the outcome of the probe will not be made public. The allegations are the improper use of company funds, and improper personal behaviour. Sorrell\u2019s final full-year pay as chief executive for 2017 will be made public when WPP publishes its annual report in about a month. He is thought to be receiving between \u00a313m and \u00a315m, the lower end of a maximum of \u00a319m he could have earned due to the company reporting its worst performance since 2009. Sorrell is one of the UK\u2019s best-paid business leaders, earning more than \u00a3200m from pay and lucrative \u2013 and highly controversial \u2013 reward schemes in the past five years alone. His \u00a370m payout in 2015, was one of the biggest in UK corporate history. Sorrell and his family trust also own a stake of about 1.8% in WPP, worth about \u00a3250m. In an email to staff, Sorrell wrote: \u201cI shall miss all of you greatly. As a founder, I can say that WPP is not just a matter of life or death, it was, is and will be more important than that.\u201d To fill the leadership vacuum while a successor is found, Roberto Quarta, the WPP chairman, will take on the role of executive chairman. In addition, Mark Read, the chief executive of Wunderman and WPP Digital, and Andrew Scott, a top executive at WPP\u2019s European operation, have been appointed chief operating officers. This would make them the frontrunning internal candidates to take over from Sorrell, as the board also readies to reach out to its \u201cconstantly refined list of external candidates\u201d. \u201cThe succession arrangements look like a sticking plaster and, until strong and credible long-term leadership arrangements emerge, there will be concerns about the sustainability of the WPP Group, as we know it today, and its strategic direction,\u201d said Guy Jubb, former global head of governance and stewardship at Standard Life Investments, an investor in WPP. Analysts believe Sorrell\u2019s departure combined with a share price slump of almost a third over the past year means investors and the WPP board will have to consider that there is potentially more value in breaking up WPP. \u201cThe question to Quarta is how do we create shareholder value from this position. I think most analysts and investors when adding up the sum of the parts of WPP would answer that it is to break it up,\u201d said Alex DeGroote, an analyst with Cenkos Securities. The company\u2019s board is already running the rule over whether it should explore a sale of Kantar, its market research arm, which could be worth \u00a33bn. Beyond its marketing services and PR operations \u2013 of which WPP\u2019s global media agency powerhouses such as MediaCom have been the engine of its profits and revenue growth \u2013 DeGroote says there is a \u201ctreasure trove of hidden value\u201d on WPP\u2019s balance sheet worth billions of pounds that is not reflected in its core profits. He estimates there is \u00a31bn of property and \u00a31.1bn of equity investments in companies including Vice, digital firm AppNexus, measurement company comScore and advertising group Chime.",

      "bodyText": "Stronger trade unions, improved regional policy and an end to austerity should form part of a plan to return growth in living standards to its pre-crisis levels, according to a leading leftwing thinktank. Calling for a fairer tax system and a less flexible labour market, the Fabian Society said a comprehensive strategy was required to boost household incomes. Three Labour MPs \u2013 the shadow Treasury minister, Anneliese Dodds, the shadow industry minister, Chi Onwurah, and Rachel Reeves, the chair of the Commons business committee \u2013 contributed to the report, Raising the Bar. Andrew Harrop, the general secretary of the Fabian Society and the report\u2019s editor, said: \u201cWe should judge our economy by the pace at which ordinary household incomes rise because the point of economic growth is to place prosperity into the hands of the people. Against this benchmark, the UK\u2019s recent economic record is truly terrible with the living standards of working-age households only just higher today than in 2007. Raising the Bar challenges the fatalism of our economic policy-makers and sets out a comprehensive six-point plan to get family incomes to grow the way they used to.\u201d Harrop added that for decades in the run-up to the 2008 financial crisis, real family incomes grew by 2% a year. \u201cEarnings are not expected to return to pre-crisis levels until the 2020s and planned cuts to social security will further reduce the living standards of low and middle-income households. Yet policy-makers behave as if nothing can be done.\u201d The Fabian six-point plan involves: A more stimulative monetary and fiscal policy, with an end to austerity, increased public investment and a cautious approach to raising interest rates. Tighter regulation of zero-hour jobs, a broader and more generous minimum wage, and a redesign of universal credit to make work pay for mothers. Increased powers for trade unions. Devolving strong economic powers to local and regional authorities, and encouragement for public bodies to spend locally. An industrial strategy focused on boosting R&amp;D, targets to promote green technology, and an emphasis on \u201ceveryday jobs\u201d. Higher taxes for rich individuals and large corporations but an end to social security cuts. Geoff Tily, a senior economist at the TUC, the umbrella body for British trade unions, said the public spending cuts since 2010 had not only damaged the public realm, but had also sucked out demand from the economy, leading to weaker growth, and lower earnings and household incomes. Higher hourly earnings and higher productivity now depended on raising demand, he said. He added: \u201cThe attacks on public sector wages and public sector services were not only unjust, but also macroeconomically unsound. Reversing cuts should strengthen the private economy, permit wage increases and ultimately restore family incomes (as well as boosting government revenues and so repairing public sector finances). A more reasoned assessment of demand, and hence recognition of more spare capacity than currently understood, should also reduce the chance of interest rate rises.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>Stronger trade unions, improved regional policy and an end to austerity should form part of a plan to return growth in living standards to its pre-crisis levels, according to a leading leftwing thinktank.</p> <p>Calling for a fairer tax system and a less flexible labour market, the Fabian Society said a comprehensive strategy was required to boost household incomes.</p> <p>Three Labour MPs \u2013 the shadow Treasury minister, Anneliese Dodds, the shadow industry minister, Chi Onwurah, and Rachel Reeves, the chair of the Commons business committee \u2013 contributed to the report, <a href=\"https://fabians.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/FABJ5958-Economics-Pamphlet-180327-WEB.pdf\">Raising the Bar.</a></p> <p>Andrew Harrop, the general secretary of the Fabian Society and the report\u2019s editor, said: \u201cWe should judge our economy by the pace at which ordinary household incomes rise because the point of economic growth is to place prosperity into the hands of the people. </p> <p>Against this benchmark, the UK\u2019s recent economic record is truly terrible with the living standards of working-age households only just higher today than in 2007. Raising the Bar challenges the fatalism of our economic policy-makers and sets out a comprehensive six-point plan to get family incomes to grow the way they used to.\u201d<br></p> <p>Harrop added that for decades in the run-up to the 2008 financial crisis, real family incomes grew by 2% a year. \u201cEarnings are not expected to return to pre-crisis levels until the 2020s and planned cuts to social security will further reduce the living standards of low and middle-income households. Yet policy-makers behave as if nothing can be done.\u201d</p> <p>The Fabian six-point plan involves:</p> <ul> <li>A more stimulative monetary and fiscal policy, with an end to austerity, increased public investment and a cautious approach to raising interest rates.</li> <li>Tighter regulation of zero-hour jobs, a broader and more generous minimum wage, and a redesign of universal credit to make work pay for mothers.</li> <li>Increased powers for trade unions.</li> <li>Devolving strong economic powers to local and regional authorities, and encouragement for public bodies to spend locally.</li> <li>An industrial strategy focused on boosting R&amp;D, targets to promote green technology, and an emphasis on \u201ceveryday jobs\u201d.</li> <li>Higher taxes for rich individuals and large corporations but an end to social security cuts.</li> </ul> <p>Geoff Tily, a senior economist at the TUC, the umbrella body for British trade unions, said the public spending cuts since 2010 had not only damaged the public realm, but had also sucked out demand from the economy, leading to weaker growth, and lower earnings and household incomes. Higher hourly earnings and higher productivity now depended on raising demand, he said. </p> <p>He added: \u201cThe attacks on public sector wages and public sector services were not only unjust, but also macroeconomically unsound. Reversing cuts should strengthen the private economy, permit wage increases and ultimately restore family incomes (as well as boosting government revenues and so repairing public sector finances). A more reasoned assessment of demand, and hence recognition of more spare capacity than currently understood, should also reduce the chance of interest rate rises.\u201d</p>",

The billionaire owner of Topshop and Miss Selfridge said he was \u201csad\u201d he had not received recognition for paying \u00a3363m into the BHS pension scheme last year, in a move that headed off the threat of him losing his knighthood. Asked in an interview with the Mail on Sunday if any of the BHS furore was his fault, he said: \u201cNo. Zero. Nothing.\u201d Green owned BHS for 15 years before selling it to serial bankrupt Dominic Chappell for \u00a31 in 2015 \u2013 a year before the retailer collapsed with the loss of 11,000 jobs. Green and other investors were paid \u00a3586m in dividends, rent and interest during their ownership of the retailer. Referring to BHS, Green added: \u201cWe didn\u2019t go as a vulture and bankrupt it, try to keep it all to ourselves. That was the stupidity. Trying to do it the correct way turned out to be a disaster.\u201d Claiming that he spent \u00a335m on the legal bill alone for dealing with the BHS collapse, he said: \u201cMy family lost millions on BHS.\u201d He added: \u201cI and our board were wholly misled by everyone involved with [Chappell]. Was it the worst mistake of my life? Yes, it was. Horrible. Ugly.\u201d Following a parliamentary investigation into the BHS collapse, the businessman was labelled by MPs the \u201cunacceptable face of capitalism\u201d and accused of the \u201csystematic plunder\u201d of the company, along with Chappell and their \u201changers-on\u201d. Under pressure from the Pensions Regulator, Green agreed to pay \u00a3363m into the BHS pension scheme in February 2017 to help plug its \u00a3571m black hole. He feels he deserves more credit for this. \u201cI wrote a cheque for \u00a3363m,\u201d he told the Mail on Sunday. \u201cBut nobody has ever said, this man behaved like a gentleman, his family behaved properly. I\u2019m not doing this as an act for you because you know it\u2019s not my style \u2013 but I\u2019m sad that there\u2019s no acceptance of that.\u201d He added: \u201cFortunately, we were able to pay and rectify it. I was pleased we were able to resolve it.\u201d Green questioned whether antisemitism played a role in the accusations. \u201cDo I think the viciousness has anything to do with the fact that I am a Jewish businessman? Well, I\u2019m not going to say. The answer is I don\u2019t want to get into it.\u201d He came under fire for cruising the Mediterranean in his wife Tina\u2019s \u00a3100m yacht Lionheart in the summer after the BHS collapse while BHS pensioners worried about their future. His wife is also the legal owner of Green\u2019s business empire (since 2004). The couple\u2019s lavish lifestyle has frequently drawn criticism. Green defended his lifestyle, saying it was the result of his business successes. \u201cI feel like I\u2019ve got to justify I had the ability to pay, that my family has got a yacht, that I\u2019m living a nice lifestyle. Thank goodness, along my journey, I was very successful and therefore I was able to pay.\u201d He did not accept the yacht was extravagant. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s grand living [on the yacht], I\u2019m sorry. You\u2019re saying I have been successful and I should have to apologise for that?\u201d Green also accused Frank Field, the chair of the work and pensions committee that led the investigation into BHS, of a personal vendetta. The Pensions Regulator\u2019s report showed he had made a number of earlier offers before a final deal was reached, but Green\u2019s view is that Field \u201charassed the Pension Regulator\u201d and that this delayed the payment, according to the Mail on Sunday. The collapse of BHS in April 2016 was one of Britain\u2019s biggest business scandals and led to calls from MPs that Green should be stripped of his knighthood. Unlike Chappell, Green escaped a ban from serving as a company director by the Insolvency Service last month.",

      "bodyText": "You can\u2019t buck the market. The turn to the right taken by politics from the mid-1970s onwards was summed up in one phrase coined by Margaret Thatcher in 1988. This idea tended to be associated with liberal economists such as Milton Friedman and Friedrich Hayek, both of whom influenced Thatcher deeply. Both thought that left to their own devices buyers and sellers would work out the price for everything, be that a loaf of bread, a wage, or an operation in the health service. But economists and politicians who would certainly not have classified themselves as Hayekians, Friedmanites or Thatcherites also found the idea of market forces hard to resist. The new Keynesian school believed that there might be short-term impediments \u2013 or stickiness in the jargon \u2013 and that it was the job of government to deal with these market failures. But in the long term they too thought markets would return to equilibrium. All sorts of policies flowed from this core belief: from privatisation to curbs on trade unions; from cuts in welfare to the attempt to create an internal market in the NHS. It also justified removing constraints on capital and the hands-off approach to financial regulation in the years leading up to the banking crisis of 2008. Anybody who suggested a gigantic bubble was being inflated was told that in free markets operated by perfectly rational economic agents this could not possibly happen. Then the financial markets froze up. This was a classic emperor\u2019s new clothes moment, when the public realised that the economics profession did not really have the foggiest idea that the biggest financial crisis in a century had been looming. Like a doctor who had said a patient was in rude health when she was actually suffering from a life-threatening disease, it had failed when it was most needed. Just before Christmas, I wrote a column supporting the idea for some new thinking in economics. It caused quite a stir. Some economists liked it. Others hated it and rushed to their profession\u2019s defence. My piece said there was a need for a more plural approach to economics, with the need for a challenge to the dominant neo-classical school as a result of its egregious failure in 2008. The argument was that a bit of competition would do economics good. If the latest edition of the magazine Prospect is anything to go by, a debate is now well under way. Howard Reed, an economist who has worked for two of the UK\u2019s leading thinktanks, the Institute for Public Policy Research and the Institute for Fiscal Studies, says the malaise is so serious that a \u201cdeconomics\u201d is needed that \u201cdecontaminates the discipline, deconstructs its theoretical heart, and rebuilds from first principles\u201d. Reed says a retooled economics would have four features. Firstly, recognition that there is no such thing as a value-free analysis of the economy. Neo-classical economics purports to be clean and pure but uses a cloak of ethical neutrality to make an an individualistic ethos the norm. Secondly, he says too much economics is about how humans ought to behave rather than how they actually behave. Thirdly, economics needs to focus on the good life rather than on those areas most susceptible to analysis through 19th century linear mathematics. Finally, he calls for a more pluralistic approach. Economics should be learning from other disciplines rather than colonising them. Prospect gave Diane Coyle, a Cambridge University economics professor, the right to reply to Reed\u2019s piece and she does so with relish, calling it lamentable, a caricature and an ill-informed diatribe. Most modern economics involves empirical testing, Coyle says, often using new sources of data. She rejects the idea that the profession is stuck in an ivory tower fiddling around with abstruse mathematics while ignoring the real world. Rather, it is \u201caddressing questions of immediate importance and relevance to policymakers, citizens and businesses\u201d. Nor is it true that the discipline requires that people be rational, calculating automatons. \u201cIt very often has people interacting with each other rather than acting as atomistic individuals, despite Reed\u2019s charge.\u201d Coyle accepts that macro-economics \u2013 the big picture stuff that involves looking at the economy in the round \u2013 is in a troubled state but says this is actually only a minority field. The point that there are many economists doing interesting things in areas such as behavioural economics is a fair one, but Coyle is on shakier ground when she skates over the problems in macro-economics. It was after all, macro-economists \u2013 the people working at the International Monetary Fund, the Federal Reserve, the European Central Bank, the Bank of England \u2013 that the public relied on to get things right a decade ago. All were blind to what was going on, and that had quite a lot to do with their \u201cmarkets tend to know best\u201d belief system. Policy makers did not find the works of Hayek and Friedman particularly useful when a second great depression was looming. Instead, they turned, if only fleetingly, to Keynes\u2019s general theory, which told them it would not be wise to wait for market forces to do their work. Reed\u2019s argument is not just that blind faith in neo-classical economics led to the crisis. Nor is it simply that the systemic failure of 2008 means there is a need for a root-and-branch rethink. It is also that mainstream economics has been serving the interests of the political right. Some in the profession, particularly those who see themselves as progressives, appear to have trouble with this idea. That perhaps explains why they have been so rattled by even the teeniest bit of criticism.",

It also justified removing constraints on capital and the hands-off approach to financial regulation in the years leading up to the banking crisis of 2008. Anybody who suggested a gigantic bubble was being inflated was told that in free markets operated by perfectly rational economic agents this could not possibly happen.</p> <p>Then the financial markets froze up. This was a classic emperor\u2019s new clothes moment, when the public realised that the economics profession did not really have the foggiest idea that the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/may/11/after-crash-need-revolution-in-economics-teaching-chang-aldred\">biggest financial crisis in a century had been looming</a>. Like a doctor who had said a patient was in rude health when she was actually suffering from a life-threatening disease, it had failed when it was most needed.</p> <p>Just before Christmas, I wrote a column supporting <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/dec/17/heretics-welcome-economics-needs-a-new-reformation\">the idea for some new thinking in economics</a>. It caused quite a stir. Some economists liked it. Others hated it and rushed to their profession\u2019s defence.</p> <p>My piece said there was a need for a more plural approach to economics, with the need for a challenge to the dominant neo-classical school as a result of its egregious failure in 2008. The argument was that a bit of competition would do economics good.</p> <p>If the latest edition of the magazine Prospect is anything to go by, a debate is now well under way. Howard Reed, an economist who has worked for two of the UK\u2019s leading thinktanks, the Institute for Public Policy Research and the Institute for Fiscal Studies, <a href=\"https://www.prospectmagazine.co.uk/economics-and-finance/the-case-for-a-new-economics\">says the malaise is so serious </a>that a \u201cdeconomics\u201d is needed that \u201cdecontaminates the discipline, deconstructs its theoretical heart, and rebuilds from first principles\u201d.</p> <p>Reed says a retooled economics would have four features. Firstly, recognition that there is no such thing as a value-free analysis of the economy. Neo-classical economics purports to be clean and pure but uses a cloak of ethical neutrality to make an an individualistic ethos the norm.</p> <p>Secondly, he says too much economics is about how humans ought to behave rather than how they actually behave. Thirdly, economics needs to focus on the good life rather than on those areas most susceptible to analysis through 19th century linear mathematics. Finally, he calls for a more pluralistic approach. Economics should be learning from other disciplines rather than colonising them.</p> <p>Prospect gave Diane Coyle, a Cambridge University economics professor, <a href=\"https://www.prospectmagazine.co.uk/economics-and-finance/dianecoyle\">the right to reply</a> to Reed\u2019s piece and she does so with relish, calling it lamentable, a caricature and an ill-informed diatribe.</p> <p>Most modern economics involves empirical testing, Coyle says, often using new sources of data. She rejects the idea that the profession is stuck in an ivory tower fiddling around with abstruse mathematics while ignoring the real world. Rather, it is \u201caddressing questions of immediate importance and relevance to policymakers, citizens and businesses\u201d.</p> <p>Nor is it true that the discipline requires that people be rational, calculating automatons. \u201cIt very often has people interacting with each other rather than acting as atomistic individuals, despite Reed\u2019s charge.\u201d <br></p> <p>Coyle accepts that macro-economics \u2013 the big picture stuff that involves looking at the economy in the round \u2013 is in a troubled state but says this is actually only a minority field.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Guardian business email sign-up\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/3887\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for Business Today\" data-form-description=\"Get the headlines and editors' picks every weekday morning.\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk</figcaption> </figure>  <p>The point that there are many economists doing interesting things in areas such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/oct/09/what-is-behavioural-economics-richard-thaler-nobel-prize\">behavioural economics</a> is a fair one, but Coyle is on shakier ground when she skates over the problems in macro-economics.</p> <p>It was after all, macro-economists \u2013 the people working at the International Monetary Fund, the Federal Reserve, the European Central Bank, the Bank of England \u2013 that the public relied on to get things right a decade ago. All were blind to what was going on, and that had quite a lot to do with their \u201cmarkets tend to know best\u201d belief system.</p> <p>Policy makers did not find the works of Hayek and Friedman particularly useful when a second great depression was looming. Instead, they turned, if only fleetingly, to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/dec/11/keynesian-economics-is-it-time-for-the-theory-to-rise-from-the-dead\">Keynes\u2019s general theory</a>, which told them it would not be wise to wait for market forces to do their work. <br></p> <p>Reed\u2019s argument is not just that blind faith in neo-classical economics led to the crisis. Nor is it simply that the systemic failure of 2008 means there is a need for a root-and-branch rethink. It is also that mainstream economics has been serving the interests of the political right.</p> <p>Some in the profession, particularly those who see themselves as progressives, appear to have trouble with this idea. That perhaps explains why they have been so rattled by even the teeniest bit of criticism. <br></p>",

      "bodyText": "Russian oligarchs, the rouble and the Moscow stock market all felt the pain of US sanctions last week. The share price slumps at Oleg Deripaska\u2019s En+ and Rusal companies, the steepest daily fall in the national currency for three years, and a double-digit hit to the dollar-denominated RTS index all showed that it is possible to punish Vladimir Putin and his associates. But the international community needs to be vigilant. At the same time that US sanctions were wiping billions of pounds off the value of Russian companies, Russia\u2019s president was preparing a consolatory gift to sugar the pill. The Kremlin has, according to multiple reports, drawn up plans for two new domestic tax havens aimed at Russian millionaires and billionaires who may be considering whether to repatriate their wealth and take shelter from tit-for-tat sanctions. Amid this manoeuvring, the big question for Theresa May, as the UK considers its own toolkit of measures, is whether sanctions will cause genuine discomfort to the Kremlin. Some informed observers say knocking a few billion off the personal wealth off an oligarch class that few ordinary Russians have any love for will not play too badly for Putin, even if it is ordinary workers who end up losing their jobs. It is also unclear why some oligarchs are deemed to be worthy of sanctions by virtue of their closeness to the Kremlin, but others are not. Why target the owner of an aluminium giant, which competes with US industry, but not the owner of a football club, which does not? London\u2019s position as a playground for Russia\u2019s elite means the opportunities available to May are more subtle. The so-called Magnitsky measures, named after the anti-corruption whistleblower who met his death in a Russian jail, could be used to bar suspect figures from entering the UK. Some politicians, notably the Liberal Democrat leader and former business minister Vince Cable, have suggested deploying new unexplained wealth orders, introduced in February. These could be used to force people suspected of using dirty money to buy stately homes and Kensington townhouses to explain where they got the cash. Russian figures with ties to the Putin regime own British properties worth nearly \u00a31.1bn, according to recent estimates, most of it in London. The true value is likely to be far greater because buyers can take advantage of offshore secrecy loopholes left open under May. That\u2019s one reason why Labour has asked for British overseas territories to be forced to disclose the ownership of offshore companies more quickly than the current deadline of 2021. Any or all of these measures would hurt individuals with at least some influence in various corners of Russia\u2019s labyrinthine political corridors. But the big question mark hanging over the path ahead is whether the City of London\u2019s lobbying heft will ultimately prove telling. Russian oligarchs\u2019 business is highly lucrative for lawyers and investment bankers. One major bank in the City is said to have a team of more than 20 people dedicated to managing $1bn on behalf of a well-known oligarch. Britain\u2019s oil giant BP derives a huge slice of its income from its stake in Moscow-based Rosneft. The economic uncertainty of Brexit has raised fears that the capital\u2019s standing as a financial centre could be on the wane. With the government keen to prevent the feared decline \u2013 and the concomitant impact on tax revenue \u2013 the City\u2019s bargaining power is substantial. The financial industry can argue that being seen to reject Russian cash would simply see the money diverted elsewhere and spook other foreign investors, who fear the murkiest corners of their wealth may no longer be safe in London. That is a practical approach but not a moral one. Money will always follow the path of least resistance and it is not clear that the UK has the stomach to offer any at all. Streaming puts song in heart of music biz With UK record labels enjoying the biggest growth surge in revenues in more than two decades, the music industry has finally put the once-looming threat of a piracy apocalypse behind it. Digital formats have moved from being the industry\u2019s bete noire to its saviour: royalties from subscriptions to streaming services underpinned record growth last year. A 10.6% rise in record-label earnings, to \u00a3839m, came thanks to a 45% increase to \u00a3347m in income from services such as Spotify, Apple Music and Amazon Music. Income from CD sales, formerly the cornerstone of the music money-making machine, remained almost flat at \u00a3246m. The digital revolution has fuelled a democratisation of the industry, opening up the opportunity for fans to discover more of the \u201clong tail\u201d of artists \u2013 those beyond the traditional radio-dominating stars such as Taylor Swift, Adele and the ubiquitous Ed Sheeran. While more artists are sharing in the new digital bonanza, they are all having to get used to the idea that it is much harder to make money out of music than it used to be. The industry may be recovering, but it is still only worth two-thirds of what it was in 2001, the days of peak CD. Profit margins on CDs were a licence to print money: digital streaming royalties per track, not so much. And that is without starting on the music industry\u2019s unhappiness with YouTube paying a pittance for the hundreds of millions of music videos viewed on its site each year. The few million vinyl records sold provide more royalty income to artists than YouTube does. The profits of live music have never changed, hence the resurgence in popularity of touring to top up artists\u2019 bank accounts. Yet with Spotify\u2019s well-received $30bn stock-market listing, and Amazon reigniting the popularity of streaming music at home with its Echo smart speakers, digital income looks set to remain top of the pops. Uber\u2019s bikes are not a sign of back-pedalling Uber\u2019s acquisition of US bike-hire firm Jump looks rather pedestrian by the standards of its own vaulting ambition, at least at first glance. Compared to moonshot ideas such as cars that can fly \u2013 or the more tangible advance of driverless taxis \u2013 Jump\u2019s electric \u201cpedal-assisted\u201d bikes might as well be Victorian-era penny-farthings. But the deal should not be seen in isolation. Uber does not need electric bikes to become the commuter\u2019s carriage of choice for the acquisition to make sense. Rather, it envisages a world in which most City-dwellers will have no need to own their own car, with an alternative available for any given journey. The Uber user of 2038 might hop into a driverless taxi to get to work, whizz round the corner for lunch on an electric bike, then impress their date by whisking them off for dinner in a flying limousine. Fanciful as that might be, the goal for Uber is not to hit every imaginable futuristic milestone. Instead, it is to have a foot in the door of whatever technological advances gain the most traction. This attitude is born of a mindset akin to that of the San Francisco firm\u2019s near neighbours in Silicon Valley, even if Uber\u2019s bread and butter is a rather less glamorous mobile-phone-based taxi service. Unlike longstanding industries that have developed amid fierce competition and political opposition to monopolies, the likes of Facebook and Google emerged so quickly that, for them, world domination seems almost the natural order of things. That isn\u2019t to say that Uber, which is no stranger to regulatory resistance, will be allowed to lock competitors out of a sector as vast as transport. But it is already ubiquitous in much of the world, its name synonymous with what it does, much like Hoover in the UK or Xerox in the US. Coupled with its speculative investment in multiple modes of transport, that gives it a huge head start in the race towards the future.",

      "bodyText": "Back in the 1990s, the share-trading website E*Trade used to run a television advert featuring a cocky young financial adviser counselling a grey-haired client. \u201cYou have a retirement plan?\u201d the client asks. \u201cOh sure,\u201d says his adviser. \u201cInvest, get rich, retire at 45.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m 58,\u201d responds the client. \u201cOh!\u201d says the broker. \u201cYour retirement plan.\u201d As a satirical take on the self-serving fund management sector \u2013 which may seem dull but facilitates important stuff such as saving for old age \u2013 that just about sums everything up. The industry has always seemed to represent the City\u2019s closest point to embracing Marxism, in that it often appears to exist mainly for the benefit of its workers. Fund managers trouser fortunes even when they are diminishing your nest-egg. Last year, a study of actively managed UK equity funds found that nine out of 10 underperformed the market \u2013 which is a bit like being paid to get to win the race to the airport departure gate, stepping on a travelator and then arriving after everyone else. But better than the stats are the actual examples of the City\u2019s humiliating inability to pick winners. A few years ago, the Sun newspaper ran a share-tipping competition pitting 100 readers against a bunch of City experts, the office cat and a Page 3 model. No one was surprised when the model won and a City trader came 60th (although the cat was presumably gutted at only being placed 41st). But the episode illustrates how the fund-management industry has been a laughing stock for aeons. So long, in fact, that even the Financial Conduct Authority has noticed. Earlier this month the City regulator outlined a series of new rules for the industry, including such startling requirements as fund managers having to make an \u201cannual assessment of value\u201d as part of their duty to act in the best interests of their clients, and making technical changes to improve the fairness of how fund managers profit from investors buying and selling their funds. All of which might get an airing again this week, as the sector will be in the news, with the likes of Jupiter Fund Management and Ashmore scheduled to announce some numbers. After a decent year in 2017, Jupiter said last month that it had been hit by customers pulling money out of its funds and by underperformance in the first quarter of 2018. Shares in the company \u2013 which has long been associated with the UK\u2019s retail investors \u2013 are down around 25% this year, while around \u00a31bn has been pulled from two of its flagship funds by clients. There is always some excuse for poor performance (Jupiter\u2019s was that other funds had taken more risk) but the truth is that, with a few notable exceptions, fund managers are better at charging fees than picking shares. As another E*Trade ad from the last century pointed out, if your fund manager really was so talented at investing, he or she would probably not still be at work. However, there are some who still covet the likes of Jupiter. Last week the FCA issued a warning that \u201cfraudsters are using the details of [fund management] firms we authorise to try to convince people that they work for a genuine, authorised firm\u201d and identified scammers using a \u201cclone\u201d firm called Jupiter Fund Management. Apart from the oddness of pretending to be a firm in the middle of a bad trot, the notice also provokes another thought among City wags: unless Jupiter fund managers up their game, punters might just be tempted to give the scammers a try.",
