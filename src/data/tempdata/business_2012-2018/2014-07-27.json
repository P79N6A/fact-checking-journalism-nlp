      "bodyText": "Matalan is the only major British retailer not to have donated money to the UN-backed fund to compensation the victims of the Rana Plaza factory collapse. The budget high street retailer has made no contribution to Rana Plaza trust fund ahead of the official fundraising deadline on Thursday, according to the campaign group 38 Degrees. Other British retailers linked to the factory, including Primark, Asda, Debenhams and N Brown, have paid money into the fund to support the families of the 1,129 people who died and the 2,515 who were injured in the 2013 disaster. Matalan was asked to donate \u00a33m to the fund, which is backed by the International Labour Organisation (ILO), a UN agency. The company, which is run by Jason Hargreaves, the son of the chain's billionaire founder John, said it was \"fully committed to its role as a responsible lender\" and had chosen to fund a different scheme. It declined to say how much it had donated to the Rana Plaza Survivors Rehabilitation Scheme, which is managed by Bangladeshi development organisation BRAC. \"We believe that if every one of the retailers that had garments produced in Rana Plaza gave just a small proportion of the money that they made as a result to helping the survivors and their families, then well over $40m could be raised,\" a spokesman said. Matalan said it had committed to giving 100% of the money it made from its clothes made in Rana Plaza to the BRAC fund, but given that it received only an \"initial pilot shipment\" of clothes from the factory, it was unlikely to have made very much money from garments produced there. \"We have visited the area several times to see the work that BRAC is doing on the ground in Bangladesh, including providing essential medical care and helping people build a self-sufficient future, providing counselling where it is needed, enhancing basic life skills and supporting those who do not wish to return to work in the factories by helping them find new jobs.\" BRAC's schemes are not seen, however, to provide full compensation for loss of earnings by injured workers and the families of those who died. Matalan said it was also supporting the Bangladesh fire and building safety accord, the body set up in the wake of the disaster to ensure higher factory standards through a legally binding agreement, but it did not say how much money it had provided. The organisation said last week that retailers needed to stump up another \u00a34m.

      "bodyText": "The boss of Ovo Energy, one of Britain's fastest-growing new power suppliers, has taken \u00a32m out of the business for his own use at a time when the startup is struggling to break even. Stephen Fitzpatrick cashed out through a share transaction despite the business running up less than \u00a3300,000 annual profits and having net liabilities of more than \u00a39m for the last calendar year. The move could anger energy campaigners who have repeatedly criticised Sam Laidlaw, the chief executive of British Gas parent group Centrica, for earning \u00a32.2m last year for running a much larger business. An Ovo spokeswoman justified the \u00a32m share transaction by saying the money was needed to buy a family house for Fitzpatrick, a former City trader who now earns a basic salary of \u00a3120,000 a year. \"As a young entrepreneur, Stephen took a big risk when he founded the business, and it has been very exciting watching the company grow to a value many times that of the initial sum invested,\" she said. \"After five years of living and breathing the company, Stephen decided to invest in a new family home \u2026 The couple started Ovo with an initial \u00a3350,000 of their own money, raised in part from the sale of their previous home.

Documents at Companies House show that Fitzpatrick was paid \u00a32m for 564 shares in Ovo Energy Ltd, where he is the sole director, on 17 July 2013. That stake is believed to represent 4.5% of Ovo Energy, leaving him with 15.5% of the shares. The shares were bought by the holding group Ovo Group, which also appears to be 100% owned by Fitzpatrick and his family. Disclosure of the move comes at a difficult time for the business. It has been benefiting from widespread disillusionment with the big six, but has also come under fire from competitors. Its main rival, Ecotricity, in particular, has recently written to the energy regulator, Ofgem, alleging that Ovo is putting customers' money at risk by making some of them pay up front rather than after power is provided as most other energy supply companies do. Ecotricity, another supplier that is trying to challenge the domination of the big six power providers such as British Gas and SSE, has called on the energy regulator, Ofgem, to investigate what it claims are a number of breaches of licence by Ovo. Ovo, which only started trading in 2009, denies all the claims against it, saying that the mud-slinging is driven by professional rivalry and is a result of the Bristol-based business trying to come up with ever new ways of doing business and cutting costs for customers. Ovo says asking for money up front is the best way of funding the business and finding the best wholesale power deals for its customers. \"Taking payment in advance is actually permitted by the Ofgem regulations and we believe it's in our customers' best interests as it helps us keep our costs down, which means lower bills,\" it says. Ovo points out that Ofgem has worked hard to ensure that Ovo is allowed to keep an offer of giving 3% interest on cash balances it holds from customers, despite criticism from Ecotricity and others. Doing the sums \u00a3300,000 Annual profits reported by Ovo Energy are just under this sum, with net liabilities of \u00a39m in the last calendar year 400,000 Number of Ovo's customers, built up over five years of rapid growth 4.5% Proportion of business that stake sold by Fitzpatrick is believed to represent",

      "bodyText": "Investors in the former Russian oil company Yukos are confident they will receive a multi-billion pound financial settlement on Monday in a landmark case that threatens maximum embarrassment for BP and the Kremlin at a sensitive time. Europe's top arbitration court in The Hague has been hearing a case about the illegal expropriation of assets brought by five investors including the former Yukos chief executive, Platon Lebedev. A ruling in favour of GML, the majority shareholders in Yukos, would be damaging to BP because the disputed Yukos assets ended up in the hands of another major oil company, Rosneft, in which it owns a 20% stake. It would also be a setback for the Kremlin at a time when it is under pressure from the west over its role in eastern Ukraine. The claim, under the energy charter treaty, amounts to $103.5bn (\u00a361bn), but the court will decide how much compensation GML should receive if the ruling goes in its favour. In the event of GML succeeding, Russia's response will be widely watched. Yukos was originally set up by Mikhail Khodorkovsky with Lebedev's help, but the company crumbled in 2004 when the Russian government demanded it paid $27bn in taxes. Both Khodorkovsky and Lebedev were jailed. They have recently been released, but Yukos's oil fields and other assets were auctioned off and eventually bought by Rosneft. Yukos, once Russia's biggest company, and many western supporters maintained that the tax bill and jailings were a result of Vladimir Putin wanting to rid himself of oligarchs who were using their corporate power base to meddle in politics. But the Kremlin has always argued that all the actions taken against Yukos and its executives were entirely justified under Russian law. Khodorkovsky sold off his interest in Yukos to pay his legal expenses, but Lebedev and GML have brought what is believed to be the largest ever arbitration case in history. The litigation was first filed in February 2005 but it took until 2009 before a ruling about the jurisdiction and admissibility of the claim was made in GML's favour. Tim Osborne, a British lawyer and director of GML, is planning to make a statement about the arbitration findings when the court in The Hague makes its final ruling at 9am London time. The result is not yet known, but industry sources said: \"They are organising a big press conference. They would not be doing this unless they expected to win.\"",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "British taxpayers underwrote more than \u00a3100m worth of exports to Russia last year, including the sale of Airbus aircraft to an airline leasing firm linked to the state arms company Rosboronexport and owned by a Russian bank subjected to US sanctions. The revelation that British government financial support is being extended to Russian deals is likely to embarrass David Cameron, who last week called for hard-hitting sanctions against the country's president, Vladimir Putin, and his government. The credit insurance funding was provided UK Export Finance (UKEF), part of the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills, in the year to April 2014 and is shown in its latest annual report. It includes underwriting a \u00a330m deal to help Airbus sell its planes to the Russian state-owned VEB Leasing. On its website, the company says it was \"established at the initiative and with the participation of Rosoboronexport with the objective of raising product competitiveness of defence industry and civil engineering enterprises and facilitating their modernisation\". VEB Leasing's main shareholder is the Russian state development bank Vnesheconombank (VEB), which was subjected to US sanctions earlier this month. Another \u00a338m of government funding guarantee was extended to help EADS Astrium sell high-powered communication satellites to Russia Space Communication, which is part of the Russian communications ministry. The Russian government said the satellite technology was intended to provide TV and broadband to remote regions. UKEF funding support is designed to help British companies obtain insurance and credit to help them export goods when traditional lenders may be afraid to provide financing. If the buyer goes bust or refuses to pay, the British taxpayer could be liable for the full value of the deal. The revelation of UK taxpayer support for exports to Russia comes as the prime minister has called on Europe to impose sanctions on Russia after the downing of Malaysia Airlines flight MH17. Cameron called for action against Russian banks and airlines and for Putin's \"cronies and oligarchs\" to be blocked from accessing capital. He has also expressed frustration that other EU countries, including France and Germany, had failed to back his calls for the toughest possible sanctions against Moscow. \"Those of us in Europe should not need to be reminded of the consequences of turning a blind eye when big countries bully smaller countries,\" he said last week. George Osborne, the chancellor, has also called for tougher sanctions against Moscow. \"Think of the economic hit of allowing international borders to be ignored, or allowing airliners to be shot down,\" he said. \"That's a much greater hit for Britain and we're not prepared to allow that to happen.\" John Mann, a Labour member of the Commons Treasury committee, said the revelations that UK taxpayer funds were used to support Russian deals was highly embarrassing for Cameron. \"It is totally hypocritical to be subsidising Russia while calling on Europe to introduce hard-hitting sanctions,\" he told the Guardian. \"Cameron has the power to act on this, but he hasn't. It is tough talk but no action, and it is damaging the reputation of our country.\" A government spokeswoman said: \"The role of UKEF is to support UK exporters. Historically, some of those exporters have traded in Russia and our annual report for 2013/14 sets out the support we gave for UK exporters selling to Russia. This pre-dated the Ukraine crisis.\" She declined to comment on whether UKEF had stopped supporting Russian exports in the wake of the crisis. The UKEF has long supported British exports to Russia, with \u00a3215m of loan guarantees extended in the 2012-13 financial year. That included \u00a353m to support the export of mining equipment to Siberian Coal Energy, Russia's largest coal company owned by the billionaire Andrey Melnichenko.",

      "bodyText": "Profit warnings from UK companies have hit a three-year high despite the improving economy, with the strong pound a growing problem for businesses with overseas operations. As a number of major companies, including Rolls-Royce, BAE Systems, GKN and Diageo, prepare to reveal the impact of sterling's recent rise on their profits, a report released on Sunday shows adverse currency movements triggered more than a fifth of profit warnings in the first half of 2014, compared with just 3% last year. The pound has appreciated by about 12% against a basket of currencies since the start of the year, lifted by the prospect of the Bank of England becoming the first major central bank to raise interest rates after a sustained period of cheap borrowing. In May, Rolls, which reports first-half profits on Thursday, said adverse foreign exchange effects could knock \u00a340m off full-year profits and \u00a3300m off revenues. With intense competition and pricing pressures adding to the currency woes, UK-quoted companies issued 137 profit warnings in the first six months of the year, up 9% on the same period in 2013 and the highest first-half total since 2011, according to consultancy group EY. Manufacturing was one sector hit hard by the rise in sterling, but support services was the sector with the highest number of currency-related warnings, with one-third relating to exchange rates. Keith McGregor at EY said: \"The pound's rapid rise is one of the biggest pressures on earnings, although the problem highlighted in profit warnings isn't one of sales but of currency translation. Recent history shows that UK exports are relatively insensitive to currency effects. However, the pound's leap to multi-year highs has caught out a number of companies who translate foreign earnings back into pounds.\" He said the second half was likely to pose more challenges than the first. \"Central bank actions have helped to quash volatility, pushing asset prices to pre-crisis highs. However, the countdown to a new monetary era will bring new tests and greater volatility as markets begin to reprice risk.\" Despite the well-rehearsed problems on the high street, quoted UK retailers issued an unusually low level of profit warnings in the first six months of 2014, just six compared with nine in the first half of 2013. Alan Hudson, EY's head of restructuring for the UK and Ireland, said: \"The FTSE general retailers sector has already undergone a deep level of restructuring in response to relentless competition and structural change. This pace isn't letting up and the grocery sector looks set to face the next round.

      "bodyText": "There was a time when the closest Christofer Toumazou thought he would get to the hallowed halls of Imperial College in London was when he was walking down Exhibition road on the way to the science museum, with the workshops of the esteemed institution visible on his right. But at age 23, and without an O level or A level \u2013 let alone an Oxbridge degree \u2013 on his CV, the young engineer was accepted for a postdoctoral position in the university, beginning a career from there which would see him create a combined digital and analogue mobile phone, an artificial pancreas for type one diabetics and a wireless heart monitor, among other inventions. It is his latest creation, however, which has sparked the most interest and last month earned him a European inventor award. Using a small silicon microchip in a USB, a 'lab on a chip' as it has been coined, DNA data can be analysed within minutes and outside a laboratory. The new technology is aimed at identifying predispositions for hereditary diseases like diabetes and prescribing the exact right dosage for medications, cutting down on the cost of current DNA testing machines. \"My dream was to have a handheld consumer device with \u2026 a little USB stick that could look at rapidly screening for genetic mutations of particular diseases, whether it is a predisposition to type two diabetes [or] whether to a type of breast cancer,\" said Toumazou in his office in the Institute of Biomedical Engineering. The new DNA analysis method is the latest instalment in a far from traditional career path for the Greek-Cypriot. Having left school in Cheltenham at 16 with a \"few CSEs\", the most typical route for him to follow would have been in the family catering business until he became inspired by an aunt's husband who was an engineer and from there developed an interest in electrical engineering. Encouraged to do a one year radio and electronics certificate \u2013 when the \"whole Greek Cypriot contingent of Cheltenham turned up\" on his first day \u2013 he says he found the environment in which he wanted to thrive and went on to a two year general engineering course, a degree at the then Oxford polytechnic and later a PhD. By 23, he had applied for a postdoctoral position at Imperial College and was offered it the same day. The position involved working with industry to reduce the size of a satellite phone at a time when his interest was in analogue \u2013 speech, sound and vision \u2013 electronics. Thaksin Shinawatra, the former Thai prime minister who then ran a mobile phone operator, asked him to make a combined digital and analogue mobile phone in the 90s, which led to the establishment of Toumaz Technology, a commercial spin-off. His next inspiration came in combining the biological and electronic, working on cochlear implants and directing Toumazou towards healthcare. \"I was very keen on bringing medical grade technology to the consumer,\" he said. Later came the Sensium, a processor termed a \"digital plaster\" which could monitor vital health signs \u2013 heart rate, respiration and temperature among others \u2013 of patients and then send them to a nurses' station, cutting down on the gaps between observations and leading to prioritisation of patients in accident and emergency departments. At around the same time, his son Marcus \u2013 now in his early 20s \u2013 got renal failure when he was nine years old. \"For the first time I was on the receiving side of what medical technology was like rather than being in a plush environment trying to develop all these super duper widgets and gadgets and it really, really frightened me,\" he said. This personal development led him to focus on technology which could detect hereditary diseases like his son had which, while it would not have prevented it, would have been able to help manage his condition better. Describing his DNA analysis system as his \"simplest invention but most significant\", Toumazou focuses on the fact that humans differ by 0.1%. That difference, he says, shows whether people can metabolise drugs properly and whether there are different genetic conditions present. His invention uses small silicon microchips which can identify genetic differences which dictate a person's inclination to hereditary diseases like diabetes or how they will react to a drug like warfarin, which is used to treat blood clots. To use the 'lab on a chip' system, a sample of saliva or a swab from inside the mouth is taken and put inside a container with the chip inside. The chip is then put inside a USB stick and plugged into a computer after which results are returned within about 30 minutes. One of the key benefits is the speed of the return of information, said Toumazou. In a situation where a drug is needed to counter a hospital-based infection, the new technology could help determine what drug is needed in a short space of time instead of waiting and risking fatality. Cost savings on conventional DNA-sequencing machines opens the possibility for use in areas like sub-Saharan Africa where clinics can be poorly equipped. DNA Electronics, the company set up by Toumazou around the technology, licences out its patents to companies including Roche, Life Technologies and the National Institute for Health Research of the NHS. The technology has also been licensed out to Geneu, a cosmetics company based on New Bond Street where bespoke anti-ageing products are created based on DNA testing. Toumazou says \"real science\" will get recognised in the industry where there is so much \"placebo science\" and will help in wider acceptance of his invention. \"If it gets recognised, then it will help with my big picture of getting consumer acceptance. It takes the stigma away from it being a medial device and then I can go back to the big picture and it is all about lifestyle,\" he said. How it Works The DNA testing takes place on the \"lab on a chip\" where organic semiconductors and sensors which use tiny amounts of chemicals do tests on the spot. The chip can recognise a genetic mutation in a sample which is placed on it and return the results in minutes. This allows the identification of certain hereditary diseases like diabetes. It is through this technology that Toumazou claims doctors will soon be looking at a patient's future medical records instead of their past.",

      "bodyText": "It's the late 1480s. An Italian navigator and explorer by the name of Christopher Columbus has the idea that by sailing westwards he could reach the East Indies. He needs to fit out ships for his voyage and goes looking for venture capital to back his scheme. So who gives Columbus the money for the Ni\u00f1a, the Pinta and the Santa Maria? Not the bankers of his native Genoa but Queen Isabella and King Ferdinand of Spain. This story of how it was the state rather than the private sector that backed the voyage Columbus made across the Atlantic in 1492 was told by a participant at a three-day conference in London last week. There are more recent examples. The commitment by John F Kennedy in the early 1960s to put a man on the moon by the end of the decade led to spin-offs including memory foam for beds, improved radial tyres, freeze-dried food and cochlear implants. Speaking at last week's event, Andy Haldane, the Bank of England's chief economist, said today's investment is tomorrow's growth, but added that investment requires the patience to forgo instant gratification. People started to become more patient 50,000 years ago with the development of the prefrontal cortex, even though for tens of thousands of years, growth rates remained extremely low. Haldane noted that in recent years, there had been a tendency for societies to become less patient, perhaps caused by a surfeit of information leading to a deficit of attention. Financial markets were an example of this, Haldane said. There was too much information, excessive liquidity and too much short-termism. Adair Turner, the former chairman of the Financial Services Authority, built on this theme. He noted that not only had finance's share of GDP increased fourfold to around 8% since the 1950s, but that the idea that banks took in deposits from savers and recycled them as loans to budding entrepreneurs was now a thing of the past. Instead, two developments explained the increased size of the financial sector: the tendency of banks to trade with each other, and the focus on lending to the property market, seen as safer than lending to business. Between them, Haldane and Turner provided a pretty good explanation of the way in which the economy has behaved over the past 40 years. Finance has got bigger and less patient. It has become less willing to lend for new business ventures and more willing to lend for speculative activities in the financial and property markets. Cheap money does not prompt an increase in funding for entrepreneurs \u2013 it simply provides a bigger stack of casino chips. In the circumstances, it is hardly surprising that fundamental economic change remains elusive, not just in Britain but in Europe and the US as well. If there is a lack of investment today, there will be no growth tomorrow. The story of the past 250 years of capitalist development has been of waves of creative destruction: a new wave of products replacing an exhausted technological paradigm. There is a new wave waiting out there, but its emergence is being hindered by a lack of finance. How can this problem be addressed? Firms could bypass the banks and seek alternative sources of finance. The rise of peer-to-peer lending suggests that this is happening, although still on a relatively small scale. Attempts could be made to force banks to change their ways, either by governments nationalising them or by increasing the capital requirements on mortgage lending to make it more expensive. Don't hold your breath. Finally, the state could take a more active role. This was the business secretary Vince Cable's theme at the conference, where he listed ways in which the government was using public money to encourage innovation. \"If we consistently invest less in our science and innovation capabilities than our competitors, we cannot expect to sustain the UK as a world leader in knowledge-based activity,\" was his blunt assessment. Cable noted that the share of GDP spent on research and development in the UK stood at 1.7%, well below the 2.8% in the US and 4% in South Korea. Germany and France spend more than 2% of GDP on R&amp;D, with the aspiration of reaching 3%. There is a similar deficit in support for innovation, which is 10 times higher as a share of the economy in Finland than in Britain. The current government, to its credit, has set up seven \"catapult\" centres \u2013 places where scientists, engineers and businesses can work to turn ideas into new products and services \u2013 based on the German Fraunhofer institutes. The seven sectors identified are advanced manufacturing, cell therapy, offshore energy, satellite applications, the digital economy, future cities and transport, but as Cable readily admits, the UK is a long way behind. There are more Fraunhofers outside Germany than the UK has catapult centres. Innovation support has a big payback. Technology Strategy Board investment to support business-led innovation has generated a return to the economy of \u00a33-9 of additional value for each \u00a31 of public money invested. These are not easy times for Whitehall ministers to be asking for cash from the Treasury, but Cable insisted \"a doubling of innovation spend is what a serious commitment to innovation means\". Actually, it means more than that. The loosening of Treasury purse strings to expand the work of the Technology Strategy Board would be welcome but a fundamental recasting of the economy will only happen if and when the state accepts that it can shape and create markets. The clue was in the title of last week's conference: mission-oriented finance for innovation. Once governments have decided what the mission is, the private sector will respond to the opportunities provided. In the past, missions have involved discovering the new world, defeating fascism, winning the cold war and putting men in space. In a paper written for the conference, Mariana Mazzucato and Carlota Perez said that today's mission was a \"policy direction that is smart, inclusive and takes advantage of 'green' as the next big technological and market opportunity\". By greening the economy, Mazzucato and Perez are talking about more than just low-carbon and renewable energies. They are talking about \"conservation; pollution control; reduction of material content per product; replacing products, possession and waste with services, rental and maintenance and recycling, respectively; promoting the flourishing of the creative economy; making cities more liveable and less polluting; revamping transport systems and the built economy; promoting collaborative and sharing economies; focusing on health (including preventive and personalised medicine); and promoting all forms of education, in and out of school\". Let's be clear. Change on this ambitious scale has happened before and could happen again. But only if the state has a mission, loses its hang-ups about picking winners and understands there is more to good government than bean counting.",

These are not easy times for Whitehall ministers to be asking for cash from the Treasury, but Cable insisted \"a doubling of innovation spend is what a serious commitment to innovation means\".</p> <p>Actually, it means more than that. The loosening of Treasury purse strings to expand the work of the Technology Strategy Board would be welcome but a fundamental recasting of the economy will only happen if and when the state accepts that it can shape and create markets. The clue was in the title of last week's conference: mission-oriented finance for innovation. Once governments have decided what the mission is, the private sector will respond to the opportunities provided.</p> <p>In the past, missions have involved discovering the new world, defeating fascism, winning the cold war and putting men in space. In a paper written for the conference, Mariana Mazzucato and Carlota Perez said that today's mission was a \"policy direction that is smart, inclusive and takes advantage of 'green' as the next big technological and market opportunity\".</p> <p>By greening the economy, Mazzucato and Perez are talking about more than just low-carbon and renewable energies. They are talking about \"conservation; pollution control; reduction of material content per product; replacing products, possession and waste with services, rental and maintenance and recycling, respectively; promoting the flourishing of the creative economy; making cities more liveable and less polluting; revamping transport systems and the built economy; promoting collaborative and sharing economies; focusing on health (including preventive and personalised medicine); and promoting all forms of education, in and out of school\".</p> <p>Let's be clear. Change on this ambitious scale has happened before and could happen again. But only if the state has a mission, loses its hang-ups about picking winners and understands there is more to good government than bean counting.</p>",
