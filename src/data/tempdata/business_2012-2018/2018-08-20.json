      "bodyText": "Nike has come under fire for selling a balaclava that critics say plays on stereotypes of black youths involved in gang violence. The Nike x MMW balaclava, which appeared to have been removed from sale on the company\u2019s website on Monday, is a full face covering that extends down the neck and across the upper chest of wearers. It is intended to keep wearers warm in cold weather conditions. But critics say that its marketing, including pictures of it worn by a young black model in a T-shirt and another garment similar to military special forces webbing, appears aimed at youngsters aiming for a gang-inspired look, of the kind popularised by drill music videos. In one widely viewed video on Facebook, Paul McKenzie, a commentator who regularly tackles issues of crime affecting London\u2019s black community, said: \u201cYou know these young people on the street adore these manufacturers, they buy everything that they sell. \u201cWe look at images of young people on the street and they look menacing already, and so Nike decides to bring out a balaclava range which looks absolutely menacing. Maybe I\u2019m getting old, maybe I\u2019m a dinosaur, but this balaclava range looks quite inciteful [sic].\u201d In another video posted on Twitter the comedian White Yardie also condemned Nike. \u201cTell me this a joke, because right now it looks like you are targeting the young people who are involved in gang crime, and with all these recent stabbings that we have been seeing right now in London, this is definitely something we don\u2019t want to see,\u201d he said. The NikeLab NRG Beryllium Balaclava x MMW was launched on 12 July, priced at \u00a369, as part of a range of collaborations with Williams, a designer whose clothes have been worn by Kanye West, Travis Scott and Tom Sachs, among others. Most of the range has sold out, yet the balaclava appears to be the only product completely withdrawn from sale. Its webpage on the Nike website was replaced on Monday with a message stating: \u201cThe product you are looking for is no longer available.\u201d Also included in the range is a \u00a3385 jacket with a hood that includes a built in face mask. A Nike spokesperson said: \u201cThese products were part of a wider Nike Training collection, styled on different models and available in multiple markets around the world. We are in no way condoning or encouraging the serious issue of criminal and gang culture.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The labour force figures out last week showed that the strong employment growth of 2017 is well behind us, but the interest now is on how long will the slide occur and whether by the time of the next election the employment picture will be buoyant or continuing to slide. The latest figures were decidedly in the \u201cgood, not great\u201d category. Yes, the unemployment rate fell in seasonally adjusted terms from 5.4% to 5.3% \u2013 although that was mostly due to a fall in the participation rate. But that aside, the general trend of the unemployment rate has been falling lower now for nearly 18 months: But that rather good news was balanced by the overall slowing of employment growth. It was always unlikely that the jobs market would stay as buoyant as it was last year. The reality is, even when the economy is going well, the growth of employment peaks and troughs. Generally it takes about 12 months to go from a peak to a trough \u2013 a bit longer if the economy is performing poorly as occurred during the global financial crisis: The interesting thing is that the past two years have been pretty much a case of 12 months of decline followed by 12 months of improving growth. In December 2015, after a long period of improving employment growth, it peaked at 2.7%. Twelve months later, in December 2016, the trough of 0.9% was reached and then another 12 months later, the next peak of 3.3% was achieved: We saw this also reflected in the growth of full-time employment for both men and women. Since December last year, the annual growth of full-time employment has been trending down (although for men the peak occurred in October): A similar situation occurs even when we break down the employment growth by age. Youth workers generally see bigger swings of job growth (or falls) but for those between the ages of 15 and 24 since the end of last year, growth has generally flattened, while for prime age workers of 25-64 years, the tide has definitely been going out: This of course is nothing unusual \u2013 the labour market, much like businesses, goes in cycles, and growth cannot always keep improving. The difficulty is knowing just when the corner has been turned. But with now more than six months of slowing growth, the picture is clear that we are on a downward path. The question is for how long. The seasonally adjusted figures can be rather erratic but they can be a pointer to where things are headed: One way to do it is to look at the average of the past three months compared to the annual growth. Generally when the annualised three month growth is stronger than the actual annual growth things are improving, and when the opposite occurs, growth is generally going to fall: Right now we see that the annualised growth of the past three months is pretty much equal with the annual growth figures, which suggests that the end of the slowing is near \u2013 or at least things are unlikely to get much worse. This of course is good news especially given the hope is that stronger employment growth will lead to stronger wage growth. While the link between the two is pretty weak \u2013 generally the link with wages is more about unemployment and underemployment than actual employment growth \u2013 there are certainly no prospects of wages improving if employment growth continues to slow. And as ever the impact of the economy has major ramifications for politics. Should the recent cycle continue, it would suggest that employment growth will pick up again next year \u2013 possibly around the time of the next election. The single biggest boast the Liberal party has been able to cling to has been strong employment growth. This year the talk has mostly been about the record growth of 2017, and such a line would get a tad tired by the time 2019 comes around. But should things pick up in the same time frame that they have in the past three years, then by May next year the government will be talking about an improving situation. That will still see them having to worry about the issue of wages growth and household incomes. But in an economic sense \u2013 and thus leaving aside the leadership shenanigans and a complete lack of a policy on climate change \u2013 the election may very well hang on whether the government can convince voters their policies have made getting a job easier, and that better wages and income will follow. Because while employment growth might improve by next year, its current slowdown hints that time could be running out for wages growth to significantly start improving by the next election. \u2022 Greg Jericho is a Guardian Australia columnist \u2022 This story was amended on 21 August 2018 to correct the figures for the seasonally adjusted unemployment rate.",

      "bodyText": "Salesforce, the Silicon Valley cloud computing giant, is being targeted by activists hoping to force the company to end its contract with US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) amid accusations that the agency is violating human rights. Organisations including Greenpeace, Demand Progress, New York State Nurses Association and Fight for the Future, an advocacy group which is coordinating the campaign, are threatening to boycott the company if they do not end their contract. The activists are also calling for a boycott of Salesforce\u2019s flagship Dreamforce conference, to be held in San Francisco in September, and targeting speakers at the conference including former vice-president Al Gore, musician will.i.am, Unilever chief investment officer Jane Moran and Entourage actor Adrian Grenier, asking them to drop out. CBP is using Salesforce products to manage border activities. The company\u2019s involvement with CBP comes as the Trump administration continues to struggle to clear up the mess left by its policy of separating undocumented migrant children from their families once they have been intercepted. \u201cSalesforce prides itself on being a socially aware and responsible company, but they are showing otherwise by refusing to drop their contract with a government agency that has and is clearly violating human rights,\u201d said Jelani Drew, a campaigner for Fight for the Future. \u201cIn history, tech has been used to drive the human suffering, oppression and tragedy. It\u2019s time for Salesforce executives to pick which side of history to be on and what they want their legacy to be.\u201d The move comes after more than 650 Salesforce employees signed a petition calling on chief executive officer Marc Benioff to end the contract. \u201cGiven the inhuman separation from their parents currently taking place at the border, we believe that our core value of Equality is at stake and that Salesforce should re-examine our contractual relationship with CBP and speak out against its practices,\u201d the letter read, according to a copy viewed by Bloomberg News. Benioff \u2013 who backed Hillary Clinton in the 2016 election and has been highly critical of Trump \u2013 has told staff he shares their concerns. \u201cI\u2019m opposed to separating children from their families at the border. It is immoral,\u201d Benioff wrote in a memo to Salesforce employees obtained by Bloomberg News. \u201cI have personally financially supported legal groups helping families at the border. I also wrote to the White House to encourage them to end this horrible situation.\u201d But so far the company has made no moves to end the contract.",

      "bodyText": "Greece has turned the page to become \u201ca normal\u201d member of the single currency, European Union authorities in Brussels declared as the country finally exited its eight-year bailout programm, writes Jennifer Rankin. Its three bailouts during the eurozone crisis totalled \u20ac288.7bn (\u00a3258bn) \u2013 the world\u2019s biggest-ever financial rescue. During that time, as the crisis that threatened to lead to the nation\u2019s ejection from the single currency \u2013 \u201cGrexit\u201d \u2013 Greece has had four governments and endured one of the worst recessions in economic history. Marking the official end of the third bailout programme on Monday, Pierre Moscovici, the European commissioner for economic and financial affairs, said Greece was beginning a new chapter after eight \u201cvery difficult\u201d years. \u201cWe have had eight very difficult years, often very painful years, where we have had three successive programmes. But now Greece can finally turn the page in a crisis that has lasted too long,\u201d he told journalists. \u201cThe worst is over.\u201d Our full report is here: On that note, it\u2019s time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. The Turkish lira continues to come under pressure, now down 1.66%. Kathleen Brooks, research director at Capital Index, says: Germany may say no now, but it is becoming increasingly likely that Turkey will need significant amounts of financial aid in the months to come. Qatar has come in with a credit line to backstop the economy, and has promised $15bn of investment in Turkey. However, this has not been able to stabilise the lira at the start of the week, which has suffered another rout today. The problem for investors is two-fold: firstly, Moody\u2019s and S&amp;P, the credit rating agencies, cut Turkey\u2019s debt to junk status at the end of last week, which limits the amount of sovereign debt larger investors like pension funds can purchase, it could also make a bailout by the likes of Germany less likely. Secondly, the spat between the US and Turkey continues to gain pace. As the US threatens more tariffs, shots were fired this morning at the US embassy in Ankora. Until Erdogan\u2019s government frees pastor Andrew Bunson, it is hard to see the Trump administration cutting Turkey some slack. Regardless of your view on the rights or wrongs of what the US is doing to Turkey financially, with Trump as President, it certainly doesn\u2019t pay to mess with the US, especially when you upset the evangelical wing of the US this close to the mid-terms. Meanwhile in Athens it has not gone unnoticed that Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras has chosen to remain silent about Greece\u2019s much-awaited bailout exit, writes Helena Smith from Athens. His only public utterance today has been to tweet his congratulations to the county\u2019s youth water polo team on its world championship victory. Has this got something to do, perhaps, with the fact that his leftist-led government has signed up to a staggering array of ambitious targets? Post\u2013bailout Greece has committed to produce primary surpluses of 3.5 % of GDP until 2022 \u2013 a feat achieved by only a handful of countries since the seventies - and 2.2 % until 2060. For professor Kevin Featherstone who has followed the twists and turns of the crisis as head of the Hellenic Observatory at the London School of Economics, such obligations amount to perpetual purgatory. \u201cNo other government in Europe would choose to follow this path. It is Ordoliberalism gone wild,\u201d he told the Guardian. With the fiscal straightjacket remaining so tight, there will be little scope for future administrations to improve economic competitiveness through investment, or accelerate social support for those pauperised by austerity. \u201cRehabilitation falls well short,\u201d Professor Featherstone said. \u201cThe prospect of a recurrence of the debt crisis has been eliminated but nothing has been done to help Greek society overcome the trauma of excessively high unemployment and bankruptcies.\u201d Tsipras had hoped to mark the exit with a visit to Kastelorizo, the remote Aegean isle where the drama began. Celebrating Greece\u2019s \u2018liberation\u2019 in the place where former Prime Minister George Papandreou had in April 2010 first announced that Athens would seek help from the EU and IMF \u2013 after surging Greek bond yields made borrowing on capital markets prohibitive - seemed appropriate to coming full-circle. But the outcry over his government\u2019s handling of last month\u2019s wildfires \u2013 a calamity that has left 94 dead and brought devastation and ruination to hundreds more \u2013 put paid to the idea. Fanfare, aides say, will be kept to a minimum. The chief economist of the ESM rescue fund has admitted there were mistakes made with Greece. In an interview with CNBC Rolf Strauch said: This was a severe crisis situation and obviously it\u2019s difficult to claim that everything went well in the sense that everything was completely right at the time. I think the overall direction of the programme was right and what we\u2019re seeing now, are particularly the consequences of those many reforms that were taken, and it\u2019s true that also the Greek people deserve a lot of respect for what they did over the years. Reforms have the feature that it takes a bit until you see the impact and so the benefits of the reforms weren\u2019t occurring right at the start or right from the moment when they were taken, but they are coming in now and I think this process will continue. You should see the projected growth rates, they are about 2%. This is good news, the task is now to stay on course and reap the benefits of what was done in the past. He also says that the efforts Greece has to make are not yet over: Obviously, it takes a lot to restructure an economy, and therefore [Greece has agreed] the steps to be taken by the Greek authorities in the coming years and they have made some commitments on that. The head of the European Stability Mechanism, the euro zone\u2019s bailout fund, has wasted no time stressing the point that the debt-Stricken country will be subject to a strict regime of enhanced surveillance post-bailout, reports Helena Smith from Athens: Speaking to the Greek daily Ethnos this morning Klaus Regling, the rescue fund chief, emphasized that Athens will be strictly monitored in the coming years so there is no let up in reform implementation. \u201cGreece is exceptional. It has received much more loans from us than any other country,\u201d he told the paper, saying that Athens unlike any other member state had also benefited from \u201c huge amounts of debt relief.\u201d \u201cNo other programme country has received anything comparable. Therefore, the monitoring will be tighter than in the other cases and this will take the form of the so-called enhanced surveillance.\u201d Meanwhile the Greek government spokesman was hailing the \u201cnew phase\u201d the country was about to enter. \u201cCitizens will soon feel the difference,\u201d Dimitris TzAnnakopoulos told a radio station earlier today. He said prime minister Alexis Tsipras would soon be announcing handouts when he gave his annual economic address at the Thessaloniki trade fair next month and elaborated how the budget surplus would be handled. Here\u2019s an earlier piece looking at the country\u2019s future following the bailout exit: And Greece will also continue to be monitored: On the other hand, Greece still faces serious challenges, according to Joan Hoey, director for Europe at The Economist Intelligence Unit: There has been lots of pain, but to what gain, and to what purpose has the Greek government signed up to multi-decade, large primary budget surplus targets which are likely to hobble growth? The economy has been in almost permanent recession since 2010, and real GDP has shrunk by more than a quarter from its pre-crisis peak in 2007-08. Unemployment is still about 20%, and youth unemployment is more than double that. Despite undertaking the biggest post-crisis fiscal adjustment of any euro zone country, Greece\u2019s public debt is equal to about 180% of GDP. ESM fiscal and structural reform policies, to which Greece will remain subject after the third economic adjustment programme expires, are unlikely to generate sufficient economic growth to mitigate the country\u2019s debt burden or reduce popular disaffection. Grexit is not a short-term risk, but Greece will struggle to improve competitiveness inside the euro area or grow its way out of its huge debt burden (179.1% of GDP in 2017), so it will remain a significant risk over the medium and long term. The past eight years of bailouts have exacted a high cost in per capita GDP, employment, wages, pensions, living standards, life satisfaction and social and political cohesion. Greece has lowest life satisfaction rating of any OECD country. Divisions of income, equality, class and politics have sharpened. Greek sovereignty and democracy undermined as the country became subject to external tutelage. There is no popular enthusiasm for any party: popular cynicism and disaffection reign. Greece has been benefiting from cyclical upswing in the euro zone in 2017-18; and tourism and merchandise exports have also performing well. These factors will remain important, and point to stronger real GDP growth of around 2% this year, after 1.3% growth in 2017. However, Greece faces formidable medium- and long-term challenges, including a very poor demographic outlook; a dysfunctional labour market and a huge emigration of Greeks during the past decade; still weak public finances; poor banking asset quality; closed professions; bad regulation; and an unsustainable public debt load. These structural weakness, together with a commitment to deliver annual primary budget surplus targets of 3.5% of GDP in 2018-22 and of 2% of GDP in 2023- 2060 will shackle growth. The austerity measures undertaken by Greece will lead to a sustainable recovery, says European economics commissioner Pierre Moscovici. Speaking as the country exits its bailout programme, he said: The extensive reforms Greece has carried out have laid the ground for a sustainable recovery: this must be nurtured and maintained to enable the Greek people to reap the benefits of their efforts and sacrifices. He said the Greek economy is expected to grow by around 2% after 1.4% growth last year. Back with Greece, and here is a link to the European summary of the main statistics: Here\u2019s our story on the tensions between Turkey and the US: President Tayyip Erdogan has been speaking again about the crisis which has laid low Turkey\u2019s currency and prompted a market sell-off. Reuters reports: [Erdogan] said on Monday an attack on Turkey\u2019s economy was no different from a strike against its flag or the Islamic call to prayer, responding to a recent currency sell-off in stark religious and nationalist terms ahead of a major Muslim holiday. In a pre-recorded address to mark the four-day Eid al-Adha festival, which starts on Tuesday, a defiant Erdogan said the aim of the currency crisis was to bring \u201cTurkey and its people to their knees\u201d. The lira has tumbled some 40 percent this year, hit by worries about Erdogan\u2019s influence over monetary policy and a worsening diplomatic rift with the United States. The sell-off has spread to other emerging market currencies and global stocks in recent weeks. Amid the tension, several gunshots were fired on Monday from a vehicle at the U.S. Embassy in the Turkish capital. Nobody was hurt. \u201cThe attack on our economy has absolutely no difference from attacks on our call to prayer and our flag. The goal is the same. The goal is to bring Turkey and the Turkish people to their knees - to take it prisoner,\u201d Erdogan said in the televised address. \u201cThose who think they can make Turkey give in with the exchange rate will soon see that they are mistaken.\u201d Erdogan stopped short of directly naming any countries or institutions, but he has, in the past, blamed a shadowy \u201cinterest rate lobby\u201d, Western ratings agencies and financiers. The lira is currently down around 1.5% against the dollar. Meanwhile a German government spokesman has said that it is up to Turkey to decide whether it wants to ask the International Monetary Fund for help. Markets are continuing to head higher, as investors shrug off the continuing concerns about Turkey and concentrate on the prospects for US-China trade talks. The FTSE 100 is up 0.55%, while Germany\u2019s Dax has added 0.93% and France\u2019s Cac has climbed 0.63%. Joshua Mahony, market analyst at IG, said: The fears of last week seem to have been washed away with a renewed optimism over the direction of US-China trade. Markets often find it difficult to focus on one topic, and thus with the focus now shifting away from Turkey and towards China, it comes as no surprise that the pessimism of last week is fading into obscurity. Wednesday will see a trade delegation from China kick off a two-day meeting with their US counterparts, and as long as there is hope for some form of breakthrough, markets are likely to be in a more optimistic mood. However, this optimism is likely to be ill-founded, for all the previous meetings have shown precious few signs of anything that looks like a breakthrough. As Greece exits its bailout, new government figures show a drop in the country\u2019s current account surplus compared to a year ago, but a rise in tourist revenues. Reuters reports: Greece\u2019s current account balance showed a smaller surplus in June compared to the same month a year earlier on the back of a wider trade deficit, the Bank of Greece said on Monday. Central bank data showed the surplus fell to 210 million euros ($240.18 million) from a surplus of 737 million euros in June 2017. Tourism revenues increased to 2.33 billion euros from 2.007 billion in the same month a year earlier. \u201cIn June the current account ... (was) down by 527 million euros year-on-year, as a result of a deterioration principally in the balance of goods and to a lesser extent in the primary income account,\u201d the Bank of Greece said. It said the trade gap rose by 535 million euros as imports outstripped exports, mainly the result of a worsening in the oil balance. In January to June, Greece\u2019s current account showed a deficit of 3.8 billion euros, up by 555 million euros year-on-year as the trade deficit widened and the primary income account surplus shrank. In 2017 as a whole, Greece\u2019s current account deficit reached 1.5 billion euros, down by 418 million year-on-year. And another reality check: Here\u2019s more on the forthcoming press conference on Greece: Back in the UK, and luxury handbag marker Mulberry has seen its shares slump 26% after it warned it would take a \u00a33m hit from House of Fraser\u2019s administration. Our full report is here: And G4S is down 1% after the UK ministry of justice took over HMP Birmingham from the company after drink, drugs and violence among prisoners: Over in Turkey and the lira has edged lower again, down 1.4% at 6.09 against the dollar. But this is a far cry from its all time worst level against the US currency of 7.24 which it hit at the start of last week as economic crisis unfolded. But the strain between Turkey and the US over the detention of a US pastor can be seen by the firing of gun shots at the American embassy in Ankara earlier this morning. Jamie McGeever at Reuters has a few sobering facts as Greece \u201creturns to normal\u201d: Markets in Europe are marginally better as traders return to their desks after the weekend break. The FTSE 100 is up 0.33%, France\u2019s Cac has climbed 0.32% and Germany\u2019s Dax is 0.34% better. Earlier Germany\u2019s produce price index rose by 3% year on year in July, the same level as the previous month and in line with expectations. Today Greece returns to normal, according to Portugal\u2019s finance minister and head of the eurogroup: Giorgos Papakonstantinou, who was finance minister when Greece signed up to the bailout, said he would do the same again if the country was in the same position. He told the BBC\u2019s Wake up to Money programme: The choice we had at that point was either to allow the country to go bankrupt by not paying our debts... at which point we would not have been able to pay salaries and pensions and provide basic public services. Or to sign a bailout which would give us time to reduce those deficits. But he admitted there had been tremendous pain and suffering along the way as austerity measures hit hard. And Zsolt Darvas of the Bruegel think tank said Greece could still face further problems. Speaking on BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme, he said: Unfortunately I give a high probability that Greece will enter a new crisis three to five years from now, partly because Greece still has a very high level of debt and it has to repay a lot in the near term. If Greece\u2019s growth slows down long-term, then markets might become very nervous and Greece will enter a new crisis. European markets are expected to make a mixed start to the week: Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. It\u2019s a momentous day for Greece and its government led by prime minister Alexis Tsipras. After eight years and innumerable late night eurozone crisis meetings, the country is exiting its bailout programme. The so-called troika of creditors - the European Union, the European Central Bank and the International Monetary Fund loaned Greece a total of \u20ac289bn in three tranches in 2010, 2012 and 2015. The country is now free to borrow money on the capital markets, something it has not been able to do while the bailout programme was underway. But it has suffered under tough austerity measures demanded by its creditors, and everyone involved understands there is still a long way to go. Here is our report on the news: Later this morning Pierre Moscovici, the EU\u2019s economic affairs commissioner, is expected to hail Greece\u2019s exit from the bailout. But our economics editor Larry Elliott says the programme has been a failure: It is a tale of incompetence, of dogma, of needless delay and of the interests of banks being put before the needs of people. And there will be long-term consequences. When Greece first received help in 2010, the plan was for it to have access to the financial markets within two years. It has taken two further rescue packages and six years for that to happen. His full analysis is here: Elsewhere Turkey is likely to remain in focus after the recent collapse of the lira and concerns that its economic problems will spread elsewhere. David Madden, market analyst at CMC Markets UK, said: The slump in the Turkish lira is on traders\u2019 minds as the fear of contagion into the eurozone is likely to remain a dominant theme. It was reported that emerging market funds were already trimming their exposure to the country in July, and that was even before the severe decline in the lira. Over the weekend, the central banks of Qatar and Turkey signed a currency swap agreement, and this follows on from the $15 billion that the gulf state pledged to invest in the country. Dealers are still scared that banks that have lent money to Turkish finance houses could face defaults, and it is possible we might see an increase in non-performing loans in the Turkish banking system, and that could seep into the eurozone. Jasper Lawler, head of research at London Capital Group, says there could be more volatility ahead: Turkish markets are closed this week, which means volumes will be particularly low, therefore big swigs could be expected potentially unnerving traders once again. On a more positive note, traders are hopeful that a planned meeting this week between Chinese and US representatives may ease some of the trade war fears that have overshadowed the markets in recent months.",

Regardless of your view on the rights or wrongs of what the US is doing to Turkey financially, with Trump as President, it certainly doesn\u2019t pay to mess with the US, especially when you upset the evangelical wing of the US this close to the mid-terms. </p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5b7aafd0e4b00f6a2ff7f99f\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/helenasmith\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-08-20T12:15:47.352Z\">1.15pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Meanwhile in Athens it has not gone unnoticed that Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras has chosen to remain silent about Greece\u2019s much-awaited bailout exit, <em>writes Helena Smith from Athens</em>. His only public utterance today has been to tweet his congratulations to the county\u2019s youth water polo team on its world championship victory.</p> <p>Has this got something to do, perhaps, with the fact that his leftist-led government has signed up to a staggering array of ambitious targets? Post\u2013bailout Greece has committed to produce primary surpluses of 3.5 % of GDP until 2022 \u2013 a feat achieved by only a handful of countries since the seventies - and 2.2 % until 2060.</p> <p>For professor Kevin Featherstone who has followed the twists and turns of the crisis as head of the Hellenic Observatory at the London School of Economics, such obligations amount to perpetual purgatory.</p> <p>\u201cNo other government in Europe would choose to follow this path. It is Ordoliberalism gone wild,\u201d he told the Guardian. </p> <p>With the fiscal straightjacket remaining so tight, there will be little scope for future administrations to improve economic competitiveness through investment, or accelerate social support for those pauperised by austerity. </p> <p>\u201cRehabilitation falls well short,\u201d Professor Featherstone said. \u201cThe prospect of a recurrence of the debt crisis has been eliminated but nothing has been done to help Greek society overcome the trauma of excessively high unemployment and bankruptcies.\u201d </p> <p>Tsipras had hoped to mark the exit with a visit to Kastelorizo, the remote Aegean isle where the drama began. Celebrating Greece\u2019s \u2018liberation\u2019 in the place where former Prime Minister George Papandreou had in April 2010 first announced that Athens would seek help from the EU and IMF \u2013 after surging Greek bond yields made borrowing on capital markets prohibitive - seemed appropriate to coming full-circle. </p> <p>But the outcry over his government\u2019s handling of last month\u2019s wildfires \u2013 a calamity that has left 94 dead and brought devastation and ruination to hundreds more \u2013 put paid to the idea. Fanfare, aides say, will be kept to a minimum. </p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5b7aab3de4b00f6a2ff7f968\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-08-20T11:56:26.931Z\">12.56pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The chief economist of the ESM rescue fund has admitted there were mistakes made with Greece.</p> <p>In an interview with CNBC Rolf Strauch said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>This was a severe crisis situation and obviously it\u2019s difficult to claim that everything went well in the sense that everything was completely right at the time.

Reforms have the feature that it takes a bit until you see the impact and so the benefits of the reforms weren\u2019t occurring right at the start or right from the moment when they were taken, but they are coming in now and I think this process will continue.

Unemployment is still about 20%, and youth unemployment is more than double that. Despite undertaking the biggest post-crisis fiscal adjustment of any euro zone country, Greece\u2019s public debt is equal to about 180% of GDP. ESM fiscal and structural reform policies, to which Greece will remain subject after the third economic adjustment programme expires, are unlikely to generate sufficient economic growth to mitigate the country\u2019s debt burden or reduce popular disaffection. Grexit is not a short-term risk, but Greece will struggle to improve competitiveness inside the euro area or grow its way out of its huge debt burden (179.1% of GDP in 2017), so it will remain a significant risk over the medium and long term.</p> <p>The past eight years of bailouts have exacted a high cost in per capita GDP, employment, wages, pensions, living standards, life satisfaction and social and political cohesion. Greece has lowest life satisfaction rating of any OECD country. Divisions of income, equality, class and politics have sharpened. Greek sovereignty and democracy undermined as the country became subject to external tutelage. There is no popular enthusiasm for any party: popular cynicism and disaffection reign.</p> <p>Greece has been benefiting from cyclical upswing in the euro zone in 2017-18; and tourism and merchandise exports have also performing well. These factors will remain important, and point to stronger real GDP growth of around 2% this year, after 1.3% growth in 2017. However, Greece faces formidable medium- and long-term challenges, including a very poor demographic outlook; a dysfunctional labour market and a huge emigration of Greeks during the past decade; still weak public finances; poor banking asset quality; closed professions; bad regulation; and an unsustainable public debt load. These structural weakness, together with a commitment to deliver annual primary budget surplus targets of 3.5% of GDP in 2018-22 and of 2% of GDP in 2023- 2060 will shackle growth.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5b7a9472e4b0f6601fba18c3\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-08-20T10:27:15.829Z\">11.27am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Greek reforms laid groundwork for sustainable recovery - Moscovici</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The austerity measures undertaken by Greece will lead to a sustainable recovery, says European economics commissioner Pierre Moscovici.</p> <p>Speaking as the country exits its bailout programme, he said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The extensive reforms Greece has carried out have laid the ground for a sustainable recovery: this must be nurtured and maintained to enable the Greek people to reap the benefits of their efforts and sacrifices.</p> </blockquote> <p>He said the Greek economy is expected to grow by around 2% after 1.4% growth last year.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/LiveSquawk/status/1031481875032944640\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">EU&#39;s Moscovici Says Greece Must Ensure Continued Implementation Of Reforms<br>EU&#39;s Moscovici Says Greek Economic Growth Expected To Remain Around 2Pct In 2018, 2019</p>&mdash; LiveSquawk (@LiveSquawk) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/LiveSquawk/status/1031481875032944640?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">August 20, 2018</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5b7a9576e4b00f6a2ff7f86b\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-08-20T10:19:23.314Z\">11.19am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Back with Greece, and here is a link to the European summary of the main statistics:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/A_Breidthardt/status/1031483068421431296\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">The conclusion of Greece&#39;s stability support programme opens the door to a new chapter for Greece.

After eight years and innumerable late night eurozone crisis meetings, the country is exiting its bailout programme. The so-called troika of creditors - the European Union, the European Central Bank and the International Monetary Fund loaned Greece a total of \u20ac289bn in three tranches in 2010, 2012 and 2015.</p> <p>The country is now free to borrow money on the capital markets, something it has not been able to do while the bailout programme was underway. But it has suffered under tough austerity measures demanded by its creditors, and everyone involved understands there is still a long way to go.</p> <p>Here is our report on the news:</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/aug/20/greece-emerges-from-eurozone-bailout-after-years-of-austerity\">Greece emerges from eurozone bailout after years of austerity</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Later this morning Pierre Moscovici, the EU\u2019s economic affairs commissioner, is expected to hail Greece\u2019s exit from the bailout. But our economics editor Larry Elliott says the programme has been a failure:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It is a tale of incompetence, of dogma, of needless delay and of the interests of banks being put before the needs of people. And there will be long-term consequences. When Greece first received help in 2010, the plan was for it to have access to the financial markets within two years. It has taken two further rescue packages and six years for that to happen.</p> </blockquote> <p>His full analysis is here:</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/aug/19/greeces-bailout-is-finally-at-an-end-but-has-been-a-failure\">Greece's bailout is finally at an end \u2013 but has been a failure | Larry Elliott</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Elsewhere Turkey is likely to remain in focus after the recent collapse of the lira and concerns that its economic problems will spread elsewhere. David Madden, market analyst at CMC Markets UK, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The slump in the Turkish lira is on traders\u2019 minds as the fear of contagion into the eurozone is likely to remain a dominant theme. It was reported that emerging market funds were already trimming their exposure to the country in July, and that was even before the severe decline in the lira. Over the weekend, the central banks of Qatar and Turkey signed a currency swap agreement, and this follows on from the $15 billion that the gulf state pledged to invest in the country. Dealers are still scared that banks that have lent money to Turkish finance houses could face defaults, and it is possible we might see an increase in non-performing loans in the Turkish banking system, and that could seep into the eurozone. </p> </blockquote> <p>Jasper Lawler, head of research at London Capital Group, says there could be more volatility ahead:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Turkish markets are closed this week, which means volumes will be particularly low, therefore big swigs could be expected potentially unnerving traders once again.</p> </blockquote> <p>On a more positive note, traders are hopeful that a planned meeting this week between Chinese and US representatives may ease some of the trade war fears that have overshadowed the markets in recent months.</p> </div>   </div>",

      "bodyText": "The Labour party has condemned proposals by former Lehman Brothers staff to hold a reunion to mark the 10th anniversary of the firm going bust \u2013 a defining moment in the 2008 financial crisis. John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, said that people who suffered during the decade of austerity following the crash would be \u201cabsolutely disgusted\u201d by the revelation that the get-together was going ahead. His comment was prompted by a Financial News report saying staff who worked for the investment bank, which employed about 5,000 people in the UK, had received an email inviting them to an event to \u201ccelebrate\u201d the anniversary. Addressed to \u201cLehman Brothers &amp; Sisters\u201d, the email says: \u201cIt\u2019s hard to believe it\u2019s been 10 years since the last of our Lehman days! ... One of the best things about Lehman was the people. What better way to celebrate the tenth anniversary than getting everyone from former MDs to former analysts back together again!\u201d According to Financial News, about 200 former employees are expected to attend the party, which will take place at an undisclosed location in London around the time of the 10th anniversary of Lehman filing for bankruptcy on 15 September 2008. The organisers are said to be aware of how controversial the event will be and are keen to keep the details secret. McDonnell said the reunion should not be going ahead. \u201cThis is absolutely sickening after a decade of people suffering austerity,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cIt\u2019s particularly disgraceful in the context of all the people who lost their jobs and homes to pay for bailing out these bankers who caused the financial crash, as well as against a backdrop of firefighters, police officers and other public servants facing years of brutal Tory pay restraint. People will be absolutely disgusted about this unacceptable and highly inappropriate gathering.\u201d Other Lehman reunions are reportedly being organised in New York and in Hong Kong. Lehman Brothers was the fourth largest investment bank in America when it collapsed in the largest bankruptcy in US history and its downfall exacerbated a global banking crisis caused by reckless lending. Subsequently governments all over the world spend billions of dollars bailing out other banks, with consequences for public spending still being felt a decade later. Dennis Grainger, chairman of the Northern Rock Action Group at the UK Shareholders Association, said the Lehman reunion was \u201cin very bad taste\u201d.",

      "bodyText": "Countrywide has scrapped a pay plan that could have handed its top executives more than \u00a320m after a shareholder revolt. Earlier this month the beleaguered estate agent group, which has nearly 10,700 staff and operates under about 50 brand names including Hamptons International and Bairstow Eves, was forced to ask investors for \u00a3140m in emergency funds to save it from collapsing under the weight of its debt. Shareholders will vote on the cash call next week, as part of what Countrywide is calling its \u201cAbsolute Growth Plan\u201d (AGP), which also includes pushing through a new incentive scheme. Under the proposed scheme top executives including the chairman, Peter Long, whose role changed to an executive position following the ousting of former chief executive Alison Platt, could have received Countrywide shares worth more than \u00a320m. Countrywide\u2019s proposals to replace its existing long-term incentive plan with AGP sparked a furious response from shareholders. Institutional Shareholder Services, an influential investor advisory service, said investors should oppose the new policy and labelled the scheme \u201cexcessive\u201d and \u201cunnecessarily convoluted\u201d. \u201cNo compelling explanation has been provided as to why the proposed arrangement is essential to effectively implementing the group\u2019s strategy and turnaround plan,\u201d ISS said. While Countrywide was expected to be able to push through the scheme \u2013 its largest shareholder Oaktree Capital was reportedly set to back the proposals \u2013 the company has decided to avoid a clash with investors by dropping the pay plans. \u201cThe consultation meetings on remuneration with the major shareholders have been both constructive and supportive,\u201d the company said. \u201cThere has been agreement that the proposals focus on rebuilding shareholder value as well as discussion as to whether that is sufficient to merit moving from the existing remuneration policy. Taking these factors into consideration, the board has decided that the directors\u2019 remuneration policy should not be amended.\u201d The decision to drop the new incentive scheme will save Long, who also chairs Royal Mail, from a second humiliating run-in with investors in as many months. In July, more than 70% of Royal Mail investors rebelled against the company\u2019s remuneration report, one of the biggest pay revolts in UK corporate history. Long, who is also vice-chairman of travel group Tui, saw almost a third of disgruntled Royal Mail investors vote against his re-election as chairman. Countrywide has lost more than 80% of its market value over the past year as the housing market cooled.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The luxury handbag maker Mulberry has warned that it faces a slump in profits after taking a \u00a33m hit from House of Fraser\u2019s collapse into administration. Mulberry, which has already reported struggling sales as wealthy tourists favour Paris and Milan over London, operates 21 concessions in House of Fraser, employing 88 staff. Shares in the group slumped 30% to 400p in early trading, before recovering to about 470p, a 17% decline, by lunchtime on Monday. Mulberry said the collapse of the department store group would cost it \u00a33m in the six months to 30 September. Mike Ashley\u2019s Sports Direct, which bought the House of Fraser out of administration, is not obliged to pay the near-\u00a31bn owed to creditors at the time of its collapse. Mulberry also warned investors that it continued to face a sales slowdown that would hammer profits in its current financial year to the end of next March. \u201cThe UK market has continued to remain challenging and sales in House of Fraser stores have particularly been affected,\u201d the company said. \u201cIf these sales trends continue into the key trading period of the second half of the financial year, the group\u2019s profit for the whole year will be materially reduced.\u201d The company reported a \u00a36.9m pretax profit in its last financial year, a drop from \u00a37.5m after \u00a32m of startup charges and \u00a32.4m of operating costs relating to its new Asia subsidiaries such as Mulberry Korea. In the past year the luxury brand also created new entities in China, Hong Kong, Taiwan and Japan as it seeks to capitalise on Asia\u2019s increasing number of middle-class shoppers. \u201cTrading in the rest of the world continues to develop broadly in line with management\u2019s expectations,\u201d the company said. \u201cThe group is in a strong cash position and continues to follow its strategy to develop Mulberry into a global luxury brand.\u201d Mulberry\u2019s bestselling bag is the Amberley, launched last year with prices starting from about \u00a3500 for a small satchel. Approximately 70% of Mulberry\u2019s sales are in the UK. In June, Thierry Andretta, its chief executive, said that while the company was \u201ctotally committed\u201d to the UK market, he hopedthe split between UK and international sales would be closer to 50/50 in the long term. Mulberry is one of more than 1,000 suppliers that will not receive payments owed by House of Fraser, and is the first with a concession to publicly confirm the financial impact of the chain\u2019s collapse. \u201cIt will be interesting to see if other House of Fraser concession operators, like [sofa and carpet retailer] ScS and [fashion brand] QUIZ also come out and try to quantify the damage,\u201d said Nick Bubb, an independent retail analyst. A report from administrators EY showed a range of fashion and beauty brands have been significantly left out of pocket, including Tommy Hilfiger (owed \u00a33.3m), Barbour (\u00a33m), Mint Velvet (\u00a32.5m), L\u2019Oreal (\u00a32m) and Pretty Green (\u00a3500,000), the label launched by the former Oasis frontman Liam Gallagher. But analysts point out that Mulberry\u2019s sales woes relate more to the wider issue of retailing in the digital age. \u201cExclusive brands like Mulberry are having difficulties adapting to the new trading environment because they rely so heavily on the personal experience they offer to their customers,\u201d said Artjom Hatsaturjants, a research analyst at Accendo Markets. \u201cIn effect, what Mulberry is saying is that not only can it quantify direct losses it will suffer now, but that these losses could be compounded further by the same troubles that have been plaguing the UK retails market: changing consumer preferences, lack of significant differentiation between major brands, unyielding Brexit uncertainty and intense competition from online fashion retailers such as Asos and Boohoo.\u201d A recent report from advisory firm BDO suggested that bricks and mortar retailers endured the worst first half-year of trading in at least 12 years. Well established chains including New Look, Marks &amp; Spencer and Carpetright have all been forced to close dozens of shops, while the John Lewis Partnership issued a profit warning and said it would shut five Waitrose stores because of tough trading on the high street. Online retail giant Amazon\u2019s UK revenues for 2017 rose by almost 20% year-on-year to $11.3bn (\u00a38.9bn).",
