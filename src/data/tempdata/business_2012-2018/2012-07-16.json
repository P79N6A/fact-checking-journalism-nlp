      "bodyText": "The International Monetary Fund has downgraded its forecast for UK growth this year by more than any other developed nation and warned that the world economy is weakening. The Washington-based organisation predicted on Monday that growth in the UK will all but evaporate in 2012 with a rise in GDP of just 0.2%, compared with a previous forecast of 0.8%. The IMF said in its latest World Economic Outlook that GDP across the UK \u2013 which is currently in recession \u2013 will increase by 1.4% in 2013 \u2013 a 0.6 percentage point cut from its previous 2% forecast. Only Spain has a bigger downgrade next year after the IMF said it will lose 0.7 percentage points and maintain its run of recessions for a third 12-month period. As if to emphasise the panic gripping international debt markets and the race to put savings worth trillions of pounds in safe havens, US government bonds gained in popularity and Spanish interest rates climbed back towards previous highs associated with a Greek-style collapse. US five-year bonds fell to record lows while the benchmark 10-year yield fell four basis points to 1.45%. Christine Lagarde, the former French finance minister who heads the IMF, has warned European leaders they must press ahead with further measures to deal with the euro crisis or growth forecasts could prove optimistic. The IMF said in its latest report that without action to stimulate growth in emerging economies in Asia and South America, global growth could also suffer, while in the US the Obama administration needs to revitalise an economy that is hitting the buffers. In a statement it said: \"Clearly, downside risks continue to loom large, importantly reflecting risks of delayed or insufficient policy action. \"In Europe, the measures announced at the European Union (EU) leaders' summit in June are steps in the right direction. The very recent renewed deterioration of sovereign debt markets underscores that timely implementation of these measures, together with further progress on banking and fiscal union, must be a priority. \"In the United States, avoiding the fiscal cliff, promptly raising the debt ceiling, and developing a medium-term fiscal plan are of the essence. In emerging market economies, policymakers should be ready to cope with trade declines and the high volatility of capital flows.\" Ed Balls MP, Labour's shadow chancellor, in response to the IMF's revised forecasts for the UK economy, said the forecasts were evidence the government's economic plan has failed. \"Last autumn the IMF forecast growth of just 1.6% this year and warned that if those expectations were undershot, the government should take urgent action to boost the economy including temporary tax cuts and more investment in infrastructure. \"Less than a year on, the IMF is now forecasting growth of just 0.2% this year and Britain is one of just two G20 countries in a double-dip recession. And the recession means borrowing is now going up.\" The Bank of England and the the Treasury's fiscal advisory body, the Office for Budget Responsibility, still forecast that the UK is likely to grow at 2% next year. Both organisations will be under pressure to follow the IMF's downgrade to 1.4%. The first estimate of UK growth in the second quarter of this year is due from the Office for National Statistics next Wednesday. The significance of the downgrade is that low growth, while ending the recession, will prolong the longest depression in the last 100 years and will be insufficient to cut unemployment significantly. Britain is still more than 4% below the level of GDP recorded in 2007 and about 12% below the trajectory set before the financial crisis. UK bankruptcy rates increased among larger firms, according to a report by Experian, which found that businesses with more than 100 employees experienced an increase in the rate of insolvencies compared to June 2011. The West Midlands was badly affected. Overall 650 businesses became insolvent in June 2012, compared with 1,841 in May 2012 and 1,783 in June 2011. A Treasury spokesman said the IMF supported the government's view that the eurozone crisis was to blame for most of the UK's woes. \"Because the euro area is the UK's largest trading partner we are now feeling the effect across our economy. But as the chancellor said last week, we are not powerless to act in the face of the European debt storm: that's why the Treasury and the Bank of England are taking co-ordinated action to inject new confidence and support the flow of credit to where it is needed in the real economy,\" he said. Overall, the IMF moderated its projections for global growth to 3.5% in 2012 and 3.9% in 2013. Many other forecasters have argued the slowdown in the US and China will have a larger than expected drag on world trade and growth. France fares little better than the UK this year with growth of 0.3%, but like most euro area countries is projected to suffer a shock next year with growth of just 0.8%. German GDP growth also declines from this year to next. Italy and Spain will remain in recession next year, according to the IMF, placing a question mark over their ability to refinance their banks and generate sufficient goodwill from international lenders to prevent them from going bust. Fears that Spain and Italy will need a bailout from Brussels continue to weigh on global growth following the reluctance of Germany, Finland, Holland and Austria to sanction a fund capable of handling both countries.",

      "body": "<!-- Block 1 --> <p>3.49pm: Good afternoon and welcome to our live blog. Jerry del Missier, a Canadian, is the latest to be hauled before the Treasury select committee to talk about the Libor rigging scandal. He quit just hours after Bob Diamond, the Barclays chief executive, resigned after the \u00a3290m fine hammered the bank's share price and its reputation. The two men were close at Barclays Capital, the investment banking arm, and del Missier had been promoted only three weeks ago to chief operating officer for the entire bank.</p> <p>Del Missier is also caught up in the controversial memo written by Diamond on October 29 2008 after a conversation with Bank of England governor Paul Tucker. Here is the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/jul/03/barclays-bank-of-england-email\">memo</a>.<br> In the memo Diamond, who then ran BarCap, tells del Missier and the then-chief executive John Varley that Tucker was concerned about the bank's Libor levels during the crisis and Del Missier interprets the memo as a tacit signal to cut the submission to the Libor panel. Del Missier, who was investigated by the Financial Services Authority but no charges were brought, instructed the bank's submitters to cut the interest rate. He is likely to be asked why he interpreted Diamond's memo the way he did and whether or not he had asked Diamond for guidance. [When Diamond was asked at his appearance before MPs he said he could not put himself in Del Missier's shoes.]</p> <p>The session is scheduled to run from 1600 to 1645 when Lord Turner, chairman of the Financial Services Authority, will appear alongside Andrew Bailey, the FSA's top banking regulator and Tracey McDermott, the acting head of enforcement (and responsible for the fine).</p> <p>Turner is likely to face a grilling about when he found out about Libor and crucially why it was Sir Mervyn King, Bank of England governor, who told Barclays that Diamond had to leave and not Turner, whose FSA actually regulates the banks.</p> <!-- Block 2 --> <p>4.07pm: We're still waiting for the testimony to start....</p> <!-- Block 3 --> <p>4.11pm: Here we go, Jerry del Missier is first up in front of the committee.</p> <!-- Block 4 --> <p>4.12pm: Del Missier says the Libor rate at the time was \"hugely, hugely subjective\". He talks about the context, describing it as a \"period of severe escalation\" post the Lehman Brothers collapse, with an \"unprecedented degree of government intervention in the financial system\".</p> <!-- Block 5 --> <p>4.18pm: \"This was not the first time Libor had come up as an issue,\" says del Missier. He has also talked about the phone call he received from his boss Bob Diamond in October 2008, who told him that the Bank of England was putting pressure on the bank to get Libor rates down. The Bank in turn was coming under pressure from Whitehall.</p> <!-- Block 6 --> <p>4.21pm: Del Missier is being asked, repeatedly (in Jeremy Paxman style), by Tory MP David Ruffley whether lowballing of Libor is an illegal activity. \"It's not a yes or no answer,\" says del Missier.</p> <!-- Block 7 --> <p>4.22pm: \"The manipulation of Libor is illegal,\" according to guidelines by the US Department of Justice read out by Ruffley, del Missier admits finally. But he adds he didn't believe it was an inappropriate act at the time. \"At the time it seemed appropriate given everything that was going on.\"</p> <!-- Block 8 --> <p>4.24pm: Del Missier instructed Barclays' submitters to cut the interest rate. He says he gave the instruction to the head of the money market desk, and admits he didn't follow up on the instruction to see whether it was being followed. He says it was an instruction from Bob Diamond to lowball the libor rates, following his conversation with Paul Tucker at the Bank of England.</p> <!-- Block 9 --> <p>4.27pm: Our banking correspondent <strong>Jill Treanor</strong> sums up the action so far:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Del Missier has kicked off by talking about a conversation he had with Diamond the day before that controversial memo which cost him his job. Diamond made no mention of having spoken to del Missier about this when he appeared before the committee when all would say was that he could not put himself in del Missier's shoes.</p> </blockquote> <!-- Block 10 --> <p>4.29pm: \"I regret the fact that Barclays' reputation has been sullied\" by the Libor scandal, says del Missier. He agrees in retrospect that \"lowballing\" of Libor rates was improper, although he didn't think so at the time. He believed he was acting on an instruction from the Bank of England to lower Libor.</p> <!-- Block 11 --> <p>4.39pm: Del Missier says he had \"regular communication\" with Bob Diamond.</p> <!-- Block 12 --> <p>4.41pm: \"Were you aware that they were doing it from 2007 onwards?\" del Missier is asked by MP George Mudie. \"The traders were doing it to improve profits at Barclays,\" says Mudie.</p> <!-- Block 13 --> <p>4.48pm: Del Missier claims between 2005 and the autumn of 2008, he had no knowledge of rigging of rates. \"I was not aware there was any sort of pressure applied to any of the Libor submitters in 2007. I first found out about that in late 2009, early 2010 as the investigation went on I became aware of the scale.\"</p> <!-- Block 14 --> <p>4.55pm: He says his instruction to the money desk at Barclays to submit lower Libor rates only lasted for days - it wasn't open-ended. He wasn't aware of other market manipulation at the bank.</p> <!-- Block 15 --> <p>5.05pm: Del Missier admits the rigging was \"regrettable\". He regrets the \"control breakdowns\".</p> <!-- Block 16 --> <p>5.09pm: Del Missier denies he is \"acting as a fall guy\" for Bob Diamond. \"I'm not the fall guy for anything. This happened to the bank, and I resigned as a result of it.\"</p> <!-- Block 17 --> <p>5.12pm: He is not aware he is under investigation by any regulatory authority in the UK or US. He says the FSA cleared him of any wrongdoing related to the Libor investigation.</p> <!-- Block 18 --> <p>5.13pm: \"I can understand... that there is resentment towards Barclays and the banks,\" he says.</p> <!-- Block 19 --> <p>5.22pm: The first bonus-related question, from Tory MP Andrea Leadsom. But she doesn't get much of an answer and doesn't follow up. Del Missier is asked how much his bonus depends on good controls. He is asked for a percentage, but says he was never told.</p> <!-- Block 20 --> <p>5.23pm: Del Missier says the <strong>money market desk informed the bank's compliance unit of the request to reduce Libor rates</strong>, but compliance didn't follow up with him or anyone in senior management.</p> <!-- Block 21 --> <p>5.26pm: Right, del Missier is allowed to go. The FSA guys are next. During the break, here's a quick missive from Jill Treanor, our banking correspondent:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>So Del Missier is now naming names and providing new information about the Libor scandal. Mark Dearlove, head of the money markets desk, is the person he told to cut Libor rates. Dearlove, or someone on the money market desk, told the compliance department, then headed by Stephen Morse, that they were being asked to cut Libor submissions.<br>According to del Missier there was no response from compliance. According to the <a href=\"http://www.fsa.gov.uk/register/indivBasicDetails.do?sid=500588\">FSA register</a> Morse is currently \"inactive\"</p> </blockquote> <!-- Block 22 --> <p>5.38pm: Lord Turner, chairman of the Financial Services Authority, Andrew Bailey, the FSA's top banking regulator and Tracey McDermott, the acting head of enforcement (and responsible for the Barclays fine) are now being grilled by MPs.</p> <!-- Block 23 --> <p>5.40pm: Bailey says at the time of the February board meeting there were a whole series of issues with Barclays, but there was no impression that Bob Diamond was personally involved.</p> <!-- Block 24 --> <p>5.41pm: \"There was a culture of gaming, and gaming us,\" says Bailey. \"It had to change.\"</p> <p>Asked whether \"the regulator had had enough?\" Bailey replies: \"Yes.\"</p> <!-- Block 25 --> <p>5.43pm: You can read the letters between Barclays chairman Marcus Agius and the Financial Services Authority <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/interactive/2012/jul/10/barclays-libor-scandal-correspondence?intcmp=239\">here</a>.</p> <!-- Block 26 --> <p>5.45pm: Bailey says Diamond \"did not capture the severity of the issue\" in his answers to MPs at at an earlier committee hearing.</p> <!-- Block 27 --> <p>5.46pm: The minutes from the Barclays board meeting on 9 February say resolving the perception of an aggressive culture is \"critical to the future of the group\".</p> <!-- Block 28 --> <p>5.53pm: <strong>Bailey says he never had a conversation with a bank like the one he had with Barclays.</strong> \"Barclays was an outlier.\"</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>You couldn't escape the fact that the culture of this institution was coming from the top.</p> </blockquote> <!-- Block 29 --> <p>6.02pm: Steve Hawkes, business editor of the Sun, has just tweeted this:</p> <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"> <p>TSC have called Andrew Bailey Anrew on his name plate ... that can't be blamed on Barclays</p> <p>\u2014 steve hawkes (@steve_hawkes) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/steve_hawkes/status/224908491826012161\" data-datetime=\"2012-07-16T16:48:57+00:00\">July 16, 2012</a></p> </blockquote> <!-- Block 30 --> <p>6.05pm: Tracey McDermott, the FSA's acting head of enforcement, says it was widely known in 2007 and 2008 that the libor market was not operating in the way it had previously done.</p> <!-- Block 31 --> <p>6.09pm: Turner is asked: \"Is this the tip of the iceberg?\" [in relation to market abuse]</p> <p>\"We don't know... but <strong>I would be amazed if this was everything</strong>,\" he replies.</p> <!-- Block 32 --> <p>6.14pm: Turner describes Libor to the \"frog in the boiling water story\". </p> <p>\"We did have, we never used the word, a somewhat light touch to regulation, in particular in those areas of wholesale conduct,\" he admits. The FSA only had five people on Barclays and five on RBS, and at one stage only had one person shared between Barclays and RBS. The focus was only to a \"small extent\" on investment banks.</p> <!-- Block 33 --> <p>6.49pm: David Ruffley is pressing on why the FSA has not undertaken any criminal investigations. \"We do not take the lead in prosecuting general fraud events,\" reiterates McDermott. Turner said earlier that the FSA has been in contact with the Serious Fraud Office throughout the Libor investigation.</p> <!-- Block 34 --> <p>6.52pm: McDermott says the FSA has used its criminal prosecution powers in insider dealing cases, but doesn't have such powers in the Libor rigging case.

      "bodyText": "3.49pm: Good afternoon and welcome to our live blog. Jerry del Missier, a Canadian, is the latest to be hauled before the Treasury select committee to talk about the Libor rigging scandal. He quit just hours after Bob Diamond, the Barclays chief executive, resigned after the \u00a3290m fine hammered the bank's share price and its reputation. The two men were close at Barclays Capital, the investment banking arm, and del Missier had been promoted only three weeks ago to chief operating officer for the entire bank. Del Missier is also caught up in the controversial memo written by Diamond on October 29 2008 after a conversation with Bank of England governor Paul Tucker. Here is the memo. In the memo Diamond, who then ran BarCap, tells del Missier and the then-chief executive John Varley that Tucker was concerned about the bank's Libor levels during the crisis and Del Missier interprets the memo as a tacit signal to cut the submission to the Libor panel. Del Missier, who was investigated by the Financial Services Authority but no charges were brought, instructed the bank's submitters to cut the interest rate. He is likely to be asked why he interpreted Diamond's memo the way he did and whether or not he had asked Diamond for guidance. [When Diamond was asked at his appearance before MPs he said he could not put himself in Del Missier's shoes.] The session is scheduled to run from 1600 to 1645 when Lord Turner, chairman of the Financial Services Authority, will appear alongside Andrew Bailey, the FSA's top banking regulator and Tracey McDermott, the acting head of enforcement (and responsible for the fine). Turner is likely to face a grilling about when he found out about Libor and crucially why it was Sir Mervyn King, Bank of England governor, who told Barclays that Diamond had to leave and not Turner, whose FSA actually regulates the banks. 4.07pm: We're still waiting for the testimony to start.... 4.11pm: Here we go, Jerry del Missier is first up in front of the committee. 4.12pm: Del Missier says the Libor rate at the time was \"hugely, hugely subjective\". He talks about the context, describing it as a \"period of severe escalation\" post the Lehman Brothers collapse, with an \"unprecedented degree of government intervention in the financial system\". 4.18pm: \"This was not the first time Libor had come up as an issue,\" says del Missier. He has also talked about the phone call he received from his boss Bob Diamond in October 2008, who told him that the Bank of England was putting pressure on the bank to get Libor rates down. The Bank in turn was coming under pressure from Whitehall. 4.21pm: Del Missier is being asked, repeatedly (in Jeremy Paxman style), by Tory MP David Ruffley whether lowballing of Libor is an illegal activity. \"It's not a yes or no answer,\" says del Missier. 4.22pm: \"The manipulation of Libor is illegal,\" according to guidelines by the US Department of Justice read out by Ruffley, del Missier admits finally. But he adds he didn't believe it was an inappropriate act at the time. \"At the time it seemed appropriate given everything that was going on.\" 4.24pm: Del Missier instructed Barclays' submitters to cut the interest rate. He says he gave the instruction to the head of the money market desk, and admits he didn't follow up on the instruction to see whether it was being followed. He says it was an instruction from Bob Diamond to lowball the libor rates, following his conversation with Paul Tucker at the Bank of England. 4.27pm: Our banking correspondent Jill Treanor sums up the action so far: Del Missier has kicked off by talking about a conversation he had with Diamond the day before that controversial memo which cost him his job. Diamond made no mention of having spoken to del Missier about this when he appeared before the committee when all would say was that he could not put himself in del Missier's shoes. 4.29pm: \"I regret the fact that Barclays' reputation has been sullied\" by the Libor scandal, says del Missier. He agrees in retrospect that \"lowballing\" of Libor rates was improper, although he didn't think so at the time. He believed he was acting on an instruction from the Bank of England to lower Libor. 4.39pm: Del Missier says he had \"regular communication\" with Bob Diamond. 4.41pm: \"Were you aware that they were doing it from 2007 onwards?\" del Missier is asked by MP George Mudie. \"The traders were doing it to improve profits at Barclays,\" says Mudie. 4.48pm: Del Missier claims between 2005 and the autumn of 2008, he had no knowledge of rigging of rates. \"I was not aware there was any sort of pressure applied to any of the Libor submitters in 2007. I first found out about that in late 2009, early 2010 as the investigation went on I became aware of the scale.\" 4.55pm: He says his instruction to the money desk at Barclays to submit lower Libor rates only lasted for days - it wasn't open-ended. He wasn't aware of other market manipulation at the bank. 5.05pm: Del Missier admits the rigging was \"regrettable\". He regrets the \"control breakdowns\". 5.09pm: Del Missier denies he is \"acting as a fall guy\" for Bob Diamond. \"I'm not the fall guy for anything. This happened to the bank, and I resigned as a result of it.\" 5.12pm: He is not aware he is under investigation by any regulatory authority in the UK or US. He says the FSA cleared him of any wrongdoing related to the Libor investigation. 5.13pm: \"I can understand... that there is resentment towards Barclays and the banks,\" he says. 5.22pm: The first bonus-related question, from Tory MP Andrea Leadsom. But she doesn't get much of an answer and doesn't follow up. Del Missier is asked how much his bonus depends on good controls. He is asked for a percentage, but says he was never told. 5.23pm: Del Missier says the money market desk informed the bank's compliance unit of the request to reduce Libor rates, but compliance didn't follow up with him or anyone in senior management. 5.26pm: Right, del Missier is allowed to go. The FSA guys are next. During the break, here's a quick missive from Jill Treanor, our banking correspondent: So Del Missier is now naming names and providing new information about the Libor scandal. Mark Dearlove, head of the money markets desk, is the person he told to cut Libor rates. Dearlove, or someone on the money market desk, told the compliance department, then headed by Stephen Morse, that they were being asked to cut Libor submissions. According to del Missier there was no response from compliance. According to the FSA register Morse is currently \"inactive\" 5.38pm: Lord Turner, chairman of the Financial Services Authority, Andrew Bailey, the FSA's top banking regulator and Tracey McDermott, the acting head of enforcement (and responsible for the Barclays fine) are now being grilled by MPs. 5.40pm: Bailey says at the time of the February board meeting there were a whole series of issues with Barclays, but there was no impression that Bob Diamond was personally involved. 5.41pm: \"There was a culture of gaming, and gaming us,\" says Bailey. \"It had to change.\" Asked whether \"the regulator had had enough?\" Bailey replies: \"Yes.\" 5.43pm: You can read the letters between Barclays chairman Marcus Agius and the Financial Services Authority here. 5.45pm: Bailey says Diamond \"did not capture the severity of the issue\" in his answers to MPs at at an earlier committee hearing. 5.46pm: The minutes from the Barclays board meeting on 9 February say resolving the perception of an aggressive culture is \"critical to the future of the group\". 5.53pm: Bailey says he never had a conversation with a bank like the one he had with Barclays. \"Barclays was an outlier.\" You couldn't escape the fact that the culture of this institution was coming from the top. 6.02pm: Steve Hawkes, business editor of the Sun, has just tweeted this: TSC have called Andrew Bailey Anrew on his name plate ... that can't be blamed on Barclays \u2014 steve hawkes (@steve_hawkes) July 16, 2012 6.05pm: Tracey McDermott, the FSA's acting head of enforcement, says it was widely known in 2007 and 2008 that the libor market was not operating in the way it had previously done. 6.09pm: Turner is asked: \"Is this the tip of the iceberg?\" [in relation to market abuse] \"We don't know... but I would be amazed if this was everything,\" he replies. 6.14pm: Turner describes Libor to the \"frog in the boiling water story\". \"We did have, we never used the word, a somewhat light touch to regulation, in particular in those areas of wholesale conduct,\" he admits. The FSA only had five people on Barclays and five on RBS, and at one stage only had one person shared between Barclays and RBS. The focus was only to a \"small extent\" on investment banks. 6.49pm: David Ruffley is pressing on why the FSA has not undertaken any criminal investigations. \"We do not take the lead in prosecuting general fraud events,\" reiterates McDermott. Turner said earlier that the FSA has been in contact with the Serious Fraud Office throughout the Libor investigation. 6.52pm: McDermott says the FSA has used its criminal prosecution powers in insider dealing cases, but doesn't have such powers in the Libor rigging case. The City watchdog has been sharing evidence with the SFO throughout, she adds. Here we didn't believe we had the powers. 7.00pm: Faisal Islam, economics editor Channel 4 News, tweets: So i think if Diamond had not settled the Libor case: he would still be chief exec. As FSA wouldve done nothing re its litany of complaints \u2014 Faisal Islam (@faisalislam) July 16, 2012 7.07pm: Asked about governance at Barclays, Turner says: \"The form may look as it is recommended by the book, but whatever the form was, the substance wasn't working.\" McDermott says the FSA is investigating seven financial institutions over Libor, not all British banks. 7.14pm: George Mudie asks why did the FSA not act sooner on the warnings it had received, given that $4-5 trillion worth of business was affected and the reputation of the City of London was at stake. 7.20pm: \"We have been pushing this as fast as we can,\" says Turner. \"I think this is a huge problem.\" He denies shrugging his shoulder dismissively during the testimony. \"We should have spotted this earlier.

A measure of how the Irish property bubble burst can be seen in terms of the cost to the taxpayer. The International Monetary Fund estimated that in 2011 the budgetary cost of paying for the collapse \u2013 in terms of bailing out debt-ridden banks, for instance \u2013 amounted to 40 per cent of gross domestic income; by comparison, in the US, the comparable figure was 3%.</p>",

You've got value in this country right now, and you certainly have in the UK. In between sips of coffee on an unseasonably sunny Irish summer's day, Cullen concludes by saying something few observers of the Republic's mixed fortunes expected to hear again. \"I love the property business because there are very few assets that you can buy that you can honestly put your hand on your heart and say 'It doesn't matter, it will always be worth something.' Unlike stocks and shares, it will never go to zero.\" His upbeat message sounds positively Gramscian and brings to mind the Italian Marxist's most famous quote about the necessity to have \"optimism of the will, pessimism of the intellect\". Cullen sides with the former and deploys a culinary metaphor to justify his faith in a recovery. \"If you go out and you over-indulge on a particular meal and you feel ill afterwards, it doesn't mean you won't ever eat again; it just means the next time you eat out you are not going to gorge. \" The cost of the Celtic Tiger boom House prices in Ireland fell by 43 per cent in four years from 2007. In that boom year, up to 90,000 new homes were built compared to 180,000 in the UK \u2014 even though Britain's population is 13 times higher than Ireland's. A measure of how the Irish property bubble burst can be seen in terms of the cost to the taxpayer. The International Monetary Fund estimated that in 2011 the budgetary cost of paying for the collapse \u2013 in terms of bailing out debt-ridden banks, for instance \u2013 amounted to 40 per cent of gross domestic income; by comparison, in the US, the comparable figure was 3%.",

      "bodyText": "Falkland Islands explorer Borders &amp; Southern has been forced to abandon its biggest prospect off the south coast of the islands because it could not drill deep enough, sending shares plunging 70%. It is the latest setback to hit exploration firms off the coast of the disputed islands and, with further failures, could ease pressure on British and Argentinian politicians who have continued to argue over its sovereignty. The failure of Borders &amp; Southern's Stebbing well means that rival Rockhopper is still the only company to have found viable amounts of oil in the region. Borders &amp; Southern revealed it had found good quality gas but could not drill deep enough without risking a collapse of the well due to high pressure. It said: \"It is very disappointing not to have reached all the potential reservoir targets in this well.\" Shares closed down 44.3p at 18.3p, as the four other London-listed firms \u2013 Rockhopper, Desire Petroleum, Argos Resources and Falkland Oil and Gas \u2013 also fell. The drop comes despite Premier Oil entering the area by revealing it plans to spend $1bn (\u00a3646m) to help Rockhopper with its Sea Lion prospect. The well is expected to yield 320m barrels of oil. Premier last week paid the company $231m upfront for a 60% stake and will take over the drilling of the well, which it hopes to start in 2016. But Rockhopper has proved the exception in the area that has been big on words but small on delivery. The most notorious announcement from the region took place in 2010 when Desire said it had hit oil, only to change its mind 48 hours later and reveal it had only found water. Shares dropped 50% and never fully recovered. Analyst Dougie Youngson at Seymour Pierce explained that more money was needed for further discoveries in exploration that is at an early stage. He said: \"It really has been a case of mixed fortunes depending where you look. Rockhopper and Desire have had success in the north, and with Premier coming on board prospects are looking positive. \"But in the south of the island \u2026 things are at a much earlier stage with only one discovery so far.\" Falkland Oil and Gas will report from its southern prospects later this year and both the City and politicians will be watching its announcement closely. Political tensions have heated up in the past year over the islands' sovereignty \u2013 especially around the 30-year anniversary of the war between Britain and Argentina. Last month at a G20 summit David Cameron clashed with Argentine president Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez de Kirchner when she tried to hand him papers detailing her country's claim to the island. However, all five companies have continually refused to be drawn on the political problems facing the area. Meanwhile, Shell has walked away from its bid to buy London-listed oil and gas explorer Cove Energy, leaving Thailand's state-owned oil company PTT the only bidder. The ongoing battle for Cove, which has a stake in a Mozambique gas field considered one of the biggest in the world, started in February and has seen a fierce bidding war between the two. But in a statement, Shell said: \"Shell Bidco has decided not to revise its offer of 220p in cash for each share of Cove, and not take part in the auction procedure for Cove.\" Thai firm PTT Exploration and Production now have a clear run, after it offered 240p a share, or \u00a31.22bn, 48 hours after Shell's final offer of \u00a31.12bn in May was recommended by the board and six hours before the deadline for offers. As a result, Cove closed down 37.5p, 13.6%, at 273p. It had been trading higher because many shareholders thought a bigger bid was due. The Thai firm is keen to get a foothold into the booming gas exploration market in east Africa but the deal must first be confirmed by Mozambique's government, which owns a 15% stake in the Rovuma basin. It is thought about 70% of Cove shares are held by risk-arbitrage hedge funds, whose strategy is to squeeze every penny out of a potential takeover.",

      "bodyText": "The home secretary, Theresa May, has disclosed to MPs that the private security firm G4S \"repeatedly assured\" ministers that they would \"overshoot\" their Olympic security staffing. But answering an urgent Commons question on the Olympics security debacle, May firmly rejected Labour claims that the private security company had \"deliberately deceived\" the government over its failure to provide sufficient guards. May confirmed to MPs that G4S has promised to meet all the extra police and military costs including the bill for sending officers to cover for G4S staff failing to turn up for work. May was pressed by the shadow home secretary, Yvette Cooper, to make clear whether more troops beyond the 3,500 already on emergency call-up would be needed to make up the final deficit in G4S security guards at the Olympic venues. She also strongly denied weekend press reports that ministers knew long before last Wednesday that there would be not be enough private security staff to guard the 100 Olympic venues around Britain. MPs repeatedly raised with her reports that the London mayor, Boris Johnson, and his policing deputy, Stephen Greenhalgh, had said that everybody involved had known about the problem \"ages ago\". She said of reports that G4S had warned the crime and security minister, James Brokenshire, at repeated meetings: \"In fact, G4S repeatedly assured us that they would overshoot their targets,\" she said. May also rejected claims that ministers must have known about the shortfall because troops had been put on standby in April. \"This is also not the case \u2013 7,500 troops have been part of the security plan since December. \"A further 1,000 were on standby in the event of flooding or other such civil emergencies and we placed a further 2,000 on standby as a precaution in case the threat level increased. \"The 3,500 troops whose deployment I announced last Thursday are a direct response to the failure of G4S to meet its contractual obligations. A further contingency will remain.\" The home secretary said the \"precise balance of numbers\" would not become clear for the next few days. They had 20,000 accredited security guards but the problems lay in their allocation and \"scheduling\" to different venues and different tasks. Senior Labour figures, including the former cabinet ministers Jack Straw and Bob Ainsworth, said the scale of the failure in G4S provision must have been obvious to any inquiring minister or police watchdog: \"Are you saying G4S are guilty of wilful deception \u2026 or was there some failure in the monitoring of what G4S was doing?\" said Straw. May rejected the claim: \"What you fail to appreciate, it was at the stage fairly close to the Olympic Games, G4S started scheduling staff to particular venue security duties. \"It was when they started doing that that they discovered they had a problem in relation to the numbers.\" After the Commons exchanges, Cooper said: \"It is incomprehensible that with 11 days to go the home secretary still doesn't know how many staff G4S are likely to provide. Everyone wants the Olympics to be an outstanding success, and we all want the G4S shambles sorted out swiftly now.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Household energy bills will rise by \u00a315 by the start of the next decade under plans unveiled by the industry regulator for upgrading gas and electricity networks. Ofgem said the \u00a322bn programme will see household bills rise by \u00a37 next year and up to \u00a315 by 2021. Distribution costs account for around 20% of a household gas bill, with any large-scale investment programme therefore having a material impact. The average household dual fuel bill is \u00a31,310 according to Ofgem. However, the proposals were slammed by Britain's dominant energy network business, National Grid. In a statement the company said its own plan \"differs substantially\" from Ofgem's, which argues that National Grid can deliver the improvements at a lower cost. Lord Mogg, Ofgem's chairman, said the multibillion pound programme was needed to overhaul existing infrastructure and meet environmental targets, which includes attaching a new generation of offshore wind farms to the energy grid and installing hundreds of kilometres of new power lines above and below the ground. \"Britain faces an unprecedented need to invest to replace ageing infrastructure, meet environmental targets and deliver secure supplies. This needs to be carried out at a time of global financial uncertainty, which makes attracting investment difficult but possible,\" he said. The \u00a322bn programme comprises a \u00a315bn investment in the upgrade and renewal of the high voltage electricity network in England and Wales, including attaching new power plants to the grid, as well as improving high pressure gas networks in the UK, which transfer gas from offshore gasfields to the main network. The investment in both networks \u2013 owned by National Grid \u2013 includes replacing 1,500km of overhead power line and installing 350km of new overhead lines, with a further 264km underground. The remaining \u00a37bn is for the low pressure gas network \u2013 half of which is controlled by National Grid \u2013 which supplies homes and businesses across the UK including all British Gas customers. The plans include connecting 80,000 poor households who are not on the gas grid currently, with Ofgem estimating that the upgrade programme will generate 7,000 jobs. Ofgem expects to produce final proposals in December. National Grid criticised the proposals, which fall short of its own estimates for the amount of money that needs to be spent over the remainder of the decade. It wanted to spend more than \u00a330bn on gas pipelines and on electricity transmission over the period. Instead, Ofgem has said National Grid and other gas distribution companies can spend up to \u00a322bn in total. . As National Grid shares fell 2% to 678p, the company issued a rebuke of Ofgem's proposals. \"We believe that these initial proposals will not appropriately incentivise the essential investments necessary to provide safe, reliable networks for the UK consumer and avoid delays to the achievement of the UK's environmental targets,\" the company said. \"The financing packages proposed do not, on either a standalone basis or in comparison with other regulatory outcomes, adequately reflect the increased scale of investment and implicit risk associated with the major investment required in the coming years to build the energy system that our customers will need in the future, whether in transmission or distribution infrastructure.\"",

      "bodyText": "The battle between the City and Westminster heats up today as Barclays, National Grid and G4S continue to be hauled over the coals by MPs and regulators, and the markets are starting to take notice, with all three companies' shareprice dropping. But first, the indexes across Europe were having a quiet morning, opening flat across the board. All the major European markets have opened steady, cautiously waiting to see what the week has to bring. FTSE 100 is down 5 points at 5661, French CAC down 2 points at 3179, German DAX down 5 points 6562, Spanish IBEX down 13 points at 6652, and Italian FTSE MIB up 21 points at 13736. On the bonds markets Spain's 10 year bond yield is up 7 bps at 6.73% and Italy's 10 year bond yield is flat at 6.06%. Over at Westminster the Libor scandal continues its murky journey through the corridors of power as the treasury select committee lines up its latest city figures for a grilling. Today, Barclays former chief operating officer, Jerry del Misser is up. You may remember he is the one who \"misunderstood\" Bank of England instructions about manipulating the Libor rates. Later on, FSA chairman Adiar Turner will appear, followed by Tracey McDermott, the regulator's head of enforcement and financial crime. In preparation, the market has given its feelings on the matter, sending Barclays shares down 4.5p, 2.8%, to 157.6p \u2013 a 2012 low, making it the second biggest faller on the leading index. The biggest faller, unsurprisingly, is G4S as the Olympics security fiasco continues to unravel. Analysts at RBS, UBS, Jefferies and Seymour Pierce have all cut their ratings. Shares were down nearly 10% in early trading but recovered slightly, down 18.2p, 6.5%, at 260.5p. Chief executive Nick Buckles will face tough questioning over the next two days \u2013 meeting with shareholders on Monday and sitting before the home office select committee on Tuesday \u2013 to explain why more than 3,000 troops will be deployed to fill in the gaps at the Olympics park left by G4S not getting enough staff signed up. He was not helped over the weekend when Chairman John Connolly refused to give his full support to the boss. He told the Financial Times: \"We don't want to do anything that smacks of short-term expediency, but it would be right to consider whether any members of the senior team are best placed to take the company forward. \"Any decision we make as a board will be in the clear interests of the entire company.\" Analysts are now piling in. Kevin Lapwood at Seymour Pierce wrote: Over the weekend the CEO (now almost certainly the soon to be ex-CEO) of G4S admitted that its failure to deliver the required number of guards for the Olympic Games and the need to bring in the military, will result in G4S incurring a loss of \u00a335m-\u00a350m on the \u00a3320m contract. What next? It appears certain that CEO Nick Buckles, who is due to appear before MPs on Tuesday, will fall on the sword along with other senior UK management. This could lead to a period of instability at the company which appointed a new Chairman just over a month ago. Whoever is in charge will have a lot of work to do to repair the company's reputation, especially at home in the UK and with the UK government, its single largest customer. This will be crucial for the company's future. The UK accounts for just under 20% of group revenues (\u00a31.2bn) with more than half coming from the UK government. UK profits are 27% of group total at \u00a3119m, with the government accounting for over \u00a370m. There will be some short term repercussions but overall we believe G4S has a good track record with the UK government. The shortcomings on the LOCOG contract should not significantly affect its chances of benefiting from government outsourcing in the longer term. In addition, we remain confident that the operational and geographic diversity of G4S will enable the company to continue to outperform in the medium term. National Grid is also having a tough time today, down 13.5p, 2%, at 679.5p, as it starts its battle with Ofgem. The energy regulator has said it will provide up to \u00a322bn to upgrade the infrastructure and will lay out its plans more fully later this month. In return for the cash, National Grid will have to abide by stricter rules set by Ofgem, something it is not too keen on. In a statement, the company said: \"We believe that these initial proposals will not appropriately incentivise the essential investments necessary to provide safe, reliable networks for the UK consumer and avoid delays to the achievement of the UK's environmental targets.\" In other words \u2013 we need more money. Previously the company has said it will cost around \u00a331bn to upgrade the UK's electricity supply. Meanwhile at the other end, energineering firm, Smiths Group was one of the biggest risers, up 17p, 1.6%, at \u00a310.54 thanks to the sale of its stake in Cross Match Technologies for $77m, as it continues to sell off its non-core assets.",
