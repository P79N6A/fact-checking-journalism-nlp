      "bodyText": "With its intimidating Washington headquarters and teams of crack young policy wonks jetting into troubled countries to read the riot act, the International Monetary Fund has a reputation as a bastion of economic orthodoxy. But Christine Lagarde's intervention last week at the fund's annual meetings in Tokyo, where she warned the world's finance ministers against slashing public budgets too far, too fast, showed that in the topsy-turvy world of economics after the crunch, the most conservative institutions have sometimes been in the vanguard of the intellectual revolution. In the midst of the deepest and longest-lasting economic malaise since the Great Depression, you might expect practitioners of economics to be wracked with self-doubt, academic departments from California to Cambridge sweeping away the old thinking that gave intellectual heft to the claims of City investment firms to be spreading risk and making the financial world a safer place. But as the Nobel committee prepares to announce this year's winner of the economic sciences laureate tomorrow, David Blanchflower, the US economist and former member of the Bank of England's monetary policy committee, says most people in the profession have sailed on unperturbed: \"Economics proceeds as if nothing has happened since 2008. Everybody's going on doing exactly the same things they always did, teaching the same classes.\" As for the forecasting record of many of the world's most eminent economic institutions, not least the Bank of England, he says, \"In many ways, we would have been better off to hire a monkey to throw darts at a dartboard.\" The Bank, as well as the independent office for budget responsibility established by George Osborne, and the vast majority of thinktanks and City forecasters, failed to anticipate the severity of the Great Recession, and the painstaking nature of the recovery. Yet many economists persist in clinging to their cherished mathematical constructions of the world, simply postponing the upturn each quarter when confronted with the reality that it has failed to materialise. And few have conceded that some of the fundamental tenets of their work \u2013 that individuals are perfectly rational, or markets always clear at the right price \u2013 need to be junked. There are islands of resistance. Two former winners of the economics Nobel, Paul Krugman and Joseph Stiglitz, have used their prominence as public intellectuals over the past five years to issue repeated rebukes to policymakers for failing to grasp the scale of the crisis, and take sufficiently radical action to protect the economy from the worst ravages of the downturn. Maverick thinkers such as Nassim Nicholas Taleb, the author of Black Swan, whose latest book, Antifragile, on the fragility of systems, was cited by Sir Mervyn King in a speech last week, have sought to popularise the fact that model-based, mathematised economics is based on fundamental misunderstandings of the world. But Krugman and Stiglitz were already well-established as radicals, with strong sympathies for the Keynesian analysis that premature public spending cuts would inflict untold damage. The IMF's shift, from cheerleading for austerity to advocating a gentler approach, shows just how much old orthodoxies are crumbling in the face of the facts. Five years after the onset of the crisis, the eurozone is on the brink of collapse and the UK is mired in a double-dip recession, despite embracing drastic deficit cuts. Eric Beinhocker is the executive director of Oxford's Institute for New Economic Thinking, part of a transatlantic effort to rethink the basic tenets taught to students over recent decades. He says: \"The crisis has revealed enormous gaps in economists' understanding of the linkages between the financial system and the broader economy. Before the crisis, few economists would have predicted that trouble in an obscure corner of the US mortgage market could cascade into a global calamity.\" He argues that there is lots of work going on to address these shortcomings, but \"some advocate tweaking existing models, while others feel a more radical rethink is needed\". Jonathan Portes, director of the National Institute for Economic and Social Research, falls into the latter camp. He's a fierce critic of the government's deficit-cutting strategy. But he says that in microeconomics \u2013 the bottom-up study of individual firms and markets \u2013 it would be wrong to throw the baby out with the bathwater. \"I don't think the crisis tells us much about the fundamental underpinnings of microeconomics,\" he says. However, he believes where economists failed was in assuming that finance worked just like any other market: \"When it came to financial companies, it turned out we needed to think about them completely differently. More markets are not necessarily better.\" He adds that one lesson economists may need to learn is to be more humble about the predictive power of their economic models, however neat and precise the mathematics that underlies them. Complex mathematical equations have replaced what Blanchflower calls \"the economics of walking about,\" as the foundation of the modern subject. Lord Skidelsky, economic historian and biographer of Keynes, agrees: \"It may be that there's no perfect model, and that the quest for one is an error. Maybe we need different models, different theories, for different situations, and that's the best we can do. Keynes said economics was a moral science, not a natural science \u2013 by which I mean that it has to take into account the variability of human situations.\" In other words, economics is not physics, because people are by their nature unpredictable. No one is going to discover an economic \"God particle\" that explains why someone decides to sell their house, hire an extra worker or buy a new car. \"There's no new paradigm; and perhaps the search for one is a bit misguided.\" As for tomorrow's Nobel prize, Skidelsky says it may tell us more about passing intellectual fads than fundamental truths about the economic world. \"My general feeling is that Nobel prizes in economics very closely follow current fashions in the discipline.\"",

    "webTitle": "John Lewis thinks small to beat recession with compact stores in well-heeled towns", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "\"That is a good omen,\" says John Lewis boss Andy Street, pointing to the small rainbow breaking through the grey drizzle obscuring the majesty of Exeter cathedral's imposing Norman towers. The 100 shoppers queuing around the block to get into the shop are also a good sign for middle Britain's favourite department store, which has just opened in the well-heeled university city. With crowds more common at closing down sales these days, the bustle is a refreshing sight. Local businesses anticipate a \"John Lewis effect\" that will draw shoppers from across the county. \"This will attract more business to Exeter,\" says Pete Emmanuel, a trader who runs one of the adjacent market stalls. Emmanuel is surprisingly upbeat given the competitive threat posed by a retailer which measures its turnover in billions. \"We have our own clientele and sell things other people don't,\" he says; his stall currently has a monopoly on medical support stockings. The compact five-storey John Lewis, at what one person described as the \"grotty\" end of the high street, is a departure from the company's usual sprawling interiors. Like other major chains before the recession, John Lewis relied on new malls and regeneration projects to provide new outlets. But with property investors taking a dim view of our future spending power, many schemes have been mothballed or dropped. At half the usual size, the \"flexible\" format means opening in smaller shopping centres makes financial sense. \"We can now consider opening shops in areas that were not always thought feasible for a traditional John Lewis building,\" says Street. He sees \"at least 10\" locations, including York and Chelmsford, where such stores could work. Despite the rearguard action being fought by government high street tsar Mary Portas, town centres around the country are being pushed to breaking point as retail chains are felled by the recession. One in seven high-street shops lies empty, with the recent failure of JJB Sports, which resulted in more than 130 closures, making a grim picture worse. Against that backdrop, the strength of Exeter's retail centre \u2013 albeit with more chain stores than the national average \u2013 is a good example of what can be achieved when councils and developers work together. Local news reports hailed the arrival of John Lewis as one of the most significant events in the city's economic history. Property giant Land Securities was behind the \u00a3225m redevelopment of Exeter's Princesshay shopping precinct as well as the multimillion-pound refurbishment of the building John Lewis now occupies. \"It's about appropriate scale,\" says its development director Nick Davis. \"We didn't flood Exeter with 100 new shops. The city already has a low level of retail voids and the arrival of John Lewis will widen the catchment and strengthen Exeter not only as a place to shop but also to invest.\" John Lewis is defying the economic trend with sales up 12% in the year to date. Analysts are divided on whether the banking crisis has turned Britons on to the charms of the retailer's employee-ownership scheme or if it has thrived because its customers tend to come from higher socio-economic brackets. There are rails devoted to outdoor brands Barbour and Hunter, as well as items from local designer Alice Temperley, while shelving racks of designer coffee machines and towels are straight out of the pages of a lifestyle magazine. But with UK retail sales growth expected to be minimal this year, Exeter's gain could be at the expense of nearby centres such as Exmouth and Newton Abbot, says Matthew Hopkinson of retail research firm Local Data Company: \"It's like a ship listing sending the tin rolling from one side to the other.\" The success of the large indoor shopping complex, such as Manchester's Trafford Centre or the Westfield malls in London, suggests consumers want big modern stores even if they bemoan the disappearance of their high street. Retailers now need just 120 stores to cover the UK compared with 500 in the 80s and 90s. Despite being a national chain John Lewis has just 38 stores, supplemented by a huge online operation. Hopkinson says the task of shoring up Britain's high streets against structural change brings to mind the business maxim \"how do you eat an elephant?\". \"The answer is you cut it into small pieces first. What we're dealing with is people having to eat an elephant; they have to manage decline to a point they can regenerate from.\"",

    "webTitle": "Rise of lapdancing clubs is checked as Spearmint Rhino runs up a loss of \u00a32m", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "It has become a bellwether for the City, its fortunes closely mirroring those of the Square Mile's high rollers. So perhaps unsurprisingly, given the current economic turbulence, Britain's most famous chain of lapdancing clubs appears to have been experiencing a bumpy ride of its own. In the week that it applied to run the country's first 24-hour lapdancing club, in London's Tottenham Court Road, Spearmint Rhino has filed accounts showing that it ran up a loss of \u00a32.1m in 2011. The figure \u2013 some \u00a31.4m more than the loss from the previous year \u2013 was despite the company's clubs pulling in an impressive \u00a39.9m in revenue, up from \u00a38.5m the previous year. But the chain's critics are unlikely to shed too many tears. \"Any profit that lapdancing clubs like Spearmint Rhino make is off the back of exploiting women. It is time that councils use their licensing powers effectively to clamp down on these sexist sex establishments,\" said Anna van Heeswijk, acting chief executive of Object, the campaign group that opposes lapdancing clubs. Operating profits at the chain fell to \u00a3429,000, down from more than \u00a3500,000, but rising administration costs and ill-fated business ventures drove the company's figures deeper into the red. The small print reveals that the company, which paid \u00a33.5m in wages to its 162 employees in 2011, was forced to write off a \u00a32.8m loan to a related company. It also shows that the company's founder and director, John Gray, believed to have been paid a salary of \u00a3304,000, resigned in April and that no dividend was paid. And there are further financial demands on the company to be resolved. The accounts reveal that the company owes HM Revenue and Customs more than \u00a32m, which it has agreed to repay under a \"time to pay\" agreement. In addition, the accounts confirm that the chain owes Spearmint Rhino Worldwide Inc, the company that owns 12 clubs in the US, almost \u00a33m. An HMRC spokeswoman said that it could not discuss the tax affairs of an individual business. She explained: \"A time to pay arrangement is given on a case by case basis. The amount of tax and revised payment schedule can vary dependent on how much is owed and over what period of time. Interest is still payable on tax paid late, even if through a time to pay arrangement.\" Spearmint Rhino's battles with the Revenue go back years. In 2007, it successfully appealed against a ruling that it had to pay VAT on the earnings of its dancers. David Milne QC, representing Spearmint Rhino, argued that the club should not pay because it was \"the dancer and not the club that provided the services\". The ruling meant that the chain's lapdancers were potentially liable for VAT. Spearmint Rhino has been at the forefront of the UK's lapdancing revolution, which has seen the number of clubs soar to 300 \u2013 a 50% increase compared with 10 years ago. The Lapdancing Association claims that 25,000 people in the UK now work in an industry that generates \u00a32bn a year. But the rise in the number of clubs now appears to have been checked. A law change in 2009 meant that the clubs were classed as a \"sex encounter venue\" and subject to more stringent licensing conditions. Many cities have now stopped granting licences to new clubs while others, notably Oxford, has declined to renew them. Spearmint Rhino, whose Birmingham club is reputedly the largest lapdancing venue in the UK, has itself retrenched. It now runs only five clubs, compared with nine in 2008. However, its management has said it has plans to expand and to take on 60 new dancers. Requests for comment from the company were not returned.",

So perhaps unsurprisingly, given the current economic turbulence, Britain's most famous chain of lapdancing clubs appears to have been experiencing a bumpy ride of its own.</p> <p>In the week that it applied to run the country's first 24-hour lapdancing club, in London's Tottenham Court Road, Spearmint Rhino has filed accounts showing that it ran up a loss of \u00a32.1m in 2011.</p> <p>The figure \u2013 some \u00a31.4m more than the loss from the previous year \u2013 was despite the company's clubs pulling in an impressive \u00a39.9m in revenue, up from \u00a38.5m the previous year.</p> <p>But the chain's critics are unlikely to shed too many tears. \"Any profit that lapdancing clubs like Spearmint Rhino make is off the back of exploiting women. It is time that councils use their licensing powers effectively to clamp down on these sexist sex establishments,\" said Anna van Heeswijk, acting chief executive of Object, the campaign group that opposes lapdancing clubs.</p> <p>Operating profits at the chain fell to \u00a3429,000, down from more than \u00a3500,000, but rising administration costs and ill-fated business ventures drove the company's figures deeper into the red.</p> <p>The small print reveals that the company, which paid \u00a33.5m in wages to its 162 employees in 2011, was forced to write off a \u00a32.8m loan to a related company. It also shows that the company's founder and director, John Gray, believed to have been paid a salary of \u00a3304,000, resigned in April and that no dividend was paid.</p> <p>And there are further financial demands on the company to be resolved. The accounts reveal that the company owes HM Revenue and Customs more than \u00a32m, which it has agreed to repay under a \"time to pay\" agreement.</p> <p>In addition, the accounts confirm that the chain owes Spearmint Rhino Worldwide Inc, the company that owns 12 clubs in the US, almost \u00a33m.</p> <p>An HMRC spokeswoman said that it could not discuss the tax affairs of an individual business. She explained: \"A time to pay arrangement is given on a case by case basis. The amount of tax and revised payment schedule can vary dependent on how much is owed and over what period of time. Interest is still payable on tax paid late, even if through a time to pay arrangement.\"</p> <p>Spearmint Rhino's battles with the Revenue go back years. In 2007, it successfully appealed against a ruling that it had to pay VAT on the earnings of its dancers. David Milne QC, representing Spearmint Rhino, argued that the club should not pay because it was \"the dancer and not the club that provided the services\". The ruling meant that the chain's lapdancers were potentially liable for VAT.</p> <p>Spearmint Rhino has been at the forefront of the UK's lapdancing revolution, which has seen the number of clubs soar to 300 \u2013 a 50% increase compared with 10 years ago. The Lapdancing Association claims that 25,000 people in the UK now work in an industry that generates \u00a32bn a year.</p> <p>But the rise in the number of clubs now appears to have been checked. A law change in 2009 meant that the clubs were classed as a \"sex encounter venue\" and subject to more stringent licensing conditions.</p> <p>Many cities have now stopped granting licences to new clubs while others, notably Oxford, has declined to renew them.</p> <p>Spearmint Rhino, whose Birmingham club is reputedly the largest lapdancing venue in the UK, has itself retrenched. It now runs only five clubs, compared with nine in 2008. However, its management has said it has plans to expand and to take on 60 new dancers.</p> <p>Requests for comment from the company were not returned.</p>",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "'Earlier on today, apparently, a woman rang the BBC and said she'd heard there was a hurricane on the way. Well, if you're watching, don't worry, there isn't.\" So said BBC weatherman Michael Fish on 15 October 1987. On the morning of Friday 16 October that year, anybody surveying the Kent estate of Bank of England governor Robin Leigh-Pemberton would have been shocked at how it had been stripped of its finest trees. A freak overnight hurricane had wrecked his grounds, just as it had those of the property owned by the governor's neighbour, City fund manager Richard Oldfield. Meanwhile, bankers living closer to the City were stepping over felled trees in leafy Chelsea on their way to the office. Those who arrived in the Square Mile found little to do: the money markets had been closed. The scene was a shocking one for a country not used to serious natural disasters. But if anybody in the City was cursing the predictive powers of Fish, they soon had cause to wonder whether the financial world's own crystal ball had also malfunctioned. By Monday morning it was clear the Great Storm of 1987 was being followed by a great financial crash. That day was 25 years ago this week. Black Monday, as it came to be known, began in Hong Kong and quickly spread west to Europe, before hitting Wall Street, where the Dow Jones slumped by an unprecedented 23% to take the index 34% below its level earlier that October. In London the FTSE fell by 11% on the Monday, a further 12% on the Tuesday and another 6% on the Thursday; those who worked through the slide reported how the shock of share price slumps caused some traders to become paralysed, staring blankly at their screens, with \"sweat running down their faces\". It was not just the traders, either. Lord (Nigel) Lawson, then chancellor of the exchequer, recalls: \"My reading of it at the time was that the Wall Street collapse and collapse of other stock markets around the world had rattled the Bank of England and they were in a bit of a state of panic. My judgment at the time was that they weren't thinking straight as they were panicked by what was going on in the financial markets.\" Like any bull or bear runs, the mood was contagious, which almost certainly exacerbated the market's moves. Oldfield, who was then the head of Mercury Asset Management's US equity team, recalls: \"We had returned early from a holiday to deal with the fallen trees when somebody called me at home to tell me that the Dow had fallen by 500 points. Looking at the awful carnage outside I can remember thinking how [the trees were] so much more important and how [the Wall Street crash] was an unjustified fall. I felt strongly that it was a good time to buy shares \u2026 I then went into the office, which was a mistake. I was overwhelmed by the sense of panic.\" Within a few hours Oldfield had been infected by the hysteria and changed his judgment from buy to sell, \"the worst mistake of my career,\" he says. History now tells us that shares swiftly recovered: two years later London's blue-chip index was trading again at 1987 highs, and subsequently soared away during the 1990s. Unlike now there was no banking crisis to transmit the problems to the real economy. In fact, Black Monday was merely the pricking of a stock market bubble \u2013 a financial market crisis for sure, but not an economic one. However, making such predictions in October 1987 would have seemed fanciful. The talk of the time involved comparisons with the crash of 1929 and the subsequent depression, while central banks reacted to those concerns by colluding to cut interest rates. On 20 October Alan Greenspan, then just two months into his role as chairman of the US Federal Reserve, started in his new job as he meant to go on, stating: \"The Federal Reserve, consistent with its responsibilities as the nation's central bank, affirmed today its readiness to serve as a source of liquidity to support the economic and financial system.\" That support for Wall Street was to become the defining theme of his tenure, known by investors as \"the Greenspan put\". Such unquestioning support of the markets is now considered to be a folly. Lawson says: \"Greenspan is a nice man, an amusing man and an interesting man, I used to know him very well and he is highly intelligent, but he got it all wrong \u2013 completely wrong.\" Many now believe that the way in which the 1987 crash was dealt with by central bankers \u2013 mirrored in subsequent crises in the 1990s and early 2000s \u2013 signalled the start of the creation of moral hazard, where bankers began believing that no matter how expensive their miscalculations, they would always be saved. Stock market historian David Schwartz says: \"The central bankers, whether they admitted it or not, were taking it on themselves to keep the markets afloat. That caused two things. Investors believed they would be rescued if things went bad, which boosted share prices. And the stimuli had knock-on effects, so the stimulus provided in the late 1990s [during the Asian and LTCM crises] is viewed by many now as the reason the tech bubble bubbled up so much. Each time a stimulus is provided there is an ill effect that nobody is looking at elsewhere.\" For his part Lawson, who in 1987 controlled UK base rates, made three separate half-point cuts before the end of 1987 \u2013 and while some economists have questioned whether those moves contributed to the unsustainable \"Lawson Boom\", others viewed his actions as restraint. On 5 November, the day after the second cut, shadow chancellor John Smith moved a motion in the House of Commons urging \"the government to ... significantly cut interest rates\". With hindsight, it may seem the events of Black Monday should have provided a warning of the chaos a newly confident City could unleash. But predictably the former chancellor argues that the current crisis has nothing to do with policy decisions taken 25 years ago. \"You really can't trace it back [to 1987],' says Lawson. \"You can maybe see some of the signs of the way that American investment banks operated. You can see this as a harbinger of much worse behaviour and much bigger problems 20 years later. But I don't think you can somehow say that there was something that happened in 1987 that caused the financial crisis.\" The bad behaviour that Lawson refers to is not a general statement \u2013 but a specific reference to his dealings with Wall Street over one very high-profile deal. The postponement of the UK government's flotation of the water industry in July 1986 had created a hole in its privatisation timetable and in March 1987 a replacement was announced: the sale of the state's remaining 31.5% stake in BP. The oil group also wanted to raise \u00a31.5bn for its own uses, meaning the total float would be worth \u00a37.25bn, dwarfing the \u00a35bn British Gas offer the year before. But by an awful coincidence, the world's largest share sale was to coincide with the world's most dramatic stock market crash. A string of City and Wall Street banks underwrote the offer \u2013 essentially providing an insurance policy taken out by the government whereby the banks committed to buy any unsold shares at a pre-arranged price. That price was agreed on 14 October, but by Black Monday BP's existing shares were trading 14% below that level. It was then that City and Wall Street banks tried to renege on the deal. Lawson recalls: \"[Wall Street] lobbied Alan Greenspan and got him to make representations to the Bank of England that I should be stopped from going ahead. They also lobbied the American administration ... to try to get Margaret [Thatcher] to tell me to pull the issue. Margaret behaved impeccably. She not only immediately informed me of this approach behind my back but she totally supported me in the view I had taken to go ahead. It was enormous pressure they put on me. Quite extraordinary.\" The government did hold out, the banks were forced to pay up and the financiers' warnings that their losses would create a banking crisis turned out to be total nonsense. As one City veteran says: \"Most of the City, who weren't involved with underwriting the BP offer, thought 'good on the government',\" while failing to suppress a wry smile at the suggestion that here was a rare case of bankers getting stuffed by the taxpayer \u2013 rather than the other way around. Crazy as it may seem now, that was the way it once could work, albeit a quarter of a century ago.",

      "body": "<p>'Earlier on today, apparently, a woman rang the BBC and said she'd heard there was a hurricane on the way. Well, if you're watching, don't worry, there isn't.\" So said BBC weatherman Michael Fish on 15&#xa0;October 1987.</p> <p>On the morning of Friday 16 October that year, anybody surveying the Kent estate of Bank of England governor Robin Leigh-Pemberton would have been shocked at how it had been stripped of its finest trees. A freak overnight hurricane had wrecked his grounds, just as it had those of the property owned by the governor's neighbour, City fund manager Richard Oldfield.</p> <p>Meanwhile, bankers living closer to the City were stepping over felled trees in leafy Chelsea on their way to the office. Those who arrived in the Square Mile found little to do: the money markets had been closed.</p> <p>The scene was a shocking one for a country not used to serious natural disasters. But if anybody in the City was cursing the predictive powers of Fish, they soon had cause to wonder whether the financial world's own crystal ball had also malfunctioned. By Monday morning it was clear the Great Storm of 1987 was being followed by a great financial crash. That day was 25 years ago this week.</p> <p>Black Monday, as it came to be known, began in Hong Kong and quickly spread west to Europe, before hitting Wall Street, where the Dow Jones slumped by an unprecedented 23% to take the index 34% below its level earlier that October.</p> <p>In London the FTSE fell by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/table/2008/sep/19/ftse100.worst.days\" title=\"\">11% on the Monday, a further 12% on the Tuesday and another 6% on the Thursday;</a> those who worked through the slide reported how the shock of share price slumps caused some traders to become paralysed, staring blankly at their screens, with \"sweat running down their faces\".</p> <p>It was not just the traders, either. Lord (Nigel) Lawson, then chancellor of the exchequer, recalls: \"My reading of it at the time was that the Wall Street collapse and collapse of other stock markets around the world had rattled the Bank of England and they were in a bit of a state of panic. My judgment at the time was that they weren't thinking straight as they were panicked by what was going on in the financial markets.\"</p> <p>Like any bull or bear runs, the mood was contagious, which almost certainly exacerbated the market's moves. Oldfield, who was then the head of Mercury Asset Management's US equity team, recalls: \"We had returned early from a holiday to deal with the fallen trees when somebody called me at home to tell me that the Dow had fallen by 500 points. Looking at the awful carnage outside I can remember thinking how [the trees were] so much more important and how [the Wall Street crash] was an unjustified fall. I felt strongly that it was a good time to buy shares \u2026 I then went into the office, which was a mistake. I was overwhelmed by the sense of panic.\"</p> <p>Within a few hours Oldfield had been infected by the hysteria and changed his judgment from buy to sell, \"the worst mistake of my career,\" he says. History now tells us that shares swiftly recovered: two years later London's blue-chip index was <a href=\"http://www.google.co.uk/finance?chdnp=1&amp;chdd=1&amp;chds=1&amp;chdv=1&amp;chvs=maximized&amp;chdeh=0&amp;chfdeh=0&amp;chdet=1350025540524&amp;chddm=3766581&amp;chls=IntervalBasedLine&amp;q=INDEXFTSE:UKX&amp;ntsp=0&amp;ei=PsF3UMijFuSFwAOIfA\" title=\"\">trading again at 1987 highs, and subsequently soared away during the 1990s</a>. Unlike now there was no banking crisis to transmit the problems to the real economy. In fact, Black Monday was merely the pricking of a stock market bubble \u2013 a financial market crisis for sure, but not an economic one.</p> <p>However, making such predictions in October 1987 would have seemed fanciful. The talk of the time involved comparisons with the crash of 1929 and the subsequent depression, while central banks reacted to those concerns by colluding to cut interest rates. On 20 October Alan Greenspan, then just two months into his role as chairman of the US Federal Reserve, started in his new job as he meant to go on, stating: \"The Federal Reserve, consistent with its responsibilities as the nation's central bank, affirmed today its readiness to serve as a source of liquidity to support the economic and financial system.\" That support for Wall Street was to become the defining theme of his tenure, known by investors as \"the Greenspan put\".</p> <p>Such unquestioning support of the markets is now considered to be a folly. Lawson says: \"Greenspan is a nice man, an amusing man and an interesting man, I used to know him very well and he is highly intelligent, but he got it all wrong \u2013 completely wrong.\" Many now believe that the way in which the 1987 crash was dealt with by central bankers \u2013 mirrored in subsequent crises in the 1990s and early 2000s \u2013 signalled the start of the creation of moral hazard, where bankers began believing that no matter how expensive their miscalculations, they would always be saved.</p> <p>Stock market historian David Schwartz says: \"The central bankers, whether they admitted it or not, were taking it on themselves to keep the markets afloat. That caused two things. Investors believed they would be rescued if things went bad, which boosted share prices. And the stimuli had knock-on effects, so the stimulus provided in the late 1990s [during the Asian and LTCM crises] is viewed by many now as the reason the tech bubble bubbled up so much. Each time a stimulus is provided there is an ill effect that nobody is looking at elsewhere.\"</p> <p>For his part Lawson, who in 1987 controlled UK base rates, <a href=\"http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/boeapps/iadb/Repo.asp\" title=\"\">made three separate half-point cuts before the end of 1987</a> \u2013 and while some economists have questioned whether those moves contributed to the unsustainable \"Lawson Boom\", others viewed his actions as restraint. On 5 November, the day after the second cut, shadow chancellor John Smith moved a motion in the House of Commons urging \"<a href=\"http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1987/nov/05/financial-markets\" title=\"\">the government to ... significantly cut interest rates</a>\".</p> <p>With hindsight, it may seem the events of Black Monday should have provided a warning of the chaos a newly confident City could unleash. But predictably the former chancellor argues that the current crisis has nothing to do with policy decisions taken 25 years ago.</p> <p>\"You really can't trace it back [to 1987],' says Lawson. \"You can maybe see some of the signs of the way that American investment banks operated. You can see this as a harbinger of much worse behaviour and much bigger problems 20 years later. But I don't think you can somehow say that there was something that happened in 1987 that caused the financial crisis.\"</p> <p>The bad behaviour that Lawson refers to is not a general statement \u2013 but a specific reference to his dealings with Wall Street over one very high-profile deal.</p> <p>The postponement of the UK government's flotation of the water industry in July 1986 had created a hole in its privatisation timetable and in March 1987 a replacement was announced: the sale of the state's remaining 31.5% stake in BP.</p> <p>The oil group also wanted to raise \u00a31.5bn for its own uses, meaning the total float would be worth \u00a37.25bn, dwarfing the \u00a35bn British Gas offer the year before. But by an awful coincidence, the world's largest share sale was to coincide with the world's most dramatic stock market crash.</p> <p>A string of City and Wall Street banks underwrote the offer \u2013 essentially providing an insurance policy taken out by the government whereby the banks committed to buy any unsold shares at a pre-arranged price. That price was agreed on 14 October, but by Black Monday BP's existing shares were trading 14% below that level. It was then that City and Wall Street banks tried to renege on the deal.</p> <p>Lawson recalls: \"[Wall Street] lobbied Alan Greenspan and got him to make representations to the Bank of England that I should be stopped from going ahead. They also lobbied the American administration ... to try to get Margaret [Thatcher] to tell me to pull the issue. Margaret behaved impeccably. She not only immediately informed me of this approach behind my back but she totally supported me in the view I had taken to go ahead. It was enormous pressure they put on me. Quite extraordinary.\"</p> <p>The government did hold out, the banks were forced to pay up and the financiers' warnings that their losses would create a banking crisis turned out to be total nonsense.</p> <p>As one City veteran says: \"Most of the City, who weren't involved with underwriting the BP offer, thought 'good on the government',\" while failing to suppress a wry smile at the suggestion that here was a rare case of bankers getting stuffed by the taxpayer \u2013 rather than the other way around. Crazy as it may seem now, that was the way it once could work, albeit a quarter of a century ago.</p>",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "George Osborne was increasingly isolated over energy policy last night, after the head of the CBI said that too much reliance on gas as a future source of energy would leave consumers and businesses dangerously exposed to further sharp price rises on global markets. After a week in which two of Britain's biggest energy suppliers shocked customers by announcing increases of up to 9% on gas and electricity bills from next month, business leaders are warning that the chancellor's enthusiasm for a \"dash for gas\" looks like a recipe for economic and environmental disaster. In the latest blow to Osborne \u2013 before a crucial ministerial meeting to determine government energy policy this week \u2013 the director general of the CBI, John Cridland, said it was \"crucial\" to avoid too much reliance on one energy source, particularly if, as in the case of gas, much would have to be imported. Many business leaders, together with the environmental lobby, argue that investment in green energy will not only be good for the UK economy in terms of investment and job creation, but will also mean the UK has more control over its own future energy provision, rather than being reliant on imports. In a clear warning to the chancellor, who has made no secret of his support for greater use of gas and less government support for renewable energy, Cridland said: \"Gas has a big part to play in the UK's energy mix in the years to come, but we cannot become dependent on any one source of energy. Over-reliance on new gas would leave us exposed to global price and supply fluctuations and jeopardise our carbon targets, so we need to build more of everything, including renewables, nuclear and CCS [carbon capture and storage].\" Last Monday, seven global electricity and nuclear technology companies, including Siemens and Mitsubishi Power Systems, threatened to withdraw hundreds of millions of pounds of investment in new energy projects in Britain because of uncertainties of about the government's commitment to green, low-carbon policies. The withdrawal of so much investment would mean the loss of thousands of jobs. The firms said the lack of certainty and absence of decisions \"have caused us to reassess the level of political risk in the UK\". This Thursday, the so-called Quad of senior ministers, which includes David Cameron, Osborne, Nick Clegg and Danny Alexander, Lib Dem chief secretary to the Treasury, will meet to decide on the content of the energy bill, which aims to set the framework for a future of affordable, clean energy in the UK. Sources say Osborne may push for cuts to offshore wind subsidies from government and for reductions in support for carbon capture and storage projects from four to two or even one, in return for agreeing a flexible decarbonisation target for the industry. Joss Garman, the political director of Greenpeace, called on Clegg to stand up for the green agenda at the meeting: \"When rocketing gas prices have already driven up bills for millions of families, and when both business and consumer groups are warning that gas is likely to get even more expensive, it would be idiotic for ministers to give the green light to a big increase in our reliance on pricey imports of this polluting fuel. The Liberal Democrats should insist on stabilising consumer bills with clean, home-grown renewables instead.\" Writing in today's Observer, Lord Stern, author of the 2006 Stern review on the economics of climate change, said that, while subsidies for green energy would eventually have to end, it was \"crucial\" that any reductions in subsidies for low-carbon energy were not imposed so suddenly that they would \"undermine the confidence of the private sector and hold back badly needed investment in the power sector\".Osborne's support for a new dash for gas was revealed in a letter he wrote to Ed Davey, the Libl Dem energy and climate change secretary, in July. \"We need a statement which gives a clear, strong signal that we regard unabated gas as able to play a core part of our electricity generation to at least 2030 \u2013 not just providing back-up for wind plant or peaking capacity,\" he wrote. \"This will provide context for the gas strategy and will help reassure investors, enabling investment in new gas power stations and the infrastructure that supports them such as pipelines between Norway and the UK which could enable us to become a gas hub. \"We should commit publicly to ensuring that British consumers will be able to get the benefits if the price of gas falls.\" However, speaking at an IMF/World Bank conference in Japan last Friday he admitted he was unhappy that energy prices were rising so fast: \"Of course I'm concerned when I see electricity bills going up, partly that is because of things beyond our control \u2013 what's happening in the world with oil prices and gas prices.\" Today an investigation by consumer magazine Which? finds that only one in 10 people can identify the cheapest energy deal when presented with a range of standard energy tariffs. When shown the tariffs in a simpler form, in the style of petrol forecourt displays, the number shot up to nine out of 10. Only 8% of the people could identify the cheapest deal out of the six leading suppliers' standard electricity tariffs, 60% got the answer wrong and 32% said they simply didn't know.",

      "bodyText": "Droughts, storms, floods \u2013 after this year's washout of a summer, it is hardly a surprise that farmers are warning of rising food prices on supermarket shelves. The price of wheat is 16% higher than this time last year; corn costs are up 7%; and there is an increasingly fierce battle about how to make the best use of agricultural land. But don't be fooled into thinking this is a simple tale of supply and demand \u2013 crops keeling over in the baking midwest sunshine and hungry mouths to feed thousands of miles away. The world market for food includes not just farmers and shoppers, but hundreds of millions of dollars of complex financial bets. Wall Street's geniuses are forever looking for new products to package and sell. Over the past decade, helped by a convincing pitch about hungry Chinese factory workers and harvests ravaged by climate change, they have persuaded investors, including ordinary pension funds, to plough billions of dollars into commodities, including food. The Institute of International Finance has estimated that by the middle of last year, $450bn of financial assets was invested in commodities \u2013 or derivatives, betting on future price movements. In principle, there would be nothing wrong with financiers moving into the food market if it directed billions of dollars of investment towards expanding production, bringing new land into cultivation and developing new technologies to boost yields. But \u2013 as the thoroughly mad market for mortgage-backed securities in the run-up to the credit crisis, and the resulting building boom across the US, illustrated very clearly \u2013 the price signals emerging from the stampeding herds of Wall street can be deeply misleading. In a recent paper, provocatively titled \"Don't Blame the Physical Markets,\" the UN's trade and development arm, Unctad, argued that the wall of money flooding into commodities has badly distorted the price signals a well-functioning market should send to producers and consumers. \"It is not commonly recognised that demand from financial investors in the commodity markets has become overwhelming during the last decade,\" Unctad says. It uses a striking pair of charts to show that over the past 10 years, the prices of food, and of commodities more generally, have moved closely into synch with other financial assets, such as stocks and shares. In 2002, west Texas oil prices, and an index of other commodities, shifted up and down largely independently of European equities \u2013 due to fluctuating supply and demand in those markets. But by the early part of this year, the three indices were moving in lockstep; and responding dramatically to each twist and turn of the ongoing eurozone crisis. \"Eurozone events and market sentiment determine commodity prices, regardless of trade logistics issues, war, drought and other ongoing supply shocks,\" Unctad says. In other words, the financialisation of the market for basic foodstuffs has led to prices drifting far away from the fundamentals of supply and demand, as investors treat betting on the future price of food as just another asset for their portfolio, bringing uncertainty and volatility, and masking the true balance between supply and demand. When the sub-prime bubble burst, it wrecked the livelihoods of millions of Americans who had battled hard to afford their own home. But in this case, it is the very lives of poor consumers that are at stake, as the price of food zig-zags about because of all-but-irrelevant events in Brussels or Berlin. Unctad urges the world's regulators to take a series of measures to check speculation. One of the steps it recommends, a financial transaction tax, now looks almost certain to be adopted by a coalition of at least 11 willing European countries, though it seems most likely that trading will simply shift to other jurisdictions \u2013 including the UK. Any tougher crackdown \u2013 forcing greater transparency about who is betting on what, with whom, for example \u2013 looks highly likely to be scuppered by the same kind of concerted lobbying that sank proposals for regulating other derivatives markets in the years before the crisis. In the US, for example, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission is facing a legal battle over its attempts to impose \"position limits\", constraining the share of the market single investors can hold in a number of commodities, including corn and cocoa. The proposal was struck down by a court in Washington, in a case brought by several financial sector trade bodies \u2013 though the CFTC has not given up on introducing position limits in some form. As the world struggles to adapt to a changing climate, and a rapidly expanding population with shifting nutritional needs, it is as important as it has ever been to ensure that farmers, policymakers and consumers are receiving the right signals about supply and demand. But as we should now have learned repeatedly, allowing the financiers to pile in en masse brings not the hard-nosed judgement of the market, but uncertainty, chaos and confusion.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "George Osborne's drastic deficit-cutting programme will have sucked \u00a376bn more out of the economy than he expected by 2015, according to estimates from the International Monetary Fund of the price of austerity. Christine Lagarde, the IMF's managing director, last week caused consternation among governments that have embarked on controversial spending cuts by arguing that the impact on economic growth may be greater than previously thought. The independent Office for Budget Responsibility implicitly used a \"fiscal multiplier\" of 0.5 to estimate the impact of the coalition's tax rises and spending cuts on the economy. That meant each pound of cuts was expected to reduce economic output by 50p. However, after examining the records of many countries that have embraced austerity since the financial crisis, the IMF reckons the true multiplier is 0.9-1.7. Calculations made for the Observer by the TUC reveal that if the real multiplier is 1.3 \u2013 the middle of the IMF's range \u2013 the OBR has underestimated the impact of the cuts by a cumulative \u00a376bn, more than 8% of GDP, over five years. Instead of shaving less than 1% off economic growth during this financial year, austerity has depressed it by more than 2%, helping to explain why the economy has plunged into a double-dip recession. Labour seized on the IMF's intervention as a vindication of shadow chancellor Ed Balls's argument that the cuts programme is self-defeating. \"The IMF's analysis should be a wake-up call for David Cameron and George Osborne,\" said the shadow chief secretary to the treasury, Rachel Reeves. \"It's time the prime minister and the chancellor listened to the evidence, accepted their plan isn't working and changed course.\" TUC general secretary Brendan Barber said: \"The chancellor has repeatedly used the IMF as cover for his austerity strategy, despite warnings that deep spending cuts in the midst of a global turndown would make a bad situation worse. Now that the IMF has admitted spending cuts could hit the economy at least twice as hard as it previously thought, the government has all the evidence it needs to change course.\" Neal Lawson, director of left-wing pressure group Compass, said, \"the cuts were never going to work, but these calculations show the effect is bigger than anyone judged. The economy isn't suffering from government borrowing but a severe lack of demand that only the government can fix.\" Osborne told reporters in Tokyo that the IMF does not allow for the boost provided to growth by the Bank of England's \u00a3375bn of quantitative easing. \"The point I would make about their study of the fiscal multipliers is that they explicitly say they were not taking into account offsetting monetary policy action. In the UK, I would argue we have a tough and credible fiscal policy to allow for loose and accommodative monetary policy and I think that is the right combination.\" But many economists believe the dent in growth caused by austerity policies may be larger than first thought, because the financial crisis has left banks starving firms and households of credit; and with many countries cutting back simultaneously, it is harder to fill the gap created by cuts with demand for exports. Former monetary policy committee member Danny Blanchflower said: \"In a way, the surprise is that it's taken everybody so long to work it out: Keynes knew it in the 1930s. This is the 'long, dragging conditions of semi-slump', and the multipliers are likely to be larger when you've got banks that aren't lending and you're coming out of the longest recession in 100 years.\" Adair Turner, chairman of the Financial Services Authority, said that the Treasury should have pumped even more into Britain's banks during the credit crisis to leave them in a stronger state. \"The recovery from recession has been far slower than most commentators and all official forecasts anticipated in 2009,\" he said. \"That reflects our failure to understand just how powerful are the deflationary effects created by deleveraging in the aftermath of financial crises.\" The OBR, set by Osborne to give an independent assessment of the economy, will publish a report on Tuesday explaining why it has consistently overestimated economic growth, and is expected to touch on the issue of whether the cuts are taking a greater-than-predicted toll. At its last forecast, in March, it predicted 0.8% growth this year; the IMF now expects the final figure to be -0.4%. \u2022 This article was amended on Sunday 14 October to add the word \"implicitly\" to clarify how the Office for Budget Responsibility used a \"fiscal multiplier\" to estimate the impact of the coalition's tax rises and spending cuts.",
