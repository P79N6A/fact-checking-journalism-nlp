      "bodyText": "A new law against corporate tax dodging will be announced in George Osborne's budget next month in the chancellor's latest effort to crack down on corporate tax avoidance after the Treasury shut down two schemes this week that Barclays used to avoid at least \u00a3500m of tax. Ministers are understood to have hardened their attitude over a new so-called \"generalised anti-avoidance rule\" after the government took the extremely unusual retrospective action to close down the two \"highly abusive schemes\". A Treasury spokesman said the legislation would be important in \"setting the tone\" of the contacts between government and large corporations. \"We want to have a relationship of trust with businesses on their tax behaviour,\" he said. The admission by Barclays that it was the bank being targeted prompted criticism of the government and the bank, which is now facing calls to axe the bonus of its chief executive Bob Diamond. Only a fortnight ago when he presented the bank's \u00a35.8bn profits for 2011, Diamond had been stressing the bank's commitment to \"citizenship\". On Tuesday, just hours after the minister responsible for rushing in the rule changes said the bank has suffered \"a substantial reputational hit\", Barclays said it took its responsibilities as a \"corporate citizen very seriously\". David Gauke, the exchequer secretary, who stunned the City on Monday by taking action to stop the tax avoidance, continued to refuse to identify the bank and had to defend the government for not taking any action to penalise Barclays, which has signed the government's code of conduct on tax under which signatories agree to comply with not only the letter of the tax law but also the spirit. Barclays now faces a tax bill of an estimated \u00a3300m to pay corporation tax on the \u00a31.1bn of profits it booked on buying back its own debt in 2011. The bank refused to comment on the size of its tax bill but would only say that it would \"not have material impact\" on its profits. The closure of the second scheme, which exploited rules around the taxation of authorised investment funds, may have been designed by Barclays for a client rather than for its own use. Liberal Democrat peer Lord Oakeshott called on the government to stand by its promise to make annual updates of compliance with the code. \"With the public facing an unprecedented squeeze in the budget, no one will believe Osborne's claim that we are all in it together unless banks and big business are clearly made to pay their fair share,\" he said: Barclays pay deals are due to be announced in the coming fortnight and shareholders are expected to ask the remuneration committee for any impact on bonuses caused by the tax controversy. \"Bob Diamond gave George Osborne a promise 15 months ago that this bank would not embark on tax planning that aims to achieve tax result that is contrary to the intentions of parliament. He's clearly and flagrantly broken that undertaking. He's trashed Barclays' brand and neither shareholders nor the public would understand if he got a penny of bonus,\" Oakeshott said. While the anti avoidance scheme was being drafted, it was facing criticism. Richard Murphy, of the Tax Justice Network, derided the idea as \"window dressing\". Writing on the Guardian's website, shadow exchequer minister Owen Smith was sceptical, saying the anti-avoidance measures would be \"a toothless tiger\". Barclays stressed that it had \"voluntarily disclosed\" the schemes to HMRC and had guidance from \"professional advisers that the treatment was legal and compliant with the tax code, and given others had used a similar treatment\" with regards to buying back debt. It had also disclosed its participation in an authorised investment fund which is \"also legal and compliant with the tax code.\" Barclays is among dozens of banks across Europe that have bought back debt. HMRC is looking to see if other banks are using similar tax treatment for bond buy backs. Royal Bank of Scotland, for instance, announced one on Tuesday andto avoid any doubt RBS spelt out that any profits would be subject to UK tax. A previous buy back it conducted in 2009 \u2013 making \u00a33.8bn of profits \u2013 was not liable for tax but the rules were changed the following year so the bailed out bank has paid tax since. Barclays by numbers 2011 Profits: \u00a35.9bn 2011 Tax paid: \u00a31.9bn (including staff income tax) 2011 UK corporation tax paid: \"relatively small amount\" 2010 Bob Diamond bonus: \u00a36.5m 2009 UK corporation tax paid: \u00a3113m (on record \u00a311.6bn profits).",

The businessmen implored Europeans to \"see through the stereotypes and realise that there is another Greece which believes in modernity, in the stability that being part of Europe brings, that is fighting a battle for change that can be won\". Greek police, firefighters and harbour police staged a rally in Athens on Tuesday night and the country's two biggest unions have called for a demonstration on Wednesday.",

    "webTitle": "Ireland set for referendum on eurozone fiscal treaty", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Ireland will be the first country in the eurozone to give a democratic verdict on the German-backed rules for the single currency after Dublin announced it would hold a referendum on the treaty. The euro declined on foreign exchanges after the Irish prime minister Enda Kenny told the D\u00e1il that the Republic's chief law officer had advised the cabinet that \"on balance\" a referendum should be held under the terms of the Irish constitution. Kenny is now expected to fight for concessions from Brussels on the terms of Ireland's swingeing euro bailout as the price for heading off a potentially embarrassing electoral rejection of the \"fiscal compact\" tightening rules for the 17 eurozone members. Ireland, which has twice rejected EU treaties, must hold a referendum on any international treaty that has an impact on the country's sovereignty. The plebiscite on the EU fiscal compact would have to be held by Easter and by June at the latest. The taoiseach said: \"It gives the Irish people the opportunity to reaffirm Ireland's commitment to membership of the euro, which remains a fundamental pillar of our economic and jobs strategy. More binding and enforceable fiscal rules as a result of ratification will be good for both Ireland and the wider eurozone, and will cement growing international confidence in Ireland's recovery.\" Neil Mellor, of the bank BNY Mellon, said Dublin's announcement raised fresh doubts about the future of the single currency, even before the latest bailout for Greece has been released. \"It's death by a thousand cuts,\" he said. Kenny was elected with a promise of extracting a better deal from Brussels and the ECB over the terms of the Irish rescue package, first agreed in November 2010. Sony Kapoor, of Brussels-based thinktank Re-Define, said the Irish government should win the referendum, which will be held in the summer \u2013 but only if Dublin can show that it is getting a good deal. \"If you look at Ireland and where it is now, the government is probably going to package it in a way that makes it more saleable, and link it to continued support \u2013 but they will press for concessions from Brussels, and they should get them.\" The taoiseach said he and deputy prime minister Eamon Gilmore were confident the Irish people would endorse the treaty, which will entrench tougher tax and spending rules, overseen from Brussels. An Irish no vote would be unlikely to derail the fiscal compact because only 12 euro countries have to ratify it before it can be enacted. But as well as ruling out any future bailout for Ireland, a rejection would be politically explosive, raising fresh doubts about public support for the single currency.. News came as financial markets were braced for the scale of the European Central Bank's latest bailout for the cash-strapped eurozone banking sector. The Frankfurt-based lender will today announce the take-up of its second so-called \"Long-Term Repo Operation\", which lends money to banks over three years at an interest rate of 1%. The first round saw \u20ac500bn (\u00a3423bn) flow into the financial sector, some of which was recycled into buying up the bonds of Spain and Italy, helping to bring bond yields down to more manageable levels. Tobias Blattner, euro economist at Daiwa Capital Markets, said lower than expected take-up this time around would cause the markets to question how effective the measure would be in delivering a fresh decline in yields; while a higher than expected number would suggest deep distress in the European banking sector. \"Anything that is in the corridor between \u20ac400bn and \u20ac600bn will send the best signal,\" he said. News of the Irish referendum raised the spectre of the first Lisbon Treaty, which Irish voters rejected in 2008, throwing the entire EU reform programme into chaos, although after a series of amendments the Republic's electorate later endorsed a second treaty. With the economy still deep in recession, unemployment running at 14% of the workforce and house prices down by half since their peak before the crisis, there are fears within the Fine Gael/Labour coalition that voters might use this latest referendum to punish the government. A small but increasingly vocal public campaign has begun to call for debt relief for Ireland, including forcing losses on the holders of Irish banks' bonds. The two governing parties and the main opposition party in the D\u00e1il, Fianna F\u00e1il will all urge a Yes vote. However, Sinn Fein, the United Left Alliance and a range of Independents will call for the treaty to be rejected. Sinn F\u00e9in president and Louth TD Gerry Adams said he welcomed the announcement of the referendum but said it marked a failure for the government because he said the Fine Gael/Labour Coalition wanted to avoid such a vote. Adams said the EU treaty will not help recovery and will condemn people to austerity. Fianna F\u00e1il leader Miche\u00e1l Martin said the Irish government should never have questioned the importance of holding a referendum. \"How can you honestly expect the people to be happy with a situation where a treaty is important enough to save the euro, but not important enough for them to have a say?\" he asked. Another of the eurozone's bailed-out member, Portugal, received a thumbs up from the \"troika\" of the IMF, ECB and Brussels in their latest quarterly review of its austerity programme, which found that the crisis-hit economy is making \"good progress\". But with GDP expected to contract by another 3.25% in 2012, the troika warned that \"significant challenges remain\". With Greek bondholders agreeing to take heavy losses as part of its latest bailout, speculation has been mounting over whether Portugal or Ireland could also restructure their debts.",

    "webTitle": "Tesco's market share slips again as customers defect", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Tesco's share of the supermarket trade has slipped to 29.7%, its lowest level for almost seven years. Britain's biggest retailer has seen shoppers increasingly defect to upmarket rivals as well as discount specialists such as Aldi and Lidl. Tesco remains Britain's leading supermarket, taking \u00a37.53bn at UK checkouts for the 12 weeks to 20 February \u2013 almost 70% more than closest competitor, Asda \u2013 but it lost ground to a range of smaller players which have a stronger focus on either value ranges or premium quality. In January, its market share dipped below 30% for the first time since 2005 after a particularly poor Christmas trading period. Industry figures, compiled by the market research firm Kantar, confirmed the setback a fortnight after Tesco issued a shock profits warning that wiped some \u00a35bn from the value of shares. The chief executive, Philip Clarke, admitted the group had been outmanoeuvred over Christmas, particularly on money-off coupon marketing in the UK. He added that Tesco also had deeper, \"long-standing business issues\" to address. A Tesco spokesman pointed out the latest market share data had not fully captured a step-up in sales performance over the last month, during which time Tesco had introduced competing coupon offers. These included a \u00a35-off voucher for two shops of more than \u00a340, and a 10p per litre petrol discount for shoppers spending \u00a360 or more in store. On Monday, Tesco announced another departure at the top of its British operations, with marketing director Carolyn Bradley leaving the UK board to take up a new role of group brand director. She is the second UK board director to go this month and she follows Bob Robbins, who effectively served as deputy to UK chief executive Richard Brasher. In both cases Tesco has insisted the shift from UK operations to newly created roles at group level do not amount to demotions. Bradley is to be replaced by David Wood, the commercial director in Hungary who has previous marketing experience with Unilever and Kraft. Meanwhile, Robbins is to be replaced by seasoned Tesco executive Chris Bush, who is returning from a role running operations in Thailand. \"I am sure you will join me in wishing Carolyn and David every success in their new roles,\" said Brasher in a message to staff. \"I know you will agree that these moves will better equip the business to make life better for our customers.\" Latest Kantar figures show that discount specialists Aldi and Lidl as well as value-focused frozen food store Iceland all recorded double-digit percentage rises in till receipts. Aldi led the pack, posting a 23.5% jump in sales to \u00a3920m helped by a store opening programme. At the other end of the price spectrum, there were share gains also for Waitrose and Sainsbury's. The former saw its share rise to a record 4.5%, up from 4.4% a year ago, while the latter edged up from 16.5% to 16.6%. Walmart-owned Asda, which completed its acquisition of the UK operations of Danish discount supermarket Netto last year, recorded a share of 17.5%. Edward Garner, director at Kantar Worldpanel, said: \"[Waitrose's] continuing strong performance shows that it is a mistake to talk about the 'average' UK shopper. Some consumers clearly value good service and in-store experience when shopping, which Waitrose claims to provide. \"At the same time, the 'two nations' phenomenon continues as value for money remains paramount for many shoppers, with Aldi, Lidl and Iceland all enjoying double-digit growth as they hold on to record shares.\" Overall, Kantar figures showed supermarket sales were continuing to expand at rate of about 4.5%. \"While [this] remains lower than grocery price inflation \u2013 currently at 5% \u2013 the gap between the two measures is narrowing, meaning pressure on household budgets, while still strong, is not getting any worse.\"",

      "body": "<p>Tesco's share of the supermarket trade has slipped to 29.7%, its lowest level for almost seven years. Britain's biggest retailer has seen shoppers increasingly defect to upmarket rivals as well as discount specialists such as Aldi and Lidl.</p> <p>Tesco remains Britain's leading supermarket, taking \u00a37.53bn at UK checkouts for the 12 weeks to 20 February \u2013 almost 70% more than closest competitor, Asda \u2013 but it lost ground to a range of smaller players which have a stronger focus on either value ranges or premium quality.</p> <p>In January, its market share <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/jan/31/tesco-lowest-market-share-2005\" title=\"\">dipped below 30% for the first time since 2005</a> after a particularly poor Christmas trading period. Industry figures, compiled by the market research firm Kantar, confirmed the setback a fortnight <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/jan/15/tesco-growth-megastores\" title=\"\">after Tesco issued a shock profits warning</a> that wiped some \u00a35bn from the value of shares. The chief executive, Philip Clarke, admitted the group had been outmanoeuvred over Christmas, particularly on money-off coupon marketing in the UK. He added that Tesco also had deeper, \"long-standing business issues\" to address.</p> <p>A Tesco spokesman pointed out the latest market share data had not fully captured a step-up in sales performance over the last month, during which time Tesco had introduced competing coupon offers. These included a \u00a35-off voucher for two shops of more than \u00a340, and a 10p per litre petrol discount for shoppers spending \u00a360 or more in store.</p> <p>On Monday, Tesco announced another departure at the top of its British operations, with marketing director Carolyn Bradley leaving the UK board to take up a new role of group brand director. She is the second UK board director to go this month and she follows Bob Robbins, who effectively served as deputy to UK chief executive Richard Brasher. In both cases Tesco has insisted the shift from UK operations to newly created roles at group level do not amount to demotions.</p> <p>Bradley is to be replaced by David Wood, the commercial director in Hungary who has previous marketing experience with Unilever and Kraft. Meanwhile, Robbins is to be replaced by seasoned Tesco executive Chris Bush, who is returning from a role running operations in Thailand.</p> <p>\"I am sure you will join me in wishing Carolyn and David every success in their new roles,\" said Brasher in a message to staff. \"I know you will agree that these moves will better equip the business to make life better for our customers.\"</p> <p>Latest Kantar figures show that discount specialists Aldi and Lidl as well as value-focused frozen food store Iceland all recorded double-digit percentage rises in till receipts. Aldi led the pack, posting a 23.5% jump in sales to \u00a3920m helped by a store opening programme.</p> <p>At the other end of the price spectrum, there were share gains also for Waitrose and Sainsbury's. The former saw its share rise to a record 4.5%, up from 4.4% a year ago, while the latter edged up from 16.5% to 16.6%. Walmart-owned Asda, which completed its acquisition of the UK operations of Danish discount supermarket Netto last year, recorded a share of 17.5%.</p> <p>Edward Garner, director at Kantar Worldpanel, said: \"[Waitrose's] continuing strong performance shows that it is a mistake to talk about the 'average' UK shopper. Some consumers clearly value good service and in-store experience when shopping, which Waitrose claims to provide.</p> <p>\"At the same time, the 'two nations' phenomenon continues as value for money remains paramount for many shoppers, with Aldi, Lidl and Iceland all enjoying double-digit growth as they hold on to record shares.\"</p> <p>Overall, Kantar figures showed supermarket sales were continuing to expand at rate of about 4.5%. \"While [this] remains lower than grocery price inflation \u2013 currently at 5% \u2013 the gap between the two measures is narrowing, meaning pressure on household budgets, while still strong, is not getting any worse.\"</p>",

Under the scheme, a Boeing 737-800 would be fitted out with 15 rows of seats and 10 rows of standing berths. Michael O'Leary, the budget airline's chief executive, said: \"We have asked the question could we run some trials on this and the immediate response is somewhat negative.\" Asked how upright passengers would cope without seatbelts, he said the refitted airplane would resemble a classic London Underground train with its distinctive ball-and-strap fittings, saying: \"Same as on the London Underground, handrails and straps.\". The Ryanair boss said seated passengers would be charged \u00a325 per ticket with standing customers paying between \u00a31 and \u00a35 for their fares on a flight that would take the average capacity of a flight from 189 passengers to 230. The proposal is the latest in a series of unrealised cost-cutting ruses that have earned the carrier free publicity and criticism from safety experts. O'Leary has claimed in the past that the carrier was looking at charging passengers for using the toilet, in a bid to limit loo facilities on planes and replace them with extra seats. Ryanair has also suggested it would put passengers in the hull \u2013 in bunks \u2013 and has called for flights with only one pilot instead of the usual two. Speaking at a press conference in London, O'Leary said he was undeterred by the knockback from the unnamed regulator, although he declined to comment on whether Ryanair had approached the US Federal Aviation Administration or the European Aviation Safety Agency. \"I think ultimately it would happen,\" said O'Leary.",

    "webTitle": "ECB to launch second wave of euro 'quantitative easing'", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The European Central Bank will on Wednesday step up its campaign to stabilise the euro, forestall a new credit crunch and shore up troubled banks by flooding the markets with hundreds of billions' worth of easy money for the second time in two months. The offer of three-year loans to banks at the cheap interest rate of 1% represents a boon for the banking sector in the troubled eurozone periphery, and is broadly seen as a masterstroke by ECB president Mario Draghi of Italy (pictured), who launched the policy in December in one of his first moves as president. Analysts speculate that the take-up of what amounts to a eurozone policy of quantitative easing could reach \u20ac1tn (\u00a3850bn) when the funds are made available, the expectation is that the borrowing will roughly equal the first round of lending in December when more than 500 EU banks netted \u20ac489bn. Draghi's decision took the heat off the ECB, which has been heavily criticised for declining to take a more interventionist role in the euro crisis. There have been calls for its rulebook to be rewritten to become the eurozone's lender of last resort, and for it to go on a bond-buying spree. Instead, the ECB in effect subcontracted the bond-buying role to the banks, especially in Italy and Spain, lending them cheap money that they then lent on to their governments at hefty profits. The policy has had the effect of bringing down soaring borrowing costs for Italy and Spain, increasing demand for vulnerable sovereign paper and easing the pressure on the eurozone at the height of the Greek debt drama. \"The ECB's December move to provide massively greater liquidity to the banking system was the single most important thing to happen in the eurozone last year,\" said Simon Tilford, chief economist at the Centre for European Reform thinktank. \"This has bought time by easing the pressures on the banks, who in turn have bought more government debt \u2013 at least in Italy and Spain \u2013 than had looked likely.\" The cheap money has overwhelmingly flowed to the eurozone's weakest corners, feeding a grumbling campaign that is getting louder in the northern, more disciplined creditor countries. Of the \u20ac489bn taken up in December, \u20ac325bn was tapped by banks in Greece, Ireland, Italy and Spain. December's move came at a time of intense political quarrelling over whether and how to save Greece. Draghi's policy has been broadly applauded, but the scheme is also becoming increasingly contentious. In the key eurozone country, Germany, it is being argued that the liquidity provision is risky, encouraging banks to take bad decisions, and that it is turning the eurozone surreptitiously into a \"transfer union\" where taxpayers in the northern creditor countries are ultimately liable for the easy profits accrued by southern European banks. There are also fears that the policy will erode Germany's strong credit rating. Central bankers in Germany and Finland have recently warned that excessive liquidity from the ECB is generating \"risky incentives\" in the banking sector, and they are not keen to see Frankfurt introduce a third round of cheap credit. Although the policy \"may mitigate the [eurozone] periphery's funding needs for some time to come, it is clear that several officials are concerned about the impact of liquidity provision upon risk-taking activity,\" said analyst Neil Mellor of Bank of New York Mellon. \"There is a genuine fear that unprecedented lending could even generate 'zombie' banks \u2026 The greatest risk is that in swelling its balance sheet, the ECB has become increasingly hostage to the fortunes of the eurozone economy and loans that are of unknown discounted value.\" The impact of the policy on the real economy also appears much more negligible than had been hoped. Draghi argued in December that the liquidity operations had prevented \"a major, major credit crunch\". But data from the ECB this week show the banks taking advantage of the scheme are opting to lend to their governments or to repair their own balance sheets, with lending to businesses and homeowners stagnating or receding. Bank lending to businesses collapsed by a huge \u20ac35bn in December and by a further billion last month. Lending to homebuyers was slower last month than in December, the ECB reported, 1.8% up on a year ago compared with 2.3% the previous month. \"There is no sign that the banks are stepping up their lending to business and households, and with the economic outlook so poor it is hard to see that changing over the coming months,\" said Tilford. \"There is no doubt that the banks' drive to shrink their balance sheets is exacerbating the economic downturn.\" Draghi acknowledged last week that if the aim was to maintain the supply of credit to businesses and households, the policy was less than successful. \"One expectation now is that having satisfied their funding needs for this year, at least the banks will be more inclined to use the money \u2013 which was our prime expectation really \u2013 to expand credit to the real economy,\" he said. \"We have certain aspirations and ambitions that what we do actually helps the real economy, and we will see what happens.\"",

    "webTitle": "How much profit will Northern Rock and Bradford & Bingley make for the taxpayer?", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "UK Financial Investments, which looks after the bailed-out banks on behalf of taxpayers, has produced the first real analysis on how much money might be made on Northern Rock and Bradford &amp; Bingley. It reckons that the \"wholly owned\" businesses will bring in between \u00a395bn and \u00a397bn \u2013 at least \u00a333bn more than was put in. As always there is a snag. It could take another 15 years for those sums of money to flow back to the exchequer. On Northern Rock, some \u00a346bn to \u00a348bn could be brought in to repay the \u00a336.8bn of taxpayer money pumped into the bank. On B&amp;B the profit could be as high as \u00a322bn, based on projections that the government will get back \u00a349bn after putting in \u00a327bn during the dark days after Lehman Brothers collapsed in September 2008. The Northern Rock calculation includes the \u00a3400m loss made on the sale of the \"good\" part of the Newcastle-based lender to Virgin Money at the end of last year. The profit will come from the \"bad\" bank \u2013 Northern Rock Asset Management \u2013 as it repays \u00a347bn in the coming 10 to 15 years. UKFI justifies the \u00a3977m sale to Virgin Money, despite it being made at a loss, by arguing (as the table shows) that it was the best value it could get against alternatives such as an immediate share sale through an initial public offering (\u00a3495m), a remutualisation (\u00a3437m) and a run off (\u00a3625m) or an IPO next year (\u00a3735m). While the headline figure on the Virgin sale was \u00a3747m, UKFI has based its calculations on projections by its advisers at Deutsche Bank that taxpayers will eventually get between \u00a3863m and \u00a3977m. Deutsche Bank sent out 24 information memorandums for the sale, including 10 private firms and four mutuals. In the end, none of the mutuals made a bid for the Rock.

It reckons that the \"wholly owned\" businesses will bring in between \u00a395bn and \u00a397bn \u2013 at least \u00a333bn more than was put in.</p> <p>As always there is a snag. It could take another 15 years for those sums of money to flow back to the exchequer.</p> <p>On Northern Rock, some \u00a346bn to \u00a348bn could be brought in to repay the \u00a336.8bn of taxpayer money pumped into the bank. On B&amp;B the profit could be as high as \u00a322bn, based on projections that the government will get back \u00a349bn after putting in \u00a327bn during the dark days after Lehman Brothers collapsed in September 2008.</p> <p>The Northern Rock calculation includes the \u00a3400m loss made on the sale of the \"good\" part of the Newcastle-based lender to Virgin Money at the end of last year. The profit will come from the \"bad\" bank \u2013 Northern Rock Asset Management \u2013 as it repays \u00a347bn in the coming 10 to 15 years.</p> <p>UKFI justifies the \u00a3977m sale to Virgin Money, despite it being made at a loss, by arguing (as the table shows) that it was the best value it could get against alternatives such as an immediate share sale through an initial public offering (\u00a3495m), a remutualisation (\u00a3437m) and a run off (\u00a3625m) or an IPO next year (\u00a3735m).</p> <p>While the headline figure on the Virgin sale was \u00a3747m, UKFI has based its calculations on projections by its advisers at Deutsche Bank that taxpayers will eventually get between \u00a3863m and \u00a3977m. Deutsche Bank sent out 24 information memorandums for the sale, including 10 private firms and four mutuals.

      "bodyText": "Shareholders in Persimmon are in for a tidy windfall, the housebuilder has announced it is returning \u00a31.9bn in surplus cash to investors following a jump in profits. The company, seen as a bellwether of the UK housing market, does not bring much cheer to homeowners and property investors, however. It predicts the UK housing market will \"remain difficult\". But Persimmon says its own focus on boosting margins has left underlying 2011 pre-tax profits up 55% on the year to \u00a3148.1m on revenues of \u00a31.54bn. That is even better than it had guided the market to expect back in January. The company said its operating margin improved to 10% from 8.2% in 2010, with second half improvement to 10.8%. It has raised its final dividend to 6.0p per share from 4.5p per share in 2010, making a total of 10.0p for the year, an increase of 33%. All that has propelled the shares to the top of the FTSE 250 leaders board. They are up 12.4%, or 78p, at 705p, the highest for almost four years. Housebuilders such as Taylor Wimpey and Bellway were by Persimmon's results. The near \u00a32bn in surplus going back to shareholders will be spread over 2013 to 2021 by way of dividends, Persimmon adds. In a statement, chairman Nicholas Wrigley puts the improvement in underlying profits down to a \"strategy of improving operating margins, investing in high quality land and generating surplus cash to pay down debt\", though he also notes \"difficult prevailing housing market conditions\". He adds: \"Looking ahead, we have made a strong start to the year, with forward sales up by 9.4% to \u00a3927m. Visitor levels and reservations continue on an improving trend and, although we expect the UK housing market to remain difficult, Persimmon is in a strong position to meet this challenge.\" Analysts Rachael Waring and Mark Hughes at Panmure have their recommendation on the shares under review. They commented: \"Persimmon's preliminary results are in line with our expectations and current trading appears to be robust. Perhaps the most significant information in this results announcement is news of a strategic review which will see \u00a31.9bn or 620p per share returned to shareholders over the next nine and a half years. This is likely to be well received by investors and our recommendation and target price are therefore under review for now.\"",

      "bodyText": "The Treasury has rushed in legislation to close down two \"aggressive\" tax avoidance schemes that a high-street bank had disclosed to HM Revenue and Customs in an effort to avoid tax. As it announced highly unusual steps to take retrospective action to shut down the \"highly abusive\" schemes, the Treasury refused to the name the bank involved, although the Guardian understands that it is Barclays. The bank has refused to comment. The government was immediately accused of making a \"mockery\" of its own code of conduct on tax \u2013 which 200 banks have signed to promise to comply with the spirit and not just the letter of the law \u2013 by refusing to identify the bank that the Treasury claimed would face a \u00a3500m tax bill. The Treasury also said that the move would prevent \"further billions of tax from being lost and maintain fairness in the tax system\". The detail was complex, but could have implications for any bank that is buying back its own debt \u2013 which has fallen in value because of the financial crisis \u2013 and making a profit as a result. One of the schemes being shut down allowed the bank to avoid paying corporation tax on the profit it makes from buying back its own debt. The second scheme involves authorised investment funds where the bank aims to convert non-taxable income into an amount carrying a repayable tax credit to secure a repayment from the exchequer even though tax has not been paid. Barclays is among dozens of banks across Europe that have bought back debt \u2013 it started doing so on 5 December. The Treasury has said that the retrospective element of its changes would date back to the start of December. The Treasury made clear that the bank had signed up to its code on conduct on tax. \"The government is clear that these are not transactions that a bank that has adopted the code should be undertaking,\" a Treasury spokesman said. But Lord Oakeshott, the Liberal Democrat peer, said last night that the Treasury's refusal to name the bank \"made a mockery\" of the code. David Gauke, exchequer secretary to the Treasury, said: \" We do not take today's action lightly, but the potential tax loss from this scheme and the history of previous abuse in this area mean that this is a circumstance where the decision to change the law with full retrospective effect is justified.\"",
