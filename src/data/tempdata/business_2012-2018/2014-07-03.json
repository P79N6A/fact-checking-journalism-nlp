    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The Dow Jones index has soared through the 17,000 barrier to a record high after US data showed a bigger-than-expected surge in job creation last month. Official figures showed an extra 288,000 jobs in June and the rate of unemployment in the US dropped to 6.1%, as businesses recovered from freezing weather in early spring. Stock markets in London, Paris and Frankfurt all rallied on the back of the job gains, which the US labour department said were widespread. The Dow closed at 17,068.26 on a shortened holiday session on Thursday, up 74 points and up 1,000 points since October last year. Wall Street analysts had expected about 215,000 jobs to be created in June, and an unchanged unemployment rate of 6.3%, or 9.8 million people out of work. That number fell to 9.5 million. Much of the pessimism ahead of the jobs report was based on figures showing the economy had shrunk by 2.9% in the first three months of the year. A crippling freeze which affected most of the country brought much activity in the construction and services sector to a halt, though the effects have proved largely temporary. The news will cheer the White House, as it shows businesses undeterred by higher costs from the expansion of healthcare and plans to make more workers eligible for time-and-a-half pay when they work overtime. Barack Obama has made several speeches in recent months calling for workers to enjoy a fair slice of the recovery and attacking banks for maintaining large bonus pots for risky trading activities. One analyst described the jobs report as a \"blockbuster\" that showed the US economy was roaring back to life. Marcus Bullus, trading director of MB Capital, said: \"Someone attached the jump leads to the US jobs market in June. \"The markets will go into the long weekend on a buzz, while strong upward revisions in April and May will add to the feelgood factor.\" The broad-based recovery saw growth in professional and business services, retail and food services. The number of long-term unemployed, those without work for 27 weeks or more, also declined by 293,000 in June, to 3.1 million. In May, these workers accounted for a little more than a third of the total number of unemployed. That number dropped to 32.8% of the total unemployed. The labour market participation rate, the number of people of working age who are working or seeking employment, held steady at 62.8%. The department also revised April and May job numbers up. In April they rose to 304,000 from 282,000, and in May the numbers went up from 217,000 to 224,000. Strong job figures were also recorded in the UK services industry following a surge in orders. The Markit Cips survey of the sector, which accounts for 77% of the economy, showed that a mild slowdown in growth during May and June is likely to be shortlived as orders boost activity in the second half of the year.",

      "bodyText": "A former Serco executive who oversaw custody contracts that are at the centre of a police inquiry has become a director of another company that also services Ministry of Justice contracts. Paul Rennie was Serco's head of custody services in London and the east of England from December 2011 to August 2013. Serco has since found evidence in those regions that prisoners had been recorded as delivered ready for court when they were not. Rennie left Serco in the same month as the MoJ began investigating a possible fraud worth up to \u00a340m and called in detectives from City of London police. He is now business development director at Taylormade, a security firm that is being subcontracted work by Serco from the prisoner escort contract. There is no implication that Rennie has done anything wrong, but both he and Serco do not wish to comment on why he left. Rennie says that he may be called as a witness in any subsequent criminal prosecution. Margaret Hodge, the chair of the Commons public accounts committee, said she would like both Rennie and the company to be open about his role because a firm in which he is involved is profiting from the same prisoner service contract. \"We have got to get answers to key questions as to why Paul Rennie left Serco and why he jumped just before a police investigation was launched, especially since he has since turned up at another company which benefits from similar contracts. \"At the very least this looks bad and it makes a case yet again for complete transparency where the taxpayer's money is involved.\" The development comes after the release of a highly critical report into Serco's custody services in the east of England. The chief inspector of prisons, Nick Hardwick, found that \"persistent and pressing\" staff shortages adversely affected people held in privately run court cells across Cambridgeshire and Essex. In August, the MoJ put Serco's \u00a3285m prisoner escorting and custody services (PECS) contract for London and the east of England under administrative supervision and called in police. Rennie left the firm earlier that month, according to his LinkedIn page. \"Interim audit findings suggest that some Serco staff have been manipulating their performance figures to show enhanced performance against this measure,\" the MoJ said in a statement. The firm has said it will repay \u00a32m of profits on the contract for transfers in London and East Anglia since 2011. Taylormade was given a contract by Serco in April 2013 to provide medical services in support of its prisoner escort contract. Serco also brings in custody officers from Taylormade on a temporary basis to meet high demand or fill vacant posts on the prisoner escort contract. Taylormade is also an approved Home Office contractor, providing emergency medical cover and support staff on deportations. The firm's website states that Taylormade is \"the sole medical provider to the Home office for repatriation of illegal immigrants and failed asylum seekers\". Rennie declined to answer the Guardian's questions about why he left Serco and whether it was appropriate for him to be working for a sub-contracted firm, saying he does not wish to prejudice any subsequent criminal prosecution. \"I am aware there has been a police investigation by City of London police. I do not know whether that is still ongoing. \"If it is, I would not wish to respond to your questions. If proceedings are brought against anyone, and I have no information whether or not they might be, I am conscious of the possibility that I may be asked to be a witness,\" he said. \"I have not recruited detention and custody officers and prison escort officers for Taylormade.\" Serco would not disclose if any staff have left the company over the fraud allegations. A spokesman told the Guardian: \"There have been a number of management changes both within the PECS contract and the wider business as a result of Serco's corporate renewal programme and internal restructure. \"This programme of renewal was positively assessed by the Cabinet Office at the end of January 2014.\" Frances Crook, the chief executive of the Howard League for Penal Reform, said: \"It is worth asking what corporate renewal means when managers can disappear then resurface as subcontractors.\" Regarding the report by the chief inspector of prisons, Serco's partnership director, David Holdsworth, said: \"While we are pleased that inspectors found our staff had good interpersonal skills and were courteous to detainees, we accept that there have been some staffing issues across Cambridgeshire and Essex and that there is room for improvement.\"",

      "bodyText": "The postwar baby boomers are often depicted as the lucky ones, benefiting from the huge gains in house prices and generous pension deals that are unlikely to be seen again. But a study of UK wages over the past four decades shows that later generations have been better paid, with those starting work in the 1990s earning more than those starting out in the 1970s, when taking inflation into account. Workers aged 21 in 1995 were paid an average of 40% more in real terms in their first 18 years employment than those aged 21 in 1975, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) found. The difference in pay means that people beginning their career in 1975 would have to work up to four years longer than those starting work in 1985 to accumulate the same earnings, and up to six years longer than those starting in 1995. \"On average, individuals who were 21 in 1975 have fared worse in terms of average pay over their career to 2013 than those who were 21 in 1985 and 1995,\" the ONS said. The trend can partly be explained by statutory wage freezes in the late 1970s and the series of recessions that have hit the older group but not those who started their careers in the 1990s. A broad shift in the UK economy between 1975 and 1995 away from manufacturing and towards higher paid financial services jobs is also likely to have had an impact. All three groups have suffered a fall in real pay since 2009, as inflation outpaced wage growth during the financial crisis, driving living standards lower. But again, those starting out on their career path in 1975 have been hardest hit. Average pay for workers starting work almost 40 years ago fell by 12% to \u00a311.03 per hour in 2013 from a peak of \u00a312.54 per hour in 2009. The equivalent fall for those who started 20 years ago was a smaller 10%, to \u00a312.72 last year from \u00a314.11 in 2009. \"Some of the decline for the 1975 group may be explained by people in their late 50s beginning to consider retirement, with the highest earners often retiring early. This would bring down average pay before any consideration is taken of the wider economic conditions,\" the ONS said. The study shows the introduction of the national minimum wage by the Labour government in 1998 has cut the gap between the best and worst paid. In 1998 Britain's highest paid workers earned 13 times more than the lowest paid. By 2013 that had fallen to 11 times. Between 1975 and 1998, real pay growth for the highest 1% of earners was 138%, more than double the rate of growth among the lowest paid which was 63%. But between 1998 and 2013, real pay grew 21% for the top earners, and 49% for the bottom 1%. Frances O'Grady, TUC general secretary, said more needed to be done for the poorest members of society. \"The last 40 years show a picture of growing wage inequality. The more you earn, the faster your pay goes up, while the less you earn the slower it goes up. The minimum wage has bucked this trend for the very poorest, but we need to go further. \"A short-term fall in inequality from the financial crisis hitting top earners is not the lasting change we need. Now the economy is growing again, the priority must be a pay rise for Britain's workers. It's time to build on the minimum wage and bring in living wages to end the injustice of in-work poverty.\" The ONS said the pay gap between men and women under 30 had \"decreased dramatically\" since 1975. In 2013, the difference in pay was close to zero between the sexes up to age 30. But the gap starts to widen after 30 and by age 49 men were paid an average of 45% more than women last year. An earlier study by the Institute for Fiscal Studies showed that although they enjoyed higher incomes during early adulthood than their predecessors, children of the 1960s and 1970s spent the extra cash. They were also less likely to own a home than the postwar baby boomers before them, and likely to have smaller private pension pots.",

Here's a flavour of his take:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/janet-yellen\">Janet Yellen</a>, the Fed's chairman, seems relaxed enough with the way things are. She has expressed a willingness to leave policy on hold, with a gradual tapering away of the asset-purchase programme and no increase in interest rates until there is either a fall in the unemployment rate below 6% or there is an obvious acceleration in wage growth.</p> <p>After describing signs of growing inflationary pressure as \"noise\", Yellen will no doubt be comforted by the latest data from the Department for Labor in Washington showing wages were up 2% in the year to June, slightly down on the 2.1% increase recorded in May.</p> <p>That, though, is a bit misleading since the fall in the annual rate of earnings growth has more to do with what was happening last year than what is happening this. A bounceback in wage growth is highly likely in July.</p> </blockquote> <p>Which means Wall Street is going to remain jittery about US inflation rates over the summer...</p> <h2>Here's the full piece: <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/economics-blog/2014/jul/03/us-unemployment-falls-federal-reserve\">US unemployment falls to 6.1% - and should keep on falling</a></h2> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-53b562a7e4b014db09bcc775\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2014-07-03T14:03:22.645Z\">3.03pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/WSJmarkets/statuses/484695601414934529\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>Break out the hats!

      "bodyText": "A positive response to the forecast beating US jobs data has pushed markets sharply higher, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average breaking through 17,000 for the first time, writes Nick Fletcher. And with suggestions the strong non-farm payrolls number could bring forward a US rate rise from the Federal Reserve, the dollar has also strengthened. Markets continue to be supported not only by the recent spate of reasonable economic data but also the continuing benefits or central bank stimulus measures (a US rate rise notwithstanding). So the final scores showed: \u2022 The FTSE 100 finished 48.84 points or 0.72% better at 6865.21 \u2022 Germany's Dax jumped 1.19% to 10,029.43 \u2022 France's Cac climbed 1.02% to 4489.88 \u2022 Italy's FTSE MIB added 0.95% to 21,884.60 \u2022 Spain's Ibex ended 0.67% higher at 11,090.0 In the US the Dow is holding on to its gains, up 0.49% at 17,058.73. And on that upbeat note, it's time to close up for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we'll be back again tomorrow. Meanwhile, ECB expert Frederik Ducrozet of Credit Agricole has chewed his way though the details of the offer of \u20ac400bn of cheap loans for the eurozone banks: Back on the ECB, and Marc Ostwald of Monument Securities suspects Mario Draghi has been playing tricks by announcing the plan to release the accounts of its meetings: The fact that the biggest \"news\" from the ECB press conference is the switch to a 6 week cycle of meetings and the confirmation that meeting minutes will be published (both as of January 2015), certainly goes with the idea of this having been a \"non-event\" of a meeting. Indeed, one might suggest that this was a distracting tactic, given that both decisions were in principle agreed a long time ago, and because the ECB council knew that it had little else to offer, in terms of still missing details to the measures announced last month. Clearly Draghi and his fellow council members were more than acutely aware that the absence of further details on the June measures, on the AQR results, and their clear determination to avoid having to field too many 'probing' questions on the parameters of the outlook for conventional policy measures, left them needing a 'distractor' announcement such as this. Ostwald is also struck by the irony of Mario Draghi criticising markets for obsessing over every piece of detail, while also promising them extra infomation: With 8 meetings per annum and an additional 8 meeting minutes release dates, the fact is that there will in principle be more rather less \"event risk\" surrounding ECB policy, at least from the perspective of financial markets. Mohamed El-Erian, chief economic adviser at Allianz SE (and once of Pimco), sums up the mood on Wall Street about today's Non-Farm payroll: \"It\u2019s an extremely bullish report. Not only did you\uf702have a gangbusters headline and private read but you had a diffusion index that was 64.8, which shows significantly healthy breadth. It\u2019s a report that really checks off all the positive boxes, I don\u2019t think you could have asked for a stronger read.\" The diffusion index, incidentally, measures the breadth of industries who are adding to their workforces. It had fallen to 62.7 in May. And here's the graph showing how US wage growth dipped last month. Over on Business Insider, Joe Weisenthal explains how that muted earnings growth \"takes a little bit of pressure off everyone\". The strong US jobs report probably won't provoke a change in policy at the Federal Reserve, but might encourage \"a change in the rhetoric\" around future monetary policy soon.. So argues Larry Elliott, our economics editor. Here's a flavour of his take: Janet Yellen, the Fed's chairman, seems relaxed enough with the way things are. She has expressed a willingness to leave policy on hold, with a gradual tapering away of the asset-purchase programme and no increase in interest rates until there is either a fall in the unemployment rate below 6% or there is an obvious acceleration in wage growth. After describing signs of growing inflationary pressure as \"noise\", Yellen will no doubt be comforted by the latest data from the Department for Labor in Washington showing wages were up 2% in the year to June, slightly down on the 2.1% increase recorded in May. That, though, is a bit misleading since the fall in the annual rate of earnings growth has more to do with what was happening last year than what is happening this. A bounceback in wage growth is highly likely in July. Which means Wall Street is going to remain jittery about US inflation rates over the summer... Here's the full piece: US unemployment falls to 6.1% - and should keep on falling Back in the markets, the US Dow Jones index has hit its highest level ever, breaking through the 17,000 point mark for the first time ever. The news that 288,000 new jobs were created in America last month, bringing the jobless rate down to 6.1% (story here), pushed shares higher on Wall Street. The Dow has gained 67 points, or 0.4%, to 17043. Of course, it's only a number (on an index of just 30 companies).... More importantly, US government debt prices have weakened, pushing up the yield on 10-year Treasury bonds up 4 basis points to 2.67%, from 2.63% yesterday. That suggests some traders are concluding that the recovery in US labour market means the Federal Reserve will tighten policy sooner than before. Although it's not a given Must confess I struggled to capture Draghi's precise explanation of how the new TLTRO programme will work (at 1.49pm) (judging from Twitter I wasn't alone). Fortunately, this press release outlines the key points: And don't expect any help with the technical details of the offer of cheap loans to euro banks, just released: And finally, Mario Draghi is asked about a research paper suggesting that the eurozone banking sector is too fat, and would benefit from consolidation. What's his take? It's an interesting paper, very interesting, the ECB governor replies. Banks are a product of history, he point out. The industry has developed over centuries influenced by all kinds of factors A programme of mergers and acquisitions would be challenging, he points out, but not impossible. Would it be inappropriate? One can't really rule out the need for this. And with that, he clears off -- the ECB is now holding a press conference to explain the details of its TLTRO programme. Draghi embarks on a long answer to a question on credit availability in the euro area. The key points is that there's been marginal improvement in credit growth, but it's very timid. Draghi does seem a little heated about market expectations today. Asked whether there is less pressure on the ECB to take further unconventional measures, he warns that there is a risk of \"continuing self-fulfilling expectations\". Maybe we should move to a six-monthly reporting cycle, he jokes (I think). Draghi doesn't appear to appreciate being asked about operating in the shadow of the Federal Reserve, with the markets being more driven by the Fed than the ECB. Will the ECB take a closer look at the legal risks being run by eurozone banks, following BNP Paribas's $8.8bn fine for sanction-busting? There is already provisioning for legal risk, Draghi replies, but he agrees that this is a most important issue, and the ECB isn't blind to it. The issue is to see whether these provisions are adequate, and also to look where banks carry out their activities. Draghi gently chides the financial markets for their habit of reacting strongly to gobbets of information flying their way. We often see market reaction that have no relation to fundamentals... we act when needed, he says. No escape from World Cup analogies... Draghi says the shift to a six-week meeting cycle is designed to allow the ECB to publish minutes in an orderly way without spooking the markets. Not quite convinced by this one -- the Bank of England manages it. But maybe I'm missing something... The better than expected US non-farm payroll data showed job creation in June was widespread across sectors but professional and business services, retail, food and drink and health care saw the strongest growth. The number of unemployed people fell by 325,000 to 9.5m in June, while the labour force participation rate was 62.8% for a third month. The euro has fallen through the $1.36 point against the dollar, as traders take a view that Draghi is being quite dovish today. Draghi reiterates the point that the ECB is still committed to potentially using unconventional measures if needed. We don't think our job is finished, not at all. ECB expert Lorcan Roche Kelly points out that we may be wrong to talk about minutes -- we might get Federal Reserve-style forecasts for future interest rates, growth and inflation. Could interest rates be cut further, or do last month's cuts mean we've hit rock bottom? Draghi says he can't rule out technical adjustment to rates, and justifies the negative interest rates impose on banks, saying they helped to avoid narrowing the rate corridor. Claire Jones of the FT seeks more information on the ECB's plan to release minutes -- what will they include? It's too early to say, Draghi replies. The governing council need to decide what to put into the accounts, and what to leave out -- such as whether to include voting details. And what do you think about the warning from BIS last weekend that central banks risk creating a new crisis by leaving interest rates so low? Draghi explains that policymakers discussed this over the weekend. We think that monetary policy is perfectly appropriate to delivering our mandate of price stability. But we are sensitive to the presence of potential financial stability risks, he adds - saying the ECB has already taken various steps to prevent its measures fuelling excessive risk. And he then makes an important point that the rules of central banking have changed since the crisis: The first line of defence against financial stablity risks should be the macro-prudential tools. I don't think people would support raising interest rates now...that would be an interesting proposition, and not one I could support. Yesterday, the Bank op England's Andy Haldane said macro-prudential tools are a \"new arm\" for central banks to use. Draghi's giving a long answer about the ECB's work on creating an ABS (asset-backed securities) market \u2013 in which loans could be bundled up and sold on. He says it's crucial to make sure that no exotic derivatives, such \"as CDS-squared\" securities, are used. This is meant to encourage proper lending. But he also points out that if interest rates stay so low, then banks may be less interested in ABS's as they can access cash very cheaply today. Here's our news story on the US jobs data: US adds 288,000 jobs in June as unemployment rate drops to 6.1% A six-weekly cycle means three or four fewer meetings per year for the ECB. I'm sure Draghi will miss seeing the press pack as often, though Next question -- how will the ECB timetable its move to six-weekly meetings, and will it synchronise its meetings with the Federal Reserve? We don't plan to synchronise our meetings with anyone else, really, says Draghi -- sounding a little dismissive of the suggestion that the mighty ECB might play second fiddle to anyone else. Onto questions -- can Draghi give more details about the TLTRO programme? The ECB governor says that this offer of cheap loans to banks will be a big help in driving inflation back towards target. Banks can bid for loans individually, or in groups. They'll be able to borrow up to 7% of their total lending to the eurozone non-financial sector. And they'll be able to generate extra loans if they hit certain benchmarks (designed to encourage lending to the 'real economy') Six TLTROs will take place at quarterly intervals. Draghi concedes that it's complicated, but also attractive to banks. Draghi's pulled a rabbit out of the hat -- The ECB is to move to a six-week cycle of meetings, rather than monthly. So, eight meetings a year (like the Federal Reserve), rather than 12. And it will start to publish the minutes of its meetings, from January 2015. Draghi makes his usual plea to governments not to unravel progress in structural reforms. On the economic picture, Draghi says that eurozone unemployment is still too high. Risks to the economic outlook are still to the downside, including the threat from geopolitical developments. The ECB will publish more details about its \u20ac400bn TLTRO programme (announced last month) after the press conference. TLTRO offers cheap loans to commercial banks, as long as they use the cash to lend to small businesses. Mario Draghi reiterates the ECB's forward guidance, that eurozone interest rates will remain at present or lower levels for an extended period. And he emphasises that \"the governing council is also unanimous in its commitment to use unconventional instruments' if necessary, to address the risk of too-prolonged period of low inflation. So QE is still in the toolbox, Mario Draghi's appeared in Frankfurt, and started reading out his prepared statement. No early fireworks. He says that the European economy maintained its moderate recovery in the second quarter Inflation expectations remain firmly anchored, he adds. The measures we announced last month have helped to further ease our monetary policy stance. US non-farm payrolls rose by 288,000 in June, much sharper than expected. Economists polled by Reuters were expecting a 212,000 rise. The figure for May was also revised up to 224,000 from an earlier estimate of 217,000. Meanwhile the unemployment rate dropped to 6.1%, which is the lowest rate since September 2008, the same month that US investment bank Lehman Brothers collapsed. Economists had expected the jobless rate to remain unchanged at 6.3%. Growth in average hourly earnings was unchanged in June at 0.2%. So all in all a strong jobs report from the US Bureau of Labor Statistics. Reaction to the numbers is coming in. Angus Campbell, senior analyst at FxPro: Many investors have been waiting for stronger evidence that the world\u2019s largest economy is in good shape and today certainly does that. This will allow the Federal Reserve to continue in its tapering and even prepare the ground for raising rates next year. Dennis de Jong, managing director at UFXMarkets: This is the fifth successive month the reading has risen above 200,000 with job growth significantly rebounding this quarter following a poor start to the year. The third quarter officially opened yesterday ahead of Independence Day celebrations. Positive news has been sparse of late and this is as good an excuse as any to enjoy this weekend\u2019s fireworks. Rob Carnell, chief economist, ING Global: Without a clear step up in wages, and whilst the unemployment rate remains 6-something percent, we suspect the Fed will be loathe to change its formal stance with respect to the taper, or to the possibility of normalising rates. The time is soon coming that the FOMC will have to change its tack with respect to its policy stance, and forward guidance. Today\u2019s release takes us a little closer to that point, but as FOMC chair Yellen\u2019s recent testimony shows, they are not there yet. One minute to go.... our friends in the US are getting a little excited (reminder, today's non-farm payroll has been brought forward a day because of the Fourth of July holidays tomorrow) Mario Draghi's press conference will be streamed live here (right-click to open in a new tab) OK, it's about to get quite busy. At 1.30pm BST sharp, the US Bureau of Labour Statistics will release data showing how many new jobs were created in the US in June. Economists expect that the latest US non-farm payroll report probably increased by around 215,000. The unemployment rate, 6.3% last month, may fall further. But the big interest could be on how much US workers' wages rose last month. That will help show whether inflationary pressures are building. At the same moment, Mario Draghi will start explaining this month's interest rate decision (no change). Journalists in Frankfurt will quiz the ECB chairman on a range of issues, including: \u2022 is the central bank any closer to launching quantitative easing \u2022 What progress has been made on developing a programme to allow loans to small firms to be bundled together and sold on (which could encourage banks to lend). \u2022 What's his view of the eurozone economy, given this month's PMI surveys have suggested growth slowed in June? Angela Monaghan and I will try to cover both stories between us... File this one under 'unsurprising'. The European Central Bank has left interest rates unchanged across the eurozone. This means the main refinancing rate stays at its record low of 0.15%. Banks are still being hit with negative interest rates when they leave cash at the ECB -- with the deposit facility rate pegged at -0.10%. And the marginal lending rate (charged when banks borrow overnight from the ECB) remains at 0.4%. Mario Draghi will discuss the decision at his press conference in Frankfurt at 1.30pm BST, or 2.30pm. With 80 minutes to go until the US jobs data is released, predictions are flying around. Bloomberg has been tracking the various guesstimates being posted on social media, and reports that the average prediction is that around 230,000 new jobs were created last month. Of course, the number of jobs created isn't the only thing that matters. The unemployment rate could trickle down from 6.3% to 6.2%. But a lot of economists will be looking at the earnings data, for signs that US wages are creeping up. That would add to inflationary pressure in the US economy, a key factor in how the Federal Reserve normalises monetary policy. Missed this earlier... but Markit's Chris Williamson predicted that France's economy shrank by 0.1% in the last quarter (see here for details of this morning's service sector survey) Ireland has taken another step away from the turmoil of its bailout, by posting solid growth for the first three months of the year. Gross national product across Ireland rose by 0.5% in the January-March quarter, and was 3.4% higher than a year ago. And GDP, which includes multinational companies based in Ireland, jumped by a whopping 2.7% in the quarter, and was 4.1% higher on an annual basis. Last year's growth figures have been revised higher too, to show that GDP rose by 0.2% during 2013, up from -0.3%. Over in Slovenia, the outgoing prime minister is trying to slam the brakes on the country's privatisation programme, at least temporarily. Alenka Bratusek tweeted that she will propose pausing the process until a snap election has been held, on 13 July. Which translates as: \"I will propose to the government today that we require SDH to stop all privatisation processes until a new government is in place.\" SDH is the government body handling the privatisation of around 15 state-controlled companies. These asset sales are part of Slovenia's strategy to clean up its banking sector and avoid a bailout. They are also unpopular with the Slovenian public, so Bratusek may be looking to drum up support ahead of the election. The vote was called after Bratusek lost the leadership of her party, amid unhappiness with her austerity programme. The leader of the opposition SMC party, which is leading the polls, said yesterday that he opposes selling off telecom operator Telekom Slovenia and airport Aerodrom Ljubljana, although it's not clear if it can be halted. Even a temporary pause in the sell-off process is likely to push down the amount of money that Slovenia can raise, according to Primoz Cencelj, a fixed-income portfolio manager at investment firm KD Skladi (via Reuters). Speaking of the Bank of England...deputy governor Sir Jon Cunliffe has warned that the housing market is the \"biggest risk\" to the UK economy. Here's our take: Housing market threatening UK economy, Bank of England official says Foreign exchange traders are also suggesting that the first UK interest rate rise could come in four months time Jake Trask, corporate dealer at UKForex, explains: An interesting note in the service sector report concerned the plummeting rate of unemployment: currently sitting at 6.6%, it expects the rate to possibly dip below 6% by the end of the year, adding to the argument for an interest rate rise in time for November\u2019s Inflation Report. With MPC members becoming more and more hawkish in tone recently, this is still a distinct possibility.\u201d The Bank of England is likely to raise interest rates before Christmas, reckons Rob Wood, chief UK economist at Berenberg. Wood says that this morning's service sector PMI report, which followed upbeat surveys from the UK's builders and factory, shows the recovery is 'increasingly balanced'. And the reports of wage growth suggests that the spare capacity in the economy is being used up. Wood says: Booming employment strengthens the case for a November rate hike. The PMIs signal that further very rapid falls in unemployment are in prospect, which will put pressure on the BoE to hike rates earlier than they may have been planning on a few months ago. We expect the first rate hike in November this year. Services firms reported a record increase in payrolls in June, while manufacturers said jobs numbers increased the most in 39 months. The tightening labour market is feeding through to better wage growth according to the PMIs. Services firms reported stronger pay growth, while construction firms recorded rapid input cost inflation. David Noble, CEO of the Chartered Institute of Purchasing &amp; Supply, says today's report shows there was a \"hiring spree\" in the UK service sector last month, as new business poured in: As levels of activity surged higher, along with strong customer demand and favourable market conditions, job creation accelerated to a record survey high in June. With optimism increasing and momentum continuing to build, there is no evidence to suggest that the speed in the recovery is about to slow down anytime soon. But despite the jump in employment, firms also reported an increased backlog of work....and a rise in wages. Noble explains: Reflecting these shortages in staffing levels, wages increased during this month, pushing running costs up. Services companies have been, however, only able to pass on a limited proportion of these higher costs to clients. Overall in June, the UK services sector, alongside strong performances from manufacturing and construction, has cemented expectations that the economic recovery can power ahead into the second half of the year.\u201d Britain's service sector has recorded another month of strong growth, with firms taking on new staff at a record rate and pushing up wages. Data firm Markit's monthly survey of the sector showed that activity within Britain's dominant sector continued to rise in June. With new business hitting its highest level this year, firms hired more staff at an \"unprecedented\" rate. And there are encouraging signs that workers are managing to squeeze pay rises out of their bosses. As Markit explains: A by-product of the tightening service sector labour market was reports of increased wages. The headline service sector PMI did fall a little, to 57.7 from 58.6 in May. But that still shows a healthy rise in activity (any reading over 50=growth). And with new business volumes at a six month high, business confidence remained strong. Chris Williamson, Chief Economist at Markit, says the UK economy continued to \"boom\" in June: \"Alongside an ongoing surge in construction and the largest quarterly rise in manufacturing output for 20 years, the services PMI confirms that the economy is firing on all cylinders. We expect the economy to grow by 0.8% again in the second quarter, taking GDP to a new all-time high. \u201cA renewed upturn in growth of new orders across all three sectors suggests that the economy should also pick up speed again as we move into the second half of the year. Reaction to follow.... Ahha, here's a handy chart showing how the Swedish central bank loosened monetary policy this morning, by cutting rates and predicting they will stay low for longer. The eurozone's private sector has just posted its best quarter of growth since the debt crisis began, according to data firm Markit. But there are fears that the recovery may be slowing. Markit's monthly PMI surveys suggest that the euro area grew 0.4% in the last quarter, twice as fast as in Q1. But the date for June is a little less bright -- Markit's Eurozone Composite Output Index fell to 52.8, down from 53.5 in May. That's the lowest reading this year. As Markit puts it: The eurozone economy saw further solid growth of output in June, rounding off the best quarter of economic expansion in the region for three years. The outlook for the second half of the year was mixed, however, as signs that the upturn in output was losing momentum were offset by stronger inflows of incoming new business. But as flagged up earlier, France's private sector lagged behind, with the sharpest contraction of output for four months in June. Business activity and new orders contracted in both the French manufacturing and service sectors. Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit, is cautious, but reckons : \u201cAt first glance, June\u2019s PMI survey results make grim reading and raise worries that the euro area\u2019s recovery is already fading. Output growth slowed for a second successive month, to the weakest since December. Growth in the region\u2019s main engine, Germany, is fading, while France has entered another downturn. \u201cDig a little deeper, however, and there are grounds for optimism. We should not lose sight of the fact that, even with the slowdown, the June data round off the best quarter for three years. We should expect economic growth to strengthen from the 0.2% rise seen in the first quarter to perhaps 0.4% in the second quarter. \u201cWith new orders rising at the fastest rate for three years, the pace of economic growth should also pick up again as we move into the second half of the year.\" Germany's service sector has reported a slowdown in growth -- with its PMI dipping to 54.6, from 56.0 in May. That means the wider German private sector has expanded at its slowest rate in eight months; another sign that the eurozone recovery is slowing a little. But the overall picture in Germany still looks decent. Service sector firms said they were benefitting from a jump in new orders, leading them to keep taking on more staff. The rate of job creation eased only marginally from May\u201fs near three-year high and was sharp overall. Markit. which compiled the report, predicts that the German economy grew by 0.7% in the last three months -- a marginal slowdown on the 0.8% in the first quarter. But there's more gloom for France -- activity in its service sector activity has fallen for the second month running. Its service sector PMI slipped to a four-month low of 48.2, down from 49.1 in May, which means a sharper contraction (any reading below 50 shows a fall in activity) French firms reported that outstanding business fell, leading firms to cut staff for the eighth month running. This follows a weak manufacturing PMI report earlier this week. Put together, it indicates that the French private sector is struggling. Duncan Head, the Markit economist who compiled the report comments: \u201cThe French service sector disappointed during June, contracting for the second month in a row. Companies pointed to lacklustre demand as the primary cause of the sustained fall in new business. In response, firms shed staff for the eighth month in sequence. To add to the concern, strong competitive pressures continued to weigh on companies\u2019 pricing power while input cost inflation continued to grow, placing greater constraints on firms\u2019 operating margins. As was the case last month, there appears to be limited evidence of an up- turn in the French economy after the poor GDP figures from earlier in the year.\u201d Italy's service sector has posted its strongest rise in activity since November 2010. Its Services PMI jumped to 53.9, up from, 51.6, showing an acceleration in growth. Firms reported a jump in incoming new work in the sector, the sharpest since July 2007. And after some rough years, Italian firms are more upbeat about the future. The confidence measure hit its second-highest level in the past 37 months, down only slightly on March\u2019s recent high. Anecdotal evidence suggested that companies are hopeful of expansion in market activity leading to new contract wins. The Swedish central bank has just surprised the markets by slashing interest rates by 0.5 percentage points, to just 0.25%. The Riksbank made the shock move after concluding the inflationary pressures are even lower than it thought in April. It also adjusted its forward guidance; declaring that it doesn't expect to start raising rates until the end of 2015. The move sent the Swedish crown sliding to its weakest level against the euro this year. Analysts had only expected a quarter-point rate cut. The announcement also shows that the decision wasn't unanimous. Two members of the rate-setting committee, including central bank chief Stefan Ingves himself, The statement says: Governor Stefan Ingves and First Deputy Governor Kerstin af Jochnick entered a reservation against the decision to cut the repo rate to 0.25 and against the repo-rate path in the Monetary Policy Report. They advocated cutting the repo rate by 0.25 percentage points to 0.5 per cent and a repo-rate path in which the repo rate remains at 0.5 per cent until 2016 and is slowly raised thereafter. Update: the Norwegian Krone was also hit: The first major European service sector report is out -- and it shows that Spain's service companies continued to grow in June, but at a slower pace. The Spanish service sector PMI came in at 54.8 in June, down from 55.7 in May. That means the sector has grown for the last eight months, helping to pull the economy out of recession. However, this is the weakest rise in activity in three months. On the jobs front, companies increased their staffing levels during June. Employment rose for the third month running, although the rate of job creation remained only modest, Markit (which compiled the report) said. Shares in Balfour Beatty have slumped 10% after a disappointing trading update this morning. The engineering firm told investors that trading has worsened at its mechanical and electrical engineering division (already a sore spot) had worsened, meaning profits will be \u00a335m below forecast. Balfour said it had found new problems at its Engineering Services business, as it \"strengthened management control and project reviews\". They include: design changes, project delays, rework on projects and contractual disputes on a number of projects. Balfour had tried to reassure investors that its overall profit forecast was unchanged, as it can generate profits by selling its stake in certain public-private partnerships. But investors aren't impressed, sending shares sliding 23p to 209p. That knocks around \u00a3160m off its market value, I reckon. Greek citizens face the prospect of power cuts today, as workers at the country's Public Power Corporation begin a series of rolling blackouts. They're protesting against the government's plans to sell off PPC, as part of its bailout programme. A bill to partly privatise the company is being debated in parliament today. The unions are planning to put different areas of Greece offline at different times, rather than pulling all the switches at once. Union chief Giorgos Adamidis told the Kathimerini newspaper: \u201cThere is no danger of a blackout,\u201d \u201cWe are going on strike at all of PPC\u2019s production units and mines from Komotini to Arcadia but nobody said that all the plants would go off line at the same time. The action will be staggered because nobody wants the country to be plunged into darkness.\u201d As usual, economists have a wide range of forecasts for how many new jobs were created across the US economy last month. Predictions for today's non-farm payroll range from a paltry 160,000 new jobs to a rip-roaring 290,000. So the correct answer is \"probably in there somewhere\", as Michael Hewson of CMC Markets puts it. Capital Economics predict that non-farm payroll employment increased by a healthy 200,000 in June. That would be similar to May\u2019s increase of 217,000 and would probably be enough to push the unemployment rate down to 6.2%, from 6.3% in May Initial jobless claims have remained close to a seven-year low and the employment balances of most of the activity surveys have improved. This chart from Marketwatch shows how the NFP has been pretty steady so far this year: Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the financial markets, the world economy, business and the eurozone. There's a bumper crop of economic data heading down the slipway today. The monthly US unemployment payroll report, always a big event for the markets, has been hauled forward from tomorrow because of the Fourth of July holiday. Economists will be looking to see whether American firms kept hiring staff at a steady rate last month; a strong increase in the payroll will suggest the US economy recovered from its 'deep freeze' contraction last winter. Conversely, a weak number will raise fears that the recovery isn't as strong as hoped, and could cause ructions in the markets. The Non-Farm is released at 1.30pm BST.... ...which, slightly irksomely, is also the moment when Mario Draghi, ECB president, begins his monthly press conference. We're not expecting any changes in monetary policy today, given the stimulus measures taken a month ago, but you can't rule out a few fireworks from \"Super Mario\". We also get fresh information on the health of the European economy, with the monthly PMI reports for the service sector. Analysts fear that France's service sector will have suffered a fall in activity, while Germany, Spain and Italy should all have grown. And in the corporate world, Poundland are reporting that profits have jumped by a quarter, while cinema chain Cineworld is blaming the World Cup for a dip in admissions in the last few weeks (more on those shortly). I'll be tracking the key points through the day...",

It turns out he needn't have worried, as not only did the June numbers beat expectations, but the April and May numbers were revised up as well.

      "bodyText": "Leading shares surged to a three week high, helped by the Dow Jones Industrial Average hitting 17,000 for the first time following positive US jobs figures. The FTSE 100 finished 48.84 points higher at 6865.21, its best level since 10 June on the combination of upbeat economic data and the continuing support of central bank stimulus measures. The index is now within 65 points of its all time record close. Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK, said: European markets had been on a firmer footing even before this afternoon's US jobs report, given that the European Central Bank surprised nobody by leaving policy unchanged. Heading into the long US weekend expectations had been high that this afternoon's US jobs report was going to be a good one, and I'm sure the ECB President had his fingers crossed that the numbers would follow on from yesterday's ADP numbers, and help make his job easier in terms of weakening the euro at the expense of the US dollar. It turns out he needn't have worried, as not only did the June numbers beat expectations, but the April and May numbers were revised up as well. Against this backdrop Europe's markets have remained well supported continuing to build on this week's gains with the German Dax regaining the 10,000 level for the first time in nearly two weeks. There were a broad range of risers, with mining group Antofagasta adding 38.5p to 820p and Fresnillo rising 29p to 933.5p. Sports Direct International was the biggest riser in the leading index after shareholders approved the controversial bonus plan for Mike Ashley (and others, of course). Its shares ended 41p better at 769p. Liberum analysts said: From an investment perspective, we think that resolution of this issue removes a degree of uncertainty around the business and we can now re-focus on the longer term growth story.

We would see the recent share price weakness as an opportunity to buy ahead of preliminary results on 17 July (we expect the company to meet market expectations of around \u00a3330m underlying EBITDA). But a dip on the oil price helped send Royal Dutch Shell A shares 26p lower to \u00a324.04 and BP down 2.9p to 516.9p. Back with retail, Poundland put on 13.2p to 341.9p after well received results showed an 18% rise in first quarter sales. Tesco was up 5.85p at 290.8p and Morrisons climbed 2.6p to 182.2p after Nomura added both to its European recommended portfolio. But Balfour Beatty dropped 10.5p or 4.5% to 222.5p after it said it would take a \u00a335m hit to profits following poor trading at its mechanical and electrical engineering division. Brewer Greene King lost 30.5p to 816.5p despite a 7.4% rise in full year profits to \u00a3173.1m, as trading in the early part of the year proved disappointing. Numis said: We are holding our consensus-in- line 2015 forecasts, which anticipate 4% pretax profit growth. Given this and having missed out in the bidding for Orchid, we expect Greene King to be looking for acquisitions. However, like for like sales are up a disappointing 1.1% in early 2015 despite the fine weather, the World Cup and relatively easy comparisons. Elsewhere troubled outsourcer Serco slipped 3.3p to 363p as it warned that it will need to make provisions in its first half figures for a number of loss-making contracts. Lower down the market MoPowered fell 3p to 29p after the mobile commerce specialist - which warned on Tuesday that contract delays would hit its results - said finance director Ben Carswell was stepping down with immediate effect. Finally Quadrise Fuels International jumped nearly 16% to 36.5p as its low-cost alternative to fuel oil in the shipping, refining and power generation markets moved closer to commercial production.

    "webTitle": "Asda to cut 1,360 jobs", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Asda is cutting 1,360 middle managers, redeploying staff into fast-growing online shopping jobs as it attempts to take out \u00a31bn in costs over the next five years. The Walmart-owned company said 4,100 staff were affected by the restructuring, which creates 5,670 new roles, many of them lower-paid, linked to the faster-growing home-shopping business. The supermarket said the staffing shakeup was in response to \"intense structural changes\" in the grocery market. The big four supermarkets are all seeking to cut costs as the era of big box retail comes to an end. On the one hand they are being forced to cut prices to compete with the fast-growing food discounters Aldi and Lidl, but they also need to invest in new sales channels such as the internet and home grocery deliveries. \"As much as it is my job, and privilege, to be chief executive of this business and to do what is right for Asda as a whole, this is one of the most difficult decisions I've had to make,\" said its chief executive, Andy Clarke. \"Whilst I genuinely believe that it is the right decision for the future of Asda, knowing that it will result in valued colleagues leaving us is not easy. Every supermarket must adapt to the intense changes in UK retailing or they will get left behind.\" The job cuts come months after Asda was praised by the prime minister, David Cameron, for its plans to create 12,000 new jobs over the next five years as it opened new stores. At that time, Doug McMillon, president and chief executive of Walmart, said the company was \"creating more new jobs and bringing real value to more customers in the UK\". The shakeup was first announced in May, when Asda said as many as 2,600 staff could go. Staff canteens are also being closed \u2013 replaced with vending machines. Asda's chief operating officer, Mark Ibbotson, who is leading the cost-reduction project, said: \"We believe we are about 18 months ahead of our competitors. They're all going to have to do this.\" In June Morrisons also announced it was consulting staff about store management changes that could lead to as many as 2,600 job losses. Asda said the changes created \"more flexible store management structures to satisfy the constantly evolving shopping habits of supermarket customers today and in the future\". The company said the new structure put a greater emphasis on e-commerce and removed back-office administration tasks. Over the coming weeks managers affected by the changes will either begin training for their new jobs or take a redundancy package, it said. Before the recession the discounters were dismissed as a sideshow in UK food retail, but their rapid growth means that, taken together, Aldi and Lidl are now a bigger force than the Co-op, the country's fifth-largest supermarket chain. Some analysts believe they are a bigger strategic threat to the big supermarkets than the internet. Last month, Sainsbury's announced a joint venture with Denmark's biggest retailer, Dansk Supermarked, to relaunch the Netto discount brand in Britain, with 15 stores expected to open by the end of 2015. Shore Capital analyst Clive Black said supermarket bosses were being forced to tackle their labour costs as it is the only lever they can pull in a market where there is weak demand and intense price competition. \"It is our central expectation that more jobs will go at the big supermarkets, with major initiatives expected to come with respect to head-office headcount across the industry,\" he said. After keeping a tight hold of the purse strings during the recession, Britons now buy less to avoid wasting food and make more frequent top-up shops at small stores as opposed to doing one large weekly shop. These changes put pressure on the economics of big box stores, which have high fixed costs. \"We believe that Sainsbury's and Tesco will also announce in due course material productivity programmes involving labour shedding,\" adds Black in a note.",

      "body": "<p>Asda is cutting 1,360 middle managers, redeploying staff into fast-growing online shopping jobs as it attempts to take out \u00a31bn in costs over the next five years.</p> <p>The Walmart-owned company said 4,100 staff were affected by the restructuring, which creates 5,670 new roles, many of them lower-paid, linked to the faster-growing home-shopping business.</p> <p>The supermarket said the staffing shakeup was in response to \"intense structural changes\" in the grocery market. The big four supermarkets are all seeking to cut costs as the era of big box retail comes to an end. On the one hand they are being forced to cut prices to compete with the fast-growing food discounters Aldi and Lidl, but they also need to invest in new sales channels such as the internet and home grocery deliveries.</p> <p>\"As much as it is my job, and privilege, to be chief executive of this business and to do what is right for Asda as a whole, this is one of the most difficult decisions I've had to make,\" said its chief executive, Andy Clarke. \"Whilst I genuinely believe that it is the right decision for the future of Asda, knowing that it will result in valued colleagues leaving us is not easy. Every supermarket must adapt to the intense changes in UK retailing or they will get left behind.\"</p> <p>The job cuts come months after Asda was <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/apr/07/asda-jobs-walmart-david-cameron\" title=\"\">praised by the prime minister, David Cameron, for its plans to create 12,000 new jobs</a> over the next five years as it opened new stores. At that time, Doug McMillon, president and chief executive of Walmart, said the company was \"creating more new jobs and bringing real value to more customers in the UK\".</p> <p>The shakeup <a href=\"https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/?pli=1#inbox/146fc6410ce6ac1d\" title=\"\">was first announced in May</a>, when Asda said as many as 2,600 staff could go. Staff canteens are also being closed \u2013 replaced with vending machines. Asda's chief operating officer, Mark Ibbotson, who is leading the cost-reduction project, said: \"We believe we are about 18 months ahead of our competitors. They're all going to have to do this.\"</p> <p>In June Morrisons also announced it was consulting staff about <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/jun/17/morrisons-2600-management-jobs-cut-supermarket\" title=\"\">store management changes that could lead to as many as 2,600 job losses</a>.</p> <p>Asda said the changes created \"more flexible store management structures to satisfy the constantly evolving shopping habits of supermarket customers today and in the future\". The company said the new structure put a greater emphasis on e-commerce and removed back-office administration tasks. Over the coming weeks managers affected by the changes will either begin training for their new jobs or take a redundancy package, it said.</p> <p>Before the recession the discounters were dismissed as a sideshow in UK food retail, but their rapid growth means that, taken together, Aldi and Lidl are now a bigger force than the Co-op, the country's fifth-largest supermarket chain. Some analysts believe they are a bigger strategic threat to the big supermarkets than the internet. Last month, Sainsbury's announced a joint venture with Denmark's biggest retailer, Dansk Supermarked, to relaunch the Netto discount brand in Britain, with 15 stores expected to open by the end of 2015.</p> <p>Shore Capital analyst Clive Black said supermarket bosses were being forced to tackle their labour costs as it is the only lever they can pull in a market where there is weak demand and intense price competition. \"It is our central expectation that more jobs will go at the big supermarkets, with major initiatives expected to come with respect to head-office headcount across the industry,\" he said.</p> <p>After keeping a tight hold of the purse strings during the recession, Britons now buy less to avoid wasting food and make more frequent top-up shops at small stores as opposed to doing one large weekly shop.</p> <p>These changes put pressure on the economics of big box stores, which have high fixed costs. \"We believe that Sainsbury's and Tesco will also announce in due course material productivity programmes involving labour shedding,\" adds Black in a note.</p>",

Probably not for now, although a change in the rhetoric is perhaps not that far off. Janet Yellen, the Fed's chairman, seems relaxed enough with the way things are. She has expressed a willingness to leave policy on hold, with a gradual tapering away of the asset-purchase programme and no increase in interest rates until there is either a fall in the unemployment rate below 6% or there is an obvious acceleration in wage growth. After describing signs of growing inflationary pressure as \"noise\", Yellen will no doubt be comforted by the latest data from the Department for Labor in Washington showing wages were up 2% in the year to June, slightly down on the 2.1% increase recorded in May. That, though, is a bit misleading since the fall in the annual rate of earnings growth has more to do with what was happening last year than what is happening this. A bounceback in wage growth is highly likely in July. With every sign that the US economy has recovered strongly from its weather-related contraction in the first quarter of 2014, unemployment looks set to carry on falling. The Fed thinks the level of unemployment consistent with stable inflation is between 5.2% and 5.5%, not much lower than the current jobless rate. Once unemployment dips below 6%, Wall Street is going to get jumpy about inflation, whatever the Fed might say.",

      "bodyText": "Ryanair is restarting British domestic services, with daily flights from Glasgow and Edinburgh to London starting in the autumn. The Irish airline abandoned internal flights three years ago but believes a changing market and its own focus on business passengers makes the routes viable. Ryanair will operate three daily services each way from Stansted to the Scottish cities, setting up operations at Glasgow International instead of Prestwick for the first time. It will start selling tickets on Friday for services beginning on 26 October at a lead-in price of \u00a319.99 \u2013 despite air passenger duty costing \u00a313 on each ticket. Ryanair's chief marketing officer, Kenny Jacobs, said average fares would be higher but that the airline would have more seats available at its headline price than its competitors at their best advertised fares. Other airlines have struggled to make internal services turn a profit, with British Airways relinquishing several routes when it swallowed up bmi. Virgin Atlantic's domestic service, Little Red, operating between Scotland and Heathrow, flew with little more than a third of seats occupied in 2013. Jacobs said Ryanair was confident it would fill its planes because of lower overheads than other airlines. He said: \"We have the most straightforward operation and the best deals with the airports. Now we've got this metronomic, seven days a week schedule, and good deals, we'll be filling the aircraft.\" He said he thought \"others will reconsider\" whether their operations are viable. The airline is also increasing the number of flights on other European business routes from Stansted, with enhanced daily schedules to 14 destinations from autumn, including four daily returns to Barcelona and three to Madrid and Lisbon. Ryanair said the flights would help it grow its comparatively low market share in the UK, which at 13% is behind EasyJet and British Airways. The first five of its 180 new 737 planes on order arrive in September. Andrew Harrison, managing director of Stansted airport, said the new schedules were \"another demonstration of the strength of the relationships we have since agreeing targets for long-term growth\". The airport's owners, MAG, signed a 10-year growth deal with Ryanair, its biggest customer, to boost customer numbers soon after buying Stansted from Heathrow last year. Both parties are targeting a business market they believe is expanding in what they term the \"London-Cambridge corridor\".",

Now we've got this metronomic, seven days a week schedule, and good deals, we'll be filling the aircraft.\" He said he thought \"others will reconsider\" whether their operations are viable.</p> <p>The airline is also increasing the number of flights on other European business routes from Stansted, with enhanced daily schedules to 14 destinations from autumn, including four daily returns to Barcelona and three to Madrid and Lisbon. Ryanair said the flights would help it grow its comparatively low market share in the UK, which at 13% is behind EasyJet and British Airways. The first five of its 180 new 737 planes on order arrive in September.</p> <p>Andrew Harrison, managing director of Stansted airport, said the new schedules were \"another demonstration of the strength of the relationships we have since agreeing targets for long-term growth\". The airport's owners, MAG, signed a 10-year growth deal with Ryanair, its biggest customer, to boost customer numbers soon after buying Stansted from Heathrow last year. Both parties are targeting a business market they believe is expanding in what they term the \"London-Cambridge corridor\".</p>",

      "bodyText": "Britain's service sector is gearing up for a strong second half to the year following a surge in new orders last month, according to figures from financial data provider Markit. Activity across the sector slowed slightly from May to June, but firms remained buoyant about their prospects through the summer and autumn, matching their enthusiasm with a strong increase in marketing costs and jobs. Following figures showing both manufacturing and construction gaining in strength, service sector expansion indicated that GDP growth will remain at an annual rate of 3% until 2015. Jonathan Loynes, the chief European economist at consultancy Capital Economics, said that while June marked the second month of falls in the Markit CIPS index, the available data points to a quickening in the economic recovery in the second quarter. \"Accordingly, we think that GDP could rise by a quarterly 1% or so in the second quarter,\" he said. The main business activity index fell from 58.6 in May to 57.7 in June where a figure above 50 indicates growth. The services sector accounts for 77% of the economy and has proved to be the bedrock of economic expansion following consistent growth since 2012. In 2013, it became the first sector to regain all the ground lost in the recession. There has been a tendency for employers to hire staff on low wages to fulfil orders rather than invest in new premises and equipment, but a rise in new work and a tightening job market is likely to force firms to change course. Markit said new orders, which have expanded each month for the last 18, grew in June at the sharpest pace in six months. \"Latest data marked the 18th month in succession that a rise in new work has been signalled, with panellists reporting that trading conditions remained positive and market confidence high in June. Marketing activities and better weather were also noted as factors driving new business higher,\" the report said. Employment soared, with over 27% of the survey panel recording an increase in staff numbers since May. Chris Williamson, chief economist at financial data provider Markit, said: \"Yet another strong service sector PMI number indicates the UK economy continued to boom at the end of the second quarter. Alongside similar surveys showing an ongoing surge in construction and the largest quarterly rise in manufacturing output for 20 years, the services PMI confirms that the UK economy is firing on all cylinders. \"The persistent strength of the three Markit/CIPS PMI surveys suggests that we should expect the economy to grow by 0.8% again in the second quarter, taking GDP to a new all-time high.\" He said with the Bank of England expecting the economy to slow in the second half of the year, the persistent strength across manufacturing, construction and services raises the likelihood of policymakers deciding for a pre-emptive rise in interest rates later this year. \"Pressure is building for policymakers to ensure that they do not delay the first rate hike too long and end up having to tighten policy more aggressively than would be the case under an earlier series of small rate hikes,\" he said. The Bank of England's monetary policy committee, which sets interest rates, is concerned that while employment has increased, much of it has been among the self-employed and wage rises across most sectors remain weak. Firms reported that the tightening labour market was starting to drive up wages and their own costs, though they were still unable to pass on higher prices to customers.",

With more than half of British shoppers having now picked up online orders from a store or other convenient spots, Amazon has put collection lockers in Co-op and other stores, while retailers including John Lewis are working with Collect+, a scheme that allows shoppers to pick up and return items bought online at more than 5,000 independent retailers. Argos began trials with eBay in 2013, allowing shoppers to collect goods from 50 online sellers at 150 stores, and Argos boss John Walden has suggested that if the tie-up is successful Argos might look at offering similar services to other retailers or brands.

      "bodyText": "High household debt is a key risk to the recovery, the Bank of England deputy governor Sir Jon Cunliffe has warned, saying the Bank's measures to rein in the housing market should be thought of as insurance against a major crash. In a speech at the International Festival for Business in Liverpool, Cunliffe said UK household debt was equal to 135% of household earnings, compared with 110% in 2000, although it reached 165% in the runup to the financial crisis. The level was markedly higher than in other European countries and on a par with the US, he said. Last week, the Bank's financial policy committee (FPC) laid out the first limits on the mortgage market in 30 years, to limit risky lending. Lenders must check that mortgage applicants can cope with a rise of three percentage points in interest rates \u2013 slightly tougher than current affordability checks \u2013 and from October there will be a 15% cap on the number of mortgages that banks and building societies can give to people who want to borrow more than 4.5 times their income. Cunliffe, in charge of financial stability at the central bank, said the main risk from the housing market was that house prices would continue to grow strongly and faster than earnings and lead to more household debt: \"In short, the risk that more people take on higher debt relative to their income as they have to stretch further to buy homes.\" \"An outcome in which house prices grow more rapidly relative to income and do so for longer is \u2026 quite plausible,\" he said. \"It has certainly happened before in the UK. We know the pressure from demand for homes is great and that the supply of new homes is quite weak. \"The stress test of the major UK banks towards the end of the year will assess the resilience of the system to a major crash,\" he said. \"The steps taken last week are insurance against the possibility of a sustained boom in the housing market leading to a substantial increase and concentration in household debt that could make a crash more likely and more severe.\" His comments came after figures from Nationwide, Britain's biggest building society, showed that the average price of a property in London had risen by more than a quarter, to \u00a3400,404, over the past year, a rate of growth not seen since the summer of 1987. In an earlier interview with BBC Radio 5 Live, Cunliffe identified the housing market as the \"biggest risk\" to the UK economy. A few days ago he warned said that Britain's obsession with home ownership could leave the Bank powerless to control household debt . The International Monetary Fund has told the government that rapidly growing house prices are the biggest threat to the UK's economic recovery.",

But this recovery was a long time coming and the level of GDP is still well below that which would have been anticipated pre-crisis. </p> <p>When viewed in this context of the level of activity rather than growth rates it\u2019s clear there is still a lot of slack to be absorbed. This makes it less surprising that inflationary pressures are not mounting (see chart).</p> <p>In the service sector more than 50% of total costs are labour costs on average. The fact that this subcomponent remains reasonably subdued suggests wages are not accelerating.

      "bodyText": "Karen Ward, senior global economist, HSBC Activity in the UK service sector is still robust and supports our view that growth in the second quarter will be at least as robust as that registered in the first. But this recovery was a long time coming and the level of GDP is still well below that which would have been anticipated pre-crisis. When viewed in this context of the level of activity rather than growth rates it\u2019s clear there is still a lot of slack to be absorbed. This makes it less surprising that inflationary pressures are not mounting (see chart). In the service sector more than 50% of total costs are labour costs on average. The fact that this subcomponent remains reasonably subdued suggests wages are not accelerating. Until they do the Bank of England is likely to maintain interest rates at their current rate and focus on cooling excesses in the property market with macroprudential policy.

Workers beginning their careers in 1995 were paid an average of 40% more in real terms \u2013 when adjusted for inflation \u2013 in their first 18 years than those who started in 1975 according to a new report by the Office for National Statistics. The difference in pay means that people beginning their career in 1975 would have to work up to four years longer than those starting work in 1985 to accumulate the same amount of earnings, and up to six years longer than those starting in 1995. \u201cOn average, individuals who were 21 in 1975 have fared worse in terms of average pay over their career to 2013 than those who were 21 in 1985 and 1995,\u201d the ONS said. All three groups have suffered a fall in real pay since 2009, as inflation outpaced wage growth, driving living standards lower. However, those who joined the workforce in 1975 have suffered the biggest wage falls during the financial crisis. Average pay for workers starting out almost 40 years ago fell by 12% to \u00a311.03 an hour in 2013 from a peak of \u00a312.54 an hour in 2009. The equivalent fall for those who started out 20 years ago was a smaller 10%, to \u00a312.72 last year from \u00a314.12 in 2009. \u201cSome of the decline for the 1975 group may be explained by people in their late 50s beginning to consider retirement, with the highest earners often retiring early. This would bring down average pay before any consideration is taken of the wider economic conditions.\u201d The ONS said the pay gap between men and women under the age of 30 had \u201cdecreased dramatically\u201d since 1975. Wage inequality has also fallen since the introduction of the National Minimum Wage in 1999. In 2013 the highest paid employees earned 11 times more than the lowest paid, down from 13 times in 1998. There are regional variations however, with wage inequality highest in London in 2013, and lowest in Wales.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The boss of a US retailer that has laid out two takeover plans for Mothercare is to fly to London to persuade shareholders to put pressure on its directors to enter talks. The Destination Maternity chief executive, Ed Krell, is to embark on a charm offensive to persuade investors of the merits of a deal and outline the rationale of his \u00a3266m takeover proposal. Last night he called on shareholders to press the board into talks. \"We really think our latest offer of \u00a33 [per share] is very attractive. We are very hopeful \u2026 they will want Mothercare's board to engage with us,\" he said. Destination Maternity runs 1,906 stores in North America but is smaller than Mothercare in terms of stock market value. It claims to be the world's biggest seller of maternity wear but its attempts to expand outside the US have been limited. It intends to revive Mothercare's 220 UK stores by adding its own products. Krell talked of a \"halo effect\" \u2013 by luring in shoppers earlier in their pregnancy. Destination Maternity's approach at 300p a share, including 230p in cash, was 29% higher than Mothercare's closing price on Tuesday and 90% more than the price on 26 May \u2013 the day before the US firm's first approach at 250p-275p a share. Mothercare shares last night closed up 19.5p at 252p, well short of the proposed bid price. The Philadelphia-based company said the combined business would be incorporated in Britain with its shares traded in the US. Mothercare is the third UK business in recent weeks to be targeted by US companies wanting to relocate to the UK for tax reasons while keeping their share listing in the US. The British drug companies AstraZeneca and Shire have both rebuffed approaches from rivals proposing a so-called tax inversion into the UK. Krell denied tax savings were the main reason behind the proposed takeover. \"It's the icing on the cake, not the cake itself. The cake is creating a global leader.\" He added: \"We believe there is a compelling strategic rationale for a combination of Destination Maternity and Mothercare, which would create the undisputed global leader in maternity, baby and young children's apparel and products.\" Mothercare's 1,221 international stores are another attraction. Krell refused to say whether he would mount a hostile bid if he could not persuade the firm to talk takeover terms. \"We want to do a transaction that has the support of the Mothercare board and we want to engage with them on a friendly basis. If something really makes sense there should be a way to make that happen.\" Mothercare has struggled in recent years and in January issued a profits warning. Its dire trading led to the departure of Simon Calver as chief executive in February. But it reported better than expected annual profits in May and revealed that banks to which it owes \u00a346.5m had given its turnaround plan more time. Alan Parker, the Mothercare chairman, said the US company's offer was too low and its proposals did not \"reflect the inherent value of Mothercare to our shareholders or its prospects for recovery and growth. In addition, we have significant concerns about the deliverability of these proposals. Mothercare has a very strong and valuable international business and significant potential for sustained improvement in the UK.\" Sanjay Vidyarthi, an analyst at Liberum Capital, suggested that Destination's \"ability to execute the deal is not clear-cut. The rationale for the business combination is also not obvious in terms of solving Mothercare's UK problems.\" Destination Maternity has also suffered poor trading and issued a profit warning in April, predicting falling annual sales. Its net profit for the three months to the end of March almost halved. Krell accepted that the \"retail environment remains very challenging in the US\" but pointed to the firm's turnaround since he took the job in 2008, with profits more than doubling and debt being reduced to zero from $118m (\u00a386m) in 2006. One top-10 Mothercare shareholder argued that the company was undervalued because the focus was on its loss-making UK business and not its international success. Matthew Tillett, a portfolio manager at Allianz Global Investors, said: \"How many UK retail businesses have successfully exported their brand overseas? It is certainly easy to think of many that haven't: Tesco, Marks &amp; Spencer, Dixons, Laura Ashley, Mulberry, to name a few.

However the compensation element of the scheme offers no extra redress for clients who may have lost their life savings up to 11 years ago and suffered the knock-on effects to their cost of living, according to information given by the bank\u2019s chief executive on Thursday. The head of the Commonwealth Bank Australia (CBA), Ian Narev, \u201cunreservedly\" apologised to the customers affected by the actions of financial advisers and other staff at Commonwealth Financial Planning Limited. A Senate inquiry into the Australian Securities and Investment Commission (Asic) and the Commonwealth Bank scandal last week labelled the conduct of \u201ca number of rogue advisers\u201d unethical, dishonest, a grievous breach of duties and deliberate neglect of clients, in order to benefit their own interests. It also found the CBA\u2019s compliance regime failed, and both the bank and Asic \u201cseemed to place reports of fraud in the \u2018too-hard basket\u2019\u201d. It called for a royal commission to investigate. Some actions included clients with \u201cconservative risk positions\u201d such as retirees having their investments placed in high-risk products without their knowledge by an adviser who would receive bonuses and recognition as a \u201chigh performer\u201d. \u201cWe are truly sorry and we acknowledge the financial hardship you suffered as a result of the poor advice, and that is the most critical message underlying what we\u2019re doing today,\u201d said Narev. The Open Advice Review Program, which Narev said would be operational by mid-August, offers any clients of the bank\u2019s Commonwealth Financial Planning or Financial Wisdom businesses between September 2003 and 1 July 2012 an assessment of any advice they received. Following the assessment, the client will be offered an \u201cindependent customer advocate\u201d. Should the client disagree with CBA\u2019s assessment of their advice they can access a further review by an independent panel to determine compensation. The CBA will be bound by those outcomes but the clients will not be if they wish to pursue it further. Any compensation will be based on the difference between the actual outcome and what would have happened to the client\u2019s investment if the adviser had not acted fraudulently and had instead placed them in the correct portfolio. Asked by Guardian Australia if that meant there was no consideration for extra compensation for clients who have dealt with the fallout from their losses for up to 10 years as a result of the advisers\u2019 actions, Narev confirmed this. \u201cWe\u2019re going to be dealing with it on the basis that whatever portfolio they should have been put in compared to the portfolio they were put in, and trace the performance over the time that they\u2019ve owned it,\u201d he said. \u201cTo that extent we\u2019re still sort of on market risk on some aspect of those portfolios because of the time that has lapsed since they\u2019ve held the investments.\u201d John Berrill, a principal at Maurice Blackburn lawyers, which acted for a number of victims who went through the original CBA review scheme, said there should be compensation for the knock-on effects of fraudulent advice. \u201cThere\u2019s no doubt that, for example, if a retiree bought a house in anticipation that they were going to have a nest egg of a certain amount, and then they have a nest egg that\u2019s a lot less than that because of this financial advice, and they had to sell the house when the market was low \u2013that\u2019s a consequential loss,\u201d Berrill told Guardian Australia. \u201cConsequential losses is an integral part of damages under the law,\u201d he said. \u201cIt should be included, if it\u2019s not \u2013 and that\u2019s consistent with how they have previously operated \u2013 then people have to consider their other options, which is basically taking things to court.\u201d Beyond the cost of offering the assessment and panel services, CBA will not be paying any substantial extra cost than if the advisers had offered the right advice. \u201cHad the advisers behaved in the appropriate way in the first place it wouldn\u2019t have cost us anything, because people would have been put in the right portfolios,\u201d Narev said. \u201cEven people in the right portfolios did suffer a loss in the value of their investments in the global financial crisis, so what this scheme doesn\u2019t do is insulate everybody against what a number of people lost during the global financial crisis.

He said that increasing defensiveness has been replaced with a spirit of openness. \u201cWe\u2019ve heard people tell us that the scheme ought to extend to more people than it does today,\u201d he said. Narev also refused to be drawn on calls for a royal commission into the scandal. \u201cOur view is that \u2026 the program we\u2019re announcing today is the right response,\u201d he said.

The index of commodity prices showed that the price of our exports has fallen 11% since December and they are now back at 2010 levels: This drop means that even though the amount of iron ore and other metals being shipped off to China and other countries is increasing, the amount of money we are getting for these exports is falling \u2013 because the quantity of exports is not rising fast enough to counter the decline in prices. Thus on Wednesday Australia\u2019s balance of payments (the difference between the amount of money we earned from exports over the amount of money spent on imports) showed a deficit of $679m \u2013 down from a surplus of $643m in January. The RBA anticipated this, noting in its statement on Tuesday that while the most recent GDP figures showed strong growth \u201cthis resulted mainly from very strong increases in resource exports as new capacity came on stream; smaller increases in such exports are likely in coming quarters.\u201d We are seeing those smaller increases now.

But this puts the RBA somewhat in conflict with the advice from the BIS which suggested in its latest annual report that central banks should start raising rates. This isn\u2019t all that new from the BIS. As American economist Paul Krugman has noted, the BIS has been calling for higher interest rates for many years \u2013 first to stop inflation, and when that didn\u2019t occur but instead deflation became the concern, it shifted to calling for rate rises because of rising debt levels and because it believes the current record low rates around the world are fuelling easy money and unsafe borrowing by banks. It argues that failing to raise interest rates now \u201cwould exacerbate a country\u2019s vulnerability\u201d to shocks when interest rates are raised later. As economist Richard Green noted rather pithily on Twitter, the BIS is basically arguing that \u201cthe troubling trend of interest rates not rising means that interest rates must be raised lest we face interest rates not rising\u201d. But although tightening monetary policy slows demand in the economy, the BIS also argues that the fiscal side needs to be tightened as well. It argues that \u201cputting the fiscal house in order is paramount; the temptation to stray from this path should be resisted\u201d. So the BIS wants central banks to raise interest rates even though this will stifle economic recovery from the GFC because it wants to stop banks lending irresponsibly in a manner that caused the GFC. And it wants governments to tighten their budgets to help stifle that recovery even more. The RBA, however, is in no rush to take its advice, and one of the main reasons is because our exchange rate remains high despite the fall in export prices. In normal times the exchange rate rises and falls largely in line with our export prices. After January 2012 this occurred, but from the start of this year the value of our dollar has risen while commodity prices have slumped: Were the RBA to raise rates, the dollar would rise even further, not only dampening investment in the economy, but making life even harder for exporters and hinder the ability for the non-mining sector of the economy to grow.
