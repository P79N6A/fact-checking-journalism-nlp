      "bodyText": "Buy-to-let investors have made \u00a312,000 profit on every \u00a31,000 they put into property since mortgages for landlords were first launched in 1996 \u2013 returns that have far outstripped every other type of investment, according to an analysis by one of Britain's biggest lenders. The report by Paragon Mortgages to mark the 18th birthday \u2013 or \"coming of age\" \u2013 of buy to let, predicts that landlords will continue to make an average of 11% a year for the next decade. It found that since 1996, \u00a31,000 invested in a buy-to-let property has turned into \u00a313,048, an annual rate of return of 16.3% a year, buoyed by fast-rising house prices and rents. Over the same period shares would have earned investors 6.8% a year, bonds 6.5% and savings in the bank 4%. The figures have been released as tough new affordability rules for mortgage customers that come into force on Saturday requiring lenders to carry out detailed checks on a borrower's spending and ability to pay if interest rates go up. In recent months first-time buyers have returned in force to the property market, assisted by the government's Help to Buy scheme. But as buy-to-let investors are exempt from the new rules \u2013 they are regarded as businesses rather than homebuyers \u2013 there is concern that lenders may refocus on landlords rather than first time-buyers in the coming months. Chartered surveyors Connells said the new mortgage affordability rules had already had an effect on the housing market, with the total number of property valuations for all purposes falling by 9% in March as lenders began introducing stricter affordability tests. The only area where activity rose over the month was buy to let, it said. One in seven mortgages go to landlords, with lenders having granted 1.5m mortgages worth \u00a3174bn to buy-to-let investors since 1996. Paragon's John Heron said: \"Buy-to-let mortgages have become such an integral part of today's mortgage market that you easily forget that the product didn't exist prior to 1996. The private-rented sector remains an important and growing sector and now represents 18% of the UK's housing market.\" Critics say landlords have elbowed first-time buyers aside, pointing to the fall in home-ownership levels in the UK since their peak a decade ago. In February the English housing survey showed that the proportion of homes lived in by owner-occupiers had fallen to 65.2%, down from 71% in 2003 and at its lowest level since 1987. Alex Hilton, director of Generation Rent, set up to represent Britain's 9 million renters, said: \"While a 16.3% annual profit makes the UK buy-to-let market a hugely lucrative investment for landlords, it's time to count the cost to their captive tenants. It drives up rents and kills the dream of home ownership for millions of tenants, but worse than that, our ComRes poll in March showed that a third of tenants are cutting back on food and two fifths are cutting back on heating \u2013 just so they can pay their rents. \"If retailers hoarded food as a limited resource and profiteered from the consequent price rises, there would be riots on the streets. The buy-to-let market is doing to tenants is having the same effect. People are going hungry so that other people can get rich quick.\" A separate report from Scottish Widows, which examines levels of saving among young adults, has found renters now face a 15-year wait to buy property. The typical private renter is able to save around \u00a32,100 a year, it found, while the average first-time buyer deposit is nearly \u00a331,000. Scottish Widows said 33% of private renters were not putting any money aside and 29% had no savings whatsoever.",

    "webTitle": "RBS bonus plan blocked by government", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "George Osborne is embroiled in a City pay row after plans by Royal Bank of Scotland to hand its bankers bonuses equivalent to 200% of their salaries were blocked. The move means RBS will have to comply with a European Union bonus cap of 100% of annual pay and prompted a warning from the bailed-out bank over the detrimental impact on its operations. Labour accused the chancellor of being in a \"terrible muddle\" over the EU bonus limit, fighting a legal battle to have it declared unlawful while imposing it on the 81%-taxpayer owned bank. A senior Conservative MP, Andrew Tyrie, called for UKFI \u2013 the body that controls the taxpayer stakes in bailed-out banks \u2013 to be scrapped. \"It is difficult to argue that RBS is operating on an arm's length, commercial basis, free from government interference,\" he said. The Edinburgh-based bank spoke of the \"commercial and prudential risk\" to its operations, signalling a potential row with the chancellor after the relationship had thawed following the September appointment of chief executive Ross McEwan. The other big British banks \u2013 including bailed-out Lloyds Banking Group \u2013 are asking their shareholders to back plans to pay out bonuses twice the size of salaries, which is permitted under the bonus cap. RBS, which lost \u00a38.3bn last year, will not put any proposal to a vote at the annual general meeting in June. Osborne denied any ministerial pressure on UKFI in an interview with the BBC but it is believed that the body had originally not been planning to vote against the higher bonus limit. The government is not stopping RBS handing McEwan \u00a31m a year in \"allowances\" \u2013 in effect doubling his salary \u2013 as a route to sidestep the EU bonus cap. Other top bankers at the bailed-out bank \u2013 which handed more than \u00a31m each to 77 of its bankers last year \u2013 will also be handed these allowances, which are also being used by other banks to maintain the size of their top bankers' pay. McEwan will not get the \"allowance\" in 2014 and will no longer receive annual bonuses, a move expected to reduce his pay to a third of his competitors'. His base salary is \u00a31m a year and he receives \u00a340,000 a year in benefits, including the cost of flights to his native New Zealand and a housing allowance. In 2015, RBS will be able to hand him bonuses worth twice his salary, allowance and pension entitlement, which total \u00a32.3m. The chancellor met McEwan and spoke to the chairman, Sir Philip Hampton, on Thursday at the end of a long-running consultation over the loss-making bank's pay policies as business secretary Vince Cable was urging companies to show restraint on top pay. On Friday as RBS published its annual report, it said: \"UKFI has informed the board that it will vote against any resolution which proposes a 2:1 ratio. In these circumstances the board expects such a resolution would fail and it will therefore not be brought to the AGM.\" There was no mention of UKFI's opposition in the prepared statements in the annual report by Penny Hughes, the non-executive director who chairs the remuneration committee. \"Research indicates that 99% of executives in the FTSE 100 at executive committee level or above have a variable to fixed pay ratio that exceeds 1:1,\" she said. \"I know it is not always easy to accept, but if RBS is to thrive we must do what it takes to attract and keep the people who will help us achieve our goals. We think that the right positioning of the business is to be commercial. While we are sensitive to public opinion, particularly given our ownership structure, the ability to pay competitively is fundamental to getting RBS to where we need it to be,\" she said. She was unavailable to elaborate but bBuried in the risk disclosures in the bank's 560 page annual report was a reference to an \"exodus of talented staff\" caused by the bank's changing strategy to restore its profitability after incurring more than \u00a345bn of losses since its 2008 bailout. One shareholder in RBS warned that the bank might now have little option but to increase salaries. A Treasury spokesman welcomed the decision by RBS not to put the bonus cap to a shareholder vote. \"Under the new strategy set out by RBS's chief executive, Ross McEwan, RBS is heading in the right direction, but it has not yet completed its restructuring and remains a majority publicly owned bank. So an increase to the bonus cap cannot be justified and the government made clear it would not have supported such a proposal.\" The government defended its support for bonus plans at Lloyds, where its stake has fallen to below 25%. \"We have made clear: there will be no rise in the bonus cap for an RBS still in recovery; but a bonus cap at Lloyds reflects the progress it has made in getting money back for taxpayers.\" Investors to sue for \u00a31bn Five of Britain's biggest investors are to file lawsuits against Royal Bank of Scotland next week, saying they were misled over its huge cash call in 2008, and claiming more than \u00a31bn. Legal &amp; General \u2013 the biggest investor in RBS at the time of the \u00a312bn rights issue in May 2008 \u2013 and Standard Life, Prudential, Aviva and Universities Superannuation Scheme are expected to file claims on Wednesday. The former RBS boss Fred Goodwin asked shareholders to stump up \u00a312bn to bolster the bank's capital position, which had fallen dangerously low. Lawsuits already filed against RBS over the rights issue also sue Goodwin and ex-RBS chairman Sir Tom McKillop, along with other former executives. RBS is now 81% owned by the government, which had to bail it out. The case is likely to take years to resolve and could cost RBS billions of pounds in compensation. It could also result in Goodwin having to appear in court as the bank's key witness. RBS said it would defend the claims. Reuters",

Other top bankers at the bailed-out bank \u2013 which handed more than \u00a31m each to 77 of its bankers last year \u2013 will also be handed these allowances, which are also being used by other banks to maintain the size of their top bankers' pay.</p> <p>McEwan will not get the \"allowance\" in 2014 and will no longer receive annual bonuses, a move expected to reduce his pay to a third of his competitors'. His base salary is \u00a31m a year and he receives \u00a340,000 a year in benefits, including the cost of flights to his native New Zealand and a housing allowance. In 2015, RBS will be able to hand him bonuses worth twice his salary, allowance and pension entitlement, which total \u00a32.3m.</p> <p>The chancellor met McEwan and spoke to the chairman, Sir Philip Hampton, on Thursday at the end of a long-running consultation over the loss-making bank's pay policies as business secretary Vince Cable was urging companies to show restraint on top pay.</p> <p>On Friday as RBS <a href=\"http://www.investors.rbs.com/~/media/Files/R/RBS-IR/2013-reports/annual-report-and-accounts-2013.pdf\" title=\"\">published its annual report</a>, it said: \"UKFI has informed the board that it will vote against any resolution which proposes a 2:1 ratio. In these circumstances the board expects such a resolution would fail and it will therefore not be brought to the AGM.\"</p> <p>There was no mention of UKFI's opposition in the prepared statements in the annual report by Penny Hughes, the non-executive director who chairs the remuneration committee. \"Research indicates that 99% of executives in the FTSE 100 at executive committee level or above have a variable to fixed pay ratio that exceeds 1:1,\" she said.</p> <p>\"I know it is not always easy to accept, but if RBS is to thrive we must do what it takes to attract and keep the people who will help us achieve our goals. We think that the right positioning of the business is to be commercial. While we are sensitive to public opinion, particularly given our ownership structure, the ability to pay competitively is fundamental to getting RBS to where we need it to be,\" she said.</p> <p>She was unavailable to elaborate but bBuried in the risk disclosures in the bank's 560 page annual report was a reference to an \"exodus of talented staff\" caused by the bank's changing strategy to restore its profitability after incurring more than \u00a345bn of losses since its 2008 bailout.</p> <p>One shareholder in RBS warned that the bank might now have little option but to increase salaries.</p> <p>A Treasury spokesman welcomed the decision by RBS not to put the bonus cap to a shareholder vote. \"Under the new strategy set out by RBS's chief executive, Ross McEwan, RBS is heading in the right direction, but it has not yet completed its restructuring and remains a majority publicly owned bank. So an increase to the bonus cap cannot be justified and the government made clear it would not have supported such a proposal.\"</p> <p>The government defended its support for bonus plans at Lloyds, where its stake has fallen to below 25%. \"We have made clear: there will be no rise in the bonus cap for an RBS still in recovery; but a bonus cap at Lloyds reflects the progress it has made in getting money back for taxpayers.\"</p> <h2><strong>Investors to sue for \u00a31bn</strong></h2> <p>Five of Britain's biggest investors are to file lawsuits against Royal Bank of Scotland next week, saying they were misled over its huge cash call in 2008, and claiming more than \u00a31bn.</p> <p>Legal &amp; General \u2013 the biggest investor in RBS at the time of the \u00a312bn rights issue in May 2008 \u2013 and Standard Life, Prudential, Aviva and Universities Superannuation Scheme are expected to file claims on Wednesday.</p> <p>The former RBS boss Fred Goodwin asked shareholders to stump up \u00a312bn to bolster the bank's capital position, which had fallen dangerously low. Lawsuits already filed against RBS over the rights issue also sue Goodwin and ex-RBS chairman Sir Tom McKillop, along with other former executives.</p> <p>RBS is now 81% owned by the government, which had to bail it out.</p> <p>The case is likely to take years to resolve and could cost RBS billions of pounds in compensation. It could also result in Goodwin having to appear in court as the bank's key witness. RBS said it would defend the claims.</p> <p><strong>Reuters</strong></p>",

The policy vote was introduced by business secretary Vince Cable \u2013 who this week called on companies to show pay restraint \u2013 and is to ratify pay deals for the coming three years.</p> <p>\"We acknowledge the basis of this objection. We have already addressed this issue in our new remuneration policy, which has received the support of 96% of our shareholders,\" Moreno said.</p> <p>Earlier last month, David Arculus, the non-executive director who chairs the remuneration committee, had issued <a href=\"http://www.investegate.co.uk/pearson-plc--pson-/rns/further-information-re-remuneration-policy/201404090909264160E/\" title=\"\">a clarification to the remuneration policy</a> after consultations with major shareholders.</p> <p>The clarification related to discretion used by the remuneration committee to pay its directors.</p> <p>Pearson<a href=\"http://www.investegate.co.uk/pearson-plc--pson-/rns/agm-statement/201404250703225149F/\" title=\"\"> issued a trading update</a> alongside its AGM which showed a 6% fall in sales in the first quarter of 2014, which is blamed on the strength of sterling on the foreign exchange markets. If those currency movements are stripped out \u2013 Pearson generates 60% of its sales in the US \u2013 sales were up 2%.</p> <p>John Fallon, who succeeded Scardino, said: \"Pearson has had a solid start to the year, in line with our expectations.

A contender for the chief executive role when Dame Marjorie Scardino retired, Fairhead left the following April. At the time of her resignation the company said that it had decided she was leaving as \"a consequence of the planned incorporation of the professional education division overseen by Rona into other parts of Pearson's education business, coupled with the smaller size of the Financial Times Group owing to recent major divestments\". The annual report for 2013 shows she received \u00a3347,000 before she left. At Friday's annual meeting, Pearson's chairman Glen Moreno acknowledged the scale of the votes against the remuneration report. Some 34% of investors voted against the report, a level of dissent which rises to 36% if deliberate abstentions are included. \"The vote on our remuneration report for last year was heavily influenced by objections \u2013 primarily from a proxy agency \u2013 to a specific share award, which was part of a negotiated settlement with a departing director more than a year ago,\" Moreno said. He said that remuneration policy, which all companies are putting to a vote for the first time this year, had been more enthusiastically endorsed. The policy vote was introduced by business secretary Vince Cable \u2013 who this week called on companies to show pay restraint \u2013 and is to ratify pay deals for the coming three years. \"We acknowledge the basis of this objection. We have already addressed this issue in our new remuneration policy, which has received the support of 96% of our shareholders,\" Moreno said. Earlier last month, David Arculus, the non-executive director who chairs the remuneration committee, had issued a clarification to the remuneration policy after consultations with major shareholders. The clarification related to discretion used by the remuneration committee to pay its directors. Pearson issued a trading update alongside its AGM which showed a 6% fall in sales in the first quarter of 2014, which is blamed on the strength of sterling on the foreign exchange markets. If those currency movements are stripped out \u2013 Pearson generates 60% of its sales in the US \u2013 sales were up 2%. John Fallon, who succeeded Scardino, said: \"Pearson has had a solid start to the year, in line with our expectations. Our major programme of restructuring and investment is on track and will drive a leaner, more cash generative, faster growing business from 2015.\" Pearson is focusing on education publishing after selling 53% of its stake in publisher Penguin.",

The average issuing yield was 1.6% in the first quarter of 2014, a historical low. </p> <p>- Contingent fiscal risks from the financial sector have declined as larger Italian banks took advantage of improved market conditions to strengthen capital ahead of the ECB's comprehensive asset quality review and some \u20ac10bn new share issues have been announced to date. Debt issuance of Italian banks in the first quarter of 2014 was markedly higher compared with the previous year.</p> <p>- Italy had a current account surplus in 2013, the first time since the financial crisis. Fitch expects the surplus to widen in 2014, driven by stronger export demand, not least from eurozone partners, while imports will remain subdued due to the weakness of domestic demand.</p> </blockquote> <p>As for Spain, Fitch upgraded the country's issuer default ratings to BBB+ from BBB, with a stable outlook. The main reasons:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>- Risks to Spain's creditworthiness have decreased since the sovereign was downgraded to BBB in June 2012. Financing conditions have improved, the economic outlook is more certain, and the risk of Spanish banks posing an additional burden on the sovereign has diminished.</p> <p>-Spain's fiscal track record over the past two years has been strong, in our opinion. Its headline fiscal deficit (excluding bank support) declined by 2.5% of GDP in 2012-13, despite a 2.2% drop in nominal GDP over the same period.</p> </blockquote> <p>The full reports are here:</p> <h2><a href=\"https://www.fitchratings.com/creditdesk/press_releases/detail.cfm?pr_id=827722&amp;cm_sp=homepage-_-Featured_Content_Archive-_-Fitch%20Revises%20Italy%27s%20Outlook%20to%20Stable,%20Affirms%20at%20%27BBB+%27\">Fitch Revises Italy's Outlook to Stable, Affirms at 'BBB+'</a></h2> <h2><a href=\"https://www.fitchratings.com/creditdesk/press_releases/detail.cfm?pr_id=827770\">Fitch Upgrades Spain to 'BBB+'; Outlook Stable</a></h2> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2014-04-25T15:54:09.326Z\">at 4.54pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-535a7546e4b0d109ef803173\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2014-04-25T14:49:10.867Z\">3.49pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><b>Andrew Tyrie, chair of the Treasury committee, has criticised <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/blog/2014/apr/25/markets-wobble-on-ukraine-tensions-live?view=desktop#block-535a4f2de4b0a4da67f0964c\">the government's move to block bonuses at Royal Bank of Scotland</a>, apparently going against the plans of UKFI which holds the taxpayers' stake in the bank.</b> Tyrie said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The Banking Commission concluded that UKFI would increasingly be perceived as a fig leaf to disguise direct Government control of RBS.

A survey from Markit Economics found that only 41% of households expect the Bank of England to start raising rates within the next year, down from 46% in March. And only 7% of households expect rates to rise within the next three months, the lowest proportion since October.</p> <p><b>Chris Williamson chief economist at Markit,</b>thinks this means that<b> </b>BoE's forward guidance policy is working successfully. </p> <p>The bank had promised not to raise interest rates until unemployment fell to 7%. But a faster than expected fall in the jobless rate saw the bank revise the guidance by introducing a broader set of economic yardsticks. These more technical yardsticks opened the bank to criticism that it was less forward guidance, more <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/economics-blog/2014/feb/12/bank-of-england-inflation-report-forward-guidance\">fuzzy guidance</a>.</p> <p>Here is Chris Williamson's view:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The lower rate hike expectations follow the Bank\u2019s decision to revise its forward guidance at the publication of its last Inflation Report, and its concerted efforts to reassure households and businesses rates are not likely to rise until at least 2015, and that even then rate rises will be gradual. </p> <p>Given the speed with which unemployment has fallen, now down to 6.9% compared to 7.8% last June, and recent upward revisions to the UK economic outlook (including the IMF\u2019s upgrading, which sees the UK growing faster than all other G7 countries this year), the lower interest rate expectations can be seen as a sign that forward guidance is working successfully. However, the fact that inflation also continues to fall, down now to 1.6% and well below the Bank\u2019s 2.0% target, will have no doubt also contributed to the lowering of rate hike views.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-535a4f2de4b0a4da67f0964c\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2014-04-25T12:12:45.330Z\">1.12pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/apr/25/royal-bank-of-scotland-bonus-plan-blocked-by-government\">More details are emerging about how RBS bankers lost their super-bonuses</a>.</p> <p><b>Jill Treanor</b> reports that the veto on the RBS bonus plan came directly from George Osborne.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The chancellor, who has made clear he is opposed to the EU's bonus cap, met the bank's boss and spoke to the chairman, Sir Philip Hampton, on Thursday at the end of a long-running consultation over the loss-making bank's pay policies. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/georgeosborne\">George Osborne</a>'s decision to block the plans also demonstrated tensions between politicians and UKFI which, it is believed, had not intended to object to the plan.</p> </blockquote> <p>So is it all a terrible muddle - as Labour says.

With the geopolitical uncertainty, investors decided to cash in some of their profits ahead of the weekend. So the final scores showed: \u2022 The FTSE 100 finished down 17.31 points or 0.26% at 6685.69 \u2022 Germany's Dax was down 1.54% at 9401.55 \u2022 France's Cac closed 0.8% lower at 4443.63 \u2022 Italy's FTSE MIB ended 1.73% down at 21,441.57 \u2022 Spain's Ibex fell 1.49% to 10,306.2 In the US, Wall Street is currently down 108 points or 0.66%. On that note, it's time to close up for the week. Thanks for all your comments, and have a good weekend. We'll be back on Monday. Positive news for both Italy and Spain from ratings agency Fitch. It has revised Italy's outlook to stable from negative and affirmed its long-term issuer default ratings at BBB+. The agency said the move came because: -The deep and prolonged recession of the Italian economy ended in the second half of 2013, in line with Fitch's previous forecasts. - The Italian sovereign has benefited from a significant improvement in financing conditions since mid-2012. The average issuing yield was 1.6% in the first quarter of 2014, a historical low. - Contingent fiscal risks from the financial sector have declined as larger Italian banks took advantage of improved market conditions to strengthen capital ahead of the ECB's comprehensive asset quality review and some \u20ac10bn new share issues have been announced to date. Debt issuance of Italian banks in the first quarter of 2014 was markedly higher compared with the previous year. - Italy had a current account surplus in 2013, the first time since the financial crisis. Fitch expects the surplus to widen in 2014, driven by stronger export demand, not least from eurozone partners, while imports will remain subdued due to the weakness of domestic demand. As for Spain, Fitch upgraded the country's issuer default ratings to BBB+ from BBB, with a stable outlook. The main reasons: - Risks to Spain's creditworthiness have decreased since the sovereign was downgraded to BBB in June 2012. Financing conditions have improved, the economic outlook is more certain, and the risk of Spanish banks posing an additional burden on the sovereign has diminished. -Spain's fiscal track record over the past two years has been strong, in our opinion. Its headline fiscal deficit (excluding bank support) declined by 2.5% of GDP in 2012-13, despite a 2.2% drop in nominal GDP over the same period. The full reports are here: Fitch Revises Italy's Outlook to Stable, Affirms at 'BBB+' Fitch Upgrades Spain to 'BBB+'; Outlook Stable Andrew Tyrie, chair of the Treasury committee, has criticised the government's move to block bonuses at Royal Bank of Scotland, apparently going against the plans of UKFI which holds the taxpayers' stake in the bank. Tyrie said: The Banking Commission concluded that UKFI would increasingly be perceived as a fig leaf to disguise direct Government control of RBS. Today\u2019s events appear to confirm this. It is difficult to argue that RBS is operating on an arms length, commercial basis, free from Government interference. Well structured bonuses can incentivise better performance and behaviour. It is essential that bankers receive rewards only when it is clear that they have been earned. The Banking Commission also concluded that a bonus cap was not the answer. Bonus caps create upward pressure on base salaries, increasing the fixed-cost base. Fundamental reform of the bonus culture is needed - including much longer deferral and much greater scope for pay to be recovered in appropriate circumstances. Further signs of a more buoyant economy in the US with consumer confidence hitting a nine month high in April. Ahead of next week's US Federal Reserve meeting - when further \u00a210bn tapering of the central bank's bond buying programme is expected - the Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan consumer sentiment index came in at 84.1 this month. This is up from 80 in March and better than the 83 forecast by economists and the preliminary reading of 82.6. Annalisa Piazza at Newedge Strategy said: Consumer confidence is now running at its fastest pace since July 2013 and the negative effects of adverse weather conditions over the winter months seem to be well behind us. Expectations for an improved economic outlook have been the key driver of the slight upward correction. The solid upswing in the current conditions index is quite encouraging, given the pressure from higher food and fuel prices over the month, coupled with higher mortgage and credit rates that somehow limit the upside in households\u2019 buying conditions. All in all, today's consumer confidence survey is rather upbeat, signalling a solid rebound in sentiment as US households are well supported by an improved labour market and prospects of increasing disposable income. Cyprus is the latest country to get a gold star from credit rating agency Standard &amp; Poor's. The agency upgraded the country's rating by one notch to B and said the outlook remained positive. In a separate move rating agency Fitch revised its outlook for Cyprus from stable to negative. S&amp;P said the Cypriot economy hadn't shrunk as much as anticipated and that the government is meeting all the fiscal targets set out in its bailout deal with other eurozone countries and the International Monetary Fund. Cypriot President Nicos Anastasiades said the development provided fresh confirmation that the country is \"on the right path\" even though much work remains to be done. Via AP agency On that note I am handing over the blog to Nick Fletcher - thank you for following so far. More troubles for the Royal Bank of Scotland on top of the bonus row. Reuters has reported that three of the UK's largest investors will file a lawsuit against Royal Bank of Scotland next week in a bid to claw back \u00a31bn. The three investors are Legal &amp; General, Standard Life and M&amp;G Investment. They have accused the bank of misleading them over a 2008 rights issue and are expected to file a claim in a London court on Wednesday. From Reuters RBS raised 12 billion pounds from a record rights issue in May 2008 to bolster its capital position, which had fallen dangerously low after the bank bought parts of ABN Amro and lost billions on U.S. credit market assets. The bank was subsequently rescued by the government, which now owns 81 percent. The three insurers invested up to \u00a31.2 bn in the rights issue, according to Reuters calculations based on their shareholdings at the time. RBS said it would defend the claims: \"While RBS and its former directors made some business decisions that have been criticised, this does not mean that they misled investors or acted illegally. Vive la diff\u00e9rence? France's economy minister, Arnaud Montebourg has been expressing his \"patriotic concern\" about a possible takeover of French national champion Alstom by the US conglomeration GE. Across the channel, George Osborne sounds relaxed about one of the UK's largest pharmaceutical firms, AstraZeneca, falling into the hands of US Pfizer. Asked for his view on the $100bn bid from Pfizer, Osborne said it was \"commercial matter\". I note that AstraZeneca has not put out any market statement, which is something people's attention should be drawn to, but I don't think I should comment further on that commercial matter Portugal is remembering the Carnation Revolution - the 40th anniversary of a nearly-bloodless coup that ended half a century of authoritarian rule. People are already gathering in the capital to recall the day in 1974 when army tanks swept into Lisbon. But many Portuguese people now believe that the social and economic achievements the revolution ushered in are now under threat. The FT's Lisbon correspondent Peter Wise says the country is not in a mood to celebrate with unemployment high and sharp reductions in family income (metred paywall). Critics also accuse the centre-right government of using the bailout as a pretext for advancing its own \u201cneoliberal\u201d agenda for eroding the welfare state and narrowing universal access to state-funded healthcare and education, seen as two of the key \u201cconquests\u201d of the 1974 revolution. \u201cAll the social achievements of the revolution \u2013 the national health service, education, pensions \u2013 are under threat from austerity policies,\u201d says Vasco Louren\u00e7o, one of the young captains who led the 1974 coup, now a portly 71-year-old, but no less radical. British bank executives are used to hearing some colourful language from small shareholders - one told Barclays bosses yesterday they were paying for Manchester United, but getting Colchester United. But big City investors, who hold most of the shares, tend to be use less colourful language. So when a major institutional shareholder, albeit anonymous, says bankers have \"made out like bandits\" it is worth paying attention. Here is what the \"major institutional shareholder in Barclays and RBS\" told Reuters. We want banks to be run for the shareholders and not for the staff. It's a difficult balance but it's certainly not right at the moment. Think what a miserable experience being a bank shareholder has been over the last few years whereas the staff have made out like bandits. Maybe the climate is such at the moment that people are prepared to wear a bit more political intervention. The message from former MPC member, Andrew Sentance, that interest rates should start rising soon ought be ringing in the ears of anyone with a non-fixed mortgage. But households are increasingly less likely to share this view. A survey from Markit Economics found that only 41% of households expect the Bank of England to start raising rates within the next year, down from 46% in March. And only 7% of households expect rates to rise within the next three months, the lowest proportion since October. Chris Williamson chief economist at Markit,thinks this means that BoE's forward guidance policy is working successfully. The bank had promised not to raise interest rates until unemployment fell to 7%. But a faster than expected fall in the jobless rate saw the bank revise the guidance by introducing a broader set of economic yardsticks. These more technical yardsticks opened the bank to criticism that it was less forward guidance, more fuzzy guidance. Here is Chris Williamson's view: The lower rate hike expectations follow the Bank\u2019s decision to revise its forward guidance at the publication of its last Inflation Report, and its concerted efforts to reassure households and businesses rates are not likely to rise until at least 2015, and that even then rate rises will be gradual. Given the speed with which unemployment has fallen, now down to 6.9% compared to 7.8% last June, and recent upward revisions to the UK economic outlook (including the IMF\u2019s upgrading, which sees the UK growing faster than all other G7 countries this year), the lower interest rate expectations can be seen as a sign that forward guidance is working successfully. However, the fact that inflation also continues to fall, down now to 1.6% and well below the Bank\u2019s 2.0% target, will have no doubt also contributed to the lowering of rate hike views. More details are emerging about how RBS bankers lost their super-bonuses. Jill Treanor reports that the veto on the RBS bonus plan came directly from George Osborne. The chancellor, who has made clear he is opposed to the EU's bonus cap, met the bank's boss and spoke to the chairman, Sir Philip Hampton, on Thursday at the end of a long-running consultation over the loss-making bank's pay policies. George Osborne's decision to block the plans also demonstrated tensions between politicians and UKFI which, it is believed, had not intended to object to the plan. So is it all a terrible muddle - as Labour says. Or, as one of our readers argues, no inconsistency at all, given that the government is the largest shareholder in RBS. The reverberations of the Ukraine crisis continue for Russia's economy: its central bank has raised interest rates by 50 basis points to 7.5% The unexpected move follows a 150 bps raise in March. The central bank said its decision was due to inflationary risks caused by the weakening rouble. The probability of inflation exceeding the 5% target at the end of 2014 has increased substantially. This has been caused by more pronounced than expected pass-through effect of the exchange rate dynamics on consumer prices. Although the rouble initially improved its position it is now climbing against the dollar - see this handy chart from Joe Weisenthal at Business Insider. Greece's economy is set to return to economic growth this year, but the country will continue to rely on international creditors for some years to come. This is the message of a report from the European Commission released today - with the snappy title: The Second Economic Adjustment Programme for Greece \u2013 Fourth Review - April 2014 The report is well over 200 pages long so I've culled some highlights from the expert watchers in Athens and Brussels. Reuters highlights that Greece's debts are forecast to fall more slowly than expected: debt as a percentage of GDP will stand at 112% in 2020, far off an earlier forecast that it would fall \"substantially below\" 110%. Income from selling off state assets will come un \u20ac1.9bn lower than expected at around \u20ac22.3bn by 2020. Reporters also highlight the funding gap, which will mean Greece will have \u20ac5.5bn less than it needs in 2015. Matina Stevis of the Wall Street Journal highlights the ongoing social cost As market watchers feared, uncertainty over Ukraine is weighing on European stock prices. All the main indices have fallen, with Germany's DAX leading the way. Dax -0.9% at 9,472 points CAC -0.3% at 4,464 points FTSE100 -0.22% at 6690 points Meanwhile, the price of a barrel of Brent crude oil is close to $110, just off seven-week highs. Carsten Fritsch, a senior oil and commodities analyst at Commerzbank in Frankfurt, said the escalation of the crisis in eastern Ukraine could affect energy supplies. If the standoff intensifies, energy supplies could be hit either by sanctions or by incidents such as pipeline blockages or even attacks on oil or gas facilities. Via Reuters\ufeff RBS shares are up 0.36% - so are investors not worried about 'commercial risks' of RBS not being able to retain its 'top talent? Labour has slammed the government for getting in \"a terrible muddle\" over bankers' bonuses. Here is shadow Treasury minister Cathy Jamieson on the government's response to RBS bonuses. George Osborne is in a terrible muddle over bankers' bonuses. He is spending taxpayer's money on a legal fight in Brussels against the bonus cap and yet imposing the minimum cap at RBS. The Government has bowed to pressure on RBS and finally admitted that bonuses of two times salary would be unacceptable at what remains a bank in government ownership. They voted against Labour's motion to impose the minimum cap at RBS in January, but have now been forced to reverse their position. But confusingly at the same time the Chancellor is supporting higher bonuses in Lloyds Bank and elsewhere. People who are facing a cost-of-living crisis are rightly angry about excessive rewards for failure in banking over recent years. The Chancellor should accept the logic of today's announcement and drop his legal action to block the bonus cap. But the director of the High Pay Centre, Deborah Hargreaves, fault Labour for not tackling bonuses when it had the chance. It was unfortunate that the previous government did not take the opportunity to reform bonuses when the bank was first taken into public ownership. The toxic pay culture in banking prevents banks from winning the public trust they need to thrive in the long-term. Now the government must make sure RBS do not attempt to find ways around this cap \u2013 there is little evidence to suggest that multi-million pound pay packages are necessary to recruit so-called top talent. Instead, Banks should focus on training up their existing staff and finding ways of recognising good performance other than obscene bonus payments. The surprise news that retail sales figures eked out 0.1% growth in March is seen as good news for retailers and the UK economy. Here is a round-up of comment: Keith Richardson at Lloyds Bank's commercial banking arm, says retailers will be heartened by the figures. The sector continues to benefit from positive sentiment based around consumers\u2019 willingness to keep spending. The arrival of warm summer weather and Mother's Day also helped retailers drive sales in March. Non-food retailers such as furniture and DIY specialists were amongst the best performers as the consumer recovery and continued upturn in the housing market boosted sales. Clothing and footwear retailers, aided by the arrival of warm spring weather, recovered from the previous month's poor results. The effects of price cuts in the grocery sector have yet to be fully realised. Once these take hold it will be interesting to see if this growth can be sustained in the long run. Jeremy Cook, chief economist at World First, is forecasting growth of 0.8% for the first quarter of 2014. Increased confidence around the breadth and scale of the UK recovery has combined with the first rise in \u2018real wages\u2019 in 5 years and a significant wealth effect on house price increases to push the UK retail sector onward in March. Thoughts had been that consumers would take a slight pause in March from retail \u2013 a breather before the late Easter spending spree \u2013 but sales of clothing increased by 3.1% on the month and took the overall average into positive territory. Howard Archer, chief UK economist at IHS, describes the figures as impressive after a late Easter delayed consumer spending. Even so, given that consumers have faced a prolonged squeeze on their purchasing power, the ability and willingness of many people is likely to remain limited for some time to come. The encouraging prospect for retailers - and for overall growth prospects - is that consumers\u2019 purchasing power should pick up over the coming months with inflation remaining muted and earnings growth strengthening, albeit likely relatively gradually. A political storm is brewing in France over the future of engineering giant Alstom, following reports of a takeover bid from US conglomerate General Electric. France's economy minister Arnaud Montebourg voiced the government's \"patriotic concern\" about the possible loss of the French turbine and train maker. In an interview with Le Monde he said Alstom is the symbol of our industrial power and French ingenuity. The government expresses patriotic concern and watchfulness with regard to Alstom. This high concern is focused on the serious risk of losing a major decision centre, on the desire and the necessity of reinforcing our industrial base.... This is why the government is working on other solutions and contingencies than those forseen - and without having been informed by Alstom. France's stock market regulator has suspended Alstom shares this morning pending an announcement from the company. Meanwhile the president of General Electric has been summoned to meet prime minister Manuel Valls. The Guardian's Gwyn Topham has the background on how the takeover bid came about. Alstom's energy businesses \u2013 which include building coal, gas and nuclear plants, as well as power grids \u2013 accounted for more than 70% of its \u20ac20bn (\u00a316.5bn) global revenues last year, but the unit has struggled as Europe's economic weakness led to a slump in orders. The group announced last year it would cut 1,300 jobs and put assets up for sale, including a minority stake in its transport business. By most people's standards 0.1% growth is not a lot, but this unexpected lift in sales underscores that the UK consumer is still spending. Here are more details from the Office for National Statistics - full release here. Retail sales rose 0.1% in March, compared to 1.7% in February. This puts sales 4.2% ahead compared with March 2013. Non-food stores saw the highest year-on-year increase (9.6%) since April 2002. The ONS thinks this is a reflection of last year's unseasonably cold March when freezing temperatures kept shoppers at home. It was a different story in food stores, which saw the largest year-on-year decrease (2.3%) since April 2013. Sales figures also confirmed a deflationary trend: the average prices of goods sold in March 2014 was 0.5% lower with the cost of fuel falling by 5.8%. Online sales continue to surge ahead. The amount spent online increased by 7.1% in March 2014 compared with the previous year. Breaking news: UK retail sales rose by 0.1% in March, surprising analysts who had forecast a 1.4% fall. Another warning on house prices from a former member of the Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee. Andrew Sentance told theBBC Radio 4 Today programme that homeowners will struggle if rates do not rise steadily. We are getting near the point where we should be seeing a gradual rise in interest rates. A smidgeon of good news for President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, as the Standard &amp; Poor's rating agency upheld its AA rating for France and forecast an upturn in growth. S&amp;P has pencilled in average GDP growth of 1.3% in 2014-17, against an average of 1% in 2010-13. We anticipate that exports will pick up, supported by the steady demand in the euro area. We project that private-sector spending, in particular investment spending, may gradually replace public-sector consumption as the key economic growth driver, given the improved lending conditions for banks and the generally moderate private-sector leverage by standards in advanced economies. However, there was a sting in the tail although we view positively the measures introduced in 2013 to ease labor costs and which are about to be reinforced through the Responsibility Pact announced early this year, they may not be enough to fuel employment growth. We continue to see a substantial output gap and a still-high non-wage cost of employment. The (partial) validation on the government plan comes two days after the government announced a delay in reaching its deficit-reduction target. But although Hollande has abandoned a plan to balance the books by 2017, the government is still on course for deep spending cuts: \u20ac21 billion in 2015, \u20ac16 billion in 2016 and \u20ac13 billion in 2017. In a week when bankers' conducts is back in the headlines, here is a lovely letter from today's FT. If there\u2019s one lesson I\u2019ve learnt from several years of reading these salmon-pink pages, it\u2019s that the era of Dawes Tomes Mousely Grubbs Fidelity Fiduciary Bank and the like is long over. I don\u2019t exactly keep my tuppence under the mattress yet, but I\u2009wouldn\u2019t\u2009fault\u2009others\u2009for\u2009considering that a more prudent approach. State-backed Lloyds Bank will get away with its plan to side-step the bonus cap. The government has been selling off its holdings: the taxpayer owns 24.9% of Lloyds down from the original 39% it took on at the height of the financial crisis. Here is the full story on RBS pay from the Guardian's City editor Jill Treanor. Despite the government restrictions, RBS boss Ross McEwan will take home an extra \u00a31m a year to get round the EU bonus cap. RBS bonus plan blocked by government The government decision on RBS is especially interesting, as the idea of the bonus cap came from the European Union. The Treasury opposed the idea and filed a complaint at the European Court of Justice, while arguing that the bonus cap would make banks more risky. Simon Nixon at the Wall Street Journal points out the inconsistency. Another skirmish in the long-running battle over bankers' pay, as the government overrules RBS's plan to award their bankers a bonus twice as large as their salary. The RBS board isn't happy, but UKFI, the body that manages the taxpayer's 81% stake, clearly left them no choice. Here is the statement (my highlights): ...all of our major competitors in the UK and Europe have indicated that they will seek approval from their shareholders to award variable remuneration up to 200% of fixed pay i.e. a 2:1 ratio. The Board believes the best commercial solution for RBS is to have the flexibility on variable to fixed pay ratios that is now emerging as the sector norm. This would also allow RBS to maintain the maximum amount of compensation that could be subject to performance conditions including claw back for conduct issues that may emerge in future. This position was understood during consultation with institutional shareholders. UKFI has informed the Board that it will vote against any resolution which proposes a 2:1 ratio. In these circumstances the Board expects such a resolution would fail and will therefore not be brought to the AGM. The Board acknowledges that this outcome creates a commercial and prudential risk which it must try to mitigate within the framework of a 1:1 fixed to variable compensation ratio. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and the business world. Asian markets have fallen against a backdrop of escalating tensions over Ukraine, following a warning from US Secretary of State John Kerry that Washington was ready to impose further sanctions on Russia. Kerry accused Russia of trying to destablise eastern Ukraine ahead of next month's elections and told Moscow that escalating the crisis would be \"an expensive mistake\". Almost on cue, credit ratings agency Standard &amp; Poors announced this morning that it had cut Russia's credit rating to BBB- just one notch above junk. S&amp;P said: The tense geopolitical situation between Russia and Ukraine could see additional significant outflows of both foreign and domestic capital from the Russian economy and hence further undermine already weakening growth prospects. Bloomberg has reported that two Russian state banks, Vnesheconombank and Gazprombank are readying themselves for sanctions. In Asia, early gains on stock markets were wiped out as investors took stock of the crisis. The MSCI index of Asia Pacific shares (excluding Japan) was down 0.8%, Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng index has fallen 1.3% and the Shanghai Composite Index is down 0.3%. However, Japan\u2019s Nikkei index ticked up 0.17%, after data showed the biggest rise in inflation numbers since 1992. Analysts are expecting a day of volatile trading in Europe. Here in the UK, there is plenty to keep us interested. RBS, which is 81%-owned by the taxpayer, has bowed to government pressure not to pay out bonuses twice the size of salaries. But 75 people have been paid more than \u00a31m. More on that soon\u2026 At 9.30 we are expecting retail sales data: analysts are expecting a 0.4% dip in sales for March, after a consumers hit the shops with unexpected energy in February. I'll be tracking that and all the latest...",

The tech company, Quindell, declined to elaborate on the nature of the legal action on Friday but had said earlier that Gotham City's comments were \"highly defamatory\" and \"deliberately misrepresentative\". The company said short positions were taken in its shares prior to the publication of the report. Short positions involve investors borrowing shares and then selling them, expecting the price to fall so they can buy the shares back, return them to the lender, pay borrowing fees and pocket the difference. US-based Gotham City Research has not said whether it has taken a short position on Quindell's shares, but says on its website that it may have long or short positions in the companies it covers. Gotham City Research, which does not list a telephone number on its website, did not respond to a request for comment by Reuters posted on the \"contact us\" section of its website. Quindell's shares initially fell as much as 20% after it said it had initiated the legal action but recovered later when the company published a detailed response to Gotham City Research's allegations on its website. The AIM-listed company said its response should reassure investors about its \"transparent approach\". Almost 1.9bn Quindell shares had traded by 12:40 GMT, when the stock was up 5% at 26.25p.

      "bodyText": "George Osborne declined to rally to AstraZeneca's defence against foreign takeover interest on Friday, despite reports that Britain's second-largest pharmaceutical group is the subject of a \u00a360bn approach from American rival Pfizer. The chancellor's arm's-length stance contrasted with that of the French government, which expressed \"patriotic concern\" as shares in the industrial group Alstom were suspended following reports that US conglomerate General Electric was in talks over a $13bn (\u00a37.7bn) acquisition. Asked about AstraZeneca after delivering a speech on the economic importance of Britain's science base in Cambridge, Osborne said the reports were speculative and declined to comment on any possible government involvement. \"It's a commercial matter between the companies,\" the chancellor said. \"I note that AstraZeneca has not put out any market statement, which is something people's attention should be drawn to, but I don't think I should comment further on that commercial matter.\" Acquiring AstraZeneca would be the biggest ever foreign takeover of a British company and the suggested deal has triggered worries about jobs in Britain's pharmaceuticals sector, which is viewed as a key industry by the government. The healthcare sector is in the middle of a wave of deal-making, with Novartis and GlaxoSmithKline this week agreeing to trade more than $20bn worth of assets and Zimmer agreeing to buy rival orthopaedic products maker Biomet for $13bn, while reports on Friday claimed Ireland's Shire had received a takeover approach in recent months from Botox maker Allergan. The French government was drawing up defensive lines over the threatened acquisition of Alstom, as GE reportedly prepared to buy some or all of the industrial group, which manufactures TGV trains and builds energy plants and equipment. The economy minister, Arnaud Montebourg, said the government was concerned about Alstom's future, calling it \"the symbol of our industrial power and French ingenuity\". Montebourg told Le Monde: \"The government expresses patriotic concern and watchfulness with regard to Alstom. This concern is focused on the serious risk of losing a major decision centre. \" \"With the prime minister [Manuel Valls], we will meet the president of General Electric in order to focus our talks on these concerns.\" He said he had met Alstom's chief executive, Patrick Kron, on Thursday. Earlier on Friday, Kron confirmed to union representatives that there were talks about an \"industrial deal\", but did not name GE. The importance of Alstom to France saw it bailed out by the state during previous difficulties in 2004. The group employs 18,000 people in France and 93,000 worldwide. Alstom has declined to comment on takeover speculation beyond a statement that it was \"not informed of any potential public tender offer for the shares of the company\". Shares in Alstom rose 11% on Thursday in anticipation of an offer. Its energy businesses \u2013 including building fossil fuel plants and nuclear reactors, as well as maintaining power grids \u2013 make up the bulk of its revenues, but it has struggled to fill order books in recent downturns. Last year Alstom said it would cut 1,300 jobs and sell a minority stake in its transport arm, which includes making high speed trains and building and maintaining rail and metro fleets. GE is believed to be most interested in Alstom's energy infrastructure. The US group, ranked the fourth biggest conglomerate in the world by Forbes, has similar heavy involvement in building plants and power worldwide \u2013 including designing the Fukushima nuclear reactor, with a range of divisions spanning engineering, transport, healthcare and finance. French industrial group Bouygues, Alstom's biggest shareholder, is thought to back a sale to GE.",

Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Creating a happy and productive workforce would be a dream come true for many business owners, but Britain's SMEs are getting better at it. There's a growing realisation among many entrepreneurs that they aren't always the best managers and might need a little help. Higher productivity can be achieved without crushing the morale of employees; some businesses use trainers and mentors, others create intelligent systems, while some opt to build an inspiring workspace. Here, three businesses share their methods:</p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.techdept.co.uk/\" title=\"\"><strong>Techdept</strong></a></h2> <p>\"Young people want to work at Techdept,\" says founder and CEO Dan Kirby. His online technology agency based at the Electric Works buildings in Sheffield, sounds like every student's dream first job. The office comes with a three-storey helter skelter \u2013 the largest in Europe \u2013 which takes you from the top floor to the bottom in nine seconds.</p> <p>\"It's one of the coolest offices in the world. It wasn't the cheapest option but it's great, it's inspiring,\" says Kirby. \"We are a creative business and have a team of people who are young and ambitious and they want to come to an environment that has a buzz and is a cool place to be. It's a place which makes you want to up your game.\"</p> <p>But Techdept isn't just an office with a slide. Kirby says the business has been thriving since it created the Open Business System (OBS), a method of promoting best practice which aims to \"lock down the best methods of doing things while retaining the rights of employees to be able to change things\". The business pools its knowledge and experience to create checklists for projects. Staff must follow these, but are free to make alterations if better methods emerge.</p> <p>\"The system is the boss and we all have to follow the system,\" says Kirby. \"When people are in the cut and thrust of getting a website live, it's easy to forget small details. The system helps you through when you're busy. But our manuals admit that we might be wrong \u2013 we don't want people to follow blindly.\"</p> <p>Because of the OBS, managers no longer have to tell staff what to do. This has freed Kirby and his senior team to follow other projects such as R&amp;D and creating new initiatives. \"A lot of management is stuff which is in your head and hasn't been written down.\"</p> <h2><a href=\"http://caternet.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Caternet</a></h2> <p>Jerry Brand has been running businesses in the catering sector since the late 1980s. He is currently the managing director of Caternet, which provides an online procurement platform for the food and drinks industry. He says building a strong team is all about communication; allowing all staff to have input and talking to customers to find out what they want.</p> <p>\"We are constantly in touch with our customers. Your average IT business is not developed on service,\" says Brand. \"For me, the key thing is communication. People don't just get out of bed for money. They have to have job satisfaction. If you think about people who don't love their job \u2013 can they really be positive about things?\"</p> <p>Encouragingly for cash-strapped growing businesses, Brand believes an open and productive culture is a more effective for retaining staff than pay rises. \"You get great staff retention. I can't really remember when the last person left. But we aren't paying over commercial rates, our pay is sensible, but we are pushing the envelope from a technical point of view. A lot of buzzwords fly around, such as continuous improvement and knowledge sharing, but it's what happens.\"</p> <p>Brand also recommends giving staff the power to get on with things. His business has a mission statement and he believes leaders need to set out the direction but have faith in the judgment of their staff. \"You've got to be a leader and you have got to have confidence in your own leadership. But you've also got to trust them.\"</p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.wisemonkeymedia.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Wise Monkey Media</a></h2> <p>Successful entrepreneurs learn from their strengths and weakness, and many conclude that management and training is not always their strength. Others simply accept that there are professionals who can do a better job and that can help them too. James Neale is the founder of Wise Monkey Media, a creative media and advertising agency in Rock, North Cornwall. His business works with Oxford Innovation (OI), which provides mentoring and training for him and his team.</p> <p>\"You have to admit that sometimes you're not the best person to do the coaching,\" says Neale. \"I think bringing in a coach gives staff a sense of worth. It is a cost but it means they know that they are worth investing in.\"</p> <p>The business has six staff but in nearly three years of trading has managed to retain them all. His staff are graduates but the coaching enables them to take on big responsibilities, he says. \"My team are being asked to develop their own department. They have skills and specialisms from university, but the mentoring helps them with personal development. They are really good but hearing it from someone else is very helpful. The sessions help them to understand their potential, cope with time management and understand the significance of their work.\"</p> <p>Furthermore, he admits he's been on a learning curve since starting-up and recommends mentoring to other entrepreneurs. \"I see someone from OI every month to six weeks.

      "bodyText": "Creating a happy and productive workforce would be a dream come true for many business owners, but Britain's SMEs are getting better at it. There's a growing realisation among many entrepreneurs that they aren't always the best managers and might need a little help. Higher productivity can be achieved without crushing the morale of employees; some businesses use trainers and mentors, others create intelligent systems, while some opt to build an inspiring workspace. Here, three businesses share their methods: Techdept \"Young people want to work at Techdept,\" says founder and CEO Dan Kirby. His online technology agency based at the Electric Works buildings in Sheffield, sounds like every student's dream first job. The office comes with a three-storey helter skelter \u2013 the largest in Europe \u2013 which takes you from the top floor to the bottom in nine seconds. \"It's one of the coolest offices in the world. It wasn't the cheapest option but it's great, it's inspiring,\" says Kirby. \"We are a creative business and have a team of people who are young and ambitious and they want to come to an environment that has a buzz and is a cool place to be. It's a place which makes you want to up your game.\" But Techdept isn't just an office with a slide. Kirby says the business has been thriving since it created the Open Business System (OBS), a method of promoting best practice which aims to \"lock down the best methods of doing things while retaining the rights of employees to be able to change things\". The business pools its knowledge and experience to create checklists for projects. Staff must follow these, but are free to make alterations if better methods emerge. \"The system is the boss and we all have to follow the system,\" says Kirby. \"When people are in the cut and thrust of getting a website live, it's easy to forget small details. The system helps you through when you're busy. But our manuals admit that we might be wrong \u2013 we don't want people to follow blindly.\" Because of the OBS, managers no longer have to tell staff what to do. This has freed Kirby and his senior team to follow other projects such as R&amp;D and creating new initiatives. \"A lot of management is stuff which is in your head and hasn't been written down.\" Caternet Jerry Brand has been running businesses in the catering sector since the late 1980s. He is currently the managing director of Caternet, which provides an online procurement platform for the food and drinks industry. He says building a strong team is all about communication; allowing all staff to have input and talking to customers to find out what they want. \"We are constantly in touch with our customers. Your average IT business is not developed on service,\" says Brand. \"For me, the key thing is communication. People don't just get out of bed for money. They have to have job satisfaction. If you think about people who don't love their job \u2013 can they really be positive about things?\" Encouragingly for cash-strapped growing businesses, Brand believes an open and productive culture is a more effective for retaining staff than pay rises. \"You get great staff retention. I can't really remember when the last person left. But we aren't paying over commercial rates, our pay is sensible, but we are pushing the envelope from a technical point of view. A lot of buzzwords fly around, such as continuous improvement and knowledge sharing, but it's what happens.\" Brand also recommends giving staff the power to get on with things. His business has a mission statement and he believes leaders need to set out the direction but have faith in the judgment of their staff. \"You've got to be a leader and you have got to have confidence in your own leadership. But you've also got to trust them.\" Wise Monkey Media Successful entrepreneurs learn from their strengths and weakness, and many conclude that management and training is not always their strength. Others simply accept that there are professionals who can do a better job and that can help them too. James Neale is the founder of Wise Monkey Media, a creative media and advertising agency in Rock, North Cornwall. His business works with Oxford Innovation (OI), which provides mentoring and training for him and his team. \"You have to admit that sometimes you're not the best person to do the coaching,\" says Neale. \"I think bringing in a coach gives staff a sense of worth. It is a cost but it means they know that they are worth investing in.\" The business has six staff but in nearly three years of trading has managed to retain them all. His staff are graduates but the coaching enables them to take on big responsibilities, he says. \"My team are being asked to develop their own department. They have skills and specialisms from university, but the mentoring helps them with personal development. They are really good but hearing it from someone else is very helpful. The sessions help them to understand their potential, cope with time management and understand the significance of their work.\" Furthermore, he admits he's been on a learning curve since starting-up and recommends mentoring to other entrepreneurs. \"I see someone from OI every month to six weeks. It's not a formal discussion. It goes along the lines I take it but at the end of each session I walk away with something I can use to build my business.\" Training and mentoring There are many strong organisations offering training and mentoring for businesses. Here are three popular ones: Investors in people (IiP) Investors in People (IiP) is credited by many business owners with having a \"transformative effect\" on their enterprises. It works with employers to improve structure, employee engagement and focus on development and growth.

    "webTitle": "William Hill to close 109 shops, blaming hike in betting terminal duty", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The UK's largest bookmaker, William Hill, is to close 109 shops, blaming the government's surprise hike in betting taxes on high-speed, high-stakes gambling machines. In last month's budget, the chancellor raised duty from 20% to 25% on any machines that can charge more than \u00a35 to play, wiping out a significant portion of revenue from lucrative fixed-odds betting terminals (FOBTs), which account for half of bookmakers' gross profits. William Hill said that if the tax had been applied last year, it would have cost the company \u00a322m. Next year it said about 420 jobs could be lost as a result of the shop closures. The chief executive, Ralph Topping, said: \"As a direct result of the government's unexpected announcement about an increase in machine games duty to 25%, we have reviewed shop profitability and will be closing a portfolio of 109 shops this year, putting 420 shop employees at risk of redundancy. In a broadside against the government, Topping said those bearing the brunt of the tax rise would be young workers and female staff \u2013 and his company's woes would be replicated across the industry. He told analysts: \"We fully expect other companies in the industry to be in a similar position. What's the effect of all that? Well, there's lost revenue to the government. Lost rents and more empty shops on the high street. There's lost jobs. But who loses those jobs? Women, for part-time workers and for 18- to 24-year-olds. 57% of our retail colleagues are women, 30% of them are aged 18 to 24.\" The rise of the machines, on which punters can bet up to \u00a3300 a minute, has been dramatic and controversial. Accused of being highly addictive as well as being linked to crime, the terminals have been in ministers' sights since January, when the prime minister said there were \"problems in the betting and gambling industry\". In the next fortnight ministers are expected to announce a range of regulatory and planning powers to curb the clustering of shops. However, the industry is addicted to the cash that FOBTs generate. Since 2010, annual player losses have grown from \u00a31.3bn to \u00a31.5bn. In a conference call with analysts, William Hill, which has 2,434 outlets across the UK, admitted that each machine generated \u00a3926 a week, up from \u00a3904 the year before. There is also concern that betting shops are concentrated in poorer areas \u2013 a potential source of social disorder in vulnerable communities. A report in February found that more than \u00a313bn was gambled on high-stakes machines last year by the poorest quarter of England's population. Campaigners against the machines said they doubted whether the closures would be as substantial as the bookmakers claimed. Adrian Parkinson, a spokesman for the Campaign for Fairer Gambling, pointed out that last year William Hill had \"opened 120 shops but closed about 70\". \"In William Hill's 2013 annual report, the company state that they are continuing their strategy of increasing their estate by 1% each year. Indeed, in 2013 they ended up with 59 more shops than they started with. That was about a 2% increase in their shop estate. So it remains to be seen whether these proposed shop closures are negated by new shop openings and whether any of these closures will be compensated by relocations.\" Parkinson said that just two operators \u2013 Ladbrokes and William Hill \u2013 now own 52% of all UK betting shops \u2013 up from 48% just four years ago. Expansions such as this are often followed at some point by a reassessment of the whole estate, just as Ladbrokes, which has grown by 10% compared with William Hill's 5% growth over this period, has done. Shares in William Hill and Ladbrokes fell sharply last month. Ladbrokes has also said it will close shops. However, William Hill reported a further leap in the revenues from its betting websites, with stakes laid online by punters up 39% year on year. Gambling on mobile devices was up by 78%. But it said operating profits had fallen by 14%, which it partly attributed to two weeks out of 13 in the quarter when customers laid successful bets. Analysts said that the closure of stores would not affect William Hill's prospects unduly. Simon Gergel, at Allianz Global Investors, said: \"Overall we think William Hill is well positioned for the future of the UK and international betting industry, which is being driven increasingly by online betting.\"",

A report in February found that more than \u00a313bn was gambled on high-stakes machines last year by the poorest quarter of England's population.</p> <p>Campaigners against the machines said they doubted whether the closures would be as substantial as the bookmakers claimed. Adrian Parkinson, a spokesman for the Campaign for Fairer Gambling, pointed out that last year William Hill had \"opened 120 shops but closed about 70\".</p> <p>\"In William Hill's 2013 annual report, the company state that they are continuing their strategy of increasing their estate by 1% each year. Indeed, in 2013 they ended up with 59 more shops than they started with. That was about a 2% increase in their shop estate. So it remains to be seen whether these proposed shop closures are negated by new shop openings and whether any of these closures will be compensated by relocations.\"</p> <p>Parkinson said that just two operators \u2013 Ladbrokes and William Hill \u2013 now own 52% of all UK betting shops \u2013 up from 48% just four years ago. Expansions such as this are often followed at some point by a reassessment of the whole estate, just as Ladbrokes, which has grown by 10% compared with William Hill's 5% growth over this period, has done.</p> <p>Shares in William Hill and Ladbrokes fell sharply last month. Ladbrokes has also said it will close shops.</p> <p>However, William Hill reported a further leap in the revenues from its betting websites, with stakes laid online by punters up 39% year on year. Gambling on mobile devices was up by 78%. But it said operating profits had fallen by 14%, which it partly attributed to two weeks out of 13 in the quarter when customers laid successful bets.</p> <p>Analysts said that the closure of stores would not affect William Hill's prospects unduly. Simon Gergel, at Allianz Global Investors, said: \"Overall we think William Hill is well positioned for the future of the UK and international betting industry, which is being driven increasingly by online betting.\"</p>",
