      "bodyText": "The Australian dollar was punished on international markets overnight after stronger than expected American employment figures. The local currency was worth US77.12 cents on Saturday as it continues to track close to its lowest point for six years. The price of oil, gold and iron ore also fell after the release of the figures, which investors believe increases the chance of the US Federal Reserve raising interest rates later this year. Such a move would strengthen the greenback and put further downward pressure on the Australian dollar and other assets. Iron ore, Australia\u2019s biggest export commodity, fell by $1.10 a tonne overnight and is now fetching just $58.20 a tonne \u2013 a fall of more than 50% in the past 12 months. However, the falling Aussie dollar is likely to be welcomed by the Australian Reserve Bank governor Glenn Stevens, who believes the local currency has to fall to around US75c to make exports more competitive. By forcing the Australian dollar lower, the strong US recovery could also slightly weaken the case for further rate cuts by the RBA. Many market experts believe the RBA will cut again this year \u2013 possibly as early as its next meeting in early April \u2013 and bring the cash rate to a new record low of 2%. The non-farm payrolls report, which caused the main Wall Street stock markets to fall as investors anticipated the end of cheap money, showed that the US economy added 295,000 jobs in February compared with an expected 240,000. Over the past year the US has added an average of 270,000 jobs each month. Hiring from November through to February was the best four-month pace since the late 1990s.
