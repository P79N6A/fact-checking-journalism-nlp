      "bodyText": "Whatever Tuesday\u2019s first quarter GDP figures show, the next government should brace itself for a hard landing, according to an economics thinktank. A report produced by the New Policy Institute (NPI) has described Britain\u2019s economy as \u201cunbalanced\u201d and warns that another recession is inevitable unless various issues are addressed. Despite the fastest economic growth among advanced economies last year, most City analysts expect the UK to have lost steam in the opening months of this year. The consensus forecast is for quarterly growth to come in at 0.5%, down from 0.6% in the fourth quarter of 2014, when the first official estimate of GDP is published on Tuesday morning. Some economists see the growth rate halving to 0.3%, according to a Reuters poll. Beyond the latest quarter, the NPI\u2019s experts see several reasons to believe the UK economy is closer to the end of a period of growth than to the start of a sustained recovery. In their report entitled Beneath the Bonnet: How Sound is Britain\u2019s Economic Recovery? the thinktank looks at headline indicators and conclude that unless imbalances are addressed \u201canother recession is a matter of \u2018when\u2019, not \u2018if\u2019\u201d. Steve Barwick, one of the report\u2019s authors, says: If the UK economy can be likened to a four cylinder car, then actually not one of its four cylinders is firing as smoothly as it should. Productivity is in the doldrums. Employment is artificially high due to self-employment. Household income growth has been non-existent. Trade deficits are frighteningly high. Look beneath the bonnet and we find the UK economy both weak and unbalanced.\u201d NPI illustrates its conclusions with the following charts: 1. \u2018Productivity has barely grown\u2019 Labour productivity, a measure of what is produced for every hour worked, grew strongly after the recessions in the 70s, 80s and 90s whereas it has barely grown at all since the recession ended in mid-2009, says the NPI report. \u201cWithout productivity growth, real wages cannot grow,\u201d it adds. 2. \u2018Weakness behind the employment headlines\u2019 The total number in work and the employment rate are at record levels but the NPI says this is down to the rise in self-employment, income from which has fallen. \u201cThe level of zero-hours contracts points to further weakness behind the headlines,\u201d it adds. 3. \u2018Household income has not recovered\u2019 Instead of rebounding as it did after each of the last three recessions, real household disposable income is barely up on where it was in 2009, the NPI says. \u201cThis makes sustainable growth, let alone growth that feeds through to good living standards, far from assured,\u201d adds the report. 4. \u2018Imbalances abound\u2019 Britain has \u201ca huge balance of payments deficit, a too low level of corporate investment and households spending to the hilt,\u201d the NPI report says. 5. \u2018The coalition cut too far, too soon \u2013 although eventually scaled back\u2019 The thinktank says the deficit, 4.8% of GDP in the latest financial year, has not come down by as much as the coalition had planned at the outset. \u201cThe coalition followed its own plan for about two and half years but then switched tack after two and a half years of low or no growth,\u201d the report says. The NPI says the coalition\u2019s austerity plan cut too far, too fast, choking off growth for two years and \u201ceroding the foundations of a sustained recovery\u201d. But in the event, the original plan was abandoned anyway.",

    "webTitle": "Cameron should back BP openly and name companies that need protecting", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "David Cameron doesn\u2019t want BP to be sold. Indeed, as the FT reports, Downing Street has told the oil company privately that any takeover deal would be resisted. Since the government lacks powers to intervene, it\u2019s unclear what it would actually do if ExxonMobil, say, had a pop at a price that made BP shareholders salivate. At a push, the government could try to erect a few obstacles in a hurry, as it did when Pfizer bid for AstraZeneca in 2014, and hope the bidder goes away. But that\u2019s about it. Such an informal, muddy-the-waters, strategy is a cop-out. There are only two coherent positions to hold on major takeovers, especially takeovers from overseas. The first is an open-doors approach, in which shareholders are left to decide when there are no competition objections. Such a laissez-faire view is supposed to be the UK\u2019s current policy, with the exceptions of defence (on grounds of security) and media (plurality). The second position is the opposite: adopt a public interest test for major bids and describe, roughly, how it would be applied. As it happens, this column is in the second camp. Any hesitation disappeared with the Pfizer/AstraZeneca offer, which thankfully failed. The US bidder had a record of making deep cuts in research and development budgets at every company it had bought for a decade and its pledges to invest in AZ were short-term and non-binding. Shareholders\u2019 rights of ownership matter, of course, but they shouldn\u2019t be the sole consideration when bigger factors, like the quality of the UK\u2019s long-term science base, are at stake. It would have been better if the government, instead of bargaining with Pfizer over investment and employment, had been able to say no. With its behind the scenes lobbying of BP, the government seems to agree. It appears to want a power of veto \u2013 but it isn\u2019t prepared to say so, or argue for the right. That\u2019s just feeble. If Cameron &amp; co think it is vitally important that the UK has two big oil companies (actually, one and a half, since Shell is Anglo-Dutch), they should let everybody know where they stand. Equally, if they think certain companies need protection, let\u2019s hear the names. The government still has a golden share in BAE Systems and Rolls-Royce. But one could name other major UK companies whose investments are as crucial to the UK as BP\u2019s. Try: AZ itself, BT, Centrica, GlaxoSmithKline and National Grid. Would Downing Street, under its new line of thinking, try to protect any of that collection? It\u2019s anybody\u2019s guess. Ten days ahead of a general election, the prime minister seems to have adopted a new industrial policy on takeovers.

      "body": "<p>David Cameron doesn\u2019t want BP to be sold. Indeed, as the FT reports, Downing Street has told the oil company privately that any takeover deal would be resisted. Since the government lacks powers to intervene, it\u2019s unclear what it would actually do if ExxonMobil, say, had a pop at a price that made BP shareholders salivate. At a push, the government could try to erect a few obstacles in a hurry, as it did when Pfizer bid for AstraZeneca in 2014, and hope the bidder goes away. But that\u2019s about it.</p> <p>Such an informal, muddy-the-waters, strategy is a cop-out. There are only two coherent positions to hold on major takeovers, especially takeovers from overseas. The first is an open-doors approach, in which shareholders are left to decide when there are no competition objections. Such a laissez-faire view is supposed to be the UK\u2019s current policy, with the exceptions of defence (on grounds of security) and media (plurality). The second position is the opposite: adopt a public interest test for major bids and describe, roughly, how it would be applied.</p> <p>As it happens, this column is in the second camp. Any hesitation disappeared with the Pfizer/AstraZeneca offer, which thankfully failed. The US bidder had a record of making deep cuts in research and development budgets at every company it had bought for a decade and its pledges to invest in AZ were short-term and non-binding.</p> <p>Shareholders\u2019 rights of ownership matter, of course, but they shouldn\u2019t be the sole consideration when bigger factors, like the quality of the UK\u2019s long-term science base, are at stake. It would have been better if the government, instead of bargaining with Pfizer over investment and employment, had been able to say no.</p> <p>With its behind the scenes lobbying of BP, the government seems to agree. It appears to want a power of veto \u2013 but it isn\u2019t prepared to say so, or argue for the right.</p> <p>That\u2019s just feeble. If Cameron &amp; co think it is vitally important that the UK has two big oil companies (actually, one and a half, since Shell is Anglo-Dutch), they should let everybody know where they stand. </p> <p>Equally, if they think certain companies need protection, let\u2019s hear the names. The government still has a golden share in BAE Systems and Rolls-Royce. But one could name other major UK companies whose investments are as crucial to the UK as BP\u2019s. Try: AZ itself, BT, Centrica, GlaxoSmithKline and National Grid. Would Downing Street, under its new line of thinking, try to protect any of that collection? It\u2019s anybody\u2019s guess.</p> <p>Ten days ahead of a general election, the prime minister seems to have adopted a new industrial policy on takeovers. It\u2019s just that he hasn\u2019t announced it \u2013 nor described how he might deliver it.</p> <h2>Gone flat?</h2> <p>Talk to Diageo\u2019s top brass these days and they tend to be very bullish about India.

      "bodyText": "Centrica suffered a protest vote over pay at its annual meeting on Monday when one in three investors failed to back a pay deal for its new boss, Iain Conn. The annual meeting was held after the owner of British Gas announced it was hiring more than 350 service staff and pledged to spend \u00a350m to make life easier for its customers after more than 300,000 of them defected last year. Just 67% of investors voted in favour of the remuneration report at the annual general meeting, after influential shareholder advisory body ISS had raised concerns about the pay deal for Conn, hired from BP last year. His pay and shares package was worth up to \u00a33.7m when it was announced in July, but is less than that of his predecessor, Sam Laidlaw. There was no protest about Conn\u2019s election to the board. The UK\u2019s biggest household energy supplier said it would recruit the new staff immediately in Manchester, Leeds, Cardiff and Edinburgh. Centrica said the extra spending over three years showed the commitment of Conn. In a trading statement published before the AGM, Centrica said British Gas\u2019s customer numbers stopped falling in the first three months of 2015 after it cut prices. However, the group said it needed to make further changes in order to hang on to retain those customers. British Gas lost 368,000 customers last year, ending 2014 with 14.8 million residential accounts. The company reviewed its customer numbers at the end of the year and found it had overestimated them by 110,000. British Gas wants to reduce call times, give out better information and make it easier to use its website. A recent survey by Which? ranked British Gas 15th out of 18 suppliers surveyed for customer satisfaction. Conn, who took over in January, said: \u201cCustomers tell us they want excellent service when they deal with their energy supplier. We\u2019re making a substantial and long-term commitment today, which will help us achieve that goal. In addition to new jobs, the \u00a350m will fund significant investment in training and new systems to improve customer service.\u201d Centrica and other big energy companies are under political and regulatory pressure over their treatment of UK energy customers, reflecting public uproar over the cost of household bills. Uncertainty surrounding the closely fought election and the Competition and Markets Authority\u2019s investigation into the energy sector were listed among the main risks to its annual earnings. Ed Miliband has pledged to freeze domestic energy prices and shake up regulation to give customers a better deal if Labour wins next week\u2019s election. The CMA preliminary view, released in February, was that the big six energy companies charged loyal, often vulnerable, customers up to \u00a3234 more per year than those who shopped around. With about a month until the CMA publishes its intitial report, consumer group Which? said the regulator should make increased consumer understanding and involvement its top priority. The campaign group called for simpler pricing and protection for uninformed customers so that they do not languish on expensive tariffs. Household energy consumption rose in the first quarter because of cold weather, increasing British Gas\u2019s profitability. Operating profit at British Gas fell 20% to \u00a3823m last year because of a sharp drop in demand during the warmest year on record. Centrica said improved profitability at British Gas would be more than offset by pressure from low oil prices on its exploration and production business. The company said tax reductions announced in the budget to help North Sea producers would help the business, although profits are too low for a benefit to be registered this year. Mark Hodges, the former head of Aviva\u2019s UK business, is due to join British Gas as managing director at the start of June. Centrica said it chose Hodges because he had a record of improving customer service and working with regulators.",

    "webTitle": "Markets rally after Greek government reshuffles negotiating team", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Hopes of a breakthrough in Greece\u2019s drawn-out talks with its creditors followed news of a restructuring of its negotiating team and sent European shares higher, writes Nick Fletcher. With finance minister Yanis Varoufakis supposedly sidelined, and reports in Germany\u2019s Bild that a new set of - more conciliatory - reforms will be presented this week, investors were prepared to look on the positive side. It was not only shares that benefited; Greek bonds were also on the rise. But aside from Greece, there were still uncertainties, notably around the UK election and the prospects for US interest rates when the Federal Reserve meets this week. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished at a new record close of 7103.98, up 33.28 points or 0.47% Germany\u2019s Dax added 1.93% to 12,039.16 France\u2019s Cac closed up 1.3% at 5268.91 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB finished 1.62% ahead at 23,806.27 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended 1.17% better at 11,640.2 The Athens market jumped 4.37% to 794.84 But ahead of the Fed, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has lost its early gains and is currently down 11 points or 0.07%. On that note, it\u2019s time to close up for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. Now for some slightly negative news from Greece, with the government\u2019s call for money from regional institutions not being universally agreed: Felix Herrmann, a market strategist at DZ Bank, agrees that the Greek reshuffle has calmed nerves in the markets: \u201cThe Eurogroup meeting in Riga showed Varoufakis was more or less isolated and it seems that Tsipras has understood that. \u201cThe market is a bit relieved...(that) his influence has decreased.\u201d (although, as we flagged up earlier, this isn\u2019t the first time Yanis has been sidelined) More here: The rally in Greek bonds is picking up pace too, clawing back losses after Friday\u2019s Eurogroup debacle. That\u2019s still a very high bond yield, reflecting a high risk of default; just less than earlier. News that Greece is rebooting its negotiating team sparked a new wave optimism across stock markets this afternoon. Jasper Lawler of CMC Markets explains: European markets appear to be dusting themselves off from the sharp declines seen in the middle of the month with large gains to start the week. Stalled Greek bailout negotiations have left stocks below record highs but there was a bit more optimism on Monday with Athens seemingly having sidelined its trouble-making finance minister, Yanis Varoufakis. If the Syriza-led government of Alexis Tsipras want to progress in negotiations and avoid default, it\u2019s probably the right move to put its finance minister on the proverbial chopping block. After three months of attempting to reach a better deal for Greece and roll back austerity, Mr Varoufakis has only succeeded in frustrating creditors. German markets led the way as the German Dax jumped over 1.5% with Volkswagen one of the best performers after it Chairman Ferdinand Piech stepped down. More expressions of surprise that the Greek move to reshape its negotiating team has had such a strong reaction in the markets: Eurozone crisis experts are surprised to see the rally in Greek bonds, and European shares generally: Greece has attempted to breath new life into its stalling talks with its creditors, by shaking up its negotiating team. Alexis Tsipras\u2019s government is creating a new \u201cpolitical negotiation team\u201d, under junior foreign minister Euclid Tsakalotos, a 55-year-old economics professor. The move may take embattled finance minister Yanis Varoufakis out of the firing line, after eurozone ministers were \u201chighly critical\u201d of recent progress (and lack there of) at last Friday\u2019s meeting in Riga. Nektaria Stamouli of the Wall Street Journal explains: Greece\u2019s alternate foreign minister, Euclid Tsakalotos, will head a new policy negotiating team, a senior government official said, while the finance ministry\u2019s chief economist will lead talks in Brussels with the heads of the country\u2019s international creditors \u2014 a formation known as the Brussels Group. Both people are seen as close allies of Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras. Financial markets have welcomed the news. European stock markets are now positive, and Greek bond yields have fallen; showing a lower danger of default. GREEK 2-YEAR GOVT BOND YIELDS FALL OVER 100 BPS TO DAY\u2019S LOW OF 24.87% - TRADEWEB There\u2019s also a rumour, published by Germany\u2019s Bild, that Greece could bow to pressure and not drop plans to raise the Greek minimum wage back towards pre-crisis levels. The reshuffle came a day after Varoufakis caused a stir by tweeting a quote from Franklin D Roosevelt: \u201cFDR, 1936: \u2018they are unanimous in their hate for me; and I welcome their hatred\u2019. A quotation close to my heart (&amp; reality) these days,\u201d.... Last night, the Financial Times reported that Varoufakis could be sidelined after being criticised by fellow finance ministers in Riga on Friday. So fierce was the session that Varoufakis ducked dinner with the rest of the Eurogroup on Friday night. Opposition politicians have called for Varoufakis to resign today, blaming his intransigence for the lack of progress towards a reform plan that would persuade lenders to advance some cash soon. Dora Bakoyanni of the opposition New Democracy party urged Varoufakis to fall on his sword: He has to resign today to make things easier for Mr Tsipras and to liberate him so that it doesn\u2019t seem that he is being sacked on the orders of people abroad.\u201d But government insiders say that Tsipras still has confidence in his finance minister. Greece remains under pressure to hurry up and produce credible reforms. A Gemran finance ministry spokesman said the constant delays were \u201cfrustrating\u201d, while Italy\u2019s economy minister says the eurozone wants \u201ca rapid accord\u201d that keeps Greece in the euro. Tsipras is also due to speak about the crisis late tonight. Greece faces a string of repayments in the next few weeks, including wages and pensions and almost \u20ac1bn to the IMF. Analysts at UBS have warned that this could trigger a rapid exit from the eurozone, or a slower one.... Analysts at UBS have outlined two methods by which Greece could leave the eurozone: (1) The fast route: A rapid deposit withdrawal from the banking system, if the Eurosystem refused to finance it through expansion of the ELA facility. The government would then need to refinance (and probably recapitalise) the banking system by creating a new currency to do so. However, this could probably be slowed with the imposition of capital controls limiting deposit withdrawal. (2) The slow(er) route: The government, running out of funds, could substitute IOUs for euros in some of its payments. Starting with payments to suppliers (including for pharmaceuticals, as in 2011), and then - in theory - progressing on to public sector salaries and pensions over time. As current Greek debt obligations are not valued at their face value by the bond market, nor would these notes be, meaning that their purchasing power would likely be lower than that of the euro. In this way, the parallel currency would already be devalued. The more of these notes that were issued, the greater the need would be for the banking system to clear payments in them. The need would also increase for businesses and citizens to use them to pay taxes. As this continued, it would be likely that more euros would leak out of the Greek banking system and the economy would rely on the new currency to a greater extent. Nominally, Greece could (in theory, and just conceivably) remain in the euro under these circumstances, but there would come a point in this process at which it had in a practical sense already left. They\u2019ve also produced a chart, showing the consequences of Greece missing various payments: The word in Athens is that the reshuffled Greek negotiating team will meet tonight, at 6.30pm local time or 4.30pm BST. Life has been continuing as normal in Athens today, despite growing public concerns over the negotiations with creditors. Over the weekend, a survey by Alco showed that 50% of the public want a compromise even if creditors reject the Greek government demands, while 36% felt the government should opt for a \u201crupture\u201d if it is spurned. Over in Berlin, the German government gave Greece the hurry-up this morning. Finance ministry spokesman Martin Jaeger told reporters that the lack of a credible reform plan is Athens\u2019 fault: \u201cOur goal is to keep Greece in the euro. That\u2019s what we are working for intensively. But we have to make it clear once more that the ball is in Greece\u2019s court.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re waiting for proposals and have been waiting for weeks. It\u2019s frustrating but we are patient.\u201d (quotes via Reuters) With or without Yanis at the wheel, it will be hard for Greece\u2019s government to agree a reform programme that is acceptable to both its lenders and its own left-wing MPs. Germany\u2019s Bild tabloid is reporting that Greece is planning to present a new list of reforms to creditors on Wednesday. It includes abandoning plans to raise the minimum wage. You can see the story on Bild\u2019s website (scroll down to find their news ticker). Combined with the shake-up off the Greek negotiating team (see 11am), and perhaps the wheels are moving again?.... Italy\u2019s economy minister, Pier Carlo Padoan, has denied that the eurozone is now secretly planning for life without Greece. Padoan told reporters in Rome: \u201cAs far as I\u2019m aware, there is no Plan B on Greece...The aim is to get a rapid accord with Athens.\u201d On Friday, though, the FT reported that Slovenia\u2019s representative told the Eurogroup that if bailout talks did not progress more quickly the eurozone should prepare a \u201cPlan B\u201d to deal with a Greek default. Reuters has also been told that Yanis Varoufakis still enjoys the support of PM Tsipras (as flagged earlier) But despite these signals, Greek negotiating team is being shaken up - giving more responsibility to Euclid Tsakalotos, the government\u2019s chief economics spokesman. Via Reuters: Tsipras, in a meeting on Sunday with senior aides and ministers including the deputy prime minister and economy minister, expressed support for Varoufakis and agreed the finance minister will supervise a new group to lead \u201cpolitical talks\u201d with lenders. However, deputy Foreign Minister Euclid Tsakalotos will be tasked with coordinating the group, the official said, suggesting the Oxford-educated economist and professor would have a more active role in talks with the EU and IMF. \u201cSupport for Finance Minister Yanis Varoufakis, who has been targeted by international media reports, was confirmed during the meeting,\u201d the government official said. \u201cThe finance minister always acts in line with collective decisions and the government\u2019s leadership.\u201d Reports are coming in that Greece\u2019s negotiating team is being shaken up: Over in Athens calls are growing for the Greek finance minister\u2019s head, after he came away from last Friday\u2019s eurogroup with criticism ringing in his ears, and no signs of progress with creditors. Government insiders, though, say Yanis Varoufakis still enjoys the support of PM Alexis Tsipras. Athens correspondent Helena Smith reports: It has not taken long for the morning TV shows to host politicians calling for Yanis Varoufakis to go. First amongst them this morning was Dora Bakoyannis, the former foreign minister widely seen as the leader-in-waiting at New Democracy, the main opposition party. Bakoyannis told Skai TV that: \u201cHe has to resign today to make things easier for Mr Tsipras and to liberate him so that it doesn\u2019t seem that he is being sacked on the orders of people abroad.\u201d Accusing the academic-turned-politician of untrammeled \u201cnarcissism\u201d she said the finance minister had not only become an impediment in negotiations with creditors but was endangering the country and the future of all Greeks. Bakoyannis claimed: \u201cI am not at all sure that Mr Varoufakis has not adopted the logic of the drachma....Mr Varoufakis is an impediment for Greece.\u201d Bakoyannis added it was unforgiveable that the outspoken Greek finance minister had elected not to attend Friday\u2019s euro group dinner \u201cbut go off with friends instead of trying to negotiate when the country is dependent on these people for loans.\u201d Varoufakis\u2019 removal would enable Tsipras to take what is bound to be the unpopular step of compromising with lenders. Bakoyannis also argued that Varoufakis wouldn\u2019t suffer if he quit political life: \u201cMr Varoufakis will be alright, he will be able to go on and lecture in universities but does he think of ordinary Greeks who do not have such possibilities?\u201d. Despite the uproar, the official line remains that the Greek prime minister is standing by his friend. \u201cIf he is let go it will be only once a deal is achieved,\u201d confided one insider. \u201cVaroufakis may not be to everyone\u2019s taste in Syriza,\u201d he said of the governing leftwing party, \u201cbut he has managed to internationalise the Greek problem. A lot of good cop, bad cop is being played. After Tsipras\u2019 positive meeting with Merkel last week, it was only to be expected they [euro zone finance ministers] would round on Varoufakis.\u201d Breaking away from Greece for a moment; Japan has just been hit with a credit rating downgrade. Fitch cut Japan\u2019s rating by one notch, from A+ to A; the sixth-highest credit rating available. It blamed the cut on Tokyo\u2019s failure to agree \u201csufficient structural fiscal measures\u201d in its most recent budget, to make up for delaying a sales tax rise. Fitch is concerned that Japanese growth has been weaker than expected, given its huge national debt: Japan\u2019s main sovereign credit and rating weakness is the high and rising level of government debt. Fitch projects the gross general government (GG) debt to GDP ratio to rise to 244% of GDP by end-2015, by far the highest ratio of any rated sovereign. More here: Fitch Downgrades Japan to \u2018A\u2019; Outlook Stable Jeroen Dijsselbloem has also confirmed that he spoke with Greek PM Tsipras after Friday\u2019s Eurogroup dramas in Riga. Asked by De Volkskrant whether Yanis Varoufakis was the right man to handle the negotiations, Dijsselbloem replied that the issues go beyond Varoufakis\u2019s remit: Yes, it is about the budget and the financial sector but also on privatization, labor market and pensions. So much more than the portfolio of the Minister of Finance..... Thus is it \u201cobvious\u201d that Dijsselbloem should speak with the man at the top, Tsipras. Is Yanis Varougakis being painted as the fall guy by eurozone members who have lost patience with Greece? Alastair Winter, chief economist at investment bank Daniel Stewart\u2019s, suspects so. He writes: It appears that Mr Varoufakis, a renowned exponent of game theory, may have mistaken the game that the Northerners are playing. Encouraged by Messrs Juncker, Draghi, Moscovici and Ms Lagarde, he is playing the game to avoid Grexit. In his post-meeting interviews he said \u201cAny mention of a plan B is profoundly anti-European, My immediate response was to say there is no such plan B, there cannot be such a plan B.\u201d However, the Northerners\u2019 game seems more like avoiding getting the blame for Grexit even if they cannot yet agree a Plan B (because of opposition from those encouraging Mr Varoufakis). The Greeks are still holding out for the last \u20ac7.2bn tranche from the second bail-out, no more supervision by the lenders and release from most if not all current budgetary and structural reform targets. Once that is out the way, they then will want to talk about a third bail-out. The current stand-off probably means the first crunch date is May 12th when a \u20ac0.75bn repayment is due to the IMF. Things would move quickly after a default but the exact sequence is unclear. Assuming the Northerners refuse to blink, drachmas would soon be needed to pay suppliers, salaries and pensions. This in turn would necessitate nationalising the banks and introducing exchange controls. Mr Draghi\u2019s nightmare will have come true: EMU would be seen not to be irreversible after all. Then it will be Mr Juncker\u2019s turn: will Greece be able to stay in the EU? Good news for readers whose grasp of Greek is as poor as mine; Enikos will translating Alexis Tsipras\u2019s interview tonight into English (from 9.30pm UK time, I think) Eurogroup chief Jeroen Dijsselbloem has told Dutch newspaper De Volkskrant that Greece will not require a \u201cgreat\u201d new bailout when its existing programme expires. Asked about rumours that a \u20ac30bn-\u20ac50bn loan will be needed, Dijsselbloem indicated that any third bailout would be smaller than the existing \u20ac130bn deal that expires in June. Dijsselbloem said: I\u2019m not going to speculate on the extent, but the amounts are of an entirely different order than the current help. I forgot to mention this earlier, but Alexis Tsipras is giving a live TV interview late tonight, to discuss the debt crisis. The Enikos newspaper explains: Mr. Tsipras will answer questions from leading journalist Nikos Chatzinikolaou and an invited audience on all the critical issues facing Greece and the negotiations with its lenders. It starts at 11.30pm Greek time, or 9.30pm if you\u2019re in the UK. Greek bonds are weakening this morning, pushing up yields further into the danger zone. The yields on Greece\u2019s two-year bond has jumped to 26.8%, up from 26% on Friday night, showing a higher risk of default. And that means the spread between Greek bonds and the rest of the eurozone has widened further: Yanis Varoufakis is making headlines today, but not in the way he\u2019d like: Greek worries are pushing Europe\u2019s stock markets down in early trading, with France\u2019s CAC index losing 1%: Koji Fukaya, CEO of FPG Securities, explains that investors see the Greek crisis heading towards a climax: Proposals from Greece do not include important issues such as pension cuts and labour market reforms and are not something the creditors will be able to stomach.\u201d Lots of chatter about Greece this morning: A German government spokesman has confirmed reports that chancellor Merkel spoke with the Greek prime minister by phone yesterday. Although Berlin won\u2019t say what was discussed, the fact the call took place at all suggests that Alexis Tsipras is taking a more hands-on role. One Greek official has briefed that the two leaders: \u201cexpressed their common will for a steady communication throughout the course of negotiations in order to have a mutually beneficial solution soon\u201d Merkel and Tsipras also held a face-to-face meeting in Brussels last Thursday; it was said to be constructive, unlike the finance ministers\u2019 meeting that followed it..... The Financial Times is also reporting that Yanis Varoufakis is being sidelined, after last Friday\u2019s \u201chighly critical\u201d eurogroup meeting: Here\u2019s a flavour: Greece\u2019s dire financial position is forcing eurozone authorities to look beyond Mr Varoufakis to Alexis Tsipras, prime minister, much like in February when Jeroen Dijsselbloem, the Dutch finance minister who chairs the eurogroup, brokered an extension of the current bailout programme. According to two eurozone officials, Mr Dijsselbloem phoned Mr Tsipras from Riga in an effort to mend fences after Friday\u2019s feisty eurogroup meeting, where Mr Varoufakis was rounded on by his eurozone colleagues. In a sign that Mr Varoufakis\u2019s combative approach is prompting concern in Greece as well, a senior Athens official said the Riga meeting was likely to lead to him being sidelined as Mr Tsipras and his deputy Yannis Dragasakis take a more hands-on role. Amid the acrimony, differences over a new list of reforms that is to be agreed by Athens were barely discussed at the meeting, putting off indefinitely a deal to unlock access to the funds left from Greece\u2019s \u20ac172bn bailout. \u201cAll the ministers told [Mr Varoufakis]: this cannot go on,\u201d said Luis de Guindos, Spain\u2019s finance minister.... Full story: Eurozone officials seek to bypass Varoufakis to spur Greek talks Varoufakis wasn\u2019t completely ostracised over the weekend, though. Czech finance minister Andrej Babis insisted on sharing a \u2018selfie\u2019 with him on Saturday. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of events around the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. It looks like another week dominated by Greece\u2019s debt crisis. The dust is settling after Friday\u2019s dramatic Eurogroup meeting in Riga, where divisions between Athens and its creditors burst into the public eye. And with eurozone ministers refusing to hand over any money without seeing a list of credible reforms, talk of a Greek default is growing louder by the day. It emerged over the weekend that Yanis Varoufakis ducked out of Friday night\u2019s official dinner, following the bruising eurogroup meeting where he was heavily criticised by the rest of the eurogroup. \u201cHe is completely isolated,\u201d a senior euro zone official told Reuters on condition of anonymity. \u201cHe didn\u2019t even come to the dinner to represent his country,\u201d the official said of the event where ministers, serenaded by a Latvian choir, ate salmon and sea bass. Varoufakis hit back on Twitter last night: Roosevelt is a fine role model. But Varoufakis\u2019s tweeting has fuelled speculation that he is being sidelined as the Greek crisis steadily escalates. As IG\u2019s Chris Weston puts it: Greece has moved somewhat closer to a technical default after the weekend\u2019s antics, although it seems the majority of Europe\u2019s finance ministers have had about as much as they can take of the Greek finance minister Yanis Varoufakis and will look to deal directly with top dog Alexis Tsipras from here on in. And the latest opinion polling shows the public are getting edgy; 72% of Greece\u2019s want to see a deal struck with creditors, while only 23% favour a clash. Technical officials representing both sides should hold a conference call today, in the hope of getting closer to the comprehensive list of reforms sought by the Institutions who funded Greece\u2019s bailout. So we\u2019ll be watching out for developments there, along with other news through the day....",

The government would then need to refinance (and probably recapitalise) the banking system by creating a new currency to do so. However, this could probably be slowed with the imposition of capital controls limiting deposit withdrawal.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>(2) The slow(er) route:</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The government, running out of funds, could substitute IOUs for euros in some of its payments. Starting with payments to suppliers (including for pharmaceuticals, as in 2011), and then - in theory - progressing on to public sector salaries and pensions over time. As current Greek debt obligations are not valued at their face value by the bond market, nor would these notes be, meaning that their purchasing power would likely be lower than that of the euro. In this way, the parallel currency would already be devalued. </p> <p>The more of these notes that were issued, the greater the need would be for the banking system to clear payments in them. The need would also increase for businesses and citizens to use them to pay taxes. As this continued, it would be likely that more euros would leak out of the Greek banking system and the economy would rely on the new currency to a greater extent. </p> <p>Nominally, Greece could (in theory, and just conceivably) remain in the euro under these circumstances, but there would come a point in this process at which it had in a practical sense already left. </p> </blockquote> <p>They\u2019ve also produced a chart, showing the consequences of Greece missing various payments:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a76bee5dd8483ed7d016d4d5d39bc825ef09b073\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/4/27/1430137669654/3bb8324e-802c-442a-bf0e-bdc0489dbc23-460x346.png\" alt=\"Greek default scenarios\" width=\"460\" height=\"346\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Greek default scenarios</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: UBS</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-553e29b3e4b02b6ca8a6373a\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2015-04-27T12:22:03.251Z\">1.22pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The word in Athens is that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2015/apr/27/greek-finance-minister-debt-talks-eurozone-live#block-553e0700e4b040bad389a33d\">the reshuffled Greek negotiating team</a> will meet tonight, at 6.30pm local time or 4.30pm BST. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/ManosGiakoumis/statuses/592663887809482752\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>The new <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Greece?src=hash\">#Greece</a> negotiating team is convening at 6.30 pm, according to local media <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/politics?src=hash\">#politics</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/economy?src=hash\">#economy</a></p>&mdash; Manos Giakoumis (@ManosGiakoumis) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ManosGiakoumis/status/592663887809482752\">April 27, 2015</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-553e2608e4b0f1a3d74a8759\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2015-04-27T12:12:24.881Z\">1.12pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Life has been continuing as normal in Athens today, despite growing public concerns over the negotiations with creditors. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"24bef5b0f364a17d10b9acb1df19f7f291b8c2c3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/24bef5b0f364a17d10b9acb1df19f7f291b8c2c3/0_111_4928_2957/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A man looks at fruits and vegetables at the Athens main market on April 27, 2015.

Encouraged by Messrs Juncker, Draghi, Moscovici and Ms Lagarde, he is playing the game to avoid Grexit. In his post-meeting interviews he said \u201c<em>Any mention of a plan B is profoundly anti-European, My immediate response was to say there is no such plan B, there cannot be such a plan B</em>.\u201d </p> <p>However, the Northerners\u2019 game seems more like avoiding getting the blame for Grexit even if they cannot yet agree a Plan B (because of opposition from those encouraging Mr Varoufakis). The Greeks are still holding out for the last \u20ac7.2bn tranche from the second bail-out, no more supervision by the lenders and release from most if not all current budgetary and structural reform targets. Once that is out the way, they then will want to talk about a third bail-out.</p> <p>The current stand-off probably means the first crunch date is May 12<sup>th</sup> when a \u20ac0.75bn repayment is due to the IMF. Things would move quickly after a default but the exact sequence is unclear. Assuming the Northerners refuse to blink, drachmas would soon be needed to pay suppliers, salaries and pensions. This in turn would necessitate nationalising the banks and introducing exchange controls. Mr Draghi\u2019s nightmare will have come true: EMU would be seen not to be irreversible after all.

Addressing interested investors as \u201chey guys\u201d, the brewer said its lawyers have requested a \u201cfew legal updates\u201d to materials it sent out last week about the offer to buy its shares on its own \u201cEquity for Punks\u201d investing platform. \u201cOur press releases described the Equity for Punks share offer as a \u2018UKLA accredited investment scheme\u2019 or a \u2018UKLA approved investment\u2019. This is not correct,\u201d investors are told in the email signed by \u201cJames and the team\u201d. James is James Watt, BrewDog\u2019s co-founder, who launched the business in 2007. The Aberdeenshire-based brewer is asking customers to make a minimum outlay of \u00a395 for two shares. The UKLA is the UK Listing Authority, part of the Financial Conduct Authority. The email said: \u201cYou should note that the UKLA can\u2019t comment on the merits of investing with us and don\u2019t endorse any share offers, they have only approved our investment prospectus.\u201d Investors are also told to \u201cignore the point we made in our email about the past increase in value\u201d from previous investment projects. This is because it \u201cisn\u2019t something we specifically talked about in our prospectus and have not sought to verify for those purposes which means that we can\u2019t mention it in communications regarding this offer\u201d. Asked about the clarification, Watt said the company wanted to be as open with investors as possible and wanted to be completely compliant with regulations.",

      "bodyText": "Chipotle will no longer use genetically modified food in its stores, the company announced on Monday. The fast-growing Mexican restaurant chain will be the first US company to use only non-GM ingredients. \u201cThere is a lot of debate about genetically modified foods,\u201d Steve Ells, the founder, chairman and co-CEO of Chipotle, said. \u201cThough many countries have already restricted or banned the use of GMO crops, it\u2019s clear that a lot of research is still needed before we can truly understand all of the implications of widespread GMO cultivation and consumption. While that debate continues, we decided to move to non-GMO ingredients.\u201d Eliminating GMO ingredients is no easy feat, and the company has previously struggled to keep up with other pledges it has made, including the use of ethically raised pork. More than 90% of corn and soy grown in the US comes from GMO strains. GMOs are present in 75% to 80% of conventional processed food in the US, according to the Grocery Manufacturers Association. In order to use only non-GMO ingredients in its stores, Chipotle has been working with its suppliers to increase their production of non-GMO corn flour and sunflowers. \u201cWe\u2019re working with our farmers to plan enough of these crops we need to meet our supply,\u201d Ells told the New York Times. Chipotle has voluntarily disclosed GMO ingredients in its food since 2013, and had at that time pledged that it would eliminate GMO ingredients from its food. According to Ells, the transition was more straightforward because many stores already used non-GMO food. The company also has a smaller list of ingredients than its competitors. Excluding tortillas, the entire chipotle menu is just 46 ingredients, according to Chipotle. The next step in providing its customers with \u201cthe very best ingredients\u201d is re-inventing its tortillas. \u201cTortillas are the only food item on Chipotle\u2019s menu that contains any additives, which include a minimal number of preservatives and dough conditioners,\u201d the company said in a statement on Monday. It added that it is \u201cnow embarking on a quest to eliminate all of the remaining additives\u201d. Last week, same-store sales at Chipotle rose 10.4% for the first quarter, missing projected 11.8% growth, according to figures released on Tuesday. \u201cI\u2019m pleased with our performance for the first quarter,\u201d Ells said at that time. \u201cAnd we\u2019re off to a strong start in 2015.\u201d Chipotle, which operates about 1,800 restaurants, plans to open between 190 and 205 more stores in 2015. The main reason for the lower-than-expected sales in the first quarter was its pork shortage. \u201cCarnitas customers really love our pork, and aren\u2019t visiting unless they know we have carnitas in their market,\u201d John Hartung, Chipotle\u2019s chief financial officer, said on Tuesday. \u201cThey order that favorite meal every single time they visit. Many decided to hold out until carnitas returns to their market.\u201d In 2011, Chipotle launched its first sustainable farming campaign. Earlier this year, an audit revealed that one of the suppliers was not complying with the chain\u2019s progressive animal welfare standards and as a result, the company stopped selling carnitas at one third of its locations. The company said it might increase prices in the coming months. \u201cChipotle\u2019s move to non-GMO ingredients did not result in significantly higher ingredient costs for the company, and it did not raise prices resulting from its move to non-GMO ingredients,\u201d the company said in a statement. The main reason for the potentially higher prices is the beef, Ells told the New York Times. \u201cWith pork, it\u2019s harder, because we only need one part of the animal \u2013 the shoulder \u2013 and the farmer needs to sell the whole animal to make it work,\u201d he said.",

      "body": "<p>Amid the general dim news about the end of the mining boom and the weakening of China came the announcement <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/chinas-required-reserve-ratio-cut-will-nudge-australia-along-40543\">last week</a> that the People\u2019s Bank of China would cut its required reserve ratio (RRR) for banks by one percentage point. </p> <p>This provided a brief moment of light for the mining sector as hopes grew that Chinese economic growth might stabilise. But it is also worth remembering that, while China will not again grow as fast as it did in the past decade, the size of its economy is now so large that it remains the economic behemoth that determines much of Australian\u2019s own economic fortunes.<br></p> <p>The RRR is the level of deposits Chinese banks must hold. The ratio is now 18.5%. While the cut in the RRR from the previous ratio of 19.5% is not the same as an interest rate cut \u2013 it doesn\u2019t for example change the interest rate at which borrowers have to pay \u2013 it does give Chinese banks the ability to lend more money. This does mean that Chinese monetary policy has been eased \u2013 and quite aggressively. The RRR was also cut by 50 basis points in February, and at the same time official Chinese interest rates were also cut \u2013 from 5.6% to 5.35%. </p> <p>Estimates <a href=\"http://www.afr.com/personal-finance/chinas-stimulus-positive-for-australian-resources-20150423-1mqqdt\">vary</a>, <a href=\"http://blogs.wsj.com/chinarealtime/2015/04/20/economists-react-chinas-aggressive-cut-in-banks-reserve-requirement-ratio/\">but economists</a> expect the move will see an additional 1 trillion to 1.5 trillion yuan (about $200bn-$300bn) into the Chinese banking system.

      "bodyText": "Amid the general dim news about the end of the mining boom and the weakening of China came the announcement last week that the People\u2019s Bank of China would cut its required reserve ratio (RRR) for banks by one percentage point. This provided a brief moment of light for the mining sector as hopes grew that Chinese economic growth might stabilise. But it is also worth remembering that, while China will not again grow as fast as it did in the past decade, the size of its economy is now so large that it remains the economic behemoth that determines much of Australian\u2019s own economic fortunes. The RRR is the level of deposits Chinese banks must hold. The ratio is now 18.5%. While the cut in the RRR from the previous ratio of 19.5% is not the same as an interest rate cut \u2013 it doesn\u2019t for example change the interest rate at which borrowers have to pay \u2013 it does give Chinese banks the ability to lend more money. This does mean that Chinese monetary policy has been eased \u2013 and quite aggressively. The RRR was also cut by 50 basis points in February, and at the same time official Chinese interest rates were also cut \u2013 from 5.6% to 5.35%. Estimates vary, but economists expect the move will see an additional 1 trillion to 1.5 trillion yuan (about $200bn-$300bn) into the Chinese banking system. And the expectation is that this will enable more investment in construction, which will in turn see a lift in demand for iron ore from Australia. We shouldn\u2019t get too excited about this extra stimulus, notes James Laurenceson, professor and deputy director of the Australia-China Relations Institute at University of Technology, Sydney, as it is the equivalent of only about one month\u2019s credit growth in the Chinese financial system.

We\u2019ll have to wait to see whether the rise in the iron ore price is just a dead cat bounce or the sign of the bottom having been reached, but certainly the Chinese residential housing market is in a much better place than it was nine to 12 months ago.
