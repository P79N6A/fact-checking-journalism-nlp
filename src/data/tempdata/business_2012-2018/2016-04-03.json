      "bodyText": "House prices in the London commuter belt fall by more than \u00a33,000 for every minute further away the property is by train from the capital, research has found. Savills estate agents researched property prices around 314 stations in places surrounding the capital on direct commuter lines into the city. It found that average property prices within half an hour\u2019s train ride from London were \u00a3458,000, compared with \u00a3606,000 in inner London. The cost of housing fell sharply to \u00a3337,000 for journeys of one hour to 69 minutes, with the saving averaging \u00a33,048 per minute, the study of Land Registry data found. The average property price in Beaconsfield, Buckinghamshire, which is within 29 minutes of central London by train, was \u00a31,010,000. The average price dropped to \u00a3929,000 for Sunningdale in Berkshire, which is nearly an hour away, and then by about a third for Great Shelford, near Cambridge, which is just over an hour away, to \u00a3622,000. The correlation between distance and price is uneven. The average property in Oxford, with its university, culture and second homes for City types, costs \u00a3730,000 for a 57-minute commute. It takes just 21 minutes to travel from the new town of Welwyn Garden City, but with few attractions to rival Oxford\u2019s, the average price is \u00a3430,000. Sophie Chick, who led the research for Savills, said: \u201cWhen you get to that point almost an hour from London, there are places like Cambridge, Oxford and Winchester, where prices go up again for those cities that \u2026 don\u2019t just rely on the commuter market.\u201d Chick said Savills\u2019 research was particularly pertinent because, after several years of rocketing London property values, prices in many towns surrounding London are now rising faster than in the capital. This means London families are increasingly cashing in for somewhere bigger and possibly cheaper in surrounding counties. In the first three months of this year, 30% of Savills\u2019 buyers in the commuter belt were moving from London, compared with 23% a year earlier. Chick said the trend was likely to continue. She said: \u201cWe\u2019ve been talking for so long about buyers moving out of London, but now we\u2019ve reached a turning point. When prices were going up at such a rate in London, it was easy for people to say: \u2018We\u2019ll sit tight before we move out,\u2019 but for a lot of people it\u2019s now the trigger to move.\u201d The trend has created new hotspots such as West Horndon in Essex, which is 32 minutes from Fenchurch Street station in the City. Prices there have risen 65% in the past five years, but are still a relatively modest \u00a3389,000 on average, Savills found. Average prices in Hassocks, 58 minutes from London Bridge on the Brighton line, have risen 36% in the past five years. For comparison, Brighton, a favourite destination for trendy Londoners moving out, has seen prices rise 28% in the same time. Chick said families making the move had to weigh up journey times, house prices, quality of life and the high cost of commuting in and out of London, but she said savings on house prices usually outweighed the increased travel costs. It costs almost \u00a310,000 a year to commute along the 83-minute journey from Newark Northgate, the survey\u2019s most northerly location, to London\u2019s King\u2019s Cross, but the average house price around the Nottinghamshire town is just \u00a3147,000.",

Amid criticism that official statistics fail to capture the full picture of Britain\u2019s modern economy, the Office for National Statistics has been planning to update its surveys to better measure the new ways people consume and trade goods and services. The ONS will publish on Tuesday a feasibility study into how it could measure the sharing economy, where people use online marketplaces and social networks to buy, swap and share assets such as rooms and cars, as well as services such as cleaning or business consultancy. A government-ordered review has called for the ONS to be more innovative and for economic statistics to be brought up to date. The ONS has been speaking to businesses and members of the public to establish how well the sharing economy is understood, aiming to add new questions to its surveys. The article on Tuesday will also explore how statisticians could better use data from the public sector and data from companies. In his review of official statistics published last month, the former Bank of England deputy governor Sir Charlie Bean estimated that if the digital economy was fully captured it could add as much as 0.75 percentage points to the UK\u2019s growth rate. Bean used the example of people booking holidays. In the past they may have paid a travel agent, bought a map or a guidebook and then paid to make calls home once on holiday. Now holidaymakers can make their own bookings online, use Google Maps once away and call home on WhatsApp or Skype. In other words, people are using services that are free or paid for by advertising rather than paid for by consumers, and methods of measuring the economy risk overlooking such free services. The review highlighted the rise of the sharing economy and noted that London has produced 72 sharing economy startups, the third largest number in the world, behind only San Francisco and New York. The economist Diane Coyle, known for her work on GDP figures, recently estimated that 3% of the UK workforce provided a service through the sharing economy. Her report with the trade body Sharing Economy UK (SEUK) said that while such activities were growing rapidly in the UK, it was impossible to track their contribution through official economic statistics. Ahead of the ONS study, SEUK\u2019s chair, Debbie Wosskow, said the UK must do more to accurately measure and \u201charness the power\u201d of the sharing economy to address its poor productivity record. \u201cWe welcome ONS\u2019 efforts to further recommend how the sharing economy can be measured \u2013 better data can and will make for a more informed policy debate. However, we need these recommendations to be followed with actions to ensure the UK remains the true home of the global sharing economy,\u201d said Wosskow, who is also founder of Love Home Swap, a home exchange company. In a nod to the growing importance of such online platforms, the government recently announced new tax breaks for money earned in the sharing economy. Intended to boost the number of \u201cmicro-entrepreneurs\u201d who make small amounts of money online, the tax allowances were unveiled by George Osborne in his March budget.",

Steve Rowe, who has spent more than 25 years working at the high street retailer, succeeded Marc Bolland on Saturday. He is due to present trading results to the City on Thursday. Rowe is already familiar with the M&amp;S clothing and homewares business as he has been in charge of general merchandise since last summer. Fashion retailers have reported a weak start to 2016, with analysts estimating clothing and homewares like-for-like sales at M&amp;S dropping more than 3% in its fourth quarter. Its food arm is expected to have eked out underlying sales growth of around 0.3% in the 13 weeks to 26 March. Rowe is not expected to give a detailed overview of his vision for M&amp;S until the company\u2019s full-year results in May. He stands to reap the benefits of his predecessor\u2019s multibillion-pound modernisation programme, which involved restructuring its warehousing and a new website. However, while the food business thrived under Bolland, the clothing business went downhill. Rowe\u2019s leadership could face headwinds after mid-market rival Next last week warned fashion retailers it could be facing the toughest trading conditions since the financial crisis in 2008, with Britons opting to spend spare cash on eating out and holidays rather than clothes. Despite concerns about a downturn, analysts at HSBC think M&amp;S\u2019s nascent recovery will accelerate under Rowe. \u201cWith the high-risk investment phase of the M&amp;S turnaround complete we expect the new chief executive to focus on a low-risk strategy based on better execution and commercial policy.\u201d \u201cWe expect greater focus on driving general merchandise top line growth via better product \u2026 improved product allocation and replenishment to store and where commercial to do so, margin investment in price.\u201d Under Bolland, M&amp;S also started an overhaul of how it buys clothing, cutting out middlemen and working with new suppliers, to improve profit margins. These gains are expected to buoy profits this year.

      "bodyText": "Last week should have been a good one for George Osborne. The first day of April marked the day when the \u201dnational living wage\u201d came into force. The idea was championed by the chancellor in his 2015 summer budget when he said it was time to \u201cgive Britain a pay rise\u201d. Unfortunately for the chancellor, the 50p an hour increase in the pay floor for workers over 25 was completely overshadowed by the existential threat to the steel industry posed by Tata\u2019s decision to sell its UK plants. Instead of being acclaimed by a grateful nation, Osborne found his handling of the economy under fire. The fact that official figures showed that Britain has the highest current account deficit since modern records began in 1948 did not help. At one level, all seems well with the economy. Growth was revised up for the fourth quarter of 2015 to 0.6% and is running at an annual rate of just over 2% \u2013 close to its long-term average and higher than in Germany, France or Italy. Two of three key sectors of the economy are struggling, though. Industrial production and construction have yet to recover the ground lost in the recession of 2008-09, leaving the economy dependent on services, which accounts for three-quarters of national output. Digging beneath the surface glitter shows just how unbalanced and unsustainable the economy has become. Growth is far too biased towards consumer spending. Borrowing is going up and imports are being sucked in. An enormous current account deficit and a collapse in the household saving ratio are usually consistent with the economy in the last stages of a wild boom rather than one trundling along at 2%. A little extra digging provides the explanation, with some alarming structural flaws quickly emerging. Here are two pieces of evidence. The first, relevant to the debate about the future of the steel industry, comes from an investigation by the left of centre thinktank, the IPPR, into the state of Britain\u2019s foundation industries. Foundation industries supply the basic goods \u2013 such as metal and chemicals \u2013 used by other industries. They have been having a tough time of it across the developed world, but the decline has been especially pronounced in the UK. Since 2000, the share of GDP accounted for by foundation industries has fallen by 21% across the rich nations that belong to the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development but by 43% in Britain. At the end of the 1990s, imports accounted for 40% of UK demand for basic metals; import penetration is now at 90%. Clearly, this trend will become even more marked if the Tata steel plants close. The second piece of evidence comes from a joint piece of research from the innovation foundation Nesta and the National Institute for Economic and Social Research being published on Monday. This found that productivity weaknesses are common across the sectors of the UK economy, but particularly marked among newly formed companies. Fledgling firms tend to be less efficient on average, but the report said that in the years since the recession performance had been unusually poor among startups. Since the economy emerged from recession, the growth of highly productive companies has been curbed and there has also been a slowdown in the number of under-performing businesses contracting in size. This helps explain why Britain has an 18% productivity gap with the other members of the G7 group of industrial nations. According to the economic orthodoxy that has prevailed for the past four decades, none of this should be happening. The theory was that a good, solid dose of market forces would clear out the dead wood from the manufacturing sector; financial deregulation would ensure that funding was provided to young, thrusting startup firms; and free trade would ensure that British industry remained on its toes. Industrial policy would no longer be about \u201cpicking winners\u201d but involve an open door to inward investment and low corporate taxes. This approach has proved a complete dud. Successive UK governments have allowed good companies to go to the wall for the sake of their free market principles. They have squandered the once-in-a-lifetime opportunity provided by North Sea oil to modernise and re-equip the manufacturing sector. They have sat back and watched as the economy has stumbled from one housing-driven boom-bust to another. They have now arrived at the stage where house price inflation is running at 10% a year; the current account deficit in the latest quarter was 7% a year; and manufacturing is in recession. The UK has been here before, although this time the numbers are scarier. Traditionally, what happens next is a sharp fall in the value of the pound, which helps rebalance the economy by making exports cheaper and imports dearer. Consumer spending takes a hit because goods cost more in the shops while manufacturers get a boost because their products are more competitive on world markets. Such a depreciation would almost certainly be triggered by a decision to leave the EU in the referendum on 23 June. The assumption is that this would be a bad thing; in truth, a cheaper currency would be one of the benefits of Brexit. But only in the right circumstances. There is more to rebalancing the economy and solving the UK\u2019s deep-seated problems than simply devaluing the pound. If it was as easy as that, Britain would be a world beater by now. Getting the right level for the pound is a necessary but not sufficient factor in putting the economy right. There is no shortage of ideas. Help for steel would be provided if procurement rules were tightened up so that contractors had to show they were sourcing sustainably, with the test being the impact on the environment and on local communities. The IPPR has a range of ideas for boosting foundation industries, including building stronger supply chains with advanced manufacturing and using the regional growth fund to provide more patient finance. Nesta said its research shows the need for better targeted support for new companies rather than blanket measures such as cuts in business rates. A new paper for the Fabian Society by the former Labour MP and leadership contender Bryan Gould believes there should be a twin-tracked approach: a 30% depreciation of the currency accompanied by a focus on credit creation for investment. This, he argues, could happen either through the existing banking system under the direction of the Bank of England or, if necessary, through a national investment bank. Gould says this is not about \u201cpicking winners\u201d but about setting the parameters for possible good investment opportunities. What links all these ideas is the belief that Britain needs a proper long-term industrial strategy. The prerequisite for that is an admission that the current model \u2013 low investment and competing on cost rather than quality \u2013 has failed, is failing and will continue to fail.",

    "webTitle": "Tata steel crisis: UK may offer sweeteners to tempt potential buyers", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The UK government is prepared to offer help with pension liabilities and energy costs to potential buyers of Tata\u2019s threatened steel plants, Sajid Javid, the business secretary, has said. Javid said the government wanted to find a buyer for the whole of Tata\u2019s UK business, including the Port Talbot steelworks, as he defended his handling of the crisis against accusations that ministers are letting the steel industry fail. After a week of intense criticism, the business secretary said he believed there was still time to find a buyer and the government was prepared to offer sweeteners. \u201cTata will issue an offer document very soon. Alongside that, the UK government know \u2013 I\u2019ve known for a while \u2013 that we\u2019re also going to have to offer support to clinch that buyer and give that steel plant a long-term, viable future,\u201d he said. He added: \u201cNo one is talking about nationalisation of pension schemes but it is something I absolutely recognise is a challenge.\u201d Javid has previously rejected nationalising Tata\u2019s steel plants but left the door open for the government to offer some sort of temporary bailout. \u201cI don\u2019t think nationalisation is a solution to this. Having said that, I also think it wouldn\u2019t be prudent to rule anything out at this stage, but I think that nationalisation is rarely an answer in these situations,\u201d he said. \u201cI do feel, though, for lots of reasons, after talking to Tata and many others involved in this, that there will be enough time to find the right buyer working with the government and being able to take this forward. We will look at everything we can do to allow a sale going ahead and I wouldn\u2019t rule anything out at this stage.\u201d Javid has been under pressure since Tata confirmed it was withdrawing from Port Talbot and other UK sites, threatening tens of thousands of jobs, while he was on a trade visit to Australia accompanied by his teenage daughter. Speaking on the BBC\u2019s Andrew Marr Show on Sunday, the business secretary acknowledged he had known for some weeks that Tata was considering pulling out of the UK. However, Javid said he pressed ahead with the trade trip because he had not anticipated Tata executives would make such a strong announcement after their critical board meeting in Mumbai. The business secretary has also been criticised for fighting to block the EU\u2019s lesser duty rule from protecting UK steel from cheap Chinese imports being dumped on the market. However, Javid insisted it was \u201cmisleading\u201d to suggest the UK had not done enough within the EU, highlighting a separate move to support higher tariffs on some steel products. John McDonnell, Labour\u2019s shadow chancellor, warned on the same programme that it could cost more than \u00a31bn in welfare benefits if the government allowed the steel industry to collapse. He said it was a mistake for the government to rule out nationalising the steel plants. \u201cIf we can find another buyer it\u2019s got to be not an asset-stripping job, we\u2019ve got to have some guarantees \u2013 keeping Port Talbot open for example,\u201d McDonnell said. \u201cIf we haven\u2019t got that leeway in the timescale, well then, as a fallback yes, nationalise in the short-term to stabilise the situation, prepare the sector, then before you look back out to another buyer. That would give us the stability that we need in this sector.\u201d On the BBC\u2019s Pienaar\u2019s Politics, Angela Eagle, the shadow business secretary, also attacked Javid and other ministers for taking a laissez-faire approach that amounted to \u201csit on your backside and let the whole thing go\u201d. EU rules prevent the UK from offering state support to its beleaguered steel industry but there could be ways to take on pension liabilities and offer relief for energy costs. A source close to Tata said it \u201ccould find a solution\u201d and potentially rescue the deal with German industrial conglomerate ThyssenKrupp if the UK government provided substantial financial support and restructured pension scheme, which has 130,000 members. ThyssenKrupp was in talks with Tata three months ago about buying Port Talbot and its other UK sites as part of a deal to buy its European business, including its other major steelworks in the Netherlands. However, the German company walked away owing to concerns about Tata\u2019s UK division losses and its pension liabilities of almost \u00a315bn.",

      "bodyText": "Driving in Moscow can be a hair-raising experience. The city suffers some of the worst congestion in the world and parking spaces are often impossible to find. But now, with the help of technology developed by a British company, drivers in the Russian capital can get ahead in the race to find a space. Along with St Petersburg and Minsk, the, Moscow is the location for a pilot project using technology from Telensa, a company based outside Cambridge, that can tell drivers exactly when and where a parking spot is vacant, saving numerous trips around the block. The technology behind the project is simple, says Tim Jackson, co-founder of the company. \u201cIt is a magnetic sensor which goes in the road. When the car parks over the top of it, it detects the car is there.\u201d There is a website that pinpoints the available spaces for drivers and electronic road signs also point them in the right direction. Telensa works in the development of \u201csmart cities\u201d, where technology is used to improve the running of an urban area. This includes everything from identifying which roads to grit when it snows, to turning on lights when police are pursuing a suspect. Central to this has been the company\u2019s development of smart streetlights. These can be controlled and monitored remotely, and was the first use of the technology now helping drivers in Moscow. Just over a decade ago, Jackson and his co-founder, Will Gibson, were looking for a use for the radio technology they had developed that communicated small amounts of information over long distances. Streetlights, which traditionally operated individually and were turned on and off by sensors, were ripe for innovation. The Ultra-Narrow-Band (UNB) technology developed allows local authorities to monitor lights remotely, using programmes to switch them on and off when required. The lights can be controlled as a group instantly with outages spotted from a distance. \u201c[Local authorities] can establish, for example, do they want the lights to come on in accordance with the following daylight or do they just want them on at a fixed time? Do they want to dim the lights in certain areas from 10pm to 5am or do they want maybe a deeper level of dimming but for fewer hours, maybe from 1am to 4am? It\u2019s all configurable by them,\u201d says Gibson, Telensa chief executive. The communications system uses nodes attached to the streetlights to control them \u2013 which in turn communicate with electronic base stations via UNB from up to 5 miles away. The base stations in turn communicate with the controller via a 3G dongle and the authorities can manipulate the lights as they want. Using this system, the lights can be dimmed at certain times to save energy \u2013 which some local authorities have used despite concern from motoring and pedestrian groups \u2013 or turn the lights on if there is a call from police about criminal activity. Local authorities can ascertain when lights are broken and can send out crews to fix them specifically instead of the historical system in which staff would manually carry out inspections at night and then other crews would be sent to fix them, says Gibson. The UK is a world leader in the field of smart lighting, he said, and 700,000 of the 7m streetlights across Britain are fitted with the Telensa technology. Essex county council uses the greatest number at 130,000 while there are also systems in Coventry, Sheffield and Birmingham. The company met success when streetlights were upgraded after a huge underspend from 1995 to 2005. Each node costs \u00a345, with networks consisting of 10,000 lights or more. It\u2019s all about the right light at the right time, says Gibson, saving energy and minimising waste. For example, a project in Doncaster with 33,000 streetlights, launched last year, will save \u00a31.3m each year from reduced energy consumption. It is the same fundamental technology the company now uses in systems to spot parking spaces. Other uses are also being developed, including systems which can detect a vehicle parking without permission in a residents\u2019 parking zone. \u201cIf you had a system which detected if someone had parked and had not paid and then the traffic warden would have an app which said: \u2018Bay five on such and such a street, there is someone who has parked and not paid.\u2019 He can go and put the ticket on. So you are reducing the costs of the enforcement,\u201d adds Jackson. Other uses include connecting sensors for weather monitoring, in which councils can detect more accurately which areas need to be gritted in snow storms, avoiding the cost of unnecessary gritting. In the UK, about one in five streetlights are smart, according to Gibson, through both Telensa technology and competitors. Trials have been carried out in Australia and Brazil, among other countries, while the US, where electric companies control millions of lights, is also a potentially lucrative market. In January, Telensa announced it had secured \u00a312.5m in venture capital from the Environmental Technologies Fund and the Silicon Valley Bank.",

    "webTitle": "Steel shrivels while Britain\u2019s balance of payments crisis grows", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "A record balance of payments deficit of \u00a396.2bn (5.2% of GDP) for 2015, and \u00a332.7bn (7% of GDP) for the fourth quarter alone \u2013 both higher in percentage terms than in any year since the second world war \u2013 and the first, instinctive reaction of the government is to let what is left of our steel industry go hang, so that imports can be boosted even further. These latest figures are horrifying in both cash terms and as a percentage of GDP. During the war, when this country was, economically, on its uppers, the balance of payments deficit reached some 10%, financed by the Lend Lease arrangements with Washington and by running down our overseas assets. Every schoolchild should know what happened after that: years of austerity, because our war-oriented productive capacity had slowly to be adapted to peacetime conditions and the expectations of the public for a recovery and improvement in living standards. This involved a succession of export drives so that we could, once again, \u201cpay our way\u201d in the world. It was Ed Balls, much maligned at the time but now increasingly highly regarded, who pointed out that the 2008-09 financial crisis had economic effects that were the peacetime equivalent of war. But, unlike the situation in 1945, we did not have a war-ravaged economy. We had an economy that had been plunged into recession by a banking crisis. As Balls argued in his seminal Bloomberg speech of August 2010, the last thing we needed, after the economy had begun to recover in response to the fiscal stimulus of 2009, was a policy of austerity. We needed to foster economic growth, and adopt policies that would alleviate a burgeoning balance of payments problem. When the Conservatives resumed what they regarded as their ancestral right \u2013 the keys to Nos 10 and 11 Downing Street \u2013 people like George Osborne would say that \u201cyou can\u2019t spend your way out of a recession\u201d. They would quote James Callaghan, who, in order to please the US administration and the IMF, said something similar when seeking an IMF loan in 1976. But Callaghan subsequently retracted that assertion in his memoirs, and was strongly critical of the deflationary monetarist policies of the early 1980s. When Cameron and Osborne arrived in office, they were obsessed with the wrong deficit. \u201cPaying our way in the world\u201d has precious little to do with the balance between public and private sector spending and everything to do with the balance of our overseas trade and payments. The parallel made by Balls with the impact of war should have alerted policymakers to the fact that it took decades for European nations to recover from the war. There was no need for the UK and others to rush to bring down their budget deficits after 2009. As it happens, many commentators are making great play with the fact that Osborne, while inflicting untold misery on vulnerable citizens with his mean-minded cuts, keeps missing those self-inflicted targets anyway. The crunch has now come with the impact the policy of austerity has had on business investment and the export sector, and hence on the balance of payments. Now, I am not saying for one moment that the blame for what is now manifestly a balance of payments crisis lies solely at the chancellor\u2019s door. The problems have been piling up ever since the Thatcher government\u2019s monetarist experiment with a sensationally overvalued exchange rate that inflicted serious damage on manufacturing. The damaging effects of an overvalued exchange rate continued, intermittently, under successive Conservative and Labour governments. Back in November 2002 Mervyn King said, at an Inflation Report press conference: \u201cWhat we\u2019ve seen is a weak net trade sector, offsetting a strong sector producing to meet domestic demand. I think in large part it is the consequence of a sharp rise in the real exchange rate, and what flowed from that.\u201d But this government\u2019s obsession with the wrong deficit has exacerbated a long-term problem, and brought things to a head. And the very idea of allowing such a strategic industry as steel to go down \u2013 quite apart from the social implications in south Wales \u2013 beggars belief. Here we come to some interesting parallels with the circumstances surrounding the June 1975 referendum. Then, as now, there was nervousness in the foreign exchange market as R-Day approached. But then it was less to do with the possibility of exit (\u201cBrexit\u201d had yet to be coined) as with a rise in inflation of 3.9% in one month, bringing the year-on-year figure to 21.7%. These days the monetary policy committee struggles to meet an inflation target of 2% for the whole year. Then, as now, there was growing concern about the balance of payments and the pound. Then came the 1976 IMF crisis, and an attempt to stem a fall in the pound that had first, in the words of Sir Douglas Wass, Treasury permanent secretary at the time, \u201cdeclined to fall\u201d and then fallen too much. The paradox now is that, patently absurd though the whole idea of Brexit is, fears about it have been unsettling the pound. Now we have the balance of payments crisis. I did not get where I am today forecasting exchange rates, but it is not inconceivable that circumstances are combining to bring the pound down to a more competitive level, and that, as in 1975-76, things could get completely out of hand.",

During the war, when this country was, economically, on its uppers, the balance of payments deficit reached some 10%, financed by the Lend Lease arrangements with Washington and by running down our overseas assets.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/mar/31/steel-crisis-builders-manufacturers-and-carmakers-urged-to-buy-british\">Steel crisis: builders, manufacturers and carmakers urged to buy British</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Every schoolchild should know what happened after that: years of austerity, because our war-oriented productive capacity had slowly to be adapted to peacetime conditions and the expectations of the public for a recovery and improvement in living standards. This involved a succession of export drives so that we could, once again, \u201cpay our way\u201d in the world.</p> <p>It was Ed Balls, much maligned at the time but now increasingly highly regarded, who pointed out that the 2008-09 financial crisis had economic effects that were the peacetime equivalent of war. But, unlike the situation in 1945, we did not have a war-ravaged economy. We had an economy that had been plunged into recession by a banking crisis. As <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2010/aug/27/ed-balls-coalition-spending-cuts\" title=\"\">Balls argued in his seminal Bloomberg speech</a> of August 2010, the last thing we needed, after the economy had begun to recover in response to the fiscal stimulus of 2009, was a policy of austerity. We needed to foster economic growth, and adopt policies that would alleviate a burgeoning balance of payments problem.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The crunch has now come with the impact austerity has had on business investment and the export sector</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>When the Conservatives resumed what they regarded as their ancestral right \u2013 the keys to Nos 10 and 11 Downing Street \u2013 people like George Osborne would say that \u201cyou can\u2019t spend your way out of a recession\u201d. They would quote James Callaghan, who, in order to please the US administration and the IMF, said something similar when seeking an IMF loan in 1976. But Callaghan subsequently retracted that assertion in his memoirs, and was strongly critical of the deflationary monetarist policies of the early 1980s.</p> <p>When Cameron and Osborne arrived in office, they were obsessed with the wrong deficit. \u201cPaying our way in the world\u201d has precious little to do with the balance between public and private sector spending and everything to do with the balance of our overseas trade and payments.</p> <p>The parallel made by Balls with the impact of war should have alerted policymakers to the fact that it took decades for European nations to recover from the war. There was no need for the UK and others to rush to bring down their budget deficits after 2009. As it happens, many commentators are making great play with the fact that Osborne, while inflicting untold misery on vulnerable citizens with his mean-minded cuts, keeps missing those self-inflicted targets anyway.</p> <p>The crunch has now come with the impact the policy of austerity has had on business investment and the export sector, and hence on the balance of payments.

Bolland (who is from Holland) has had mixed fortunes. Food and online sales are rising, debt has been cut and logistics simplified. But there isn\u2019t a changing-room curtain thick enough to hide the group\u2019s threadbare performance in fashion. One memorable effort to arrest the decline saw Bolland enlist the services of compatriot Marcel Wanders. That designer\u2019s idiosyncratic offering included red leather gloves with one gold-tipped finger. That one didn\u2019t exactly chime with the tastes of the loyal M&amp;S clientele. Predecessor Stuart Rose was a hard act to follow, but such was the M&amp;S remuneration committee\u2019s confidence in Bolland that they handed him a \u00a315m pay package, including a bumper \u00a33.9m signing-on fee. Six years on and M&amp;S seems no closer to winning back the hearts and wallets of clothes shoppers, particularly in women\u2019s fashion. Poor results have been blamed on factors such as weather that was either too wet or too warm, depending on the season. Steve Rowe, Bolland\u2019s anointed heir, has been in charge of fashion since last summer. A trading update that features some good news on that front would help him come flying off the blocks. Will Flood Re help to bail out the politicians? Flood Re, a not-for-profit scheme aimed at making home insurance affordable for people who live in flood-prone areas, comes into force on Monday after regulators gave it the all-clear. The partnership between government and industry is a response to the anguish and devastation experienced during the winter\u2019s record rainfall by politicians forced to visit flood-hit areas and look concerned while wearing wellies. Under the scheme, Flood Re will take on the flood risk element of home insurance in return for insurers paying a premium based on the property\u2019s council tax band. This will be partly funded by a \u00a3180m levy on the insurance industry. When claims are made, the insurers will in turn be able to claim from Flood Re. The government expects that around 350,000 homes will eventually be covered, although not all insurers are taking part. Axa says it will be \u201cproactive\u201d about informing its own customers of the scheme but points out that reinsurance is no substitute for things like flood defences and \u201cof course, the cessation of construction on flood plains\u201d. Shadows lengthen as service sector slows The last health check on growth in the UK\u2019s dominant service sector, which includes everything from hotels and pubs to insurance and financial advice, made for grim reading. The Markit/Cips purchasing managers index (PMI) for services, released in early March, showed that the sector is experiencing its slowest pace of expansion since March 2013. Given that the catch-all service category now accounts for about 80% of the UK economy, that\u2019s a worrying sign. The result has also pushed back expectations for when the Bank of England would raise interest rates from the record low of 0.5% set in March 2009. Another lacklustre performance when the latest PMI data is released on Tuesday would give real cause for concern that the UK\u2019s recovery from the financial crisis is running out of momentum. Growth in manufacturing has also been subdued \u2013 and even if it hadn\u2019t been, the sector is simply too small to take up the slack. This time last month, Markit said uncertainty over Brexit, as well as global economic volatility, was among the factors subduing the index. There is no reason to think that any of those worries will have diminished in the course of a month.",
