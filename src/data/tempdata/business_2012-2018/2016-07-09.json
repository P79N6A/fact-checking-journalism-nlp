      "bodyText": "Bank of England governor Mark Carney faces his second test since the EU referendum this week after calming markets with his promise to underpin the banking system with an extra \u00a3150bn of backstop funds. On Thursday he will join the other eight members of the central bank\u2019s monetary policy committee (MPC), which sets the UK\u2019s interest rate, and ask: is this a time to push up rates to stifle a possible surge in inflation or the moment to cut them as the economy appears to falter? Andrew Sentence, a former member of the MPC, says there is not enough hard evidence to move either way. The economic adviser to accountants PwC says it would be much better to wait and see. But Carney has hinted strongly that he is minded to cut rates after a frantic two weeks that have seen the pound tumble to a 31-year low. Most City economists expect a rate cut by August, believing that the UK economy is already on the ropes after a slowdown going back to at least last summer \u2013 and the markets are expecting it after Carney\u2019s comments. They want some action to offset the lack of decision-making in Westminster while the Tories choose a leader and Labour contemplates ousting Jeremy Corbyn. Jonathan Loynes, chief European economist at Capital Economics, said the committee will recognise the dangers of disappointing market expectations and cut bank rate by 0.25% before restarting its quantitative easing programme in August. \u201cThe outlook for monetary policy, like the economy, is highly uncertain. But the MPC has ammunition to cushion the impact of the Brexit vote. It should not hesitate to use it,\u201d he said. Against this challenging backdrop, what is the financial and economic outlook for the UK? The pound Sterling slumped to a 31-year-low of $1.28 last week before settling at just under $1.30, having stood at $1.50 on the day of the referendum, and $1.57 last year. Holger Schmieding, chief economist at Berenberg bank, says that the current uncertainty has driven away foreign investors, reducing the demand for sterling. He says the pound\u2019s fall has stopped for the moment, but it could start again if the current political uncertainty continues. Unlike Tory leadership candidate Andrea Leadsom, he denies that a cheaper currency automatically boosts exports. \u201cIt will be limited,\u201d he says, pointing to the failure of exports to gain any traction after the 2008 financial crisis when the pound lost 20% of its value. Instead, imports become more expensive, pushing up the average price of goods in the shops. Two straws in the wind are the Chinese computer maker Lenovo, which has hinted prices are set to rise. And higher cocoa import costs are putting pressure on chocolate makers to raise prices. Mohamed El-Erian, chief economic adviser to Allianz, Europe\u2019s largest insurer, said: \u201cThink of sterling as facing a double whammy with no strong anchor.\u201d The UK\u2019s balance of payments deficit of 7%, the largest in the G7, is one of the problems which he highlights. It shows that Britain has been living beyond its means for some time. The lack of Bank of England firepower is another problem. In times past, Threadneedle Street would increase interest rates to protect the pound from going into freefall, but that option is no longer open. Near-zero interest rates are the only thing keeping the economy moving. \u201cIt is not inconceivable for sterling to head to parity with the dollar over the coming months,\u201d El-Erian said. The markets The FTSE 100 is higher than it was in the days before the referendum, giving the appearance of calm at the result. The index, which measures the value of London\u2019s 100 largest listed firms, was hovering at 6591 on Friday, well above the 6338 seen before the vote. However, the gains mask huge falls in the share prices of banks and housebuilders, which took a beating as investors feared a post-Brexit property crash. Insurers have also closed their property investment funds to withdrawals to stem the flow of redemptions. There was also cause for concern in the FTSE 250 index of medium-sized firms, which stood at 17333 before the vote and finished last week at 16198, down almost 10%. The FTSE 250 is almost quaintly British, with most making sales in sterling. For these companies the fall in the currency means they become less valuable whereas the generally larger, multinational firms in the FTSE 100, which earn most of their revenues abroad in dollars, climb in value. Members of the MPC are therefore likely to discount the good news and focus on the underlying weaknesses. And they know that the apparently stable situation can only be celebrated by Brexiters because of the intervention the Bank of England and the European Central Bank, which signalled after the vote that they stood ready to loosen monetary policy further in the event of a panic. Manufacturing According to industry figures for June, car sales dropped for only the second time in more than four years. This was widely seen as a sign that consumers, concerned about the outcome of the referendum vote, were feeling less confident about spending money on big-ticket items. The knock for the usually buoyant car market came after UK factory output made only tentative gains in June. The rise, which followed a slump in the spring, failed to prevent firms shedding more jobs. Siemens, which has just opened a \u00a3310m manufacturing hub in Hull that employs 1,000 people, warned new windpower investment plans were on hold. Many other big employers have voiced their concerns about the impact on investment of Britain moving out of the EU. Manufacturing output is still around 8% below its 2008 peak and employs many fewer people than before the financial crash, so it needs all the investment it can get. The core sectors covering aerospace, cars, pharmaceuticals and machine-tool manufacturing remain the UK\u2019s strengths, and the resurgence of activity in the eurozone this year has seen a steady rise in exports to the UK\u2019s main trading partner. Rob Dobson, senior economist at financial data providers Markit, said the export sector remained tough. Exports fell in May and the low pound may generate more uncertainty, especially in the eurozone, than it does extra sales. Construction Builders are wary of another property crash after almost being wiped out in 2008. This sensitivity means the industry, in any country, acts as an early warning system for an impending recession. For last six months firms have put new projects on hold and concentrated on those already under construction. A skills shortage across the sector has also encouraged them to batten down the hatches rather than take on extra costs. Commercial developers, which build office blocks, shopping centres and factories, followed suit believing rightly that their dependence on foreign investors meant they were more exposed to a period of recession. Not surprisingly construction-sector shares have been among the worst hit on the stock market since 23 June, with some firms losing a quarter of their value. Cast out of the EU, many firms fear the UK will suffer slower economic growth and mothballed projects will stay under wraps while immigration restrictions will make recruiting skilled staff more difficult. Services The UK\u2019s myriad service industries, which make up more than 75% of the national economy, have supplied almost all the country\u2019s growth over the last five years and helped to offset a huge deficit in the balance of trade in goods. The most recent figures from the Markit/CIPS purchasing managers index show activity levels at 52.3 \u2013 the lowest rating for three years \u2013 as new business weakened and firms used their spare capacity to tackle backlogs. The index indicates growth when it rises above 50. For the last two years economists have feared that UK businesses have relied on domestic consumers to spend their savings and borrow to fund purchases. Wage rises averaging 2% and almost zero inflation have also increased the level of disposable incomes. The recent fall in the pound is expected to increase inflation, bringing to an end this brief period of improving living standards. A shallow recession is expected to follow. Services companies are likely to take a small fall in national income in their stride and, like most businesses, believe that when the Conservative party elects a new leader in September (possibly earlier) and adopts a clear strategy for leaving the EU, the period of uncertainty will ease. El-Erian said that much depended on whether politicians were able to provide a credible and swift \u201cPlan B\u201d that included a free trade agreement with the EU. \u201cAfter the Brexit referendum, the UK has to urgently get its political act together,\u201d he said. \u201cPlan B depends on the politicians in London and across the Channel, but so far they have not stepped up to their economic governance responsibilities.\u201d",

Paid for by Germany\u2019s FDP party, it looked more like a marketing stunt to raise the profile of an ailing political group than anything to do with Berlin\u2019s digital economy. But the van is only one of several measures aimed at luring startups from London to the German capital. As the Observer has learned, Berlin\u2019s senate has written to hundreds of business headquartered in London over the course of the past week to persuade them to switch their operations overseas, as well as making plans for a bureau in the UK capital designed to poach business from the local startup community, expected to open in September. The Berlin senate is also warning London-based venture capital funds that unless they relocate their headquarters, they stand to lose out on money from the European Investment Fund (EIF) once Britain formally leaves the EU. Last year, the UK benefited to the tune of \u20ac655.8m (\u00a3559m) from EIF coffers. \u201cWe want to make sure that British startups and international talent feel welcome here,\u201d says Cornelia Yzer, Berlin\u2019s senator for the economy, technology and development. \u201cBrits already love Berlin \u2013 we see that from the number of people who travel here every weekend. We will continue to receive them with open arms.\u201d With Berlin\u2019s startup scene already having overtaken London\u2019s in terms of venture capital investment in 2014, policymakers in the German capital feel emboldened. They argue that their city offers a pool of talented international developers who may avoid Britain once curbs on migration are applied, commercial rents that are about a third of those in London, and \u2013 not unimportant for a young, creative industry \u2013 a better party scene. With Germany having a strong network of large manufacturers, as well as research bodies such as the Fraunhofer and Max Planck institutes, Berlin already has an edge over London when it comes to startups that specialise in business-to-business services. And while London remains Europe\u2019s capital of \u201cfintech\u201d \u2013 or financial services technology \u2013 many companies will be nervously watching to see whether the UK can retain its \u201cpassporting\u201d privileges, which allow a bank to operate in all European countries so long as it has a licence from an EU member state. Some financial startups such as Chicken Financial, a small specialist lender, have already accelerated their expansion to the German capital after the Brexit vote. \u201cFor us, it\u2019s a risk diversification strategy,\u201d says co-founder Samuel Ely. \u201cWe expect there will be a long-term shift of fintech and banking from Frankfurt to Berlin and that Berlin could eventually become continental Europe\u2019s new financial capital.\u201d Reservations about whether Berlin can provide a more fruitful ecosystem for Europe\u2019s digital economy than London still remain, however \u2013 even inside the German capital. Many young entrepreneurs in the city complain that while it is relatively easy to start a company in Germany, shutting down a business can take a long time. Unlike in Britain, a company\u2019s books have to be kept open for three to five years after it has been removed from the trade register to make sure taxes and personal liabilities are fully cleared \u2013 a measure that some companies circumvent by relocating to other EU countries, like Spain, and shutting it down there instead. Travis Todd, founder of Silicon Allee, a website for Berlin\u2019s startup community, says he has three dormant companies he has been trying to shut down for years. \u201cIt\u2019s a major headache, and it makes people more reluctant to start their next company.\u201d Many startups complain that Berlin\u2019s local tax offices don\u2019t differentiate between small businesses and large corporations. Yzer says the city is in discussions about setting up a special startup unit across finance ministries that would smoothen the process for the digital economy. While the German capital has Berlin Partner \u2013 a widely praised agency that helps newly arrived international businesses navigate the quirks of local bureaucracy, and assists with anything from visa applications to flat-hunting \u2013 other bodies such as Germany\u2019s chamber of commerce still communicate exclusively in German. \u201cBerlin is a brilliant ecosystem for startups, but I am not sure it\u2019s the result of policy. We tend to tell new arrivals: don\u2019t wait for help from the government, just do your own thing,\u201d says Todd. In London, Berlin\u2019s overtures have not yet caused a panic. Harry Briggs, a partner at venture capital company BGF Ventures, says that Berlin remains an \u201calso-ran\u201d as a startup hub compared with London, while Rob Moffat, a partner at investment firm Balderton Capital, says he doesn\u2019t expect many larger companies to relocate any time soon. \u201cMost people have other halves and there is not much work in Berlin for them unless they are in startups or government,\u201d he says. \u201cI do expect more young single British founders to start their company in Berlin, for the low cost of living and easy access to the rest of Europe. But I don\u2019t expect an exodus.\u201d Gerard Grech, chief executive of Tech City UK, the body set up by the UK government to foster east London\u2019s tech scene, says he is \u201clistening to the community and will be informing government on the policies that need to be put into action. \u201cTo startups that may consider relocating, the message is simple \u2013 nothing has changed\u201d, Grech says. \u201cWe are confident that further initiatives and policies will continue to evolve to ensure London stays a global tech powerhouse.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Brexit looms over David Cameron\u2019s visit to this week\u2019s Farnborough air show, as airlines and plane manufacturers fasten their belts for a bumpy few years of economic turbulence. The prime minister is scheduled to visit the show on Monday, and assurances about Britain\u2019s future trading links with the rest of the world, including the European Union, are sure to be near the top of the agenda. The biennial aerospace jamboree is usually peppered with eyecatching orders for the latest jetliners, which provide a handy barometer of global economic confidence. Sir Richard Branson\u2019s Virgin Atlantic looks set to sign a $4.3bn deal to buy up to 12 A350 wide-bodied jets from Airbus, while the European plane maker\u2019s American rival, Boeing, will confirm an order for around 10 747 jumbo jets with Russia\u2019s largest air freight company, worth about $4bn. These marquee deals will be trumpeted loudly. But, after several years of bumper plane orders, analysts reckon the atmosphere among captains of the aero industry and their sales executives will be relatively muted as worries grow about the state of the global economy in the wake of the UK\u2019s vote to leave the EU. One analyst said: \u201cA sudden ripple has gone through the market after Brexit. We\u2019ve got no idea about the impact of Brexit at the moment.\u201d Industry sources expect Branson to attend this week\u2019s show to sign the Airbus deal. It is thought Virgin wants to buy eight A350-1000 jetliners and take purchase options on a further four to replace its remaining Boeing 747s. Craig Kreeger, chief executive of Virgin Atlantic, last month said that a decision on the new jets was \u201cimminent\u201d. The deal might enable Virgin to cancel its now-unwanted order for Airbus\u2019s A380 superjumbo. Several other airlines are in the final stages of choosing between the A350 and its rival, Boeing\u2019s 787 Dreamliner, including Emirates and Oman Air. European airlines are expected to have a quiet show. The uncertainty that has enveloped the EU since Britain voted to leave has already sparked profit warnings from British carriers such as easyJet and International Airlines Group, owner of British Airways. In addition, a low oil price has not only eased the financial burden on carriers, but has also curbed their need to buy new fuel-efficient planes to replace ageing fleets. Tom Enders, chief executive of Airbus, has warned the EU vote was \u201ca lose-lose result\u201d for Britain and Europe. His view matters because Airbus makes all of its wings at Broughton in north Wales. \u201cBritain will suffer, but I\u2019m sure it will focus even more now on the competitiveness of its economy vis-a-vis the EU and the world at large,\u201d Enders said, warning: \u201cBut of course we will review our UK investment strategy, like everybody else will.\u201d Airbus goes into this week\u2019s show lagging behind its arch-rival, after ending the first half of the year with 227 aircraft orders, or 183 after deducting cancellations. Boeing sold 309 aircraft, or 276 after cancellations. The figures clearly show demand for aircraft falling compared with the first half of last year, which included the Paris air show, held every other year in June. In 2015, Airbus booked 1,036 net commercial plane orders, down from 1,456 a year earlier, but it outsold Boeing, which booked 768 net orders last year. Boeing has lost ground to its European rival in the giant market for short-haul planes. There is talk that the US company is honing designs for a mid-range plane seating between 200 and 270 people to whisk passengers from London to New York, Sydney to Shanghai or Dubai to Oslo. The mid-market jetliner would fill the gap between Boeing\u2019s largest single-aisle model, the 737, and its smallest wide-body, the 787. It is a relatively untapped market but one where Airbus is starting to extend its reach. Mike Delaney, general manager of aircraft development at Boeing, recently said it was a case of \u201cwhen\u201d, not \u201cif\u201d, regarding the prospects for a new plane. He is confident Boeing is on the verge of a breakthrough, following discussions with 36 carriers about a replacement for the out-of-production 757. The aircraft would cost at least $10bn to produce and Boeing\u2019s top brass want to ensure the economics stack up before giving it the green light. They are keen to avoid a repeat of the mistakes made with the Dreamliner, its last major new design. Boeing racked up nearly $30bn in deferred costs on the 787, which was plagued with production problems.",

      "bodyText": "Marie Antoinette famously had sheep perfumed and dyed cheerful colors for her amusement. Modern wealthy urbanites, lacking space for livestock, can now do that to their dogs. As ever increasing numbers of people see their dogs as children, everything from luxury clothing brands for dogs to baby carriages specifically made for a tot of the four-legged variety have sprung up. So it is perhaps not surprising that the boom in spending on pet care, estimated at $62bn for 2016 in the US, has now also spawned luxury pet hotels. D Pet Hotels, a luxury dog hotel and spa franchise that offers cologne and doggy dye jobs, among other services, started 10 years ago. The business is thriving, with three locations in the US and a fourth set to open soon. The hotels are modeled on the human variety and don\u2019t see themselves as boarding kennels, which becomes apparent the moment you walk in. Enter the airy lobby of the Chelsea location in Manhattan and you are greeted by the sight of an ornate pink plastic throne, next to which hangs a large reproduction of a painting of Chelsea Handler\u2019s dog. \u201cPeople see the throne on Instagram and want to come in and take pictures with it,\u201d said Kerry Brown, owner of the Chelsea location. A composed, slender blonde woman in yoga pants and a D Pet Hotels staff black T-shirt, Brown was a marketing executive for another high-end company, Lululemon, maker of the $98 yoga pant, before deciding she missed the thrill of entrepreneurship. About four years ago, she bought into the D Pet Hotels franchise with her husband, opening the New York City location. D Pet Hotels is aimed at the dual-income households that want a step above the usual boarding experience for their fur baby. At the Scottsdale, Arizona, location, clients are known to fly their dogs to the hotel in a private jet, Brown says. At the flagship Hollywood location, it\u2019s all about flashy cars such as Porsches, Bentleys and Rolls Royces, with the hotel offering chauffeured pick up in style. Here in Manhattan, where such displays would raise eyebrows, it\u2019s a discreet black town car that is sent to pick up Fido, or more often a simple walk from a few blocks away, explains Brown. Occasionally, a Ferrari or a Lamborghini is hired to make a curbside drop-off when clients ask for it, she adds. The hotel offers standard daycare and grooming services, but it\u2019s the little extras that really catch the eye. Dogs that stay overnight get their own rooms, complete with a bed, toys and their own flat screen TV. Soothing music is sometimes piped into the premises. Room service is at 7am and 6pm, Brown says. No word on whether the dogs get a mint on their pillows. The rooms range in size from a generous walk-in closet for $84 a night to a full-sized bedroom complete with an Ikea bed, for $200 a night, with each dog\u2019s toys arranged on the bed and carefully labeled with their names. \u201cWe have had parents in the lobby who cry over a yellow tennis ball,\u201d explains Brown, so the hotel makes sure no one loses a beloved toy during their stay. The spa on premises provides an entire menu above and beyond the standard bath and a haircut. If your dog never got over the demise of punk, the spa offers dog mohawks, complete with dog safe gel. If your dog has gotten in on the nail art trend, the spa offers \u201cpawdicures\u201d, with dog safe nail polishes and even little diamond appliques, attached to each nail. One white dog comes in to get dyed hot pink at the spa. \u201cIt\u2019s a hoot,\u201d says Brown. But most people opt for a simpler service, like the wash and trim they offer specifically for dogs who will be attending a dinner party that night and need to look their best, says Brown. A spritz with a dog safe cologne is also offered, though disappointingly, the cologne is made to appeal to noses of the human variety. After dogs are sorted by size and temperament, they are placed in three rooms with rubberized floors where the dogs socialize with each other. Toys or special treats are forbidden, because they might make dogs aggressive. Instead the dogs get one staff member per 20 dogs and the freedom to bark to their hearts\u2019 contentment. While the hotel offers two relief walks per day as part of its nightly rate, the dogs are encouraged to go to the bathroom on the rubberized floor of the play pens, which can be a jarring sight. Staff follow them around with bags and mops soaked in an antiseptic cleaner for immediate clean up. Should you want to experience some of the more upscale services with your dog, the hotel offers occasional \u201cmommy and me\u201d style exercise classes. There are also \u201cbikini body workouts\u201d, doga, meditation and massage, all designed to incorporate your dog. If you feel like your dog can\u2019t keep up with your intense exercise routine, there are tiny dog treadmills available and staff willing to provide the bribes and encouragement needed to get dogs to walk on them. Some dogs come to the hotel just for daycare, living a latchkey kid existence, while others board overnight when parents need to get away from the city. On holidays all 57 rooms at the hotel, including the $200 a night \u201cUber Suites\u201d, tend to fill up, while on regular weekdays, 40 to 50 dogs come to play in the rubberized playpens. What dogs think of as luxury is probably different from the human idea and whether painting your dog\u2019s nails or giving him a mohawk is actually a good idea is debatable. According to Brian Hare, Professor of Cognitive Neuroscience at Duke University and author of The Genius of Dogs, \u201cNail polish, perfume, and soothing music hopefully don\u2019t hurt the dog, but if you really want to make a dog happy, a good old fashioned belly rub is the way to do it.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "One should have thought that in the production of Richard III at Islington\u2019s Almeida theatre on the night the referendum results were declared, the cast would have relished the following exchange: Richard: What news abroad? Hastings: No news so bad abroad as this at home. As we were reeling from the referendum result, this exchange would surely have brought the house down. But it didn\u2019t. They left out the second line, and the opportunity was missed. Or perhaps it was deliberate. What a shame. The subsequent outbreak of knifing among the Goves and Johnsons of this world makes the gory plot of Richard III look like a vicarage tea party. As the comedian Terry-Thomas would have said, these so called senior Tories are \u201can absolute shower\u201d. They deserve every unguarded remark Kenneth Clarke makes about them. What a tragedy it all is! Buffoons at the top of the Conservative party and the man who ought to have been leader years ago, namely Clarke, ostracised because, unlike the egregious Johnson and Gove, he is true to his European principles. As the Roman poet Juvenal opined at a certain farcical juncture in the affairs of his city state: Difficile est non saturam scribere (It is difficult not to write satire). Indeed, the mood among my fellow Remainers seems to be evolving from depression to black humour. It was none other than Rupert Harrison, former economic adviser to George Osborne, who recently remarked that the people may have spoken but \u2013 did they know what they have said? For sheer chutzpah I can think of few things more farcical than the statement by Kelvin MacKenzie, former editor of the Sun, that even he was suffering from \u201cbuyer\u2019s remorse\u201d and regretted having voted Leave. Can this be the same man who spent his time as editor poisoning the minds of his readers with constant attacks on the EU and Brussels? Surely there must have been some mistake. Again, during David Cameron\u2019s last supper with European leaders in Brussels the other week, our prime minister complained that if the others had offered him an \u201cemergency brake\u201d on the inflow of migrants, the result might have been different. To which Jean-Claude Juncker made the eminently reasonable point: \u201cIf you, over years or decades, tell citizens that something is wrong with the EU \u2013 that the EU is too technocratic, too bureaucratic \u2013 you cannot be taken by surprise if voters believe you.\u201d As for Nigel Farage, a man whose nasty campaign can hardly be unconnected with a sharp increase in hate crime since the vote \u2013 can this be the same populist hoodlum who maintained that, if it went 52% to 48% against Brexit, then there should be another referendum, because such a momentous decision could surely not be taken on such a narrow majority? Which brings us to a brilliant article in the current issue of Prospect, by the economist Anatole Kaletsky. Kaletsky takes issue with the way so many of the establishment seem to have caved in without a fight in the face of a referendum whose result even the former editor of the Sun objects to. He makes many points that I cannot cover here, one of the key ones being that it is absurd to maintain that it is undemocratic to question the result. As he explains, from the very moment of a general election result, it is the duty of the opposition to carry on the attack. Kaletsky argues that the implications of Brexit are so calamitous that it makes sense for a genuine effort on the part of the UK and the rest the EU to come to an accommodation on immigration and the single market, and then put it to parliament. An obvious factor behind the hope that there will be a change of heart among the electorate is that the damage of Brexit is already becoming apparent. Contracts are being put on hold all over the place and the panic in the City is so great that investors are not being allowed to withdraw their money from prestigious funds. I have seldom known such an atmosphere of fear and apprehension in postwar Britain. The Chilcot report concludes that the intelligence behind the invasion of Iraq was faulty and there was no plan for the aftermath. In this case there was certainly no plan; but there was also no intelligence. In the film The Dark Knight, the Michael Caine character says: \u201cSome men just want to watch the world burn.\u201d The collapse of the pound has only begun, and is in danger of going well beyond what our trading competitiveness might require. And if Brexit goes ahead, any competitive gains are likely to be dwarfed by the impact on investment from multinationals that, until now, have seen the UK as a base for operations within the single market. The governor of the Bank of England \u2013 who is, as it were, doing a sterling job trying to keep the show on the road \u2013 recently quoted A Streetcar Named Desire about dependence on \u201cthe kindness of strangers\u201d. He was referring to the financing of our vast current balance of payments deficit. When the longer-term implications of losing the single market sink in, those strangers may not be so kind. We urgently need to recognise that a huge mistake has been made. Meanwhile, let us remember that David Cameron came into politics to \u201cmake a difference\u201d. He succeeded.",

Kaletsky takes issue with the way so many of the establishment seem to have caved in without a fight in the face of a referendum whose result even the former editor of the <em>Sun </em>objects to.</p> <p>He makes many points that I cannot cover here, one of the key ones being that it is absurd to maintain that it is undemocratic to question the result. As he explains, from the very moment of a general election result, it is the duty of the opposition to carry on the attack.</p> <p>Kaletsky argues that the implications of Brexit are so calamitous that it makes sense for a genuine effort on the part of the UK and the rest the EU to come to an accommodation on immigration and the single market, and then put it to parliament.</p> <p>An obvious factor behind the hope that there will be a change of heart among the electorate is that the damage of Brexit is already becoming apparent. Contracts are being put on hold all over the place and the panic in the City is so great that investors are not being allowed to withdraw their money from prestigious funds.</p> <p>I have seldom known such an atmosphere of fear and apprehension in postwar Britain. The Chilcot report concludes that the intelligence behind the invasion of Iraq was faulty and there was no plan for the aftermath. In this case there was certainly no plan; but there was also no intelligence. In the film <em>The Dark Knight</em>, the Michael Caine character says: \u201cSome men just want to watch the world burn.\u201d</p> <p>The collapse of the pound has only begun, and is in danger of going well beyond what our trading competitiveness might require. And if Brexit goes ahead, any competitive gains are likely to be dwarfed by the impact on investment from multinationals that, until now, have seen the UK as a base for operations within the single market.</p> <p>The governor of the Bank of England \u2013 who is, as it were, doing a sterling job trying to keep the show on the road \u2013 recently quoted <em>A Streetcar Named Desire</em> about dependence on \u201cthe kindness of strangers\u201d. He was referring to the financing of our vast current balance of payments deficit. When the longer-term implications of losing the single market sink in, those strangers may not be so kind.</p> <p>We urgently need to recognise that a huge mistake has been made. Meanwhile, let us remember that David Cameron came into politics to \u201cmake a difference\u201d. He succeeded.</p>",
