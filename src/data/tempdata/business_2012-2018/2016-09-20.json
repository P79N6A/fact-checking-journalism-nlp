      "bodyText": "Primetime TV programmes such as The Great British Bake Off and Game of Thrones have helped fuel a boom in \u201cdual-screening\u201d by consumers \u2013 watching television while simultaneously browsing and shopping online \u2013 new research has revealed. Reinforcing the ongoing \u201cBake Off effect\u201d on retail sales, shoppers are snapping up specialist bakeware such as tins and cookie cutters from the comfort of their sofas via their laptop, tablet or smartphone during the programme, according to online marketplace eBay. The data is published as part of eBay\u2019s first UK retail report, published to coincide with its 21st anniversary. The report provides a snapshot of the way the UK bids, buys and sells, with a focus on the rise of the dual-screening phenomenon. The findings are based on all eBay UK\u2019s sales and search data over the last year, based on the habits of the over 19 million Britons who visit eBay every month. According to Ofcom, two-thirds of people own a smartphone, using it for nearly two hours every day to browse the internet, access social media, bank and shop online. Using minute-by-minute data information and by breaking down user activity by device, eBay has tracked shopper behaviour at precise TV moments \u2013 including live broadcasts and in the weeks following box set releases. During the season 7 premiere of The Great British Bake Off in August, eBay saw a 67% rise in consumer interest in baking products while the show was on air, soaring to 133% during the hour immediately afterwards. The programme, now one of the most popular in the UK \u2013 although switching from the BBC to Channel 4 for the next series \u2013 has sparked a boom in the art of home baking and a nationwide consumer fascination with soggy bottoms and fancy biscuits. Such is the power of the Bake Off effect over sales that the UK\u2019s supermarkets and retailers spared no expense in making sure they were fully geared up to meet demand as the new series kicked off. Of other TV blockbusters, eBay UK recorded a sixfold increase in searches for Game of Thrones merchandise \u2013 box sets, books and branded T-shirts, mugs and even jewellery \u2013 on the day after the season 6 finale aired, with 71% of these via mobile. Following Team GB\u2019s 11 cycling track medals at the Rio Olympics, exercise bikes and Brompton bicycles were two of the fastest-rising search trends on the site, with Bromptons viewed more than 110,000 times during the remainder of August. Even merchants selling tweed flat caps have enjoyed a fillip thanks to the success of the drama Peaky Blinders. Following the season 3 premiere on 5 May 2016, sales of flat caps (as worn by Cillian Murphy\u2019s character, the Birmingham gangster Thomas Shelby) tripled in volume, with demand remaining strong throughout the series. \u201cPrimetime television breaks have long been the gold standard in advertising, with millions spent on ads that air during some of the nation\u2019s favourite programmes,\u201d said Murray Lambell, the director of UK trading at eBay. \u201cOur trends report demonstrates the power that popular shows have in and of themselves \u2013 as evidenced by the sudden burst of flat cap sales we experienced during Peaky Blinders, or the baking interest seen throughout GBBO.\u201d The retailer said that each series of GBBO had sparked an average of 45% sales increase for one of its sellers, Yolli Kitchenware. Yolli director, Richard Loynds, said: \u2018We first decided to start selling baking products when we noticed more and more people were buying our lollipop sticks to make \u2018cake pops\u2019 \u2013 a cupcake you eat off a stick. Whereas we previously sold exclusively to other businesses, we are now able to sell to individual consumers \u2013 tapping into the trend of baking, with cupcake cases being hugely popular.\u201d Established in 1995, eBay is one of the largest marketplaces in the world today, with 164 million active buyers and 1bn listings worldwide. A total of 57% of eBay\u2019s sales are generated by mobile phones.",

    "webTitle": "European commission plans to overhaul how companies report profits", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The European commission will launch a further crackdown on tax avoidance by reviving a long-stalled plan to overhaul how companies report their profits, according to Europe\u2019s most senior tax policy official. Under the plans, companies would have to calculate their profits under common European rules rather than national ones, closing down options for creative cross-border accountancy. The draft law, known as the common consolidated corporate tax base, will be published in late October or early November. The idea has failed in the past, partly because of opposition from the UK and Ireland. But Pierre Moscovici, the European commissioner for economic and financial affairs, said that public outrage about companies paying very low rates of tax was helping the idea gain traction. \u201cWe have a strong asset that was not present five years ago \u2013 it is the mood in the public and the scandals, which give us some strength. Clearly today the public cannot stand that multinationals do not pay their fair share of taxes, while ordinary citizens did in order to reduce deficits.\u201d The UK Treasury, under both Gordon Brown and George Osborne, opposed previous attempts to draw up common EU tax rules because it wanted to preserve national competence in this area. Moscovici, who met the chancellor, Philip Hammond, in Bratislava earlier this month, said he did not consider \u201cthe UK as an obstacle \u2026 when we speak on the fight against tax avoidance\u201d, though he expects \u201cvery difficult debates\u201d on the plans. Speaking in a wide-ranging interview with the Guardian and other European newspapers including Le Figaro and S\u00fcddeutsche Zeiting, Moscovici also said the commission was not seeking to punish the UK over Brexit but would uphold the integrity of the single market. \u201cThis commission is not organising a dirty fight, our goal is not to punish. But the principles are there,\u201d he said. \u201cThe freedoms of the internal market cannot be seen one without the other.\u201d Moscovici, who also oversees the EU customs union, would not be drawn on whether he wanted the UK to remain in the free-trade area. Non-EU members such as Turkey have joined the EU customs union by agreeing to abide by EU trade agreements. The British government has not decided whether it wishes to remain in the customs union, but the international trade secretary, Liam Fox, is pressing for the UK to pull out. Moscovici said the question \u201cdoes not only depend on our own spirit, it also depends on the strategy of the British government. And for that we are still waiting patiently.\u201d Echoing other European leaders, he said the EU was prepared for Brexit divorce talks. \u201cWe are ready to negotiate tomorrow and that is not a joke,\u201d he said. \u201cWe understand that this government needs time to prepare its negotiations, [but if it] waits for too long then it will seem that the democratic will is not respected.\u201d The former French finance minister said British politicians had not prepared the ground for the EU referendum following decades of badmouthing Brussels. He said the remain campaign would have been on more solid foundations if successive British governments had sought to instil more pride in Europe. \u201cThat is the lesson that must be learnt in all European capitals,\u201d he said. \u201cI am not satisfied with politicians who make believe that by having less Europe or a weak Europe you can reconcile people to the European Union. My message is that if you want to fight anti-European positions you need to have a very pro-European stance.\u201d An ally of Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, who is languishing in polls ahead of France\u2019s 2017 elections, Moscovici said the EU executive was determined to push back \u201cagainst populists\u2019 destructive agenda, which can lead us to a dead end\u201d. \u201cThis commission is an anti-populist commission. We believe that fighting anti-European populism is part of our mission.\u201d He also promised not to rest on efforts to construct Europe\u2019s half-finished monetary union. Observers expect policies to develop monetary union will be in the deep freeze until new governments have been elected in France and Germany. Moscovici, a seasoned player in the Greek bailout saga, warned that no one could afford to kick the debate into the long grass. Under his proposals, companies would face a single set of rules on how to calculate profits, but national governments would remain free to set the rate of corporation tax. Moscovici has promised the Irish finance minister, Michael Noonan, that he would not attempt to create a single EU rate of corporate tax. Ireland, which is fighting the commission\u2019s ruling that it gave Apple a sweetheart tax deal, has always closely guarded its 12.5% corporate tax rate, among the lowest in the EU. Moscovici described he decision against Apple as \u201ca watershed moment\u201d, adding that it was not a decision against American companies or the Irish government. \u201cWe have sent out a signal that the era of large-scale tax avoidance by multinationals in Europe has ended.\u201d But the commission has not been immune to criticism on tax. The European commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker, was in the firing line when Luxembourg\u2019s role in allowing massive corporate tax avoidance surfaced just weeks after he took office in 2014. Juncker ran the grand duchy for almost two decades when the tax schemes were hatched. Asked last week about his role, Juncker said: \u201cVery often, bank robbers and poachers are amongst the best police forces.\u201d",

The argument, one assumes, was that an outsider would be more likely to explode a corporate structure that Woodford complains is like four FTSE 100 companies bolted together. The fund manager may therefore be miffed that Witty\u2019s successor is an insider. Indeed, Emma Walmsley is boss of the consumer healthcare division, in theory the easiest unit to detach. Is GSK giving its critics the brush-off? Is it signalling that its collection of consumer brands, which runs from Horlicks to toothpaste to headache pills, is so prized that is must always be retained? That is one possible explanation but, as ever with new chief executives, it is not wise to prejudge them. And, actually, Walmsley should take her time. There is no urgent need to reach for the corporate hacksaw \u2013 and it may never be required on her watch. The natural moment to assess the future of her consumer business is 2018, which is when joint venture partner Novartis can sell its 35% holding to GSK at \u201cfair\u201d market value. If Reckitt Benckiser, or whoever, makes a fat offer for the brands in the meantime, that would change things; but there\u2019s no sign so far. The break-it-up theory runs deeper, of course, and rests on the idea that GSK would be better managed in pieces, and be worth more. It\u2019s an idea but it doesn\u2019t feel compelling today. First, the shock of GSK\u2019s profits warning in mid-2014 has passed. Second, Brexit put a whoosh into the share prices of dollar-earners. GSK is now at \u00a316.45, not the \u00a314 of the spring; it got lucky, but they all count. Third, if the company can show it can survive the loss of Advair, its fading asthma blockbuster, without cutting its dividend, life gets easier. There are no more big patent expiries for about a decade. Walmsley, then, can afford to be patient. For a first step, she could concentrate on retaining Abbas Hussain, head of the core pharmaceutical division and her main internal rival for the job. Witty was similarly a surprise victor eight years ago and both his rivals quit within months. Surely it\u2019s third and last chance for Mike Ashley We\u2019ll judge the independence of Sports Direct\u2019s \u201cindependent\u201d review of working practices and corporate governance when it arrives. But Mike Ashley must know this is his last chance to address the complaints credibly. He conducted the first attempt himself; for the second, he appointed a tame, retained legal firm, RPC; the third version has to be the real deal. The reviewer could start by testing Ashley\u2019s claim on Tuesday that \u201cyou\u2019d be surprised at how little I knew what was going on, and that was really where the failing was\u201d. This statement is odd in several ways. The Unite union had been shouting its complaints loudly for years. A curious owner, let alone a famously hands-on operator such as Ashley, would have made it his business to investigate. Or, if chief executive Dave Forsey is to blame for failing to inform the board, which was RPC\u2019s version, why is he still in a job? Forsey was docked a \u00a33.6m bonus, but, measured against the damage to Sport Direct\u2019s standing, the forfeit seems an exercise in tokenism. The harder governance questions relate to the make-up of the board. It is impossible to believe a properly independent review could support Keith Hellawell\u2019s survival. The chairman has been rejected by outside shareholders, a public loss of authority from which there is no comeback. But the review must also explain why Sports Direct can seem at times to be run as a family firm, rather than as a public company where outsiders own 45% of the equity. Ashley\u2019s daughter\u2019s 26-year-old boyfriend, Mike Murray, is paid \u201cat the board\u2019s discretion\u201d to do property deals with an annual budget of \u00a3300m, equivalent to a year\u2019s profit. Then there is a distribution deal involving Ashley\u2019s brother\u2019s company. Are these arrangements being policed adequately on behalf of independent shareholders? Maybe the candidates for the new position of workers\u2019 representative on the board could ask the same question. It\u2019s fascinating that Ashley has created the post to try to promote healthy relations with staff. But, if it\u2019s a proper directorship, the duties and responsibilities aren\u2019t limited to speaking up for the workers. Let\u2019s hope Ashley appreciates the point.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Warm weather and Team GB\u2019s success at the Olympics and Paralympics boosted supermarket sales over the past three months, as Britons in celebratory mood splashed out on alcohol. Supermarket sales rose 0.3% over the 12 weeks to 11 September, with a particular lift from alcohol sales over the final month of the period, up 8.5% according to Kantar Worldpanel. Prosecco and Champagne were the most popular tipples, boosting sales of sparkling wine by 36% over the shorter four-week period. But Fraser McKevitt, head of retail and consumer insight at the market analysis firm, said strong drinks sales masked a weaker picture overall. \u201cWhile overall sales growth has been slow, consumers have been keen to celebrate Britain\u2019s Olympic and Paralympic golden summer ... as promotional events across a number of retailers successfully tapped into the nation\u2019s celebratory mood.\u201d A breakdown of figures for the major supermarkets showed that Aldi and Lidl continued to outperform their peers. Sales rose 11.6% and 9.5% respectively at the two discount chains over the three months, compared with the same period a year earlier. \u201cAldi and Lidl continue to grow \u2013 not only are both continuing to expand their store estates but existing customers are visiting more frequently and upping their basket size,\u201d McKevitt said. \u201cThe discounters are helping drive the industry-wide growth in premium own-label lines, with marketing campaigns moving away from showcasing only price to a focus on quality.\u201d Tesco sales fell 0.2%, but it was the retailer\u2019s best 12-week performance in two years, again boosted by alcohol sales. Its share of the market edged down 0.1 percentage points to 28.1%, but it remained considerably ahead of its next biggest rival, Sainsbury\u2019s, which had a 15.9% share. Tesco was the best performer among the \u201cbig four\u201d supermarkets, which includes Sainsburys, Asda and Morrisons. At Waitrose, a 3.4% increase in sales over the three months boosted its share of the grocery market to a record high of 5.3%, following a promotional push. McKevitt said: \u201cIt\u2019s half-price event boosted performance across much of the store \u2013 particularly in household and alcohol. However, the increase in sales has come at a cost, with Waitrose\u2019s proportion of promotional sales reaching a higher level than some of the traditionally more promotion-focused big four retailers.\u201d Weekly sales figures published separately by Waitrose\u2019s parent group, John Lewis Partnership, showed sales at the supermarket were 3.7% higher in the week ending 17 September, compared with a year earlier, hitting \u00a3125m. The increase was driven by the unusually warm September weather, which caused sales of ice-cream and barbecue food to spike. Ben Stimson, the retail director at Waitrose, said: \u201cThe weather during a week in which the UK\u2019s warmest September day since 1911 was recorded helped drive a good performance last week before the sunshine turned to downpours. \u201cIce-cream sales were up almost 43%, barbecue sales were up by 100% and service counter meat sales up by 32%.\u201d Salads and sushi were also popular last week. Sales at John Lewis over the week grew by 0.9% to \u00a379m. Sales of electricals and home technology increased by 9.9% compared with a year earlier, boosted by the release of the iPhone 7 and wireless headphones. Clothing was a weak spot for the department store chain, with fashion down 8% over the week. John Lewis blamed the fall on the September heatwave.",

Sales rose 11.6% and 9.5% respectively at the two discount chains over the three months, compared with the same period a year earlier.</p> <p>\u201cAldi and Lidl continue to grow \u2013 not only are both continuing to expand their store estates but existing customers are visiting more frequently and upping their basket size,\u201d McKevitt said.</p> <p>\u201cThe discounters are helping drive the industry-wide growth in premium own-label lines, with marketing campaigns moving away from showcasing only price to a focus on quality.\u201d </p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/tesco\">Tesco</a> sales fell 0.2%, but it was the retailer\u2019s best 12-week performance in two years, again boosted by alcohol sales. Its share of the market edged down 0.1 percentage points to 28.1%, but it remained considerably ahead of its next biggest rival, Sainsbury\u2019s, which had a 15.9% share.</p> <p>Tesco was the best performer among the \u201cbig four\u201d supermarkets, which includes Sainsburys, Asda and Morrisons.</p> <p>At Waitrose, a 3.4% increase in sales over the three months boosted its share of the grocery market to a record high of 5.3%, following a promotional push.</p> <p>McKevitt said: \u201cIt\u2019s half-price event boosted performance across much of the store \u2013 particularly in household and alcohol. However, the increase in sales has come at a cost, with Waitrose\u2019s proportion of promotional sales reaching a higher level than some of the traditionally more promotion-focused big four retailers.\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.johnlewispartnership.co.uk/financials/weekly-figures/latest.html\">Weekly sales figures published separately by Waitrose\u2019s parent group, John Lewis Partnership,</a> showed sales at the supermarket were 3.7% higher in the week ending 17 September, compared with a year earlier, hitting \u00a3125m.</p> <p>The increase was driven by the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/sep/13/uks-hottest-september-day-since-1949-32c-heathrow\">unusually warm September weather</a>, which caused sales of ice-cream and barbecue food to spike.</p> <p>Ben Stimson, the retail director at Waitrose, said: \u201cThe weather during a week in which the UK\u2019s warmest September day since 1911 was recorded helped drive a good performance last week before the sunshine turned to downpours.</p> <p>\u201cIce-cream sales were up almost 43%, barbecue sales were up by 100% and service counter meat sales up by 32%.\u201d</p> <p>Salads and sushi were also popular last week.</p> <p>Sales at John Lewis over the week grew by 0.9% to \u00a379m. Sales of electricals and home technology increased by 9.9% compared with a year earlier, boosted by the release of the iPhone 7 and wireless headphones.</p> <p>Clothing was a weak spot for the department store chain, with fashion down 8% over the week. John Lewis blamed the fall on the September heatwave.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Michael Saunders, the newest member of the Bank of England\u2019s monetary policy committee, voted to keep interest rates on hold last week. But in an interview with the Financial Times he said he was ready to call for a cut if unemployment picked up. He said: At the moment I think the economy still has some slack left in the labour market, you can see that in the subdued pace of pay growth. If the jobless rate were to rise, increasing labour market slack further, then that would be an argument in favour of lower interest rates. On the other hand he believed the UK economy was set for a less severe slowdown than most economists expect. He said: In the near term, the next year or two, I think the economy will slow, but perhaps not slow as much as the consensus has been expecting. This is partly because of the support from loose financial conditions, partly because of the underlying advantages - including supply side flexibility - of the UK economy. On that note, it\u2019s time to close for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back again tomorrow for a day of central bank rate decisions. With investors unsure what lies in store on Wednesday from the Bank of Japan and US Federal Reserve interest rate meetings, European markets have lost some of their early gains and ended in rather a mixed fashion. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished up 17.24 points or 0.25% at 6830.79 Germany\u2019s Dax edged up 0.19% to 10,393.86 France\u2019s Cac closed down 0.13% at 4388.60 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB fell 1.17% to 16,207.10 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended down 0.34% at 8686.1 In Greece, the Athens market added 0.56% to 560.59 On Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 32 points or 0.18%. Ahead of the US Federal Reserve decision comes the latest from the Bank of Japan, with the results of its comprehensive review of monetary policy expected. Analysts are uncertain what this might bring in practise, whether it be a further push into negative rate territory or further economic stimulus. But most believe there will be no change to the Bank of Japan\u2019s inflation target of 2%. James Stanley, currency analyst at DailyFX, said: The big question is whether this review will lead-in to more stimulus or an introduction of monetary prudence. Many are questioning Japan\u2019s ability to do more stimulus given the size of their programs over the past four years; although in that last Bank of Japan press conference [governor Haruhiko] Kuroda addressed this head on, sharing his view that the BoJ hasn\u2019t yet hit the limits of monetary expansion. But there are some very big peripheral questions to be answered by the BoJ in this review, as in what are they going to do about the 2% target that they announced in April 2013 that they said they expected to hit in 2 years? That was April of 2015, or approximately 17 months ago, and yet we\u2019re still very far away from that target being realistically met. Also at issue are negative rates...would they dare to do more here given that results have been non-existent? And in terms of asset purchases: The BoJ has been buying \u00a580 Trillion a year in assets for a few years now. They\u2019re already cornering their own government bond market. Does the BoJ dare do more after four years have shown little hope of actually kick-starting inflation? So, nobody really knows what the BoJ will say during this review to be released tonight. This could lead to hazardous conditions if trading around the Yen as markets are appearing to approach tonight\u2019s event rather tepidly under the same guise of uncertainty that we are. Simon MacAdam at Capital Economics said: We expect the BoJ to cut its policy rate deeper into negative territory today which, according to the Overnight Index Swap market, does not appear to be expected until early next year. Admittedly, it is more difficult to gauge where we sit relative to the market on the prospects for further unconventional policy easing in Japan. But we suspect that we are more dovish. [There has been] speculation that there will be a policy shift away from asset purchases. Indeed, the yield curve has steepened recently in anticipation of the BoJ adopting this stance: long-dated yields have hit six-month highs this month. We believe, though, that the BoJ\u2019s Comprehensive Policy Review will throw open the door to innovative policy measures. Rather than scale back its asset purchases, we think that the Bank may increase them and is more likely to find other ways to support systemically-important institutions, such as lending to commercial banks at negative interest rates. The pound has hit a five year low against the dollar, weighed down by concerns about the economic risks of Brexit. Sterling fell as low as $1.2948 and is currently down 0.55% at $1.2950 amid worries about the outcome of talks about Britain leaving the European Union, especially with some EU members promising there would be no easy ride. The strength of the dollar is also a factor, with the outside chance of a US rate rise at this week\u2019s Federal Reserve meeting. Investors are also nervous ahead of the forthcoming Bank of Japan meeting. Currency markets are also unnerved by the prospect that Donald Trump may win the forthcoming US election. Neil Wilson, markets analyst at ETX Capital, said: The pound seems to be a victim of some skittishness ahead the major central bank meetings this week in Japan and the US. Markets anticipate the Fed will keep rates on hold but a hike is not being ruled out, which may be rattling traders. Moreover, even if the US central bank holds fire, traders seem primed for a \u2018hawkish hold\u2019 where the Fed would effectively give the green light for the fed funds rate to increase later this year, probably in December. All eyes are on whether long-time dove Boston Fed president Eric Rosengren shifts his stance and votes for a hike, as some have speculated he might. Despite talk of a Brexit bounce, the pound has come under pressure of late. It\u2019s now trading close to 5 cents off its high of September 6th. The pace of the sell-off picked up markedly after the Bank of England said last week that it still expects to cut rates again this year. If UK data continues to remain solid, the Bank might have row back on that prediction, which could be positive for the pound. Here\u2019s a neat explanation of why the Federal Reserve has struggled to raise interest rates: Back in the UK, the Bank of England has bought up \u00a31.17bn of long-dated government bonds from investors. That\u2019s part of its plan to support the UK economy following the EU referendum - pushing down the interest rate on these gilts, and encouraging riskier lending. What a difference nine months, some weak economic data, and a Brexit vote makes... But not everyone on Wall Street expects the Fed to hold interest rates. BNP Paribas and Barclays are both predicting that policymakers will take the plunge, and raise borrowing costs. Laura Rosner, senior U.S. economist in New York at BNP, argues that economic conditions are good enough to justify a hike. \u201cThere is no perfect time -- there will always be some uncertainties in the data,\u201d said \u201cDespite a multitude of shocks through the last nine months, which have delayed the Fed, hiring has continued to be robust. There is a window of opportunity for the Fed to continue normalizing, and we think it\u2019ll take it.\u201d US interest rates have been on hold since last December, at just 0.25%-0.5%. The Fed initially expected to manage four rate hikes this year - now, one hike looks like their limit. So the normalisation process is taking an awfully long time, as Reuters\u2019 Jamie McGeever points out: Ding ding! The Wall Street opening bell has been rung for the last full trading session before America\u2019s central bank sets monetary policy. And shares are rallying in New York, and in Europe, as investors wager that the US Federal Reserve will decide not to raise interest rates tomorrow. The Dow Jones industrial average has gained 104 points, or 0.6%, in early trading to 18,224. Nearly every company on the index has risen. The broader S&amp;P 500 index has gained 0.5%. European markets have also had a good day (apart from Italy, where fears over its banking sector have pushed shares down). London\u2019s FTSE 100 has gained 40 points, on top of Monday\u2019s 103-point jump. Today\u2019s weak-looking US housing data has left many traders concluding that the Fed won\u2019t risk a shock hike tomorrow. Analysts at RBC Capital Markets explain why: The September FOMC meeting is finally upon us. It has been the subject of considerable speculation along the way, especially in late August when various Fed speakers were signaling a desire to raise rates. However, U.S. economic data has since cooled as twin ISM numbers printed weakly and a sprinkling of other measures also disappointed expectations. Accordingly, market expectations have drifted down to around a 20% chance of a rate increase from the current 0.375% level at this meeting. Historically, the Fed has never raised rates unless the market has assigned a likelihood of 60% or higher. As such, a rate hike is now quite unlikely for September. However... a couple of Wall Street dealers believe the Fed could defy expectations, and vote to raise interest rates..... Don\u2019t forget that the Bank of Japan also holds a crucial monetary policy meeting overnight. But investors are genuinely baffled about what the BoJ might do - and how the markets might react. Newsflash from America: The number of new house-building projects slumped by 5.8% in August. And the number of permits for new properties shrank by 0.4%, following an 0.8% decline in July. That\u2019s important, because it\u2019s another reason for the US central bank, the Fed, not to raise interest rates at its meeting on Wednesday. When Mike Ashley described himself as a PR nightmare, this may be what he had in mind: Theresa May made some bold promises about improving labour rights on her swift march to Downing Street, including putting workers on company boards [which Sports Direct will now do]. So it\u2019s not too surprising that that Department of Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy has welcomed the firm\u2019s pledge to change. A spokeswoman says: \u201cThe Government is clear that everybody deserves to be treated with respect and employers have a responsibility to ensure that pay is fair no matter who you are or what you do. Both the Business Select Committee report and Sports Direct\u2019s review into their own working practices detailed some concerning findings, so it is right that they take decisive action to resolve these internal issues as quickly as possible.\u201d Breaking away from Sports Direct.... there\u2019s a lot of chat about the impact of the Brexit vote on Ireland today. Our correspondent Henry McDonald reports: Ireland should woo UK firms who want to remain trading in the EU to relocate to cities like Dublin, Cork and Limerick, the British-Irish Chamber of Commerce said today. The Anglo-Irish trade body\u2019s Director General John McGrane said the Republic should follow the lead of other EU states and cities that were seeking to persuade UK firms to set up bases within the Eurozone post-Brexit. McGrane also warned that Ireland \u2013 with its land border with Northern Ireland and the fact that its single biggest trading partner is the UK \u2013 is the most exposed EU country to Brexit. He was speaking a seminar on Brexit and Ireland organised by the main opposition party in the Dail, Fianna Fail, in Carlow today. Accepting and respecting the UK vote on Brexit, McGrade told the think-in: \u201cEnterprises think about multi-location and so Ireland should rightly be the natural first choice for UK employers looking for a guaranteed EU base and equally Irish firms looking to secure trade with the UK should consider a UK base. With other EU cities encouraging migration of UK firms, we shouldn\u2019t be shy to lay out our own advantages and to encourage investment in Ireland from anyone looking to trade inside the EU.\u201d He also called on the Irish government to implement a \u201cNational Brexit Strategy Plan\u201d to cope with the shocks of the UK outside the EU. Meanwhile in Belfast, Ryanair boss Michael O\u2019Leary has warned that investment will suffer while the Brexit drama plays out. Relations between Sports Direct and the unions have long been fraught. But Janet Williamson, chair of the Trade Union Share Owners, suggests that the new independent review is a good opportunity for a fresh start. \u201cThis is good news for Sports Direct workers, especially young workers who make up a large part of their staff but too often get a poor deal at work. \u201cThe board should now consult both shareholders and trade unions in finalising the plans for the independent review. Trade unions representing workers at Sports Direct stand ready to work with the company to ensure a successful future that is fair for its staff.\u201d Unions will presumably be pushing Ashley to offer permanent contracts to the 4,000-ish agency workers, who are employed at Shirebrook on effectively zero-hours contracts. We don\u2019t often find the City singing from the same hymn sheet as Britain\u2019s unions. But the two sides are united today. After putting pressure on Ashley for months, investors are generally welcoming the decision to hold a properly independent review of Sports Direct\u2019s operations. Paul Lee, head of corporate governance at Aberdeen Asset Management, called it a \u201cgood start\u201d: The fact that the review will now be undertaken by an independent party provides comfort and I am sure all shareholders will welcome the opportunity to offer constructive thoughts on the remit of the review. There is much more work to be done but hopefully today is the first step on the long journey to rebuild investor trust and to rectify the problems at SportsDirect. All shareholders want a well governed, sustainable business.\u201d Andy Griffiths, executive director of the Investor Forum, is also pleased: Our Members believe this is an opportunity to bring about meaningful and lasting change, and are committed to working constructively with the Board and the independent reviewer to ensure it can be a turning point in rebuilding trust.\u201d Relations between Mike Ashley and the City hit a nadir this month when investors voted against chairman Keith Hellawell\u2019s reappointment. They are also unhappy that Mike Ashley\u2019s brother has a deal to deliver Sports Direct products abroad. Eyebrows have also been raised over the appointment of Michael Murray, boyfriend of Ashley\u2019s elder daughter Anna, as a property consultant. The Unite union reckon Mike Ashley has now \u201cgrasped\u201d the need to tackle the employment problems at Sports Direct. They are also pushing the government to outlaw zero-hours contracts (reminder: Ashley is offering permanent contracts to all workers at his retail shops, but not to agency staff at the retailer\u2019s Derbyshire warehouse). Unite assistant general secretary Steve Turner says: \u201cIncreasingly businesses are recognising that they have no place in the modern workplace and are bad for workers, bad for business and bad for the economy. The government should now show leadership and follow the lead of government\u2019s like New Zealand and ban zero-hours contracts.\u201d Jon Tricket, Labour\u2019s shadow business secretary, has criticised Mike Ashley for dragging his feet over allowing an independent review of Sports Direct. He says: \u201cNews that Sports Direct is finally responding to its shareholder wishes and agreeing to an independent review of its working practices and corporate governance is a step in the right direction towards ridding the company of its exploitative practices once and for all. \u201cApparent resistance by Mr Ashley has made this process harder than it needed to be. Labour are looking at ways to improve corporate governance to avoid such scandals in the future, and to ensure that the highest standards apply in British industry.\u201d The Press Association has a good write-up of Mike Ashley\u2019s TV performance, by Aine Fox. \u2018PR NIGHTMARE\u2019 MIKE ASHLEY DEFENDS FLYING TO WORK BY HELICOPTER Sports Direct boss Mike Ashley said he is being \u201creal\u201d when he chooses to travel by helicopter, and disclosed that a cleaning lady at the company was paid an \u00a380,000 bonus. Speaking after the firm announced it would have an independent review of its working practices and corporate governance, he reiterated his apology for things that had gone wrong but insisted there have also been positives at the retailer. He defended his expensive method of travel, and said the government is responsible for workers being paid the minimum wage, not him. He told BBC Breakfast: \u201cI do fly to work by helicopter, it\u2019s a reality. So when people say, \u2018Oh be real\u2019, that\u2019s how I travel.\u201d He added: \u201cPeople will say, \u2018How can you have a plane when your workers are on minimum wage?\u2019 \u201cI said, \u2018But I don\u2019t set the minimum wage.\u2019 If the minimum wage would be the living wage, then the government who set the rules should set it at the living wage. That\u2019s as I look at it.\u201d Mr Ashley put the poor practices discovered at the business down to a \u201crotten apple in the barrel\u201d and said there are a lot of good things about the firm. He said: \u201cI can tell you in the last five years Sports Direct will have paid out over 200 million in bonuses. So I can tell you the cleaning lady got an \u00a380,000 bonus on top of her normal pay. Nobody in the UK has done that. \u201cWhat we\u2019ve got to do is focus on getting the bits we\u2019ve got wrong, to the extreme highs of the bits we\u2019ve got right. \u201cAnd paying out that kind of money doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re allowed to get these bits wrong, where clearly I\u2019ve taken my eye off the ball. \u201cI\u2019ve said sorry, I\u2019ve said I\u2019m going to fix it, and I will.\u201d Describing himself as a bit of a \u201cPR nightmare\u201d, he referred to the moment he joked that he had been to the casino after he pulled a wad of cash from his pocket when he was showing investors and journalists around the Shirebrook warehouse earlier this month. He said: \u201cThe one thing people didn\u2019t say to me was, \u2018Mike, have you checked how much money you\u2019ve got in your pocket?\u2019 And of course nobody thought to ask me whether or not I had genuinely been to the casino a few days earlier.\u201d Joey Barton, the oft-banned footballer, has given us an insight into Ashley\u2019s treatment of his workers (and that helicopter). Our sports writer Donald McRae explains: Barton skewers Mike Ashley, Newcastle United\u2019s owner, with a simple story. When Barton was released from prison on bail he was placed in the care of Peter Kay in Southampton \u2013 and only allowed out between 7am and 7pm. Kay had convinced the judge that, while he would counsel Barton, the footballer would be more balanced if he played the game he loved. \u201cAshley offered me his helicopter,\u201d Barton remembers, \u201cas my curfew meant Pete and I needed to fly to and from training in Newcastle. It seemed really generous until I got an eye\u2011boggling invoice. It was business after all.\u201d The Green party hopes Sports Direct\u2019s U-turn signals a fundamental shift towards workers\u2019 rights. They are pushing the government to breathe new life into a review of working conditions, which stalled two years ago. Recent problems at Deliveroo and Uber show that workers are still being exploited, the party argues. Here\u2019s Jonathan Bartley, the co-leader: \u201cSports Direct has continually dragged its feet and tried to avoid the fully independent review into working practices that\u2019s so desperately needed, so this announcement is as welcome as it is overdue. This is only the beginning of a process which must see the end of exploitation at Britain\u2019s biggest sports firm. \u201cSlowly but surely we\u2019re seeing trade unions, shareholders and campaigners force big firms to address the profound injustice being faced by so many workers in Britain. Only time will tell whether working conditions in Sports Direct\u2019s Shirebrook warehouse \u2013 which has been compared to a Victorian workhouse \u2013 will really improve in practice. Our focus must then broaden to root out the many other firms who are reaping the benefits from the so-called \u2018gig economy\u2019 at the expense of workers.\u201d \u201cThe government must now reopen the Employment Review launched in 2014 [1], which could clarify and strengthen the employment status of up to a million British workers. It should also act quickly to crack down on employers like Sports Direct. Ending zero-hour contracts, guaranteeing trade union access to all workplaces and introducing a genuine living wage are just a few steps which would make a huge difference to millions of working people\u2019s lives.\u201d Reaction to Mike Ashley\u2019s interview, and the new independent inquiry into his company, is still coming in. Lecturer and consultant Hayley Lewis says the \u201cI didn\u2019t know\u201d defence simply isn\u2019t acceptable. (Although Ashley isn\u2019t actually the chief executive, he does in effect run the company and owns a majority stake). Retail analyst Paul Mitchell is more positive: And the Daily Mail\u2019s Henry Deedes provides the fashion angle \u2013 Ashley has produced a new tie for his big day: The City has welcomed Sports Direct\u2019s decision to get an independent review of its working practices. Shares in the company have risen by 2% this morning, making it one of the best-performing companies on the London stock market. Labour MP Angela Rayner isn\u2019t impressed by Mike Ashley\u2019s defence for only paying the bare minimum to his workers: James Wilmore of Retail Week thinks Ashley\u2019s rotten apple defence smells fishy. PR consultant Julie Fuge reckons Ashley had been coached before his ordeal on the red sofa, but he couldn\u2019t stick to the script: And here\u2019s Helen Cahill of City AM\u2019s verdict: Mike Ashley\u2019s claim that a few \u201cbad apples\u201d caused the problems at Sports Direct doesn\u2019t really add up. Two weeks ago, his own lawyers concluded that there had been \u201cserious shortcomings\u201d in working practices at its warehouse, for which the company apologised. That included the notorious \u201csix strikes\u201d which its agencies operated \u2013 meaning the army of casual staff at Shirebrook risked being sanctioned if they chatted too much, wore the \u201cwrong\u201d branded clothes, or were simply off ill. And a \u201cbad apple\u201d can hardly be blamed for the laborious search operations that meant staff in effect received less than the minimum wage. Ashley admitted this morning that he didn\u2019t have a firm grip on HR issues \u2013 that\u2019s a structural failing, not a few rogue employees. Mike Ashley used to have a reputation as a particularly secretive business chief (before surprisingly buying Newcastle United in 2007). So today\u2019s outing on the BBC Breakfast sofas was a rare experience. But what did we actually learn? Ashley is sticking to his position that he didn\u2019t know how workers were being mistreated across his empire. Clearly, any competent boss should have known, or at least cared, about how their main warehouse operated. But Ashley can\u2019t be fired, as he owns more than half of Sports Direct; he can just promise to do better. He\u2019s trying to buy himself a lot of time. Phrases like: \u201cIt\u2019ll still need fixing when I\u2019m dead,\u201d suggest that Sports Direct is a kind of retailing Forth Bridge, forever dogged by peeling paint and a neverending fight against decay. He\u2019s playing for public support. Ashley claims to be a PR nightmare \u2013 then tantalises the audience by revealing that he paid a cleaning lady an \u00a380k bonus. What a decent chap, eh? But the mask did slip\u2026 Ashley was on his very best behaviour (unlike at this month\u2019s AGM when he lashed out at the unions). But towards the end of the interview, he basically claimed it was the government\u2019s fault that Sports Direct paid its workers so little, as they set the minimum wage. Someone should probably remind Mike that he\u2019s allowed to pay more than the legal minimum \u2026 Q: Are you confident that, five years down the line, Sports Direct will be a very different place to the \u201cVictorian workhouse\u201d conditions workers have suffered? Ashley: In the last five years, Sports Direct have paid out more than \u00a3200m in bonuses. The cleaning lady got an \u00a380,000 bonus on top of her normal pay. No ne in the UK has done that. We need to get the bits we\u2019ve got wrong up to the level of the extreme bits we\u2019ve got right, Ashley adds. And he concludes with a pledge to get the job done: Clearly I\u2019ve taken my eye off the ball. I\u2019ve said sorry, I\u2019ve said I\u2019m going to fix it and I will. And that\u2019s the end of the BBC interview. Ashley then defends his use of private planes and helicopters to do business, saying it\u2019s wrong to compare his lifestyle to an ordinary worker\u2019s. I don\u2019t get paid a salary, but I do like to go by private plane \u2013 it saves a lot of time and is very efficient. Then people say: \u2018How can you have a plane when your workers are on minimum wage?\u2019. I don\u2019t set the minimum wage, Ashley adds, arguing that if the minimum wage should be the living wage, then the government should set it at that level. Now on to Ashley\u2019s public relations gaffe last week, when he produced a massive wad of \u00a350 notes during a security search at his factory. Q: Wasn\u2019t that a massive PR disaster? That\u2019s why I\u2019ve never tried to do PR, Ashley grins. I\u2019m a nightmare for PR. He explains that no one asked me to check his pockets \u201cin case I\u2019d just been to the casino\u201d, before he had to empty his pockets in front of a crowd of journalists. Now we move on to Mike Ashley\u2019s future at the company he founded. Q: Your reputation is on the line here \u2013 so how long are you giving yourself to turn Sports Direct around? Ashley says that he\u2019s trying to improve Sports Direct\u2019s stores, and also fix the problems on the personnel side. We want a culture of being One Sports Direct family. Q: So if you haven\u2019t done that in a year, you\u2019ll go? Ashley rebuffs this timescale, insisting that \u201ca year is too soon\u201d to fix everything that\u2019s wrong. Instead, it sounds like a neverending task. Ashley says: You get to the top of a mountain and then you see there\u2019s another mountain. It will never stop. Even when I\u2019m dead it will never stop. With hindsight, I should have done a better job overseeing corporate governance and HR issues, Mike Ashley admits. Q: How can you make serious changes, though, when you have exactly the same board in place? Ashley says that he\u2019s now taking a more hands-on role. He insists the board is absolutely serious about turning the company around, pointing out that CEO Dave Forsey lost a bonus worth almost \u00a34m last year. Q: Why are you only offering workers just 12 hours\u2019 work a week (rather than a zero-hours contract)? People who already work a full working week will continue to do so if they take a new contract, Ashley promises. We\u2019re trying to get people into two categories \u2013 those who want a minimum guarantee each week and those who don\u2019t, he adds. Q: So were you appalled when you heard what was happening? My initial reaction was that these things couldn\u2019t be happening at Sports Direct, Mike Ashley says. He argues that Sports Direct has suffered from \u201codd isolated instances\u201d, the \u201crotten apple in the barrel\u201d which needs to be dug out. Q: Isn\u2019t your reputation in tatters? Askley repeats his line that a few \u201crotten apples\u201d are to blame Mike Ashley is speaking on BBC One now, being interviewed by Dan Walker. Q: Isn\u2019t it incredibly damaging that MPs have decribed your warehouse conditions as \u201cVictorian\u201d? Undoubtedly yes, says Mike Ashley. There were definitely some things we had to fix \u2013 we\u2019ve fixed some over the first 90 days, but there\u2019s more to fix, and some things that will always need fixing. Q: You\u2019re the founder of this company \u2013 didn\u2019t you know what was going on? You\u2019d be surprised how little I knew \u2013 and that\u2019s where the failing was, says Ashley. He explains that he can\u2019t watch every night shift, or see what\u2019s happening at his company during the weekend. There\u2019s lots of hours in the week when I\u2019m not there, he adds. Should I known more, yes? Did I know what was happening? Absolutely not. Sports Direct says it has already fixed some of the serious problems at Shirebrook, such as the security searches conducted after workers\u2019 paid shifts have ended. But the independent team will want to check whether the other problems, which led to Shirebook being labelled \u201cthe gulag\u201d are being addressed: Sports Direct\u2019s decision is being welcomed as a major win for shareholders and campaigners. Here\u2019s Ian Smith of Investors Chronicle: Deirdre Hipwell of the Times says it\u2019s a major climbdown by Mike Ashley: Antonia Bance, head of campaigns at the TUC union, is also pleased: Big news from Sports Direct this morning \u2013 the retailer has agreed to hold an independent review of its working practices and corporate governance. This looks like a U-turn from founder Mike Ashley. He had originally planned to use his own lawyers, RPC, to conduct the inquiry, but has been pressured by large shareholders to get a fully independent team involved instead. Today the company bowed to that pressure, telling shareholders that: Sports Direct today announces that the forthcoming \u2018360-degree\u2019 review of working practices and corporate governance which was announced on 6 September 2016 and which was to be led by RPC will now be led by an independent party other than RPC. RPC has already conducted one review of Sports Direct, which concluded there were serious deficiencies in the way its workers were treated. Ashley has promised to put things right, after seeing a major City backlash against his chairman following the revelations. Here\u2019s our news story on today\u2019s announcement: We\u2019re expecting to hear from Mike Ashley shortly, on the BBC 1 Breakfast show\u2026 Newsflash: the City is getting another female chief executive. Pharmaceuticals giant GlaxoSmithKline has promoted Emma Walmsley, currently the head of its Consumer Healthcare division, to replace Andrew Witty as CEO. It makes her the most powerful woman in the City, I reckon \u2013 at \u00a380bn, GSK is the sixth-largest company on the FTSE 100. Walmsley says: I am delighted and honoured to be appointed GSK\u2019s next CEO. GSK is a company that leads both in science and in the way it does business. We have momentum in the group and as the demand for medical innovation and trusted healthcare products continues to rise, we have the opportunity and the potential to create meaningful benefits for patients, consumers and our shareholders. I\u2019m looking forward to working with Andrew and other leaders over the next few months to ensure a smooth handover and to develop plans for 2017 and beyond. There are currently just five women running FTSE 100 companies, I reckon. Here\u2019s some reaction from the GSK workforce: Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. After yesterday\u2019s rally, Europe\u2019s stock markets look remarkably subdued this morning. Investors are waiting nervously for tomorrow\u2019s splurge of central bank news, with the Bank of Japan and the US Federal Reserve setting monetary policy. The markets reckon there\u2019s only a 20% chance that the Fed will hike interest rates, but a shock can\u2019t be ruled out. And no one\u2019s really confident about which way the Bank of Japan might jump. Analysts at Danske Bank predict that Japan will shake up its stimulus programme a little: We do not expect the BoJ to ease monetary policy as such but expect it to adjust its policy framework by (1) changing its wording on when it expects to achieve its 2% inflation target and (2) adding some flexibility to its government bond purchase programme while maintaining its negative interest rate policy. Due to those pesky timezones, most of Europe will be tucked up in bed when the BoJ does its thing. So trades have an edgy day ahead\u2026 Also coming up today.... UK companies Kingfisher (which runs that B&amp;Q DIY chain) and French Connection are reporting to the City. On the economic front, the latest German producer prices figures are out \u2013 showing that factories charged less for their goods last month. That suggests eurozone inflation remains subdued. And at 1.30pm BST, we get the latest US housing starts data, showing the health of the American building sector.",

That was April of 2015, or approximately 17 months ago, and yet we\u2019re still very far away from that target being realistically met. Also at issue are negative rates...would they dare to do more here given that results have been non-existent? And in terms of asset purchases: The BoJ has been buying \u00a580 Trillion a year in assets for a few years now. They\u2019re already cornering their own government bond market. Does the BoJ dare do more after four years have shown little hope of actually kick-starting inflation?</p> <p>So, nobody really knows what the BoJ will say during this review to be released tonight. This could lead to hazardous conditions if trading around the Yen as markets are appearing to approach tonight\u2019s event rather tepidly under the same guise of uncertainty that we are.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"441ab4dd8034baa79a7e513e2158ba34ecb2499a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/441ab4dd8034baa79a7e513e2158ba34ecb2499a/0_0_3000_1801/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Bank of Japan governor Haruhiko Kuroda.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bank of Japan governor Haruhiko Kuroda.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kazuhiro Nogi/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Simon MacAdam at Capital Economics said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We expect the BoJ to cut its policy rate deeper into negative territory today which, according to the Overnight Index Swap market, does not appear to be expected until early next year.</p> <p>Admittedly, it is more difficult to gauge where we sit relative to the market on the prospects for further unconventional policy easing in Japan. But we suspect that we are more dovish.</p> <p>[There has been] speculation that there will be a policy shift away from asset purchases. Indeed, the yield curve has steepened recently in anticipation of the BoJ adopting this stance: long-dated yields have hit six-month highs this month.</p> <p>We believe, though, that the BoJ\u2019s Comprehensive Policy Review will throw open the door to innovative policy measures. Rather than scale back its asset purchases, we think that the Bank may increase them and is more likely to find other ways to support systemically-important institutions, such as lending to commercial banks at negative interest rates.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"66da18b63c0c9f526f652fcf3ac3f836ed5dfa53\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/66da18b63c0c9f526f652fcf3ac3f836ed5dfa53/0_39_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Bank of Japan building in Tokyo.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Bank of Japan building in Tokyo.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Toru Hanai / Reuters/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57e14e39e4b0603ea33c4492\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-20T15:10:51.172Z\">4.10pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Pound hits five year low against the dollar</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The pound has hit a five year low against the dollar, weighed down by concerns about the economic risks of Brexit.</p> <p>Sterling fell as low as $1.2948 and is currently down 0.55% at $1.2950 amid worries about the outcome of talks about Britain leaving the European Union, especially with some EU members promising there would be no easy ride.</p> <p>The strength of the dollar is also a factor, with the outside chance of a US rate rise at this week\u2019s Federal Reserve meeting. Investors are also nervous ahead of the forthcoming Bank of Japan meeting.</p> <p>Currency markets are also unnerved by the prospect that Donald Trump may win the forthcoming US election. Neil Wilson, markets analyst at ETX Capital, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The pound seems to be a victim of some skittishness ahead the major central bank meetings this week in Japan and the US. Markets anticipate the Fed will keep rates on hold but a hike is not being ruled out, which may be rattling traders.</p> <p>Moreover, even if the US central bank holds fire, traders seem primed for a \u2018hawkish hold\u2019 where the Fed would effectively give the green light for the fed funds rate to increase later this year, probably in December. All eyes are on whether long-time dove Boston Fed president Eric Rosengren shifts his stance and votes for a hike, as some have speculated he might.</p> <p>Despite talk of a Brexit bounce, the pound has come under pressure of late. It\u2019s now trading close to 5 cents off its high of September 6<sup>th</sup>. The pace of the sell-off picked up markedly after the Bank of England said last week that it still expects to cut rates again this year. If UK data continues to remain solid, the Bank might have row back on that prediction, which could be positive for the pound.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-09-20T15:11:46.765Z\">at 4.11pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-57e1474fe4b02abd56c3f627\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-20T14:27:59.392Z\">3.27pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Here\u2019s a neat explanation of why the Federal Reserve has struggled to raise interest rates:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/KeithAkre/status/778237604160385025\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">New <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/WordOfTheDay?src=hash\">#WordOfTheDay</a> courtesy of <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BenEisen\">@BenEisen</a> of <a href=\"https://twitter.com/WSJ\">@wsj</a>.

Only time will tell whether working conditions in Sports Direct\u2019s Shirebrook warehouse \u2013 which has been compared to a Victorian workhouse \u2013 will really improve in practice. Our focus must then broaden to root out the many other firms who are reaping the benefits from the so-called \u2018gig economy\u2019 at the expense of workers.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe government must now reopen the Employment Review launched in 2014 [1], which could clarify and strengthen the employment status of up to a million British workers. It should also act quickly to crack down on employers like Sports Direct.

      "bodyText": "Wells Fargo chief executive John Stumpf should resign, return his pay and be criminally investigated over the bank\u2019s illegal sales practices, Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Tuesday. The Massachusetts senator\u2019s comments came moments after Stumpf said he was \u201cdeeply sorry\u201d for the more than 2m unauthorized accounts his staff opened for the bank\u2019s customers. The accounts, ranging from credit cards to checking accounts, were opened by thousands of the bank\u2019s employees in an effort to meet Wells Fargo\u2019s sales quotas and have already led to a record $185m fine. While testifying in front of the Senate banking committee, Stumpf said he was \u201cdeeply sorry\u201d that the bank let down its customers and apologized for violating their trust. \u201cI accept full responsibility for all unethical sales practices in our retail banking business, and I am fully committed to doing everything possible to fix this issue, strengthen our culture, and take the necessary actions to restore our customers\u2019 trust,\u201d Stumpf said in his prepared remarks. Warren accused Stumpf of \u201cgutless leadership\u201d, telling him that his definition of being accountable is to push the blame on lower-level employees who do not have a PR firm to defend them. Warren questioned Stumpf\u2019s compensation, asking him: \u201cHave you returned one nickel of the millions of dollars that you were paid while this scam was going on?\u201d \u201cThe board will take care of that,\u201d Stumpf said after attempting to duck the question. He also told Warren that this \u201cwas not a scam\u201d. Warren pointed out that during the time that the unauthorized accounts were being opened, the share price of Wells Fargo went up by about $30. Stumpf personally owns about 6.75m shares of Wells Fargo stock and made more than $200m just off his stock during that time, Warren said. Last spring, Wells Fargo employees staged a protest in front of the corporate office in Minneapolis to draw attention to its sales quotas. One of the employees joining the protest was Khalid Taha, who at that time worked as a personal banker in San Diego, California. At the time, Taha told the Guardian that in 2013 bankers like him had to sell about 20 products a day. In 2014, he said, the quota was lowered to 15 a day. Wells Fargo products include checking accounts, credit cards, overdraft insurance or travel insurance. Taha, who no longer works at Wells Fargo, said employees had to make their quotas in order to make ends meet. At the hearing Stumpf pointed out that the lowest paid employees at Wells Fargo earn $12 an hour and that the employees let go for opening unauthorized accounts were making \u201cgood money\u201d, earning $30,000 to $60,000 a year. \u201cHow much money did you make last year?\u201d New Jersey senator Robert Menendez asked Stumpf. \u201c$19.3m,\u201d said Stumpf. \u201cNow that\u2019s good money,\u201d said Menendez. Stumpf was also grilled over the compensation package awarded to the company\u2019s former consumer banking chief Carrie Tolstedt. According to Fortune, when Tolstedt retired earlier this summer she was slated to receive as much as $124.6m. Tolstedt oversaw retail banking at Wells Fargo while about 1.5m deposit accounts and 565,000 credit cards were opened without customers\u2019 permission. Stumpf said that Tolstedt is leaving the company with no retirement or severance benefits. When pushed on whether he believes her pay should be clawed back, he repeatedly said that he does not sit on the human resources and compensation part of the board. He said that he will \u201crespect and accept whatever decision they make\u201d. The bank had already agreed to refund customers for fees that were accrued on the unauthorized accounts. Additionally, the bank announced last week that it was ending the sales quotas that are at the core of this scandal. About 5,300 employees were fired for opening unauthorized accounts in order to meet their sales quotas. Yet even as he accepted responsibility and apologized, Stumpf insisted on Tuesday that the employees acted on their own. \u201cI do want to make very clear that there was no orchestrated effort, or scheme as some have called it, by the company. We never directed nor wanted our employees to provide products and services to customers they did not want or need,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is important to understand that when an employee provides a customer with a product or service that she did not request or authorize, that employee has done something flat wrong.\u201d Stumpf told the lawmakers that he has made it clear at multiple town halls with the bank\u2019s employees that he did not want unauthorized accounts to be opened. Some find it difficult to believe that the bank and its management were not involved in the scheme or at least aware of the unauthorized accounts being opened. \u201cWells Fargo is trying to blame the 5,000 workers that they have fired as a responsible party here. That\u2019s simply not true. There is no way that 5,000 workers acted individually on more than 2m transactions,\u201d said Shane Larson, the legislative director at Communications Workers of America, a labor union worker with US bank workers. \u201cThis behavior comes from the top at Wells Fargo.\u201d",

Taha, who no longer works at Wells Fargo, said employees had to make their quotas in order to make ends meet.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/sep/13/wells-fargo-eliminates-sales-quotas-unauthorized-accounts\">Wells Fargo eliminates sales quotas after unauthorized accounts scandal</a> </p> </aside>  <p>At the hearing Stumpf pointed out that the lowest paid employees at Wells Fargo earn $12 an hour and that the employees let go for opening unauthorized accounts were making \u201cgood money\u201d, earning $30,000 to $60,000 a year.</p> <p>\u201cHow much money did you make last year?\u201d New Jersey senator Robert Menendez asked Stumpf.</p> <p>\u201c$19.3m,\u201d said Stumpf.</p> <p>\u201cNow that\u2019s good money,\u201d said Menendez.</p> <p>Stumpf was also grilled over the compensation package awarded to the company\u2019s former consumer banking chief Carrie Tolstedt. <a href=\"http://fortune.com/2016/09/12/wells-fargo-cfpb-carrie-tolstedt/\">According to Fortune</a>, when Tolstedt retired earlier this summer she was slated to receive as much as $124.6m.</p> <p>Tolstedt oversaw retail banking at Wells Fargo while about 1.5m deposit accounts and 565,000 credit cards were opened <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/sep/08/wells-fargo-settlement-illegal-sales-accounts\">without customers\u2019 permission</a>.</p> <p>Stumpf said that Tolstedt is leaving the company with no retirement or severance benefits.

He said that he will \u201crespect and accept whatever decision they make\u201d.</p> <p>The bank had already agreed to refund customers for fees that were accrued on the unauthorized accounts. Additionally, the bank announced last week that it was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/sep/13/wells-fargo-eliminates-sales-quotas-unauthorized-accounts\">ending the sales quotas</a> that are at the core of this scandal. About 5,300 employees were fired for opening unauthorized accounts in order to meet their sales quotas. Yet even as he accepted responsibility and apologized, Stumpf insisted on Tuesday that the employees acted on their own.</p> <p>\u201cI do want to make very clear that there was no orchestrated effort, or scheme as some have called it, by the company. We never directed nor wanted our employees to provide products and services to customers they did not want or need,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is important to understand that when an employee provides a customer with a product or service that she did not request or authorize, that employee has done something flat wrong.\u201d </p> <p>Stumpf told the lawmakers that he has made it clear at multiple town halls with the bank\u2019s employees that he did not want unauthorized accounts to be opened. </p> <p>Some find it difficult to believe that the bank and its management were not involved in the scheme or at least aware of the unauthorized accounts being opened. </p> <p>\u201cWells Fargo is trying to blame the 5,000 workers that they have fired as a responsible party here. That\u2019s simply not true. There is no way that 5,000 workers acted individually on more than 2m transactions,\u201d said Shane Larson, the legislative director at Communications Workers of America, a labor union worker with US bank workers. \u201cThis behavior comes from the top at Wells Fargo.\u201d </p> <p><br></p>",

Motorists appear to be paying the price for advances in technology, as repairs to cameras, sensors and other hi-tech features can run into thousands of pounds. The bad news for drivers is that an imminent hike in the tax on insurance is likely to add a few more pounds to the cost of a policy. Consumer Intelligence, a market research agency specialising in insurance and banking, said the average UK motor premium stood at \u00a3788, which represented a price rise of 13.5% in the year to August. However, drivers in north-west England and London are paying up to 50% more than the national average. The average bill for a motorist in north-west England is \u00a31,177 following a 17.3% leap over 12 months, while in London it has risen 16.7% to \u00a31,068. One of the biggest UK insurers LV= suggested prices were set to rise further this year. Consumer Intelligence \u2013 whose figures are used by the government\u2019s Office for National Statistics to calculate official inflation statistics \u2013 said there were \u201chuge differences\u201d across the country and between age groups. It compared the prices offered to 3,600 people by all the major price comparison sites and leading direct insurers. Younger drivers are paying the highest bills: the average premium for an under-25 is \u00a31,831, although prices for this age group are rising at a slightly slower rate. Older drivers are experiencing higher rises \u2013 typically up 15.3% over the year \u2013 but their average annual bill, as calculated by averaging out the five cheapest premiums, is much lower at \u00a3348. Consumer Intelligence\u2019s data shows that the cheapest place to insure a car is Scotland, where the average premium is \u00a3562. On 1 October, the standard rate of insurance premium tax will rise from 9.5% to 10% \u2013 a change announced in the March 2016 budget to boost flood defences and inject cash into the most hard-hit regions. The government said that if insurers passed the cost of this increase on to their customers, the average motor insurance premium would rise by \u00a32 per year. Ian Hughes, chief executive of Consumer Intelligence, said: \u201cThe latest increase in insurance premium tax which takes effect next month, as well as rising claims, are driving the rise in premiums.\u201d LV= said on Monday that it was seeing motor claims inflation \u201cat the top end of our expectations\u201d, and that this was driven by increases in automotive technology making repairs more expensive. LV= warned: \u201cAs a consequence of the combination of reduced investment income and higher claims inflation, we expect to see the strengthening of motor rates continue in the second half of the year.\u201d",

Andrew Tyrie, chairman of the Treasury select committee, said the business put at risk if the UK lost its access to the single market \u2013 and associated passporting rights for individual companies \u2013 was significant. The Conservative MP published data provided by the Financial Conduct Authority showing 5,476 UK-registered firms hold at least one passport to do business in another EU or European Economic Area member state. Just over 8,000 companies authorised in other EU states use these rules to do business in the UK \u2013 which could be seen as a sign that the passporting rules are also important to non-UK firms. \u201cThese figures give us an initial idea of the effects of losing full access to the single market in financial services. The business put at risk could be significant. Almost 5,500 UK firms are using passports to do business in Europe, and over 8,000 European firms are using passports to provide services in the UK,\u201d said Tyrie. The issue of passporting \u2013 which allows UK authorised firms banks and fund managers to conduct business in the other 27 states \u2013 has also been highlighted by the Bundesbank president, Jens Weidmann, who told the Guardian that UK companies would lose these rights if it did not remain part of at least the EEA (EU countries and Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway). This \u201chard Brexit\u201d is favoured by some Conservatives although on Monday ratings agency Moody\u2019s downplayed the impact, saying that while there would be a loss of business the impact would be manageable. Weidmann said \u201cpassporting rights are tied to the single market and would automatically cease to apply if Great Britain is no longer at least part of the European Economic Area\u201d. Tyrie has published a pamphlet for Open Europe which argues the government must now set out what it hopes to achieve from Brexit talks and explain much of what was promised will come at considerable economic and fiscal cost. Tyrie said: \u201cNone of the current off-the-shelf arrangements can preserve existing passporting arrangements, while giving the UK the influence and control it needs over financial services regulation as it develops. Efforts to secure an appropriate arrangement for UK-based firms will be one of the most challenging aspects of the negotiations about the UK\u2019s future relationship with the EU.\u201d He urged the Bank of England governor, Mark Carney, and the chancellor, Philip Hammond, to put the issue at the top of their in-trays. \u201cNo doubt the hard grind of establishing what best protects UK interests is already under way,\u201d said Tyrie. The Treasury select committee comprises both pro-Brexit and anti-Brexit MPs. In a letter to Tyrie, Andrew Bailey, chief executive of the FCA said: \u201cA passport is a mechanism through which firms may exercise their right to provide services and their right to establishment ... As such, a passport obviates the need to obtain separate authorisations from other member states.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Emma Walmsley is in line to become one of just seven female CEOs in the FTSE 100, having been named as chief executive designate of Britain\u2019s biggest drugs company. When she takes over GlaxoSmithKline from Sir Andrew Witty on 1 April 2017, Walmsley will be running the biggest of those seven companies, with GSK ranking fourth in FTSE 100 with a market value of \u00a380bn. Investors gave a lukewarm response to the appointment of the 47-year-old, thought to be one of four internal candidates for the top job and someone with a marketing and consumer products \u2013 rather than scientific \u2013 background. Shares dropped 0.4% after the announcement. Walmsley joined GSK in 2010 after 17 years at L\u2019Or\u00e9al. She leads GSK\u2019s consumer healthcare business, which was established in 2015 after a deal with Novartis, in which Walmsley was instrumental. The married mother of four was born in Barrow-in-Furness, Cumbria, and grew up in Kent. She studied classics and modern languages at the University of Oxford. Walmsley brings considerable international experience to a business that generates most revenue outside Europe. At L\u2019Or\u00e9al, she held a variety of marketing and general management roles in the UK, Europe, the US, and China. In her last job at the French cosmetics company, Walmsley ran the company\u2019s Chinese consumer products business out of Shanghai for three years, overseeing global brands including L\u2019Or\u00e9al Paris, Maybelline and Garnier, as well as Mininurse, a Chinese skincare brand. At the time of her move to GSK in 2010, Advertising Age quoted company insiders surprised at her departure from L\u2019Or\u00e9al, where she was tipped for a senior global management role. Walmsley was 33rd in Fortune\u2019s 2016 list of the most powerful women outside the US \u2013 she can expect a higher ranking next year after landing the top job at GSK. She has kept a relatively low media profile, although she has revealed that she enjoys yoga and, in a GSK corporate video, said she \u201cdoesn\u2019t like the pomposity of big business language and excessive PowerPoints\u201d. Analysts believe her consumer products background probably safeguards the future of the consumer business in GSK for the time being, at a time when some investors favour a break-up of the group. The consumer healthcare division accounts for 25% of GSK\u2019s revenues, with vaccines accounting for about 15% and the main pharmaceuticals business accounting for the rest. Walmsley currently leads 21,000 workers in the business, which makes over-the-counter pain relief drugs such as Panadol, toothpaste brands including Sensodyne and Aquafresh, as well as cold and flu and smoking cessation products. When she takes on the top role at GSK, she will have a global workforce of 100,000. As manager of the Allianz UK equity income fund, Simon Gergel has a 6% stake in GSK, and says investor reaction to Walmsley\u2019s appointment will be mixed. It was positive for those who support the existing strategy of diversification, and negative for those who would prefer a demerger of the consumer arm, he said. \u201cOverall, the move reduces any dividend/strategy risk an outsider may have posed and suggests that GSK\u2019s new CEO will continue to build on the legacy of her predecessor Sir Andrew Witty.\u201d Walmsley is likely to look again at group strategy. The biggest challenges include the pressure on drugs makers to reduce prices, particularly in the US, as well as increased competition in generic drugs.",

      "bodyText": "Gaming group GVC said its \u00a31.1bn purchase of rival Bwin after a takeover battle with 888 was going better than expected, and it plans to restart paying dividends to shareholders next year. The company said first half profits more than doubled from \u20ac21.8m to \u20ac51.3m, while the integration of Bwin would lead to annual savings of \u20ac125m by the end of 2017. Chief executive Kenneth Alexander said: We believe the organic growth potential of the group is now greater than originally anticipated at the time of the bwin.party transaction acquisition. It has also won a gaming licence in New Jersey, and signed a deal with sports betting group Betfred. Meanwhile finance director Richard Cooper is leaving in February to be replaced by Wonga\u2019s Paul Miles. On the trading front it received a boost from a strong end to Euro 2016, while mobile betting jumped 55% in the half. Canaccord Genuity analysts said: Mobile sports wagers were up an impressive 55% year on year (and mobile gaming by 98%), and the group benefited from a favourable run of results - with a gross win margin up from 7.7% to 10.0%, albeit also benefiting from improvements to the trading platform It has been a period of considerable achievement for GVC. The acquisition of bwin.party has started well, with hard evidence of material revenue synergies coming through already, through more efficient marketing spend, improved VIP retention and a step up in the trading platform. In addition, the group pushed through its move to a premium listing (it joined the FTSE MidCap index this week), as well as the early agreement of a low-cost loan facility to replace its somewhat usurious Cerberus debt facility. Current trading remains strong, with revenues up by 12% in the first 11 weeks of the third quarter, or +15% on a constant currency basis, although management talks of increased marketing spend to exploit the revenue synergy opportunities from the deal. GVC has been significantly the strongest performer in the Online Gaming sector this year, up by 55% since the start of the year, or by 81% in the last 12 months. Nonetheless, it still trades on a discount valuation, on a 2017F EV/Ebitda of 9.6 times and 12.8 times PE. We raise our TP from 720p to 755p, representing a 10.0 times EV/Ebitda, versus the 10.5 times peer group average (reflecting higher unregulated revenues). Buy. Alistair Ross at Investec is also a buyer: We increase our sum of the parts target price to 760p to reflect lower integration risk. We see upside to this level due to an expected further decrease in integration risk, a better regulatory outlook and improved performance. GVC is one of the best performers in the FTSE 250, with its shares up 3.5% at 747p. Also moving higher is TalkTalk. The telecoms group has climbed 10.6p to 307.6p after analysts at Redburn moved from sell to neutral, saying the company could be a possible takeover target.",

    "sectionName": "Business", 
    "webTitle": "Sports Direct bows to pressure and agrees to independent review", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Sports Direct has bowed to shareholder pressure by agreeing to an independent review of its working practices and corporate governance. Mike Ashley, the company\u2019s founder and majority owner, admitted in a rare TV interview that he had taken his eye off the ball but claimed the problems at the company\u2019s warehouse were caused by \u201cthe odd rotten apple\u201d. The company had said the law firm Reynolds Porter Chamberlain (RPC), which carried out a preliminary review published this month, would conduct a further investigation. However, after strong shareholder backing for an independent review at the Sports Direct AGM this month, the company has now said that \u201can independent party other than RPC\u201d would conduct the review. Sports Direct\u2019s share price, which has taken a battering over the past 12 months, rose about 3% after the announcement and Ashley\u2019s BBC Breakfast interview, to 290p. Ashley was forced to look into his company\u2019s working practices after a Guardian investigation exposed a climate of fear at its warehouse in Shirebrook, Derbyshire. MPs later compared it to a Victorian workhouse. RPC has worked extensively for Ashley and Sports Direct, which is one of its biggest clients. Its report, published the day before Sports Direct\u2019s AGM, criticised the company and prompted Ashley to apologise to staff for practices that were \u201cpotentially oppressive\u201d at its warehouse. The company also said a worker representative would be elected to the board by all staff \u201cdirectly engaged or employed by Sports Direct\u201d. Ashley announced plans to put an employee on the board to show his willingness to listen to staff after the Guardian\u2019s revelations and a campaign by the Unite union battered his company\u2019s reputation. Ashley said he had not known about the poor treatment of employees but claimed there was little wrong at Sports Direct and that its reputation had been brought low by a few mistakes. He told BBC Breakfast on Tuesday: \u201cIt is odd, isolated instances. It\u2019s the odd rotten apple in the barrel and then you say: \u2018OK, I\u2019ve got to go and find the rotten apple in the barrel\u2019 \u2026 I\u2019m now coming in to work very closely with HR, the warehouse and the [employment] agencies.\u201d Ashley said Sports Direct had paid out more than \u00a3200m in staff bonuses in the past five years and that one cleaner had received \u00a380,000 in addition to her standard pay. He said his job was to fix the few things the company had done wrong to bring them up to the standard of what it had done right. \u201cI\u2019ve taken my eye off the ball. I\u2019ve said I\u2019m going to fix it and I will.\u201d A union resolution at Sports Direct\u2019s AGM calling for a fully independent review was supported by a majority of independent shareholders. After the AGM on 7 September, large shareholders told the board they wanted the review carried out by an independent party. The company said it would consult shareholders about the terms and timing of the review. Options include bringing in another law firm or a senior individual, as the Co-operative Bank did when it appointed Sir Christopher Kelly, a former civil servant, to write a report on its near-collapse, at a cost of \u00a34.4m. Sports Direct had said the review would take up to a year but shareholders, coordinated by the Investor Forum, want it completed more quickly. Andy Griffiths, the Investor Forum\u2019s executive director, said: \u201cOur members believe this is an opportunity to bring about meaningful and lasting change, and are committed to working constructively with the board and the independent reviewer to ensure it can be a turning point in rebuilding trust.\u201d An unprecedented 57% of independent shareholders failed to support the Sports Direct chairman, Keith Hellawell, at the AGM, but Ashley insisted he was staying in the role for at least another year and that they would work together to improve the way the sports chain was managed. At the AGM, Ashley at one point said the retailer\u2019s problems had been caused by Unite and hinted that he might walk away from the company he founded in 1982 if he was unable to improve the way it was run. Unite\u2019s assistant general secretary, Steve Turner, said: \u201cWe will continue to make the case that only with decent, direct employment right across the business can this company truly convince its stakeholders and the watching world that it is genuine about making the much-needed changes to practices that have shocked people everywhere.\u201d Ashley told the BBC it would take longer than a year for him to make the necessary changes but that he was listening to shareholders, who called for the independent review as a condition for Hellawell staying on. \u201cI had to support Keith Hellawell at the AGM to give him an opportunity for another year and he said if he doesn\u2019t get the support of independent shareholders he will go. Dave Forsey [the chief executive] lost his bonus, which was \u00a33m or \u00a34m. We take this a lot more personally than anyone can possibly imagine.\u201d There was also a protest vote against Sports Direct\u2019s three other non-executive directors. More than 30% of independent shareholders failed to back their reappointment amid widespread concern that they had not held Ashley to account. Ashley defended his use of a helicopter and private plane when Sports Direct workers were on low pay and zero-hours contracts. \u201cI do like to go by plane and by private plane. People will say: \u2018How can you have a plane when your workers are on the minimum wage?\u2019 I say: \u2018I don\u2019t set the minimum wage.\u2019 If the minimum wage should be the the living wage then the government, who set the rules, should set it at the living wage.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>Sports Direct has bowed to shareholder pressure by agreeing to an independent review of its working practices and corporate governance.</p> <p>Mike Ashley, the company\u2019s founder and majority owner, admitted in a rare TV interview that he had taken his eye off the ball but claimed the problems at the company\u2019s warehouse were caused by \u201cthe odd rotten apple\u201d.</p> <p>The company had said the law firm Reynolds Porter Chamberlain (RPC), <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/sep/06/sports-direct-to-ditch-zero-hours-contracts\">which carried out a preliminary review published this month</a>, would conduct a further investigation. However, after strong shareholder backing for an independent review at the Sports Direct AGM this month, the company has now said that \u201can independent party other than RPC\u201d would conduct the review.</p> <p>Sports Direct\u2019s share price, which has taken a battering over the past 12 months, rose about 3% after the announcement and Ashley\u2019s BBC Breakfast interview, to 290p.</p> <p>Ashley was forced to look into his company\u2019s working practices after a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/dec/09/sports-direct-warehouse-work-conditions\">Guardian investigation exposed a climate of fear at its warehouse in Shirebrook</a>, Derbyshire. MPs later compared it to a Victorian workhouse.</p> <p>RPC has worked extensively for Ashley and Sports Direct, which is one of its biggest clients. Its report, published the day before Sports Direct\u2019s AGM, criticised the company and prompted Ashley to apologise to staff for practices that were \u201cpotentially oppressive\u201d at its warehouse.<br></p> <p>The company also said a worker representative would be elected to the board by all staff \u201cdirectly engaged or employed by Sports Direct\u201d. Ashley announced plans to put an employee on the board to show his willingness to listen to staff <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/dec/09/how-sports-direct-effectively-pays-below-minimum-wage-pay\">after the Guardian\u2019s revelations</a> and a campaign by the Unite union battered his company\u2019s reputation.</p> <p>Ashley said he had not known about the poor treatment of employees but claimed there was little wrong at Sports Direct and that its reputation had been brought low by a few mistakes. </p> <p>He told BBC Breakfast on Tuesday: \u201cIt is odd, isolated instances. It\u2019s the odd rotten apple in the barrel and then you say: \u2018OK, I\u2019ve got to go and find the rotten apple in the barrel\u2019 \u2026 I\u2019m now coming in to work very closely with HR, the warehouse and the [employment] agencies.\u201d</p> <p>Ashley said Sports Direct had paid out more than \u00a3200m in staff bonuses in the past five years and that one cleaner had received \u00a380,000 in addition to her standard pay. He said his job was to fix the few things the company had done wrong to bring them up to the standard of what it had done right.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve taken my eye off the ball. I\u2019ve said I\u2019m going to fix it and I will.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/dec/09/how-sports-direct-effectively-pays-below-minimum-wage-pay\">Revealed: how Sports Direct effectively pays below minimum wage</a> </p> </aside>  <p>A union resolution at Sports Direct\u2019s AGM calling for a fully independent review was supported by a majority of independent shareholders. After the AGM on 7 September, large shareholders <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/sep/09/sports-directs-biggest-investors-want-independent-review-mike-ashley-keith-hellawell\">told the board they wanted the review carried out by an independent party</a>.</p> <p>The company said it would consult shareholders about the terms and timing of the review. Options include bringing in another law firm or a senior individual, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/apr/30/co-op-bank-report-poor-management-over-ambition\">as the Co-operative Bank did when it appointed Sir Christopher Kelly, a former civil servant, to write a report on its near-collapse, at a cost of \u00a34.4m</a>. Sports Direct had said the review would take up to a year but shareholders, coordinated by the Investor Forum, want it completed more quickly. </p> <p>Andy Griffiths, the Investor Forum\u2019s executive director, said: \u201cOur members believe this is an opportunity to bring about meaningful and lasting change, and are committed to working constructively with the board and the independent reviewer to ensure it can be a turning point in rebuilding trust.\u201d </p> <p>An unprecedented 57% of independent shareholders failed to support the Sports Direct chairman, Keith Hellawell, at the AGM, but Ashley insisted he was staying in the role for at least another year and that they would work together to improve the way the sports chain was managed.<br></p> <p>At the AGM, Ashley at one point said the retailer\u2019s problems had been caused by Unite and hinted that he might walk away from the company he founded in 1982 if he was unable to improve the way it was run.<br></p> <p>Unite\u2019s assistant general secretary, Steve Turner, said: \u201cWe will continue to make the case that only with decent, direct employment right across the business can this company truly convince its stakeholders and the watching world that it is genuine about making the much-needed changes to practices that have shocked people everywhere.\u201d<br></p> <p>Ashley told the BBC it would take longer than a year for him to make the necessary changes but that he was listening to shareholders, who called for the independent review as a condition for Hellawell staying on.</p> <p>\u201cI had to support Keith Hellawell at the AGM to give him an opportunity for another year and he said if he doesn\u2019t get the support of independent shareholders he will go. Dave Forsey [the chief executive] lost his bonus, which was \u00a33m or \u00a34m. We take this a lot more personally than anyone can possibly imagine.\u201d</p> <p>There was also a protest vote against Sports Direct\u2019s three other non-executive directors. More than 30% of independent shareholders failed to back their reappointment amid widespread concern that they had not held Ashley to account.</p> <p>Ashley defended his use of a helicopter and private plane when Sports Direct workers were on low pay and zero-hours contracts.</p> <p>\u201cI do like to go by plane and by private plane. People will say: \u2018How can you have a plane when your workers are on the minimum wage?\u2019 I say: \u2018I don\u2019t set the minimum wage.\u2019 If the minimum wage should be the the living wage then the government, who set the rules, should set it at the living wage.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "Subdued stock markets following the Brexit vote hit UK revenues at online trading group IG, but following the news its own shares are anything but subdued. They have fallen more than 3% to 897p as it reported that its revenues from UK and Ireland fell by 1.8% to \u00a355.4m in the first quarter. But Europe rose 13% and overall revenues rose 5.1% to \u00a3111.4m. It said: Financial markets through July and August became increasingly subdued and presented limited trading opportunities for both current and new clients. The company admitted it was a challenging quarter, with the dull markets after the EU vote following a period of volatility around the referendum itself. During the voting period, IG asked clients to increase the amount of cash they were required to hold in their accounts, which dissuaded many of them from trading. In a hold note, analysts at Numis said: IG reported first quarter revenues of \u00a3111.4m, 7% below our estimate of \u00a3120.0m where our revenue forecasts for this year were materially ahead of consensus. The quarter was characterised by an unusually divergent trend in customer numbers, revenue per client and performance by geography... We are reducing our revenue estimate for this year by 4% to \u00a3500.0m (which is in line with current consensus) from \u00a3518.8m which takes our earnings per share forecast to 47.0p from 50.5p... The key IG message remains enhanced growth driven by digital marketing, superior IT. The substantial, ongoing customer growth is a good guide to long-term shareholder value creation of the group\u2019s growth strategy. IG is currently being valued at 19.7 times earnings. Shore Capital\u2019s Paul McGinnis repeated his sell recommendation: The main reason for our sell recommendation is valuation. With independent estimates of underlying market growth at 7-8% (albeit with some short term volatility), combined with periodic investment in both the trading platform and digital marketing activities, we think that a 12 month forward PE multiple of 15 times adequately captures IG\u2019s prospects. Therefore, ahead updating the model, our last published fair value of 715p remains too far below the current price for us to consider moderating our sell stance on this well-managed group. Overall the market continues to edge higher ahead of the week\u2019s key interest rate setting meetings from the US Federal Reserve and the Bank of Japan. The FTSE 100 is currently up 16.07 points at 6829.62. Airline shares are under pressure following the recent strength in the oil price amid talk of a possible agreement next week by producers to curb output, albeit crude has lost some of those gains today. And there is much scepticism that any agreement will be reached. Bjarne Schieldrop, chief commodities analyst Nordic bank SEB, said: We see no chance of a production freeze agreement materialising. If a deal nonetheless should materialise it would be a conditional deal where Iran, Libya, Nigeria and Venezuela are allowed to lift their production to 4.0 mb/d, 1.6 mb/d, 2.0 mb/d and 2.4 mb/d respectively. That would place an OPEC production \u201cfreeze cap\u201d at about 36.2 mb/d versus an August production of 33.7 mb/d. Not much of a freeze in our view. Even so, worries about rising fuel costs have sent British Airways owner International Airlines Group 12.8p lower to 403p and easyJet down 23p to \u00a310.47. The sector has also been hit by comments from Air France saying it expected further declines in bookings, partly due to recent terrorist attacks. Mining shares continue to support the market on hopes the Chinese economy would continue to grow, with BHP Billiton 20.5p better at \u00a310.43. Joshua Mahony, market analyst at IG, said: Leading the FTSE higher are a plethora of mining stocks, amid talk of an \u2018inflection point\u2019 for both commodity prices and the Chinese economy as a whole. Comments from Rio Tinto CEO Jean-Sebastien Jacques served to solidify the growing feeling that we may have seen a bottom for commodity prices, as Chinese data shows signs of improvement and Moody\u2019s upgraded their base metals view from negative to stable. Today\u2019s six year high in Chinese house price growth comes off the back of a recent outperformance in investment, factory output and retail sales figures for August. Despite improving data, the key question is whether such improvements are merely stimulus driven and as such unsustainable over the long term. Meanwhile Kingfisher has climbed 3.9p to 380.6p after the B&amp;Q owner beat first half forecasts with a 13.5% rise in underlying profits to \u00a3436m, although it pointed to uncertainty in the UK following the Brexit vote and cautioned on the outlook for France. Analysts at Stifel said: A slight beat at the pretax profit level (UK, Poland) and encouraging noises regarding the short-term progress in the Transformation programme. We do not expect consensus to change significantly today and we remain positive on the shares long term. Among the mid-caps office rental group Regus has dropped nearly 6% to 273.1p after news that founder Mark Dixon was selling a 4% stake at 275p a share.",

    "webTitle": "GSK makes Emma Walmsley most powerful woman in FTSE 100", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "GlaxoSmithKline has appointed Emma Walmsley as chief executive, making her the most powerful woman in the industry and the UK\u2019s FTSE 100 index. Britain\u2019s biggest drugs company said Walmsley would take over from Sir Andrew Witty when he retires at the end of March after eight years at the helm. Walmsley joined GSK in 2010 and runs its \u00a36bn consumer healthcare business, whose products include Sensodyne toothpaste, Horlicks malted drinks and Panadol painkillers. Walmsley will be one of just seven female chief executives in the FTSE 100. EasyJet, Imperial Brands, Whitbread, Royal Mail, Kingfisher and Severn Trent are also run by women. GSK, with a market value of \u00a380bn, is more than twice as big as the next largest female-led company, the tobacco company Imperial Brands, which is valued at \u00a337bn. Sir Philip Hampton, GSK\u2019s chairman, is leading a government-commissioned review into increasing the number of women senior executives at Britain\u2019s top companies. Part of the plan is to get more women into senior management positions who can go on to lead Britain\u2019s biggest companies. Walmsley, 47, has been a member of GSK\u2019s top executive team since 2011. Before joining GSK, she was at L\u2019Or\u00e9al, the French cosmetics company, for 17 years and has worked in the UK, Europe, China and the US. Ketan Patel, a fund manager at EdenTree Investment Management, hailed the appointment as a \u201cwatershed moment\u201d for the sector, with Walmsley becoming the first female CEO of a major global pharmaceuticals company. Patel said: \u201cThe sector has scored surprisingly poorly on diversity at the CEO level.\u201d The move came as a surprise to many investors, and as a disappointment to those who had hoped for the appointment of an outsider to push through a break-up of the company. GSK shares dipped 0.2% on the news but ended the day broadly flat. Simon Gergel, the UK equities chief investment officer at Allianz Global Investors, which has a 6% stake in GSK, said: \u201cFor those investors who have seen the company\u2019s move towards a more diversified platform in a positive light, this continuation is encouraging. However, it may disappoint investors who have been calling for GSK to sharpen its focus and demerge its consumer health arm.\u201d Other challenges awaiting Walmsley include declining returns from research and development (R&amp;D), increased competition from generic drugmakers and pricing pressure from healthcare providers, especially in the US. Hampton said: \u201cEmma is an outstanding leader with highly valuable experience of building and running major global businesses and a strong track record of delivering growth and driving performance in healthcare.\u201d Panmure Gordon analyst David Cox said: \u201cBeing an internal appointment it\u2019s less likely to bring any huge shake-ups, as external hires often like to put their stamp on things... She may face a steep learning curve on the pharma side since she has a consumer focused background, but will be surrounded by talented management. Fantastic to see a female at the top of such a significant UK company.\u201d GSK has been looking for a new chief executive since Whitty announced his departure in March. He had been under pressure to speed up turnaround plans for GSK following several years of weak financial performance and a damaging corruption scandal in China. The company has been hit by expiring patents on its top-selling Advair inhaler but reported strong second-quarter results in July. While the rest of the industry has focused on beefing up its drug portfolios, Witty has pursued a different strategy, reducing the company\u2019s reliance on blockbuster drugs in favour of high-volume, lower-priced sales of toothpaste, painkillers and other consumer products, along with vaccines. GSK struck only one big deal during Witty\u2019s tenure, the three-part, \u00a315bn transaction with Swiss rival Novartis in 2014 to pool consumer healthcare assets and exchange cancer and vaccine businesses, which was seen as an innovative move in the industry. Walmsley has overseen the creation of the consumer joint venture with Novartis. She stressed that developing new drugs remained key to the business in an in-house video interview. \u201cObviously, R&amp;D is the beating heart of our company and our success is and will continue to be defined most fundamentally by the strength of our pipeline...

      "bodyText": "Labor has committed to supporting backpacker tax legislation if the Coalition revises the policy to a more acceptable compromise \u2013 a position attacked by the Greens as destroying Australia\u2019s competitive edge. The shadow agriculture minster, Joel Fitzgibbon, said the backpacker tax policy was announced by the Coalition with no consultation or modelling, but Labor would support it if the Coalition put up an \u201cconceivable\u201d proposal. He would not nominate what tax level the opposition would accept. \u201c[The backpacker tax change] does require legislation and if the government wants to concede it got it wrong and backs down to a conceivable proposal, we would support it,\u201d Fitzgibbon told Guardian Australia. The Coalition government is reviewing a change in the tax regime for working holidaymakers which was introduced in the 2015 budget and has attracted fierce opposition from the farming and tourism industries. The Coalition initially announced that from 1 July 2016 holidaymakers would be treated as non-residents and taxed at 32.5% from their first dollar. Currently backpackers can access the tax-free threshold, the low-income tax offset and the lower tax rate of 19% for income above the tax-free threshold up to $37,000. The measure was expected to raise $540m. But after an outcry from affected industries, the government announced a review. On Monday the deputy prime minister, Barnaby Joyce, said delaying the implementation until 1 January 2017 had already cost the budget $40m. As with his superannuation policy, the treasurer, Scott Morrison, will have to get the backpacker tax changes through his party room \u2013 where the tax has met stiff opposition from members of the National party and some rural Liberals. Once a compromise is landed, the change can be either legislated or established by an Australian Tax Office ruling. But advice from the parliamentary library has suggested any ATO ruling could be challenged and legislation would provide greater legal certainty. That advice, given to the Greens senator Peter Whish-Wilson, suggested that while a tax ruling was possible, it could be overturned in court. \u201cIt would appear more likely that legislative amendment would be used to give greater legal certainty to the proposed change than through the ATO issuing a taxation ruling, which could subsequently be overturned in a court,\u201d the advice said. The Greens have called on Labor to block any change to the backpacker tax on the grounds that the favourable tax treatment of working holidaymakers ensures Australia has a \u201ccompetitive edge\u201d globally when it comes to filling labor shortages for rural industries. \u201cThe Greens oppose the backpacker tax outright and will certainly vote against any legislation the government tries to bring in,\u201d Whish-Wilson said. \u201cI have talked with some of the crossbench and they have told me that they would also oppose any legislation. \u201cThe parliament needs to oppose any backpacker tax outright, we need to keep the competitive advantage we have and not water it down. \u201cThis puts the heat on Labor. If they come out now and say that they will vote against any backpacker tax bill then the tax is dead.\u201d Morrison said the backpacker tax was an issue from one of Joe Hockey\u2019s budgets that needed to be resolved. \u201cAs you know, this came up in one of Joe\u2019s budgets and, look, I was part of the ERC [expenditure review committee] that made the decision at the time, as was Tony Abbott and others and \u2026 there was a reason to do it,\u201d Morrison told Ray Hadley on 2GB. \u201cWhen Labor increased the tax-free threshold to $18,200, backpackers from that point on basically weren\u2019t paying any tax on any of the income because they were earning less than that, so they basically were coming in not on a working holiday visa but on a tax-free holiday.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Last week\u2019s labour force figures produced the best unemployment rate for three years but also a record level of underemployment. The two different measures \u2013 one good, one bad \u2013 highlights the changing working environment, and also explains why despite unemployment falling, the amount of slack in the employment sector means wages continue to grow slower than ever. It is certainly good that the unemployment rate in August fell to 5.6% in seasonally adjusted terms, and 5.7% in trend terms \u2013 both of which were the best for three years. All other things being equal (the favourite phrase of economists), a falling unemployment rate is always better than a rising one. But one problem with the latest figures is that the three-year-low rate occurred because since the start of the year a lower percentage of people have been in the labour market. The participation rate has fallen from 65.3% last November to 64.7% in August \u2013 a difference of around 100,000 people. As the unemployment rate is the percentage of unemployed within the labour force, this means that had the participation rate stayed steady, the unemployment rate would now be higher \u2013 around 6.3% in seasonally adjusted terms and 6.1% in trend terms. Now there is only so far you can go holding the participation rate steady, but it is undeniable that the current low unemployment rate is a function of both a lower participation rate and strong part-time employment growth. Since December, in trend terms, part-time employment has risen by 105,330 jobs, while full-time employment has fallen by 21,460 jobs: And with this rise in part-time work, not surprisingly has come an increase in underemployment. In August, the underemployment ratio \u2013 which measures the percentage of employed who wish to work more hours \u2013 reached a record 9.2%, while the underemployment rate \u2013 which measures the number of underemployed as a percentage of the labour force \u2013 also hit a record high of 8.6%. One of the odd things about underemployment is it wasn\u2019t much of a thing until the 1990s recession, and even then only really became an issue anyone really cared about in the past 15-20 years. Until the start of the century there were always more unemployed than there were underemployed; now it is the opposite: The reason for the increase has been the change in employment from full-time to part-time, and the increase in the number of women in employment. In 1986 for example, 93% of men were employed full-time, so it is little wonder back then only 2.5% of male workers wanted more hours. Now just 81% of men work full-time, and 7.5% of men are underemployed. Similarly, 30 years ago, only 48% of women were in the workforce, compared to 59% now. And not surprisingly given women are more likely to be in part-time work this has also seen an increase in the numbers of women willing to work more hours. And a big and often ignored change has been the level of youth in full-time work. In the 1980s, youth were as likely to work full-time as were adults, now there is a record low number of youth working full-time: All these factors combined means that it is largely silly to compare underemployment levels further back than around 20 years. If we were to suggest underemployment was the best indicator of employment, you would be arguing that things are worse now than during the 1990 recession: But that said, the current underemployment rate does suggest there is a lot of \u201cslack\u201d in the current employment market \u2013 and it is a slackness that has increased in the past 12 months. In May 2004, the unemployment rate was 5.6%, as it is now. The underemployment rate was 7.1%. For the next 10 years the two measures largely followed each other \u2013 as the unemployment rate went down or up, so too did the underemployment rate. But that changed mid-way through 2014. First, the underemployment rate began to rise much faster, and then when the unemployment rate began to fall, the underemployment rate oddly kept rising: It means that now while the unemployment rate is where it was in May 2004, the underemployment rate is 1.5 percentage points higher than it was then. That is why the underutilisation rate (a combination of unemployment and underemployment) is also 1.5% points higher than it was in May 2004. And this is not just due to more youth working part-time, the underutilisation rate is higher for workers over 25 years of age as well: That the underutilisation rate has fallen in the past year is certainly a good thing, but that we now have a greater proportion of the labour market either wanting to work more hours or are unemployed than we did during the height of the global financial crisis highlights the weakens of the labour market. It means that any wage growth is likely to be muted for some time, as should any extra need for employment occur due to improved economic conditions, the easiest step would be to allocate more hours for workers rather than try to employ new people. There is no reason to bemoan the fall in the unemployment rate, but the rise in underemployment is likely to be an ongoing issue. And should the two measures continue to diverge, it will only serve to underscore the weakness of the unemployment rate at measuring the health of the economy.",

      "body": "<p>Last week\u2019s labour force figures produced the best unemployment rate for three years but also a record level of underemployment. The two different measures \u2013 one good, one bad \u2013 highlights the changing working environment, and also explains why despite unemployment falling, the amount of slack in the employment sector means wages continue to grow slower than ever.</p> <p>It is certainly good that the unemployment rate in August fell to 5.6% in seasonally adjusted terms, and 5.7% in trend terms \u2013 both of which were the best for three years. All other things being equal (the favourite phrase of economists), a falling unemployment rate is always better than a rising one.</p> <p>But one problem with the latest figures is that the three-year-low rate occurred because since the start of the year a lower percentage of people have been in the labour market. The participation rate has fallen from 65.3% last November to 64.7% in August \u2013 a difference of around 100,000 people.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/15/australia-didnt-have-a-great-recession-tell-that-to-young-people\">Australia didn't have a 'great recession'? Tell that to young people | Greg Jericho</a> </p> </aside>  <p>As the unemployment rate is the percentage of unemployed within the labour force, this means that had the participation rate stayed steady, the unemployment rate would now be higher \u2013 around 6.3% in seasonally adjusted terms and 6.1% in trend terms.</p> <p>Now there is only so far you can go holding the participation rate steady, but it is undeniable that the current low unemployment rate is a function of both a lower participation rate and strong part-time employment growth.</p> <p>Since December, in trend terms, part-time employment has risen by 105,330 jobs, while full-time employment has fallen by 21,460 jobs:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Employment growth - monthly (trend)\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/S4Yz8/2/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>And with this rise in part-time work, not surprisingly has come an increase in underemployment.</p> <p>In August, the underemployment ratio \u2013 which measures the percentage of employed who wish to work more hours \u2013 reached a record 9.2%, while the underemployment rate \u2013 which measures the number of underemployed as a percentage of the labour force \u2013 also hit a record high of 8.6%.</p> <p>One of the odd things about underemployment is it wasn\u2019t much of a thing until the 1990s recession, and even then only really became an issue anyone really cared about in the past 15-20 years.</p> <p>Until the start of the century there were always more unemployed than there were underemployed; now it is the opposite:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Unemployed and underemployed\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/Vcv1f/1/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p> The reason for the increase has been the change in employment from full-time to part-time, and the increase in the number of women in employment.</p> <p>In 1986 for example, 93% of men were employed full-time, so it is little wonder back then only 2.5% of male workers wanted more hours. Now just 81% of men work full-time, and 7.5% of men are underemployed.</p> <p>Similarly, 30 years ago, only 48% of women were in the workforce, compared to 59% now. And not surprisingly given women are more likely to be in part-time work this has also seen an increase in the numbers of women willing to work more hours.</p> <p>And a big and often ignored change has been the level of youth in full-time work.
