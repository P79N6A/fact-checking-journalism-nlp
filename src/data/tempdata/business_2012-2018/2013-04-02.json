      "bodyText": "Vodafone's shares hit a decade high on Tuesday on renewed rumours that the mobile phone company may be subject to a \u00a3161bn bid \u2013 which would smash previous takeover records. Shares in Vodafone were trading nearly 6% higher at 197p, the highest the shares have reached since January 2002, following speculation that two US telecom companies are plotting to take over their British rival. The shares closed at 192p. AT&amp;T and Verizon Communications are said to be preparing to launch a breakup bid for Vodafone. The Financial Times suggested the bid could be pitched at about 260p a share. If the deal goes ahead at this price, it would be the world's biggest ever corporate acquisition, dwarfing the current record holder AOL's $182bn (\u00a3120bn) takeover of Time Warner in 2000. The FT report, which cited \"usually reliable people\" that it did not identify, said Verizon would buy Vodafone's 45% stake in their Verizon Wireless US mobile joint venture, and AT&amp;T would take on the rest of Vodafone's operations in more than 60 countries around the world. Verizon issued a statement in which it said it was still interested in buying out Vodafone's stake in Verizon Wireless, but denied that it was looking to partner with AT&amp;T. Verizon said it \"does not currently have any intention to merge with or make an offer for Vodafone, whether alone or in conjunction with others\". Vodafone and AT&amp;T declined to comment on the rumour. Barclays, which is said to be putting the deal together, also declined to comment. Vodafone, which with 403 million customers is the world's second-largest mobile phone company after China Mobile (which has 720 million customers), has long been looking for a way to extract value from its stake in Verizon Wireless. It could choose to sell its Verizon stake, but if it did the British company would then be faced with a capital gains tax bill of up to \u00a320bn as the value of the investment has soared. There has also been speculation that the parent companies could fully merge. Vodafone and Verizon bosses were said to have discussed the latest iteration of this plan as recently as December, but the talks broke down over who would lead the combined company and where its headquarters would be based, according to Bloomberg. Last month Vittorio Colao, Vodafone's chief executive, said he kept \"an open mind\" about the stake and all possible solutions. He said Vodafone's board meets to review the investment at least twice a year. Richard Perry, chief strategist at Central Markets, said the latest market chatter \"has got legs to run on it\". Robin Bienenstock, an analyst at Sanford C Bernstein, said AT&amp;T is interested in buying into European markets but cautioned that \"they've always bought at quite low prices\" in previous US acquisitions. Shareholders have been increasing pressure on Vodafone to capitalise on its Verizon Wireless stake. Last month John Hempton of Australian-based hedge fund Bronte Capital attacked Vodafone for incompetently handling the Verizon investment and said the \"best outcome would be the sale of the whole of Vodafone at a good price\". In a searing critique, Hempton called for all of Vodafone's board to be sacked if it sells the Verizon Wireless stake because shareholders would suffer an \"insane\" tax bill of tens of billions of pounds. \"With the demonstrated record of failure of Vodafone over the past decade, Vodafone has surrendered its right to make a deal \u2013 any deal \u2013 which leaves management to squander the proceeds from the best asset they have \u2013 the only asset they did not manage,\" he added. Verizon Wireless paid out a $8.5bn dividend split between its parent companies last year. It follows a $10bn dividend in 2011, the first time the joint venture had paid out cash to shareholders after halting dividends to pay down debt in 2005. Analysts believe AT&amp;T is hungry to make acquisitions after its $39bn bid for T-Mobile US \u2013 which would have created America's biggest mobile operator \u2013 was blocked by competition regulators two years ago.",

The jump in their pay totals \u2013 which includes salaries, benefits, pensions and bonuses \u2013 was the result of shares being released from a long-term incentive plan (Ltip) put in place in 2010.

      "bodyText": "Extreme global poverty could be eradicated by the end of the next decade under optimistic new targets unveiled by the World Bank that have divided development experts. The bank's president, Jim Yong Kim, claimed signs of recovery in the global economy meant there was now an \"opportunity to create a world free from the stain of poverty\" by 2030. \"We are at an auspicious moment in history, when the successes of past decades and an increasingly favourable economic outlook combine to give developing countries a chance \u2013 for the first time ever \u2013 to end extreme poverty within a generation,\" he said in a speech in Washington. The World Bank's upbeat projections, defining extreme poverty as the 1.3 billion people living on less than $1.25 per day, come as governments and international institutions prepare to set new targets to update the 15-year Millennium Development Goals set by the United Nations in 2000. Faster-than-expected growth in China and some developing economies has helped the UN meet parts of its existing target for halving poverty ahead of time, but the approaching deadline for setting new priorities has sparked a fierce debate in the development community. Critics accused the World Bank of being \"very unambitious\" and obsessed with economic growth rather tackling inequality after the leak of planning documents in March that were heavily focused on free market orthodoxy as the primary solution to global poverty. The recent criticism appears to have to stung Kim into stressing a greater need for poorer people to take their share of economic growth too. \"We have to break the taboo of silence on this difficult but critically important issue,\" said Kim in his speech delivered to students at Washington's Georgetown University on Tuesday. \"Even if rapid economic expansion in the developing world continues, this doesn't mean that everyone will automatically benefit from the development process. Assuming that growth is inclusive is both a moral imperative and a crucial condition for sustained economic development.\" But those who monitor the activities of the World Bank said the new rhetoric was not matched by detailed policies to tackle inequality. \"Kim is obviously very good at using soaring rhetoric to motivate people to tackle poverty but he is still very unambitious in practice and too focused on economic growth as an end in itself,\" said Peter Chowla, a co-ordinator at the Bretton Woods Project, a campaign group set up to monitor the World Bank. \"Talk of sharing the proceeds of growth is not the same as tackling inequality, which has soared in recent decades.\" Chowla also noted that the many of the developing countries where growth has occurred, such as China and India, have been those that have been least enthusiastic in adopting World Bank prescriptions on deregulation and free trade. \"In fact, a lot of the Bank's recent focus on funding big infrastructure projects actually hark back to the bad old World Bank of the 1980s,\" he added. Other groups have argued that the whole process of setting new global goals for poverty reduction was inherently elitist and was failing to include poorer people in the process of setting priorities. World Bank officials will meet the UN secretary general this weekend in Madrid to begin the process of agreeing replacements for the Millennium Development Goals, taking advice from a working group chaired by UK prime minister David Cameron. Kim's optimistic speech in Washington was also tinged with caution about the outlook for the world economy. \"In high-income countries, headwinds from fiscal consolidation continue to drag on growth,\" he said, noting that GDP was expected to shrink in Europe this year. And Kim, whose parents are from North Korea but who grew up in the US, said tackling poverty in conflict zones was likely to prove the toughest problem of all to solve. The Bank's target of eliminating \"extreme\" poverty by 2030 does not include the poorest 3%, which it defines as being sporadic rather than structural poverty.",

He has remained out of public view ever since, but is a familiar and trusted figure in the City, where he presents the bank's story to analysts and investors. In February, Van Saun delivered the message that the restructuring job at RBS was nearly done. The bank has left the asset protection scheme, which protected its most toxic assets, it has got rid of \u00a3200bn of non-core assets in four years and has reduced the loan-to-deposit ratio to 100% - which means it only lends what takes in deposits. With the major phase of that \"biggest turnaround on the planet\" reaching its conclusion by the end of 2013, talk about Van Saun returning to his native America is beginning to circulate. The City liked the way he handled the flotation of a third of Direct Line, the insurance company which must be disposed of entirely in the coming two years to appease EU rules on state aid, and he is said to have come up with the idea of floating off RBS's US banking business Citizens in the next two years or so to appease regulators in the UK. Van Saun may now be parachuted into Citizens to prepare the US bank for a stockmarket listing. Hester will probably dangle the promise of a major selloff of RBS shares on the London stock market in front of Van Saun's successor. But word has it that he needs look no further than Nathan Bostock, the head of risk who quit two years ago for Lloyds Banking Group but then had second thoughts and decided to stay put.",

      "body": "<p>Stephen Hester, the public face of Royal Bank of Scotland, is said to have convinced Bruce Van Saun to join him at the bailed-out bank as finance director with the words: \"How would you like to join me on the biggest turnaround on the planet?\"</p> <p>It was the middle of 2009 when US banker Van Saun arrived at a bank still teetering on the brink of collapse after the October 2008 taxpayer bailout. He has remained out of public view ever since, but is a familiar and trusted figure in the City, where he presents the bank's story to analysts and investors.</p> <p>In February, Van Saun delivered the message that the restructuring job at RBS was nearly done. The bank has left the asset protection scheme, which protected its most toxic assets, it has got rid of \u00a3200bn of non-core assets in four years and has reduced the loan-to-deposit ratio to 100% - which means it only lends what takes in deposits.</p> <p>With the major phase of that \"biggest turnaround on the planet\" reaching its conclusion by the end of 2013, talk about Van Saun returning to his native America is beginning to circulate. The City liked the way he handled the flotation of a third of Direct Line, the insurance company which must be disposed of entirely in the coming two years to appease EU rules on state aid, and he is said to have come up with the idea of floating off RBS's US banking business Citizens in the next two years or so to appease regulators in the UK.</p> <p>Van Saun may now be parachuted into Citizens to prepare the US bank for a stockmarket listing.</p> <p>Hester will probably dangle the promise of a major selloff of RBS shares on the London stock market in front of Van Saun's successor.</p> <p>But word has it that he needs look no further than Nathan Bostock, the head of risk who quit two years ago for Lloyds Banking Group but then had second thoughts and decided to stay put.</p>",

The update found that firms were scaling back production in response to weak order books from both domestic and overseas customers. A separate Markit study of the eurozone found the slump in manufacturing intensifying last month, with even businesses in Germany feeling the impact of the squeeze. Most countries in the 17-nation single currency are suffering retrenchment in their manufacturing sectors, with particularly marked downturns in France, Italy and Spain \u2013 the second, third and fourth biggest eurozone economies. The overall eurozone PMI fell from 47.9 to 46.8, its lowest level in three months. The index has remained below the 50 level that separates expansion from contraction since August 2011 and analysts warned that the report pointed to a 0.3% fall in euro zone gross domestic product in the first quarter of 2013. In the UK, the manufacturing PMI edged higher from 47.9 to 48.3. Output dropped at the fastest pace since October 2012 but the prospects for new business brightened slightly. New export orders weakened for the 15th successive month amid reports of stiff competition from the US and Asia and poor demand from Europe. CIPS/Markit said there had been modest job losses in industry last month, concentrated in bigger companies. But the survey warned that cost pressures on manufacturing were increasing as a result of dearer electricity, oil and food products. James Knightley, economist at ING said the UK performance was weaker than the City had expected, suggesting \"that the sector continues to contract, which will weigh on 1Q13 GDP\". \"Meanwhile, the Bank of England lending data shows that the number of mortgage approvals dropped to 51,700 in February from 54,200 in January, but the net amount lent actually rose by \u00a3900m after a \u00a3300m increase in January. All this still points to a very subdued economy, which will keep the pressure on the BoE to do more to offset the UK's tight fiscal stance.\"",

After a week of talks since George Osborne told MPs that the government was trying to find ways to stop Laiki being \"sucked\" into the Cyprus bailout, the UK arm of Bank of Cyprus has taken over \u00a3270m of Laiki balances in the UK. As Laiki operates as a \"branch\" in the UK, its depositors were covered by the Cyprus government for the \u20ac100,000 (\u00a385,000) European-wide guarantee in savings but could have been subject to levies above that level. However, as Bank of Cyprus UK Limited is a separately capitalised, UK-incorporated bank, it is subject to UK regulation and protected by the Financial Services Compensation Scheme which guarantees up to \u00a385,000. Its customers will not be hit by any levy on accounts \u2013 possibly 60% on accounts above \u00a385,000 \u2013 or restrictions on limiting withdrawals to \u20ac300 a day. Bank of Cyprus in the UK said the customers that have transferred to it \"will not be subject to the imposition of any 'levy', 'haircut' or withdrawal restrictions applicable to deposits with banks in Cyprus\". It was not immediately clear how many accounts were above the \u20ac100,000 threshold. The announcement was made with the new Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA), which opens for the first time on Tuesday as a subsidiary of the Bank of England to oversee the banking sector after the Financial Services Authority was shut down over the weekend. Customers with overdrafts remain at Laiki. \"These accounts are now frozen at Laiki Bank UK and customers in overdraft will no longer have banking facilities at Laiki Bank UK,\" the PRA said. Mortgages and loans are not transferred either. The PRA had been working to resolve the threat after Osborne told MPs on the Treasury select committee last week that he wanted a solution for customers of the UK arm of Laiki. Under the deal in Cyprus, Laiki is being shut down. In Cyprus, Laiki customers with deposits below \u20ac100,000 will be transferred to Bank of Cyprus, the island's largest bank. The chancellor will open the new PRA with a speech at its new offices just behind the Bank of England. He will describe the new regulatory regime as \"resetting\" the UK financial. Osborne will say: \"They represent a fundamental change in how financial services will be regulated in the future. They do away with the discredited system that failed to sound the alarm as the financial system went wrong, and put in its place a new system that puts the Bank of England back in charge and that will help ensure a strong, safe and successful financial system in Britain.\"",
