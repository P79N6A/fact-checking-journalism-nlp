      "bodyText": "In Australia, the big four banks are joining the mortgage interest rate hike bandwagon to boost additional capital in what is truly a high-risk banking and financial system. Simply put, when it comes to lending, banks are facilitators. On the front end, banks\u2019 assets are generated by providing credit (debt) to homebuyers and charging a specific rate of interest. On the back end, banks have liabilities derived from depositors and wholesale lenders, fetching an interest rate which is lower than that charged to homebuyers. The banks earn the difference in revenue. Australian households owe creditors an unconsolidated $1.97tn as of the second quarter of 2015, comprised primarily of mortgages with a remainder of personal loans. Relative to GDP, this amounts to 121.5%, and the proportion increased by 150 basis points every quarter over the past year. Given this historically and internationally large stock of household debt, the banks are earning mega dollars via net interest rate margins. Australian banks are raking in record-breaking profits due to the sheer volume of mortgage debt issued to homebuyers and residential property investors. This is the primary reason housing prices in Australia are at record levels, relative to inflation, rents and household income: a housing bubble generated by debt-financed speculation. Today, our banks are more exposed to the risk of a shock to the housing market than in any other moment in Australia\u2019s economic history. There are various reasons for banks to increase mortgage interest rates without a shift in the cash rate set by the Reserve Bank. In Australia\u2019s case, policymakers and the prudential regulator, Apra, woke up \u2013 17 years too late. They finally realised our banks would not be able to withstand a financial shock based on the colossal stock of mortgage and other debts on their balance sheets relative to the amount of security they have to defend their businesses in the event of a severe economic downturn. To improve the ability of the big four banks to weather a financial storm, Apra has told them to hold more capital against the risks they have accumulated by lending out so much debt to the household sector. This explains the raising of capital to marginally reduce the risks inherent to each of their balance sheets, valued into the hundreds of billions of dollars. Put another way, this would be like asking someone who lives payday to payday with a $400,000 mortgage, earning $70,000 a year with only $10,000 in savings, to put an extra $20 a week away in the kitty. If he or she loses their job, they are then supposed to magically come up with thousands of dollars to continue to fund the mortgage payments and other living expenses while looking for work. It makes no sense because the individual has placed themselves in a situation where they live beyond their means and increasing liquidity buffers will simply not be enough. For many Australians, it may sound reassuring that Apra is seeking to make the banks fundamentally stronger \u2013 but there is bad news. With the implementation of macroprudential regulations, our banks will now go from being as fundamentally weak as the failed Anglo Irish Bank in 2007 to now holding enough capital to rival the risk profile of what was a much safer and famed global financial institution \u2013 Lehman Brothers. In the short term, it\u2019s not going to help and the RBA should have never cut the cash rate to record lows to stimulate the already vastly overvalued and overleveraged housing sector at the cost of screwing depositors. If anything, the big four banks are too big to fail. Their mortgage books are too large to save without nationalisation, regardless of RBA backstops and bailout mechanisms already in place \u2013 namely the so-called committed liquidity facility. According to the Basel agreements that bind banking institutions around the world, banks may make their own internal (opaque) assessments of the future risk of default for home owners. Australia\u2019s big four banks and Apra are particularly fond of this method, and the vast majority of housing loans in the mortgage portfolio are assessed using the internal ratings-based (IRB) approach that allows estimates of probability of default, loss given default and exposure at default. Unfortunately the Basel algorithm to assess a banks internal risk profile is not specifically designed for a banking system so heavily leveraged towards a housing market like Australia\u2019s. Hence the methodology more than likely underestimates the true risks that lie within our banks\u2019 balance sheet while they continue to allow property speculators to increase leverage. A clear example is that buyers can still unlock newly found (but illiquid) equity of properties in their portfolios to be pledged as 20% collateral against a new mortgage for another purchase. This is a pyramid or Ponzi scheme, that puts the speculator at risk of owing more to a bank than their property portfolio is worth (negative equity). This presents a clear and present danger to the banking and financial system, depositors, taxpayers and welfare of millions of Australians who have borrowed on a large scale as residential land prices escalate. The horse well and truly bolted from the stable a long time ago, and Apra is conducting 11th hour operations to save face.",

      "bodyText": "The US Department of Agriculture (USDA) has opened an investigation into the American Egg Board (AEB) after revelations by the Guardian that the USDA-appointed group conducted a months-long campaign against a San Francisco food startup called Hampton Creek. Joanne Ivy, CEO of the AEB and 2015\u2019s Egg Person of the Year, has stepped down and taken early retirement. She was originally due to leave at the end of the year. The investigation comes after Utah senator Mike Lee called for an investigation into reports that the government-backed egg lobby had organized a concerted effort to tackle Hampton Creek, a company described in leaked emails as a \u201cmajor threat\u201d and \u201ccrisis\u201d for the $5.5bn-a-year egg industry. \u201c[R]ecent news reports have brought to light a series of emails, obtained under the Freedom of Information Act [Foia], that contain compelling evidence that AEB leadership, including the Egg Board\u2019s president and CEO, may have violated the federal laws and administrative regulations governing checkoff programs,\u201d Lee wrote in a letter to agriculture secretary Tom Vilsack, calling for the investigation. A USDA official confirmed an investigation was now under way by its agricultural marketing service (AMS) arm, which carries out the day-to-day oversight of boards. \u201cAMS is conducting a thorough administrative review of issues involving the American Egg Board. This involves a substantial amount of material, and while AMS expects to complete the review in an expeditious manner, a complete review will take some time. AMS will not comment on personnel matters involving the board,\u201d said a USDA spokesperson. Emails obtained through a Foia request by attorney Jeffrey Light and passed to the Guardian showed what Lee called \u201ca strategic, multifaceted campaign to use the power and resources of the federal government to undermine the economic prospects of Hampton Creek\u201d. Members of AEB leadership are alleged to have tried to prevent the sale of Hampton Creek\u2019s product Just Mayo at Whole Foods; to have advised Unilever on its lawsuit against the company (including suggesting Unilever solicit action from the Food and Drug Administration); and to have assessed the company\u2019s patents for flaws. They also joked about killing Tetrick himself: \u201cCan we pool our money and put a hit on him?\u201d asked Mike Sencer, executive vice-president of AEB member organization Hidden Villa Ranch. Mitch Kanter, executive vice president of the AEB, jokingly offered \u201cto contact some of my old buddies in Brooklyn to pay Mr Tetrick a visit\u201d. (AEB apologized for those statements when contacted by the Guardian.) Board executives also discussed whether to confront chef Andrew Zimmern, who had featured Hampton Creek on his popular Travel Channel show Bizarre Foods and praised the company in a blog post characterized by them as a \u201clove letter.\u201d While the Egg Board is a \u201ccheckoff\u201d organization into which egg farmers are required to pay, it is specifically prohibited from influencing governmental action or disparaging non-egg commodities. The AEB also distributed pro-industrial farming talking points through food and recipe blogs to counteract Hampton Creek chief executive Josh Tetrick\u2019s criticism in the media of industrial farming. Tetrick said he hoped the investigation would encourage more environmentally friendly farming practices. \u201cSome, not all, of these checkoff programs act in a way that is not aligned with building a healthier and more sustainable food system,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s our hope that this is the first step toward reforming them. The actions that were in this case against Hampton Creek are actually against building a food system that\u2019s for everyone.\u201d Just Mayo, a plant-based egg substitute, does not fall under the jurisdiction of the American Egg Board. But it caused consternation among its members, especially when Hampton Creek began to win lucrative industry contracts.

      "bodyText": "Sports Direct has brought Direct Golf, a specialist retailer, out of administration after a battle for control with its founder, John Andrew. Direct Golf UK and its parent company, Powerhouse Golf, were put into administration this month after the discovery of accounting irregularities which effectively rendered the business insolvent. Philip Duffy, the managing director of Duff &amp; Phelps who was appointed as joint administrator, said the company had come under \u201cserious cash flow pressure as a result of significant accounting issues that will require further detailed investigations by the administrators\u201d. \u201cAs a result the business was in danger of ceasing to trade and therefore a sale of the business and assets had to be concluded as quickly as possible,\u201d he said. The appointment of administrators from Duff &amp; Phelps, who were advising Sports Direct, was controversial. Andrew, who owned 75% of Powerhouse Golf as well as a number of its stores, had already filed a notice to appoint an alternative administrator. He has claimed that Sports Direct changed the locks on the company\u2019s head office in Milnsbridge, Huddersfield, while he was away at a meeting. Sports Direct took a stake in Powerhouse Golf last year and invested more than \u00a32.25m in the company, according to documents filed at Companies House. It is understood that the retailer, backed by the Newcastle United owner, Mike Ashley, had planned to invest more in the business but balked on discovery of the accounting problems. The problems came to light after Powerhouse Golf reported a 76% dive in profits and sales slid 13% to \u00a321.4m in the year to the end of September 2014. Despite the profits fall, the directors, led by Andrew, said in the accounts that they were \u201cexcited and very positive about the future growth of the group\u201d after embarking on a collaboration with Sports Direct. The company, which had become one of the UK\u2019s leading golfing goods retailers since Andrew founded it in 1999, is understood to have fallen into administration owing large amounts to HM Revenue &amp; Customs, landlords and its suppliers.

      "bodyText": "TalkTalk is facing increasing criticism after belatedly admitting it was the victim of a \u201csignificant and sustained\u201d cyber-attack that has led to the theft of the credit card and bank details of up to 4 million customers. The telecoms giant warned that the stolen customer data may not have been securely encrypted and that it had received a ransom demand from someone who claimed to have carried out the corporate hack. During a round of media interviews on Friday, Talk Talk\u2019s chief executive, Dido Harding, said: \u201cI personally received a contact from someone purporting \u2013 as I say, I don\u2019t know whether they are or are not \u2013 to be the hacker, looking for money.\u201d Asked by the BBC whether customers\u2019 bank details had been encrypted by TalkTalk, she said: \u201cThe awful truth is, I don\u2019t know\u201d. \u201cWith the benefit of hindsight, were we doing enough? Well, you\u2019ve got to say that we weren\u2019t and obviously we will be looking back and reviewing that extremely seriously.\u201d Customers were being advised to contact their bank and Action Fraud, the national fraud and internet crime reporting centre, if they noticed unusual activity on their accounts. They were also urged to change their TalkTalk account passwords and any other accounts that used the same passwords. It is the company\u2019s third major security breach in the past year. In December 2014, customers received India-based scam calls after the first breach. It happened again in February, with TalkTalk customers being subject to further scams despite the company describing the information that was stolen in the breach as limited and non-sensitive. The information commissioner, who is already investigating the previous two security breaches, criticised TalkTalk for taking more than 24 hours to tell his office what had happened. Christopher Graham told BBC Radio 4\u2019s World at One: \u201cI wish we had heard a little bit earlier and we could have been more \u2018out there\u2019 giving advice to consumers about what they need to protect their personal information.\u201d Harding said the firm acted as promptly as it could because it was not initially aware that a hack was taking place. \u201cOn Wednesday lunchtime, all we knew was that our website was running slowly and that we had the indications of a hacker trying to attack us,\u201d she said. Experts said it was conducted by a denial of service (DDoS) attack. Tim Smith, partner and head of technology, media and telecoms at the insurance law firm BLM, said: \u201cThese types of attacks are becoming increasingly common in the UK and it is not at all unusual to find that hackers use an initial DDoS to distract a business\u2019s IT team and then follow up with a second attack trying to steal information. \u201cThis underlines how at risk businesses are and how important it is to take all precautionary measures to protect customer data.\u201d TalkTalk Mobile customers were affected by an attack on Carphone Warehouse systems in August, in which the personal information of up to 2.4 million customers was stolen. The Information Commissioner\u2019s Office can impose monetary penalties for data breaches, capped at \u00a3500,000, as well as enforcement notices. While there is no specific requirement for firms to encrypt data, Graham indicated that there could be a bigger penalty from the watchdog if it believed the customer information on TalkTalk\u2019s systems was not secure. Referring to the \u00a3250,000 penalty imposed on Sony Corporation after it was found that leaked PlayStation customer data had not been encrypted, he said: \u201cPeople have got to take this seriously\u201d. Harding apologised to customers for the latest cyber-attack, but said the three breaches in the past year were unrelated. TalkTalk shares closed down 4% on Friday. Harding said the attack should be treated as a crime. \u201cWhether it is the US government, Apple, [or] a host of companies, cybercrime is something we all need to get better at defending ourselves against,\u201d she said. The Metropolitan police cybercrime unit has launched an investigation into the breach, although there was little firm information available about the hackers. Adrian Culley, a former detective at Scotland Yard\u2019s cybercrime unit, said the hack appeared to be the work of Islamist militants after a group claimed responsibility for the attack in the name of Allah. He told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme: \u201cIt appears at face value to be Islamic cyberterrorism.\u201d The claim could not be verified, but Culley pointed out that a group calling itself \u201cTalkTalk Hackers\u201d published what it claimed was a sample of dozens of email addresses and national security numbers as proof of the attack. The group posted the message on the site Pastebin, which is often used by hackers for publishing large amounts of information. The message used the rhetoric of Islamist militants to justify the hack, saying: \u201cWe will teach our children to use the web for Allah \u2026 your hands will be covered in blood \u2026 judgment day is soon\u201d. Prof Peter Sommer, from De Montfort University\u2019s cybersecurity unit, told the Today programme: \u201cIt seems to me the suggestion that these are Islamic terrorists who are perpetrating it is unlikely, [though] not impossible. \u201cOne has to look at what is probably the most likely outcome. One of them is an extortion attempt; since they have gone public I suspect that\u2019s not going to work. The other one is just to get hold of the credit card information, get hold of the personal information.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Downing Street has insisted that the week-long Chinese state visit secured \u201cup to \u00a340bn\u201d of trade and investment deals, after scrambling for much of Friday to substantiate the figure, brandished by David Cameron at a trade mission in Mansion House. The business secretary, Sajid Javid, said earlier this week that President Xi Jinping\u2019s visit would increase trade and investment between Britain and China by \u00a325bn; but the figure had leapt to \u00a340bn by the time the prime minister spoke on Wednesday. No 10 officials remained coy throughout much of Friday about precisely how that figure had been arrived at, claiming repeatedly that full details would be published when the state visit had officially ended. A statement was finally released after 6pm, detailing a long list of deals, including a promise from Chinese firm HNA to buy \u00a31.4bn-worth of Rolls-Royce jet engines, to be built in Derby; and \u00a36bn worth of investment in the Hinkley Point nuclear power plant. But some of the agreements had a familiar ring about them. A \u00a31bn memorandum of understanding about a \u201cgarden of ideas\u201d \u2013 a pleasure garden to be built in China, in association with the Eden Project \u2013 appeared strikingly similar to a deal signed, in the presence of George Osborne, in 2014. Doubts were also raised about \u00a36bn of investment \u201cto help fund regenerative medicine and tissue engineering research with Oxford University\u201d \u2013 apparently the same deal announced by the university earlier this week as worth just \u00a31.5m. No 10 said this was based on the Chinese bank behind the investment pencilling in a total of \u00a36bn. The decision by Chinese firm Sanpower, which owns House of Fraser, to open the department store\u2019s first branches in China was first reported in April \u2013 and ultimately involves a Chinese investor, expanding in its own domestic market, albeit behind a British shopfront. Other items referred to Chinese cash \u201cunlocking\u201d investment, before apparently listing the total value of the project in question, for example: \u201cHualing\u2019s investment will unlock three major regeneration projects in Leeds, Manchester and Sheffield with a combined gross development value of \u00a31.2bn.\u201d The government also trumpteted an announcement by BP that it would sell China\u2019s Huadian Corporation up to 1m tonnes of liquid natural gas each year, valued at \u00a36.5bn; but the income from it will be spread over two decades. The previous public statement from UKTI, the government\u2019s trade and investment arm, referred to deals worth \u201c\u00a3BILLIONS\u201d, and press officers spent the day referring all enquiries to Downing Street. Osborne has been keen to secure fresh Chinese investment, including in his \u201cnorthern powerhouse\u201d project. On a recent trip to the city of Chengdu, he opened up what he called a \u201cnorthern pitchbook\u201d, encouraging firms to bid on everything from construction of the HS2 high-speed rail link, to a new science park in Newcastle. But the welcome accorded to the Chinese delegation was particularly controversial, taking place against the backdrop of thousands of job cuts in a steel industry which blames Chinese cut-price competition for its demise. Other deals that had been highlighted during the trip, including a commitment by BBC Worldwide to make a number of programmes including a Chinese version of the long-running series Coast, were not listed by the government because of, \u201ccommercial sensitivities or confidentiality\u201d. Speaking at the UK-China business summit earlier in the week at which many of the deals were signed, Javid said: \u201cA forum like this where business leaders from both countries can come together and make deals for our mutual benefit is greatly rewarding for the prosperity of all our people.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>Downing Street has insisted that the week-long Chinese state visit secured \u201cup to \u00a340bn\u201d of trade and investment deals, after scrambling for much of Friday to substantiate the figure, brandished by David Cameron at a trade mission in Mansion House.</p> <p>The business secretary, Sajid Javid, said earlier this week that President Xi Jinping\u2019s visit would increase trade and investment between Britain and China by \u00a325bn; but the figure had leapt to \u00a340bn by the time the prime minister spoke on Wednesday.</p> <p>No 10 officials remained coy throughout much of Friday about precisely how that figure had been arrived at, claiming repeatedly that full details would be published when the state visit had officially ended. </p> <p>A statement was finally released after 6pm, detailing a long list of deals, including a promise from Chinese firm HNA to buy \u00a31.4bn-worth of Rolls-Royce jet engines, to be built in Derby; and \u00a36bn worth of investment in the Hinkley Point nuclear power plant.</p> <p>But some of the agreements had a familiar ring about them. A \u00a31bn memorandum of understanding about a \u201cgarden of ideas\u201d \u2013 a pleasure garden to be built in China, in association with the Eden Project \u2013 appeared strikingly similar to a deal <a href=\"http://www.gardenofideas.org/mou-signing-with-chinese-partners.html\">signed, in the presence of George Osborne, in 2014</a>.</p> <p>Doubts were also raised about \u00a36bn of investment \u201cto help fund regenerative medicine and tissue engineering research with Oxford University\u201d \u2013 apparently the same deal announced by the university earlier this week as worth just \u00a31.5m. No 10 said this was based on the Chinese bank behind the investment pencilling in a total of \u00a36bn.</p> <p>The decision by Chinese firm Sanpower, which owns House of Fraser, to open the department store\u2019s first branches in China <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/retailandconsumer/11553281/House-of-Fraser-to-open-shops-in-China.html\">was first reported in April</a> \u2013 and ultimately involves a Chinese investor, expanding in its own domestic market, albeit behind a British shopfront.</p> <p>Other items referred to Chinese cash \u201cunlocking\u201d investment, before apparently listing the total value of the project in question, for example: \u201cHualing\u2019s investment will unlock three major regeneration projects in Leeds, Manchester and Sheffield with a combined gross development value of \u00a31.2bn.\u201d</p> <p>The government also trumpteted an announcement by BP that it would sell China\u2019s Huadian Corporation up to 1m tonnes of liquid natural gas each year, valued at \u00a36.5bn; but the income from it will be spread over two decades. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/oct/23/xi-visit-china-dominant-partner-commercial-coupling\">Xi visit shows China is dominant partner in a purely commercial coupling</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The previous public statement from UKTI, the government\u2019s trade and investment arm, referred to deals worth \u201c\u00a3BILLIONS\u201d, and press officers spent the day referring all enquiries to Downing Street.</p> <p>Osborne has been keen to secure fresh Chinese investment, including in his \u201cnorthern powerhouse\u201d project. On a recent trip to the city of Chengdu, he opened up what he called a \u201cnorthern pitchbook\u201d, encouraging firms to bid on everything from construction of the HS2 high-speed rail link, to a new science park in Newcastle. </p> <p>But the welcome accorded to the Chinese delegation was particularly controversial, taking place against the backdrop of thousands of job cuts in a steel industry which blames Chinese cut-price competition for its demise. </p> <p>Other deals that had been highlighted during the trip, including a commitment by BBC Worldwide to make a number of programmes including a Chinese version of the long-running series Coast, were not listed by the government because of, \u201ccommercial sensitivities or confidentiality\u201d.</p> <p>Speaking at the UK-China business summit earlier in the week at which many of the deals were signed, Javid said: \u201cA forum like this where business leaders from both countries can come together and make deals for our mutual benefit is greatly rewarding for the prosperity of all our people.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "A group of record labels will receive $90m from Pandora to settle a dispute over the use of recordings created before 1972. The labels \u2013 ABKCO Music &amp; Records, Capitol Records, Sony Music Entertainment, UMG Recordings and Warner Music Group \u2013 were represented by the Record Industry Association of America, and argued that Pandora was violating copyright laws in not paying royalties on music that was more than 43 years old. Songs released after 1972 are protected by federal copyright laws, but the laws concerning music created prior to that vary state-to-state. The RIAA argued that states including California and New York recognize the copyrights of older recordings and that Pandora was in violation of those copyrights. Brian McAndrews, Pandora\u2019s CEO, said that the music streaming site was \u201cexcited to have found a resolution\u201d with the record labels that filed their suit in April 2014. But the settlement only authorizes Pandora to use the songs through 2016. For the years beyond that, the streaming service will have to work out future deals with the labels, with whom McAndrews said Pandora hopes to \u201ccontinue to foster a better, collaborative relationship\u201d. The settlement also negatively affected Pandora\u2019s quarterly earnings. According to the Los Angeles Times, their shares fell by almost 20% in after-hours trading on Wall Street. This followed the company posting a third-quarter loss of $85.9m on revenue of $311.6m. This agreement marks the latest in a debate over the use of older music. The 1960s band the Turtles are in the middle of a lawsuit against Pandora over use of their music. ABS Entertainment, the company that owns recordings by Al Green and others, is pressing charges against CBS Radio, iHeartMedia and Cumulus. And the same coalition of record labels that reached a settlement with Pandora, also received $210m from the satellite-radio company Sirius XM in June over the use of pre-1972 songs. According to the RIAA chairman and CEO, Cary Sherman, both settlements ensure \u201cthat an iconic generation of artists and the labels that supported them will be paid for the use of their creative works\u201d. He added: \u201cThat is a significant milestone and a big win for the music community.\u201d",

    "webTitle": "TalkTalk criticised for poor security and handling of hack attack", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "TalkTalk has displayed a disregard for the safety of its customers\u2019 data, according to security experts who say the telecoms firm has mishandled its response to being hacked. The attack happened on Wednesday, and TalkTalk informed the police the same day but only alerted the UK\u2019s data protection watchdog on Thursday afternoon, leading to criticism from several experts. Justin Harvey, chief security officer of Fidelis, said: \u201cIt shouldn\u2019t have taken the police to get involved for TalkTalk to own up to the problem. In the meantime their customers\u2019 identities have been exposed. \u201cThe sheer number of people that will be affected by this breach, in a personal and business capacity, means that it will be one of the defining cyber-attacks of 2015.\u201d After being slow to notify customers initially, TalkTalk then leapt into action, with its chief executive, Dido Harding, giving a series of media interviews. The company also revealed it had received a ransom demand while simultaneously failing to inform customers what precisely had been stolen. Past mistakes TalkTalk has been hit by several security breaches in the last year. In December 2014 the company saw customers hit by India-based scam calls after a data breach. It happened gain in again in February, when TalkTalk customers were subjected to further scams, despite the company describing the information stolen in the breach as limited and non-sensitive. TalkTalk Mobile customers were also affected by an attack on Carphone Warehouse systems in which the personal information of up to 2.4 million customers was stolen. The sheer number of breaches raised concerns, David Emm, principal security researcher at Kaspersky Lab, said. \u201cWhat is worrying is that this is the third time TalkTalk has been compromised this year, with no apparent changes to their internal policies and security strategies.\u201d TalkTalk has been accused of several security failings, including a lack of compliance with web security standards for credit card payments and data handling, as well as network security which allowed hackers to run riot across the company\u2019s systems. Paul German, who is the Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA) vice-president of Certes Networks, said: \u201cIf TalkTalk had cryptographically segmented its security system into predefined and clearly understood fragments, the breach would have been more manageable, instead of system wide.\u201d Lack of preparation for attacks TalkTalk said a distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack \u2013 one that overwhelms a website with traffic, taking it offline \u2013 was used as a smokescreen for the attack. It is a practice that a telecoms company such as TalkTalk should have been aware of and was becoming increasingly common, according to Dave Larson, chief technology officer of DDoS prevention specialist Corero Network Security. \u201cMore frequently, theft of personal data comes on the heels of a DDoS attack, as this activity can be used to map or profile a network\u2019s existing security defences, pinpointing holes in security or vulnerabilities to capitalise on.\u201d Unencrypted data However, the fact TalkTalk has admitted that some of its customer data stolen in the attack was not encrypted has been the most surprising aspect for security experts. Greg Aligiannis, senior director of security at Echoworx, said: \u201cThe most concerning revelation from today\u2019s news is the blas\u00e9 approach to encrypting customer data. Security of sensitive information must be considered a priority by everyone, especially when the life histories of potentially millions of customers are at risk.\u201d Emm said: \u201cIt is alarming if any data is not encrypted \u2013 as it effectively hands over personal information to the attackers.\u201d The laws on the levels and types of data security that must be used by companies to protect customer data can be vague. \u201cThere is a legal obligation for companies to implement suitable security measures ... [but] it is important to stress that companies are not obliged to have state-of-the-art security technology. They only need to have security that is appropriate to the type of data they are holding and the harm that may result from the loss of that data,\u201d said Mahisha Rupan, a senior associate at the law firm Kemp Little. Black market for stolen data For the 4 million customers who have had their data stolen, the attack could be the beginning of something larger, as personal information is valuable. One man from Glasgow has already reported being a victim of scam calls a day before TalkTalk reported the breach. Raj Samani, chief technology officer for Intel Security in EMEA, said: \u201cNot only are huge amounts of stolen information readily available online, but buyers do not even have to delve into the darknet to access this information. Almost any information you can imagine can \u2013 and is \u2013 being sold online, extending far beyond credit card details.\u201d The only way forward for the company, which must rebuild consumer trust, is clear and concise communication to customers of a plan to rectify the issue. Simon Mullis, global technical lead at the security firm FireEye, said: \u201cSecurity is no longer an IT problem, it\u2019s a business issue, as the way in which a company responds to such an attack can have a huge impact on its stakeholder value. It\u2019s therefore imperative that executives have a firm plan in place to recover from data breaches when they occur, as their company\u2019s value swings in the balance.\u201d Darren White, vice-president of EMEA at the security firm Agari, said: \u201cOnly by having an effective and secure post-breach email response plan can consumers regain trust in the brand.\u201d",

In the meantime their customers\u2019 identities have been exposed.</p> <p>\u201cThe sheer number of people that will be affected by this breach, in a personal and business capacity, means that it will be one of the defining cyber-attacks of 2015.\u201d</p> <p>After being slow to notify customers initially, TalkTalk then leapt into action, with its chief executive, Dido Harding, giving a series of media interviews. The company also <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/oct/23/talktalk-cyber-attack-company-has-received-ransom-demand\">revealed it had received a ransom demand</a> while simultaneously failing to inform customers what precisely had been stolen.</p> <h2>Past mistakes</h2> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/oct/23/talktalk-breach-what-to-do-if-youre-a-customer\">TalkTalk breach: what to do if you're a customer</a> </p> </aside>  <p>TalkTalk has been hit by several security breaches in the last year.

Security of sensitive information must be considered a priority by everyone, especially when the life histories of potentially millions of customers are at risk.\u201d</p> <p>Emm said: \u201cIt is alarming if <em>any</em> data is not encrypted \u2013 as it effectively hands over personal information to the attackers.\u201d</p> <p>The laws on the levels and types of data security that must be used by companies to protect customer data can be vague.</p> <p>\u201cThere is a legal obligation for companies to implement suitable security measures ... [but] it is important to stress that companies are not obliged to have state-of-the-art security technology. They only need to have security that is appropriate to the type of data they are holding and the harm that may result from the loss of that data,\u201d said Mahisha Rupan, a senior associate at the law firm Kemp Little.</p> <h2>Black market for stolen data</h2> <p>For the 4 million customers who have had their data stolen, the attack could be the <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/oct/23/talktalk-breach-what-to-do-if-youre-a-customer\">beginning of something larger</a>, as personal information is valuable.

Almost any information you can imagine can \u2013 and is \u2013 being sold online, extending far beyond credit card details.\u201d</p> <p>The only way forward for the company, which must rebuild consumer trust, is clear and concise communication to customers of a plan to rectify the issue.</p> <p>Simon Mullis, global technical lead at the security firm FireEye, said: \u201cSecurity is no longer an IT problem, it\u2019s a business issue, as the way in which a company responds to such an attack can have a huge impact on its stakeholder value. It\u2019s therefore imperative that executives have a firm plan in place to recover from data breaches when they occur, as their company\u2019s value swings in the balance.\u201d</p> <p>Darren White, vice-president of EMEA at the security firm Agari, said: \u201cOnly by having an effective and secure post-breach email response plan can consumers regain trust in the brand.\u201d</p>",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The EU appears to have broken a promise to reinforce environmental protections in a leaked draft negotiating text submitted in the latest round of TTIP talks in Miami.. In January, the bloc promised to safeguard green laws, defend international standards and protect the EU\u2019s right to set high levels of environmental protection, in a haggle with the US over terms for a free trade deal. But a confidential text seen by the Guardian and filed in the sustainable development chapter of negotiations earlier this week contains only vaguely phrased and non-binding commitments to environmental safeguards. No obligations to ratify international environmental conventions are proposed, and ways of enforcing goals on biodiversity, chemicals and the illegal wildlife trade are similarly absent. The document does recognise a \u201cright of each party to determine its sustainable development policies and priorities\u201d. But lawyers say this will have far weaker standing than provisions allowing investors to sue states that pass laws breaching legitimate expectations of profit. \u201cThe safeguards provided to sustainable development are virtually non-existent compared to those provided to investors and the difference is rather stark,\u201d said Tim Grabiel, a Paris-based environmental attorney. \u201cThe sustainable development chapter comprises a series of aspirational statements and loosely worded commitments with an unclear dispute settlement mechanism. It has little if any legal force.\u201d The document contains a series of broadly sympathetic statements about the importance of conservation and climate action. But it offers no definitions of what core terms \u2013 such as \u201chigh levels of protection\u201d for the environment or \u201ceffective domestic policies\u201d for implementing them \u2013 actually mean. Last year, more than a million people across Europe signed a petition calling for the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) talks to be scrapped. Their concern was that multinationals could use the treaty\u2019s investor-state dispute settlement (ISDS) provisions to sue authorities in private tribunals, not bound by legal precedent. In one famous case, Lone Pine launched an unresolved $250m suit against the state of Quebec after it introduced a fracking moratorium, using ISDS provisions in the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta). US officials maintain that few such cases are ever likely to be brought under the TTIP, which could wipe away tariffs in the world\u2019s largest ever free trade deal. However, environmental cases accounted for 60% of the 127 ISDS cases already brought against EU countries under bilateral trade agreements in the last two decades, according to Friends of the Earth Europe. Europe\u2019s taxpayers paid out at least $3.5bn to private investors as a result. Natacha Cingotti, a trade campaigner for the group, said that only a carve-out of environmental protections from the tribunal process could prevent such cases mushrooming after a TTIP deal. \u201cThis new leak illustrates that the European commission is not serious about protecting essential safeguards for citizens and the environment in the context of the TTIP talks,\u201d she told the Guardian. \u201cPowerful corporate polluters are likely to get VIP treatment under it, while the only chapter that could bring strong language to protect essential regulations to build a sustainable future is weak and unenforceable.\u201d A trade deal is supposed to be clinched by the end of 2016, although the deputy US trade representative, Michael Punke, said on Wednesday that the negotiations had not been moving as \u201cconstructively and ambitiously\u201d as planned. But lawyers and campaigners fear that any further progress around the Miami table could come at the expense of environmental concerns, with the latest round of talks due to close in Miami on Friday. An EU promise that TTIP would \u201csupport our climate targets, for example by promoting trade and investment in green goods and services\u201d has already been thrown into doubt by the leak of a draft energy chapter last May. In it, Europe\u2019s negotiators pushed for \u201ca legally binding commitment in the TTIP guaranteeing the free export of crude oil and gas resources\u201d. By comparison, \u201csustainable development is being treated like an appendage or unwanted stepchild,\u201d Grabiel said. \u201cThe unequal treatment of sustainable development cannot be reconciled with the EU policy objectives in this area.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "US bank SunTrust has pulled a U-turn on a policy requiring laid-off IT workers to provide the company with assistance for no compensation for two years after they have been let go, the company told the Guardian on Friday. The \u201ccontinuing cooperation\u201d clause, first reported on by ComputerWorld magazine, would have required laid-off workers to provide the company with information or assistance for up to two years after they were let go. ComputerWorld described the clause as requiring the workers to be \u201con call for two years\u201d \u2013 a characterization that SunTrust called misleading. When asked about the clause and the employees being offered no compensation for such continued cooperation, Mike McCoy, the company spokesperson, said: \u201cWe understand that a clause in our severance agreement was misconstrued versus its use in actual practice and therefore, we have removed it.\u201d The clause originally read: \u201cFor a period of two (2) years following the end of my employment with SunTrust, I agree to provide assistance and to make myself reasonably available to SunTrust regarding matters in which I have been involved in the course of my employment with SunTrust and/or about which I have knowledge as a result of my employment with SunTrust.\u201d It went on to say that the \u201cassistance\u201d \u2013 which could include phone and in-person meetings, testimonies, interviews, trial or affidavits \u2013 would \u201cnot unreasonably\u201d interfere with the former employees\u2019 new jobs. While SunTrust would cover expenses incurred by the former employees, it would not compensate them for their time. \u201cI understand that I will not be entitled to any additional consideration or compensation of any kind from SunTrust in exchange for such assistance.\u201d SunTrust \u2013 which has close to 1,500 branches across the southern states \u2013 insisted that it rarely enforces the clause in question. \u201cIt is a rare occasion when we need to call a former employee. The \u2018continuing cooperation\u2019 clause in our severance agreements is designed to assist the company under scenarios that arise infrequently when we need access to knowledge possessed by a former employee, primarily related to regulatory or legal matters,\u201d McCoy told the Guardian, less than an hour before announcing that the clause would be removed from the severance package. \u201cSunTrust has never used this provision to require a former employee to be \u2018on call\u2019 to help conduct day-to-day business in any way.\u201d Cooperation clauses are traditionally required for executives leaving \u201chigh-level positions\u201d, Jonathan Segal, an attorney with the firm Duane Morris in Philadelphia and legislative director of the Society for Human Resource Management in Pennsylvania, told the Atlanta Journal-Constitution. \u201cThere are times that a lower-level employee has institutional knowledge that is needed later. But it is the exception, not the rule,\u201d he said. In 2009, when William Reed JR retired from his post as the vice-chairman of the Atlanta-based bank, he too was required to agree to similar clause as part of his non-compete agreement. While he would receive no compensation for any continuing assistance offered over the following two years, he did receive $100,000 for signing the non-compete agreement. Asked to confirm that it was laying off 100 IT employees, who were required to train the contractors that would replace them in the coming weeks, SunTrust neither confirmed nor denied the claim. \u201cIn terms of the question about lay-offs: like all companies, we are constantly reviewing and adjusting our operations to ensure we\u2019re meeting client needs effectively and efficiently, however we will decline to comment on any specific activities,\u201d McCoy said. According to ComputerWorld, layoffs are scheduled to begin on 1 November.",

ComputerWorld described the clause as requiring the workers to be \u201con call for two years\u201d \u2013 a characterization that SunTrust called misleading. </p> <p>When asked about the clause and the employees being offered no compensation for such continued cooperation, Mike McCoy, the company spokesperson, said: \u201cWe understand that a clause in our severance agreement was misconstrued versus its use in actual practice and therefore, we have removed it.\u201d</p> <p>The clause originally read: \u201cFor a period of two (2) years following the end of my employment with SunTrust, I agree to provide assistance and to make myself reasonably available to SunTrust regarding matters in which I have been involved in the course of my employment with SunTrust and/or about which I have knowledge as a result of my employment with SunTrust.\u201d </p> <p>It went on to say that the \u201cassistance\u201d \u2013 which could include phone and in-person meetings, testimonies, interviews, trial or affidavits \u2013 would \u201cnot unreasonably\u201d interfere with the former employees\u2019 new jobs. While SunTrust would cover expenses incurred by the former employees, it would not compensate them for their time. </p> <p>\u201cI understand that I will not be entitled to any additional consideration or compensation of any kind from SunTrust in exchange for such assistance.\u201d </p> <p>SunTrust \u2013 which has close to 1,500 branches across the southern states \u2013 insisted that it rarely enforces the clause in question.</p> <p>\u201cIt is a rare occasion when we need to call a former employee. The \u2018continuing cooperation\u2019 clause in our severance agreements is designed to assist the company under scenarios that arise infrequently when we need access to knowledge possessed by a former employee, primarily related to regulatory or legal matters,\u201d McCoy told the Guardian, less than an hour before announcing that the clause would be removed from the severance package. \u201cSunTrust has never used this provision to require a former employee to be \u2018on call\u2019 to help conduct day-to-day business in any way.\u201d </p> <p>Cooperation clauses are traditionally required for executives leaving \u201chigh-level positions\u201d, Jonathan Segal, an attorney with the firm Duane Morris in Philadelphia and legislative director of the Society for Human Resource Management in Pennsylvania, <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://business.blog.ajc.com/2015/10/20/1733/\">told the Atlanta Journal-Constitution</a>.</p> <p>\u201cThere are times that a lower-level employee has institutional knowledge that is needed later. But it is the exception, not the rule,\u201d he said.</p> <p>In 2009, when <a href=\"https://www.memphisdailynews.com/news/2009/jun/29/suntrust-execs-consulting-role-follows-other-leadership-changes//print\">William Reed JR retired from his post</a> as the vice-chairman of the Atlanta-based bank, he too was required to agree to similar clause as part of his non-compete agreement. While he would receive no compensation for any continuing assistance offered over the following two years, he did receive <a href=\"http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/750556/000129993309002639/exhibit2.htm\">$100,000 for signing the non-compete agreement</a>. </p> <p>Asked to confirm that it was laying off 100 IT employees, who were required to train the contractors that would replace them in the coming weeks, SunTrust neither confirmed nor denied the claim. </p> <p>\u201cIn terms of the question about lay-offs: like all companies, we are constantly reviewing and adjusting our operations to ensure we\u2019re meeting client needs effectively and efficiently, however we will decline to comment on any specific activities,\u201d<em tabindex=\"-1\"> </em>McCoy said. </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.computerworld.com/article/2996049/it-careers/qanda-about-suntrust-s-cooperation-clause.html\">According to ComputerWorld</a>, layoffs are scheduled to begin on 1 November. </p>",

      "bodyText": "Sainsbury\u2019s is testing out a \u201cmicrostore\u201d that could enable it to open small outlets in more than 1,000 new locations. Mike Coupe, chief executive, said the supermarket could potentially more than double the size of its chain of smaller shops if the new format, which is about a third of the size of a typical convenience store, proved successful. The first microstore, covering 1,000 sq ft, opened recently opposite the retailer\u2019s headquarters in Holborn, central London. It stocks only about 1,000 products \u2013 such as bread rolls, salads, sushi, cereal, cold meats and ready meals \u2013 that are suitable for putting together a quick meal. There are no cleaning products, cigarettes or lottery tickets. \u201cIt\u2019s focused on shopping missions for today, for now and for convenience. It\u2019s our first attempt at playing strongly to that market,\u201d said Coupe. Cigarettes and lottery tickets have been excluded as part of an effort to ensure that shoppers can pay and leave quickly during their lunch break or rush into work. Card-only self-service tills are also being tested at the store. Sainsbury\u2019s has 741 convenience stores and has said that it wants to have 1,500 in the longer term. But Coupe said the new format would open up the potential to operate in another 1,000 locations \u2013 such as city centres or commuter hubs \u2013 where it wasn\u2019t possible to place a typical convenience store that covers 3,000 sq ft. The retailer developed the new concept in just four months, as it seeks to cash in on the shift in shopping habits towards small neighbourhood stores. Two more microstores in similarly busy areas are already in the pipeline. Sales at convenience stores are expected to rise by 17% over the next five years while larger stores are set to see a 2.9% decline, according to the Institute of Grocery Distribution. Sainsbury\u2019s is also trying to cater to the trend towards convenience shopping in its larger stores. Trials at six stores in different parts of the UK have put takeaway food, bakery items, alcohol and self-checkouts together near the entrance so that shoppers can use the area like a convenience store. An upgraded version of the self scanning system, which will eventually allow shoppers to use their mobile phone to buy goods, is also being tested. The retailer has also increased the space devoted to clothing and homeware by an average of 30% in the trial stores and has put in technology service desks, an area where people can get advice on buying technology such as laptop computers, mobile phones and TVs. Fish counters, butchers and patisseries have been upgraded. Coupe said: \u201cThe majority of people still do most of their shopping in supermarkets and that\u2019s a trend that will continue, but we need to make our supermarkets more convenient for people who visit often to do a smaller shop. \u201cThis trial is about seeing how far we can go in catering for every shopping mission, whether someone wants to pop in quickly to buy a sandwich for lunch, or whether they have more time and want inspiration for home, or advice on tech and gadgets.\u201d",

    "webTitle": "China interest rate cut fuels fears over ailing economy", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "China fuelled fears that its ailing economy is about to slow further after Beijing cut its main interest rate by 0.25 percentage points. The unexpected rate cut, the sixth since November last year, reduced the main bank base rate to 4.35%. The one-year deposit rate will fall to 1.5% from 1.75%. The move follows official data earlier this week showing that economic growth in the latest quarter fell to a six-year low of 6.9%. A decline in exports was one of the biggest factors, blamed partly by analysts on the high value of China\u2019s currency, the yuan. The rate cut sent European stock markets higher as investors welcomed the boost from cheaper credit in China, together with the hint of further monetary easing by the European Central Bank president, Mario Draghi, on Thursday. Investors were also buoyed by the likelihood that the US Federal Reserve would be forced to signal another delay to the first US rate rise since the financial crash of 2008-2009 until later next year. The FTSE 100 was up just over 90 points, or 1.4%, at 6466, while the German Dax and French CAC were up almost 3%. The People\u2019s Bank of China\u2019s last rate cut in August triggered turmoil in world markets after Beijing combined the decision with a 2% reduction in the yuan\u2019s value. Shocked at the prospect of a slide in the Chinese currency, investors panicked and sent markets plunging. Some economists have warned that the world economy is about to experience a third leg of post-crash instability after the initial banking collapse and eurozone crisis. The slowdown in China, as it reduces debts and a dependence for growth on investment in heavy industry and property, will be the third leg. World trade has already contracted this year with analysts forecasting weaker trade next year. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) in July trimmed its forecast for global economic growth for this year to 3.1% from 3.3% previously, mainly as a result of China\u2019s slowing growth. The Washington-based fund also warned that the weak recovery in the west risks turning into near stagnation. At its October annual meeting, it said growth in the advanced countries of the west is forecast to pick up slightly, from 1.8% in 2014 to 2% in 2015 while growth in the rest of the world is expected to fall from 4.6% to 4%. Sanjiv Shah, chief investment Officer of Sun Global Investments, said: \u201cThe Chinese decision indicates that the authorities are clearly worried about the slowdown in the pace of economic growth and have decide to engage in more pre-emptive action. The [People\u2019s Bank of China] has cut benchmark rates and reduced banks\u2019 reserve requirements as well as scrapping deposit controls.\u201d But Mark Williams, chief Asia economist at Capital Economics, remained upbeat about the prospects for China\u2019s sustained growth, arguing that the cut in interest rates was part of a longer-term strategy and not a reaction to deteriorating growth. \u201cThe key point is that we shouldn\u2019t take today\u2019s announcement as evidence that policymakers have grown more concerned about the economy. Instead, this is a controlled easing cycle that underlines how China\u2019s policymakers, unlike many of their peers elsewhere, still have room for policy manoeuvre,\u201d he said. \u201cAdmittedly, we\u2019re still waiting for clear evidence of an economic turnaround \u2013 September\u2019s activity data still don\u2019t show any great improvement. Nonetheless, with more stimulus in the pipeline, we still believe the economy will look stronger soon.\u201d Corporations considered bellwethers of the global economy have also warned of a sharp slowdown. Caterpillar, the industrial equipment manufacturer, has seen profits slide over the last year. AP Moller-Maersk, the shipping firm cut its 2015 profit forecast by 15% on Friday, blaming a slowdown in the container shipping market. The Danish conglomerate operates Maersk Line, the world\u2019s largest container shipping company which transports roughly 20% of all goods on the busiest routes between Asia and Europe.",

      "bodyText": "On this note, we\u2019re closing up for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back next week. My colleague Julia L\u00f6hr reports that the German carmaker Opel, owned by US giant General Motor, has been caught up in the emissions-rigging scandal that has engulfed Volkswagen. Tests have shown that the Opel Zafira 1.6 CDTi model emitted up to 17 times the permitted level of nitrogen oxides, the German Environmental Aid Association said today. The car repeatedly failed emissions standards in a series of tests conducted at the University of Applied Sciences in Bern on behalf of the association. However, the carmaker firmly rejected the claims. A spokesperson insisted that Opel cars have not been fitted with a software device that recognises test situations. Chinese president Xi Jinping, meanwhile, has arrived at Manchester town hall. Back to Athens, where the French president has addressed the Greek parliament. Wall Street looks set to open higher. US stock futures have also been boosted by strong quarterly results from Google parent Alphabet, Microsoft and Amazon, which suggests tech stocks will rally when markets open in 40 minutes. Global interest rates are going in opposite directions.... China\u2019s rate cut is the sixth since last November as the authorities try to kickstart the slowing economy. The People\u2019s Bank of China has lowered its one-year benchmark bank lending rate by a quarter point to 4.35%, effective from 24 October. The one-year benchmark deposit rate was also cut by 25 basis points, to 1.5%. This is China\u2019s most aggressive policy easing cycle since the global financial crisis in 2008/09, Reuters said. European stock markets, already buoyant after the ECB\u2019s stimulus talk, are extending their rally after China\u2019s surprise rate cut. The FTSE 100 index in London is now up more than 100 points at 6481.26, a 1.6% gain. Germany\u2019s Dax is 2.1% ahead while France\u2019s CAC has added nearly 2%. The People\u2019s Bank of China has cut its benchmark interest rate by a quarter point. It has also reduced its reserve requirements. The euro is still shaky but flat since the ECB\u2019s hints of more stimulus in December. Mario Draghi\u2019s comments yesterday have pushed yields on Italian and Spanish two-year government bonds below zero \u2013 which means some investors are now paying to hold them. Draghi surprised markets when he told a press conference that the central bank had discussed lowering the deposit rate further at its meeting in Malta, and some members on the governing council hinted they wanted to cut rates this week. The ECB\u2019s latest quarterly Survey of Professional Forecasters sees inflation across the eurozone hovering just above zero this year, and still missing the ECB\u2019s 2% target over the next two years. Here in the UK, Monsoon, the fashion chain, has been named and shamed by the government for failing to pay more than 1,400 workers the national minimum wage. The privately owned firm is one of 115 companies caught in the latest swoop by HM Revenue and Customs, which oversees implementation of the pay regulations. The government list is only the tip of the iceberg, says the TUC. The union estimates that at least 250,000 workers are being denied their legal pay, and that only a quarter of offenders are being caught. TUC general secretary Frances O\u2019Grady said: It\u2019s good to see that the government is naming and shaming more companies who pay their employees less than the minimum wage. However, today\u2019s list of offenders is only the tip of the iceberg. Many more employers are getting away with illegal underpayment. I am particularly saddened to see Monsoon Accessorize acting in breach of the law. A large firm with thousands of employees has no excuse for not having proper systems in place to ensure staff get their legal wages. The government must continue to increase enforcement of the minimum wage, and ensure that all workers get what they are owed. Bosses who try to duck the minimum wage should have nowhere to hide. For employees the message is clear: strong unions in every workplace are necessary to stop these abuses.\u201d Hollande is addressing the Greek parliament. More news out of Greece, where prime minister Alexis Tsipras has welcomed the French president Fran\u00e7ois Hollande. Meanwhile, Greek two-year bond yields have fallen below 10-year yields for the first time since last December, in a sign that fears among investors that the heavily-indebted country is heading towards a debt default are easing. This summer, Greece came close to being forced out of the eurozone. The rally on European stock markets continues, following suggestions from European Central Bank president Mario Draghi yesterday that more monetary stimulus \u2013 which could take the form of more rate cuts or a boost to QE \u2013 may be on its way. Danish shipping giant A.P. M\u00f8ller\u2013Maersk has downgraded its annual profit forecast as global trade weakens. The Copenhagen-based company is seen as a bellwether for the world economy. It said global market conditions had been weaker than expected. You can read the full story here. Here in the UK, the government and Tata Steel have announced a support package of up to \u00a39m to support the local economy and employees affected by the job losses at the Scunthorpe steelworks. Tata Steel\u2019s regeneration arm UK Steel Enterprise has pledged \u00a33m to support job creation in Scunthorpe. This is being matched by the government, to fund more start-ups and businesses that are looking to expand and create jobs. In addition, the government is providing up to \u00a33m for training of steel workers who are losing their jobs, through local further education colleges. Tata Steel is cutting 900 jobs at Scunthorpe and 270 at two sites in Scotland, blaming cheap Chinese imports, the strong pound and high electricity costs. The company is also providing \u00a31.5m to support job creation in steel communities around its Dalzell and Clydebridge sites in Scotland, while the UK government is in talks with the Scottish government about further support. Business secretary Sajid Javid said: This is a very difficult time for the workforce, so it is important that the Government and the company have come together to support people and the local economy. The Government has no intention of simply standing aside whilst the steel industry faces global challenges on a scale unprecedented in recent years. We will do everything we can to help workers and to ensure a level playing field for the industry.\u201d The government has come under fire this week for wining and dining the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, while more than a thousand steel workers are losing their jobs \u2013 with China\u2019s \u201csteel dumping\u201d seen as the main culprit. German transport minister Alexander Dobrindt is heading to Washington next week for talks with US officials over the deepening scandal. He will meet his counterpart Anthony Foxx as well as officials at the Environmental Protection Agency. The EPA discovered that some of VW\u2019s diesel vehicles emitted up to 40 times the permitted level of nitrogen oxides. The scandal broke in the US, but most of the 11m affected diesel vehicles are in Europe. VW faces tens of billions of dollars in fines and compensation for drivers around the world. My colleague Julia L\u00f6hr reports that during his five-day trip, which starts next Monday, Dobrindt will also visit a test centre for driverless vehicles at the University of Michigan. He will also discuss the effects of digitalisation on the transport industry, with visits planned to BMW and Google. There is no mention in the PMI surveys of the Volkswagen emissions-rigging scandal, which has rocked the German carmaker, the world\u2019s biggest. Some economists were expecting confidence to take a hit within Germany industry. Some companies seemed more worried about Russian sanctions, as reported earlier. Looking at the detail of the eurozone recovery, survey compiler Markit explained: Output rose across both services and manufacturing, pointing to a broad-based upturn. The former sector once again recorded the stronger gain, with the divergence widening as services growth accelerated slightly but factory production showed the smallest rise for five months. Chris Williamson, chief economist at survey compiler Markit, said: The PMI brings welcome news that the eurozone economy picked up some momentum in October. With new business growing at the fastest rate for six months, firms were encouraged to boost staffing levels again. However, the PMI remains at a level signalling a modest 0.4% quarterly rise in GDP, suggesting the region will struggle to attain more than 1.5% overall growth in 2015. The rate of job creation, although on the rise, remains insufficient to make serious headway into reducing unemployment. The renewed fall in output prices meanwhile suggests that inflation will remain in negative territory as we head towards the end of the year. Unless the PMI business activity and price indices pick up significantly in coming months, the combination of relatively weak growth and deflation signalled by the survey will fuel expectations that the ECB will step up its quantitative easing programme at the December meeting.\u201d Back to the PMI surveys, which suggest that the eurozone recovery regained some momentum at the start of the fourth quarter. Key points from the eurozone composite PMI: Flash Eurozone PMI Composite Output Index at 54.0 (53.6 in September). 2-month high. Flash Eurozone Services PMI Activity Index(2) at 54.2 (53.7 in September). 2-month high. Flash Eurozone Manufacturing PMI at 52.0 (52.0 in September). Unchanged. Flash Eurozone Manufacturing PMI Output Index at 53.3 (53.4 in September). 5-month low. In London, shares in Talk Talk have crashed nearly 11% to 239.6p, wiping some \u00a3280m off the company\u2019s market value. The telecoms provider suffered a cyber attack on its website, which could affect 4 million customers in the UK. Chief executive Dido Harding has apologised to customers, but the company is unsure at the moment how many people are affected. Find out what to do if you\u2019re a customer. The eurozone composite PMI is out German manufacturing PMI hit a five-month low of 51.6, still above the 50 mark that separates expansion from contraction. Markit said the numbers \u201csignal a note of caution for German manufacturers\u201d. Oliver Kolodseike, economist at Markit, said: October\u2019s PMI results paint a fairly passive picture of the health of the German private sector economy at the start of the final quarter of 2015. Companies signalled a slight acceleration of output growth and were able to secure new contracts despite raising their charges to the greatest extent in 21 months. However, much of the strength was attributed to the service sector, where companies enjoyed the strongest rise in business activity for seven months. Meanwhile, today\u2019s numbers signal a note of caution for German manufacturers. Output and new orders increased at weaker rates, with some companies explicitly mentioning ongoing uncertainties stemming from the Russian sanctions. Moreover, the combination of rising stocks of finished goods levels and slower new order growth suggests that companies may scale down their production in coming months.\u201d Private sector firms in Germany started the fourth quarter on a solid footing, with output increasing at an accelerated pace, according to survey compiler Markit. Key points: \uf0a7 Flash Germany Composite Output Index(1) at 54.5 (54.1 in September), 2-month high. \uf0a7 Flash Germany Services Activity Index(2) at 55.2 (54.1 in September), 7-month high. \uf0a7 Flash Germany Manufacturing PMI(3) at 51.6 (52.3 in September), 5-month low. \uf0a7 Flash Germany Manufacturing Output Index(4) at 53.2 (54.0 in September), 5-month low. The German flash PMIs are out, compiled by Markit. The euro has turned lower again, slipping below $1.11. In London, bookie William Hill has warned on profits after too many favourites came home, pushing its shares down 6% to 324.7p. You can read the full story here. Economists at Daiwa have sent us their thoughts on the ECB and the French PMI data: Clearly, we had a highly significant Governing Council meeting yesterday with Draghi going almost as far as he could without actually precommitting to altering policy. While ostensibly the ECB\u2019s forthcoming forecast update will determine whether we actually see new policy action in December, Draghi sent an unambiguous signal that additional easing is highly likely. Indeed, he stated that some Governing Council members had \u2018hinted\u2019 that they wanted further stimulus already. And options on the table now not only include amendments to the ECB\u2019s asset purchase programme in terms of size, composition and duration but \u2013 in a significant U-turn \u2013 a further cut in the deposit rate. Since the ECB expects the consumer-led economic recovery to be maintained and has been encouraged by the ongoing improvement in bank lending conditions, in the absence of a new adverse shock we had expected it to agree in December simply to extend the current asset purchase programme beyond September 2016, perhaps by one further year. But doing only that would now significantly disappoint the market. e.g. 2Y Bunds have plummeted to a new low of -35bps and the euro is down more than 2 cents to $1.11, the lowest since August, starting to reverse the 7% appreciation in the trade-weighted exchange rate seen since April. Certainly, any adverse news between now and December \u2013 in terms of either economic or financial conditions \u2013 would bring the other policy options, such as an increased rate of asset purchase or a cut in the deposit rate, into play. And by maintaining the rate cut as a feasible option in December and (if it is not implemented then) beyond, short-dated yields should remain super-low and downward pressure should be maintained on the exchange rate. Indeed, in that respect, yesterday\u2019s announcement might partly be interpreted as an effective means of verbal FX intervention.\u201d Despite Draghi\u2019s dovishness, today\u2019s economic data should maintain cause for cautious optimism about the near-term economic growth outlook. The French flash PMIs for October just released surprised on the upside: contrary to expectations of declines this month, the manufacturing, services and composite indices improved. So, while the equivalent euro area PMIs were also expected to have eased somewhat from September\u2019s levels (with the euro area composite index forecast to fall 0.2pt to below 53.5 for first time since February), the risks appear now to be to the upside. And overall, they should be consistent with ongoing moderate expansion of euro area GDP circa 0.3-0.4%Q/Q in the present quarter.\u201d European stock markets have opened higher after yesterday\u2019s stimulus talk from the ECB. FTSE 100 index in London up 0.67% at 6419.25 in early trading Germany\u2019s Dax up 1.1% France\u2019s CAC up 0.8% Spain\u2019s Ibex up 0.7% Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB up 0.4% Portugal\u2019s PSi-20 up 0.6% So the French economy has clearly strengthened, with output growth across the private sector hitting a four-month high in October, which came as a surprise to economists. Jack Kennedy, senior economist at Markit, which compiles the surveys, said: French private sector output growth firmed slightly in October, underpinned by rising activity across both services and manufacturing. The data point to modest growth momentum at the start of the final quarter, following a likely small rise in GDP during Q3. However, companies continued to trim staffing levels in the latest month, pointing towards ongoing softness in the labour market.\u201d And we\u2019re off. The French PMI data are out: they are better than expected. The manufacturing PMI has edged up to 50.7 in October from 50.6 in September, while the services PMI climbed to 52.3 from 51.9. The composite PMI, which comprises both sectors, also improved, to 52.3 from 51.9. The research team at Danske Bank have looked at the manufacturing surveys: So far, the manufacturing PMI seems broadly unaffected by the weakness in emerging markets, even though we have had a couple of months with falling financial sentiment indicators (Sentix and ZEW). In line with the financial sentiment we expect a decline in the manufacturing PMI, which would also be consistent with the lower order-inventory balance and the recent weak German data. The German PMIs should decrease the most as the Volkswagen exhaust scandal is likely to add to the negative sentiment, whereas the French PMIs are set to be less affected as suggested by the recent improvement in French business surveys.\u201d Good morning and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and the business world. European Central Bank president Mario Draghi\u2019s hints of more stimulus in December lifted European stock indices yesterday and pushed the euro lower. Major markets (Germany\u2019s Dax, France\u2019s CAC, Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB and Spain\u2019s Ibex) all ended the day more than 2% higher, while the FTSE finished 0.4% higher. On Wall Street, the Dow Jones closed up 1.9% while in Asia, shares were also higher, with Japan\u2019s Nikkei rising 2.1%. As Jasper, Lawler, market analyst at CMC Markets UK, writes: There were two defining moments in Mr Draghi\u2019s press conference. The most important was when he said that \u201cthe degree of monetary policy accommodation will need to be re-examined at our December monetary policy meeting.\u201d The next one was during the Q&amp;A session when he said that, unlike on previous occasions, the ECB did discuss cutting the deposit rate at the October meeting. An explicit reference to both a date and an easing measure was enough to send the euro plummeting and stocks off to the races.\u201d Today, the main focus are manufacturing surveys for October. The French and German flash services and manufacturing PMIs for October are expected to contract on Friday, Lawlers says, while the eurozone composite PMI (which includes manufacturing and services) is projected to drop from 53.6 to 53.4. Investec economist Ryan Djajasaputra has done a preview: September\u2019s composite PMI fell back to 53.6 from 54.3 in August, with falls seen across both manufacturing (52.0) and services (53.7). Despite September\u2019s edging back, activity remains comfortably in positive territory. A steady level in the PMIs over the third quarter (Q3 averaged 53.9, the same as Q2) suggests that the euro area maintained a steady pace of growth around 0.4%. Looking forward momentum looks to be maintained with the PMIs signalling further expansion in output, employment and new orders. We suspect that the composite PMI will remain relatively stable (53.4) in October, continuing the trend of a gradual euro area recovery.\u201d We will also get the Markit flash manufacturing PMI for the US.",

While ostensibly the ECB\u2019s forthcoming forecast update will determine whether we actually see new policy action in December, Draghi sent an unambiguous signal that additional easing is highly likely. Indeed, he stated that some Governing Council members had \u2018hinted\u2019 that they wanted further stimulus already. And options on the table now not only include amendments to the ECB\u2019s asset purchase programme in terms of size, composition and duration but \u2013 in a significant U-turn \u2013 a further cut in the deposit rate.</p> <p>Since the ECB expects the consumer-led economic recovery to be maintained and has been encouraged by the ongoing improvement in bank lending conditions, in the absence of a new adverse shock we had expected it to agree in December simply to extend the current asset purchase programme beyond September 2016, perhaps by one further year. But doing only that would now significantly disappoint the market. e.g. 2Y Bunds have plummeted to a new low of -35bps and the euro is down more than 2 cents to $1.11, the lowest since August, starting to reverse the 7% appreciation in the trade-weighted exchange rate seen since April.</p> <p>Certainly, any adverse news between now and December \u2013 in terms of either economic or financial conditions \u2013 would bring the other policy options, such as an increased rate of asset purchase or a cut in the deposit rate, into play. And by maintaining the rate cut as a feasible option in December and (if it is not implemented then) beyond, short-dated yields should remain super-low and downward pressure should be maintained on the exchange rate. Indeed, in that respect, yesterday\u2019s announcement might partly be interpreted as an effective means of verbal FX intervention.\u201d</p> </blockquote> <p><br>Despite Draghi\u2019s dovishness, today\u2019s economic data should maintain cause for cautious optimism about the near-term economic growth outlook. </p> <p>The French flash PMIs for October just released surprised on the upside: contrary to expectations of declines this month, the manufacturing, services and composite indices improved. </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>So, while the equivalent euro area PMIs were also expected to have eased somewhat from September\u2019s levels (with the euro area composite index forecast to fall 0.2pt to below 53.5 for first time since February), the risks appear now to be to the upside.

Major markets (Germany\u2019s Dax, France\u2019s CAC, Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB and Spain\u2019s Ibex) all ended the day more than 2% higher, while the FTSE finished 0.4% higher. </p> <p>On Wall Street, the Dow Jones closed up 1.9% while in Asia, shares were also higher, with Japan\u2019s Nikkei rising 2.1%.</p> <p>As Jasper, Lawler, market analyst at CMC Markets UK, writes:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p><strong>There were two defining moments in Mr Draghi\u2019s press conference</strong>. The most important was when he said that \u201cthe degree of monetary policy accommodation will need to be re-examined at our December monetary policy meeting.\u201d </p> <p>The next one was during the Q&amp;A session when he said that, unlike on previous occasions, the ECB did discuss cutting the deposit rate at the October meeting.

The French and German flash services and manufacturing PMIs for October are expected to contract on Friday, Lawlers says, while the eurozone composite PMI (which includes manufacturing and services) is projected to drop from 53.6 to 53.4.</p> <p>Investec economist Ryan Djajasaputra has done a preview:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>September\u2019s composite PMI fell back to 53.6 from 54.3 in August, with falls seen across both manufacturing (52.0) and services (53.7). Despite September\u2019s edging back, activity remains comfortably in positive territory.</p> <p> A steady level in the PMIs over the third quarter (Q3 averaged 53.9, the same as Q2) suggests that the euro area maintained a steady pace of growth around 0.4%. Looking forward momentum looks to be maintained with the PMIs signalling further expansion in output, employment and new orders. </p> <p>We suspect that the composite PMI will remain relatively stable (53.4) in October, continuing the trend of a gradual euro area recovery.\u201d</p> </blockquote> <p>We will also get the Markit flash manufacturing PMI for the US.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2015-10-23T07:10:21.781Z\">at 8.10am BST</time></p>  </div>",

      "bodyText": "TalkTalk says it has received a ransom demand from an individual or group claiming responsibility for a cyber-attack that has potentially compromised the credit card and bank details of millions of customers. The telecommunications and media firm has said it does not know how many of its 4 million customers have been affected by what it called a \u201csignificant and sustained\u201d attack on its systems. A TalkTalk spokeswoman said: \u201cWe can confirm we were contacted by someone claiming to be responsible and seeking payment.\u201d The spokeswoman declined to elaborate on the demand, saying \u201ceverything else is a matter for the police\u201d. TalkTalk\u2019s chief executive, Dido Harding, told the BBC on Friday: \u201cYes, we have been contacted by \u2013 I don\u2019t know whether it\u2019s an individual or a group \u2013 purporting to be the hacker. \u201cI personally received a contact from someone purporting \u2013 as I say, I don\u2019t know whether they are or are not \u2013 to be the hacker, looking for money.\u201d TalkTalk shares had tumbled by more than 10% at 4pm on Friday, as investors worried about the financial impact of the cyber-attack. Harding previously said the company had assumed a worst-case scenario that all the personal data relating to its customers was compromised until TalkTalk could confirm exactly what was taken. She apologised to customers for the third cyber-attack affecting the telecommunications firm in the past 12 months, but said the breaches were \u201ccompletely unrelated\u201d. Harding told the BBC \u201cthe awful truth is I don\u2019t know\u201d whether all the data was encrypted, adding: \u201cWith the benefit of hindsight, were we doing enough? Well, you\u2019ve got to say that we weren\u2019t and obviously we will be looking back and reviewing that extremely seriously.\u201d Harding said Wednesday\u2019s attack on TalkTalk\u2019s systems should be treated as a crime. \u201cWhether it is the US government, Apple, a host of companies, cybercrime is something we all need to get better at defending ourselves against,\u201d she said. The Metropolitan police cybercrime unit has launched an investigation into the breach amid speculation that the attackers could be Islamic extremists or extortionists. Adrian Culley, a former detective at the unit, said the hack appeared to be the work of Islamic militants after a group claimed responsibility for the attack in the name of Allah. He told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme: \u201cIt appears at face value to be Islamic cyberterrorism.\u201d The claim could not be verified, but Culley pointed out that a group calling itself \u201cTalkTalk Hackers\u201d published what it claimed was a sample of dozens of email addresses and national security numbers as proof of the attack. The group posted the message on the site Pastebin, which is often used by hackers for publishing large amounts of information. The message used the rhetoric of Islamist militants to justify the hack. It said: \u201cWe will teach our children to use the web for Allah \u2026 your hands will be covered in blood \u2026 judgment day is soon.\u201d Culley said the attack was a matter of national security. \u201cBy the very nature of who TalkTalk are, they are [a] communications service provider, they are also part of the UK\u2019s critical national infrastructure, so this is a concern not just for the police but the security services,\u201d he said. Prof Peter Sommer, from De Montfort University\u2019s cybersecurity unit, told the Today programme: \u201cIt seems to me the suggestion that these are Islamic terrorists who are perpetrating it is unlikely, not impossible. \u201cOne has to look at what is probably the most likely outcome. One of them is an extortion attempt; since they have gone public I suspect that\u2019s not going to work. The other one is just to get hold of the credit card information, get hold of the personal information.\u201d Scotland Yard confirmed it was investigating the breach but said there have been no arrests. In a statement, it added: \u201cWe are aware of speculation regarding alleged perpetrators. This investigation remains at an early stage. A full assessment of the alleged data theft is ongoing.\u201d TalkTalk said it was continuing to work with leading cybercrime specialists and the Met to establish exactly what happened and the extent of any information accessed. \u201cUnfortunately there is a chance that some of the following data has been compromised: names, addresses, date of birth, phone numbers, email addresses, TalkTalk account information, credit card details and/or bank details.\u201d The firm admitted in its website FAQs section that some of the data was not encrypted but said it believed its systems were as secure as they could be. In a letter to customers, TalkTalk\u2019s managing director, Tristia Harrison, said the company took \u201cany threat to the security of our customers\u2019 data very seriously\u201d. She said the company had contacted major banks, which will monitor any suspicious activity from customers\u2019 accounts, as well as the Information Commissioner\u2019s Office. But the information commissioner, Christopher Graham, said TalkTalk should have notified the personal data watchdog sooner about the attacks. He told BBC Radio 4\u2019s World at One: \u201cI wish we had heard a little bit earlier and we could have been more \u2018out there\u2019 giving advice to consumers about what they need to protect their personal information.\u201d The ICO is already investigating TalkTalk over two previous data breaches, Graham added \u2013 one in December 2014 and one in August. \u201cThe job of the Metropolitan police in this case is to investigate the theft, the job of the Information Commissioner\u2019s Office is to investigate why the thieves were able to get away with it,\u201d he said. The ICO can impose monetary penalties for data breaches, capped at \u00a3500,000, as well as enforcement notices. Graham indicated that if the information on TalkTalk\u2019s systems was not secure it could lead to a bigger penalty from the watchdog. \u201cThere isn\u2019t an off-the-peg solution that renders everything secure and in some cases encrypting everything would probably be excessive,\u201d he said. \u201cBut the big civil monetary penalty we imposed on the Sony Corporation for the PlayStation incident was involving the lack of encryption of customer data \u2013 and that cost them \u00a3200,000. People have got to take this seriously.\u201d",

    "webTitle": "Steel industry crisis: unions dismiss \u00a39m support plan as woeful", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Trade unions have dismissed the government\u2019s announcement of up to \u00a39m to support steelworkers and local businesses in Scunthorpe as woefully inadequate after Tata Steel\u2019s decision to cut 900 workers\u2019 jobs in the north Lincolnshire town. Tata\u2019s regeneration arm, UK Steel Enterprise has pledged \u00a33m to support job creation in Scunthorpe after it decided this week to mothball the company\u2019s plate mill. The government said it would match Tata\u2019s contribution to help new businesses and companies looking to expand in the area. Taxpayers will also provide up to \u00a33m for training workers affected by the closure at local further education colleges. Sajid Javid, the business secretary, said: \u201cThe government has no intention of simply standing aside while the steel industry faces global challenges on a scale unprecedented in recent years. We will do everything we can to help workers and to ensure a level playing field for the industry.\u201d But Tony Burke, assistant general secretary of the Unite union, said: \u201cThis is a woefully inadequate response from the government to support a town and industry which is being rocked by job losses. \u201cScunthorpe and the surrounding area are reliant on skilled steel jobs. Once the jobs are gone the knock-on impact will be felt throughout the supply chain and the local economy. The government funding announced by business secretary Sajid Javid is a drop in the ocean to what is needed.\u201d Javid faced criticism in the House of Commons on Tuesday over the government\u2019s response to the British steel crisis after Tata announced 1,200 job cuts in Scunthorpe and Scotland. Labour MPs said promises to retrain workers were inadequate and that the industry could disappear without government intervention. The government has also admitted that \u00a380m of measures to help workers who had lost their jobs at SSI\u2019s Redcar plant included redundancy payments. The general secretary of Community, the steelworkers\u2019 union, said the government should be trying to stop the job losses. Roy Rickhuss said: \u201cThe government needs to get round the table with Tata Steel and the wider industry and implement the measures required to sustain steel making and retain skills and jobs in this vital foundation industry. \u201cWorried steelworkers will not be reassured by today\u2019s announcement, especially given the UK government\u2019s track record over the support package for SSI workers, where even now it is unclear what is new money and how it will be spent.\u201d Britain\u2019s steel industry has been battered by falling prices, high energy costs, cheap imports and the strength of the pound, which has made exports expensive. Tata said imports of steel plate into Europe had doubled in the past two years and imports from China had quadrupled. The government\u2019s critics have accused ministers of failing to confront the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, during his state visit to Britain over China\u2019s alleged dumping of cheap steel in Europe. Javid\u2019s department said it had asked Baroness Liz Redfern, the Conservative leader of North Lincolnshire council, to lead a taskforce to identify where spending was needed and to work with UK Steel Enterprise. UK Steel Enterprise is also providing \u00a31.5m to support steel communities around its Dalzell and Clydebridge sites in Scotland. The government said it was in talks with the Scottish government about extra support.",

      "bodyText": "TalkTalk has said it does not know how many of its 4 million customers have been affected by a \u201csignificant and sustained\u201d cyber-attack which could have compromised credit card and bank details. Dido Harding, the chief executive, apologised to customers for the third cyber-attack affecting the telecommunications firm in the past 12 months but said the breaches were \u201ccompletely unrelated\u201d. Harding told ITV\u2019s Good Morning Britain that TalkTalk moved as fast as possible after being alerted to the hack. \u201cOn Wednesday lunchtime, all we knew was that our website was running slowly and that we had the indications of a hacker trying to attack us,\u201d she said. \u201cI can\u2019t even tell you today exactly how many customers have been affected. We have tried to come public as fast as we can once we have got a reasonable idea of what potential data has been lost. \u201cI really appreciate the frustration and the worry and the concern that this causes customers \u2013 I am a customer myself \u2013 and I am very sorry for that. We are rushing to try and get that information to our customers as fast as we possibly can.\u201d TalkTalk admitted in its website FAQs section that some of the data was not encrypted but said it believed the firm\u2019s systems were as secure as they could be. Harding said Wednesday\u2019s attack on TalkTalk\u2019s systems should be treated as a crime. \u201cWhether it is the US government, Apple, a host of companies, cybercrime is something we all need to get better at defending ourselves against,\u201d she said. The Metropolitan police cybercrime unit has launched an investigation into the breach amid speculation that the attackers could be Islamic extremists or extortionists. Adrian Culley, a former detective at Scotland Yard\u2019s cybercrime unit, said the hack appeared to be the work of Islamic militants after a group claimed responsibility for the attack in the name of Allah. He told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme: \u201cIt appears at face value to be Islamic cyberterrorism.\u201d The claim could not be verified, but Culley pointed out that a group calling themselves \u201cTalkTalk Hackers\u201d published what they claimed were a sample of dozens of email addresses and national security numbers as proof of the attack. They posted the message on the site Pastebin, which is often used by hackers for publishing large amounts of information. The message used the rhetoric of Islamic militants to justify the hack. It said: \u201cWe will teach our children to use the web for Allah \u2026 your hands will be covered in blood \u2026 judgement day is soon.\u201d Culley said the attack was a matter of national security. He said: \u201cBy the very nature of who TalkTalk are, they are [a] communications service provider, they are also part of the UK\u2019s critical national infrastructure, so this is a concern not just for the police but the security services.\u201d Scotland Yard said: \u201cThere have been no arrests and inquiries are ongoing. We are aware of speculation regarding alleged perpetrators. This investigation remains at an early stage. A full assessment of the alleged data theft is ongoing.\u201d TalkTalk said: \u201cThat investigation is ongoing, but unfortunately there is a chance that some of the following data has been compromised: names, addresses, date of birth, phone numbers, email addresses, TalkTalk account information, credit card details and/or bank details. \u201cWe are continuing to work with leading cybercrime specialists and the Metropolitan police to establish exactly what happened and the extent of any information accessed.\u201d TalkTalk shares tumbled more than 10%, wiping almost \u00a3300m from its stock market value, as investors worried about the financial impact of the cyber-attack. One security expert said the breach could destroy trust in the phone and broadband provider. Jason du Preez, the chief executive of the data privacy company Privitar, said: \u201cThese hacks are not just embarrassing to the organisations involved. They can have really serious financial and personal consequences for your users, destroying consumer trust and loyalty.\u201d TalkTalk\u2019s approach was criticised by cybersecurity expert Peter Sommer, a visiting professor at De Montfort University\u2019s cybersecurity unit, who told Today: \u201cGood practice says you ought to encrypt your data. The problem for these companies is staging their investment. They are constantly acquiring new customers, they are providing new services, the customers themselves want more facilities. \u201cYou can quite see a situation in which, for straightforward commercial reasons a company decides to delay a little bit putting in an upgrade, it then has difficulties with the upgrade, it doesn\u2019t think about the changed security environment, hackers are using new techniques all the time, and that\u2019s the decision they have to make. It looks as though they have made some rather unfortunate decisions.\u201d Sommer said it was \u201cnot impossible\u201d Islamic cyberterrorists were behind the attack, but it was more likely to be an attempt to extort money from TalkTalk or gain access to customers\u2019 personal information. \u201cIt seems to me the suggestion that these are Islamic terrorists who are perpetrating it is unlikely, not impossible,\u201d he said. \u201cOne has to look at what is probably the most likely outcome. One of them is an extortion attempt, since they have gone public I suspect that\u2019s not going to work. The other one is just to get hold of the credit card information, get hold of the personal information.\u201d Customers criticised TalkTalk over the announcement on Twitter. Katie Jonas said she had been on hold to TalkTalk customer services for more than an hour. \u201cI\u2019m very concerned that my bank details may have been taken but didn\u2019t want to have to change all bank details. It\u2019s a lot of hassle doing so but now it looks like I will have to after the disgusting customer service,\u201d she said. \u201cI was angry enough being on hold that long but to then be cut off is terrible.\u201d In a letter to customers, TalkTalk\u2019s managing director, Tristia Harrison, said the company took \u201cany threat to the security of our customers\u2019 data very seriously\u201d. The company said it had contacted major banks, which will monitor any suspicious activity from customers\u2019 accounts, as well as the Information Commissioner\u2019s Office. It is also organising free credit monitoring for a year for all customers. Any customers who notice unusual activity on their accounts have been advised to contact their bank and Action Fraud, the UK\u2019s national fraud and internet crime reporting centre. They have also been urged to change their TalkTalk account passwords and any other accounts that use the same passwords.",

We are rushing to try and get that information to our customers as fast as we possibly can.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/oct/23/talktalk-breach-what-to-do-if-youre-a-customer\">TalkTalk breach: what to do if you're a customer</a> </p> </aside>  <p>TalkTalk admitted in its website FAQs section that some of the data was not encrypted but said it believed the firm\u2019s systems were as secure as they could be. <br></p> <p>Harding said Wednesday\u2019s attack on TalkTalk\u2019s systems should be treated as a crime. \u201cWhether it is the US government, Apple, a host of companies, cybercrime is something we all need to get better at defending ourselves against,\u201d she said.</p> <p>The Metropolitan police cybercrime unit has launched an investigation into the breach amid speculation that the attackers could be Islamic extremists or extortionists.</p> <p>Adrian Culley, a former detective at Scotland Yard\u2019s cybercrime unit, said the hack appeared to be the work of Islamic militants after a group claimed responsibility for the attack in the name of Allah.</p> <p>He told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme: \u201cIt appears at face value to be Islamic cyberterrorism.\u201d</p> <p>The claim could not be verified, but Culley pointed out that a group calling themselves \u201cTalkTalk Hackers\u201d published what they claimed were a sample of dozens of email addresses and national security numbers as proof of the attack.</p> <p>They posted the message on the site Pastebin, which is often used by hackers for publishing large amounts of information. The message used the rhetoric of Islamic militants to justify the hack. It said: \u201cWe will teach our children to use the web for Allah \u2026 your hands will be covered in blood \u2026 judgement day is soon.\u201d</p> <p>Culley said the attack was a matter of national security. He said: \u201cBy the very nature of who TalkTalk are, they are [a] communications service provider, they are also part of the UK\u2019s critical national infrastructure, so this is a concern not just for the police but the security services.\u201d</p> <p>Scotland Yard said: \u201cThere have been no arrests and inquiries are ongoing. We are aware of speculation regarding alleged perpetrators. This investigation remains at an early stage. A full assessment of the alleged data theft is ongoing.\u201d</p> <p>TalkTalk said: \u201cThat investigation is ongoing, but unfortunately there is a chance that some of the following data has been compromised: names, addresses, date of birth, phone numbers, email addresses, TalkTalk account information, credit card details and/or bank details.</p> <p>\u201cWe are continuing to work with leading cybercrime specialists and the Metropolitan police to establish exactly what happened and the extent of any information accessed.\u201d</p> <p>TalkTalk shares tumbled more than 10%, wiping almost \u00a3300m from its stock market value, as investors worried about the financial impact of the cyber-attack.</p> <p> One security expert said the breach could destroy trust in the phone and broadband provider. Jason du Preez, the chief executive of the data privacy company Privitar, said: \u201cThese hacks are not just embarrassing to the organisations involved. They can have really serious financial and personal consequences for your users, destroying consumer trust and loyalty.\u201d</p> <p>TalkTalk\u2019s approach was criticised by cybersecurity expert Peter Sommer, a visiting professor at De Montfort University\u2019s cybersecurity unit, who told Today: \u201cGood practice says you ought to encrypt your data. The problem for these companies is staging their investment. They are constantly acquiring new customers, they are providing new services, the customers themselves want more facilities.</p> <p>\u201cYou can quite see a situation in which, for straightforward commercial reasons a company decides to delay a little bit putting in an upgrade, it then has difficulties with the upgrade, it doesn\u2019t think about the changed security environment, hackers are using new techniques all the time, and that\u2019s the decision they have to make. It looks as though they have made some rather unfortunate decisions.\u201d <br><br>Sommer said it was \u201cnot impossible\u201d Islamic cyberterrorists were behind the attack, but it was more likely to be an attempt to extort money from TalkTalk or gain access to customers\u2019 personal information. <br></p> <p>\u201cIt seems to me the suggestion that these are Islamic terrorists who are perpetrating it is unlikely, not impossible,\u201d he said. \u201cOne has to look at what is probably the most likely outcome. One of them is an extortion attempt, since they have gone public I suspect that\u2019s not going to work. The other one is just to get hold of the credit card information, get hold of the personal information.\u201d <br></p> <p>Customers criticised TalkTalk over the announcement on Twitter. Katie Jonas said she had been on hold to TalkTalk customer services for more than an hour. \u201cI\u2019m very concerned that my bank details may have been taken but didn\u2019t want to have to change all bank details. It\u2019s a lot of hassle doing so but now it looks like I will have to after the disgusting customer service,\u201d she said.</p> <p> \u201cI was angry enough being on hold that long but to then be cut off is terrible.\u201d</p> <p> </p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Arthur Stafford tweet about TalkTalk\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Anyone on &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/TalkTalk_UK&quot;&gt;@TalkTalk_UK&lt;/a&gt; Several attempts have just been made to hack my Mac under the guise of &amp;#39;Apple Virus Search&amp;#39; Watch out, clear history!&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; arthur stafford (@arthurliverpool) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/arthurliverpool/status/657309820110917632&quot;&gt;October 22, 2015&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;script async src=&quot;//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <p><a href=\"http://help2.talktalk.co.uk/oct22incident\">In a letter to customers</a>, TalkTalk\u2019s managing director, Tristia Harrison, said the company took \u201cany threat to the security of our customers\u2019 data very seriously\u201d.<br></p> <p>The company said it had contacted major banks, which will monitor any suspicious activity from customers\u2019 accounts, as well as the Information Commissioner\u2019s Office.
