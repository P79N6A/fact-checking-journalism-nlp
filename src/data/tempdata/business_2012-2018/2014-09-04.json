In its Govia joint venture with SNCF subsidiary Keolis, Go-Ahead is set to start operating the Thameslink, Southern and Great Northern commuter franchise from 14 September, the annual revenues from which will top \u00a31bn. Brown said: \"We will be the largest train operator in the UK once we take over.\" But he said current profit margins were only 1% in the rail business, due to the lifespan of the contracts with the government. Govia is also shortlisted for the Northern and TransPennine Express rail franchises. He added that Go-Ahead \"continued to make a positive contribution to society through the services we run, careful environmental stewardship and the taxes we pay.\" The company was the first in the FTSE 350 to be awarded the Fair Tax Mark, in a scheme aiming to hold firms to account. Brown stressed he hoped to be \"the first, not the only\". The group paid \u00a312.4m in corporation tax, on profits before tax of \u00a391.2m, up 44% from 2013. The firm could also claimed innovation in smart ticketing and fuel saving, Brown said. Its Key smartcard now enables bus customers to book other services throughout the country \u2013 for example Brighton bus passengers can travel on Southern trains to London and use public transport on the same card. Meanwhile the flywheel Formula One technology that stores energy through braking is due to be fitted to 500 of its buses, reducing fuel consumption and emissions.",

Corporate governance group ISS had recommended investors vote against Betfair's boardroom pay deals, arguing the performance requirement for one long-term, share-based bonus had been made easier \"contrary to standard market practice\". Some 24m shares, 32% of votes cast, were against Betfair's remuneration report, with a further 2.2m abstention votes underlining the unpopularity of the group's executive pay deals. Last year, only 4.6% or shareholders voted against the pay report. A spokesman for Betfair said: \"The board understands that it is the policy of certain shareholders to oppose any amendments to targets and discussions with those shareholders voting against this resolution highlighted the change to the 2011 [long-term award] as the cause of opposition. The current management does not participate in this scheme and the remuneration of current management was not raised in any of these shareholder discussions.\" Before the meeting, however, there had also been separate criticsm from another corporate governance group Pirc, which had taken issue with pay arrangements for chief executive Breon Corcoran, suggesting he could be entitled to a bonus of up to 380% of his salary. It described performance benchmarks as \"not adequate\" and suggested share rewards were released too quickly. Corcoran's pay package was worth \u00a31.28m for 2014, according to the annual report, down from \u00a33.7m the previous year, when he joined the business. His 2013 remuneration was boosted by a \"golden hello\" of restricted share awards and payments to cover his relocation from Ireland. A Pirc report, issued earlier this week, told investors: \"Awarded [Betfair] CEO pay is not considered in line with the company's financial performance over the last five years.\" Pirc had recommended a binding vote against Betfair's boardroom pay policy, but investors instead chose to target the resolution on the company's remuneration report \u2013 a milder protest as the result is not binding on the board. There was only a small ripple of protest from shareholders in relation to Betfair's annual report, with 6% of votes case either against or in abstention to the resolution. A usually uncontentious matter, this vote to receive the financial statements of directors and auditors KPMG attracted controversy after Betfair was forced to concede in its 2014 annual report that it had technically breached certain rules relating to dividends and share buybacks in past years. \u2022 This article was amended on 8 September 2014 to clarify the results of the vote on boardroom pay and add a response from Betfair.",

The TLTROs will therefore be conducted at 0.15%. This time the ECB reached the lower bound as Draghi promised there would be no more rate cuts. </li> <li>The other announcements (an ABS and Covered Bonds purchases programme, with operational details coming in October) and changes to the official statement and staff forecasts were broadly in line with our expectations. Crucially, Draghi explicitly hinted at an increase in the ECB\u2019s balance sheet of roughly \u20ac1,000bn to bring it back to the 2012 highs (\u20ac3,100bn). The idea would be to get there using both net liquidity injections from TLTROs and outright asset purchases (circa \u20ac500bn each), although it could take longer than expected. </li> <li>We see the latest easing measures as very positive for the medium- term macro outlook, hence we continue to rule out sovereign QE.

The de-anchoring of inflation expectations obviously gravely unsettled the central banker and with it came Draghi\u2019s ay caramba moment, a realisation that growth is actually needed to generate inflation. In his late August speech, Draghi set out his new pro-growth doctrine and while he maintains his iron-cast belief that structural reforms must be taken to shake-up Europe\u2019s rigid and over-encumbered economies, he recognised that fiscal and monetary policy equally have their part to play. </p> <p>At today\u2019s press conference, Draghi put his thesis into action, announcing an across the board cut to interest rates and an Asset-Backed Securities programme to give demand a much needed push.\u201d</p> <p>The 10 basis points that were shaved off all headline rates were purely symbolic. The cut highlights the point that the ECB is in an easing cycle, while the rest of the developed economies ready themselves for higher rates. The cut did its job, sending the euro sharply lower and thus instantly addressing a source of the Eurozone\u2019s deflationary pressure.\u201d</p> <p>Draghi\u2019s announcement of new asset-backed securities purchase programmes, aiming to finally get credit to the Eurozone starved corporates, meant he has recognised that the Eurozone\u2019s zombie banking sector is failing to support economic growth. In effect, the ECB is now going over the banking sector\u2019s heads. While no face value of purchases was given, this factor is almost immaterial. The fact that the world\u2019s second biggest central bank is now actively investing in this market will drive global investors into these assets and the ECB\u2019s seal of approval is worth more than any target amount of purchases.\u201d</p> <p>ECB QE is the last remaining tool in the bank\u2019s arsenal and Draghi admitted that some members wanted to do more than today\u2019s measures. After surviving a sovereign debt crisis and a severe recession, Draghi does not want to cave in to doing QE now and it will remain locked in the bank\u2019s emergency kit while their other measures attempt to resuscitate Eurozone inflation. In effect, these measures may be more effective than buying government debt ever would be and thus the QE kit will continue to gather dust.\u201d<br></p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2014-09-04T16:39:35.384Z\">at 5.39pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-540892c4e4b00ef2b327f73b\" class=\"block is-summary\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2014-09-04T16:32:01.646Z\">5.32pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Euro hits new 14-month low</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>The euro has continued to lose value against the US dollar as traders take stock of the ECB\u2019s decisions.</strong></p> <p>It\u2019s now down more than two cents, or 1.6%, at $1.2935.

The measures are effectively QE-lite and Draghi\u2019s left the door open for more measures in the future. His promise that today\u2019s cut in the deposit rates is the last is rather undermined by the fact that he made this same promise after the last cut, but he has to say this to encourage banks to take up his long term refinancing programme.

      "bodyText": "OK, that\u2019s all for today. We\u2019ll have an updated news story on today\u2019s developments online shortly. The post-press conference summary (at 3.12 pm) explains the main measures announced by the European Central Bank; interest rate cuts to fresh record lows, and a new programme to stimulate the eurozone economy by buying bundles of debt (including loans to firms, and home mortgages). The International Monetary Fund has backed the plan, with Christine Lagarde saying: \u201cWe strongly welcome the measures taken by the ECB, which will help to counteract the dangers posed by an extended period of low inflation.\u201d Perhaps a touch of \u2018I told you so\u2019, given the IMF has repeatedly called for more action from the ECB? European stock markets have hit their highest levels since January 2008, as investors welcome the latest easing of monetary policy. And the euro has weakened dramatically against the US dollar, down over two cents at one stage to $1.2935. Many analysts have predicted that today\u2019s moves mean the ECB is now unlikely to launch quantitative easing soon. Brenda Kelly of IG explains: \u201cThe governing council agreed to use all unconventional measures at its disposal to hit its mandate \u2013 stable inflation at 2%. While this might suggest that a quantitative easing programme is still possible, the decline in the euro and the diverging policies of western central banks would indicate extraordinary stimulus of this nature will be kicked into the long grass for now.\u201d Rolling reaction starts here. And the Institute of Directors has echoed Mario Draghi\u2019s call for more structural reform in the euro area, saying: \u201cThe Eurozone economies face a number of significant challenges, from insufficient flexibility in their labour markets to heavy-handed regulations stifling entrepreneurialism. Long-term liberalisation is the key to putting the Eurozone back on the path to stability and growth, not short term monetary policy tools.\u201d Back tomorrow, when we get the latest US jobs data (yup, it\u2019s Non-Farm Payroll Friday). Goodnight, and thanks. GW Frederik Ducrozet of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole\u2019s analyst note on the ECB is well worth a read; it includes this handy summary of the key points: The ECB unexpectedly cut all policy rates today, bringing the Refi rate down to 0.05% and the deposit rate to -0.20%. The TLTROs will therefore be conducted at 0.15%. This time the ECB reached the lower bound as Draghi promised there would be no more rate cuts. The other announcements (an ABS and Covered Bonds purchases programme, with operational details coming in October) and changes to the official statement and staff forecasts were broadly in line with our expectations. Crucially, Draghi explicitly hinted at an increase in the ECB\u2019s balance sheet of roughly \u20ac1,000bn to bring it back to the 2012 highs (\u20ac3,100bn). The idea would be to get there using both net liquidity injections from TLTROs and outright asset purchases (circa \u20ac500bn each), although it could take longer than expected. We see the latest easing measures as very positive for the medium- term macro outlook, hence we continue to rule out sovereign QE. Still, the burden of proof will remain on upcoming macro and inflation data. Christian Schulz, senior economist at Berenberg bank, is concerned that the ECB didn\u2019t give more detail about its plans for an asset-backed securities programme. That suggest serious dissent among the governing council, he says: The ECB has stepped up to the plate, again, as the Eurozone recovery almost grinds to a halt. The confidence shock of Russia\u2019s aggression against Ukraine and reform delays in France and Italy are threatening the projected gradual rebound of inflation towards target. After easing policy significantly \u2013 and with quantifiable effect \u2013 in June, the ECB today announced more measures. But, amid apparent serious disagreements, the ECB was unable to provide details of the scale of its asset purchase programmes, and may have added modest rate cuts to underline its intent to do more to support the recovery If you\u2019re just joining us (where were you?!), I\u2019ve been mopping up reaction to today\u2019s surprising moves from the European Central Bank, from 3.33pm. Here\u2019s some more, from Eimear Daly, Head of Market Analysis at Monex Europe. She sums up today\u2019s news, and also predicts that QE is now on the back-burner for a while at least. Draghi shy to implement QE emergency kit \u201cECB\u2019s Draghi certainly wasn\u2019t bluffing at his surprise appearance at Jackson Hole. The de-anchoring of inflation expectations obviously gravely unsettled the central banker and with it came Draghi\u2019s ay caramba moment, a realisation that growth is actually needed to generate inflation. In his late August speech, Draghi set out his new pro-growth doctrine and while he maintains his iron-cast belief that structural reforms must be taken to shake-up Europe\u2019s rigid and over-encumbered economies, he recognised that fiscal and monetary policy equally have their part to play. At today\u2019s press conference, Draghi put his thesis into action, announcing an across the board cut to interest rates and an Asset-Backed Securities programme to give demand a much needed push.\u201d The 10 basis points that were shaved off all headline rates were purely symbolic. The cut highlights the point that the ECB is in an easing cycle, while the rest of the developed economies ready themselves for higher rates. The cut did its job, sending the euro sharply lower and thus instantly addressing a source of the Eurozone\u2019s deflationary pressure.\u201d Draghi\u2019s announcement of new asset-backed securities purchase programmes, aiming to finally get credit to the Eurozone starved corporates, meant he has recognised that the Eurozone\u2019s zombie banking sector is failing to support economic growth. In effect, the ECB is now going over the banking sector\u2019s heads. While no face value of purchases was given, this factor is almost immaterial. The fact that the world\u2019s second biggest central bank is now actively investing in this market will drive global investors into these assets and the ECB\u2019s seal of approval is worth more than any target amount of purchases.\u201d ECB QE is the last remaining tool in the bank\u2019s arsenal and Draghi admitted that some members wanted to do more than today\u2019s measures. After surviving a sovereign debt crisis and a severe recession, Draghi does not want to cave in to doing QE now and it will remain locked in the bank\u2019s emergency kit while their other measures attempt to resuscitate Eurozone inflation. In effect, these measures may be more effective than buying government debt ever would be and thus the QE kit will continue to gather dust.\u201d The euro has continued to lose value against the US dollar as traders take stock of the ECB\u2019s decisions. It\u2019s now down more than two cents, or 1.6%, at $1.2935. That\u2019s a new 14-month low, and I imagine Mario Draghi will be rather pleased to see it. A weaker euro will help push up inflation, and give manufacturers a boost. As this chart shows, the euro tumbled after the ECB cut interest rates at 12.45pm BST, and then continued to weaken as the asset-backed securities plan was announced. European stock markets have just closed at their highest level since the early days of the financial crisis. The FTSEurofirst 300 index, which tracks the biggest companies across the region, has risen by 1.2% today to its highest close since January 2008. That was the month before Northern Rock was nationalised, and eight months before Lehman Brothers failed. Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB surged by 2.9%, followed by Spain\u2019s IBEX (+2%) as investors hailed the interest rate cuts, and new asset-backed securities programme, announced by the ECB today (if you missed it, there\u2019s a summary here). Tony Cross, market analyst at Trustnet Direct, says: The reaction in equity markets goes to show just how worryingly tethered investors remain to loose monetary policy. The FTSE 100 was dragged back by BP, which shed almost 6% in its biggest one-day fall in four years after a US court ruled it was grossly negligent over the 2010 Gulf of Mexico disaster. Mario Draghi has received a strong vote of support from Christine Lagarde, managing director of the International Monetary Fund (IMF). In a statement, Lagarde made it clear that she backs today\u2019s decisions, saying: \u201cWe strongly welcome the measures taken by the ECB, which will help to counteract the dangers posed by an extended period of low inflation.\u201d The IMF has been pushing the ECB for month to do more to help the eurozone economy; in June, it recommended considering a broad-based asset purchase scheme. Marc Ostwald of ADM Investor Services says that the European Central Bank is clearly focusing on (the lack of) growth, rather than simply price stability. He writes: The key point is that the ECB is in effect implementing policy on the basis of the GDP and Unemployment outlook - not inflation. Some may well observe that this is not \u2018not before time\u2019, and they are still well behind the curve. In effect the ECB\u2019s implicit policy parameters are much the same as the Fed and the BoE, even if like the BoE it will attempt to frame the rationale for policy moves in terms of its inflation target. Analysts at ABN Amro reckon today\u2019s measures will have \u201cpositive effects\u201d on the eurozone economic outlook. The package will likely put some further downward pressure on the euro, which will give an impulse to economic growth and inflation. In addition, they will help to improve bank lending. The TLRTOs, and the ABS and covered bond programmes will provide banks with lower cost funding. The ABS purchase programme could also help revive that market, which will also allow banks to remove some assets from their balance sheets. Furthermore, these measures are part of a more comprehensive package of measures. The AQR and stress tests should increase the transparency of bank balance sheets and lead to re-capitalisation where necessary. Given that our central scenario is broadly in line with the ECB\u2019s, we do not expect additional measures over and above the ones announced today. That didn\u2019t take long -- the newswires have established that Bundesbank chief Jens Weidmann opposed today\u2019s ECB decisions. The Institute of Directors, which represents Britain\u2019s top bosses, wants eurozone leaders to heed Mario Draghi\u2019s call for structural reforms. Chief economist James Sproule says: What\u2019s really needed here is action by individual governments rather than abdicating responsibility for domestic woes to the ECB. \u201cThe Eurozone economies face a number of significant challenges, from insufficient flexibility in their labour markets to heavy-handed regulations stifling entrepreneurialism. Long-term liberalisation is the key to putting the Eurozone back on the path to stability and growth, not short term monetary policy tools.\u201d The ECB has finally \u201csat up and paid attention\u201d to the sluggish eurozone recovery and the rising disinflationary pressures, says Brenda Kelly of IG: She adds that QE may be off the table for a while: \u201cThe ECB has essentially manifested its commitment to its goals when it drove the overnight deposit rate deeper into negative territory, now charging banks 0.2% to leave funds with it - and cut its marginal lending facility - or emergency borrowing rate - to 0.3%. \u201cThe governing council agreed to use all unconventional measures at its disposal to hit its mandate \u2013 stable inflation at 2%. While this might suggest that a quantitative easing programme is still possible, the decline in the euro and the diverging policies of western central banks would indicate extraordinary stimulus of this nature will be kicked into the long grass for now. Back to today\u2019s European Central Bank decisions. Aberdeen Asset Management Investment Manager Luke Bartholomew comments: \u201cFor years the ECB has been very slow to react and often frustrated markets. But in the face of dire and clearly worsening economic indicators Draghi has actually gone beyond markets\u2019 expectations today. The frustration is that it has taken so long with inflation having already fallen so low, but it is certainly progress. Despite the fact that today\u2019s announcement was not unanimous, resistance to Draghi within the council is clearly receding as the European recovery wilts. \u201cPurchasing asset backed securities and covered bonds could have a significant effect but no one really knows if there\u2019s enough of these assets to buy in order to have the desired effect. The measures are effectively QE-lite and Draghi\u2019s left the door open for more measures in the future. His promise that today\u2019s cut in the deposit rates is the last is rather undermined by the fact that he made this same promise after the last cut, but he has to say this to encourage banks to take up his long term refinancing programme. Of course what he would really like is a much weaker euro, but the gentlemanly code of central banking means he can\u2019t come out and say this explicitly.\u201d Breaking away from the ECB briefly.... shares in BP have slid by almost 5% after a US court ruled that the 2010 Deepwater Horizon disaster was due to the oil giant\u2019s \u201cgross negligence and wilful misconduct\u201d. Judge Barbier has assigned two-thirds responsibility for the oil spill to BP, which operated the oil rig which caught fire and sank four years ago. Transocean, which owned the rig, was 30% to blame, with US contractor Halliburton, who handled the cementing of the rig, just 3% responsible, Barbier concluded. One of the brightest analysts on the eurozone economy and the ECB, Lorcan Roche Kelly of Agenda Research, is encouraged by the splits that opened up at the governing council today: I\u2019m going to wrap up the best reaction to today\u2019s European Central Bank news now. First up, Gary Jenkins of LNG Capital, who reckons the chances of a quantitative easing programme have diminished: Mr Draghi was aggressively dovish early on, saying that the \u2018Governing Council is unanimous in its commitment to using additional unconventional instruments..\u2019 In other words, we have QE and we are prepared to use it. But later on Mr Draghi admitted that today\u2019s decisions were not unanimous. The market may take the latter comment and decide that if Mr Draghi cannot get agreement on a very well flagged ABS program, will he be able to deliver on QE? Mario Draghi rarely disappoints, and today\u2019s press conference is another reminder that the eurozone, for all its problems, does have a top-class central banker at the helm. Full highlights start here. But for new readers, here\u2019s a quick reminder of the key points: 1) The European Central Bank has cut interest rates to fresh record lows in an attempt to stimulate inflation, and announced a new credit scheme to encourage lending and pump money into the eurozone banking sector. Mario Draghi announced that the governing council will launch an \u2018asset-backed securities\u2019 programme, buying up financial assets from banks and other investors. The ABS scheme will allow banks to sell bundles of assets, such as loans to companies and mortgages, to the ECB. Full details aren\u2019t available, but it is likely to see the ECB commit hundreds of billions of euros. It\u2019s not a full-blown quantitative easing programme, but it\u2019s another step along the road. The idea is that banks will be more willing to make loans to the real economy if they can then package the debt into new securities and sell them to the ECB. 2) Borrowing costs are at new record lows, and Draghi admitted that the ECB is now at the \u2018lower bound\u2019 of interest rates. Today\u2019s interest rate cute mean that the main refinancing rate is now just 0.05%, from 0.15%. The ECB also pushed the financial sector deeper into negative territory. It will now charge banks 0.2% to deposit cash overnight. 3) Today\u2019s decisions were not unanimous. Draghi admitted that some members of the governing council wanted to do more today, while others favoured less. There was a \u201ccomfortable majority\u201d in favour of today\u2019s decisions, he said. But that lack of unanimity hints at a full-blooded exchange of views in Frankfurt today. 4) The ECB has cut its forecasts, conceding that the economy is weaker than expected three months ago. It now expects inflation of just 0.6%, from 0.7% in June. And it also sees GDP of just 0.9%, down from 1.0% before. 5) The ECB still wants eurozone governments to reform. During his statement, Draghi pointed out bluntly that while some governments have made significant structural progress, others have not yet legislated or implemented such work. He didn\u2019t name names, but I\u2019d put Spain in the former category, and both France and Italy in the latter. Draghi said that reforms: ..now clearly need to gain momentum to achieve higher sustainable growth and employment in the euro area. Determined structural reforms in product and labour markets as well as action to improve the business environment are warranted. And he also repeated several times that there was no secret pact that the ECB would ease policy in return for action by euro governments. We must all do our own jobs, he said. 6) The financial markets have welcomed today\u2019s news. Stock markets hit their highest levels in six and a half-years. The euro has tumbled, shedding 1.5 cents against the US dollar to \u20ac1.3005 as the \u2018arsenal of measures\u2019 were digested. It\u2019s the final question of a lively, and frankly complicated press conference -- is the ECB worried that inflation expectations are \u2018decoupling\u2019? Ie, losing faith in the ECB\u2019s ability to get inflation close to 2%, from 0.3%, in the medium term. Mario Draghi winds up by insisting that the ECB does not expect full-blown deflation. There would be no value in misleading people, he insists. He concedes that forecasting errors have been made --mainly on food and energy prices, but recently on other factors, the amount of slack in the economy, and the (stubbornly high) unemployment rate. And the ECB chief points out that some of those changes are outside the central bank\u2019s role. End of press conference. Summary and reaction to follow.... Mario Draghi has repeated that there is no hidden deal between eurozone governments and the ECB. Reminder - full coverage of the ECB press conference starts here. And details of today\u2019s eurozone interest rate cuts are here. How can you say that the governing council is \u2018unanimous\u2019 in its determination to use all measures, and then be split over today\u2019s decisions? Unanimity is not a blank cheque. We are united in our resolve, but there could be differences of views when the time comes to decide what measures to undertake, Draghi replies. Are inflation expectations still anchored? Yes, but the downside risk has increased, thus today\u2019s measures. Draghi declined to say what he discussed with Italian prime minister Matteo Renzi. The discussion remains private. And he also explains that eurozone members should share fiscal responsibilities, rather than surrender them, just as they have with monetary policy. A question from the eurozone\u2019s next member, Lithuania. How will the Lithuanian inflation rate differ from the eurozone average in the months ahead? Draghi elegantly avoids giving an answer, but pays tribute to the remarkable progress achieved by Lithuania in qualifying to join the euro. Something I missed earlier, is that Draghi has flagged up the idea of expanding the ECB\u2019s balance sheet back to its 2012 levels. That balance sheet has been shrinking over the last two years, by around \u20ac1 trillion. The TLTRO loan programme could be up to \u20ac700bn, suggesting that the ABS programme agreed today will be at least \u20ac300bn (and could hit \u20ac500bn if the TLTRO total is lower). There\u2019s no grand bargain in the eurozone between politicians and central bankers, Draghi insists. We just need to all keep doing our own jobs. Draghi harks back to his speech at Jackson Hole (the gathering of top US central bankers) last month. He explains that it is crucial to keep reforming the eurozone to make it more competitive -- from a confidence point of view it would be better to have very serious discussion about structural reforms first, before asking whether euro governments should be granted more flexibility. University of Bristol economist Tony Yates reckons the ABS could actually be more powerful than a quantitative easing programme. The new ABS programme we agreed today will buy up loans made to the real economy, Draghi explains. That includes residential mortgage-backed securities (ie, home loans packed together into a new financial instrument) Today\u2019s measures will strengthen the TLTRO programme we announced in June, Draghi says. (TLTRO is the offer of cheap long-term loans to ECB banks). Banks now know that there is no point holding back from signing up to the TLTRO in case interest rates are cut in future, as they simply can\u2019t be cut again. Mario Draghi explains that the ECB acted after seeing inflation expectations worsen in August. Draghi added that there\u2019s nothing untoward about the appointment of US financial firm Blackrock to help with an asset-backed securities programme. The FT\u2019s Claire Jones seeks more information about the split at the ECB today. Draghi replies that there was a \u2018comfortable majority\u2019 in favour of launching an ABS programme. What\u2019s the difference between today\u2019s ABS programme, and a full-blown quantitative easing programme? And how big will it be? Mario Draghi declines to give a figure right now. And he gives a complicated answer explaining why this isn\u2019t QE. It all comes down to the \u2018modalities\u2019, which won\u2019t be announced until October. One factor is that the ECB has been accepting asset-backed securities as collateral for lending for a decade, so it knows what it\u2019s doing when it decides to buy them outright. And the programme will be carefully set up to ensure that it only stimulates bank lending. Was Quantitative Easing discussed at today\u2019s meeting? Yes, Draghi replies. Some were in favour of doing more, and some were in favour of less. So today\u2019s decisions strike a middle-ground, he explains. A broad asset purchase scheme was discussed, and some central bank governors wanted to do more, he emphasises. Onto questions. Were today\u2019s decisions to cut interest rates and announce an asset-backed securities programme unanimous? No, they were not, Draghi replies. At a guess, Germany\u2019s Jens Weidmann must have dissented, but been outvoted. Draghi also suggests that today\u2019s rate cuts really are the last ones. Draghi\u2019s full statement is online here. Mario Draghi is ending his statement with a warning to eurozone countries to press on with structural reforms. Some countries have made important progress, but others still need to legislate and implement measures, he says. The euro has fallen further, after Mario Draghi announced that the ECB will begin an asset-backed securities programme (basically, buying bundles of loans from the banks, in an attempt to get them to do more lending). It is hovering around $1.301, a drop of 1% or almost 1.5 cents. The ECB has also cut its inflation forecast for this year. 2014: down to 0.6%, from 0.7% in June 2015: unchanged at 1.1% 2016: unchanged at 1.4% This cut is mainly due to lower energy costs, Draghi says. The governing council will closely monitor all risks to price stability. The ECB has cut its growth forecasts for this year, and next year. It now expects eurozone growth of just 0.9% this year, down from 1%. The 2015 forecast has been cut to 1.6%, from 1.7%. The 2016 forecasts has been raised to 1.9%, from 1.8%. Draghi says several factors, including high unemployment, negative loan growth and balance sheet adjustments, will dampen the eurozone recovery. Draghi says that the governing council agreed to use all unconventional measures at its disposal, if needed, to hit its mandate. That suggests that a quantitative easing programme is still possible, but not today..... And we\u2019re off. Mario Draghi starts explains that the governing council agreed to cut its three main interest rates at today\u2019s meeting (as announced earlier). He says that the ECB governing council has also agreed to start buying non-financial assets through an asset-backed security programme. It will also include the purchase of covered bonds, as Reuters reported earlier today. We\u2019ll get the details of this plan next month, after the October meeting. The plan will add to the range of monetary policy measures taken in recent months, Draghi says. And it will support our forward guidance on interest rates. It will also address the fact that the major world economies are at different stages of the economic cycle, he adds. Mario Draghi\u2019s press conference will be streamed live here (right-click to open in a new browser tab). I\u2019ll cover the key points and instant reaction here. If you\u2019re just joining us, here\u2019s a quick catch-up, before the ECB press conference: The European Central Bank has just cut interest rates to fresh record lows, and hit banks with deeper negative interests, at its monthly meeting. In a surprise move, the ECB\u2019s governing council cut borrowing costs in the single currency area, in response to the latest weak inflation and low growth. The headline rate is now just 0.05%, from 0.15%. And banks will be charged 0.2% to leave money at the ECB rather than lending it to consumers and businesses. Analysts say the cut shows the depth of the ECB\u2019s concern about deflation, and the recent poor economic data. The news sent the euro sliding to its lowest level in over a year, down almost 1% to $1.3031. There are also rumours that the ECB considered a new \u20ac500bn programme to stimulate bank lending -- nothing official yet, but Mario Draghi could drop hints (or more) in a few minutes.... Just 15 minute until the European Central Bank holds its press conference to explain today\u2019s decisions. The big, big question is whether Mario Draghi announces new non-conventional measures in the press conference, or even hints at them.... The interest rate cuts show just how worried the ECB is about \u201cvery low and still falling Eurozone consumer price inflation, weakening inflation expectations and faltering Eurozone economic activity\u201d, says Howard Archer of IHS Global Insight. Carsten Brzeski of ING suggests Mario Draghi may, finally, be preparing to flood the eurozone with cheap cash: Was this the start of Draghi\u2019s helicopter? The ECB just announced a rate cut by 10bp, lowering the refi rate to 0.05%, from 0.15%. Both the marginal lending rate and the deposit rate were also cut by 10bp. At 2.30 pm CET, we will know whether this was the prelude to another monetary policy fireworks or just the easiest way out to prevent QE without a loss of face. European stock markets have rallied after the ECB cut interest rates. France\u2019s CAC index surged 1%, on optimism that the move could help Europe out of its malaise. The Italian FTSE MIB is up by 1.5%. Today\u2019s interest rate cut is a smart move by the European Central Bank, says our economics editor Larry Elliott. He explains that the ECB wants to drive the euro down, and has timed the rate cut very well as the US dollar is strong at present. It\u2019s also a resounding statement of intent, that the ECB is not going to sit on its hands as the eurozone slides towards deflation. Here\u2019s the full statement from the ECB, announcing its decision to cut interest rates. 4 September 2014 - Monetary policy decisions At today\u2019s meeting the Governing Council of the ECB took the following monetary policy decisions: The interest rate on the main refinancing operations of the Eurosystem will be decreased by 10 basis points to 0.05%, starting from the operation to be settled on 10 September 2014. The interest rate on the marginal lending facility will be decreased by 10 basis points to 0.30%, with effect from 10 September 2014. The interest rate on the deposit facility will be decreased by 10 basis points to -0.20%, with effect from 10 September 2014. The President of the ECB will comment on the considerations underlying these decisions at a press conference starting at 2.30 p.m. CET today.  So, no mention of new measures such as the \u20ac500bn ABS programme which was rumoured to be under consideration (new readers should click here). But Mario Draghi may be saving new measures back for his press conference in 30 minutes.... The euro has tumbled by over a cent against the US dollar to a new one-year low, as traders react to the unexpected cut in interest rates. It has hit \u20ac1.3048, a fall of 0.8%, to the lowest rate in over a year. Breaking: The European Central Bank has cut interest rates across the eurozone. Weak growth and falling inflation has prompted the ECB to ease policy again, at today\u2019s meeting in Brussels. The headline interest rate has been slashed to just 0.05%, from 0.15% before. And banks are being hit with more costly negative interest rates -- they\u2019ll be charged 0.2% to leave cash at the ECB. The news that the ECB is considering a \u20ac500bn programme to buy up asset-backed securities and covered bonds (see here) has pushed the euro down a little (-0.15% at $1.3132). The potential size of the three-year programme has surprised some economists, who point out that the total ABS market isn\u2019t much larger, even if you include packages of home loans (residential mortgage-backed securities). However, such a plan would be designed to stimulate the currently-moribund ABS market, not simply mop up what\u2019s available today. Turn to flows-vs-stocks in your economics textbooks.... Traders, analysts and economists across the City, and beyond, are scrambling for lunch before the European Central Bank announces its decision on monetary policy in around 15 minutes. So here\u2019s a quick recap. The ECB\u2019s governing council is reported to be considering a \u20ac500bn programme to encourage eurozone banks to make new loans, securitise them, and sell them on. Details could come at 1.30pm BST in Mario Draghi\u2019s press conference. Most economists expect the ECB will resist a full-blown quantitative easing programme today... although it could come early next year. Eurogroup president Jeroen Dijsselbloem has warned that the eurozone recovery remains very fragile and uneven. Dijsselbloem also told MEPs that he believes the region will avoid deflation, and that governments must implement structural reforms. The Bank of England has left interest rates unchanged. The UK interest rate decision has been welcomed by the British Chambers of Commerce, who are worried that the Bank of England will start hiking too soon. BCC chief economist David Kern said: The UK recovery is on track but there are still challenges up ahead. The eurozone, our largest export market, is stagnant and official figures show that manufacturing activity is at its lowest level since June last year. We must act with caution and ensure the recovery is not put at risk with unnecessary interest rate increases.\u201d The looming Scottish independence vote probably encouraged the Bank of England to sit tight at this week\u2019s meeting. Howard Archer of IHS Global Insight says: Most MPC members would have been wary of raising interest rates just before the Scottish independence vote due to the potential near-term negative impact that a yes vote could have on the UK economy through increasing uncertainty. Indeed, if the Scots do vote for independence, it could well markedly delay any interest rate hike. Any excuse to mention Clement Attlee: To no-one\u2019s surprise, the Bank of England has left UK interest rates unchanged at 0.5%, and also maintained its QE programme at \u00a3375bn. We now have to wait two weeks for the minutes of today\u2019s meeting, to find how many MPC members wanted a rate rise (it split 7-2 last month). Reuters has just reported that the European Central Bank\u2019s governing council is considering throwing up to \u20ac500bn behind an asset-backed securities programme. It could be announced today, unless there is opposition from members of the council. The ECB has declined to comment. Here\u2019s Reuters\u2019 first take: Plans to launch an asset-backed securities (ABS) and covered bond purchase programme worth up to 500 billion euros are on the table at Thursday\u2019s European Central Bank policy meeting, people familiar with the discussions say. ECB President Mario Draghi will likely announce such a programme at his news conference unless it comes up against strong opposition at the Governing Council\u2019s policy meeting. The programme would have a duration of three years and comprise both ABS and covered bond purchases. The ECB could begin buying the assets this year, the people familiar with the discussions told Reuters.The ECB declined to comment. It\u2019s not a shock that the ECB is considering an ABS programme, of course. But the size of the programme is new. And if it doesn\u2019t happen now, we\u2019ll know that there are divisions over the plan. Also, it\u2019s pretty rare to get a central bank leak during the meeting... In the UK, car sales have risen for the 30th month running, a record, as consumers continue to splash out on new models. A sign that consumer confidence remains solid, and is underpinning the recovery (there\u2019 s also speculation that PPI mis-selling payouts has been pushing demand) More here: UK drivers splash out on new cars as record run of sales continues Very droll, sir.... For new readers, ABS = asset backed securities. Mario Draghi may pre-announce details of an ABS programme to encourage banks to package together, or securitise, loans into a new debt instrument to sell to the ECB. Securitisation, of course, was one cause of the 2008 financial crisis, after banks bundling some pretty dubious home loans together and selling them on. Jeroen Dijsselbloem went on to tell MEPs that he doesn\u2019t believe the eurozone will slip into deflation, despite the CPI measure of inflation hitting a five-year low of just 0.3%. He said: \u201cI don\u2019t actually see deflationary risks , but I see a risk of a long term of a very low inflation which has to be broken through.\u201d The eurozone recovery is very uneven and fragile, but the European Central Bank should resist launching new measures today. That\u2019s the message from the head of the eurogroup of eurozone finance ministers, Jeroen Dijsselbloem. Testifying in Brussels this morning, Dijsselbloem said that governments must implement structural reforms, rather than simply rely on easy monetary policy. He also argued that the European Central Bank shouldn\u2019t launch a quantitative easing programme now, as we don\u2019t know whether its existing measures will work. Dijsselbloem, who is also the Dutch finance minister, told the European Parliament\u2019s economic and monetary committee that: Recent economic data confirm that the recovery in the euro zone remains very fragile and uneven. I believe that recent developments underscore the need to push forwards the growth and reform agenda. Fundamental challenges faced by the euro zone are unchanged, Dijsselbloem\u2019s appearance comes as the ECB governing council ponders whether to make new measures to help the eurozone (see opening post). The eurogroup head reckons we won\u2019t know until early 2015 whether ECB measures announced three months ago - such as the TLTRO offer of cheap loans to banks - are working. He says: \u201cThe June package has not been given enough consideration in our analysis and the results of that June package through the TLTRO has yet to actually take place,\u201d . \u201cWhether the ECB needs to do more will be up to their [the ECB\u2019s] judgment in the next few months, but I think we also have to realize in June a number of additional measures were taken by the ECB and their effect doesn\u2019t materialize within a day or a week. It takes time.\u201d And this handy chart shows how the ECB\u2019s June inflation forecasts failed to predict the recent slide in annual price growth, to just 0.3% last month. Spanish borrowing costs have hit new all-time lows at a debt auction this morning, as anticipation of an ECB QE programme drives demand for sovereign debt. Spain had no trouble raising \u20ac3bn, with investors accepting lower rates of return than ever before. It sold \u20ac2.3bn of 10-year bonds at average yields of just 2.27%, down from 2.68% last time. And the yield on \u20ac700m of 30-year bonds fell to 3.59%, from 4.03%. That highlights the low inflation expectations for the euro area, as well as the prospect of the ECB easing policy further... As well as celebrating his promotion, Richard Pennycook can also be cheered that Co-op is back in the black. It made a pre-tax profit of \u00a319m, not immense, but a damn sight better than the \u00a3843m loss a year ago after its banking problems came to light. The supermarkets and funerals business generated most of the profits: The Co-op has also reported that underlying profits have slumped by 43% in the first half of the year, to just \u00a366m, as the crisis at its Bank arm rocked the group. Just in. Britain\u2019s Co-operative Group has just announced that it has appointed a new CEO to steer the organisation out of its current troubles. They\u2019ve named Richard Pennycook, who\u2019s actually been working as interim CEO since March. He joined the Group as finance director in July 2013, so he\u2019s not a complete break from the past. Ursula Lidbetter, Chair, insists he\u2019s the right man - just days after members agreed a major shake-up of how the Co-op runs. Lidbetter said: \u201cThe Co-operative Group needs strong, talented, committed leadership as it starts on the next phase of its recovery and I am delighted that Richard has accepted the role of Group Chief Executive. Last week we secured the overwhelming approval of our members for far-reaching governance reform. We are now moving forward with the work to bring to life the new structure. Pennycook warns that \u201cwe have much to do to return the Group to full financial health and improve the performance of our businesses,\u201d but adds that Co-op still has a \u201cbright and exciting\u201d time ahead. He was made interim CEO in March after Euan Sutherland dramatically quit, saying the group was ungovernable... It could be disastrous if the European Central Bank launched a quantitative easing programme, says Michael Heise, chief economist of German insurance group Allianz. Writing in the FT, Heise warns that QE would expose taxpapers to risks*, and wouldn\u2019t encourage borrowing as many households are already heavily indebted. More cheap money would also deter banks from fixing their balance sheets, he argues. * - which looks unlikely, given the recovery in sovereign bond prices over the last two years Heise also points out that the weak inflation is partly due to lower energy prices - QE won\u2019t solve that. Here\u2019s his conclusion: Monetary policy alone cannot and will not return the eurozone to sustainable growth, as Mario Draghi, the ECB president, pointed out at the Jackson Hole gathering of central bankers last month. Improvements in labour markets and the investment climate, sustainable fiscal reforms and a shift of public spending towards growth-boosting investments in infrastructure and education are what Europe must focus on now. Quantitative easing would sow the seeds of crisis not recovery Aurelija Augulyte of Nordea Markets flags up that market expectations for inflation have risen a little since Mario Draghi pledged to use \u201call available\u201d powers to ward off deflation. This graph shows that investors still expect eurozone prices to lag those in the US and UK, but aren\u2019t quite as worried about deflation. This is the key measure which the ECB will use when assessing whether to do QE. More in her blog: Draghi\u2019s breakfast In the City, shares in Standard Life have soared by over 10% after it surprised the City by agreeing to sell its 180-year-old Canadian business for \u00a32.2bn in cash. Most of the money (\u00a31.75bn) will be handed back to shareholders, and the clamour has driven Standard Life\u2019s shares to the top of the FTSE 100 leaderboard, up by 39p to 425p. Otherwise, as predicted, it\u2019s quiet. The FTSE 100 is up 6 points at 6880. Analysts at UBS also reckon Mario Draghi will leave quantitative easing in his toolbox today Mario Draghi may drop hints about a potential QE programme in future today, reckons Credit Agricole\u2019s ECB expert, Frederik Ducrozet. He predicts that the ECB could trim the cost of taking part in its new offer of cheap long-term loans to eurozone banks (called TLTRO), and also pre-announce a plan to buy securitised debs from the banks. He also reckons the ECB may stick to its forecast that inflation moves back towards target by 2016, even if it is forced to downgrade its 2014 and 2015 forecasts Here\u2019s a surprise. German factory orders have jumped to their highest level in over a year, suggesting Europe\u2019s largest economy may be recovering from its weakness earlier this year. Industrial orders bounced by 4.6% in July, compared to June, smashing expectations of a 1.5% rise. It was driven by strong demand from outside the euro area, particularly for capital goods (heavy machinery). Some highlights: Domestic orders: +1.7% month-on-month Foreign orders: +6.9%. eurozone orders - +1.7% non-eurozone: +9.8% Germany\u2019s finance ministry is upbeat, saying: After the uncertainty caused by geopolitical developments and a weaker economy in the second quarter, the strong rise in orders is an encouraging signal for the industrial economy.\u201d We need to be cautious; orders over the May-July period are still lower than in the previous three months. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the financial markets, the economy, the eurozone and business. With growth stalling, prices heading towards deflation, and geopolitical risks on the rise, this is a tricky time to be a central banker. And today, Mario Draghi and the rest of the European Central Bank\u2019s governing council must decide whether to take fresh action to aid the eurozone. They\u2019re meeting in Frankfurt this morning to set monetary policy across the region. We get their decision at 12.45pm BST, followed by the big event of the day (if not the week), Draghi\u2019s press conference at 1.30pm BST. It\u2019s the first ECB meeting since Draghi dramatically pledged to use \u201call available instruments needed to ensure price stability\u201d. The latest slump in inflation, to just 0.3% in August, means this could be the day when the ECB takes the historic decision to launch a huge quantitative easing programme (buying government bonds on a major scale). But it almost certainly won\u2019t be. QE may be coming soon, but it\u2019s more likely that today Draghi will talk up another weapon in the ECB\u2019s armoury. Many economists believe he\u2019ll pre-announce a plan to buy asset-backed securities (ABSs) from eurozone banks. An ABS programme could encourage banks to agree loans with businesses, so the debt can be packaged up into a new security and sold to the ECB. That might help. But Julian Jessop of Capital Economics reckons the ECB must launch QE eventually... It has also been our long-held view that the ECB will eventually be forced to adopt full-blown quantitative easing (QE), involving large-scale outright purchases of government bonds. And the latest activity and price data, including evidence on inflation expectations, have surely brought the timing of that announcement forward. With interest rates so low, a further cut in borrowing costs is unlikely, but not impossible. The ECB will also update its economic forecasts; its staff are likely to have taken the red pen to June\u2019s projections, given the weak inflation and GDP figures since. It\u2019s also Bank of England decision day. We\u2019re not expecting a change in interest rates, even though the monetary policy committee split 7-2 last month. But with the services sector growing strongly last month, and construction firms struggling to find skilled staff, there\u2019s lots for the BoE to ponder. Their decision comes at noon BST. The stock markets look calm this morning, after the FTSE 100 hit a new 14 year high yesterday. Also coming up.... 9am: The UK car registrations figures, for August. 1.15pm BST: The monthly measure of US private sector employment, which will give clues to tomorrow\u2019s non-farm payroll.",

      "bodyText": "The Co-operative Group has ended its search for a new chief executive by appointing Richard Pennycook, who stepped in as temporary boss to steady the troubled mutual when his predecessor walked out in March. The group also announced its first-half results, which showed a return to profit after posting an annual loss of \u00a32.5bn for 2013. In the six months to 5 July, pre-tax profit was \u00a3116m compared with a loss of \u00a31bn in the first half of last year. But operating profit, excluding losses on discontinued operations, was down to \u00a343m from \u00a3105m, as profits fell at its food and funeral businesses and it made losses in general insurance and legal services. Pennycook, who stepped in when the previous boss Euan Sutherland quit after details of his \u00a36.6m pay package were leaked to the Observer, will be paid a salary of \u00a31.3m plus bonuses. He was appointed without interviewing candidates from outside the group after the Co-op's members approved an overhaul of group governance at the weekend. The Co-op came close to collapse last year and governance reform was seen as vital to stabilise the business and allay the concerns of banks it owed \u00a31.4bn. Ursula Lidbetter, who chairs the group, said the board could not have interviewed candidates for the job before the governance vote was passed and that it had decided to act quickly. \"It would have been very time consuming and costly to have gone out with a formal [recruitment] process. Richard has the experience and the right attributes to run a cooperative society.\" Pennycook had said he was not interested in being chief executive permanently. But on Thursday he said governance reforms, including installing business people as directors to replace largely amateur Co-op members, had changed his mind. He also claimed to have been won over to the idea of co-operative values. Pennycook said: \"For me, the defining moment was the governance change at the weekend. That unlocked for me the attractive prospect of leading the organisation permanently. I had a very strong view that this is a national institution and a unique organisation which should be important in the nation. \"After many years in the plc world I was very excited by the possibility of operating in a cooperative environment where that purpose really is unique.\" Lord Myners, whose report the changes were based on, told the Guardian on Sunday that the Co-op needed to recruit strong executives from outside the group for the reforms to work effectively. Pennycook argued he and his team matched up to Myners' standards. \"If you look at the whole executive team we are strong executives largely from outside the group. In that respect, what we have on the executive team is very much what you're describing.\" Pennycook joined the Co-op as chief operating officer in June 2013 from the supermarket group Morrisons where he was finance director. He was part of a new management team headed by Sutherland, a former B&amp;Q head. Sutherland was unpopular with members who believed he wanted to turn the group, founded by the Rochdale pioneers 170 years ago and owned by its 8m customers, into a plc. When Sutherland quit in March he branded the Co-op \"ungovernable\". Since taking over, Pennycook has agreed to sell the Co-op's farms for \u00a3249m and pharmacy business for \u00a3620m. On Tuesday, the group announced it was selling its Sunwin security services business to the cash machine operator Cardtronics for up to \u00a341.5m. Pennycook said the group would sell about 200 large food stores in the next few years and replace them with convenience stores, whose underlying sales rose by 4% in the first half. He warned that after cutting \"a number of thousands\" of jobs there would be more job reductions in store for the group's 87,000 employees but that cuts would be handled sensitively. About half the money from selling the three businesses will be used to pay off borrowing, leaving the group with about \u00a31bn of debt, which Pennycook said was manageable. The rest will be used to revamp stores, cut prices and launch new products under the new strapline \"championing a better way of doing business for you and your communities\". The group's dividend, paid out to members according to how much they spend each year, will be put on hold.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "British consumers continued to splash out on new cars in August, extending the record unbroken run of sales growth to two-and-a-half years. New car sales were 9.5% higher than August 2013, with 72,163 vehicles registered, according to the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT). It marked the 30th consecutive month of growth in new car sales, the longest since records began in 1959, with consumers spurred on by cheap finance deals and a desire for more fuel-efficient models. August is typically one of the quietest months for new car sales, falling just before the September plate change and accounting for abound 3% of annual sales. September usually accounts for about 18% of new car sales each year. Economists said growth in August sent a positive signal about the industry's short-term health but warned that weak wage growth and the prospect of rising interest rates may start to weigh on the car market. Howard Archer, chief UK economist at IHS Global Insight, said: \"The economic fundamentals still look largely positive for the motor industry which will hopefully fuel ongoing healthy car sales \u2013 although the growth rate is highly likely to ease back given double-digit growth both in 2013 and over the first eight months of 2014. \"One concern for car manufacturers is that extended low earnings growth could become a constraint for private car sales while some consumers will also be worried by the prospect that interest rates will start to rise before long.\" The Bank of England is expected to raise interest rates in the early months of next year. Rates have been on hold at an all-time low of 0.5% since March 2009 in response to the financial crisis. Wage growth has lagged behind inflation for much of the past six years, with persistent falls in real pay. Such pressure on household finances has not been reflected in the new car sales data. A total of 1.53m new cars have been registered in 2014 so far, 10.1% more than at the same stage last year. Last month, the SMMT raised its 2014 forecast for new car sales for the second time this year. It now expects sales to jump 8.1% to 2.45m, underpinned by cheap finance deals and a better-than-expected economic backdrop, with unemployment falling faster and consumer confidence at higher levels. The Ford Fiesta was the bestseller in August, followed by the Ford Focus and Vauxhall Corsa, mirroring the top three best sellers in the year to date. Mike Hawes, SMMT chief executive, said buyers were snapping up \"enticing deals on a wealth of advanced new products\". He added: \"The UK's performance in the context of Europe is particularly impressive, with growth consistently ahead of the rest of the EU for the past two years. As the UK market starts to find its natural level, we expect to see the growth level off during coming months.\" David Raistrick, UK automotive leader at Deloitte, said there were other risks to the new UK car market, as well as rising borrowing costs. \"Aside from a potential interest rate rise, the biggest challenge facing the automotive retail sector will be the impact of the increasing numbers of nearly new used vehicles returning to the market. \"This could detrimentally affect residual values with the knock-on effect that the used-vehicle purchase becomes a more competitive proposition \u2013 bringing an element of balance back to the industry.\"",

      "body": "<p>Economic growth will slow in the second half of the year as the effect of improved confidence and better credit conditions starts to wear off, the CBI has predicted.</p> <p>The business group said the recovery was \"on solid ground\" but expected expansion to ease to 0.7% in the third quarter and 0.6% in the final three months of the year, after growth of 0.8% in each of the first and second quarters.</p> <p>It also warned of political risks including the possibility of a Scottish yes vote on independence \u2013 described as a \"one-way ticket to uncertainty\".</p> <p>The CBI expressed concern about the possibility of a Labour government intervening in the energy sector and other markets if the part wins next year's general election. But it insisted it was non-party political and was also \"not very keen\" on the Conservatives' migration targets.</p> <p>Its director general, John Cridland, said the possibility of a yes vote in the Scottish independence referendum was \"the most important risk that the CBI and business are facing\".</p> <p>\"The economic case for Scottish independence has not been made,\" he said. \"Overwhelmingly, British business believes that the UK should stay together.\"</p> <p>The CBI's deputy director general, Katja Hall, went one further, calling it \"a one-way ticket to uncertainty and there is no return\".</p> <p>The CBI also increased its forecast for house price growth for this year to 9.5%, up from 3.5% in 2013, with a prediction of 5.3% for next year.</p> <p>Its forecast for GDP growth for this year and next remained unchanged at 3% and 2.7%, respectively.

      "bodyText": "Economic growth will slow in the second half of the year as the effect of improved confidence and better credit conditions starts to wear off, the CBI has predicted. The business group said the recovery was \"on solid ground\" but expected expansion to ease to 0.7% in the third quarter and 0.6% in the final three months of the year, after growth of 0.8% in each of the first and second quarters. It also warned of political risks including the possibility of a Scottish yes vote on independence \u2013 described as a \"one-way ticket to uncertainty\". The CBI expressed concern about the possibility of a Labour government intervening in the energy sector and other markets if the part wins next year's general election. But it insisted it was non-party political and was also \"not very keen\" on the Conservatives' migration targets. Its director general, John Cridland, said the possibility of a yes vote in the Scottish independence referendum was \"the most important risk that the CBI and business are facing\". \"The economic case for Scottish independence has not been made,\" he said. \"Overwhelmingly, British business believes that the UK should stay together.\" The CBI's deputy director general, Katja Hall, went one further, calling it \"a one-way ticket to uncertainty and there is no return\". The CBI also increased its forecast for house price growth for this year to 9.5%, up from 3.5% in 2013, with a prediction of 5.3% for next year. Its forecast for GDP growth for this year and next remained unchanged at 3% and 2.7%, respectively. The CBI said the recent period of accelerating growth would ease as the initial impact of business and consumer confidence, improving credit conditions and reductions in uncertainty started to wear off. The slowdown also reflected weakness in productivity and wage growth, the CBI said, but added that it expected a gradual improvement, predicting average earnings to increase by 1% this year and by 2.4% in 2015. Its view that signs of a pick-up in pay growth would be needed before any interest rate hike backed the stance of the Bank of England governor, Mark Carney, who led most of the rate-setting monetary policy committee in not voting for a rise last month. Cridland also brushed off suggestions that Carney's apparent changes of tack on when rates would rise were confusing. Cridland said: \"The UK's recovery is on solid ground, with our quarterly growth on average outstripping G7 competitors over the last year. For the rest of the year, we expect growth to get onto a more even keel and the recovery to become further entrenched next year. \"Business investment has been growing better than expected so far this year, but it still has a lot of catching up to do to get back to its pre-crisis level. \"Although hundreds of thousands of new jobs are being created in the economy, there is little upward pressure on starter salaries outside a few hotspots, such as in parts of the IT sector. \"For longer-term staff though, awards are often a little higher. We expect wages to pick up across the board next year as the recovery continues.\" A separate CBI survey showed economic growth slowed in the three months to August, with a five-month low of +21%. Cridland said heightened tensions in Ukraine and the Middle East added to risks such as higher commodity prices and global market instability. With party conference season approaching, he urged politicians in the UK \"to focus on the UK's long-term economic security, not just on winning the political race\". Cridland urged parties to commit to adopting the outcome of the Davies commission on airport capacity, saying businesses were \"not going to accept cherry-picking\" of the proposals and wanted to see \"diggers on the ground before 2020\". He said that as political positions of the major parties took shape ahead of the election there were \"things in each of the emerging manifestos that we like and things that we don't like\". He added: \"I think it's clear that business has some doubts about the Labour party proposals about intervening in markets. \"In response to public concern about the perceived failings of some markets \u2013 in financial services, in energy, in housing \u2013 we are seeing proposals from Labour to intervene more in markets than governments have for the past generation.\" In another development, the CBI was also launching a \"great business debate\" to highlight the positive contribution made to society, as well as to answer public concerns on issues such as wages, diversity and tax contributions.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Standard Life plans to return \u00a31.75bn of capital to shareholders \u2013 almost a fifth of its current market value \u2013 after agreeing a surprise sale of its 180-year-old Canadian business for \u00a32.2bn in cash. The buyer is the Canadian insurer Manulife and the two companies have agreed to collaborate globally to distribute each other's investment products. The disposal and the alliance with Manulife represents another shift by Standard Life away from traditional insurance policies and towards asset management. David Nish, chief executive of the Edinburgh-based group, said \"most people would think we have got a good price\" for the Canadian business, which comprises the group's savings, retirement, insurance and investment management businesses in the country. The \u00a32.2bn price tag represents almost twice the book value of the business, about 19.5 times earnings. Standard Life will book a \u00a31.2bn gain on the sale. The disposal was announced and the terms, plus the payment to shareholders, should see Standard Life's share price open higher this morning. \"We have transformed our Canadian operations into a business which has consistently delivered strong results, contributing to the overall success of the group,\" said Nish. \"As a result, the Canadian business is now a much more attractive proposition and the sale allows us to realise fully the value of the business for our shareholders.\" The cash return to shareholders is worth 73p a share, compared with Standard Life's share price yesterday of 386p. Following the distribution, Nish said the group will have handed out \u00a33.5bn, or 147p per share, to shareholders since 2010, including dividends and special dividends. The latest handout, to follow completion of the sale early next year, will be via a so-called \"B/C share scheme\" to allow UK shareholders to take the proceeds either as income or capital. Standard Life said the Canadian corporate pensions and retail savings are \"attractive but highly competitive\" and that a sale to a large domestic player was \"more likely to maximise value for Standard Life shareholders than retaining the business and pursuing an independent strategy in Canada\". But Nish said the collaboration agreement with Manulife meant Standard Life was not leaving Canada. Manulife will distribute Standard Life Investments products throughout retail markets in Canada, the US and Asia. In return, Standard Life will distribute Manulife products in the UK. Standard Life will revamp its Boston office as a \"hub\" for its entire North American business and open a new office in Toronto to serve institutional customers. \"The collaboration is a natural extension of our existing strategy where we have established a range of global strategic partnerships and relationships,\" said Keith Skeoch, chief executive of Standard Life Investments, the fund management division. Nish was coy on what the group would do with the remaining proceeds after the \u00a31.75bn return of capital. But the UK savings market, transformed by the chancellor George Osborne's shakeup of the pensions and annuity market, is likely to be one area as investment firms rush to create new savings vehicles. India, where Standard Life has invested in leading local insurance and fund management companies, could be another avenue. Standard Life has been vocal this year in warning of uncertainties around the financial makeup of an independent Scotland in the event of a yes vote. Last month Nish said: \"We do not believe that further clarity has been provided on any of these issues.\" Last night he said the group was comfortable with its preparations, which have included setting up subsidiaries in England as a contingency, and was looking forward to dealing with \"the new reality, whatever it is.\"",
