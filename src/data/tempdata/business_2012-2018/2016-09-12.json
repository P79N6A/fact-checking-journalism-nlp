      "bodyText": "The accumulated wealth of Britain\u2019s richest 1% is more than 20 times the total of the poorest fifth, making the country one of the most unequal in the developed world, according to analysis by Oxfam. The anti-poverty charity said the figures suggest that the property, pensions and shares owned by around 634,000 of the UK\u2019s richest people are worth 20 times as much as the assets held by the poorest 13 million. In a plea to Theresa May, the charity said the government needed to take action to close the gap between the \u201chaves\u201d and the \u201chave nots\u201d, adding that the UK\u2019s inequality problem was likely to be a contributing factor in the vote to leave the European Union. Significant rises in property prices over the last 20 years, especially in London and south-east England, have combined with generous boardroom retirement schemes to boost the wealth of the richest, while those who rent and have no pension have seen their wealth remain unchanged or decline. The report said: \u201cThe UK is one of the most unequal developed countries in the world. Three decades of high-level inequality have had a profound impact, leading many people to believe that they have little stake in society and to feel locked out of politics and economic opportunity. \u201cWhatever your views on Brexit, the referendum brought divisions within our country to a head, with many people expressing distrust and disconnection with political processes and voting for change in the hope that it would improve their economic position.\u201d The report used data from investment bank Credit Suisse, which showed the richest 10% own more than half of the country\u2019s total wealth. The top 1% own just less than a quarter of the total wealth (23%), while the poorest 20% share just 0.8% of the country\u2019s wealth between them. Researchers from Credit Suisse said last year that wealth inequality in the UK has risen since 2000 \u201cas the gap in wealth per adult between the lower segment and rest of the population has increased\u201d. The Oxfam paper welcomed the prime minister\u2019s recognition of the need to shake-up corporate culture and suggested a four-point action plan for her to adopt. It said the tax system needed to be overhauled so the richest members of society and major corporations paid their fair share of tax. It also called for curbs on excessive pay, extra funding for skills training and greater worker representation on boards.",

      "bodyText": "Britain\u2019s employers have refused to panic following the referendum vote, but new jobs are likely to become increasingly scarce as concerns over Brexit talks undermine business confidence. Recruitment agency Manpower said that, on the surface, the EU referendum had done little to dampen firms\u2019 immediate recruitment plans. Official figures show employment is steady and the number of people claiming jobseeker\u2019s allowance is falling. However, Manpower said the UK jobs market was \u201cskating on thin ice\u201d, with cracks starting to appear in many areas of the economy. A survey of more than 2,100 employers showed that companies in business and financial services, construction and utilities were less optimistic than before the referendum, while prospects also fell in manufacturing. Employers in several sectors said they were concerned that key staff would be affected by a block on EU workers staying in the UK. The survey chimes with a raft of similar reports showing that employers are nervous about Brexit negotiations that could see the UK leave the single market and impose strict limits on EU workers coming to Britain. The ratings agency Standard &amp; Poor\u2019s said signs of a post-referendum recovery should be treated with caution because a rebound in August only made up for ground lost in July. \u201cWhile the news is encouraging, we believe it has no bearing on the cloudy longer-term outlook for the UK economy,\u201d said Sophie Tahiri, an economist at S&amp;P Global Ratings. An expansion over the next few months could be viewed as the economy returning to \u201cbusiness as usual\u201d, but this may prove to be premature or even a mirage, she said. \u201cThe uncertainty surrounding the UK\u2019s future outside of the EU \u2013 and the associated economic risks, which we think are pronounced and predominantly skewed to the downside \u2013 will gradually take its toll, particularly on investment, as businesses start dealing with the new Brexit reality,\u201d Tahiri said. Manpower said the government\u2019s austerity cuts were also taking their toll, cutting the number of jobs in the public sector, especially in local government. \u201cConducted in the weeks following the referendum, the survey shows that while UK job prospects have held firm, cracks in the ice are appearing, with six out of nine sectors surveyed reporting a fall in jobs optimism,\u201d the report said. Mark Cahill, Manpower\u2019s UK managing director, said: \u201cAfter the initial shock of Brexit, we\u2019re entering a new phase of prolonged economic uncertainty. The future of freedom of movement across the EU is of particular concern.\u201d Cahill said employers were reliant on European talent to help fill skills shortages, especially in IT and the City. Manpower said financial centres in the EU were circling financial institutions in the City to steal work and skilled staff. It said there had been an 800% increase in applications for finance positions in Dublin since the EU referendum. Many employers in the health service and care sector also rely on foreign workers from the EU and were concerned about filling skills gaps. The study found that job prospects in the public sector had fallen to the weakest level in four years, dragged down by forecasts of further rounds of redundancies in local government.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Primark is taking on only a handful of former BHS stores including Reading, Llandudno and Leicester\u2019s Fosse Park as it tackles falling sales and a \u00a3200m-plus leap in its pension deficit. Sales at the cut-price fashion chain\u2019s established stores slid 2% in the UK, and for the group as a whole, in the year to 17 September, as it struggled against a warm autumn, chilly spring and difficult July, when shoppers were put off by the Brexit vote. Parent company Associated British Foods (ABF) added that the EU referendum\u2019s impact on bond yields would have a detrimental effect on its pension fund, pushing it to a year-end deficit of \u00a3200m, compared to a small surplus last year. The company said pension service costs next year would be higher and John Bason, ABF finance director, said it was likely to be one of a number of businesses warning on the issue. Shares in ABF dived nearly 11% to \u00a328.15 and were the biggest faller in the FTSE 100 index in the light of the poor sales at Primark and the big jump in the pension deficit. Bason said shoppers had a \u201cbit of a shock\u201d for a couple of weeks after the EU referendum on 23 June but trade had bounced back with better weather from late July. \u201cYou can\u2019t see from the UK consumer a [long-term] Brexit effect,\u201d he said. ABF said Primark\u2019s total sales for the 53 weeks to 17 September were 9% higher than a year earlier, stripping out currency fluctuations. But the company blamed unseasonal weather for an expected fall of 2% for sales at established stores. It said temperatures were unusually warm before Christmas and very cold in early spring. The company warned in April that trading was tough for Primark after the chain suffered its first half-year fall in underlying sales for 12 years. In July it said sterling\u2019s fall would have mixed results for its overall business and that Primark\u2019s margins would be hurt. The pound has fallen against the dollar for the past two years, dropping about 20% in that time, but the decline accelerated after the vote to leave the EU. Sterling has dropped more than 10% since the referendum on 23 June as traders expected lower interest rates and a slowing economy. In its trading update, ABF said overall trading for the group was ahead of its earlier expectations, helped by improved performance at its sugar business and rising profits at its grocery and food ingredients operations. It added that Primark would not get a major lift from the demise of BHS, which closed the last of more than 160 stores in August, and planned to take on only a \u201csmall handful\u201d of premises vacated by the defunct chain. Primark has recently opened an outlet in BHS\u2019s former Fosse Park store in Leicester and will open in Carlisle in October after the council bought back the lease. It is also moving into former BHS stores in Reading and Llandudno. Bason said the new stores were part of ongoing expansion in the UK that formed part of 1.3 million sq ft of new space planned around the world in the year ahead. That included three more stores in the US, taking the total to eight, three more in Italy, where it currently has just one outlet, and three or four more in France, where it has eight stores. He said Primark was \u201cwell placed\u201d for the run-up to Christmas as it was determined to keep prices low despite a squeeze on profit margins caused by the pound\u2019s fall since the EU referendum. He said the retailer was \u201ccommitted to leading the value sector\u201d. Bason said retailers\u2019 costs were likely to rise towards the end of 2016 as a result of sterling\u2019s decline against the US dollar, which it uses to buy much of its products overseas, but it was too early to see what effect that might have on trade. \u201cThe UK consumer at the moment still has more money in their pocket but it awaits to be seen how much general inflation happens in the economy,\u201d he said.",

      "bodyText": "Confident assertions are being made about what will happen to the City after Brexit. Sir Charlie Bean, former deputy governor of the Bank of England, said last week that he had \u201cabsolutely no doubt at all\u201d that euro-denominated clearing of interest rate derivatives would be moved into the European Union. Then chancellor Philip Hammond said the exact opposite, suggesting the EU would be foolish to attempt such a manoeuvre because it would only hand business to New York. London, Hammond argued, benefits from economies of scale that EU countries shouldn\u2019t try to smash out of \u201cnarrow and hypothetical national advantage\u201d. Such arguments go to the heart of the debate about the wisdom of allowing the London Stock Exchange to merge with Deutsche B\u00f6rse, a \u00a324bn deal that now faces about six months of regulatory scrutiny. Before the vote for Brexit, the pitch from the pair was straightforward, almost compelling. The duo would be a European powerhouse to compete with the big US houses, led by ICE (owner of the New York Stock Exchange), and oil the wheels of the European economy. All that was required was for both sides to accept a new structure in which the holding company would be based in London but local regulators would continue to oversee local entities as if nothing had changed. The structure is clever and shareholders duly approved the terms, so now it\u2019s up to the regulators and politicians to protest if they wish. The European commission will fret about the possible loss of competition. The specific UK worry, however, is obvious: if, despite Hammond\u2019s advice, EU governments try to slice off chunks of City business, are their chances improved by the LSE/Deutsche merger? Hammond\u2019s relaxed stance is understandable up to a point. The Frankfurt-based European Central Bank has always been infuriated that London dominates euro-denominated trading but it has lost one court battle on the matter and, say most lawyers, the UK\u2019s exit from the EU wouldn\u2019t alter the basis of the relevant judgment. What\u2019s more, sensible EU business folk might complain if Berlin or Paris tried to undermine London; they would worry that the price of capital could go up for them. All the same, Bean\u2019s warning shouldn\u2019t be dismissed lightly, or without proper scrutiny. It\u2019s very odd, for example, that Xavier Rolet, chief executive of the London Stock Exchange, is in charge of studying market infrastructure for Baroness Vadera\u2019s post-Brexit financial services taskforce; as an architect of the Deutsche deal, he\u2019s hardly impartial. What\u2019s needed is a specific national interest study. If it concludes that the merger should be paused until the terms of Brexit are decided and proper assessments can be made, so be it. The Deutsche/LSE deal is too important to the City to be waved through on the merry assumption that things will probably work out OK in the end. Who are the UK\u2019s fat executives? International trade secretary Liam Fox, if he had wanted to attack the UK\u2019s \u201clazy\u201d business culture seriously, could have pointed to the UK\u2019s large balance of trade deficit and compared it with Germany\u2019s surplus. Fox didn\u2019t do that, however. Maybe there were two reasons why. First, successful German exporters tend to enjoy more financial support from local and central government, which doesn\u2019t suit Fox\u2019s agenda. Second, the UK\u2019s exports of goods and services per capita are the third highest in the G7, after Germany and Canada, as economist Andrew Sentance pointed out. Downing Street declined to endorse Fox\u2019s remarks. That was wise. Theresa May, let\u2019s hope, will go further and invite Fox to shame those \u201cfat\u201d UK executives he thinks play golf on Friday afternoons instead of negotiating export deals. If the golf line was a throwaway, let\u2019s hear about all the deals Fox thinks could have been done. Without evidence, his generalisations are absurd. Exit Shafik Deputy governors of the Bank or England are meant to last more than two years, so Dame Nemat Shafik\u2019s escape to the London School of Economics is big news in the small world of central banking. It\u2019s hard to detect any falling-out in the glowing tribute from governor Mark Carney. And the Bank\u2019s review of fair and effective markets, overseen by Shafik, received generally favourable reviews. So one assumes she really does find the pull of academia too great. Yet it would be struggle to say Shafik has established a high profile. When she arrived from the IMF in August 2014, some people thought Carney had hired a potential successor; it\u2019s been a while since that theory was aired.",

      "bodyText": "Marks &amp; Spencer has confirmed that Laura Wade-Gery, one of the UK\u2019s few female FTSE 100 board directors, will not be returning from maternity leave and is to exit the company at the end of September. Wade-Gery, multichannel director of UK retail and online operations, will receive a payoff worth up to \u00a32.4m in cash and shares, although only about \u00a3560,000 of that is guaranteed and the rest dependent on the performance of M&amp;S over the next few years. She will receive only eight months\u2019 of her \u00a3569,000 salary in monthly instalments. The departure of Wade-Gery, 51, a former Tesco director who was once tipped as M&amp;S\u2019s next chief executive, comes after she completed a year off at the beginning of this month. Her exit marks the loss of one of the UK\u2019s few female FTSE 100 board directors and comes as efforts to appoint more women to senior positions at Britain\u2019s biggest companies have stalled. Fewer than 10% of the three most senior positions at FTSE 100 firms are held by women according to a report published in July. While there is no suggestion that Wade-Gery faced discrimination, the exit of such a high-profile woman at the end of her maternity leave is also likely to highlight the challenges new mothers face on return to work. A report by MPs published last month found 77% of pregnant women and new mothers experience discrimination at work, compared with 45% 10 years ago. Less than a quarter of FTSE 100 boardroom recruits in the six months to March 2016 were women, the lowest level since 2011, according to the Female FTSE Board Report. Wade-Gery is not thought to have been close to M&amp;S\u2019s new chief executive Steve Rowe and in her absence her responsibilities have were shared out among other directors. She said: \u201cI have had five very happy years at M&amp;S. I\u2019ve been away from the business for a year now, and that time has seen some significant changes in both my personal life and in the business. I concluded that the time was right to move on from M&amp;S. I wish Steve and all my colleagues and friends every success.\u201d Wade-Gery will step down from M&amp;S\u2019s board with immediate effect and formally leave the company at the end of September. Robert Swannell, chair of M&amp;S, said: \u201cOn behalf of the board, I would like to thank Laura very much for the significant contribution she has made in her five years at M&amp;S. Laura has been a valued member of the Board and instrumental in the improvement and modernisation of our e-commerce and multi-channel capabilities. We wish her all the very best for the future.\u201d Wade-Gery\u2019s exit comes as Rowe tries to slim down M&amp;S\u2019s head office operations and cut costs as he battles to turn things around after the retailer\u2019s biggest fall in clothing sales since the 2008 banking crisis. Last week Rowe confirmed plans to cut 525 jobs from M&amp;S\u2019s London head office and move another 400 roles outside the capital as part of a \u00a315m shakeup. The retailer is consulting with head office staff including those in buying, merchandising and marketing about the job cuts, which are part o Rowe\u2019s attempts to reduce costs and simplify the business. The net reduction in staff numbers, which first emerged over the weekend, will be achieved through a combination of redundancies, non-replacement of leavers and cutting contractors. On top of the job cuts, 400 IT and logistics staff will move from central London to M&amp;S\u2019s IT centre in Stockley Park, Middlesex, and its distribution hub in Hemel Hempstead, potentially enabling the company to move out of one of its two head office buildings near Paddington. M&amp;S has said it remains committed to investing more in improving the experience in stores for customers there will not be no cuts in shop-floor staff. But the new chief executive, who took the top job after nearly 30 years at M&amp;S, has already faced criticism over changes to pay and pensions for shop workers including cutting premium pay for Sundays. After more than 90,000 people signed a petition calling on the chain to scrap the changes M&amp;S agreed that staff would receive extra compensation to ensure their pay did not fall below current levels in future.",

      "bodyText": "Federal Reserve governor Lael Brainard, a noted dove at the central bank, has hinted that it should not raise interest rates too quickly. In the last scheduled speech from a Fed official before the bank\u2019s interest rate setting committee meets next week, she set a notably more cautious tone about the economy. This contrasts with recent comments from other Fed members suggesting a possible rate rise at next week\u2019s central bank meeting, which were partly responsible for volatile stock market movements in the last couple of days. Speaking in Chicago, Brainard said the Fed must be careful not to remove its monetary stimulus too quickly because of potential weakness in the jobs market and the risk of foreign economic downturns. Saying the jobs market might be further from full strength than some economists believe, which meant \u201cthe caste to tighten policy pre-emptively is less compelling.\u201d Her comments are being live-streamed here and her speech is here. The dollar has lost more than 1% against the yen and is down 0.4% against the pound after her comments were released, while on Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average is up 118 points or 0.64%. On that note, it\u2019s time to close for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. Over in Greece, mission chiefs representing international creditors have returned to the country to begin what is likely to be another contentious review of the economy. Helena Smith reports from Athens: It\u2019s September. The summer is over and the auditors are back. There is, and has always been, a cyclical quality to Greece\u2019s long-running debt crisis but six years on it is a sense of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu that comes against a background of poverty and immiseration made worse by the passage of time. Talks resumed today with inspectors focusing on accelerating the government\u2019s long-delayed privatisation program and rooting out corruption \u2013 endemic and, as such, a major curse for the economy. Once again Athens has been told in no uncertain terms that the heat is on: failure to implement 15 major prior actions, or reforms, will result in non-disbursement of the next tranche of aid, at \u20ac2.8bn vital for the debt-stricken economy. Publicly, the leftist-led government is keen to complete what will amount to a second review of the economy in the 13 months since it signed up to a third, \u20ac86bn bailout as soon as possible. Finance ministry sources speak of September 29, when the next Euro working group is held, as a deadline. Creditors have also made clear that debt relief negotiations \u2013 central for real economic recovery to even begin \u2013 can only be countenanced once further austerity is enforced. Such policies would include abolishment of protection laws against mass lay-offs \u2013 a huge red line for the ruling Syriza party. And prime minister Alexis Tsipras, once the pin-up for anti-austerians Europe-wide, is feeling the heat. Latest polls have repeatedly shown the leftists to be trailing the main opposition centre right New Democracy party with approval ratings for Tsipras himself plummeting. One recent survey showed only 19% of Greeks viewed the leader favorably with a massive 85% dissatisfied with a government they had initially voted in to dismantle policies blamed for run-away unemployment and soaring impoverishment. The leftists\u2019 penchant for replacing cuts with taxes has exacerbated the disgruntlement. All of which is why few believe this latest chapter will end anytime soon - with ever growing numbers believing that Greece will only regain competitiveness when it eventually leaves the eurozone. The final scores in Europe showed: The FTSE 100 finished down 76.05 points or 1.12% at 6700.90, its lowest level since the start of August Germany\u2019s Dax was down 1.34% at 10,431.77 France\u2019s Cac closed 1.15% lower at 4439.80 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB fell 1.84% to 16,840.28 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended 1.76% lower at 8866.6 In Greece, the Athens market lost 1.68% to 557.25 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 63 points or 0.36%. After early plunges this morning, European markets have recovered from their worst levels. For much of the day the FTSE 100 was suffering its worst day since the immediate aftermath of the Brexit vote in June, with a similar story on the Dax. Much of the falls came after Friday\u2019s comments from Federal Reserve members suggesting a US rate rise was possible next week, with the news of Hillary Clinton\u2019s illness adding to the uncertainty. But Wall Street regained its poise and in turn gave a lift to European markets. Joshua Mahony, market analyst at IG, said: US stock markets have managed to regain their composure this afternoon, bouncing off the lows for the time being. What has been widely heralded as a result of hawkish comments from the Fed\u2019s Rosengren seems to have had as much to do about the implications of finally breaking out of a two month lull in US indices. Volumes and thus volatility seem to be back, much to the joy of traders worldwide. Given that Rosengren\u2019s speech signified a no more divisive message than we have already heard from him and other Fed members, it seems the key is in the market\u2019s willingness to run with it as the curtains fall on the holiday season. This afternoon\u2019s speech from Fed\u2019s Brainard represents the final appearance before the pre-meeting blackout period. The noted dove is expected to temper fears sparked by Rosengren, yet with market sensitivity heightened, any shift in tone could set markets on their way once more. As part of its economic stimulus measures, the Bank of England has announced it will start buying \u00a310bn worth of corporate bonds on September 27. It will hold three reverse auctions a week and will spread the purchases over 18 months. It said the bonds would need to be issued by companies that make a significant contribution to the economy, and were not part of the financial services sector. In the corporate world, Marks &amp; Spencer has just announced that executive director Laura Wade-Gery will not return to the retailer following her maternity leave. She will step down from the board immediately and leave the company at the end of this month. Wall Street has recovered some ground ahead of a speech by US Federal Reserve governor Lael Brainard in Chicago. This is scheduled to be the last major Fed speech before next week\u2019s meeting of the central bank\u2019s rate setting committee, so will be scrutinised for clues as to whether a rate rise is likely or not. With Brainard being notably dovish on Fed policy, any change in her tone could be significant. But investors seem to have calmed down after Friday\u2019s talk of a rate rise sent global markets tumbling. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is now up 50 points or 0.28%, while the FTSE 100 has come off its worst levels. The UK index is down 81 points, hovering near its worst level since the immediate post-Brexit decline. Oil prices are under pressure again as hopes of an agreement by major producers to stablise the market faded once more. The falls came after OPEC said output from producers outside the organisation was stronger than expected. It forecast a fall in non-OPEC production of 610,000 barrels a day this year, which is 180,000 barrels less than previously expected, after American output held up despite lower prices. And OPEC raised its predictions for next year\u2019s production from non-member counties. Reuters reports: OPEC raised its forecast of oil supplies from non-member countries in 2017 as new fields come online and U.S. shale drillers prove more resilient than expected to cheap crude, pointing to a larger surplus in the market next year. Demand for crude from the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries will average 32.48 million barrels per day (bpd) in 2017, OPEC said in a monthly report on Monday. That is down from the previous forecast of 33.01 million bpd. The prospect of a larger surplus than expected adds to the challenge of OPEC and non-members such as Russia, who are making a renewed attempt to restrain supplies. Oil is trading at $47 a barrel, half its level of mid-2014, as a supply glut that OPEC hoped cheap oil would banish sticks around. OPEC revised up its 2016 and 2017 non-OPEC supply forecasts, citing factors including the start up of Kazakhstan\u2019s Kashagan oilfield and a lower-than-expected decline in U.S. shale output, and said the immediate outlook was for more production. So Brent crude is currently down 1.17% at $47.45 a barrel while West Texas Intermediate - the US benchmark - has fallen 1.29% to $45.29. The global market slump which began on Friday with Wall Street and moved to Asia and Europe has continued with the re-opening of the US market after the weekend break. After renewed concerns about a US rate rise next week, came the news of presidential candidate Hillary Clinton\u2019s illness which added to the uncertain mood for investors. But the opening fall was not as bad as initial estimates had suggested. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 34 points or 0.19% after talk of a three digit decline. Not everyone is convinced that Fed board member Dennis Lockhart is right about wage growth accelerating: After six hours of lively trading, Britain\u2019s stock market is still heading for its worst day since the end of June. The FTSE 100 is down 102 points right now, a drop of over 1.5%, at 6673. Europe\u2019s stocks are deeper in the red, as investors continue to worry that central bankers might be running out of ammunition. The big speech of the day, from the Fed\u2019s Lael Brainard isn\u2019t due until 6.15pm, when European markets will have closed. Conner Campbell of SpreadEx says: It\u2019s one of those days where it is hard to pluck any nuance from the blanket market movements. The FTSE, DAX and CAC are all haemorrhaging points to the tune of 1.6%, 2% and 2.1% respectively, marking an aggressive intensification of the losses each index saw at the start of the day. Part of the problem is that these rate hike worries have really hit the commodity sector, with UK oil and mining stocks especially clogging up the morning\u2019s losers list. Despite most of the blame being pinned on the market\u2019s Fed fears the Dow Jones futures are currently signalling a US open that isn\u2019t quite as bad as what is going on in Europe. Newsflash: Federal Reserve policymaker Dennis Lockhart has just calmed some nerves about a rate hike next week. Lockhart, the president of the Atlanta Fed, told an audience that there should be a \u201cserious discussion\u201d about raising interest rates. But he also cautioned that wage growth doesn\u2019t seem to be feeding through to the inflation rate; a hint that rates don\u2019t need to go up yet? That may protect Wall Street from heavy losses when the market opens in 45 minutes. Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis President Neel Kashkari has moved swiftly to rebut Donald Trump. Kashkari insists that the Fed is independent of the White House, and sets monetary policy on the economy\u2019s merits. He told CNBC that: \u201cPolitics simply does not come up. We look at the economic data and ... everyone around the table is committed to achieving our dual mandate.\u201d Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump has just weighed in - warning Americans that interest rates won\u2019t stay at their near record-lows forever. Speaking on CNBC, Trump reminded the nation that US interest rates once hit 21% under Jimmy Carter. What\u2019s going to happen when interest rates could go up? And they could go up.... We\u2019re living like there\u2019s no interest rates, because we\u2019re paying almost no interest. In a typically rumbustious performance, Trump also claimed that the Federal Reserve \u201cwasn\u2019t even close to being independent\u201d. Fed chair Janet Yellen should be \u201cashamed\u201d to have kept interest rates so low to assist Barack Obama, he added. Shares in Associated British Foods have now slumped by 11%, as the City slams it for a disappointing trading update today. The Brexit vote is partly to blame; the fall in the pound will drive up costs at its Primark operation next year. But it has also suffered weaker sales, which it blames on Britain\u2019s (predictably) unpredictable climate (basically it was too warm before Christmas, and then too cold in early spring). Celebrities and top politicians are trying their hand at City trading today, as part of the annual BGC charity day. This is the 12th time that BGC Partners and Cantor Fitzgerald have held the event, to remember the loss of 700 employees in the 9/11 terrorist attacks on the World Trade Centre. All today\u2019s revenues go to various charities; and actress Joanna Lumley, London Mayor Sadiq Khan , TV presented Davina McCall and top cyclist Mark Cavendish have already done their bit. Traders in New York are waking up to the news that Asian and European markets have fallen back today. Wall Street started this selloff on Friday, when the Dow fell by 2%, or almost 400 points. The futures market is predicting that the Dow will shed another 112 points, or 0.6%, when trading begins in two and a half hours. Here\u2019s our news story about Samsung, whose valuation slumped by $14bn today thanks to its problem with exploding smartphones: Credit rating agency Standard &amp; Poor\u2019s has urged us not to get carried away by recent encouraging UK economic data. In a new report, just released, S&amp;P warn that July\u2019s encouraging inflation, retail sales and unemployment figures might just be a \u201cmirage\u201d, not an accurate signal. S&amp;P analyst Sophie Tahiri says: \u201cThe uncertainty surrounding the U.K\u2019s future outside of the E.U. and the associated economic risks, which we think are pronounced and predominantly skewed to the downside, will gradually take its toll, particularly on investment, as businesses start dealing with the new Brexit reality\u201d. We get updated economic data on the UK this week (inflation on Tuesday, unemployment on Wenesday), which will show how August played out. Britain\u2019s mid-cap index, which includes companies too small for the FTSE 100, is also falling sharply today. The FTSE 250 has fallen by 1.5%, or 256 points, this morning. Challenger bank Aldermore is down 5.2%, while oil consultancy firm Amec Foster has lost 4.6%. Again, speculation that the US Federal Reserve might whip away the punchbowl by raising interest rates soon is being blamed. Chris Beauchamp of City firm IG, says this afternoon\u2019s speech from Fed official Lael Brainard is looming over the markets (reminder, she speaks at 6.15pm BST). Investors are terribly worried that she might hint at a rate hike. The blame has been pinned on the Fed\u2019s Eric Rosengren, but he hardly said anything novel on Friday, warning as he did that rates would probably rise gradually. With so little on the calendar for today the speech by Fed member Lael Brainard has acquired a greater degree of importance, with any departure from her previous dovish stance likely to occasion some degree of additional panic. The term \u201csea of red\u201d can be abused, but today\u2019s market action certainly deserves it. As the tweet below show: Shares are down, with some markets shedding 2% Most currencies have fallen against the US dollar, most government bond prices have fallen, pushing up yields The cost of insuring government debt through a credit default is rising And oil and metal prices are dropping. I mentioned earlier that the Greek debt crisis was bubbling up again, after prime minister Tsipras attacked the country\u2019s creditors. And we now have fresh signs that Europe is losing patience with Athens. Brussels officials are briefing that they\u2019re unhappy about the slow pace of reforms, and warning that the next slice of bailout funds (worth \u20ac2.8bn) won\u2019t be handed over until the situation improves. Here are the newswire snaps: The Athens stock market is already the worst-performing European market today, down by 3.2%. Minouche Shafik\u2019s surprise resignation means the Bank of England must hand someone else the job of unwinding its quantitative easing stimulus programme (this was one of her key responsibilities). The Brexit vote, though, means exiting QE has fallen down the agenda -- there\u2019s more chance of the BoE expanding the scheme, if it fears we\u2019re heading into recession.... Newsflash: Bank of England deputy governor Nemat \u201cMinouche\u201d Shafik is leaving the BoE next February. Shafik, who only joined the BoE two years ago, will move to the London School of Economics, to become its next director (the top role at the LSE). It\u2019s a surprise move -- Minouche became one of the most powerful women in UK finance when she became the BoE\u2019s first deputy governor, on a five-year term. She currently oversees banking and markets at the central bank. Governor Mark Carney says : We will say farewell to Minouche with gratitude and regret. She helped drive vital reforms on the domestic and international stages, perhaps most prominently in the successful completion of the Fair and Effective Markets Review which she co-chaired. Central bank stimulus packages have been a massive factor in driving up asset prices since the financial crisis; today\u2019s selloff show investors are worrying that the party is over. Conor Deering of City firm Clear Treasury explains: There are several factors at play here, the key one of course being the continued uncertainty around whether the Fed will act on lifting US interest rates as early as next week. The other more recent matter being the ECB and their decision not to extend QE at last week\u2019s policy meeting. We have also had some disappointments from the Bank of Japan, with no sign of helicopter money or the 100 year bond, policies which had been eagerly anticipated. The question now is, have central banks started to change their tune on fiscal stimulus and its effectiveness? There\u2019s an old market mantra that when shares fall, bonds should rise. The logic is that as investors abandon risky equity, they put their money in safe-haven government debt instead. But that\u2019s not happening today - instead, shares AND bonds are falling, in sync. That suggests that the City is particularly nervous today, as it ponders whether central banks can\u2019t be relied on to push prices ever higher. Hong Kong\u2019s stock market had a particularly bad day, closing 3.3% lower, with every share dropping. Commodity prices are also taking a beating this morning. Copper and iron have both hit its lowest level since June, while the oil price has shed 1.7% to $47.40 per barrel. That\u2019s a consequence of the US dollar rallying, on the back of talk of an interest rate hike soon. Niv Dagan, executive director at Peak Asset Management LLC in Melbourne, told Bloomberg Radio that: \u201cCentral banks are reluctant to add additional stimulus and that\u2019s causing a lot of concern.\u201d \u201cWe expect additional downside in the near term. You want to wait and see and remain cautious. After an hour of volatile trading, the FTSE 100 is down 107 points at 6669, a five-week low. Asian shareholders are nursing some bruises tonight: It was particularly bloody in South Korea, where Samsung\u2019s shares tumbled over 6% after it warned that its flagship Note 7 phone might catch fire. Customers have been told to turn the devices off and get a replacement.... European stock markets aren\u2019t a pretty picture this morning, as they head for their biggest one-day loss since late June. Virtually every share on the FTSE 100 index is falling this morning. That has dragged the blue-chip index down to a five-week low, as it suffers its biggest fall since the EU referendum results. Here\u2019s the damage: Tony Cross of Trustnet Direct blames a cocktail of worries: Markets finished last week with a rather tumultuous backdrop of rising oil inventories and the resurgent prospect of a US rate hike. This certainly rattled sentiments, but as the new week gets underway there\u2019s already another factor investors are having to contend with as questions are asked over the health of Hilary Clinton, just as the US Presidential campaign reaches a critical point. The \u201cwave of risk aversion\u201d gripping markets today could be the start of a serious correction, warns FXTM Research Analyst Lukman Otunuga: Global stocks may be poised for steeper losses if the combination of central bank caution and fading optimism towards the effectiveness of stimulus measures forces investors to scatter from riskier assets. With concerns still elevated over the health of the global economy and the oversupply woes ensuring oil prices remain depressed, stock markets could be set for a heavy selloff. And we\u2019re off! Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 index of blue chip shares has fallen by 89 points at the start of trading, a drop of 1.3%. The City is following the selloff in Asia, driven by fears that central banks may be running out of ammunition with which to stimulate the global economy. Mining companies are leading the rout, with BHP Billiton down 4.4% and Anglo American losing 4.3%. They might suffer if US interest rates are raised next week, as a stronger dollar might hurt growth in emerging markets. And there are biggest losses in Europe, with the Frankfurt exchange leading the way down... German DAX: -1.9% France\u2019s CAC: -1.6% Spain\u2019s IBEX : -1.9% Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB: -1.6% Concerns over Hillary Clinton\u2019s health are also hitting shares today, after the Democratic presidential nominee was diagnosed with pneumonia. Mike Van Dulken of Accendo Markets says Clinton\u2019s illnesss may alarm Wall Street, and prompt \u201cfurther pessimistic trading from our counterparts across the Atlantic today\u201d. Government bonds are also suffering a selloff this morning, driving prices down their lowest levels in three months. That also shows angst that central banks may soon rein in their stimulus levels. Germany\u2019s 10-year bond yield (the interest rate on the debt) has jumped to 0.03% - up from 0.016% on Friday. That\u2019s still an astonishingly low rate, but perhaps the long bull market in bonds is turning a corner? Jasper Lawler of CMC Markets says European Central Bank chief Mario Draghi helped spark the selloff; last week, Draghi dampened expectations that the ECB might boost its QE bond-buying programme. Bondholders suddenly didn\u2019t like the idea of holding onto a negative-yielding asset which could fall in price if there\u2019s no central banking buying alongside them. Stock market volatility has also spiked this morning, showing that investors are more nervous: Here\u2019s our latest report on the Asian market selloff: Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Summer is over, folks. Global stock markets are falling today as investors fret that central banks may end the stimulus measures that have bathed them in cheap money for years. Anxiety that America\u2019s Federal Reserve may raise interest rates next week is driving shares down, after several weeks of market calm. And there\u2019s also lingering disappointment that the European Central Bank didn\u2019t even discuss extending its quantitative easing programme last Thursday. That has already prompted significant falls in Asia, where Japan\u2019s Nikkei shed 1.7% and the Australian market lost more than 2%. And European markets are expected to follow suit when trading begins at 8am BST, extending Friday\u2019s selloff. IG are predicting that the FTSE 100 will fall by almost 100 points at the open. That would put it on track for its biggest loss since the aftermath of the EU referendum in June. Shareholders are looking nervously at America, for signs that the Fed might hike borrowing costs for the first time this year at its September 21 meeting. One policymaker, Lail Brainard, is giving a speech tonight...and may show her hand. Brainard is a dovish member of the Fed, so any hint of an imminent rate hike could cause alarm on Wall Street. Elsa Lignos, senior currency strategist at RBC Capital Markets, says: Brainard\u2019s speech today takes on undue importance, as the timing of a speech by the Fed\u2019s most noted dove, just ahead of the FOMC blackout period, is too much of a coincidence for some.... Brainard speaks at 1.15pm Washington time, or 6.15pm in the UK. Investors are also getting jittery about Greece again, after eurozone finance ministers told Athens to get serious about implementing reforms. Prime minister Alexis Tsipras hit back last night, claiming that the \u201cconstant clashes and disagreements\u201d between Greece\u2019s creditors are holding the country back. On the corporate front, we\u2019re getting results from Associated British Foods (which owns fashion chain Primark) and infrastructure group John Laing. There\u2019s no much economic data in the diary, though, to distract investors from worrying about those central banks....",

Helena Smith reports from Athens:</p> <blockquote> <p>It\u2019s September. The summer is over and the auditors are back. There is, and has always been, a cyclical quality to Greece\u2019s long-running debt crisis but six years on it is a sense of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu that comes against a background of poverty and immiseration made worse by the passage of time. Talks resumed today with inspectors focusing on accelerating the government\u2019s long-delayed privatisation program and rooting out corruption \u2013 endemic and, as such, a major curse for the economy. </p> <p>Once again Athens has been told in no uncertain terms that the heat is on: failure to implement 15 major prior actions, or reforms, will result in non-disbursement of the next tranche of aid, at \u20ac2.8bn vital for the debt-stricken economy. Publicly, the leftist-led government is keen to complete what will amount to a second review of the economy in the 13 months since it signed up to a third, \u20ac86bn bailout as soon as possible. Finance ministry sources speak of September 29, when the next Euro working group is held, as a deadline.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c7d7bb839be19359b56966624f131465e79a0312\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c7d7bb839be19359b56966624f131465e79a0312/0_117_2554_1533/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Alexis Tsipras.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Alexis Tsipras.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alexandros Avramidis/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <blockquote> <p>Creditors have also made clear that debt relief negotiations \u2013 central for real economic recovery to even begin \u2013 can only be countenanced once further austerity is enforced. Such policies would include abolishment of protection laws against mass lay-offs \u2013 a huge red line for the ruling Syriza party.</p> <p>And prime minister Alexis Tsipras, once the pin-up for anti-austerians Europe-wide, is feeling the heat. Latest polls have repeatedly shown the leftists to be trailing the main opposition centre right New Democracy party with approval ratings for Tsipras himself plummeting. One recent survey showed only 19% of Greeks viewed the leader favorably with a massive 85% dissatisfied with a government they had initially voted in to dismantle policies blamed for run-away unemployment and soaring impoverishment. The leftists\u2019 penchant for replacing cuts with taxes has exacerbated the disgruntlement. All of which is why few believe this latest chapter will end anytime soon - with ever growing numbers believing that Greece will only regain competitiveness when it eventually leaves the eurozone. </p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57d6cf10e4b013613fffc863\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-12T16:01:43.283Z\">5.01pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The final scores in Europe showed:</p> <ul> <li><strong>The FTSE 100 finished down 76.05 points or 1.12% at 6700.90, its lowest level since the start of August</strong></li> <li><strong>Germany\u2019s Dax was down 1.34% at 10,431.77</strong></li> <li><strong>France\u2019s Cac closed 1.15% lower at 4439.80</strong></li> <li><strong>Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB fell 1.84% to 16,840.28</strong></li> <li><strong>Spain\u2019s Ibex ended 1.76% lower at 8866.6</strong></li> <li><strong>In Greece, the Athens market lost 1.68% to 557.25</strong></li> </ul> <p>On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 63 points or 0.36%.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-09-12T16:02:01.448Z\">at 5.02pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-57d6cb33e4b013613fffc852\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-12T15:40:11.973Z\">4.40pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Markets recover from post-Brexit lows</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>After early plunges this morning, European markets have recovered from their worst levels.</p> <p>For much of the day the FTSE 100 was suffering its worst day since the immediate aftermath of the Brexit vote in June, with a similar story on the Dax.</p> <p>Much of the falls came after Friday\u2019s comments from Federal Reserve members suggesting a US rate rise was possible next week, with the news of Hillary Clinton\u2019s illness adding to the uncertainty.</p> <p>But Wall Street regained its poise and in turn gave a lift to European markets.

What has been widely heralded as a result of hawkish comments from the Fed\u2019s Rosengren seems to have had as much to do about the implications of finally breaking out of a two month lull in US indices. Volumes and thus volatility seem to be back, much to the joy of traders worldwide.</p> <p>Given that Rosengren\u2019s speech signified a no more divisive message than we have already heard from him and other Fed members, it seems the key is in the market\u2019s willingness to run with it as the curtains fall on the holiday season. This afternoon\u2019s speech from Fed\u2019s Brainard represents the final appearance before the pre-meeting blackout period.

Standard &amp; Poor\u2019s said signs of recovery should be treated with caution because a rebound in August only made up for ground lost in July. \u201cWhile the news is encouraging, we believe it has no bearing on the cloudy longer-term outlook for the UK economy,\u201d said Sophie Tahiri, an economist at S&amp;P Global Ratings. Tahiri said the economy recovered in August after the Bank of England cutinterests rate to 0.25% and deployed a range of other measures to stimulate an economy that appeared to be heading for recession. \u201cA barrage of new data for August suggests that the economic hit may have been a temporary reaction. The rebound suggests that the short-term impact of the Brexit vote is less severe than many had thought,\u201d she said. \u201cUnfortunately, it doesn\u2019t categorically rule out any negative short-term impact.\u201d Companies reported a slump in business in July before a bounceback in August. Forecasters that predicted a recession after a no vote, including the International Monetary Fund and the Treasury, have been accused of supporting scaremongering by remain campaigners to persuade voters to stay in the EU. S&amp;P said surveys of the manufacturing, construction and services sectors in July and August showed the two months largely cancelling each other out to give a picture of a \u201cbroadly stagnating\u201d economy. An expansion over the next few months could be viewed as the economy returning to \u201cbusiness as usual\u201d, but this may prove to be premature or even a mirage, said Tahiri. \u201cThe uncertainty surrounding the UK\u2019s future outside of the EU and the associated economic risks, which we think are pronounced and predominantly skewed to the downside, will gradually take its toll, particularly on investment, as businesses start dealing with the new Brexit reality,\u201d she said. The British Chambers of Commerce (BCC) has more than halved its GDP growth prediction for next year from 2.3% to 1.0%, reflecting concerns that employers will be reluctant to recruit new staff and invest. Higher inflation and stagnant wages will also limit consumer spending. If growth slows to 1% it would mark the worst economic performance since 2009, when the UK was emerging from a deep recession sparked by the global financial crisis.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Tata Steel slumped to another loss in the three months to the end of June as the crisis that has engulfed its UK operations weighed on the company\u2019s global results. The Indian steel firm\u2019s European division, which includes Port Talbot steelworks in Wales and several other plants in the UK, enjoyed an operating profit of \u00a390m during the quarter. The company put the improved performance down to cost cuts in the UK and a boost in exports thanks to the weakness of sterling after the EU referendum. But Tata Steel fell \u00a3360m into the red on a group-wide basis after tax, when including a \u00a3370m loss on the sale of its UK long products business. Tata sold the division to investment group Greybull Capital for a nominal sum earlier this year in a deal that saw it crystallise a loss on the asset. Executive director Koushik Chatterjee said that, despite the impact of the UK on Tata\u2019s balance sheet, its British operation enjoyed a \u201csignificant benefit\u201d during the quarter from the weakness of the pound. But he did not offer any update on discussions with German rival ThyssenKrupp about setting up a pan-European joint venture. Tata suspended the sale of Port Talbot in July to give it time to explore a larger tie-up with ThyssenKrupp that the firms believe could help address overcapacity in the European steel industry. One stumbling block is the British Steel pension scheme, which has 130,000 members and a \u00a3700m funding deficit. Chatterjee said: \u201cWe need more time \u2013 there is the complication of pensions. All bidders come with a univocal approach \u2013 that pensions have to be separated from the business.\u201d He warned observers not to read too much into the \u00a390m quarterly operating profit within Tata Steel Europe, given that this was due largely to the weakness of the pound. \u201cCurrency is always short term,\u201d he said. \u201cToday we see a more depreciated pound, which is where exporting competitiveness has improved. That provides a lever [for the UK business] to sustain itself ... but that\u2019s very fickle.\u201d The company added that the currency effect will not be beneficial only to UK exporters. \u201cThe weaker pound is expected to improve [the] UK\u2019s short-term competitive position on exports. However, it will add cost pressure due to higher cost of raw materials purchased in US dollars.\u201d It also warned that the UK\u2019s growth \u201cmay slow down following the referendum result\u201d. However, Chatterjee was more circumspect about the likely long-term effect of Brexit. \u201cWe don\u2019t know how trade agreements will pan out between UK and the rest of EU and rest of world. We\u2019ve got to watch and wait and see,\u201d he said. Nonetheless, he was optimistic about the government\u2019s commitment to supporting key industries. \u201cThere is a clear signal to look at industrial strategy in a more focused manner. When the government has more to talk about, we\u2019ll get to know more about the industrial strategy for the UK. \u201cThese are early days and we should give the government time to frame its thought, because it also has huge work ahead in terms of the whole Brexit complication.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "A deputy governor of the Bank of England has quit after just two years in one of the most prominent central banking roles. Dame Nemat Shafik, better known by her nickname Minouche, had a five-year contract at the Bank but resigned to become the first woman to run the London School of Economics. The Egyptian-born economist, who is a British and US national, was appointed when the Bank was undergoing a restructuring under the then new governor, Mark Carney. Her role overseeing banking and markets was a new one and gained importance as she oversaw a review of financial markets after the Libor rigging and foreign exchange manipulation scandals. Shafik also has a seat on the monetary policy committee, which sets interest rates, and the financial policy committee, which is charged with avoiding new crises in financial markets. She is also responsible for the Bank\u2019s electronic money printing exercise \u2013 quantitative easing (QE) \u2013 and on her appointment was charged with \u201chelping to lead the design and execution of an eventual exit from quantitative easing\u201d. Since June\u2019s vote for Brexit, the MPC announced another \u00a360bn of gilts will be bought to extend QE \u2013 and that announcement on 4 August was the only time Shafik voted for change to interest rates at the 25 MPC meetings she has attended. Rates were cut to 0.25%. When she was appointed, Shafik, who also represented the Bank on international committees, was regarded as a potential candidate to succeed Carney. The governor\u2019s term is scheduled to end in June 2018 although he has indicated he could stay longer. Shafik is one of four deputy governors at the Bank, a structure created by Carney to adapt to powers handed to Threadneedle Street in response to the 2008 banking crisis. She will leave the Bank in February but will not start her new role at the London School of Economics until September, after six months\u2019 gardening leave.

      "bodyText": "The world\u2019s biggest corporations have increased their wealth compared with nation states in the last year, illustrating the growing power of multinational businesses. A study by the anti-poverty charity Global Justice Now found that the number of businesses in the top 100 economic entities jumped to 69 in 2015 from 63 in the previous year. While many emerging market economies have struggled to grow in the last couple of years, mainly as a result of China\u2019s slowdown, many of the world\u2019s largest corporations have increased in size. The London-based campaign group said the 10 biggest corporations \u2013 including Walmart, Apple and Shell \u2013 make more money than most countries in the world combined. The charity blamed governments for bowing to pressure from multinational firms to promote business-friendly tax regimes above the needs of their citizens. An assessment of the top 200 entities found that many smaller countries were squeezed out, leaving 153 corporations above many nations from Africa, Asia and South America. The US, China, Germany, Japan, France and the UK make up the top six economic entities followed by Italy, Brazil and Canada. Walmart ranks as the 10th largest, followed by China\u2019s electricity monopoly State Grid at number 14, China National Petroleum at 15 and Chinese oil firm Sinopec Group at 16. Apple ranked 26th behind the 18th-placed Royal Dutch Shell, with Exxon Mobil at 21, Volkswagen at 22 and Toyota at 23. The value of the top 10 corporations was $285tn (\u00a3215tn), beating the $280tn worth of the bottom 180 countries, which include Ireland, Indonesia, Israel, Colombia, Greece, South Africa, Iraq and Vietnam. Nick Dearden, the charity\u2019s director, said: \u201cThe vast wealth and power of corporations is at the heart of so many of the world\u2019s problems \u2013 like inequality and climate change. \u201cThe drive for short-term profits today seems to trump basic human rights for millions of people on the planet. These figures show the problem is getting worse.\u201d Global Justice Now said it released the figures to increase pressure on the British government ahead of a UN working group, led by Ecuador, that aims to draw up a binding treaty \u201cto ensure transnational corporations abide by the full range of human rights responsibilities\u201d. Campaigners said they are calling for the treaty to be legally enforceable at a national and global level. The charity has criticised Britain for refusing to support the process. Dearden said: \u201cThe UK government has facilitated this rise in corporate power through tax structures, trade deals and even aid programmes that help big business. \u201cTheir wholehearted support for the US-EU trade deal TTIP, is just the latest example of government help to big business. Disgracefully, it also routinely opposes the call of developing countries to hold corporations to account for their human rights impacts at the UN.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Name: Queues. Age: As old as these fair isles themselves. Appearance: As British as a bulldog eating cucumber sandwiches off a monocle. I feel as if I\u2019ve spent my entire life in a queue. You haven\u2019t. You have, according to estimates, spent between one and six months in them. Is that all? Because I\u2019ve been to Alton Towers. It\u2019s true, and it\u2019s too long for some. A crack team of mathematicians have been figuring out how to reduce the time we spend queuing. Oh, that\u2019s easy \u2013 use the \u201cbaskets only\u201d tills. Nope. Dan Meyer, chief academic officer of US mathematics organisation Desmos, has worked out that the fastest way to get through the supermarket queue is to stand behind someone with a full trolley. That\u2019s madness. Hasn\u2019t this Meyer chap ever been to a Lidl? Your problem is that you\u2019re assessing the queue by items, and not by people. Huh? You know what eats up more time than anything else in a supermarket queue? Pleasantries. According to Meyer, 41 seconds of each transaction in California is spent chatting with the server. That\u2019s 41 seconds you have to add to every person in front of you in the baskets-only line. This adds up. I think I\u2019ve spotted the flaw in your argument. You have? This is based on a study carried out in California, where it\u2019s sunny and people generally like each other. So you\u2019re saying that in the UK, where it\u2019s rainy and miserable and everyone clomps about quietly hating everything they see, the results will be different. Exactly. Again, this Meyer chap really needs to get to a Lidl. Wait, though, we can still adapt these findings to British supermarkets. We can? Sure. Instead of looking at trolleys or the number of people in front of you, just keep an eye open for the chatty checkout assistants and avoid them at all costs. I get it. Same goes for shoppers. If anyone in front of you looks lonely, then they\u2019ll probably gab on, too. Best avoid them as well. So whenever you go shopping, you say we should specifically seek out the highest density of cold-hearted sociopaths? Exactly! Rule Britannia. Do say: \u201cJust scan my items and shut up.\u201d Don\u2019t say: \u201cHello\u201d, \u201cPlease\u201d or \u201cThank you\u201d.",

      "bodyText": "The former Conservative pensions minister, Ros Altmann, has launched an extraordinary attack on the Bank of England for making pensions ruinously expensive for employers while enjoying lavish subsidies from the taxpayer for its own pension scheme. It has emerged that employees, led by the Bank\u2019s governor, Mark Carney, received the equivalent of a 50%-plus salary contribution into their pensions last year, underwritten by the taxpayer. Most private employers pay 5-10% of salary into pensions, with many large companies struggling to cope with widening deficits in their schemes. Lady Altmann, who was pensions minister under David Cameron, blamed the Bank\u2019s quantitative easing programme (QE) for creating ever-larger deficits, while itself being insulated from the problems caused by its policies. \u201cThe private sector cannot just keep on putting more and more money into the seemingly bottomless pension pit,\u201d said Altmann, accusing the Bank of complacency. \u201cThe Bank has been insulated from the problems caused by QE because its own pension scheme is funded by taxpayers.\u201d QE, where the Bank of England creates money to buy government bonds, has the effect of pushing down the interest rate, or yield on government bonds. It means lower mortgage rates, and lower interest rates on bank deposits. But it also spells hardship for final-salary-based pension funds, as lower interest rates mean investments will not grow as much to meet the bill for paying future pensioners. So employers have to pay more in now to fill the gap. In a detailed analysis of the Bank\u2019s pension scheme circulated to the media on Monday, Altmann said its employer contributions exceeded 50%. \u201cThe Bank of England scheme required employer contributions of well over 50% of salary for the year ending February 2016. It also pays all the administration and [pension protection fund] costs, on top of the employer contributions. Such costs would be ruinous for most private sector employers struggling to fix their defined benefit pension deficits.\u201d Royal Mail is typical of companies in the private sector with expensive final-salary-style pension schemes. It faces a battle with its 140,000 workers over plans to slash its employer contribution from 45% of salary to 12%, claiming the cost was \u201csimply unaffordable\u201d. Altmann said: \u201cTaxpayers fund the enormous employer contributions which have been required to overcome the Bank of England pension scheme deficit, while Bank of England employees do not contribute at all. This may help explain why the Bank of England seems so complacent about the pension problems created by its policies. However, the problems are real for most employers and may undermine the effectiveness of QE itself. These side-effects need to be taken more seriously.\u201d She also accused the Bank of being, in effect, hypocritical after expecting pension schemes to change their approach to managing money and future risks \u2013 while doing nothing itself to change. The theory behind the Bank\u2019s QE programme is that as it drives down interest rates on bonds, businesses and consumers spend and invest rather than keeping their money on deposit. Altmann argues this is not happening. \u201cQE is meant to be expansionary as institutions switch to riskier assets \u2013 but even the BofE scheme isn\u2019t doing this. Since the [EU referendum] the combined impact of Brexit uncertainty and the \u00a370bn QE boost has led to a significant further drop in long yields. \u201cThe Bank of England says QE will impart monetary stimulus and \u2018trigger portfolio rebalancing into riskier assets by current holders of government bonds\u2019. But even the Bank of England\u2019s own pension scheme is not switching to higher-risk assets. Most institutional investors, such as pension funds or insurers, do not take more risk due to regulatory constraints. Therefore, QE may not be working as intended. This helps to explain why the Bank has already struggled to find enough bonds to buy.\u201d She highlighted how the Bank\u2019s pension scheme was entirely invested in bonds that have failed to keep up with future liabilities to former employees. \u201cEven though it is fully invested in gilts and bonds, it has had to overcome a deficit and, although it moved back to 99% funding in early 2016, the latest round of QE may cause further underfunding. But the Bank can rely on ever-increasing contributions from taxpayers,\u201d Altmann said. \u201cPushing long rates down is not going to fix the economy and is causing pension problems that are being worryingly ignored. QE has damaging side-effects that could undermine its intent. Especially as the UK has so much money in funded pensions and insurance \u2013 much more than other countries.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Leading shares are heading for their biggest one day fall since the end of June, the aftermath of the Brexit vote, on a cocktail of concerns. Associated British Foods is the biggest loser so far, down 6.5% to \u00a329.50 after the Primark and sugar business issued a disappointing trading update. It said Primark\u2019s full year like for like sales were expected to be down 2% after unseasonable weather and the recent falls in sterling. The company\u2019s pension scheme also reported a \u00a3200m deficit after being in surplus last year. Mining shares are also under pressure, on concerns about global growth and a stronger dollar on the prospect of a rise in US interest rates. Anglo American is down 48p at 798.6p, while BHP Billiton is 52p lower at 965.5p. Banks are weaker with Royal Bank of Scotland down 8.2p at 198.5p and Barclays off 6.6p at 168.15p. RBS has been downgraded from hold to sell by Investec with analyst Ian Gordon saying: After RBS\u2019 participation in the recent sector rally, we downgrade to sell (from hold). Minor forecast changes take our target price to 200p (from 205p). Barclays (hold) is our preferred \u201crecovery play\u201d while Lloyds (buy) is our preferred FTSE100 bank. However, we continue to see far greater upside within the UK \u201cchallenger bank\u201d sub-sector; we highlight OneSavings (buy), Shawbrook (buy) and Virgin Money (buy), while we think Aldermore (buy) is the most underappreciated, undervalued story of all.
