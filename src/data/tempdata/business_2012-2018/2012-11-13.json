Davey pledged the government would \"support the regulators taking whatever steps necessary to ensure the full force of the law is applied\" if it is found that prices have been deliberately distorted. The row could spread to Europe on Wednesday as the whistleblower and gas price reporter at the centre of the row, Seth Freedman, meets senior EU officials to explain his concerns. The Guardian revealed on Monday that Freedman had taken a dossier of data and documents allegedly showing price manipulation in the wholesale gas market to the Financial Services Authority. Both the FSA and the energy regulator, Ofgem, which was separately approached by Freedman's employer ICIS Heren, at his request, have now launched investigations. On Tuesday more industry insiders came forward to express their concerns.

Jason Torquato, who also worked at ICIS Heren as a gas-price setter, said he was certain any manipulation of indices created by the price-reporting agencies could \"influence retail gas prices\". He said he had noted \"half a dozen or a dozen\" occasions that price differentials over the course of a year looked unusual, with one particularly marked case on 9 September 2011. Davey, who was broadly aware of the allegations since Friday, has been determined to be seen to act, and given the scale of voter anger at energy prices, to avoid any whiff of complacency. During his statement there were widespread calls from all parties for action to protect energy consumers, as well as concern that other areas, including food prices, might also be open to abuse. Tory MPs called for the book to be thrown at whoever was responsible. Davey insisted he did not want to prejudge the inquiries launched in the wake of the allegations, adding that the investigations were at an early stage, but he said they could involve either civil or criminal offences.

The report is likely to be the second deeply critical review of the SFO in four years. His predecessor, Richard Alderman, used a damning report by former New York prosecutor Jessica De Grazia as the justification for a radical overhaul of the SFO shortly after his appointment four years ago. That upheaval saw many senior prosecutors and managers forced out. Many of Alderman's refocusing initiatives are now being reversed. Green stressed the SFO should \"never\" turn down a case on the grounds that the agency did not have the resources. He said the SFO, which this month moves to a new headquarters near Trafalgar Square, would supplement its workforce with \"surge capacity\" when big cases came along. \"We have made significant progress towards a new funding model for the SFO, which is a matter close to my heart,\" he said. The Treasury has already promised it will provide an additional \u00a33.5m to fund the Libor investigation. Green told the justice committee: \"I think there was historically a perception that the SFO was more willing to do a deal than to prosecute \u2026 What I have done is restate the purpose of the SFO, I think it got a bit blurred over time.\" Green said he had launched four major investigations since taking charge at the SFO \u2013 believed to be a reference to the Libor inquiry; the reopening of an investigation into failed hedge fund group Weavering; a bribery probe into a UK subsidiary of Airbus maker EADS in relation to a contract with the Saudi National Guard; and an inquiry into payments made by Barclays Bank to Qatar Holdings at the height of the 2008 banking crisis. The SFO head has also removed the automatic immunity from prosecution offered to those companies coming forward with admissions that they had been involved in bribery. He said this was likely to have little impact on \"genuine self-reporting\" companies. Asked if the SFO was looking at the allegation of market fixing in the energy sector revealed this week in the Guardian, Green gave little away. \"It is a matter we would consider, as with other cases,\" he said.",

    "webTitle": "University tuition fee increase sends inflation back up again", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Spiralling university tuition fees and dearer food bills helped send the inflation rate sharply higher last month prompting warnings from business that the rising cost of living puts the economy at risk of a fresh period of weak growth. The British Chambers of Commerce (BCC) and the Federation of Small Businesses (FSB) said the squeeze on living standards from rising prices was likely to hit demand over the coming months. The predictions came after the Office for National Statistics released figures showing that the annual increase in the cost of living as measured by the consumer prices index rose from 2.2% to 2.7%, the first upward move since July. Inflation has now been above the government's 2% target for 35 months in a row and only below its official benchmark nine times in the past six-and-a-half years. John Walker, the chairman of the FSB, said: \"It is disappointing that inflation has risen as the trend for the past year has been downwards. However, with energy costs set to rise and the potential increase in fuel duty in January, we are concerned about the pressure this will add to household and business finances. We hope this doesn't act as a brake on consumer spending and dampen confidence, especially in the runup to Christmas.\" David Kern, the BCC's chief economist, said the rise put recovery in jeopardy following Britain's exit from double-dip recession in the third quarter of 2012. \"Higher inflation is unwelcome news for the UK economy at a time when the government is persevering with its tough austerity plan. In the face of major economic challenges, there is only limited scope for the UK to rebalance towards exports and investment over the next year.\" Education costs rose by more than 19% in October \u2013 the biggest one-month increase on record \u2013 as this year's new undergraduates were hit by a near-tripling of tuition fees to \u00a39,000 a year. Britain's wet summer also had an effect on grocery bills, with the ONS blaming a poor vegetable crop for higher food prices. Other measures of inflation also rose. The annual increase in the retail prices index \u2013 used as the benchmark for many wage claims \u2013 stood at 3.2% in October, up from 2.6% in September. The jump in inflation was far higher than the City had been expecting and triggered fears that the UK could drift into a triple-dip recession over the winter. A Treasury spokesman admitted the October increase in inflation was \"disappointing\", but noted that the annual rate was well down on its recent 5.2% peak in September 2011. \"The government has taken action to help people with the cost of living, including freezing fuel duty and council tax and taking 2 million people out of income tax altogether,\" the spokesman added. Analysts said the short-term outlook was for inflation to rise further over the coming months in response to higher energy and food bills. Ros Altmann, director-general of over-50s specialists Saga, said: \"This increase in inflation is further dreadful news for savers as the combination of low interest rates and high inflation has had disastrous effects on disposable incomes and the spending power of millions of households which means monetary policy has actually damaged significant parts of the economy. Stagflation is here and set to get worse.\" Unite's general secretary, Len McCluskey, said: \"We are in a desperate situation where millions of working people and their families are juggling rising food and energy bills when household incomes for the majority of people have not kept pace in recent years. Where families lead in suffering, shops and businesses will follow.\"",

      "body": "<p>Spiralling university tuition fees and dearer food bills helped send the inflation rate sharply higher last month prompting warnings from business that the rising cost of living puts the economy at risk of a fresh period of weak growth.</p> <p>The British Chambers of Commerce (BCC) and the Federation of Small Businesses (FSB) said the squeeze on living standards from rising prices was likely to hit demand over the coming months.</p> <p>The predictions came after the Office for National Statistics released figures showing that the annual increase in the cost of living as measured by the consumer prices index rose from 2.2% to 2.7%, the first upward move since July. Inflation has now been above the government's 2% target for 35 months in a row and only below its official benchmark nine times in the past six-and-a-half years.</p> <p>John Walker, the chairman of the FSB, said: \"It is disappointing that inflation has risen as the trend for the past year has been downwards. However, with energy costs set to rise and the potential increase in fuel duty in January, we are concerned about the pressure this will add to household and business finances. We hope this doesn't act as a brake on consumer spending and dampen confidence, especially in the runup to Christmas.\"</p> <p>David Kern, the BCC's chief economist, said the rise put recovery in jeopardy following Britain's exit from double-dip recession in the third quarter of 2012. \"Higher inflation is unwelcome news for the UK economy at a time when the government is persevering with its tough austerity plan. In the face of major economic challenges, there is only limited scope for the UK to rebalance towards exports and investment over the next year.\"</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-399332233\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/maps_and_graphs/2012/11/13/1352809580690/Inflation-chart-004.png\" alt=\"Inflation chart\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Inflation chart Photograph: Graphic</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Education costs rose by more than 19% in October \u2013 the biggest one-month increase on record \u2013 as this year's new undergraduates were hit by a near-tripling of tuition fees to \u00a39,000 a year.</p> <p>Britain's wet summer also had an effect on grocery bills, with the ONS blaming a poor vegetable crop for higher food prices.</p> <p>Other measures of inflation also rose. The annual increase in the retail prices index \u2013 used as the benchmark for many wage claims \u2013 stood at 3.2% in October, up from 2.6% in September.</p> <p>The jump in inflation was far higher than the City had been expecting and triggered <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/poll/2012/nov/06/uk-heading-triple-dip-recession\" title=\"\">fears that the UK could drift into a triple-dip recession over the winter</a>. A Treasury spokesman admitted the October increase in inflation was \"disappointing\", but noted that the annual rate was well down on its recent 5.2% peak in September 2011.</p> <p>\"The government has taken action to help people with the cost of living, including freezing fuel duty and council tax and taking 2 million people out of income tax altogether,\" the spokesman added.</p> <p>Analysts said the short-term outlook was for inflation to rise further over the coming months in response to higher energy and food bills.</p> <p>Ros Altmann, director-general of over-50s specialists Saga, said: \"This increase in inflation is further dreadful news for savers as the combination of low interest rates and high inflation has had disastrous effects on disposable incomes and the spending power of millions of households which means monetary policy has actually damaged significant parts of the economy. Stagflation is here and set to get worse.\"</p> <p>Unite's general secretary, Len McCluskey, said: \"We are in a desperate situation where millions of working people and their families are juggling rising food and energy bills when household incomes for the majority of people have not kept pace in recent years. Where families lead in suffering, shops and businesses will follow.\"</p>",

      "bodyText": "Vodafone has taken a near \u00a36bn hit after writing down the value of its Spanish and Italian operations, pushing it into a loss of almost \u00a3500m for the first half of the year. The writedown takes the total value slashed from its European businesses to \u00a310bn this calendar year, after a \u00a34bn markdown announced in May. Investors reacted by sending the shares down nearly 4% to 160p, although the sell-off was tempered by news that Vodafone will receive a \u00a32.4bn dividend from its US joint venture Verizon Wireless this year, allowing it to remain the largest dividend payer in the FTSE 100. The eurozone slump pushed organic service revenues into decline for the first time since 2010. The measure is a key one that includes income from calls, texts and internet, and excludes one-offs such as handset sales. Vodafone's chief executive, Vittorio Colao, said on Tuesday the \u00a35.9bn impairment charge reflected \"tougher market conditions, mainly in southern Europe\", as consumers curbed spending and phone companies discounted prices. Organic service revenue was down 1.4% across the group in the second quarter. It was down by 11.3% in southern Europe, up 0.7% in northern Europe and up 4.1% in Africa, the Middle East and Asia Pacific. UK organic service revenues were down 3.2%, but the overall number of customers was up 247,000 to 19.3m, with the numbers of contract subscribers using smartphones passing the halfway mark for the first time. Overall, Vodafone reported a pre-tax loss of \u00a3492m for the half year to 30 September, down from a profit of \u00a38bn last year. However, the results were lifted by growth at Verizon, which has finally said that it will pay a dividend this year, nearly 18 months after its last payout was announced. The US company, the largest mobile network in its home market, declared a dividend of $8.5bn (\u00a35.3bn), of which Vodafone's share will be \u00a32.4bn. The money will be paid by the end of the calendar year, and Vodafone promised a \u00a31.5bn share buyback once funds are received. The cash will help pay for a rise in the interim dividend, up 7.2% to 3.27p per share. A new strategy to counter falling consumer spending in Europe was announced, with Colao promising \"worry free usage\" for subscribers who are increasingly reluctant to breach their monthly calls and data limits. From September Vodafone pricing models have been simplified, \"giving clear visibility of the cost of ownership\". There are now unlimited voice and text tariffs, and \"much larger\" data allowances. The company is also promising more attractive roaming prices for those wanting to use their phones abroad. Analysts at Espirito Santo bank said the results were \"weak on a number of measures\" including service revenues, and that the dividend from Verizon was lower than the \u00a310bn expected by the City. \"We are a little disappointed by the size of the dividend,\" the bank said in a note. \"We believe [Verizon] has the capacity to pay much more.\"",

The cash will help pay for a rise in the interim dividend, up 7.2% to 3.27p per share.</p> <p>A new strategy to counter falling consumer spending in Europe was announced, with Colao promising \"worry free usage\" for subscribers who are increasingly reluctant to breach their monthly calls and data limits.</p> <p>From September Vodafone pricing models have been simplified, \"giving clear visibility of the cost of ownership\". There are now unlimited voice and text tariffs, and \"much larger\" data allowances. The company is also promising more attractive roaming prices for those wanting to use their phones abroad.</p> <p>Analysts at Espirito Santo bank said the results were \"weak on a number of measures\" including service revenues, and that the dividend from Verizon was lower than the \u00a310bn expected by the City.</p> <p>\"We are a little disappointed by the size of the dividend,\" the bank said in a note. \"We believe [Verizon] has the capacity to pay much more.\"</p>",

      "bodyText": "Starbucks has had sales of \u00a33bn cumulatively since setting up operations in the UK 14 years ago. But with nearly 800 stores across the country, it is still making a loss. How come? Here, your burning Starbucks/tax questions are answered \u2026 How much tax has Starbucks paid in the UK? A total of \u00a38.5m in corporation tax since 1998. The corporation tax rate in the UK is currently 25%. Why so little? With more than 750 coffee shops in the UK, any profit is wiped out through a number of payments which Starbucks must make to subsidiaries abroad. Such as? A 4.7% premium is paid to the Dutch division of Starbucks \u2013 the regional headquarters \u2013 for rights images and the coffee recipes. The premium, which used to be 6% before Her Majesty's Revenue &amp; Customs (HMRC) asked for it to be lowered, also includes the cost of the roasting process that takes place there. Where does it buy the coffee beans? From the company's Swiss operation at up to a 20% premium. The Lausanne-based business, which employs 30 people, buys around $1bn of coffee, making around $200m from the mark-up it charges the UK business. It pays a tax rate in Switzerland of around 12%. The company says it pays higher prices because it only buys premium coffee beans. Why does the UK operation pay a premium? The stores are not franchises, however HMRC allows companies to pay intellectual property fees to overseas parent companies if they are made at \"arm's length\". Starbucks can charge the premium if it can show that it would have agreed on the terms between the parent company and UK company even if they were not connected. Do other businesses charge a premium? Yes. McDonald's and Burger King charge premiums of up to 5% of turnover, while Wal-Mart charges UK subsidiary, Asda, 0.6% for services including royalties. However, all three make a profit in the UK and pay subsequent taxes. Any other reasons for Starbucks's low tax bill? Yes. The company spends $500m (\u00a3315m) annually on tax-deductible areas including research and development. The company also claims the rental rates on its stores in the UK are some of the highest in the world, especially in central London where some stores have already been closed because of the cost. Bosses also say they spend more on store layout and design than competitors. Starbucks also paid other group companies for unspecified services, including an unknown Swiss-based associate. The Europe, Middle East and Asia division, which oversees the UK operation, also loans cash for investment, which it then charges interest on. This can be written off against tax. \u2022 This article was amended on 15 November 2012. Starbucks pays a tax rate of 12% in Switzerland, not 5% as initially reported.",

      "body": "<p>Starbucks has had sales of \u00a33bn cumulatively since setting up operations in the UK 14 years ago. But with nearly 800 stores across the country, it is still making a loss. How come? Here, your burning Starbucks/tax questions are answered \u2026</p> <p><strong>How much tax has Starbucks paid in the UK? </strong>A total of<strong> </strong>\u00a38.5m in corporation tax since 1998. The corporation tax rate in the UK is currently 25%.</p> <p><strong>Why so little?</strong> With more than 750 coffee shops in the UK, any profit is wiped out through a number of payments which Starbucks must make to subsidiaries abroad.</p> <p><strong>Such as?</strong> A 4.7% premium is paid to the Dutch division of Starbucks \u2013 the regional headquarters \u2013 for rights images and the coffee recipes. The premium, which used to be 6% before Her Majesty's Revenue &amp; Customs (HMRC) asked for it to be lowered, also includes the cost of the roasting process that takes place there.</p> <p><strong>Where does it buy the coffee beans?</strong> From the company's Swiss operation at up to a 20%&#xa0;premium. The Lausanne-based business, which employs 30 people, buys around $1bn of coffee, making around $200m from the mark-up it charges the UK business. It pays a tax rate in Switzerland of around 12%. The company says it pays higher prices because it only buys premium coffee beans.</p> <p><strong>Why does the UK operation pay a premium?</strong> The stores are not franchises, however HMRC allows companies to pay intellectual property fees to overseas parent companies if they are made at \"arm's length\". Starbucks can charge the premium if it can show that it would have agreed on the terms between the parent company and UK company even if they were not connected.</p> <p><strong>Do other businesses charge a premium? </strong>Yes. McDonald's and Burger King charge premiums of up to 5% of turnover, while Wal-Mart charges UK subsidiary, Asda, 0.6% for services including royalties. However, all three make a profit in the UK and pay subsequent taxes.</p> <p><strong>Any other reasons for Starbucks's low tax bill? </strong>Yes. The company spends $500m (\u00a3315m) annually on tax-deductible areas including research and development. The company also claims the rental rates on its stores in the UK are some of the highest in the world, especially in central London where some stores have already been closed because of the cost. Bosses also say they spend more on store layout and design than competitors.</p> <p>Starbucks also paid other group companies for unspecified services, including an unknown Swiss-based associate. The Europe, Middle East and Asia division, which oversees the UK operation, also loans cash for investment, which it then charges interest on. This can be written off against tax.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 15 November 2012. Starbucks pays a tax rate of 12% in Switzerland, not 5% as initially reported.</p>",

Targeted mailouts and their more frustrating random cousins represent close to 50% of UK letter deliveries, said the Royal Mail, as the state-owned business published results that showed an improving financial performance \u2013 thanks, in part, to the huge volume of business from direct mail. Moya Greene, Royal Mail's chief executive, defended the prevalence of direct mail on the nation's welcome mats. Asked if she hoped the volume of magazine subscription offers and book club overtures would increase, she said: \"I hope so, because it's such a powerful medium. If it is added to national campaigns, with newspapers and broadcasting, it helps UK businesses grow, and that is what we all want.\" In 2010, 1.7bn direct mail items were sent to UK homes. Royal Mail, which has been formally separated from the Post Office network, said revenues for the six months to 23 September rose 3.3% to \u00a34.4bn, with operating profit rising from \u00a312m to \u00a3144m after restructuring costs were taken into account. Greene declined to comment on reports Royal Mail will be fully or partly privatised in the third quarter of next year, as the figures confirmed the business was becoming more resilient. Royal Mail's core UK parcels, international and letters business \u2013 which collects, sorts and delivers mail all over Britain \u2013 also recovered from a loss of \u00a341m in the same period last year to post a profit of \u00a399m. However, overall letter volumes showed another steep decline despite the resurgence in old-media marketing. Letter volumes fell 9% to 6.8bn, Royal Mail said. The Communication Workers Union said the profit proved that modernisation of Royal Mail could be successful within the public sector. The union's deputy general secretary, Dave Ward, said: \"There is no need for privatisation as a solution to business transformation.

I came into it with a background of having covered energy markets. I worked as an analyst and, partly because I knew the sector, the [ICIS] training was quite brief. But I felt that there were others who came in without my kind of background and were said to be fully trained but not sufficient to be responsible for the UK's gas bills. \"Various indices created by companies such as ICIS, Platts and Argus, to name three of the price-reporting agencies, are implemented into contracts between suppliers and end users. The idea of using those companies [ICIS etc] is that they are independent and not able to be manipulated. \"The index would make up a varying percentage of the whole thing [UK gas bills, although the price [the supplier] bought and sold would make up the bulk of the bill. Assessments made by ICIS Heren do influence retail gas prices at the end of the day.\" \u2022 Do you or have you worked in the gas market? Can you help us with this story?

      "bodyText": "European markets have closed and despite the dispute between the IMF and EU over Greece's fate, they have managed to edge higher. An opening bounce on Wall Street as well as vague talk Spain might finally request a bailout seemed to do the trick. \u2022 The FTSE 100 finished up 0.33% \u2022 Germany's Dax edged up 0.01% \u2022 France's Cac closed up 0.56% \u2022 Spain's Ibex jumped 1.66% \u2022 Italy's FTSE MIB finished 1.4% higher And the Athens stock market closed up 0.37% although the country's banking sector lost 2.8%. Meanwhile the Dow Jones Industrial Average has come off its best levels, but is still up 0.22%. Chris Beauchamp, market analyst at IG, said: Despite all its problems and the bleak future that awaits, it seems Greece has managed to find some demand for its short-term debt. An auction today managed to raise \u20ac4 billion, more than expected. In further good news, there were suggestions that Germany is looking to throw a bumper payout in Greece\u2019s direction, which would at least buy time. These two pieces of good news seem to have steadied the ship for now, with markets recovering lost ground, although the day's widespread pessimism has not abated yet. A new problem is the Catalonian referendum, which is scheduled for 25 November. Spain\u2019s situation teeters on a knife-edge, as bond yields show, and while Greece might have bought itself more time that's a resource Spain seems to be running short of. It can't be long before Mariano Rajoy is forced to formally request help. And on that note it's time to shut up shop for the evening. We'll be back tomorrow to cover the European strikes and all the day's other developments. Over in Greece it\u2019s been another busy day on the industrial action front, reports our correspondent Helena Smith. While Greek politicians have been number crunching in Brussels, workers in Greece have been either taking to the streets or walking off the job. Earlier today hundreds of striking metal workers employed at shipyards in the port of Pireaus angrily marched through Athens before protesting en masse outside the finance ministry in Syntagma square. \u201cWe want work. We don\u2019t want to be unemployed. Hands of shipyards,\u201d they chanted. \u201cThe yards have been completely abandoned by the state. Most of us haven\u2019t been paid for the past seven months,\u201d said Yiannis Stefanopoulos who as head of the Panhellenic Metalworkers Federation (POEM) was leading the protest march. \u201cThis is having a tragic effect with entire families literally being torn apart.\u201d Ahead of tomorrow\u2019s pan-European general strike in protest over austerity measures, civil servants also staged a three-hour work stoppage. \u201cWe will stage another one tomorrow along with private sector workers,\u201d said Tania Karayiannis at ADEDY, the union that represents public sector employees. \u201cAll over Europe people are being forced by national governments and the EU to suffer the most extreme neoliberal policies under the pretext of solving this crisis,\u201d she said. \u201cAll these policies are unfair but today we focused on protesting against lay-offs in the public sector outside the administrative reform ministry.\u201d UK prime minister David Cameron has said he would be writing to EC president Van Rompuy suggesting a \"single market council\", and also said Britain would support banking union \"as long as we can achieve the safeguards we need.\" At a press conference in Rome he told Italian prime minister Mario Monti their two countries were both large contributors to the EU and financial control was needed. Monti had said the two countries were not in perfect agreement on the EU budget. Meanwhile David Cameron is meeting Italian prime minister Mario Monti in Rome: French president Fran\u00e7ois Hollande has said Greece deserves Europe's aid, in a press conference taking place at the moment (link here). He also said France must undertake reforms to bring down public spending. Germany's finance minister Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble has added fuel to the fire of a possible bumper \u20ac44bn aid payment to Greece. According to Reuters snaps, he said paying out three tranches of aid in one go was part of the discussions. But, and here's the but, it needed control mechanisms for it to be paid out. Greek finance minister Yannis Stournaras has said that recapitalising the country's banks is not enough to lift their liquidity levels to where they need to be. Speaking in Brussels he has called for money taken out of Greece to be repatriated. He reckoned around a third of deposits which fled the country have now returned. He has added: It's not just shares and currencies which have reacted badly to the lack of any resolution to the eurozone crisis. The cost of insuring sovereign debt against default for key eurozone countries has jumped sharply this month. Joe Rundle, head of trading at ETX Capital, said: The troika holding fire on unlocking the next tranche of funds for Greece has not only pushed the euro below the 1.27 level this week, but credit default swaps for peripheral euro zone countries are on the rise. Spain\u2019s CDS shot up 32% on the month, while Italian CDS are up around 35% for the same period. Worryingly, French CDS are up a staggering 42% on the month while German CDS are up 33%, indicating the pressure is being felt more by the core nations over the peripheral. Although all mentioned CDS are not at levels reached during the summer and still a considerable way off, this recent rise threatens to undo the rally triggered by the ECB\u2019s OMT backstop announced in September which aims to assist struggling nations who need financial support. As long as the troika squabble over Greece\u2019s next trance of funds, we can expect continued pressure on CDS levels which could reach the highs of the summer of 2012 if no solution to Greece\u2019s future and the US fiscal cliff can be found. Spain's economy minister Luis de Guindos has told reporters in Brussels there is no current proposal to renegotiate the country's deficit targets. He has also reportedly put much of the blame on Greece for Spain's high borrowing costs: Meanwhile, speaking in London, IMF deputy managing director David Lipton has praised Ireland and Portugal for complying well with their IMF programmes although they still face problems. Indeed, earlier the Bank of Portugal cut its forecast for GDP in 2013 from no growth to a fall of 1.6%. It added that the projection was highly uncertain. It kept its forecast of a 3% fall in GDP for the current year, in line with the government's estimate. However it has become more pessimistic about next year than the government, which expects a 1% contraction. There are suggestions that Germany's vote on the Greek bailout will now not happen before the Eurogroup meeting next week, which of course will add another delay to the already tortuous process. Over in Greece, the government appears to be expressing optimism over the outcome of the Eurogroup meeting ahead of a renewed push in Brussels by prime minister Antonis Samaras. Our correspondent Helena Smith writes: With the Greek prime minister Antonis Samaras poised to hold talks with European Commission president Jose Manuel Barroso in Brussels, officials in Athens are in upbeat mood. Aides say the conservative leader will impress upon Barroso for rescue funds to be released as soon as possible saying \u201cwith the budget vote Greece has done its bit, now it is up to Europe to do the same.\u201d The Greek finance minister Yiannis Stournaras, who is in Brussels, says despite disagreement between the EU and IMF over how to resolve Greece\u2019s debt sustainability, disbursement of the long-delayed \u20ac31.5bn aid package is now a \u201cdone deal.\u201d The technocrat said he believed the entire amount would be \u201cdeposited in an account at the Bank of Greece by the end of November or early December\u201d once individual member state parliaments had voted on the package. After months of nail-biting negotiations over biting austerity measures and other structural reforms demanded by the country\u2019s \u201ctroika\u201d of creditors at the EU, ECB and IMF, officials described the mood between Athens and its lenders \u201cas discernibly different. We are very pleased with the troika report which really is a landmark in raising our country\u2019s credibility abroad,\u201d said one insider. Sournaras, like Samaras, has cautioned however that the hard work begins now with implementation of the accord. \u201cThis is a government that will not know Sundays or holidays,\u201d said Samaras. The focus is on Greece at the moment but that shouldn't conceal the fact that the problems are much more widespread. That's the view of Steen Jakobsen, chief economist at Saxo, who said: I remain of the opinion that Greece will \u201cbreak from the euro\u201d \u2013 but in an orderly fashion, meaning with consent of EU and with its support. Greece is no longer the real issue in Europe \u2013 where Spain is now where Greece was two-three years ago - a negative growth spiral with no voter support. The Catalonian election on 23 November could escalate Spain\u2019s issues and hence also the Greek situation. So far in this crisis we have dealt with countries one-by-one. First Greece and Ireland, then Portugal then Spain/Italy, then back to Greece, then Spain, but now\u2026 Spain is on the edge, Greece is hanging onto the edge and Europe outlook for growth and political resolve is further away than before. Greece could become the \u201csacrifice\u201d needed to get European reforms back on track. The euro just jumped by half a cent against the US dollar, erasing this morning's losses, on the back of a (rather curious) report that the German government is considering a plan to give Greece a \u20ac44bn aid payment. Bild, the German tabloid, is claiming that Berlin wants to bundle three aid tranches (including the long-delayed \u20ac31.5bn payment) into a single one. Asked about it, a German government spokeswoman said that 'no final decision' has yet been taken about Greece's aid. Which isn't exactly a denial. Financial experts aren't immediately sure what to make of the report, but one theory is that the figure includes the 'profits' the European Central Bank has made by buying Greek debt at distressed levels since the crisis began: Developing.... (and on that note, I have to dash to a meeting so my colleague Nick Fletcher has the controls...). Cheers, GW Some quotes from Jean-Claude Juncker just hit the wires. The Eurogroup chair has attempted to calm the situation after last night's public spat with Christine Lagarde, insisting that there is 'no real dispute' between Europe and the International Monetary Fund. Juncker added that he was 'confident' that the IMF would remain as a member of the Greek aid programme. An attempt to calm fears that policymakers are at each other's throats? If so, more reassurance may be needed.... EU finance ministers have gathered in Brussels for today's Ecofin meeting, and here are a couple of snaps: The meeting is expected to focus on methods to boost the slumping economy, and the sticky issue of the EU budget. And speaking of Sch\u00e4uble, our Ian Traynor points out that the German finance minister could soon be sharing a job with France's Pierre Moscovici (with whom he sat side-by-side physically and metaphorically this morning) Sch\u00e4uble and Moscovici are being touted for a jobshare in the new year - taking turns to chair the Eurogroup of finance ministers if and when Jean-Claude Juncker of Luxembourg steps down. Both men nimbly sidestepped the question from the French and German media (no questions were granted to non-French, non-German media), and a few months back they also announced the creation of a high-level joint Franco-German working group on economic policy and fortnightly sessions of the two ministers. Nothing much seems to have come of that, though. Back to Brussels, where German officials are \u2013 perhaps for domestic political reasons \u2013 denying that the Greek bailout terms are being extended by two years to 2016. Ian Traynor reports: \u201cYou\u2019re extending the fiscal targets for Greece, you\u2019re not extending the programme, \u20ac32bn is not being looked at,\u201d insisted a German finance ministry official. \u201cThe programme ends in 2014.\u201d That \u20ac32bn figure has come from the Troika's draft report into Greece, and is its rough estimate of the cost of giving Greece until 2016 to hit its debt reduction targets. So.... that 'open issue' will be discussed by the Eurogroup next week (at the 20 November meeting agreed last night) On debt sustainability, the official confirmed the dispute which flared into the open on Monday evening, with Christine Lagarde, the IMF chief, and Jean-Claude Juncker, chair of the eurogroup, publicly contradicting one another.\u2028 \u201cYou need agreement in the troika and there isn\u2019t any,\u201d said the official. Or as the FT's Alan Beattie puts it: It\u2019s not as if the troika of eurozone rescue lenders never falls out, but usually it takes a not-in-front-of-the-children attitude to airing its rows. More here. Just in: Greece has announced that is has raised just over \u20ac4bn through its sale of short-term debt. That leaves it around \u20ac1bn short of the \u20ac5bn bond which matures at the end of the week. However, I think the auction is arguably a success -- Greece can raise more money through \"non-competitive bids\" (ie, selling more bonds at the prices set in today's sale). Originally Athens had aimed to raise \u20ac3.2bn in today's sale of short-term debt. So experts aren't panicking: Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble, Germany's finance minister, has emphatically denied that France's economy is in serious trouble, at a press conference with French counterpart Pierre Moscovici in Brussels this morning. Our Europe editor Ian Traynor was there, and reports: Amid mounting worries in Berlin that the real elephant in the eurozone room is the unreformed France of Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, both countries\u2019 finance ministers have just attempted a show of unity in the basement of the European Council building in Brussels. Asked by French TV whether France was now the \u201csick man of Europe\u201d, Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble quickly and emphatically declared: \u201cNo, and you must not waste a second in answering that.\u201d The air was thick with pledges from both Sch\u00e4uble and Moscovici that Paris and Berlin stand \u201cside by side\u201d, sharing a \u201ccommon vision\u201d and a \u201ccommon mission\u201d for Europe. But the unusual joint appearance before the press following last night\u2019s failure to deliver on Greece might prove counter-productive, suggesting that both men had to perform together to try to dispel the frictions between both sides of the Rhine. The impression from the joint appearance was that both men rather protest too much that everything is dandy in the Franco-German relationship. On Greece, the now public differences between the Europeans and the IMF on Greek debt sustainability, and how to fill a two-year funding gap in the bailout put at more than \u20ac32bn euros, Sch\u00e4uble said that the IMF\u2019s 2020 target for Greek debt sustainability was \u201cperhaps too ambitious\u201d. He pooh-poohed all notions of writing down Greece\u2019s debt to its official lenders, effectively conceding that he would not be able to get such a move through the Bundestag in Berlin. You can watch last night's Eurogroup press conference in the video clip above (although you may find that it 'hangs' if you attempt to scroll forwards and backwards) Economic sentiment in Germany has dropped this month, showing that Europe's biggest economy continues to feel the chill from the euro crisis. The ZEW survey came in at -15.7, worse than October's -11.5, showing that German economists are more alarmed about Germany's economy. ZEW blamed \"recessionary developments\" in the eurozone, which are expected to curtail German economic growth in the next six months. Economists surveyed were their most pessimistic about the current situation since the summer of 2010. The news knocked the euro to a new two-month low against the US of $1.26615.... ...even though some City analysts question whether the ZEW survey is a particularly helpful measure.... UK inflation jumped sharply last month as food, transport and university fees drove up the cost of living. The Consumer Prices Index rose to 2.7% for October, up from 2.2% in September. That's a much bigger rise than economists had expected, and dampens hopes that UK inflation was finally dropping back to the Bank of England's target of 2%. City experts are not impressed! City experts are pretty gloomy about the crisis this morning \u2013 here's a selection of the latest comments: Marc Ostwald of Monument Securities: As we have argued for a very long time, the Greek debt situation will always be unsustainable until its existing pile of debt is written down or off to below 80% of GDP, and this will have primarily to involve public sector holdings. There are no other solutions ... other than outright default. Elisabeth Afseth of Evolution Securities Perhaps European finance ministers may not ever agree not to release the funds, just keeping on not agreeing to release them, there is something a bit \u2018Yes, Minister\u2019 about it all.... Officials insisted Greece will be able to raise t-bills to cover redemptions due at the end of this week and thus avoiding another default, it can\u2019t go on forever though, regardless of how much European politicians enjoy making up new \u2018Yes, Minister\u2019 episodes. Gary Jenkins of Swordfish Research Ms Lagarde and Mr Juncker openly disagreed about the timetable to reduce Greece\u2019s debt / GDP to 120%. The former wants that target achieved by 2020, as initially agreed, whilst the latter would like to extend it to 2022, which sounds a bit like a conversation which might have been had at the Mad Tea Party from Alice in Wonderland. Unless Greece enjoys an economic miracle or its creditors are prepared to incur losses then it doesn\u2019t really matter if you say 2020, 2022 or 2025, the most likely outcome is that Greece won\u2019t get anywhere near that target. Ms Lagarde would appear to be in favour of an Official Sector Involvement program as she said that Greece needs a \u201creal fix, not a quick fix.\u201d Lee McDarby of Investec Corporate Treasury: Yesterday\u2019s Eurogroup meeting has done little to buoy market sentiment towards the shared currency. Michael Hewson of CMC Markets The issue of the \u20ac5bn Greece Friday loan repayment to the ECB was brushed aside last night, with Olli Rehn saying that he remained sure that Greek banks had enough available collateral to cover today\u2019s Greece t-bill auction. Given that the success of this auction could dictate whether or not the ECB has to adjust its collateral rules Greek officials will be hoping that the auction is fully covered, and that they can then make the relevant payment on Friday. A quick reminder of what's coming up today \u2022 Ecofin meeting in Brussels: all day \u2022 UK inflation data for October: 9.30am GMT \u2022 German ZEW Survey of economic sentiment: 10am GMT / 11am CET \u2022 Greek \u20ac5bn bond sale: morning \u2022 Charles Dallara, head of the Institute of International Finance, visits Greece: all day \u2022 David Cameron visiting Mario Monti: this afternoon Sony Kapoor of the Redefine thinktank has given a cautious welcome to the eurogroup's decision to extend Greece's fiscal programme to 2016 Europe's failure to make more progress last night has hit stock markets this morning, with the major indices dropping in early trading. FTSE 100: down 43 points at 5723, -0.75% German DAX: down 44 points at 7124. -0.6% French CAC: down 18 points at 3393, - 0.5% Spanish IBEX: down 64 points at 7503, - 0.83% Italian FTSE MIB: down 126 points at 14996, -0.8% Most Asian markets lost ground overnight, with the Hong Kong Hang Seng dropping more than 1%. Mike McCudden, head of derivatives at stockbroker Interactive Investor, said traders remained alarmed by the Greek situation: Euro zone ministers failed to agree last night on the next loan tranche for Greece, pushing it even closer to a default. This delay shouldn't necessarily surprise investors as they await the Troika's report, but pushing them this close to the edge will leave many spooked. Heads-up: the finance ministers of Germany and France are due to give a press conference shortly in Brussels, before the main Ecofin meeting (involving ministers from all 27 EU nations) gets under way. The eurozone crisis has hit mobile phone giant Vodafone hard. The company reported this morning that it is taking a \u00a35.9bn impairment charge on its Spanish and Italian operations. It blamed \"challenging market conditions\" and \"macroeconomic pressures\" \u2013 with both countries deep in recession. Vodafone's financial results appear to show the impact of austerity in the eurozone periphery \u2013 service revenues across southern Europe are down by 9.8% in the six months to the end of September. The company said it was suffering from \"margin erosion\" in Italy, Greece and Portugal \u2013 suggesting that people are simply giving up their handsets. The news has disappointed the City: Here's how last night's Eurogroup meeting, and the row between Lagarde and Juncker, is being covered this morning: Financial Times: EU-IMF feud erupts over Greek debt (\u00a3) Eurozone finance ministers last night postponed agreement on Greece\u2019s long-delayed \u20ac31.3bn aid payment for yet another week as divisions between the International Monetary Fund and EU creditors over how fast Athens must reduce its burgeoning debt levels burst into the open. Christine Lagarde, the IMF chief, and Jean-Claude Juncker, chair of the eurogroup of finance ministers, publicly sparred over whether Greece must reduce its debt levels to 120 per cent of economic output by 2020, long viewed the target to get Athens back to a sustainable debt level. Daily Telegraph: IMF chief and EU clash over Greek debt A conflict between the International Monetary Fund and European Union erupted into the open on Monday night after Christine Lagarde publicly clashed with eurozone finance ministers over a critical target for reducing Greek debt levels. Reuters: Greece wins more time but no immediate aid Greece's international lenders agreed on Monday to give the country two more years to make the cuts demanded of it but the euro zone and IMF clashed over a longer-term target date to shrink the country's debt pile. Euro zone finance ministers gathered in Brussels did not disburse more aid to the debt-ridden country and by granting a request from Athens for more time, face an extra funding bill of around 33 billion euros (26.4 billion pounds), according to a document prepared for the meeting. Wall Street Journal: Lenders at Odds Over Greek Debt Differences among Greece's official lenders about how to reduce the country's debt to manageable levels spilled into the open late Monday, as the head of the International Monetary Fund emphasized she opposed euro-zone efforts to avoid making significant debt concessions to Greece. The public show of disagreement after a meeting of euro-zone finance ministers meeting here\u2014following months of behind-the-scenes bickering over debt targets\u2014indicated that lenders have a lot of work to do to settle on how to release a long-delayed \u20ac31.5 billion ($40 billion) aid payment. The Eurogroup's failure to take a decision on Greece's aid payment last night has knocked the euro, which hit a new two-month low of $1.2671 against the US dollar in early trading. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the eurozone financial crisis, and other key events around the global economy, Greece has been granted two more years to hit its financial targets. The decision was made late last night in Brussels, at the meeting of eurozone finance ministers. However the question of whether to hand over its next bailout tranche (worth \u20ac31.5bn) has not been taken, with the Eurogroup delaying the decision by another week until 20 November. That indicates that eurozone officials and the International Monetary Fund remain divided over how to handle Greece (as we covered in yesterday's blog). In particular, how to close the funding gap of around \u20ac32bn created by giving Athens two years grace. The news came at a late-night press conference, at which IMF MD Christine Lagarde and Eurogroup president Jean-Claude Juncker had a dramatic public spat. The brinkmanship between the IMF and the EU burst into open warfare, after Juncker declared that the deadline for Greece to bring its national debt down to 120% of GDP had been moved by two years, to 2022. Lagarde denied that this was the case, prompting Juncker to reiterate it and tell reporters that: I\u2019m not joking. Cue head-shaking and eye-rolling from Lagarde, who hit back, saying: In our view, the appropriate timetable is 120 per cent by 2020...We clearly have different views. We've known for weeks that the IMF and the EU were split over how, and how quickly, to bring Greece's debt into line \"burst into the open\". But members of the press pack were still stunned to see the argument vented in public: So what can we look forward to today? Negotiations will continue in Brussels, where all 27 finance ministers from the EU are meeting. We'll be tracking all the action from there, and reaction to last night's deal. We also have UK inflation data released this morning, a Greek debt auction (crucial if it is to repay the \u20ac5bn loan that matures later this week), and the visit of David Cameron to Rome to meet Mario Monti. Should be lively....",

    "webTitle": "Gas prices: FSA examines whistleblower's claims of 'Libor-like' manipulation", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "UPDATE: on 7 November 2013 Ofgem and FCA concluded their investigation and found that there had been no market manipulation: http://www.fca.org.uk/news/statements/statement-gas-market-manipulation The City watchdog, the Financial Services Authority, is investigating claims by a whistleblower that Britain's \u00a3300bn wholesale gas market has been \"regularly\" manipulated by some of the big power companies, exploiting weaknesses that echo the recent Libor scandal. Separately, the energy regulator Ofgem has been warned by a company responsible for setting so-called benchmark prices, ICIS Heren, that it had seen evidence of suspect trading on 28 September, a key date as it marks the end of the gas financial year and can have an important influence on future prices. The whistleblower, who worked for ICIS Heren, raised the alarm after identifying what he believed to be attempts to distort the prices reported by the company. These benchmark prices are critically important because many wholesale gas contracts are based on them and small changes in the price can cost or save companies millions. The revelations come at a highly charged time for Britain's energy sector, with many of the big six suppliers under public fire for alleged profiteering on household energy bills and mis-selling on the doorstep. The energy secretary, Ed Davey, said : \"I am extremely concerned about these allegations and will be keeping in close touch with the regulators while they get to the bottom of this.\" In a statement, the FSA said: \"We can confirm that we have received information in relation to the physical gas market. We take market misconduct seriously and will be analysing the material.\" Ofgem said it had been given material \"relating to trading in the gas market and is looking into the issue\". The energy regulator said it had limited powers in this area but would \"consider carefully any evidence of market abuse brought to our attention as well as scope for action under all our other powers\". The City and energy regulators are keenly aware of the growing political concern that high energy prices, which are linked to wholesale values, can increase fuel poverty and undermine economic growth. , he Green MP Caroline Lucas said: \"If these revelations stand up to analysis by the FSA and Ofgem, then this is corruption on a massive scale and a shameful case of corporates coming together to exploit a public utility.\" The market abuse concerns were initially raised by Seth Freedman, a former City trader who worked as a price reporter at ICIS Heren for nine months. He told the Guardian he believed problems he spotted in a frenzied half-hour of trading on 28 September were more widespread. \"Traders have made clear to me that manipulation of gas prices is taking place on a regular basis. \"They name big companies among those they accuse of trying to rig prices and reap profits. Market participants claim the fixing of prices is an open secret,\" he said. He also claimed that: \u2022 The big six companies are among those whose names are quoted by traders as being involved in attempts to raise or depress wholesale gas prices. \u2022 The key benchmark indices produced by at least one price reporting agency (PRA) and used increasingly in massive UK supply contracts are unreliable, and undermined by poorly-trained staff and over-cosy relationships between traders and price reporters. \u2022 Traders regularly put price reporters under pressure to change prices they disagree with. \u2022 Price reporters struggle to set accurate benchmarks because they lack detailed information about trading in the opaque so-called \"over-the-counter\" market and are dependent on what traders tell them about market activity. The disturbing issues raised by the traders he spoke to daily in his job at ICIS led Freedman to tape conversations about the 28 September price gyrations, which he has handed over to the FSA. In one, a trader from one power firm says: \"There's a feeling among some people that somebody's taking the piss a bit on the day-ahead index. Between us I think [Company X] got in a bit of trouble for that about six months ago.\" It has not been possible to establish if any company was censured. Another trader told Freedman, who has previously been a freelance contributor to the Guardian, in an instant messaging exchange: \"There are a few shops that continually try to distort closes from what I see \u2026 some of the range of quotes I hear sometimes are criminal.\" When Freedman flagged up a series of suspiciously low trades that he believed were designed to depress ICIS's \"day-ahead\" price on 28 September, a senior ICIS manager acknowledged they appeared to be an attempt to manipulate the price but said \"actually we did a bad job investigating it\". ICIS Heren did notify Ofgem about the suspicious trades. But, in another recorded conversation, the manager said there was \"no official thing to do\" when PRAs saw what they believed to be evidence of price manipulation. The whistleblower's information, handed over to the FSA, shows that on 28 September the price at which so-called day-ahead gas contracts were being bought and sold dropped sharply at precisely the time \u2013 4.30pm \u2013 at which ICIS Heren attempts to take the pulse of the market. One explanation for this could be that traders were deliberately dealing below the prevailing price in order to drag the benchmark down, perhaps because they stood to gain more from other contracts linked to this benchmark. It is not possible for price reporters to establish who did the suspicious deals as they were conducted through a third-party brokerage firm. In a statement, ICIS confirmed that it had detected some \"unusual trading\" activity on the British wholesale gas market on 28 September, which it reported to energy regulator Ofgem in October. \"The cause of the trading pattern, which involved a series of deals done below the prevailing market trend, has not yet been established. ICIS welcomes the seriousness with which the regulator has so far responded to this information and we have provided all the evidence at our disposal to help determine what happened.\" ICIS said it welcomed the additional powers that are to be assigned to national energy regulators as of next year under the EU's regulation on energy market integrity and transparency (Remit), and the additional market oversight provided by the pan-European energy regulator ACER. A spokesman for the Department of Energy and Climate Change said: \"The government takes alleged abuse in our markets very seriously. It's important not to pre-empt the work that the enforcement agencies already have under way to assess the detail of the allegations made. The FSA and Ofgem have a range of powers available to them and have our full support in applying the law and ensuring that any wrongdoers are held to account.\" It is understood Davey, will make a statement to the Commons on Tuesday about the price manipulation allegations. In Europe, energy firms have been trying to fight off attempts by Brussels to introduce tighter regulation of the gas market which would ensure there can be no repeat of the Libor scandal \u2013 where banks manipulated the rates at which they borrowed money. Arlene McCarthy, the North West England MEP, said she feared Freedman had unearthed another case of apparent market abuse and manipulation in gas prices. \"For some time I have feared there is an extensive cartel culture of market-rigging and price-fixing in the commodities markets. \"Companies guilty of abuse must face the full force of penalties and sanctions and jail for criminal behaviour,\" she said. \"The FSA must take action but as the UK gas is the benchmark for gas traded at EU level I will be asking European commissioners [Joaqu\u00edn] Almunia and [Michel] Barnier to take urgent action on cartels and price-fixing and introduce tough rules on the setting of benchmarks and indices in the commodities markets.\" Chris Cook, a former compliance officer at the International Petroleum Exchange and now a senior research fellow at University College, London, said the problems highlighted by Freedman in the gas market echoed those in the oil sector. \"There is a structural issue here that over-the-counter markets with low liquidity can be manipulated by traders putting through visible trades at a duff price. We need to make sure the market is more transparent through a transaction registry,\" Cook said. The way energy prices, which are used for key benchmarks in much larger multibillion-pound supply contracts, are formulated has been under scrutiny from the G20 group of leading global economies. The PRAs' (PRAs) work in the oil markets was scrutinised by an organisation working for the G20 nations amid widespread concern about oil trader speculation. There is no suggestion that ICIS or any other PRA has been involved in speculation themselves, but there are fears their reporting could be distorted by misleading information provided by energy traders, or by anomalously priced trades designed to move the benchmark price. A report published last month by the board of the International Organisation of Securities Commissions (IOSCO) talks about the \"opacity and variations\" in PRA assessment methodologies. \"The need for assessors to use judgment under methodologies creates an opportunity for the submitter of data deliberately to bias a PRA's assessment in order to benefit the submitter's derivatives position,\" it says, adding: \"For example, a trader seeking to manipulate a price might attempt to influence the personnel responsible for assessment.\" The French oil group Total said in a letter to the IOSCO: \"Sometimes the criteria imposed by PRAs do not assure an accurate representation of the market and consequently deform the real price levels paid at every level of the price chain, including by the consumer.\" Meanwhile, energy companies have been working hard to fight off any new initiatives from Brussels about the way gas prices are set. A European gas hub report just published by ICIS says: \"The recent London interbank offered rate (Libor) scandal engulfing major financial institutions also prompted a European commission consultation in early September on the regulation of key indices, including those for coal, natural gas and electricity. However, strong industry resistance to many of the proposals has so far resulted in the watering down of many elements of the current regulatory proposals.\" In the past, because there were relatively few \"spot\" short-term contracts to give ideas about current prices, these British and other European longer-term import deals with the Norwegians or the Russians were tied to prevailing oil prices. But increasingly major long-term and high-volume contracts have been linked to spot prices set by ICIS and other agencies. Although some deals with corporate customers are specifically linked to benchmark prices such as ICIS Heren's, industry experts say it is difficult to assess what impact wholesale manipulation \u2013 if it were going on \u2013 would have on household bills. EDF and SSE, two of the big six, contacted by the Guardian, denied that they would be involved in any attempt to manipulate prices or be involved in other bad practice. Two others, E.ON and RWE, have made similar statements in the past. A spokesman for the French-based energy group said: \"EDF Energy does not participate in loss-leading trading activity and considers it to be against existing market regulation. We make information likely to impact market price formation publicly available on our website in compliance with Remit.\" SSE said: \"We are entirely confident that our energy portfolio management team operate in a fair and legitimate way.\" A spokesman for British Gas owner Centrica, said: \"Our compliance procedures and trading principles are clear. They require us to comply with all EU and UK laws and we have done so.\" A spokesman for Scottish Power said: \"Scottish Power has never engaged in trying to fix wholesale gas trading markets. Our trading division always acts with integrity and follows all rules in all of its engagements with the market.\" The political temperature over domestic energy bills is likely to hot up again when a British Gas price rise of 6% for gas and electricity comes into effect on Friday. The average household bill for a dual-fuel British Gas customer will go up from \u00a31,260 to \u00a31,336 a year, according to the energy account transfer service uSwitch. Ann Robinson, director of consumer policy at uSwitch.com, said (Mon 12): \"The timing could not be worse \u2013 as winter makes its presence known, the cost of heating our homes will be taking its toll on cash-strapped consumers. With bills reaching an all-time high, it's no surprise that almost nine in 10 households will be rationing their energy usage this winter.\" McCarthy, the MEP, said any upheaval in the wholesale markets was dangerous because domestic supply companies cited the rise in wholesale prices as a reason for household prices to increase. \"If in the end wholesale prices are being manipulated to increase the profits of the energy companies then consumers will end up the victim of this great gas ripoff. Families have seen gas and energy prices rise on average by between six and 9% this year, adding on average \u00a3200 to their bills.\" Freedman has worked as an FSA-approved trader in the City and contributed to the Guardian from Israel. He was not working for the Guardian while employed as a price reporter by ICIS Heren. \u2022 Do you or have you worked in the gas market? Can you help us with this story?

These benchmark prices are critically important because many wholesale gas contracts are based on them and small changes in the price can cost or save companies millions.</p> <p>The revelations come at a highly charged time for Britain's energy sector, with many of the big six suppliers under public fire for alleged profiteering on household energy bills and mis-selling on the doorstep.</p> <p>The energy secretary, Ed Davey, said : \"I am extremely concerned about these allegations and will be keeping in close touch with the regulators while they get to the bottom of this.\"</p> <p>In a statement, the FSA said: \"We can confirm that we have received information in relation to the physical gas market. We take market misconduct seriously and will be analysing the material.\"</p> <p>Ofgem said it had been given material \"relating to trading in the gas market and is looking into the issue\". The energy regulator said it had limited powers in this area but would \"consider carefully any evidence of market abuse brought to our attention as well as scope for action under all our other powers\".</p> <p>The City and energy regulators are keenly aware of the growing political concern that high energy prices, which are linked to wholesale values, can increase fuel poverty and undermine economic growth. , he Green MP Caroline Lucas said: \"If these revelations stand up to analysis by the FSA and Ofgem, then this is corruption on a massive scale and a shameful case of corporates coming together to exploit a public utility.\"</p> <p>The market abuse concerns were initially raised by Seth Freedman, a former City trader who worked as a price reporter at ICIS Heren for nine months. He told the Guardian he believed problems he spotted in a frenzied half-hour of trading on 28 September were more widespread.</p> <p>\"Traders have made clear to me that manipulation of gas prices is taking place on a regular basis.</p> <p>\"They name big companies among those they accuse of trying to rig prices and reap profits. Market participants claim the fixing of prices is an open secret,\" he said.</p> <p>He also claimed that:</p> <p>\u2022 The big six companies are among those whose names are quoted by traders as being involved in attempts to raise or depress wholesale gas prices.</p> <p>\u2022 The key benchmark indices produced by at least one price reporting agency (PRA) and used increasingly in massive UK supply contracts are unreliable, and undermined by poorly-trained staff and over-cosy relationships between traders and price reporters.</p> <p>\u2022 Traders regularly put price reporters under pressure to change prices they disagree with.</p> <p>\u2022 Price reporters struggle to set accurate benchmarks because they lack detailed information about trading in the opaque so-called \"over-the-counter\" market and are dependent on what traders tell them about market activity.</p>      <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-398684192\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2012/11/9/1352495346786/Yeah-its-just-sometimes-004.jpg\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/brightcove/2012/11/11/121101statoil-16x9.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2012/11/14/121101statoil_3gpLg16x9.3gp\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2012/11/14/121101statoil_3gpSml16x9.3gp\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/ad/121101statoil/121101statoil.m3u8\"/> </video>   <p>The disturbing issues raised by the traders he spoke to daily in his job at ICIS led Freedman to tape conversations about the 28 September price gyrations, which he has handed over to the FSA.</p> <p>In one, a trader from one power firm says: \"There's a feeling among some people that somebody's taking the piss a bit on the day-ahead index.

But, in another recorded conversation, the manager said there was \"no official thing to do\" when PRAs saw what they believed to be evidence of price manipulation.</p> <p>The whistleblower's information, handed over to the FSA, shows that on 28 September the price at which so-called day-ahead gas contracts were being bought and sold dropped sharply at precisely the time \u2013 4.30pm \u2013 at which ICIS Heren attempts to take the pulse of the market.</p> <p>One explanation for this could be that traders were deliberately dealing below the prevailing price in order to drag the benchmark down, perhaps because they stood to gain more from other contracts linked to this benchmark.</p> <p>It is not possible for price reporters to establish who did the suspicious deals as they were conducted through a third-party brokerage firm.</p> <p>In a statement, ICIS confirmed that it had detected some \"unusual trading\" activity on the British wholesale gas market on 28 September, which it reported to energy regulator Ofgem in October.</p> <p>\"The cause of the trading pattern, which involved a series of deals done below the prevailing market trend, has not yet been established. ICIS welcomes the seriousness with which the regulator has so far responded to this information and we have provided all the evidence at our disposal to help determine what happened.\"</p> <p>ICIS said it welcomed the additional powers that are to be assigned to national energy regulators as of next year under the EU's regulation on energy market integrity and transparency (Remit), and the additional market oversight provided by the pan-European energy regulator ACER.</p> <p>A spokesman for the Department of Energy and Climate Change said: \"The government takes alleged abuse in our markets very seriously. It's important not to pre-empt the work that the enforcement agencies already have under way to assess the detail of the allegations made. The FSA and Ofgem have a range of powers available to them and have our full support in applying the law and ensuring that any wrongdoers are held to account.\"</p> <p>It is understood Davey, will make a statement to the Commons on Tuesday about the price manipulation allegations.</p> <p>In Europe, energy firms have been trying to fight off attempts by Brussels to introduce tighter regulation of the gas market which would ensure there can be no repeat of the Libor scandal \u2013 where banks manipulated the rates at which they borrowed money.</p> <p>Arlene McCarthy, the North West England MEP, said she feared Freedman had unearthed another case of apparent market abuse and manipulation in gas prices. \"For some time I have feared there is an extensive cartel culture of market-rigging and price-fixing in the commodities markets.</p> <p>\"Companies guilty of abuse must face the full force of penalties and sanctions and jail for criminal behaviour,\" she said.</p> <p>\"The FSA must take action but as the UK gas is the benchmark for gas traded at EU level I will be asking European commissioners [Joaqu\u00edn] Almunia and [Michel] Barnier to take urgent action on cartels and price-fixing and introduce tough rules on the setting of benchmarks and indices in the commodities markets.\"</p> <p>Chris Cook, a former compliance officer at the International Petroleum Exchange and now a senior research fellow at University College, London, said the problems highlighted by Freedman in the gas market echoed those in the oil sector.</p> <p>\"There is a structural issue here that over-the-counter markets with low liquidity can be manipulated by traders putting through visible trades at a duff price. We need to make sure the market is more transparent through a transaction registry,\" Cook said.</p> <p>The way energy prices, which are used for key benchmarks in much larger multibillion-pound supply contracts, are formulated has been under scrutiny from the G20 group of leading global economies.</p> <p>The PRAs' (PRAs) work in the oil markets was scrutinised by an organisation working for the G20 nations amid widespread concern about oil trader speculation. There is no suggestion that ICIS or any other PRA has been involved in speculation themselves, but there are fears their reporting could be distorted by misleading information provided by energy traders, or by anomalously priced trades designed to move the benchmark price.</p> <p>A report published last month by the board of the International Organisation of Securities Commissions (IOSCO) talks about the \"opacity and variations\" in PRA assessment methodologies.</p> <p>\"The need for assessors to use judgment under methodologies creates an opportunity for the submitter of data deliberately to bias a PRA's assessment in order to benefit the submitter's derivatives position,\" it says, adding: \"For example, a trader seeking to manipulate a price might attempt to influence the personnel responsible for assessment.\"</p> <p>The French oil group Total said in a letter to the IOSCO: \"Sometimes the criteria imposed by PRAs do not assure an accurate representation of the market and consequently deform the real price levels paid at every level of the price chain, including by the consumer.\"</p> <p>Meanwhile, energy companies have been working hard to fight off any new initiatives from Brussels about the way gas prices are set.</p> <p>A European gas hub report just published by ICIS says: \"The recent London interbank offered rate (Libor) scandal engulfing major financial institutions also prompted a European commission consultation in early September on the regulation of key indices, including those for coal, natural gas and electricity.
