      "bodyText": "British consumers have recovered some of their swagger after a run of better than expected economic figures calmed nerves following the Brexit vote. A leading poll of consumers found that a panic in the aftermath of the EU referendum, causing the biggest fall in confidence for 21 years, was partially reversed in August. Official figures showing strong high street sales in July and an increase in employment, coupled with a soaring stock market, helped bolster the outlook for the coming year, according to the GfK consumer confidence index. A package of measures announced by the Bank of England earlier this month, including an interest rate cut to 0.25%, was widely seen as an important safety net for households and businesses, offsetting warnings of an impending recession and rising joblessness. The GfK index climbed to -7.5, after slumping to -9.2 in July from -1.2 in June ahead of the referendum. Joe Staton, a spokesman for GfK, said consumers had settled into a new \u201cwait and see reality of a post-Brexit [vote], pre-exit UK\u201d. \u201cThe uptick in confidence is driven by good news from hard data, the combination of historic low interest rates matched with falling prices and high levels of employment,\u201d he said. Consumers said the outlook for the economy and their personal finances had improved, the survey reported. Staton said it was significant that the major purchase index, which monitors the demand for cars and other expensive items, had leapt by nine points to +7, while the savings index fell by 16 points. \u201cWe Brits are clearly determined to carry on shopping for today, rather than saving for tomorrow,\u201d he said. However, consumers remain nervous about the future, according to Bank data released on Tuesday, which showed a slowdown after previously strong growth in borrowing on credit cards and bank loans. Net consumer credit went up by \u00a31.2bn in July, according to the Bank, the smallest increase since August 2015 and well below analysts\u2019 expectations of a rise of \u00a31.7bn. The rate of consumer credit growth also slowed for the first time since December 2014, rising by 10.1% year on year in July, compared with year-on-year growth of 10.3% in June. Martin Beck, a senior economic adviser to the EY Item Club, said the long-term outlook for consumers was muted. \u201cAugust may see some recovery, in line with other economic indicators and aided by further declines in borrowing costs. But longer term, a less benign environment for consumers, reflecting a rise in unemployment and the squeeze on incomes from higher inflation, suggests that households\u2019 appetite to borrow will stay relatively subdued.\u201d Credit card lending was broadly unchanged in July, but personal loans almost halved from \u00a31.3bn to \u00a3700m, consistent with a slowdown in purchases of big-ticket items such as cars. Scott Bowman, a UK economist at consultancy Capital Economics, said the Bank lending figures showed that the Brexit vote had dented households\u2019 appetite for debt. \u201cThe latest figures suggest households\u2019 debt appetite has taken a bit of a hit post- referendum. But support from policymakers should prevent household borrowing from slowing too much,\u201d he said. The interest rate cut would prevent the UK economy from slipping into reverse, he said. \u201cAccordingly, we think consumer spending will ensure GDP growth falls to around zero in the second half of this year, rather than turning significantly negative.\u201d Announcing the rate cut, the Bank\u2019s governor, Mark Carney, said the economic outlook for Britain had changed markedly. But several economic indicators suggested that the UK economy has so far absorbed the shock of the referendum result. This month, the Office for National Statistics reported that retail sales volumes rose by 1.4% month on month and 5.9% year on year in July. The good economic news continued when the ONS said the jobless benefit claimant count fell by 8,600 to 763,600 in July. Last week, the CBI distributive trades survey, a monthly healthcheck for retailers and wholesalers, found that they had enjoyed their best month in August for half a year as shoppers bagged summer clothing bargains.",

      "bodyText": "Welcome to the baffling world of multinational corporate taxation. The European commission\u2019s ground-breaking ruling that Apple owes Ireland \u20ac13bn (\u00a311bn) in back-taxes after enjoying a quarter-century of illegal state-aid has exposed at least three oddities, or examples of plain old hypocrisy. First, there is the bizarre spectacle of the Irish government saying it would rather not have a cash windfall that would fund its health service for a year. Even after the years of austerity, Dublin would rather fight commissioner Margrethe Vestager\u2019s ruling. Second, US politicians are performing gymnastics. A US Senate committee in 2013 accused Apple of being \u201camong America\u2019s largest tax avoiders\u201d by exploiting Ireland\u2019s generous tax breaks. Yet, now that Vestager &amp; co have taken a shot at those same Irish inducements, the US political establishment is furious. Third, there is a mystery of why Brussels has taken so long to act. One of Apple\u2019s contentious deals with the Irish revenue authority dates to 1991, for heaven\u2019s sake. Or perhaps no detective work is required. Deals between multinational and tax authorities are officially confidential. In practice, that is merely a polite fiction to allow regulators and legislators to do nothing until public anger reaches boiling point. That is what has happened with taxation of multinationals. Vestager deserves congratulation for reading the mood. In the other corner, Tim Cook, Apple chief executive, takes the prize for misplaced indignation. His \u201cmessage to the Apple community in Europe\u201d was a masterclass in missing the bleedin\u2019 obvious. Cook grumbled about how the commission had \u201claunched an effort to rewrite Apple\u2019s history in Europe, ignore Ireland\u2019s tax laws and upend the international tax system in the process\u201d. He warned \u2013 or threatened \u2013 that jobs and investment in Europe would be at risk. Yet he failed to address the wider picture, or see the basic point that Apple has been paying so little tax in Europe that a confrontation was inevitable eventually. Yes, we all understand that the intellectual development takes place in California. But that does not equate to a licence to reduce the tax bill to tiny sums in territories in which the actual sales of products take place. Vestager had it right: \u201cIf my tax bill was 0.05%, falling to 0.005%, I would think I need to have a second look.\u201d Cook should indeed rethink. The tax system for multinationals is in a fine old mess, but a company like Apple ought to be able to recognise a few basic principles. Number one: forget the 1990s, or even the 2000s, and know when your tax-planning is just too aggressive for your customers\u2019 tastes. ARM and Britain\u2019s \u2018industrial strategy\u2019 A landslide was always on the cards. By a majority of 95%, the shareholders of ARM Holdings voted on Tuesday for their company to be sold to SoftBank of Japan for \u00a324bn, a price equivalent to 43% more than the old share price. The result was never in doubt. Less predictable, however, has been the lack of serious fuss elsewhere about a foreign takeover of the biggest and best technology company to have come out of the UK in the past 20 years. Chancellor Philip Hammond set the tone on day one with his silly comment that the deal showed that, after the UK\u2019s vote for Brexit, the country had lost \u201cnone of its allure to global investors\u201d. Nonsense. ARM, as a firm that sells and licenses its microchips around the globe, can afford to be indifferent about the UK\u2019s membership of the EU. The real Brexit angle was only this: SoftBank got its offer on the table before Theresa May\u2019s government could decide whether its commitment to \u201ca proper industrial strategy\u201d should mean bids like the one for ARM should undergo a national interest test. Hammond\u2019s lack of concern is more alarming the more one considers how little, apart from a pay-day for ARM shareholders, SoftBank brings to the table. The Japanese firm\u2019s promise to double the workforce in the UK over the next five years commits it doing only what ARM would almost certainly have achieved under its own steam. At least SoftBank founder and chief executive Masayoshi Son shares ARM\u2019s management\u2019s enthusiasm for the opportunities offered by the chip-heavy \u201cinternet of things,\u201d it could be argued. Yes, but it\u2019s hard to see why ownership from Japan is an improvement on a set-up that has served ARM well. As a highly successful public company, ARM has never struggled to get its investment plans approved by shareholders. SoftBank, by contrast, carries a mountain of debt, has no experience in the microchip business, and has competing claims on its capital, not least a US mobile telephone business facing stiff competition. \u201cA proper industrial strategy wouldn\u2019t automatically stop the sale of British firms to foreign ones, but it should be capable of stepping in to defend a sector that is as important as pharmaceuticals is to Britain,\u201d said May in her one and only speech in the campaign to win the Tory leadership. The reference was to Pfizer\u2019s failed tilt at AstaZeneca in 2014. Is the UK technology industry, with ARM at its head, different? Perhaps it is, but a UK government ought to be able to explain why.",

      "bodyText": "Record numbers of British tourists went to Spain this summer, undeterred by a weak pound and the vote for Brexit \u2013 with some resorts in Mallorca 100% booked up into late September. The attack on Istanbul airport in June, which left 41 dead, and other terror incidents in the eastern Mediterranean appear to have prompted many holidaymakers to go to Spain, in one of the biggest shifts in tourism patterns for years. Cuba and Bulgaria have also enjoyed big increases in tourist arrivals. Official Spanish government figures reveal that a record 9.6 million tourists arrived in July alone, up 11% on the year before, with about one in four coming from Britain. The Barcelona region has seen the biggest increase, followed by the Balearics, the Costa del Sol and the Canaries. Final figures for August have yet to be published, but the Association of British Travel Agents said it expects to see a year-on-year increase of 25% in numbers visiting Spain, but a 30% decline in Turkey, a 60% fall in Egypt and a near total collapse in Tunisia. It is estimated that terrorist attacks led to 4.6 million fewer tourists visiting Turkey, Egypt and Tunisia, with 2.2 million of those going to Spain instead. Rafael Gallego, the president of the Spanish travel agents and tour operators association, said: \u201cBetween 12% and 15% of the tourists coming to Spain wouldn\u2019t have come were it not that those destinations that compete directly with Spain for sun and beaches are closed due to tragic events.\u201d But some residents fear that parts of the country have hit \u201csaturation point\u201d with arrivals of 67 million tourists this year far outnumbering Spain\u2019s population of 47 million. On the streets of Mallorca\u2019s capital, Palma, scores of anti-tourist graffiti slogans \u2013 reading \u201ctourists go home\u201d and \u201ctourist you are the terrorist\u201d \u2013 were sprayed on the walls of listed buildings in the historic quarter of the city at the start of the holiday season. They were quickly removed by police. \u201cIt has been a record year here and has sparked a big political debate over whether the island is now full,\u201d said Humphey Carter of the Majorca Daily Bulletin. Ports in the Balearic Islands have been engulfed by giant cruise ships, with as many as 20,000 cruise passengers arriving every Tuesday morning in Palma. The north-east of the island, once much quieter, has also seen the opening this year of a giant Park Hyatt luxury resort. The store group El Corte Ingl\u00e9s is reported to have enjoyed a sales rise of as much as 25%, although bar owners in Magaluf, long-favoured as a party resort by young Britons, have been less than overwhelmed. Belt-tightening Brits fighting the 15% decline in the value of the pound since the EU referendum have this summer increasingly opted for all-inclusive deals. Thomas Cook said six out of 10 package holidays sold to British holidaymakers this year were on an all-inclusive basis. \u201cYou are seeing a lot more British families in Magaluf and many fewer incidents with the police,\u201d said Carter. \u201cThe bar owners are annoyed that there is so much all-inclusive. The days when you\u2019d see 3,000-4,000 British drunks on the strip [in Magaluf] are gone. They are all getting pissed in the hotels instead.\u201d Gatwick airport said it handled 8.5 million passengers travelling to Spain in the 12 months to July, an increase of 12.2% in a year. Almeria, in the south-east, has seen a 54% increase, while Valencia is up 49% and Seville up 26%. Package holiday operators have battled to find beds for the soaring number of arrivals from Britain. Thomas Cook said it took an early decision to bulk-book many more rooms in Spain this year, adding that other operators have been severely stretched. Many resorts are gearing up for a massively extended summer season, with Spanish hotel federations in the main resorts reporting that occupancy in September is 100%, and that trading for October is at new highs. Many beach resort hotels that traditionally shut down in autumn are now staying open for longer, or not shutting at all. A total of 13 million British tourists visited Spain in 2015, said Abta, up 6% on the year before. It anticipates that 2016 will easily be a record-busting year. \u201cSpain now accounts for around 20% of the total number of visits by British people abroad,\u201d said a spokeswoman. Manel Casals, the director general of the Barcelona hoteliers association, said hotel occupation in June and July was running at 80-89%, the same as last year, but, \u201calthough we don\u2019t yet have the figures, it has been an exceptional August\u201d. Meanwhile, British holidaymakers seeking a last-minute bargain are being directed to Turkey, where desperate hoteliers have dropped prices dramatically. Thomas Cook is offering a week at a five-star resort in Antalya departing this weekend, on an all-inclusive basis, for just \u00a3598. Its cheapest five-star in Mallorca on the same basis is priced at \u00a31,402 a head.",

      "bodyText": "Apple boss Tim Cook is furious. How dare Brussels\u2019 meddling competition regulators retrospectively unpick a tax deal that the iPhone-maker had secured from Ireland a quarter of a century ago. What business is it of theirs? Tax, after all, is a sovereign issue for each individual member state within the European Union. The European commission\u2019s ruling would have a \u201cprofound and harmful effect\u201d on investment and job creation in Europe, he said. His political allies at home have waded in too. US Treasury secretary Jack Lew warned last week that the move could have a \u201cchilling effect on US-EU cross-border investment\u201d. The US would have to \u201cconsider potential responses\u201d. According to the Cook script, Apple is a good corporate citizen with a long history of investment and employment in Ireland. That is why, quite properly, almost two-third\u2019s of the group\u2019s profits arise in its Irish-registered subsidiaries. On Tuesday, he posted a lengthy message direct to customers explaining what a travesty of justice Brussels\u2019 intervention had been, with \u201cno basis in fact or in law\u201d. That, of course, is hogwash. Whatever you think of the commission\u2019s intervention, any honest discussion of Apple\u2019s taxes must start with the admission that its subsidiaries in Knocknaheeny, a run-down suburb of Cork, do not produce almost two-thirds of the group\u2019s profits. That Cook still clings to this narrative is disappointing, and does not reflect well on those advisers he has gathered around him. The Apple CEO would do well to listen a little to the candid reflections of the firm\u2019s co-founder Steve Wozniak. Earlier this year, he said: \u201cI don\u2019t like the idea that Apple might be unfair \u2013 not paying taxes the way I do as a person.\u201d For all that, Wozniak noted, on the other hand there are always commercial pressures at play. \u201cAny company that is a public company, its shareholders are going to force it to be as profitable as possible. And that means financial people studying all the laws of the world and figuring out all the schemes that work that are technically legal.\u201d Cook, though, has his own, cleaner, less equivocal, version of events. And Tuesday was not the first time he has taken to the stage, with faux exasperation, offering justifications of Apple\u2019s huge Irish profits that have for years gone almost entirely untaxed. In 2013, he appeared before the US senate subcommittee on investigations to reject a detailed analysis of the group\u2019s tax planning from Carl Levin (Democrat) and John McCain (Republican). \u201cYou shifted that golden goose to Ireland,\u201d Levin accused Cook, summing up his verdict during a six-hour hearing. \u201cYou shifted it to three companies that do not pay taxes in Ireland \u2026 These are the crown jewels of Apple Inc \u2026 Folks, it\u2019s not right.\u201d Cook affected incredulity. \u201cThere is no [profit] shifting going on that I see at all,\u201d he said. \u201cApple has real operations in real places, with Apple employees selling real products to real customers. We pay all the taxes we owe \u2013 every single dollar \u2026 We don\u2019t depend on tax gimmicks.\u201d That message is now as obsolete as an iPod Classic. Nevertheless, sorting out a fair resolution of Apple\u2019s tax affairs remains less obvious. Where exactly has the tech firm be avoiding its dues? If not Ireland, then where are Apple\u2019s profits truly made? The fact that the group\u2019s tax structure has been subject to fierce attack from critics in both Washington and Brussels shows that there are several parties who feel they are entitled to spoils from any revised tax settlement. At present though, it is Ireland that is set to benefit from the European commission\u2019s decision. And the result could be a one of the largest ever bills for back taxes, running into many billions of euros. Brussels officials have suggested the figure could be up to \u20ac13bn (\u00a311bn), though the final sum will be for the Irish tax office to determine. Add to that sum interest charges stretching back more than 10 years and the final tally could put a modest, but not insignificant, dent in Apple\u2019s colossal offshore reserves. At last count, this cash pile stood at more than $200bn (\u00a3152bn). However dim the view you take of Apple\u2019s tax planning, though, a multibillion euro windfall for Ireland looks perverse. Critics on both sides of the Atlantic have castigated Dublin\u2019s politicians and regulators for helping Apple spirit taxable profits away from other jurisdictions. Why should Irish taxpayers end up winners? It is an uncomfortable irony that Margrethe Vestager, Europe\u2019s competition commissioner, is well aware of. After announcing her Apple decision, she stressed that it was now open to other countries to draw on the commission\u2019s analysis and make their own sub-claims on Apple\u2019s Irish back taxes. Even America, she appeared to hint, could have a call on this money. All of which looks a messy prospect, which is unlikely to be resolved for many years. As Vestager noted, her powers are limited. Occasional moves by Brussels to police the taxation of multinationals need to be complemented by co-ordinated and sustained international efforts that close loopholes and ensure tax regimes keep pace with the digital economy. Some argue that Vestager did more on Tuesday to damage than to assist this fragile international consensus on tackling tax avoidance. Certainly her intervention has ruffled feathers and, in the short term at least, appears to offer a far from perfect resolution. That said, any serious effort to root out toxic tax behaviour is bound to create upset along the way. There are powerful vested interests that would like to see the taxation of corporate profits wither and fade into history. Vestager has set herself against such ambitions. A few more politicians showing her courage would be a fine thing. This article was amended on 31 August.",

Occasional moves by Brussels to police the taxation of multinationals need to be complemented by co-ordinated and sustained international efforts that close loopholes and ensure tax regimes keep pace with the digital economy.</p> <p>Some argue that Vestager did more on Tuesday to damage than to assist this fragile international consensus on tackling tax avoidance. Certainly her intervention has ruffled feathers and, in the short term at least, appears to offer a far from perfect resolution. <br></p> <p>That said, any serious effort to root out toxic tax behaviour is bound to create upset along the way. There are powerful vested interests that would like to see the taxation of corporate profits wither and fade into history. Vestager has set herself against such ambitions. A few more politicians showing her courage would be a fine thing.<br></p> <ul> <li>This article was amended on 31 August.</li> </ul>",

    "webTitle": "EU orders Apple to pay up to \u20ac13bn in Irish taxes - as it happened", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "It was a mixed day for stock markets, with the FTSE 100 returning after the Bank Holiday weekend with an uncertain performance. Dragged down by mining shares, it ended the day marginally lower. Elsewhere though, European markets ended the day in positive territory, even shrugging off an early fall on Wall Street. Following the EU demand that Apple pay \u20ac13bn in Irish taxes, the US technology group has seen its shares dip 0.6%, helped drag the Dow Jones Industrial Average down 56 points or 0.3%. The closing scores in Europe showed: The FTSE 100 fell 17.26 points or 0.25% to 6820.79 Germany\u2019s Dax climbed 1.07% to 10,657.64 France\u2019s Cac closed 0.75% higher at 4457.49 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB finished 1.42% better at 16,891.42 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended 0.8% up at 8685.4 In Greece, the Athens market added 0.48% to 564.37 On that note it\u2019s time to close for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. The US has said it is concerned about Europe\u2019s unilateral approach over international taxation in the wake of the Apple decision, according to Reuters. The White House said if the Europeans have concerns about taxation, they should work jointly with the US. It added that the Apple ruling could hurt the US by allowing the company to deduct European tax payments from US taxes. Former Finnish finance minister Alexander Stubb has weighed in on the Apple debate: More from Irish finance minister Michael Noonan. Speaking to CNBC he said: Apple paid all the tax that was due for their activities in Ireland. The OECD who have been at the forefront of reforming corporation tax say the tax should apply where the economic activity occurs, which generates the profit. Now, on my...the back of my Aplle iPhone, it says, designed in California, manufactured in China. So I can\u2019t see how the Irish authorities would have a tax liability for economic activity, that takes place in other juridictions.... We stand by the legitimacy of what was done in the past. Nobody did a deal with Apple and we stand over that. Secondly, we think the commission is getting involved in what is the competence of sovereign governments in Europe. The Europe treaties say that individual countries are responsible for taxation policy. And this is an approach through the back door, to try and influence tax policy, through competition law, and we don\u2019t agree with that. But more importantly we think they\u2019re in breach of international tax practice, where tax liability follows economic activity, and the economic activity on which they\u2019re raising the tax assessment in Ireland, did not occur in Ireland. Apple shares are currently down just under 1% following the EU tax ruling ordering the company to pay back up to \u20ac13bn in Irish taxes, helping push the Dow Jones Industrial Average 0.25% lower. Jasper Lawler, market analyst at CMC Markets, said: The risk for Ireland is that by taking \u20ac13bn from Apple, there will be a mass exodus of American firms and a resulting loss of jobs and investment. Nobody would dispute that corporations need to pay their fair share of tax, but a retroactive cash-grab creates uncertainty and could impact investment in Europe. Apple\u2019s troubled tax situation will cast a long shadow over the revenue-boosting hopes of [its] new product launch on September 7. Meanwhile Apple-supplier ARM is set to complete its \u00a324bn takeover by Japan\u2019s SoftBank after its shareholders voted overwhelmingly to back the bid. At a court meeting, scheme shareholders voted 95.12% in favour of the deal, while a general meeting later saw 94.92% of votes cast by ordinary shareholders also backing the takeover. Back with Apple, and Ireland needs the US technology group more than the other way round, according to Brad Badertscher, professor of accountancy at the University of Notre Dame\u2019s Mendoza College of Business: I think this will have significant effects on Ireland and the rest of the EU countries. Apple will appeal the ruling and likely pay the taxes many years from now and Apple will do fine going forward but Ireland relies upon Apple for tax revenue (obviously the EU wants them to collect more but at some point more causes Apple to leave and that is likely to happen). Ireland needs Apple more than Apple needs Ireland. Many EU countries used low tax rates to attract large (often US) multinational firms. This door is now closing very quickly and the countries themselves are not happy that the EU is imposing such rules. One of the reasons the UK left the EU was because of the ever increasing power of the EU and this is another example of that power. The strong US consumer confidence figures come despite concerns about the global economy, says Dennis de Jong, managing director of UFX.com, but this may not last: The slight uptick in US consumer confidence for August will have surprised many. Considering the growing global uncertainty on the financial markets, Fed Chair Janet Yellen should be very happy with the results. On the whole, the US consumer has remained a robust proposition within an international context of weakening demand, and the positive data may put the long-speculated interest rate hike further up Yellen\u2019s agenda. The real test, however, is whether this confidence begins to waver as we enter what will surely be the most contentious US presidential race in living memory. Lynn Franco, director of economic indicators at the Conference Board, said: Consumer confidence improved in August to its highest level in nearly a year, after a marginal decline in July. Consumers\u2019 assessment of both current business and labor market conditions was considerably more favorable than last month. Short-term expectations regarding business and employment conditions, as well as personal income prospects, also improved, suggesting the possibility of a moderate pick-up in growth in the coming months. More positive US economic data, with August consumer confidence figures coming in better than expected. According to the Conference Board, the consumer confidence index rose from 96.7 in July to 101.1, better than the 97 forecast and the highest level since September 2015. Elsewhere the Bank of England bought another \u00a31.17bn of long dated bonds - maturing in 15 years or more - as part of its quantitative easing programme. It received offers representing 2.08 times the number of bonds it wanted to buy, up from 1.54 a week ago. German economy minister Sigmar Gabriel has backed the EU ruling that Apple has to pay up to \u20ac13bn in Irish taxes, and named another target. Reuters reports: Gabriel said it was important that companies like Apple and Alphabet Inc\u2019s Google are made to pay their taxes. Meanwhile Irish finance minister Michael Noonan, who earlier said the country would appeal against the EU decision, has been making a few more comments. He told broadcaster RTE: As far as I am concerned there is no economic basis for this decision. It\u2019s bizarre and it\u2019s an exercise in politics by the Competition Commission. They don\u2019t have responsibility for taxes and they are opening a back door through state aid to influence tax policy in European countries when the European treaties say tax policy is a matter for sovereign governments. Only small moves in US markets in early trading on Tuesday, following gains on Monday: Dow Jones: -0.01% at 18,502 S&amp;P 500: +0.01% at 2,181 Nasdaq: -0.05% at 5,230 US house prices dipped by 0.1% in June on a seasonally adjusted basis according to the latest Case-Shiller index. The report, which measures property prices in 20 cities, showed the annual pace of growth slowed to 5.1% from 5.2% in May. Portland, Seattle, and Denver reported the strongest annual rises in June. David Blitzer, managing director and chairman of the index committee at S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices, said: Home prices continued to rise across the country led by the west and the south. Overall, residential real estate and housing is in good shape. Almost time for Wall Street to open. IG is forecasting a very slight fall in US markets: The French president Francois Hollande has thrown the TTIP free trade deal further into doubt by saying it will not be completed before Barack Obama leaves office in January. Hollande said discussions between Europe and the US over the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership had become \u201cbogged down\u201d. Addressing French ambassadors, Hollande said: The negotiations are bogged down, positions have not been respected, it\u2019s clearly unbalanced. It followed comments over the weekend from German economy minister Sigmar Gabriel, who said talks had failed: In my opinion, the negotiations with the United States have de facto failed, even though nobody is really admitting it. The FTSE is lagging its European peers this afternoon. FTSE 100: -0.01% at 6,837 Germany\u2019s DAX: +1% at 10,649 France\u2019s CAC: +0.8% at 4,460 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB: +1.4% at 16,882 Spain\u2019s IBEX: +0.8% at 8,688 Europe\u2019s STOXX 600: +0.6% at 345 In other news, German inflation slowed unexpectedly in August, suggesting price pressures remain weak in Europe\u2019s largest economy. The EU harmonised annual rate of inflation fell to 0.3% from 0.4% in July. Economists polled by Reuters were expecting the rate to pick up to 0.5%. Consumer price inflation on the national measure was unchanged in August at 0.4%. Carsten Brzeski, ING\u2019s chief economist in Germany, say the European Central Bank has a tough job at its policy meeting next week: Today\u2019s German inflation data will not make the ECB\u2019s already difficult life any easier. Ahead of next week\u2019s policy meeting, available data has been too inconclusive to justify any (significant) change to the ECB\u2019s current monetary policy stance. Normally, the staff projections have a so-called cut-off date some ten days ahead of the ECB meeting. This would mean that this week\u2019s set of macro data will not have any impact on the ECB\u2019s staff projections, leaving the projections with a rather benign reaction to the Brexit vote and no hard macro data after the second quarter. Consequently, we expect only very few changes to the ECB staff\u2019s outlook for inflation and growth. Against this background, the ECB will probably try to buy some additional time before making another move. In order not to come entirely empty-handed at next week\u2019s press conference, the ECB could drop the current deposit rate floor for its purchases of government bonds. This would address the increasing problem of bond scarcity and would also buy some time. A Cabinet meeting will be held in Dublin tomorrow to discuss the fallout from the EU\u2019s ruling against Apple\u2019s tax arrangements with the Irish state. Finance Minister Michael Noonan has already briefed his counterpart in the Fianna Fail party, Michael McGrath, about the government\u2019s course of action in appealing against the decision in Brussels. At the heart of the Fine Gael led administration\u2019s objections to any potential \u20ac13 billion tax windfall from Apple is that it would cause Ireland \u201creputational damage\u201d in the eyes of other - mainly US - multi-nationals thinking of establishing their European base in the Republic. Left-wing parties in Ireland have criticised the government\u2019s position on not wanting to force Apple to pay up what the EU says it owes the Irish exchequer . They have demanded that the \u20ac13 billion be channeled into either the Irish health service - the figure is exactly the amount spent each year on public health - or invested in public housing, especially in Dublin where there is a major lack of homes. However, Fine Gael, the main opposition party Fianna Fail, and a host of independent deputies serving as ministers in the coalition government support the policy of a low taxation regime for multi-nationals because they have created hundreds of thousands of jobs in the state. Margrethe Vestager the EU commissioner in charge of competition has spoken to CNBC, and admitted the Apple case is not done and dusted: We have a strong obligation for equal treatment to any country in the EU single market. I think it is more likely that Ireland will continue to appeal the case to the European court system and then of course they will also look at it but that is the most probable situation looking forward. Outlining Apple\u2019s long-standing commitment and economic contribution to Ireland, where it employs almost 6,000 people, Cook goes on to say: Apple is the largest taxpayer in Ireland, the US and the world The company neither sought nor received special tax deals in Ireland Apple is being asked to pay taxes \u201cretroactively\u201d to a government that says it is not owed any money The ruling undermines the sovereignty of EU member states and their ability to deal with their own tax matters Apple will join Ireland in appealing the decision Cook also fires a warning shot on the implications for jobs and investment in Europe: Beyond the obvious targeting of Apple, the most profound and harmful effect of this ruling will be on investment and job creation in Europe. Using the Commission\u2019s theory, every company in Ireland and across Europe is suddenly at risk of being subjected to taxes under laws that never existed. Apple has published a strongly-worded statement from chief executive Tim Cook in response to the EU\u2019s ruling that the company must pay up to \u20ac13bn in back-dated tax to the Irish government. In a statement entitled \u2018a message to the Apple community in Europe\u2019, Cook rejects the EU\u2019s findings and says the US tech giant will appeal the ruling. The European Commission has launched an effort to rewrite Apple\u2019s history in Europe, ignore Ireland\u2019s tax laws and upend the international tax system in the process. The opinion issued on August 30th alleges that Ireland gave Apple a special deal on our taxes. This claim has no basis in fact or in law. We never asked for, nor did we receive, any special deals. We now find ourselves in the unusual position of being ordered to retroactively pay additional taxes to a government that says we don\u2019t owe them any more than we\u2019ve already paid. Cook goes on to say the commission\u2019s move undermines the sovereignty of EU member states: The Commission\u2019s move is unprecedented and it has serious, wide-reaching implications. It is effectively proposing to replace Irish tax laws with a view of what the Commission thinks the law should have been. This would strike a devastating blow to the sovereignty of EU member states over their own tax matters, and to the principle of certainty of law in Europe. Ireland has said they plan to appeal the Commission\u2019s ruling and Apple will do the same. We are confident that the Commission\u2019s order will be reversed. A few more quotes from Margrethe Vestager, the European Commissioner for competition who announced the Apple ruling: Member states cannot give unfair tax benefits to selected companies, no matter if they are European or foreign, large or small, part of a group or not. [In 2011], for every million in profits, it [Apple] paid just \u20ac500 in taxes. This effective tax rate dropped further to as little as 0.005% in 2014 which means that even less was paid in taxes - it was \u20ac50 euros per \u20ac1m in profits. I have the feeling that if my objective tax rate were 0.05% falling to 0.005%, maybe I should have had a second look at my tax bill. Our decision concludes that splitting the profits [between different Apple companies] did not have any factual or economic justification. The company\u2019s head office - or so called head office as it only existed on paper - had no employees, no premises and no real activities. Anneliese Dodds, a British member of the European parliament, says the EU ruling on Ireland\u2019s sweetheart tax deal is a \u201cwatershed moment\u201d in the fight against tax avoidance and evasion. Once again the EU is showing that it leads the way in the fight for tax justice. If the commission has found that the Irish government arranged a special sweetheart deal for Apple in the early 1990s, then it is absolutely right to call an end to this practice and demand that Apple repay the money that it has avoided in taxes for over twenty years. The Tory government in the UK should take note of today\u2019s landmark decision when it approaches Brexit negotiations. Today\u2019s decision should mark a watershed moment in the fight against tax avoidance: the race to the bottom on tax must stop, and we must make sure all companies \u2013 whatever their size \u2013 are able to compete in a fair environment. It is important that the Commission continues to resist interference from the US Government when dealing with tax affairs in Europe. All multinationals, regardless of their country of origin, must abide by EU competition law if they wish to access the European market. The European Commission has provided a graphic to try and help explain Apple\u2019s tax affairs in Ireland: Ireland does not want the money from US tech giant Apple. Michael Noonan, Ireland\u2019s finance minister, says the government will appeal the EU ruling, adding that he disagrees \u201cprofoundly\u201d with the decision in Brussels: The decision leaves me with no choice but to seek cabinet approval to appeal the decision before the European Courts. This is necessary to defend the integrity of our tax system; to provide tax certainty to business; and to challenge the encroachment of EU state aid rules into the sovereign member state competence of taxation. It is important that we send a strong message that Ireland remains an attractive and stable location of choice for long-term substantive investment. Apple has been in Ireland since the 1980s and employs thousands of people in Cork. The company has continued to expand its operations in Ireland in recent times. To put Apple\u2019s Irish unpaid tax bill in context, the Guardian\u2019s Henry McDonald in Dublin says \u20ac13bn is the equivalent of one year\u2019s spending in the Irish health service budget... This is real change, and it is change for the better. - EU commissioner Margrethe Vestager on the Apple tax ruling. The commission found fault with two tax rulings issued by Ireland to Apple that have \u201csubstantially and artificially lowered the tax paid by Apple in Ireland since 1991\u201d. It says almost all profits recorded by two Irish incorporated companies of the Apple group were attributed to a \u201chead office\u201d. However, the commission found these head offices existed only on paper, and could not have generated such profits. These profits allocated to the \u201chead offices\u201d were not subject to tax in any country under specific provisions of the Irish tax law, which are no longer in force. As a result of the allocation method endorsed in the tax rulings, Apple only paid an effective corporate tax rate that declined from 1% in 2003 to 0.005% in 2014 on the profits of Apple Sales International. The European Commission\u2019s investigation into Apple\u2019s tax affairs began in June 2014. It concluded on Tuesday that Ireland has been giving the US tech giant illegal state aid since 1991, adding: The commission can order recovery of illegal state aid for a 10-year period preceding the commission\u2019s first request for information in 2013. Ireland must now recover the unpaid taxes in Ireland from Apple for the years 2003 to 2014 of up to \u20ac13 billion, plus interest. The tax treatment in Ireland enabled Apple to avoid taxation on almost all profits generated by sales of Apple products in the entire EU Single Market. This is due to Apple\u2019s decision to record all sales in Ireland rather than in the countries where the products were sold. This structure is however outside the remit of EU state aid control. If other countries were to require Apple to pay more tax on profits of the two companies over the same period under their national taxation rules, this would reduce the amount to be recovered by Ireland. A few facts about Apple in Ireland from the Guardian\u2019s Henry McDonald: The late Steve Jobs opened Apple\u2019s first base in Ireland in 1980. Apple employs 6,000 people in the Republic, mostly at its main site in Cork. Even with the EU ruling on its tax affairs looming, Apple went ahead with planning permission to expand its facility at Holyhill in Cork which will create an extra 1,000 jobs. Even if Apple pays back millions to the Irish state under EU rules, the windfall gains in 2016 or 2017 will only be allowed to further reduce Ireland\u2019s national debt. Commissioner Margrethe Vestager, in charge of competition policy, says the EU is sending a clear message that illegal state aid will not be tolerated. Member States cannot give tax benefits to selected companies \u2013 this is illegal under EU state aid rules. The Commission\u2019s investigation concluded that Ireland granted illegal tax benefits to Apple, which enabled it to pay substantially less tax than other businesses over many years. In fact, this selective treatment allowed Apple to pay an effective corporate tax rate of 1 per cent on its European profits in 2003 down to 0.005 per cent in 2014. It is now up to Ireland to recover the tax from Apple. The Commission says: The European Commission has concluded that Ireland granted undue tax benefits of up to \u20ac13 billion to Apple. This is illegal under EU state aid rules, because it allowed Apple to pay substantially less tax than other businesses. Ireland must now recover the illegal aid. The full statement on Apple\u2019s Irish tax bill can be found here. Ireland must recover up to \u20ac13bn in taxes from Apple according to an EU ruling. EU regulators say Apple\u2019s unpaid Irish tax bill could be cut if other countries including the US order the company to pay more. The pound is down 0.2% against the dollar this morning at $1.3083. It is roughly flat against the euro at \u20ac1.1710. Confidence in eurozone countries edged lower in August, suggesting the Brexit vote has started to take its toll in the single currency bloc. The European Commission\u2019s economic sentiment indicator fell to 103.5 in August from 104.5 in July. It was weaker than the 104.1 forecast by economists. The business climate indicator fell to a near three-year low of 0.02 this month from 0.38 in July. Jack Allen, European economist at Capital Economics, says the indicators signal a slowdown in the eurozone: August\u2019s fall in the eurozone economic sentiment indicator supports our long-held view that growth in the currency union will slow in the second half of this year. The sectoral breakdown confirmed the fall in consumer confidence and revealed declines in the services, retail and industrial indices. Meanwhile, among the euro-zone\u2019s four largest economies, France was the only country in which the ESI rose. Italy\u2019s index fell to an 18-month low, probably reflecting political uncertainty and concerns about the country\u2019s banks. But the general weakness of ESIs across the euro-zone suggests that more fundamental forces are weighing on growth, such as the fading boost from previous declines in oil prices and the euro exchange rate. Allen says the data suggests quarterly eurozone growth of just 0.1% to 0.2%, from 0.3% in the second quarter. The European Commission is expected to deliver its verdict on Apple\u2019s back-dated Irish tax bill at 11am UK time. The press conference should be live streamed here. Howard Archer at IHS Markit says the weaker-than-expected mortgage data reinforces his expectation that house prices will drop by about 3% towards the end of this year, and by 5% in 2017. We believe housing market activity is likely to be limited over the coming months and prices will weaken as heightened uncertainty following the UK\u2019s vote to leave the EU weighs down on consumer confidence and willingness to engage in major transactions, and also hampers economic activity. The fundamentals for house buyers look likely to soften over the coming months with unemployment rising and purchasing power softening. Scott Bowman, UK economist at Capital Economics, says the drop in mortgage approvals is likely to accelerate in the post Brexit vote environment. July\u2019s UK money and credit figures provided more evidence that the housing market is cooling down. With Brexit uncertainty having driven new buyer enquiries lower in recent months, we suspect that mortgage approvals have further to fall over the rest of the year. There were some initial signs that the Brexit vote has effected consumers too. Indeed, net consumer credit only rose by a monthly \u00a31.2bn, well below the consensus expectation for a \u00a31.7bn increase. The Bank of England figures also revealed a cooling in the amount of credit borrowed by UK consumers. Consumer credit, including credit cards and personal loans, increased by \u00a31.181bn in July, the weakest increase since August 2015. It took the annual rate of growth down to 10.1% from 10.3% - the first drop in growth since December 2014. The figures are contrary to other recent reports that suggest British consumer have shrugged off any uncertainty caused by the Brexit vote. UK banks approved the lowest number of mortgages in July since January 2015 according to the Bank of England. Mortgage approvals fell to 60,912 in the month after the Brexit vote, from 64,152 in June. Economists polled by Reuters had predicted a smaller drop to 61,900 in July. When Janet Yellen gave her highly anticipated speech at Jackson Hole on Friday, commentators initially felt the US Fed chair was sending a hawkish message. But with a bit more time to digest the message, investors appear to have shrugged off concerns that a hike might be coming at the Fed\u2019s September meeting. The probability of a September move increased to 36% from 30%, so there was no huge swing. Yellen said the case for rate rises had \u201cstrengthened\u201d- essentially leaving the door open to a hike before the end of the year - but she gave markets little guidance on timing, saying they would be \u201cgradual\u201d and happen \u201cover time\u201d. Investors will look to the latest US monthly jobs report on Friday for any clue as to whether it makes a September hike more or less likely. Brian Lucey, a professor in finance at Trinity College Dublin, says the EU\u2019s expected ruling on Apple is politically difficult for the Irish government. He told the BBC\u2019s Radio 4 Today programme: Bizarre as though it may seem, on a day when we have been told we have that we have a record level of homelessness among children, the Irish government is going to say no no, we don\u2019t want your filthy money. The reason of course is that they feel if they were to accept the ruling ... that would basically fly in the face of 20/25 years of denials. There are political ramifications from this that they don\u2019t want to face up to. They also feel that were that to be the case they might find themselves under increased pressure in Europe at a time when post Brexit we\u2019re likely to need all the friends we can get in Europe to allow us to cut any special deals regarding the UK\u2019s position with Ireland etc. So they\u2019re in a bit of a bind. Connor Campbell, analyst at Spreadex, gives an insight into the markets this morning: Kicking things off after its Bank Holiday break the UK index rose 20 points after the bell, an upwards move that puts it on track to recover at least some of last week\u2019s gradual losses . If anything the FTSE can feel pleased with any gains at all considering the redness of its mining sector, the likes of BHP Billiton and Rio Tinto down 2.8% and 3.4% respectively. The eurozone was the source of the biggest movers this morning. The DAX surged by 1%, with the CAC not far behind; this meant the former could once again approach 10,650, while the latter held strong at 4,470. European markets are up in early trading, following rises in the US on Monday. FTSE 100: +0.1% at 6,842 Germany\u2019s DAX: +0.5% at 10,595 France\u2019s CAC: +0.5% at 4,444 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB: +1.1% at 16,845 Spain\u2019s IBEX: +0.3% at 8,644 Spanish deflation on the EU harmonised measure of consumer prices eased in August to -0.3% from -0.7% in July. The figure, published by Spain\u2019s statistics office, was in line with expectations. Deflation also eased on Spain\u2019s national measure of consumer prices to -0.1% in August from -0.6% in July. The data come ahead of the flash estimate for eurozone inflation on Wednesday. It is expected to pick up to 0.3% in August from 0.2% in July. Also today... There will be more clues on how well business and consumer confidence is holding up in the eurozone following the Brexit vote in June, with the latest sentiment indexes for August. The Bank of England will publish mortgage approvals and consumer credit data for July, which again will offer some insight into behaviour immediately after the EU vote on 23 June. German inflation data for August will be published ahead of the flash estimate for the wider eurozone on Wednesday. And later in the US the Case-Shiller house price index will be published, as well as the latest consumer confidence report. Europe\u2019s major markets are expected to open higher this morning, with the exception of the FTSE. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Apple is facing a potentially huge bill for back taxes in Ireland, with the European commission expected to give its ruling on the matter today. The commission has been investigating whether Apple\u2019s tax deals with Ireland, which have allowed the company to pay very little tax on income earned throughout Europe, amounted to illegal state aid. We will bring you the decision and reaction when it comes.",

And this is an approach through the back door, to try and influence tax policy, through competition law, and we don\u2019t agree with that.

      "bodyText": "Shareholders in ARM Holdings have overwhelmingly backed a \u00a324bn takeover by Japan\u2019s SoftBank, despite lingering concerns over the sale of Britain\u2019s biggest technology company. More than 95% of the microchip designer\u2019s investors voted in favour of the deal at a meeting in London. The company\u2019s board accepted SoftBank\u2019s cash offer on 18 July. The \u00a317 a share offer represents a premium of more than 40% on ARM\u2019s record closing price. The deal is expected to be completed next Monday. However, Lord Myners, the former City minister, said the takeover was a further example of shareholders selling out for a high price but with little regard for the long-term health of British industry. \u201cIt was a high valuation \u2026 but this is one of Britain\u2019s last wholly owned UK-based technology companies. Decisions will no longer be made in the UK and Cambridge. This is evidence of the City\u2019s predilection for selling at a [high] price and getting out.\u201d To secure the deal, SoftBank made legal commitments to keep ARM\u2019s headquarters in Cambridge and at least double the UK workforce from 1,600 in the next five years. The pledges helped win the approval of the government, which hailed the deal as a post-EU referendum vote of confidence in the UK. ARM chairman Stuart Chambers said that SoftBank\u2019s guarantees on jobs and investment were legal commitments, not merely \u201cnice ideas and promises and intents\u201d. \u201cIf you look at the post-offer undertakings that SoftBank has made, they are extremely strong, they are virtually unprecedented,\u201d he said after the shareholder meeting. Chief executive Simon Segars, who will stay with the company, said that SoftBank shared ARM\u2019s long-term view on investment, including retaining and developing the engineers who were essential to ARM\u2019s success. \u201cWe are not going anywhere, we are still going to be at the heart of British technology. We are growing globally because we are a global business.\u201d He added: \u201cThis represents an exciting new chapter for ARM, and an ability to really grow and do everything we were doing and do more and do it faster.\u201d Myners told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme that if ARM \u2013 which designs microchips for smartphones including the iPhone \u2013 was an American, German, French or Japanese company it would not be allowed to sell itself in 60 days and there would be a review of whether a nationally significant company should be sold. Myners was a minister in the Labour government during the banking crisis and as chairman of Marks &amp; Spencer helped repel Sir Philip Green\u2019s attempt to buy the company in 2004. His comments echoed the views of Hermann Hauser, who helped launch ARM in 1990. On the day the deal was announced, Hauser said: \u201cThis is a sad day for ARM and a sad day for technology in the UK. There will now be strategic decisions taken in Japan that may or may not help ARM in the UK.\u201d He urged the British prime minister, Theresa May, to try to stop the takeover if she was serious about reviving the idea of an industrial strategy. SoftBank\u2019s offer has also raised concerns among Japanese investors that the company, which has $113bn (\u00a386bn) of debt, was overstretching itself. SoftBank has said it is buying Cambridge-based ARM to get ahead in the \u201cinternet of things\u201d that connects everyday devices such as fridges to the web.",

      "bodyText": "After Apple was ordered to pay \u20ac13bn (\u00a311bn) plus interest in back taxes to Ireland, following a ruling by the European commission that the country had given the tech giant illegal tax benefits, it looked as if the Irish were in for a windfall. Except Ireland doesn\u2019t want it. The finance minister, Michael Noonan, says the government will appeal against the ruling, which will hit Ireland\u2019s reputation for low taxes. But here is what they could do with the money: Create an Ireland-Wales tunnel A rail tunnel, similar to the Channel tunnel, has been envisioned for years, linking Dublin to Holyhead in north Wales. It would run for 50 miles under the Irish sea and could take just over an hour to cross \u2013 its cost has been put at around \u00a315bn. Host the Dublin Olympics London 2012 cost about \u00a39bn, so there would be plenty of change left over to nurture medal-winning athletes. Team GB\u2019s Rio medal haul was the payoff for \u00a3274.5m of investment. Build a new town for post-Brexit UK exiles Admittedly, not one that could house all 16,141,241 remain voters, and a million or so regretful leavers, but one or two new towns could be a start. Fund amazing science Ireland could get its own Large Hadron Collider (about \u00a34bn) or send a rover to Mars (Nasa\u2019s Curiosity exploration vehicle cost \u00a31.9bn). China spends about \u00a34.5bn a year on its space programme, and Russia even less. Buy incredible art Until the matter of whether a number of masterpieces in the National Gallery in London actually belong to Ireland is solved, the country could amass quite an art collection. Ireland could follow Qatar, which has become a significant art buyer, spending \u00a31bn annually on building a collection for the Qatar Museums Authority (including, it was rumoured, \u00a3200m for a Paul Gauguin painting last year). Get Kanye to perform every night Kanye West reportedly turned down an offer of a short Las Vegas residency that would have earned him \u00a3380,000 a show. Perhaps it wasn\u2019t enough. Ireland could offer a bit more \u2013 say, \u00a3400,000 \u2013 and have him perform every night for the next 82 years. Gain footballing glory They have more than a consonant change as a point of difference, but the way tiny Iceland has become a footballing nation \u2013 thanks to a huge investment in pitches and coaching at grassroots level \u2013 is an inspirational model to any small nation, particularly those with an unexpected \u00a311bn windfall. Or do something sensible with it Such as pay for Ireland\u2019s health service for a year. Or make a small dent in the national debt.",

      "bodyText": "The pharmaceutical company Mylan is facing more political pressure to confront the price hike of EpiPen after 20 US senators, including Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders, sent an open letter on Tuesday to the company criticising its \u201cexorbitantly expensive\u201d price hikes. Reports emerged last week that the company had implemented a series of gradual price increases inflating the price of the drug from $56.64 to $317.82, a 461% increase in cost since Mylan acquired the rights to EpiPen in 2007. During that same time, Heather Bresch, chief executive officer of Mylan, saw her pay rise $2,453,456 to $18,931,068, a 671% increase. Last week, she sold 100,200 of her shares in the company for more than $5m. \u201cThe EpiPen auto-injector delivers a life-saving dose of epinephrine to patients suffering from anaphylaxis. Anaphylactic shock can lead to serious injury or death if untreated; thus, making sure the EpiPen is readily available for use is a critical part of life for millions of Americans living with severe allergies,\u201d the Democratic senators wrote in the eight-page letter addressed to Bresch. \u201cThe EpiPen, however, has become so exorbitantly expensive that access to this life-saving combination product is in jeopardy for many Americans. \u201cMylan\u2019s near monopoly on the epinephrine auto-injector market has allowed you to increase prices well beyond those that are justified by any increase in the costs of manufacturing the EpiPen,\u201d the senators wrote. The senators gave Bresch a deadline of 12 September to address seven multi-part questions about the company\u2019s \u201cSavings Card\u201d for customers with insurance, patient assistance program, school programs and plans to release a cheaper generic version of the EpiPen in several weeks. They were sceptical of the company\u2019s attempts to defuse the row, noting that the price of the planned generic \u201cis still three times higher than the cost of the branded EpiPen in 2007\u201d. Democratic senators Tammy Baldwin, Richard Blumenthal, Barbara Boxer, Sherrod Brown, Joe Donnelly, Richard J Durbin, Al Franken, Heidi Heitkamp, Mazie K Hirono, Amy Klobuchar, Patrick Leahy, Edward Markey, Chris Murphy, Jack Reed, Brian Schatz, Jon Tester, Tom Udall and Sheldon Whitehouse also signed the letter. Last week, Hillary Clinton commented on the controversy, announcing a plan to reduce drug price increases. In it, the Democratic presidential nominee wrote that manufacturers \u201cshould be required to explain significant price increases, and prove that any additional costs are linked to additional patient benefits and better value\u201d. She called on Mylan to reduce the price \u201cimmediately\u201d. Other lawmakers have already written open letters to both Bresch, who is the the daughter of West Virginia senator Joe Manchin, and the Food and Drug Administration. Senators Susan Collins and Claire McCaskill sent a request for information to Bresch from the Committee on Aging. Iowa senator Chuck Grassley and others asked the FDA for suggestions on \u201calternatives to the EpiPen\u201d. Connecticut senator Richard Blumenthal sent his own letter in addition to the letter sent on Tuesday. \u201cMy office has been contacted by dozens of concerned Connecticut residents, families, and first responders who urgently require your life-saving product but fear that its skyrocketing price has put it out of reach,\u201d Blumenthal wrote last week.

    "webTitle": "Apple ordered to pay up to \u20ac13bn after EU rules Ireland broke state aid laws", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Apple has warned that future investment by multinationals in Europe could be hit after it was ordered to pay a record-breaking \u20ac13bn (\u00a311bn) in back taxes to Ireland. The world\u2019s largest company was presented with the huge bill after the European commission ruled that a sweetheart tax deal between Apple and the Irish tax authorities amounted to illegal state aid. The commission said the deal allowed Apple to pay a maximum tax rate of just 1%. In 2014, the tech firm paid tax at just 0.005%. The usual rate of corporation tax in Ireland is 12.5%. \u201cMember states cannot give tax benefits to selected companies \u2013 this is illegal under EU state aid rules,\u201d said the European competition commissioner, Margrethe Vestager, whose investigation of Apple\u2019s complex tax dealings has taken three years. Vestager\u2019s ruling prompted an angry response from Apple and from Ireland and is likely to spark a political row between the US and the EU. The US Treasury said the ruling threatened to damage \u201cthe important spirit of economic partnership between the US and the EU\u201d. In a letter to customers, Apple\u2019s chief executive, Tim Cook, claimed the ruling could deal a blow to big companies investing in Europe: \u201cBeyond the obvious targeting of Apple, the most profound and harmful effect of this ruling will be on investment and job creation in Europe. Using the commission\u2019s theory, every company in Ireland and across Europe is suddenly at risk of being subjected to taxes under laws that never existed.\u201d The commission said Ireland\u2019s tax arrangements with Apple between 1991 and 2015 had allowed the US company to attribute sales to a \u201chead office\u201d that only existed on paper and could not have generated such profits. The result was that Apple avoided tax on almost all the profit generated from its multi-billion euro sales of iPhones and other products across the EU\u2019s single market. It booked the profits in Ireland rather than the country in which the product was sold. Apple and Ireland said they intend to appeal against the ruling. The figure of \u20ac13bn plus interest is 40 times the previous record for such a case and the equivalent of the annual budget for Ireland\u2019s health service. Irish campaigners called for the windfall to be invested in public housing. The taxable profits of Apple Sales International and Apple Operations Europe did not correspond to economic reality, the commission said. Vestager said: \u201cThe commission\u2019s investigation concluded that Ireland granted illegal tax benefits to Apple, which enabled it to pay substantially less tax than other businesses over many years.\u201d Vestager suggested other countries, including the US, might now examine how Apple did business within their borders. These other jurisdictions might then claim a share of the unpaid tax from Apple for the same period. This would reduce the bill owed to Ireland. Tim Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive, said the commission was rewriting Apple\u2019s record in Ireland, overriding Irish law and disrupting the international tax system. He said Apple chose the Irish city of Cork as its European base 30 years ago and had expanded from 60 workers to almost 6,000 in Ireland. He said Apple would appeal and that he was confident of winning. Cook said: \u201cWe never asked for, nor did we receive, any special deals. We now find ourselves in the unusual position of being ordered to retroactively pay additional taxes to a government that says we don\u2019t owe them any more than we\u2019ve already paid.\u201d The commission\u2019s decision is a rebuff to US efforts to persuade it to drop the case after warnings of retaliation from Washington. Apple, which changed its tax arrangements with Ireland in 2015, should easily be able to pay the huge tax bill because it has a cash mountain of more than $230bn (\u00a3176bn) of cash and securities, mostly held outside the US. The tech group keeps the money outside the US because it would be forced to pay US tax charges if it repatriated the money. The \u20ac13bn figure covers only the 10 years before the commission first requested information in 2013. The commission, which does not have the authority to go back any further, said it was up to Ireland to collect the tax from Apple. The Irish government, however, wants the ruling reversed because it wants to preserve its status as a low-tax base for overseas companies. Ireland\u2019s finance minister, Michael Noonan, said Dublin would appeal against the ruling. He said: \u201cThe decision leaves me with no choice but to seek cabinet approval to appeal. This is necessary to defend the integrity of our tax system, to provide tax certainty to business and to challenge the encroachment of EU state aid rules into the sovereign member state competence of taxation.\u201d A cabinet meeting will be held in Dublin on Wednesday to discuss the fallout from the ruling. At the heart of the Fine Gael-led administration\u2019s objections is that it would cause Ireland reputational damage in the eyes of other mainly US multinationals thinking of establishing their European base in the Republic. Fine Gael, the main opposition party Fianna F\u00e1il, and a host of independent deputies serving as ministers in the coalition government support the low-tax regime for multinationals because it has created hundreds of thousands of jobs. Richard Murphy, a tax campaigner and a professor in international political economy at City University in London, said: \u201cThis is a great day for the sovereignty of the EU\u2019s nations when it comes to tax. They will now be able to choose their own tax policies knowing another state should not be consciously undermining them when doing so. The Irish state has for too long been committed to tax abuse, unfair competition and secrecy, all of which are designed to undermine fair competition and increase inequality.\u201d Prof Louise Gracia of Warwick University business school said: \u201cThis ruling is a serious attempt at curtailing the power large multinationals have in avoiding their tax liabilities, and sends a warning to countries that facilitate hard-edged corporate tax minimisation strategies.\u201d She added: \u201cIt also shines a spotlight on the paltry levels of corporate tax that large multinationals are actually paying.

Republican Donald Trump has said he would force US companies, Apple in particular, to move manufacturing jobs within the nation\u2019s own borders, rather than allowing them to seek cheaper labour overseas. He has also said he would lower the US corporate tax rate. His Democratic rival, Hillary Clinton, has also hinted that she might lower the corporate tax rate. She has closer ties to Apple than Trump.

      "body": "<p>Apple has warned that future investment by multinationals in Europe could be hit after it was ordered to pay a record-breaking \u20ac13bn (\u00a311bn) in back taxes to Ireland.</p> <p>The world\u2019s largest company was presented with the huge bill after the European commission ruled that a sweetheart tax deal between Apple and the Irish tax authorities amounted to illegal state aid.</p> <p>The commission said the deal allowed Apple to pay a maximum tax rate of just 1%. In 2014, the tech firm paid tax at just 0.005%. The usual rate of corporation tax in Ireland is 12.5%.</p> <p>\u201cMember states cannot give tax benefits to selected companies \u2013 this is illegal under EU state aid rules,\u201d said the European competition commissioner, Margrethe Vestager, whose investigation of Apple\u2019s complex tax dealings has taken three years.</p> <p>Vestager\u2019s ruling prompted an angry response from Apple and from Ireland and is likely to spark a political row between the US and the EU. The US Treasury said the ruling threatened to damage \u201cthe important spirit of economic partnership between the US and the EU\u201d.</p> <p>In a letter to customers, Apple\u2019s chief executive, Tim Cook, claimed the ruling could deal a blow to big companies investing in Europe: \u201cBeyond the obvious targeting of Apple, the most profound and harmful effect of this ruling will be on investment and job creation in Europe. Using the commission\u2019s theory, every company in Ireland and across Europe is suddenly at risk of being subjected to taxes under laws that never existed.\u201d</p> <p>The commission said <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/14/ireland-abolish-double-irish-tax-scheme-apple\">Ireland\u2019s tax arrangements</a> with Apple between 1991 and 2015 had allowed the US company to attribute sales to a \u201chead office\u201d that only existed on paper and could not have generated such profits. </p> <p>The result was that Apple avoided tax on almost all the profit generated from its multi-billion euro sales of iPhones and other products across the EU\u2019s single market. It booked the profits in Ireland rather than the country in which the product was sold. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2016/08/corporation_tax-zip/giv-310755cLl2nFXyVR4/\" data-alt=\"Corporation tax rates in Europe\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2016/08/corporation_tax-zip/giv-310755cLl2nFXyVR4/\">Corporation tax rates in Europe</a> <figcaption>Corporation tax rates in Europe.</figcaption> </figure>  <p>Apple and Ireland said they intend to appeal against the ruling. </p> <p>The figure of \u20ac13bn plus interest is 40 times the previous record for such a case and the equivalent of the annual budget for Ireland\u2019s health service. Irish campaigners called for the windfall to be invested in public housing. </p> <p>The taxable profits of Apple Sales International and Apple Operations Europe did not correspond to economic reality, the commission said. </p> <p>Vestager said: \u201cThe commission\u2019s investigation concluded that Ireland granted illegal tax benefits to Apple, which enabled it to pay substantially less tax than other businesses over many years.\u201d<br></p> <p>Vestager suggested other countries, including the US, might now examine how Apple did business within their borders. These other jurisdictions might then claim a share of the unpaid tax from Apple for the same period. This would reduce the bill owed to Ireland.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"648ddfa547ec7e92af423759831b0d05a3ea67e2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/648ddfa547ec7e92af423759831b0d05a3ea67e2/0_0_2041_3000/680.jpg\" alt=\"Tim Cook, Apple CEO.\" width=\"680\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tim Cook, Apple CEO.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Justin Sullivan/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Tim Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive, <a href=\"http://www.apple.com/ie/customer-letter/\">said the commission was rewriting Apple\u2019s record in Ireland</a>, overriding Irish law and disrupting the international tax system. He said Apple chose the Irish city of Cork as its European base 30 years ago and had expanded from 60 workers to almost 6,000 in Ireland. </p> <p>He said Apple would appeal and that he was confident of winning.</p> <p>Cook said: \u201cWe never asked for, nor did we receive, any special deals. We now find ourselves in the unusual position of being ordered to retroactively pay additional taxes to a government that says we don\u2019t owe them any more than we\u2019ve already paid.\u201d</p> <p>The commission\u2019s decision is a rebuff to US efforts to persuade it to drop the case after warnings of retaliation from Washington.<strong> </strong></p> <p>Apple, which changed its tax arrangements with Ireland in 2015, should easily be able to pay the huge tax bill because it has a cash mountain of more than $230bn (\u00a3176bn) of cash and securities, mostly held outside the US. The tech group keeps the money outside the US because it would be forced to pay US tax charges if it repatriated the money.</p> <p>The \u20ac13bn figure covers only the 10 years before the commission first requested information in 2013. The commission, which does not have the authority to go back any further, said it was up to Ireland to collect the tax from Apple.</p> <p>The Irish government, however,<strong> </strong>wants the ruling reversed because it wants to preserve <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/mar/05/ireland-attracts-soaring-level-of-us-investment\">its status as a low-tax base for overseas companies</a>.</p> <p>Ireland\u2019s finance minister, Michael Noonan, said Dublin would appeal against the ruling. He said: \u201cThe decision leaves me with no choice but to seek cabinet approval to appeal. This is necessary to defend the integrity of our tax system, to provide tax certainty to business and to challenge the encroachment of EU state aid rules into the sovereign member state competence of taxation.\u201d</p> <p>A cabinet meeting will be held in Dublin on Wednesday to discuss the fallout from the ruling.<strong> </strong>At the heart of the Fine Gael-led administration\u2019s objections is that it would cause Ireland reputational damage in the eyes of other mainly US multinationals thinking of establishing their European base in the Republic.</p> <p>Fine Gael, the main opposition party Fianna F\u00e1il, and a host of independent deputies serving as ministers in the coalition government support the low-tax regime for multinationals because it has created hundreds of thousands of jobs.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/shortcuts/2016/aug/30/nine-ways-ireland-could-spend-apple-13bn-payback\">A tunnel to Wales or a gallery full of Gauguins: how Ireland could spend Apple\u2019s money</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Richard Murphy, a tax campaigner and a professor in international political economy at City University in London, said: \u201cThis is a great day for the sovereignty of the EU\u2019s nations when it comes to tax.

      "bodyText": "France\u2019s trade minister has increased the pressure on the proposed EU-US trade deal by calling for the talks to be called off. Matthias Fekl, the French minister for foreign trade, tweeted that his government demanded negotiations on the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) should cease. Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, the French president, also raised doubts about TTIP and said France would not support a deal this year. In a speech to French ambassadors, Hollande said: \u201cThe negotiations are bogged down, positions have not been respected, it\u2019s clearly unbalanced.\u201d He said he would withhold support from any agreement reached before the end of Barack Obama\u2019s presidency in January. France has been sceptical about TTIP from the start and has threatened to block the deal, arguing the US has offered little in return for concessions made by Europe. All 28 EU member states and the European parliament will have to ratify TTIP before it comes into force. Fekl\u2019s statement follows similarly gloomy comments from the German economy minister, Sigmar Gabriel. He said on Sunday: \u201cThe negotiations with the United States have de facto failed, even though nobody is really admitting it.\u201d Gabriel\u2019s views were at odds with public comments by the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, who said last month that the proposed US-EU deal was \u201cabsolutely in Europe\u2019s interest\u201d. However, Gabriel, who leads Germany\u2019s centre-left Social Democratic party and is vice-chancellor in Merkel\u2019s coalition government, said: \u201cWe mustn\u2019t submit to the American proposals.\u201d Gabriel said on Sunday that in 14 rounds of talks on the transatlantic pact, the two sides have not agreed on a single common item out of the 27 chapters being discussed. His spokesman blamed lack of movement by the US and said Gabriel had concluded there would not be a deal this year. The US and the EU have been negotiating TTIP for three years to forge a free trade zone covering half the world economy. Both had sought to conclude talks this year, but differences remain. However, a spokesman for the US trade representative, Michael Froman, said talks had not stalled. He told Germany\u2019s Der Spiegel: \u201cNegotiations are in fact making steady progress.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Mortgage approvals fell to an 18-month low in July as aftershocks from the EU referendum result rippled out into the housing market. Figures from the Bank of England showed a drop from 64,152 approvals by banks and building societies in June to 60,912 in July, the lowest monthly total since January 2015. It was also a continuation of a recent trend, following a spike in February to 73,000, which has prompted some analysts to predict that house prices will fall over the next 12 months. Earlier this month, the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors said estate agents were gloomy about their prospects for the year ahead after buying inquiries fell dramatically in July for the fourth month running. With reports showing that Brexit vote uncertainty had driven down new buyer inquiries in recent months, \u201cwe suspect that mortgage approvals have further to fall over the rest of the year\u201d, said Scott Bowman, a UK economist at Capital Economics. Howard Archer, the chief economist at IHS Global Insight, said the marked slowdown added weight to his prediction that house prices could ease back by about 3% over the latter months of 2016, and there could be a further fall of 5% next year. \u201cWe believe housing market activity is likely to be limited over the coming months and prices will weaken, as heightened uncertainty following the UK\u2019s vote to leave the EU weighs down on consumer confidence and a willingness to engage in major transactions,\u201d he said. The Bank figures also showed that the Brexit vote affected consumer borrowing in July, after net consumer credit rose by a monthly total of \u00a31.2bn, the smallest rise since August 2015 and well below the consensus expectation of \u00a31.7bn increase. It was the first annual decline in consumer credit growth since December 2014. Consumer confidence bounced back in August after a slump in July, but remains appreciably lower than before the Brexit vote. The European commission consumer confidence index for the UK climbed to -7.5 in August, from -9.2 in July, compared with -1.2 in June. It had previously trended down gradually from +4.1 in December 2014. Archer said the Bank\u2019s cut in interest rates from 0.5% to 0.25% earlier this month would likely dampen any fall in house prices. However, housing market activity and prices would come under pressure from stretched house-price-to-earnings ratios, and tighter checking of prospective mortgage borrowers by lenders. \u201cAccording to the Halifax, the house-price-to-earnings ratio reached 5.70 in June, which was its highest level since October 2007, before easing back to 5.63 in July. This is well above the long-term [1983-2016] average of 4.16,\u201d he said. \u201cFurthermore, the more uncertain and weakened outlook for the economy could make mortgage lenders tighten their lending standards, and possibly even look to increase their margins on mortgages.\u201d",

    "webTitle": "The Apple tax ruling \u2013 what this means for Ireland, tax and multinationals", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The European commission has ordered Apple to pay back the Irish state up to \u20ac13bn in taxes in a landmark ruling. Apple paid a tax rate on European profits of between 0.005% and 1%, according to the EU\u2019s executive arm. The US technology group, and Ireland, have said they will appeal against the decision but it will have ramifications for countries and companies across Europe. Why has the European commission ordered Ireland to claw back up to \u20ac13bn in tax from Apple? The commission has found that Apple benefited from a sweetheart tax ruling granted by Ireland decades ago, saving the iPhone-maker huge sums in taxes over many years. The ruling was not only generous but gave Apple special tax treatment unavailable to competitors. As such, competition officials in Brussels have found it amounted to unlawful state aid under EU rules. The sweetheart deal allowed Apple to shift up to two-thirds of its global profits through a handful of Irish-registered companies that routinely paid less than 1% tax. Are other companies in the line of fire? Over the past four years the commission has been looking at similar generous tax deals handed out to multinationals, questioning whether they too amount to unlawful state aid. Tax rulings from Luxembourg and the Netherlands \u2013 granted to Fiat and Starbucks respectively \u2013 have already been found unlawful. In both cases the companies are appealing against the commission\u2019s findings. Meanwhile, competition regulators are also investigating a tax deal from Luxembourg awarded to both McDonald\u2019s and Amazon. Will EU taxpayers benefit and will multinationals become more transparent with tax? If the commission\u2019s decision is not overturned on appeal, then Ireland will have to recalculate years of back taxes and send Apple a large bill. That will boost Ireland\u2019s public purse, but in the longer term it may damage its reputation as one of the most attractive places for multinational companies such as Facebook and Google to locate their operations. Will Ireland cease to be a tax haven for multinationals? Ireland has been under pressure to ditch its most aggressive tax deals for multinationals for many years. Pressure comes not just from other European countries, but also from the US, where Ireland has been heavily criticised for helping big businesses hoard profits offshore, beyond the reach of the US tax authorities. The so-called \u201cdouble Irish\u201d tax structure, which has been used by Google, Facebook, Microsoft and Apple, is being phased out. However, Ireland has made sure it has other replacement tax breaks to keep multinationals from moving elsewhere. Will this make US multinationals bring their cash piles home? The last place American multinationals want to move profits is back home to the US, where the 35% headline tax rate is one of the highest in the world. While many big firms worry that Brussels may try to chase these huge cash reserves, they would prefer to be taxed in Europe than America so are unlikely to repatriate funds. Can Apple afford to pay back \u20ac13bn? Yes it can. The technology group \u2013 valued at $570bn on the stock market \u2013 has a cash stockpile of more than $230bn, of which more than 90% is kept outside the US so that it does not attract US tax. Therefore the ruling should not have a material impact on the group\u2019s finances or its considerable research and development spending. The \u20ac13bn represents more than a quarter of its last full year profits, which were $53.4bn and is equal to sales of 20m iPhone6 Plus handsets, at a current UK cost price of \u00a3539. What does \u20ac13bn mean to Ireland? It is a huge sum \u2013 more than the \u20ac12.9bn annual government spending on the Irish health service and nearly one-third of Ireland\u2019s total government tax revenue in 2015, which was \u20ac45.6bn. It is also the equivalent of \u20ac2,830 for every one of Ireland\u2019s 4.6 million population. Could a post-Brexit UK now offer such generous tax deals? Brussels has no power over corporation tax rates, which member states have always been able to set themselves. The former chancellor, George Osborne, had pledged to make Britain the most competitive G20 country in terms of corporation tax. That has seen him set a roadmap that, unless it is adjusted by his successor, Philip Hammond, will soon take the UK corporate tax rate down to 17%. Once it is outside the EU, Britain would have even more leeway to offer special deals to multinationals in the hope they would invest in the UK. That said, such moves could leave Britain looking more and more like a tax haven, and could hamper the willingness of other countries to trade openly with the UK.",

      "bodyText": "Amid the summer lull, it\u2019s time for a little speculative takeover talk. Analysts at RBC have been looking as satellite communication specialist Inmarsat and run the rule over the business as a possible bid target. In a new note, RBC\u2019s Wilton Fry said: Given Inmarsat\u2019s lower share price (especially in US dollar terms), rapid evolution of the industry\u2019s competitive landscape, and historical precedents (e.g., Sky Terra approach in 2009), we believe it is appropriate to consider potential M&amp;A activity. In this note we assess whether there is any rationale for Echostar, or Dish, to approach Inmarsat. Echostar and its sister company Dish Network have recently raised financing and Echostar now has around $3bn in cash on its balance sheet. This money is most likely to be used to fund new satellites at Echostar. However, there is a possibility, in our view, that Echostar or Dish may consider approaching Inmarsat given the compelling strategic and operational logic of a combination; as such, we believe this is a valid topic for investor debate. A bid for Inmarsat could help solve the jigsaw puzzle: We see a number of interlocking situations: (a) Dish has a lot of US spectrum but needs terrestrial deployment; (b) Echostar and Inmarsat both own European S band that could be used for mobile; (c) Mobile needs spectrum given data growth; (d) Deutsche Telekom is involved with Inmarsat\u2019s S-band project and owns T Mobile USA; (e) Inmarsat is global but needs needs more Ka-band; and (f) Echostar has Ka-band but wants to expand globally... We think combining a regional/deep operator like Echostar with a global/ shallow operator like Inmarsat would fulfill Echostar\u2019s global aspirations and help Inmarsat\u2019s need to add capacity in dense areas. We also think it could protect Echostar\u2019s Hughes business, enhance in-flight opportunities, and confront ViaSat\u2019s aspirations whilst simultaneously yielding substantial operational savings from combined satellite control functions. Despite Inmarsat\u2019s larger size ($5.0bn versus $3.6bn) and rating (around 10 times versus 5 times 2017 estimated EBITDA), Echostar has plenty of cash ($3bn) and lower leverage. As an illustration, a 37% premium (12.5 times 2017 estimated EBITDA) with 30% cash/70% equity structure would result in NewCo leverage of 3.2 times net debt/ EBITDA pre- synergies, in line with Inmarsat\u2019s current leverage. RBC has a target price of \u00a311.50 a share on Inmarsat. The company\u2019s shares are currently down 1p at 805.5p.",

In a new note, RBC\u2019s Wilton Fry said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Given Inmarsat\u2019s lower share price (especially in US dollar terms), rapid evolution of the industry\u2019s competitive landscape, and historical precedents (e.g., Sky Terra approach in 2009), we believe it is appropriate to consider potential M&amp;A activity. In this note we assess whether there is any rationale for Echostar, or Dish, to approach Inmarsat. </p> <p>Echostar and its sister company Dish Network have recently raised financing and Echostar now has around $3bn in cash on its balance sheet. This money is most likely to be used to fund new satellites at Echostar.

      "bodyText": "Leading shares are struggling for direction after the long Bank Holiday weekend, but Primark owner Associated British Foods is striding higher. The company is up 64p or more than 2% at \u00a330.14 following a positive note from analysts at RBC, who moved their recommendation from sector perform to outperform and raised their target price from \u00a328 to \u00a334. On Primark RBC said: We think Primark is relatively well positioned as it is the cheapest retailer in the price-conscious UK apparel sector. It has also improved on customer perception for product and style according to our latest customer survey. In addition it has relatively high non-UK exposure (around 50% of Primark and around 57% of group sales) meaning it is relatively shielded from cost and currency pressures in the UK. We expect like for like sales to remain muted owing to a tough consumer backdrop and the lack of an ecommerce offer, however we have raised them slightly versus easy comparisons. And on the company\u2019s sugar business which has struggled recently, RBC said: For Sugar a reduction in EU stock levels and a recent increase in world sugar prices have resulted in a strengthening in European sugar prices. This should help AB Sugar\u2019s profit trajectory from next year. We also think an exit from China would be well received by the market and would further strengthen ABF\u2019s already under- leveraged balance sheet. But mining shares are proving a drag on the market after Friday\u2019s speech by Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen held out the prospect of a rise in US interest rates this year, despite mixed economic signals. The rate rise talk supported the dollar, which in turn hit commodity prices. So Antofagasta has fallen 24.5p to 517p, Rio Tinto is down 105p at 2362.5p, and Glencore has lost 6.1p to 178.9p. Even precious metal miners, often a haven for investors, are under pressure, with Randgold Resources down 350p at \u00a373.25 and Fresnillo falling 65p to \u00a317.25. Mike van Dulken, head of research at Accendo Markets, said: Holding back the [mining] sector are two drivers. The first is technicals after major breakdowns in the prices of key raw materials iron and copper, both barometers of global growth. The second is a stronger US dollar (3-week highs and still rising) which makes the latter more expensive. This is a product of Fed Chair Janet Yellen\u2019s Jackson Hole speech last Friday, one which saw her accomplish the difficult task of offering something for both the doves and hawks on monetary policy watch. The fact that US markets closed only marginally lower on Friday and posted gains last night suggests an absence of panic about another rate rise. Markets appear to be increasingly coming round to the prospect of another US rate hike this year. Friday\u2019s US non-farm payroll numbers will be the next big indicator of the strength or otherwise of the country\u2019s economy, and thus the Fed\u2019s likely view on any move in borrowing costs. Overall the FTSE 100 is virtually unchanged, down just 1.25 points at 6836.80 despite a bigger than expected drop in UK mortgage approvals in July. Among the other gainers, Bunzl is 47p higher at \u00a324.67 after the distribution group reported better than expected first half profits, up 13% to \u00a3210.6m. Banks are better, with Standard Chartered adding 12.1p to 635p and HSBC 9.8p higher at 556.7p.",
