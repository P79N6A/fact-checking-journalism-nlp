      "bodyText": "Demand for beer and party food for Rugby World Cup watchers and school shoes for the new term helped lift retail sales last month, according to industry figures. In the latest report to indicate consumer spending remains the main driver of economic growth, the British Retail Consortium (BRC) said like-for-like sales grew at the fastest annual pace for six months in September. The business group said furniture and footwear sold particularly well. Food and drink were helped by the rugby as well as a pick-up in demand for home-baking productsas the latest season of The Great British Bake Off approached its final. After a sales slide in August, the latest figures showed a stronger finish to the summer, said David McCorquodale, head of retail at KPMG, the report\u2019s co-author. \u201cFashion sales were given a particular boost in September, with more autumnal weather encouraging shoppers to check out the new season ranges and last-minute back-to-school purchases lifting sales of children\u2019s clothes and shoes. Home and furniture also benefited from the bank holiday timing as consumers took the opportunity to fit in a bit of redecorating,\u201d McCorquodale said. Sales values were 2.6% higher than in September 2014, marking a rebound from August when they fell an annual 1.0%. But the results were distorted by the timing of the late August bank holiday, which the BRC counted in August last year and September this year. Growth was also stronger when taking the latest three months together to iron out those distortions. Like-for-like sales for July to September were up 1.1% on a year ago, the fastest growth since the opening three months of the year. Food still falling While sales of non-food items continue to grow, retailers\u2019 takings from food sales have been falling, partly because of a supermarket price war. Food sales declined 1.4% in like-for-like terms during the past three months, while non-food sales rose 3.1%. \u201cRetailers are seeing some improved consumer demand but they continue to operate in a very competitive environment,\u201d Helen Dickinson, the BRC\u2019s chief executive, said. But food sales were up 0.2% over July to September on a total basis, which does not adjust for the effect of new store openings. Economists say, in contrast to the struggling manufacturing and construction sectors of the economy, consumer spending is being boosted by a gradual pick-up in wages, continued record low interest rates and low inflation. Official figures published on Tuesday are expected to show inflation held at zero in September, with some forecasters predicting the rate dipped to -0.1%. The combination of low prices and rising pay recently prompted retailers to say they were experiencing the best business conditions since before the financial crisis erupted in 2007. In a poll by the business group CBI, retailers also said they were upbeat about this month and believed consumers would continue to spend freely.",

      "bodyText": "An American banker is being tipped as the new chief executive of Barclays in a move that could be interpreted as a sign that the scaling back of the investment bank pursued by his predecessor could be put on hold. Jes Staley, who previously worked at JP Morgan before moving to a hedge fund, has emerged as the front runner for the role which was vacated when Antony Jenkins was ousted in July. Jenkins was promoted in the wake of Libor rigging scandal in 2012 to replace Bob Diamond \u2013 an investment banker \u2013 to overhaul the culture of the bank and end the bonus culture. The appointment of another investment banker could be seen as a signal that the more cautious approach taken by Jenkins, who had been in the process of cutting 19,000 jobs as he scaled back of the investment banking division, will be paused or reversed. When Jenkins was removed from his position, the chairman John McFarlane had said more energy needed to be injected into the business. McFarlane has been running the bank day-to-day after Jenkins\u2019 departure alongside finance director Tushar Morzaria \u2013 the leading internal candidate and still the subject of rumours that he could yet take the top job. Another name reportedly linked to the role is Colm Kelleher of Morgan Stanley. Barclays would not comment on a report in the Financial Times about the selection of Staley for the role, which would require approval from regulators. Staley is said to have once been regarded as a potential successor for Jamie Dimon at the top of JP Morgan but left in 2013 by which time he was no longer involved in day-to-day management at the US bank. Shareholders are also expected to keep a keen watch on the pay package agreed for the new boss in light of previous controversies over bonuses at the bank. Staley is said to have been approached to replace Diamond when Jenkins was instead promoted internally. Earlier, McFarlane had been quoted in the FT calling for mergers between European investment banks to create a regional champion able to compete more effectively against US competition. Any appointment of a chief executive may not be announced before the third quarter results on 29 October, by which time the Competition and Markets Authority is scheduled to have published its preliminary findings of a review into small business banking and personal current accounts. Within days of temporarily taking the helm, McFarlane had told senior staff he intended to double the bank\u2019s share price in three years. It was his second stint at running a FTSE 100 company as executive chairman rather than chief executive after replacing Andrew Moss at Aviva in 2012 during the so-called \u201cshareholder spring\u201d. Once a chief executive is installed, McFarlane is expected to return to a more traditional chairman role, with long-standing non-executive director Sir Mike Rake left to concentrate on chairing the payment processing company Worldpay.",

    "webTitle": "Nobel prize in economics won by Angus Deaton - as it happened", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "And that\u2019s the end of the press conference. The Princeton audience give their latest Nobel laureate another bracing round of applause, and Angus Deaton looks suitably pleased. They\u2019ll be holding a celebratory reception shortly, but that won\u2019t be webcast (boo!). So that might be all from us today..... Final question for Angus Deaton - what are you most worried about in the future? I wish getting the Nobel Prize enabled me to look into the future. I\u2019d be talking to my stockbroker, Deaton smiles. But then he turns serious, saying he\u2019s extremely worried about the impact of inequality. Inequality has gone beyond the point where it is helping us to get rich, and is now a very serious threat. He cites inequality as a factor driving climate change. He\u2019s also worried about its impact on politics and democracy. I worry about a world in which the rich get to write the rules which the rest of us have to obey. Q: How did your non-priviliged background help with your understanding of inequality? Deaton agrees that he wasn\u2019t well off until several years after he graduated. That was a valuable experience - but he\u2019s not recommending being poor! Luck also plays a massive role, he continues: If my father hadn\u2019t contracted TB in the second world war, that saved him from being killed on a commando raid, then I wouldn\u2019t have come into being. Next, a question about the role of healthcare in fighting poverty. Deaton says he\u2019s not a fan of the idea that either you get rich then get healthy, or get healthy then get rich. There are lots of third factors, including government intervention -- such as vaccinations, clean water. Deaton is also not keen on the current enthusiasm to give everyone universal healthcare provision - that pledge isn\u2019t much good if you get to the hospital and there\u2019s no-one to care for you. Q: What are your future plans? Deaton says that previous winners have already been in touch to wish him good luck with his time management. He\u2019s still excited about the work he\u2019s already doing, though, so he\u2019s not planning to drop it. Deaton explains that his phone rang shortly after 6am, with a \u201cvery Swedish voice\u201d on the line. They spent a lot of time reassuring me that it wasn\u2019t a prank call, so I then began to worry that it actually was a prank, as that\u2019s the sort of thing they\u2019d say, he jokes. Q: What more has to be done to improve economic growth in Europe? Deaton tells his audience in Princeton that the \u201cgreat concern\u201d is the slowing of economic growth in the developed world, even before the financial crisis. That slowing growth poisons everything... particularly for those at the bottom. There are many people in the rich world who are really suffering, and whose lives are getting worse. They see that as a consequence of what\u2019s happening elsewhere. And the consequences of that could be \u201cvery difficult\u201d indeed, he adds. Onto questions (reminder, you can watch the press conference live here) Deaton begins by paying tribute to his colleagues at Princeton, saying it is a place where you can work without worrying about the \u201cextraneous things\u201d that go on at so many universities. This prize is a tribute to the whole Woodrow Wilson School, he adds, running through an impressive list of previous winners. He jokes that the Nobel committee did an amazing job today, making a video outlining his career. I thought..that\u2019s what I\u2019ve been doing all these years. Deaton also explains that his driving passion has been to be very honest with data, rather than allowing politics to intrude. Now Deaton is on his feet, and looking very happy as the audience give him a thunderous ovation: Janet Currie, professor of economics at Princeton, says Deaton is enormously witty, well-read, great company, and a fine dinner party guest (so get those invite in quickly before his diary fills up) Princeton\u2019s Dean Cecilia Rouse pays a warm tribute, telling Deaton that he\u2019s made the Woodrow Wilson School very proud. Eisgruber also jokes that Deaton\u2019s latest book ,The Great Escape, is now selling extremely well. Angus Deaton is a leader in his field, and also across the campus, Eisgruber adds, who has been a great mentor. Christopher Eisgruber, president of Princeton University, is running through Deaton\u2019s career on this \u201cextraordinary happy day\u201d. First Scotland, to Cambridge University, then teaching at Bristol University, and then Princeton, where he is now the Dwight D. Eisenhower Professor of International Affairs The Princeton economics department cancelled a lecture today, so that students could attend today\u2019s press conference instead, according to the University Press Club. Over at Princeston University, a press conference with Angus Deaton is just starting. The new Nobel economics laureate has taken his seat, to very warm applause There\u2019s a webfeed here -- it did just crash, so I guess there\u2019s plenty of interest. Over on Reuters\u2019 Breaking Views service, Edward Hadas has explained why Deaton\u2019s development of new research techniques that tracked how people actually behave has been so valuable: His new models assume that purchases of each thing are influenced by the prices of many other things. Then there was the discovery that actual and expected incomes influence individual spending behaviour. He also noted that as the incomes of very poor people increase, they tend to eat nicer food. Followers discovered that the arrival of children changes what people buy. Non-residents of economists\u2019 equation-land can smirk at such apparently trivial advances, but Deaton\u2019s next work is undeniably relevant to the real world. He showed, through a combination of observation and theory, that consumption patterns can be tracked accurately by using different sample groups at different times. This led to a massive increase in using relatively small household surveys to follow large economic trends. More here. A quick PS. Nicola Sturgeon, First Minister of Scotland, has congratulated Deaton - even though he\u2019s not a fan of independence. I think that\u2019s probably a good moment to pause this liveblog, although we\u2019ll aim to cover the key points from that Princeston press conference tonight. If you\u2019re just tuning in, please do scroll back to 12pm sharp for rolling coverage of Angus Deaton\u2019s success. Here\u2019s our news story about this year\u2019s Nobel Prize award: Deaton\u2019s success has been warmly welcomed in Princeton, where he\u2019s worked since the early 1980s. Cecilia Rouse, dean of the Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs, says she\u2019s \u201cso thrilled\u201d for him. \u201cThis prize represents a lifetime of important contributions to the understanding of consumption, poverty and inequality. His work is sophisticated and careful, but also passionate. Beyond that, Angus is a tremendous teacher, mentor and colleague. Congratulations.\u201d Princeston are due to hold a press conference later today - at 1.30pm local time, or 6.30pm in the UK. It will be streamed live here. Bloomberg have pulled together nine things you need to know about Angus Deaton. Here\u2019s a few: He\u2019s a Health Guru Deaton is an expert on India. And he says efforts to tackle malnourishment should be mindful of the difference between calorie counts and nourishment. \u201cThe real focus should be on improving health, not just improving calorie counts,\u201d he said in a 2012 interview for a Bloomberg story on hunger in India. His Work Helps Economics Focus on the Real World He focuses on household surveys, saying they can provide a lot of insight into issues such as the relationship between income and calorie consumption, and even on gender discrimination in families. This has given the field of development economics the ability to shift to an empirical enterprise from a theoretical one. He Beat Thomas Piketty* *Sort of. Deaton\u2019s \u201cThe Great Escape,\u2019\u2019 published in 2013, tells how inequality developed over the last 250 years. Piketty\u2019s surprise best seller, \u201cCapital in the Twenty-First Century,\u2019\u2019 came out in English a year later, and is partly famous for its historical analysis of the subject. Though Piketty\u2019s is twice the length (376 pages vs 696 pages). Still, the books are very different and Piketty\u2019s was actually published in French the same year. Development economist Jean Dreze, who has written several papers with Deaton on poverty and nutrition in India, has praised his contribution to shaping economic policy in India. Associated Press has the details: \u201cAngus Deaton is not only a brilliant economist but also a formidable scholar and a great writer. He has shown how intelligent use of survey data can illuminate momentous issues of human welfare and contribute to public reasoning,\u201d Dreze said from the Indian state of Jharkhand. \u201cDeaton\u2019s work has important implications not only for the substance of economic policy in India, but also for the process of policy-making,\u201d he added. \u201cOn the substance, his work calls for significant rethinking of policy priorities, with much greater attention to the social sector in particular. On the process, Angus Deaton is very committed to the idea that public policy should be an outcome of democratic practice, as opposed, say, to professional expertise or randomized controlled trials. That, again, has significant implications since the Indian government is constantly trying to insulate economic policy from public debate.\u201d Michael Strain, deputy director of economic policy studies at the American Enterprise Institute, also cheers Deaton\u2019s success: Cambridge economic historian Charles Read believes that Angus Deaton has been (rightly) recognised for his book on inequality - The Great Escape: Health, Wealth, and the Origins of Inequality. Read explain that Deaton\u2019s reputation for balance has also helped: Although the book has not generated as many newspaper column inches or as much public recognition as Mr Piketty\u2019s blockbuster, Capital in the 21st century, the book\u2019s main conclusions have gone down well in the scholarly community. As we wrote more than a decade ago: \u201cMr Deaton is perhaps the only economist at work in this area who is acknowledged by all sides both as authoritative and as having no ideological axe to grind.\u201d That may well have also been why he was awarded the prize earlier today. Angus Deaton has lived in the US for many years, having been born and educated in Scotland. But he doesn\u2019t support Scottish independence. During his interview with Nobel Media, he was asked \u201cSo do you feel like a Scot, an American, or a combination? Deaton replies: All of them. All of the above. I was very glad that, in the end, the [2014] referendum did not make me forced to choose between being British and Scottish. I feel very Scottish. My father was born in England, my mother was born in Scotland. And as I think someone else said in England at the time, I would feel like I was being personally dismembered. I like the idea of England and Scotland being part of Britain. Angus Deaton has spoken about his excitement when the call from Stockholm came though: He told Adam Smith, chief scientific officer at Nobel Media, in an interview that: My first thought was \u201cOh my goodness, it\u2019s really happening.\u201d There are many, many, many distinguished economists out there who deserve this prize. So you always know it\u2019s a possibility, but you also know it\u2019s a fairly remote possibility, so I was absolutely delighted. Deaton was also able to share the moment with his wife, as she was on the line too. What fun it would be to share that moment, says Smith..... Deaton responds: One\u2019s not actually dressed appropriately..... Perhaps Deaton means he didn\u2019t have that bow tie on.... You can pass on your own congratulations to Angus Deaton, by clicking here. Lenni Montiel, UN assistant secretary-general for Economic Development, has already done so, writing: Congratulations Prof Deaton from UN Department from Economic &amp; Social Affairs. Your work is crucial for our efforts on poverty &amp; inequalities\u201d. He\u2019s tweeted too: If you\u2019re just tuning in, here\u2019s the moment when Angus Deaton was announced as the winner of the 2015 Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel Deaton is an excellent teacher and scholar of economics, says Dani Rodrik of Harvard Kennedy School, who is one of the Nobel Laureates\u2019s former students. US economist Tyler Cowen, of George Mason University, is applauding Angus Deaton\u2019s success, calling it \u201ca brilliant selection\u201d. He explains: Deaton works closely with numbers, and his preferred topics are consumption, poverty, and welfare. \u201cUnderstanding what economic progress really means\u201d I would describe as his core contribution, and analyzing development from the starting point of consumption rather than income is part of his vision. That includes looking at calories, life expectancy, health, and education as part of living standards in a fundamental way. I think of this as a prize about empirics, the importance of economic development, and indirectly a prize about economic history. Think of Deaton as an economist who looks more closely at what poor households consume to get a better sense of their living standards and possible paths for economic development. He truly, deeply understands the implications of economic growth, the benefits of modernity, and political economy. He brought a good deal of methodological individualism to the field of consumption studies, most of all by using household surveys more than macroeconomic data.... Tyler adds that Deaton has been \u201cdescribed by many as a colorful character\u201d. More here. Cambridge University, where Deaton studied and later taught, have added their voice to the congratulations: Back in 2013, Deaton outlined his concerns about the corrosive effects of extreme wealth, in this interview. He warned: On the bright side, if the returns for going to school go up then there\u2019s a big incentive to go to school and that brings you up and that seems terrific. On the other hand if you don\u2019t have the talent to go to school you get left behind and there\u2019s nothing you can do about it. And that sort of inequality doesn\u2019t seem like such a good inequality and the people who don\u2019t have that talent are relatively worse off than they were before. But the really dark side is what you just talked about, which is this issue when you get extreme income inequality and these people that are very very wealthy. They\u2019re so wealthy they hardly need any government. They don\u2019t need government education, they don\u2019t need healthcare, they may not even need the police or the law courts because they can buy lawyers and policemen or whatever. Even the FT\u2019s editor can\u2019t resist that joke.... In his last book, Angus Deaton explained why it is so dangerous to concentrate so much wealth in the hands of a few people. (The Pareto principle states that 80% of wealth is in the hands of 20% of the people) Angus Deaton\u2019s success caps a long, distinguished and hugely influential academic career, says our economics editor Larry Elliott: The broad themes of Deaton\u2019s work were laid out in a paper he co-wrote with John Muellbauer in 1980, An Almost Ideal Demand System. This work explains how public policy affects consumer decisions and was hailed as one of the 20 most influential articles published since 1970 in the presitigious American Economic Review. Piketty\u2019s bestselling book, Capital, owes much to the detailed micro-economic studies conducted by Deaton and Tony Atkinson of Nuffield College, Oxford \u2013 there was some speculation that the prize might have been shared by the two economists this year. It\u2019s hard to distill one man\u2019s work into a few catchy phrases. So the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences has done really well with this four-page PDF on Deaton\u2019s research: Consumption, great and small It explains how: 1) Deaton\u2019s \u201cAlmost Ideal Demand System\u201d made a major contribution to tracking how tax changes change the consumption of various goods, and which social groups will gain or lose. 2) He solved \u201cDeaton\u2019s Paradox\u201d -- data showing that consumption levels only change smoothly even when there are abrupt changes to income. His solution was to study the income and consumption of individuals, not the average income: Since the incomes of some people decrease at the same time as the incomes of others increase, the bulk of individual variations in income average out when we compute the representative consumer\u2019s income. 3) He pioneered the use of economic data at an individual level, rather than simply the aggregate level. 4) He reshaped the way poverty was measured. 5) His research into \u2018poverty traps\u2019 - the question of whether people are poor because they\u2019re hungry (and can\u2019t work enough), or hungry because they\u2019re poor. The question of poverty traps is important in designing international assistance to the poorest countries. If assistance is geared towards encouraging economic growth, but increasing income still does not lead to noticeably increased calorie intake, there is an argument for reorienting assistance towards direct food aid. Deaton\u2019s research on the relationship between income and calorie intake has shed important light on this issue: increased income does indeed lead to more calories being consumed. On the other hand, the evidence does not support the hypothesis that malnutrition explains poverty. In other words, malnutrition is largely the consequence of a low income, not vice versa. US economist Peter Orszag is telling Bloomberg TV that Angus Deaton was a trailblazer in his use of data: They\u2019ll be hanging out the bunting in at Princeton University today, again.... Deaton has just received the ultimate compliment, from Harvard professor Amitabh Chandra: Twitter is abuzz with this sort of joke: ....which won\u2019t mean anything to readers who weren\u2019t raised on Have I Got News For You and Angus Deayton. Angus Deaton has gone off to celebrate, so here\u2019s some instant reaction to his success: Q: How did you feel when you got the news? I felt pretty sleepy, Deaton jokes (he\u2019s in Princeton, I think, where it\u2019s currently 7.30am). But he\u2019s also \u201cdelighted\u201d. He knew that his name had appeared on the list of possible winners, so it was great to hear the news from his friends on the committee. Q: Do you believe that extreme poverty will keep falling? Angus Deaton says he does, but he doesn\u2019t want to be a \u201cblind optimist\u201d. There are enormous numbers of people in the world still in poverty, and tremendous health problems among adults and children. He adds: We are not out of the woods yet. For many people in the world, things are very, very bad. Q: Given your work on poverty, what is your take on the refugee crisis? Angus Deaton says the crisis has its roots in history: What we are seeing now is the result of hundreds of years of unequal development in the rich world, which has left a lot of the world behind. Those people who have been left behind want a better life, and that is putting enormous pressure on the boundaries between the poor world and the rich. Q: So is there a solution? Deaton replies: Poverty reduction in poor countries will solve the problem, but not for a very long time. In the short term, stabilising political instability in war zones would help. Angus Deaton is on the phone now, discussing his award. Angus Deaton has helped to \u201ctransform the fields of microeconomics, macroeconomics, and development economics\u201d, say the Committee, by linking detailed individual choices and aggregate outcomes. Here\u2019s the official announcement, outlining Deaton\u2019s three key contributions: How do consumers distribute their spending among different goods? Answering this question is not only necessary for explaining and forecasting actual consumption patterns, but also crucial in evaluating how policy reforms, like changes in consumption taxes, affect the welfare of different groups. In his early work around 1980, Deaton developed the Almost Ideal Demand System \u2013 a flexible, yet simple, way of estimating how the demand for each good depends on the prices of all goods and on individual incomes. His approach and its later modifications are now standard tools, both in academia and in practical policy evaluation. How much of society\u2019s income is spent and how much is saved? To explain capital formation and the magnitudes of business cycles, it is necessary to understand the interplay between income and consumption over time. In a few papers around 1990, Deaton showed that the prevailing consumption theory could not explain the actual relationships if the starting point was aggregate income and consumption. Instead, one should sum up how individuals adapt their own consumption to their individual income, which fluctuates in a very different way to aggregate income. This research clearly demonstrated why the analysis of individual data is key to untangling the patterns we see in aggregate data, an approach that has since become widely adopted in modern macroeconomics. How do we best measure and analyze welfare and poverty? In his more recent research, Deaton highlights how reliable measures of individual household consumption levels can be used to discern mechanisms behind economic development. His research has uncovered important pitfalls when comparing the extent of poverty across time and place. It has also exemplified how the clever use of household data may shed light on such issues as the relationships between income and calorie intake, and the extent of gender discrimination within the family. Deaton\u2019s focus on household surveys has helped transform development economics from a theoretical field based on aggregate data to an empirical field based on detailed individual data. Angus Deaton is perhaps best well known for the Deaton Paradox -- which explains sharp shocks to income don\u2019t appear to cause equally large shocks to consumption. Deaton is being hailed for his academic work on the links between consumption and income - and how public policy changes can affect rich and poor. The key to his work is measuring how public behaviour changes if, say, the government raises the VAT rate on food. And then extrapolating up from the individual level to tell how these changes affect millions of people. The Nobel Committee says: To design economic policy that promotes welfare and reduces poverty, we must first understand individual consumption choices. More than anyone else, Angus Deaton has enhanced this understanding. By linking detailed individual choices and aggregate outcomes, his research has helped transform the fields of microeconomics, macroeconomics, and development economics. Angus Deaton, aged 69, is based at Princeton, where he researches health, wellbeing, and economic development. He is the Dwight D Eisenhower professor of economics and international affairs at the Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs at Princeton. He\u2019s been in the running for several years. As we wrote last year: Deaton\u2019s best known paper of recent times is \u201cIncome, Health, and Well-Being around the World: Evidence from the Gallup World Poll\u201d in the Journal of Economic Perspectives, 2008. His most recent book, The Great Escape: health, wealth and the origins of inequality, was well-received when it was published last year. The committee are outlining now why he has been recognised.... The Nobel Prize has been awarded to Angus Deaton, the microeconomist born in Edinburgh! Here\u2019s the official announcement: The Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel 2015 was awarded to Angus Deaton \u201cfor his analysis of consumption, poverty, and welfare\u201d. More to follow! Here\u2019s that live feed from Stockholm, in case you missed it earlier: We\u2019re being told that the Nobel Committee will arrive in around 10 minutes to announce this year\u2019s winner(s). Journalists are crowding into the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences\u2019 smartest room, ready for the announcement. Emma Lofgren of The Local Sweden has the word on the floor: On past form, a male US academic is a solid bet..... The tension is mounting in Stockholm, with just 30 minutes until this year\u2019s prize is awarded. The live video feed from the Royal Academy is now working, so just click the play button at the top of the blog to watch the final preparations. Today\u2019s announcement has been months in the making -- and the lucky winner (or winners) must wait until December for the official presentation. It\u2019s now six year since Elinor Ostrom became the first and only woman (so far) to win the Nobel Prize for economics. She died in 2012, prompting \u201cUndercover Economist\u201d Tim Harford to write a lovely piece about her work on common resources, and how they should be shared for the collective good. Here\u2019s a flavour of Do You Believe In Sharing?: Lin was brought up in Depression-era poverty after her Jewish father left her Protestant mother. She was bullied at school \u2013 Beverly Hills High, of all places \u2013 because she was half-Jewish. She divorced her first husband, Charles Scott, after he discouraged her from pursuing an academic career, where she suffered discrimination for years. Initially steered away from mathematics at school, Lin was rejected by the economics programme at UCLA. She was only \u2013 finally \u2013 accepted on a PhD in political science after observing that UCLA\u2019s political science department hadn\u2019t admitted a woman for 40 years. She persevered and secured her PhD after studying the management of fresh water in Los Angeles. In the first half of the 20th century, the city\u2019s water supply had been blighted by competing demands to pump fresh water for drinking and farming. By the 1940s, however, the conflicting parties had begun to resolve their differences. In both her PhD, which she completed in 1965, and subsequent research, Lin showed that such outcomes often came from private individuals or local associations, who came up with their own rules and then lobbied the state to enforce them. In the case of the Los Angeles water producers, they drew up contracts to share their resources and the city\u2019s water supply stabilised. Noah Smith, assistant professor of finance at Stony Brook University, has taken aim at critics of the Nobel economics prize (ahem). Economics, he argues, is actually on an \u201cupward trajectory\u201d, using higher quality data and developing better methodology to handle it. So stop carping. Here\u2019s a flavour: Are the Nobels glorifying peace and literature, and setting these fields up as \u201con a par\u201d with the natural sciences? If so, it\u2019s just one more reason why Nobel prizes are silly. If not, then shush. Sure, econ is (mostly) empirical instead of experimental. It relies mostly on real-world data and natural experiments instead of laboratories. So what? The same is true of ecology and astronomy. I don\u2019t see people writing articles every year saying that these aren\u2019t real sciences and shouldn\u2019t get big gold medals. And don\u2019t forget, folks, it\u2019s only an award. Smith adds: I like Luyendijk\u2019s idea of adding a general social science prize to the Nobel roster. Nobels are silly anyway, so why not have one for every field? While we\u2019re at it, how about one in math and computer science, and one in psych/neuro/cognitive science? And one in visual arts? And one in writing snarky point-by-point rebuttals in blog posts? I think not. Anyway, here\u2019s the full piece: Lazy econ critiques Joris Luyendijk\u2019s trenchant criticism of today\u2019s Economics prize is getting plenty of attention in social media: Here\u2019s a reminder of the winners over the last decade: 2014: Jean Tirole \u201cfor his analysis of market power and regulation\u201d 2013: Eugene F. Fama, Lars Peter Hansen and Robert J. Shiller \u201cfor their empirical analysis of asset prices\u201d 2012: Alvin E. Roth and Lloyd S. Shapley \u201cfor the theory of stable allocations and the practice of market design\u201d 2011: Thomas J. Sargent and Christopher A. Sims: \u201cfor their empirical research on cause and effect in the macroeconomy\u201d 2010: Peter A. Diamond, Dale T. Mortensen and Christopher A. Pissarides \u201cfor their analysis of markets with search frictions\u201d 2009: Elinor Ostrom: \u201cfor her analysis of economic governance, especially the commons\u201d, and Oliver E. Williamson \u201cfor his analysis of economic governance, especially the boundaries of the firm\u201d 2008: Paul Krugman \u201cfor his analysis of trade patterns and location of economic activity 2007: Leonid Hurwicz, Eric S. Maskin and Roger B. Myerson \u201cfor having laid the foundations of mechanism design theory\u201d 2006: Edmund S. Phelps \u201cfor his analysis of intertemporal tradeoffs in macroeconomic policy\u201d 2005: Robert J. Aumann and Thomas C. Schelling \u201cfor having enhanced our understanding of conflict and cooperation through game-theory analysis\u201d The complete list is online here. One year ago tomorrow, French economist Jean Tirole was being plucked from relative obscurity at the Toulouse School of Economics to receive the Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences. Tirole was widely hailed as a solid choice, having spent years researching how governments and regulators should handle mergers, cartels and monopoly industries. Hollywood may never make a film about him, but Tirole\u2019s theories are highly pertinent in an era of tech innovation and disruption. He\u2019s right up there with the most cited economists: With two hours to go until the big announcement, here\u2019s a scene-setter from Agence France-Presse: The 2015 Nobel season wraps up Monday with the announcement of the winner of the economics prize, which could go to research into the job market or consumer behaviour, though no obvious frontrunner stands out. The prize is to be announced on Monday at 1:00 pm (1100 GMT) by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences in Stockholm, and will mark the close of a season that has seen the literature prize go to Belarussian writer Svetlana Alexievich and the peace prize awarded to Tunisia\u2019s National Dialogue Quartet, four civil society groups that helped rescue the only democracy to emerge from the Arab Spring. The economics prize - the only one of the six awards not created in Swedish philanthropist and scientist Alfred Nobel\u2019s 1895 will, instead founded by the Swedish central bank in his memory in 1968 - has been controversial since its inception, with some seeing it as veering too close to politics. Unlike the medicine, physics, and chemistry prizes, all announced last week, \u201ceconomics is not an experimental science,\u201d Peter Englund, the former head of the Economic Sciences Prize Committee, wrote on the Nobel Foundation\u2019s website. And each year, critics note that Alfred Nobel never intended to reward economists. Members of the public often point out that economists have been unreliable in predicting financial crises and economic downturns, and that so far a remedy against mass unemployment remains elusive. If the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences really want to get some attention, they could garland Greece\u2019s former finance minister..... (maybe Yanis could share it with Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble.....) Today\u2019s announcement will be streamed live from Stockholm in a couple of hours. Here\u2019s a web feed (which I\u2019ve tried to embed at the top of this blog too). The announcement will also be posted here. The Bernanke bandwagon is building up speed.... The Wall Street Journal has thrown a handful of potential contenders into the mix, a reminder that economics is a broad church: Perennial favorites have included Paul Romer of New York University and Robert Barro of Harvard University for their work on growth theory. Sir Anthony Atkinson of Oxford University and Angus Deaton of Princeton University have been tabbed in the past as frontrunners if the prize committee decides to recognize research on income inequality. If the committee decides to recognize research in the field of econometrics, Oxford\u2019s Sir David Hendry, Hashem Pesaran of the University of Southern California, and Peter C.B. Phillips of Yale University are often mentioned. On environmental economics and climate change, frequently mentioned candidates include Harvard\u2019s Martin Weitzman and Yale\u2019s William Nordhaus. Other environmental economists that could get the honor include Cambridge University\u2019s Sir Partha Dasgupta. Here\u2019s the WSJ\u2019s preview. The Nobel Prize team have produced some handy facts to tide us over until the announcement at noon -- including that only one woman has ever scooped today\u2019s prize: 46: Prizes in Economic Sciences have been awarded since 1969. 23: Prizes in Economic Sciences have been awarded to one Laureate only. 1: woman have been awarded the Prize in Economic Sciences so far,Elinor Ostrom, in 2009. 51: years was the age of the youngest Laureate in Economic Sciences ever, Kenneth J. Arrow, who was awarded in 1972. 90: years was Leonid Hurwicz when he was awarded the Prize - the oldest Laureate in Economic Sciences ever. 67: is the average age of the Laureates in Economic Sciences the year they were awarded the prize. Maybe we need a Nobel Prize for pedantry too.... Writing in the Guardian today, anthropologist and bank observer Joris Luyendijk argues that the Nobel economics prize is a thoroughly bad thing. Joris reckons that treating economics like a physical science, ruled by fundamental laws which can be derived from data, leads to overconfidence, complacency, excess, and ultimately financial disaster. He wants the profession put in its place, with the other social sciences which measure how humans interact. Here\u2019s his conclusion: A revamped social science Nobel prize could play a similar role, feeding the global conversation with new discoveries and insights from across the social sciences, while always emphasising the need for humility in treating knowledge by humans about humans. One good candidate would be the sociologist Zygmunt Bauman, whose writing on the \u201cliquid modernity\u201d of post-utopian capitalism deserves the largest audience possible. Richard Sennett and his work on the \u201ccorrosion of character\u201d among workers in today\u2019s economies would be another. Will economists volunteer to share their prestigious prize out of their own accord? Their own mainstream economic assumptions about human selfishness suggest they will not. Two economists who have served in the front line of the financial crisis are both in the mix for this years\u2019s award. The AFP newswire explains: This year the jury may choose to honour someone who has combined a research career with the harsh reality of the financial crisis: France\u2019s Olivier Blanchard, who stepped down as chief economist of the International Monetary Fund this month, or Ben Bernanke, the former chairman of the US Federal Reserve. Still, the favourites are a host of decidedly more low-key professors at US universities such as Indian-born Avinash Dixit of Princeton, American economist Robert Barro of Harvard and Finland\u2019s Bengt Holmstrom at MIT. Blanchard would be a controversial choice, given the IMF\u2019s role in the Greek debt crisis where it underestimated the impact of harsh cutbacks on economic growth. But the timing couldn\u2019t be better for Bernanke, who has a new book to plug. Today\u2019s award may go to a British economist, Sir Richard Blundell, for his research into consumer behaviour, labour markets, and the impact of economic downturns on families. Blundell already has a fairly glittering CV for his work in econometrics (using mathematical and statistical techniques on economic data to test theories and make predictions). This includes research into how tax credits encourage people into work and lower poverty (he gave the Adam Smith Lecture on this subject in 2005) -- and the impact on family spending when wages contract. These are important issues in this time of austerity (especially with the UK government cutting back on tax credits). My colleague Phillip Inman explains: A British economist who made his name studying wages, taxes and household spending is among the frontrunners to win the economics Nobel prize when it is announced on Monday. Analysis by Thomson Reuters found that Sir Richard Blundell, the Ricardo professor of political economy at University College London, was cited in more academic papers over the last year than any other economist, indicating that his research on the impact of falling wages on consumer demand has proved hugely influential. Good morning. It\u2019s time for the final act in this year\u2019s Nobel season: the award of the 2014 Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel. Over in Stockholm, Sweden, the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences are preparing to announce the winner of the most prestigious award in economics. This prize is also quite contentious. For a start, it\u2019s not one of the original ones created by Nobel himself, with the wealth accrued from a career developing explosives. Instead, it was created in 1969 to mark the 300th anniversary of Sweden\u2019s central bank. Ever since, people have been arguing about whether economics is a \u2018proper science\u2019 at all, ranked alongside physics, chemistry and medicine (let alone literature or peace). Other social sciences don\u2019t get the same star treatment, and they didn\u2019t fail to stop the greatest financial crash in generations. But still, the award has recognised some serious work over the decades, across the economic sphere. For example, US mathematics genius John Nash was recognised by the Academy in 1994 for his work on game theory. James Tobin, who promoted the idea of a transaction tax to curb financial excess, was honoured in 1981. Two of Margaret Thatcher\u2019s favourite thinkers, Friedrich Hayek and Milton Friedman, have also made the cut. This prize is notoriously difficult to call, but there are some interesting names in the mix this year including a couple of Brits (more on that shortly....) The award is made at 1pm in Stockholm, which is noon in the UK. That\u2019s only 4am on the West Coast of the US, which could be problematic if the award goes to a Californian.....",

This has given the field of development economics the ability to shift to an empirical enterprise from a theoretical one.</p> <h2>He Beat Thomas Piketty*</h2> <p>*Sort of. </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2015/oct/12/nobel-prize-sveriges-riksbank-in-economic-sciences-announcement--live#block-561bac82e4b0889c2b910724\">Deaton\u2019s \u201cThe Great Escape,\u2019\u2019</a> published in 2013, tells how inequality developed over the last 250 years.</p> <p>Piketty\u2019s surprise best seller, \u201cCapital in the Twenty-First Century,\u2019\u2019 came out in English a year later, and is partly famous for its historical analysis of the subject. Though Piketty\u2019s is twice the length (376 pages vs 696 pages). Still, the books are very different and Piketty\u2019s was actually published in French the same year. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/business/statuses/653583455045976065\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">9 things you need to know about Angus Deaton, the 2015 Nobel Economics laureate <a href=\"http://t.co/L24LEqkmVX\">http://t.co/L24LEqkmVX</a> <a href=\"http://t.co/u0onDvWiXF\">pic.twitter.com/u0onDvWiXF</a></p>&mdash; Bloomberg Business (@business) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/business/status/653583455045976065\">October 12, 2015</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-561bc8fce4b07e808ecda5a9\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2015-10-12T14:52:31.792Z\">3.52pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Development economist Jean Dreze, who has written several papers with Deaton on poverty and nutrition in India, has praised his contribution to shaping economic policy in India.</strong></p> <p>Associated Press has the details:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p> \u201cAngus Deaton is not only a brilliant economist but also a formidable scholar and a great writer. He has shown how intelligent use of survey data can illuminate momentous issues of human welfare and contribute to public reasoning,\u201d Dreze said from the Indian state of Jharkhand.</p> <p> \u201cDeaton\u2019s work has important implications not only for the substance of economic policy in India, but also for the process of policy-making,\u201d he added.</p> <p>\u201cOn the substance, his work calls for significant rethinking of policy priorities, with much greater attention to the social sector in particular.</p> <p>On the process, Angus Deaton is very committed to the idea that public policy should be an outcome of democratic practice, as opposed, say, to professional expertise or randomized controlled trials.

So the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences has done really well with this four-page PDF on Deaton\u2019s research:</p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/economic-sciences/laureates/2015/popular-economicsciences2015.pdf\">Consumption, great and small</a></h2> <p>It explains how:</p> <p>1) Deaton\u2019s \u201cAlmost Ideal Demand System\u201d made a major contribution to tracking how tax changes change the consumption of various goods, and which social groups will gain or lose.</p> <p>2) He solved \u201cDeaton\u2019s Paradox\u201d -- data showing that consumption levels only change smoothly even when there are abrupt changes to income. His solution was to study the income and consumption of individuals, not the average income:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Since the incomes of some people decrease at the same time as the incomes of others increase, the bulk of individual variations in income average out when we compute the representative consumer\u2019s income. </p> </blockquote> <p>3) He pioneered the use of economic data at an individual level, rather than simply the aggregate level.</p> <p>4) He reshaped the way poverty was measured.</p> <p>5) His research into \u2018poverty traps\u2019 - the question of whether people are poor because they\u2019re hungry (and can\u2019t work enough), or hungry because they\u2019re poor.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The question of poverty traps is important in designing international assistance to the poorest countries. If assistance is geared towards encouraging economic growth, but increasing income still does not lead to noticeably increased calorie intake, there is an argument for reorienting assistance towards direct food aid.</p> <p>Deaton\u2019s research on the relationship between income and calorie intake has shed important light on this issue: increased income does indeed lead to more calories being consumed. On the other hand, the evidence does not support the hypothesis that malnutrition explains poverty. In other words, malnutrition is largely the consequence of a low income, not vice versa.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3252908d0bad5ee472b9ad241ed6c1508849cae8\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/10/12/1444652993260/094f064d-ce9a-4c78-9b6e-68e891236d99-bestSizeAvailable.png\" alt=\"Angus Deaton\" width=\"450\" height=\"270\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-561ba55be4b027b549471d1f\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2015-10-12T12:20:37.796Z\">1.20pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>US economist Peter Orszag is telling Bloomberg TV that Angus Deaton was a trailblazer in his use of data:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/VonnieQuinn/statuses/653545302109093888\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">&quot;Don&#39;t look at the aggregate.

In his early work around 1980, Deaton developed the Almost Ideal Demand System \u2013 a flexible, yet simple, way of estimating how the demand for each good depends on the prices of all goods and on individual incomes. His approach and its later modifications are now standard tools, both in academia and in practical policy evaluation.</p> </blockquote> <p><em>How much of society\u2019s income is spent and how much is saved?</em> </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>To explain capital formation and the magnitudes of business cycles, it is necessary to understand the interplay between income and consumption over time. In a few papers around 1990, Deaton showed that the prevailing consumption theory could not explain the actual relationships if the starting point was aggregate income and consumption. Instead, one should sum up how individuals adapt their own consumption to their individual income, which fluctuates in a very different way to aggregate income. This research clearly demonstrated why the analysis of individual data is key to untangling the patterns we see in aggregate data, an approach that has since become widely adopted in modern macroeconomics.</p> </blockquote> <p><em>How do we best measure and analyze welfare and poverty?</em> </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>In his more recent research, Deaton highlights how reliable measures of individual household consumption levels can be used to discern mechanisms behind economic development. His research has uncovered important pitfalls when comparing the extent of poverty across time and place.

SABMiller\u2019s chairman, Jan du Plessis, would look ridiculous if, having used those words last week when rejecting a \u00a342.15-a-share proposal from Anheuser-Busch InBev, he then rolled over and said yes to \u00a343.50. In practice, Du Plessis may feel his freedom to speak his mind is constrained by the views of his big shareholders.

But directors are paid to give their opinions on a company\u2019s worth and prospects, not to be an echo chamber. If Du Plessis meant what he said last week, he should reject \u00a343.50 a share whatever his shareholders think. It would not be an outrageous stance. Ever since AB InBev made its move a month ago, \u00a345 a share has always seemed the minimum price SAB should demand to open its books. That\u2019s for two reasons. First, AB InBev timed its move opportunistically. SAB\u2019s shares were trading at close to \u00a338 in March before investors started to fret about emerging markets.

At the very least, SAB should depart at a premium to comparable takeovers in the sector, which implies at least a couple more quid on the current offer. The second reason to reject the latest offer is that SAB has a superb record and investors would be taking little risk in sticking with what they know. SAB is not a Cadbury Schweppes, struggling to defend its chequered returns when Kraft came calling in 2009. It is the world\u2019s second-largest brewer and has only enriched its shareholders during its 15 years on the London market. It doesn\u2019t need a saviour. SAB\u2019s board, having been told of AB InBev\u2019s new offer yesterday morning, did not manage to respond by the time the market closed. That may suggest nervousness in the ranks. But du Plessis\u2019 correct reply should be obvious given his past statements: \u00a343.50 is still not enough. If he says something different, he\u2019s lost his bottle or his command of the English language, or both. Glencore\u2019s debt plans remain in spotlight Under normal circumstances, Ivan Glasenberg would surely wish to be buying, not selling, a couple of second-tier copper mines. After all, Glencore\u2019s great trader told an FT conference the other day that the copper market is \u201cdistorted\u201d and prices do not reflect the low level of stocks and the continued healthy demand from China. These are not normal circumstances. Glencore is obliged to be in the debt-reduction game and would-be buyers of peripheral assets must be given a hearing. Thus the company has appointed investment bankers to check out the real level of interest in the Cobar mine in Australia and Lomas Bayas in Chile. Analysts estimate the mini-collection might fetch up to $1bn. That barely moves the dial in the context of Glencore\u2019s borrowings of $30bn, which is why the main plot still centres on the original plans for reducing borrowings. But these add-on copper negotiations still have significance. We know Glasenberg can over-pay for assets in good times \u2013 witness Xstrata in 2013. But can he persuade others to do the same in a different climate for the mining industry? Tesco\u2019s \u2018brand guarantee\u2019 looks set to disappoint Every supermarket chain likes to claim its new price scheme is the best in the business. In Tesco\u2019s case, however, its new \u201cbrand guarantee\u201d isn\u2019t even better than the version it replaces in one important respect. The new scheme covers only branded products whereas the old one, \u201cprice promise\u201d, also included own-label goods and fresh food. There is an important compensation, of course. Instead of being given a voucher to be redeemed against a future purchase, any money owed will be returned instantly at the till or online checkout. That\u2019s a useful feature if you are the sort of person who loses, or can\u2019t be bothered with, small pieces of paper (and, note, Tesco says half the old vouchers were never used). But, for those Tesco shoppers who are organised and diligent users of vouchers, a narrower scheme that covers fewer goods is plainly inferior. Overall, one suspects this revamp will annoy as many customers as it pleases. It is also odd that Tesco went to the high court last year to defend, successfully, its right to compare the price of its own-label goods against those of Sainsbury\u2019s, which argued its own ingredients were better. What was that fuss all about?",

      "bodyText": "Volkswagen deserves to suffer \u201csubstantial damage\u201d because of the diesel emissions scandal that has rocked the carmaker and affected 11m vehicles worldwide, the British transport secretary has told MPs. Patrick McLoughlin was speaking after the head of VW\u2019s UK operation apologised for the furore and warned that one-in-three of the VW vehicles due to be recalled in Britain required significant hardware repairs which might not be completed by the end of 2016. \u201cThey have behaved in an appalling way,\u201d McLoughlin told the Commons transport select committee on Monday. Referring to VW\u2019s use of so-called defeat devices to cheat emissions tests, he added: \u201cThese devices were made illegal in 1998 and it is unbelievable to think a company the size and reputation of VW have been doing something like this. They are going to suffer very substantial damage as a result and they deserve to.\u201d He said that it drew question about reviewing testing of emissions, \u201cand that\u2019s exactly what we are going to be doing\u201d. He said the UK had led Europe in calling for real-world testing. McLoughlin said he did not rule out taking action against VW in the UK, noting that deception in testing conducted by the Driver &amp; Vehicle Licensing Agency could leave manufacturers open to prosecution. But he defended the wider industry: \u201cI don\u2019t think we should condemn the whole industry because of one player.\u201d He said he was satisfied that no other companies were involved, after receiving assurances. \u201cI would not expect any reputable companies to deliberately mislead once they\u2019ve been asked the specific question,\u201d he said. McLoughlin added: \u201cWe\u2019re talking about an industry that\u2019s very important, I\u2019m determined to work with the industry, not against the industry. We\u2019re in the very early stages of the VW investigation.\u201d VW has admitted that 11m vehicles around the world were fitted with a defeat device, including almost 1.2m in the UK. Speaking at the hearing, Paul Willis, managing director of VW UK, said the company had \u201cfallen short of the standards expected of us\u201d. Of the vehicles affected in the UK, Willis said 400,000 had 1.6-litre engines that require software and hardware repairs. The hardware repair is likely to involve fuel injectors being replaced, he said. \u201cWe will put these cars right to regain the trust of our customers.\u201d However, the VW boss said the recall plan is yet to be approved by German authorities and that it is \u201cimportant we take time to do it correctly for our customers\u201d. The plan is likely to start in early 2016 but it is uncertain whether it will completed by the end of the year given the number of vehicles involved. Willis added: \u201cI have to say to you that there is some risk involved in that.\u201d The fix for motorists in Europe will be different to repairs in the US, where 500,000 vehicles and where the fix is likely to be more substantial because of stringent regulations. Willis said the performance of vehicles should not be affected by the repairs, although he declined to rule it out entirely: \u201cThe brief that our engineers are working to is that there can\u2019t be any change in miles per gallon.\u201d He said it was premature to discuss compensation for VW customers in the UK. However, motorists could be offered loan cars while their vehicle is being repaired. Willis insisted that taxpayers will not lose out if the government wants to launch new tests. MPs pressed Willis to explain who fitted the defeat devices to the vehicles, but the he said the debate would be based on \u201cpure conjecture\u201d, adding: \u201cI find it implausible that senior people in the company would have known of these issues.\u201d Willis said VW had a \u201cbig job\u201d to rebuild trust in the brand and admitted that sales in Britain have \u201cdropped a bit\u201d since the scandal emerged. \u201cWe have got a big job to regain trust and we need openness and transparency,\u201d he continued. \u201cIt is critical we unearth the truth. This investigation [into the scandal] is very important to us, we have to re-establish trust.\u201d Mike Hawes, chief executive of the Society of Motor Manufacturers &amp; Traders, the UK automotive trade body, told the hearing there was no evidence that other carmakers had cheated emissions tests. \u201cI am not aware, nor do I have any evidence, that any other manufacturers has undertaken this activity,\u201d he said. However, Willis criticised the emissions testing regime in Britain, calling it \u201cold fashioned and not fit for purpose\u201d.",

      "bodyText": "A British-born Princeton professor, Angus Deaton, has won the Nobel prize in economics for his work charting global developments in health, wellbeing and inequality. The Nobel Committee said the economist\u2019s work had a major influence, particularly in public policy where it has helped governments determine how different social groups react to specific tax changes. \u201cTo design economic policy that promotes welfare and reduces poverty, we must first understand individual consumption choices,\u201d the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences said, announcing the 8m Swedish krona (\u00a3637,165) prize. \u201cBy linking detailed individual choices and aggregate outcomes, his research has helped transform the fields of microeconomics, macroeconomics, and development economics.\u201d His work complements studies by Thomas Piketty and Sir Tony Atkinson, who was also in the running for the prize, that focus on wealth and income inequality, by examining patterns of consumer spending to illustrate growing inequality in health and wellbeing. He is perhaps best known for the Deaton Paradox \u2013 that sharp shocks to income do not appear to cause equally large shocks to consumption. In his most recent book, The Great Escape: Health, Wealth and the Origins of Inequality, Deaton argues that analysis of economic data shows that while most people in the world have gained in terms of health and wellbeing from higher national incomes, there are many groups that have missed out. This global view is reflected in his latest research, which he says \u201cfocuses on the determinants of health in rich and poor countries, as well as on the measurement of poverty in India and around the world\u201d. In a recent interview he criticised the trend for the world\u2019s richest people to divorce themselves from government control by living inside gated communities and buying their own healthcare and police protection. \u201cWe should not be concerned with others\u2019 good fortune if it brings no harm to us. The mistake is to apply the principle to only one dimension of wellbeing \u2013 money \u2013 and ignore other dimensions, such as the ability to participate in a democratic society, to be well educated, to be healthy and not to be the victim of others\u2019 search for enrichment,\u201d he said. Jean Dreze, an economist based in India who has worked with Deaton, said: \u201cAngus Deaton is not only a brilliant economist but also a formidable scholar and a great writer. He has shown how intelligent use of survey data can illuminate momentous issues of human welfare and contribute to public reasoning.\u201d Measuring poverty is often based on snapshot surveys of income levels, but Deaton is lauded for a more sophisticated analysis, dating back to 1980, tracking groups or cohorts of the population and examining the improvements, or lack of them, in their wellbeing through their consumption of health services and their life expectancy and access to education. Deaton, 69, was born in Edinburgh and educated at the same private school as former prime minister Tony Blair, Fettes College. He went to Cambridge where he gained a PhD and later taught, before moving first to the University of Bristol and then to the outskirts of New York and taking dual citizenship. He is currently the Dwight D Eisenhower professor of economics and international affairs at the Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs at Princeton. The economics prize was created by the Swedish central bank in Alfred Nobel\u2019s memory in 1968. The other five awards were established by Nobel in his will in 1895.",

      "bodyText": "The government has continued selling assets it no longer considers should be held in the public sector with the \u00a3591m disposal of the remaining shares it owns in Royal Mail. Bankers were hopeful of selling the shares, which represented a 14% stake in the company, for less than a 5% discount on the Royal Mail\u2019s share price on Monday at around 455p. Royal Mail shares are trading at about 471p, which values the company at approximately \u00a34.7bn. In June, the government sold about 50% of its then existing stake, amounting to approximately 15% of the company, at 500p per share raising \u00a3750m. Three US-owned banks handled the sale on behalf of the government for zero fees. The banks say they do such deals for the government for prestige reasons and to build up their franchises. Barclays, the UK bank most likely to be able to handle a deal like this, was not included. The original sale of the first 60% of shares in Royal Mail was heavily criticised when bankers priced the shares at 330p, only to see them rise to nearly 618p. Critics said the taxpayer had lost about \u00a31bn on the sale. Bankers on the deal on Monday night reported solid demand, mainly from domestic and US institutional investors, even though the FTSE 100 closed down 0.7%. No shares are being sold directly to private investors. A Department for Business spokesperson said: \u201cThe universal postal service is strongly protected by law and Ofcom has a duty to ensure its provision. Therefore the government sees no policy reason to retain a stake in Royal Mail.\u201d The sale of shares in Royal Mail is part of a privatisation programme outlined by George Osborne at the time of the budget in July. The chancellor said at the time the government aimed to raise about \u00a332bn in the current financial year from major asset sales. So far there have been sales of shares in RBS and Lloyds Bank and two sell-offs of stakes in Royal Mail. The government also plans to sell a \u00a313bn portfolio of Northern Rock mortgage assets and, more problematically perhaps, a chunk of the student loan book. The sale of these types of assets is most likely to appeal to other financial institutions or trade buyers. There are suggestions that three consortia had bid for the Northern Rock assets, known as Granite, by the October 9 deadline. Other assets, such as Channel 4 or Ordnance Survey, are also possibilities for disposal. \u201cThe government is committed to ensuring the effective and efficient management of publicly owned assets, including assessing options for disposal,\u201d a Treasury spokesman said. \u201cWhere there is no longer a strong policy reason for continued public ownership, or where there is potential for an asset to operate more sensibly and efficiently in the private sector, the government will continue to look into the potential sale of public sector assets.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 15 October 2015.

    "webTitle": "Libor interest rate-rigging scandal: British bankers' trial begins in US", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Two British bankers will on Tuesday become the first people to stand trial in the US over allegations of Libor interest rate rigging. Anthony Allen and Anthony Conti, who worked in London for Dutch bank Rabobank, are charged with wire and banking fraud in connection with an alleged global scheme to rig Libor, which underpins $450tn of financial products globally from mortgages to credit card loans. Their trial will begin in a Manhattan courtroom on Tuesday with jury selection. Both men have pleaded not guilty, and claim that the UK authorities in charge of Libor setting knew that the rate was often set in banks\u2019 self-interests. The trial comes shortly after British banker Tom Hayes became the first person to be convicted of Libor rate rigging and was sentenced to 14 years in jail. Joint UK, US and European investigations into alleged Libor rate rigging have led to charges against 22 people and global banks have made fines totally $9bn (\u00a35.9bn). Last month US attorney general Loretta Lynch set out new guidelines designed to ensure that more executives, bankers and other businesspeople are held personally accountable for their actions. It comes after intense criticism that under Obama\u2019s administration very few individuals have been prosecuted for their roles in the 2008 financial crisis or other big corporate scandals. \u201cEffective immediately, we have revised our policy guidance to require that if a company wants any credit for cooperation, any credit at all, it must identify all individuals involved in the wrongdoing, regardless of their position, status or seniority in the company, and provide all relevant facts about their misconduct,\u2019\u2019 deputy attorney general Sally Yates said last month. \u201cIt\u2019s all or nothing. No more picking and choosing what gets disclosed. No more partial credit for cooperation that doesn\u2019t include information about individuals.\u201d Allen, 44, Rabobank\u2019s former global head of liquidity and finance, and Conti, 46, a senior trader, were indicted in the US in October 2014. Allen, who supervised Rabobank\u2019s Libor submission process, is accused of directing the bank\u2019s traders to advise those who made its Libor submissions about any financial interest they had in the rate. Conti is accused of frequently asking the banks\u2019 traders at what rate they would like Libor set. Chatroom and email conversations are included in the prosecution\u2019s case. In one message a New York based Rabobank trader asked Conti where he expected the six-month Libor rate to be set the next day. According to the indictment, Conti replied: \u201cWhere do you like to see it, is more the question?\u201d In another, a trader asked Conti: \u201cGonna need a frickin high 6 mth fix tomorrow if OK with U . . . 5.42?\u201d. He replied: \u201cSend me an email matey for tomorrow.\u201d Allen and Conti lawyers have indicated that they plan to argue that the British Bankers Association, which oversees Libor, was aware that Libor submissions sometimes reflected the banks\u2019 financial interests. Their lawyers have also complained that the decision to charge the British citizens in the US is unfair, given that their alleged misconduct took place in the UK. \u201cThe great injustice, your honour, is that everything in this case has to do with the United Kingdom,\u201d Michael Schachter, Allen\u2019s lawyer, said in court in August. \u201cThis case has nothing to do with the United States whatsoever.\u201d",

Chatroom and email conversations are included in the prosecution\u2019s case. </p> <p>In one message a New York based Rabobank trader asked Conti where he expected the six-month Libor rate to be set the next day.

And on Sunday, Glasgow got a double act as mortifying as the Krankies when thousands gathered to watch as the six remaining tower blocks of the historic Red Road flats were razed to the ground. As the dust settled and the two-year clear-up was pondered, it became clear. Two were still partially standing. What went wrong? Too much tower? Too little explosive?

But how exactly do you plan to blow up half a dozen high-rises that were once the tallest buildings in Europe? \u201cWe\u2019re talking months to prepare for a demolition like the one at Red Road,\u201d explains Emma Thompson, a safety officer at DSR Demolition in South Yorkshire. Although the family firm hasn\u2019t worked on a project as big as Red Road, they have a long history in explosive demolition.

You might do some pre-weakening, which involves taking out walls. You need to drill holes to place explosives, and the depth and angle of each one has to be checked. At Red Road, you\u2019re talking about a steel structure, which requires more explosives of a higher charge weight.

In 2009, a 24m (80ft) building in \u00c7ank\u0131r\u0131, Turkey, toppled into a full somersault instead of collapsing back to its footprint. The same year, a 22-floor residential building in Liuzhou, southern China, split in two when it was exploded, one half crashing sideways to the ground, the other left leaning into the cityscape. Our desire to build up continues nonetheless, accompanied by the need to bring down. The question remains: can an explosion ever be truly controlled? \u201cThere is always the possibility of malfunctioning because you can\u2019t really test explosives,\u201d Thompson admits. \u201cYou can have all the knowledge in the world, and even with identical towers such as Red Road and a contractor that has extensive experience working in the area, there is the chance of an anomaly in the building. Things might not pan out as you planned them. It\u2019s a nerve-racking job,\u201d she concludes. \u201cThe building does what it wants to do in the end.\u201d",

    "webTitle": "Ireland budget: hopes rise for first tax cuts since 2008 crisis", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The Irish government\u2019s improving finances have raised expectations that Tuesday\u2019s 2016 budget announcement will include the first tax cuts since the 2008 financial crisis. Given a surplus of tax revenue over public spending, Enda Kenny\u2019s government is widely expected to introduce the first marginal giveaway budget since the crash, the recession and the previous Fianna F\u00e1il-led administration went cap in hand to the IMF and the EU for a multibillion-euro bailout. The budget is a make-or-break one for Kenny\u2019s Fine Gael-Labour coalition, the last before the next general election, which must be held by 8 April 2016. The\u20ac1.5bn available from the surplus is going to be split equally between capital spending projects, a seasonal week-only 50% increase in pensions and social welfare payments and tax cuts, including to the universal social charge, a tax introduced to help keep public services running after the bailout. Even though the republic enjoys the fastest GDP growth rate in the EU, economic structural issues threaten the Irish recovery, most notably the housing crisis in Dublin. PayPal\u2019s Irish chief executive warned this month that the online internet payment service was finding it difficult to attract highly trained recruits from abroad because of soaring rents and lack of accommodation in the capital. The Dublin entrepreneur Eoin Fitzpatrick is one of those looking out for tax cuts.The 55-year-old, who sells toys and stationery to 2,000 small retailers across the republic and Northern Ireland, personifies the Irish small to medium enterprise (SME) sector, which unlike the republic\u2019s hi-tech export-led growth businesses driven by foreign direct investment (FDI), does not grab the headlines or attract ministerial photo calls. SMEs in Ireland employ a quarter of a million people \u2013 almost double the number working for FDI corporations such as Apple, Google and Dell. Based on an industrial estate close to the Luas light rail system in western Dublin, Fitzpatrick Wholesalers employs 25 workers, with a lifesize talking toy vampire greeting customers in the Halloween section of the warehouse. \u201cWhat are my biggest fears? Any new taxes or any uncertainty over a possible election and a hung parliament,\u201d Fitzpatrick said, surrounded by photographs and souvenirs from China and Hong Kong from where he has been sourcing toys since 1981. He relies on domestic consumption to keep his business afloat. Domestic consumer demand collapsed after the crash and, according to Fitzpatrick, is still in the recovery ward. He emphasised that \u201cit is consumer confidence and consumer spending that keeps us all in a job, especially in this the unglamorous but totally vital section of the Irish economy\u201d. He added: \u201cTaxes and labour laws, such as not letting part-time workers on social welfare do a single hour extra of work at peak times, don\u2019t help. I would say that the picture regarding consumers is very patchy across the country. In Dublin it is a bit better but in rural areas it is either static or just marginally better than last year.\u201d \u201cWhat also concerns me is that there may be regulations in the budget that make it difficult for small to medium enterprises like our own. They are talking about six months maternity and paternity leave in the budget measures but who is going to pay for it? Is the state going to pay or are they going to lumber the employer with the burden of it?\u201d On the industrial estate where Fitzpatrick Wholesalers has been based since 1985, its owner pointed to the number of units still either wholly empty or with \u201cto rent\u201d signs outside as further evidence of the recovery\u2019s fragility. \u201cWe have a patchy and fragile recovery in our demand-led businesses and nothing should be done to make life anymore difficult for us.\u201d While SME owners such as Fitzpatrick prioritise lower taxes, less red tape and political stability, social justice campaigners warn that the housing and rents that are outpacing the cost of a mortgage are not only unfair but pose a threat to recovery. Dr Sean Healy of Social Justice Ireland has claimed there can be no recovery without the promise of more social housing in the budget. \u201cWe recommend that Government fully resource a Social Housing Strategy and expand its scale to effectively eliminate the current waiting list of 90,000 households while also providing for the increased demand for social housing in the coming years,\u201d he said. Even economists who normally have a benign analysis of Ireland\u2019s economic standing join Healy in warning about the consequences of the housing shortage crisis/rent spike phenomenon. A recent Central Statistics Office survey has found that in 80% of Ireland it is cheaper to pay a mortgage than rent. Phillip O\u2019Sullivan, of Investec Ireland Economics, has warned: \u201cFor every five people who left Ireland during the crisis, three moved here. If Ireland becomes prohibitively expensive for young, skilled and mobile workers to enjoy a good quality of life in, the danger is that firms may struggle to fill vacancies, reducing the country\u2019s magnetic draw for overseas companies looking to establish a foothold in Europe.\u201d",

PayPal\u2019s Irish chief executive warned this month that the online internet payment service was finding it difficult to attract highly trained recruits from abroad because of soaring rents and lack of accommodation in the capital.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"http://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2015/10/irish_gdp_bar-zip/giv-31114GZKFt9G2iRmV/\" data-alt=\"Irish GDP growth/decline, quarter-by-quarter percentage, since 2005\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2015/10/irish_gdp_bar-zip/giv-31114GZKFt9G2iRmV/\">Irish GDP growth/decline, quarter-by-quarter percentage, since 2005</a> <figcaption>Irish GDP growth/decline, quarter-by-quarter percentage, since 2005</figcaption> </figure>  <p>The Dublin entrepreneur Eoin Fitzpatrick is one of those looking out for tax cuts.The 55-year-old, who sells toys and stationery to 2,000 small retailers across the republic and Northern Ireland, personifies the Irish small to medium enterprise (SME) sector, which unlike the republic\u2019s hi-tech export-led growth businesses driven by foreign direct investment (FDI), does not grab the headlines or attract ministerial photo calls. </p> <p>SMEs in Ireland employ a quarter of a million people \u2013 almost double the number working for FDI corporations such as Apple, Google and Dell.</p> <p>Based on an industrial estate close to the Luas light rail system in western Dublin, Fitzpatrick Wholesalers employs 25 workers, with a lifesize talking toy vampire greeting customers in the Halloween section of the warehouse.</p> <p>\u201cWhat are my biggest fears? Any new taxes or any uncertainty over a possible election and a hung parliament,\u201d Fitzpatrick said, surrounded by photographs and souvenirs from China and Hong Kong from where he has been sourcing toys since 1981. </p> <p>He relies on domestic consumption to keep his business afloat. Domestic consumer demand collapsed after the crash and, according to Fitzpatrick, is still in the recovery ward. He emphasised that \u201cit is consumer confidence and consumer spending that keeps us all in a job, especially in this the unglamorous but totally vital section of the Irish economy\u201d.</p> <p>He added: \u201cTaxes and labour laws, such as not letting part-time workers on social welfare do a single hour extra of work at peak times, don\u2019t help. I would say that the picture regarding consumers is very patchy across the country. In Dublin it is a bit better but in rural areas it is either static or just marginally better than last year.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat also concerns me is that there may be regulations in the budget that make it difficult for small to medium enterprises like our own. They are talking about six months maternity and paternity leave in the budget measures but who is going to pay for it? Is the state going to pay or are they going to lumber the employer with the burden of it?\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ac1b2bf6be01b74bb5e820a09fcdb401a364e6ff\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ac1b2bf6be01b74bb5e820a09fcdb401a364e6ff/0_53_3600_2162/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Eoin Fitzpatrick, of Fitzpatrick Wholesale\" width=\"1000\" height=\"601\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Eoin Fitzpatrick, of Fitzpatrick Wholesale, who says: \u2018What are my biggest fears?

A recent Central Statistics Office survey has found that in 80% of Ireland it is cheaper to pay a mortgage than rent.</p> <p>Phillip O\u2019Sullivan, of Investec Ireland Economics, has warned: \u201cFor every five people who left Ireland during the crisis, three moved here. If Ireland becomes prohibitively expensive for young, skilled and mobile workers to enjoy a good quality of life in, the danger is that firms may struggle to fill vacancies, reducing the country\u2019s magnetic draw for overseas companies looking to establish a foothold in Europe.\u201d</p>",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The board of SABMiller is warming to the approaches of Anheuser-Busch InBev following a fourth informal bid approach which values the UK-listed brewer at \u00a367.4bn. The maker of Budweiser and Stella Artois raised its offer to \u00a343.50 a share from \u00a342.15 in cash, with a partial share alternative aimed at SABMiller\u2019s two largest shareholders Altria and the Santo Domingo family. It pointed out the new offer was a 48% premium to the UK-listed brewer\u2019s share price on 14 September, before news broke of talks between the two. The combination of the world\u2019s first and second brewers would create a giant company making a third of the world\u2019s beer. The SABMiller board, which has rejected three earlier approaches, did not issue a statement declining the latest offer as it has done on previous occasions nor did it say it was accepting the deal. \u201cThis offer does provide the basis for some form of engagement,\u201d said one person who knows some of the major players well. Shares of SAB, maker of beers including Peroni and Grolsch, were down marginally at \u00a336.67, as some investors worried the parties remained too far apart to agree to a deal. \u201cThe last reaction from SAB was that the previous offer was significantly undervaluing it,\u201d said Morningstar analyst Phil Gorham. \u201cThe latest offer is not a significant improvement.\u201d At least one institutional shareholder contacted by the Guardian felt the 3% increase on the previous offer was not sufficient for it to agree to a deal. Some said SABMiller should hold out for a bid nearer to \u00a345 a share, but accepted the current offer might further split shareholders, raising fears among some that the bidder could walk away. Altria, the owner of Phillip Morris cigarettes, which controls 27% of SABMiller, has already agreed to accept the lower offer. But Bevco, the vehicle controlled by the wealthy Santo Domingo family of Colombia, which has 14%, has so far rejected AB InBev\u2019s approaches on valuation grounds. The cash-and-share alternative, which is designed to appeal to Altria and the Santo Domingo families in particular, to assist them in avoiding large tax bills, has been sweetened in the latest proposal. However, it values SABMiller shares at only \u00a338.88, short of the main cash offer and there may be room for it to be improved further. Significantly the cash element of that alternative offer has been raised by 119p to 356p. The further increase in the offer from the Brazilian-Belgian brewer, albeit a relatively small one, will intensify pressure on SABMiller\u2019s chairman, Jan du Plessis, to open talks on a deal to buy the group, which was founded 120 years ago as South African Breweries. The view of the Santo Domingo family will be crucial because the bidder has made it clear it favours a friendly merger. Du Plessis last year fought off a merger approach from Glencore as chairman of miner Rio Tinto. The new offer came before Wednesday\u2019s bid deadline and after SABMiller\u2019s fourth-biggest shareholder earlier in the day rejected AB InBev\u2019s previous price as too low. \u201cWe have confidence in the board and we will rely on their judgment. They have said the price is too low and we agree with them,\u201d said Dan Matjila, chief executive of Public Investment Corporation.. The South African investment manager, which owns about 3% of SABMiller, said last week it would seek guidance from brewery group\u2019s board about the financial aspects of the proposed deal. It is the latest major SABMiller investor to say AB InBev\u2019s approach is too low to buy the company, whose brands also include Castle beer in Africa. SABMiller\u2019s board has said the proposal \u201cvery substantially undervalues\u201d the business. SABMiller shares rose 0.8% on news of the latest offer. Aberdeen Asset Management said last week it could see the potential benefits of a merger but that AB InBev\u2019s proposed offer was opportunistic and too low. SABMiller\u2019s fifth-largest shareholder, Kulczyk Investments, rejected AB InBev\u2019s valuation. Investec, another significant investor, was also reported to be against the deal. AB InBev\u2019s chief executive, Carlos Brito, has urged SABMiller shareholders to tell their board to enter serious talks before Wednesday\u2019s 5pm deadline for AB InBev to lodge a formal offer.",

      "bodyText": "Six Air France workers have been arrested on suspicion of attacking company directors, a week after staff ripped off executives\u2019 shirts in a protest over job cuts. Police arrived at the homes of suspects on Monday morning after allegedly identifying them from footage of airline staff forcing their way into a directors\u2019 meeting where 2,900 redundancies were being announced. Police and judicial sources said five Air France staff, all members of the CGT union, were arrested at their homes in the Paris region and would be held in custody in the capital. A sixth person was placed in custody later in the day, CGT said in a statement in which it accused the French prime minister, Manuel Valls, who condemned the violence, of helping the airline management undermine union activism. Pictures of strikers storming the meeting made headlines around the world last Monday. As members of the executive committee met to discuss plans to restructure the loss-making airline, furious staff set upon two human resources directors, shredding their jackets and shirts and leaving one scrambling over a wire fence bare-chested apart from his tie. A total of seven people \u2013 five Air France staff and two police officers \u2013 were injured, one of them seriously, in the unprecedented scenes at the airline\u2019s headquarters near Roissy/Charles de Gaulle airport outside Paris. At least 10 legal complaints have been lodged by six security staff, three company directors and Air France. As well as the judicial inquiry, Air France has launched an internal investigation to identify the attackers. Didier Fauverte, a senior union leader at Air France, confirmed suspects worked in the freight department and were members of the powerful CGT union. He said another four or five staff could be disciplined after singing \u201cno shirts, no trousers\u201d during the attacks. \u201cIf it wasn\u2019t so serious, it would be laughable. To be disciplined because you sing a song \u2026 they could punish half the world for that,\u201d Fauverte told Le Figaro newspaper. \u201cI\u2019d very much like to continue negotiations but if it\u2019s on this basis, I think these negotiations will be over quickly.\u201d The CGT union said the arrests were designed to frighten and intimidate staff. \u201cIt\u2019s not going to help matters,\u201d Fauverte told Europe 1. \u201cI think there\u2019ll be other staff belonging to other unions accused, and all this will just keep the pot boiling.\u201d The arrested men are accused of \u201cwilful violence in a meeting and hindering the conduct of a works council\u201d, an offence that carries a sentence of up to five years in prison. Air France is also suing for damage to its property. Workers were planning a demonstration of support at the Air France headquarters on Monday afternoon. A spokesperson for the airline said the company would not comment on the ongoing legal inquiry. An opinion poll by Ifop for the newspaper Sud Ouest found that the majority of French people surveyed \u2013 54% \u2013 said they could understand the workers\u2019 violence, even if they did not approve of it. Poll findings divided along predictable lines, with company bosses less sympathetic. French political leaders including the president, Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, have described the violence as unacceptable.",

To qualify for Brand Guarantee, shoppers must buy a basket containing at least 10 different products, including at least one branded product, such as Heinz baked beans. The promotion is only available in Tesco\u2019s largest stores and online, so Tesco Express convenience stores are excluded. The scheme does not include own-label goods. Nick Bubb, retail analyst, said: \u201cThere is a lot of smoke and mirrors about most supermarket price-cutting campaigns, but the new Tesco Brand Guarantee scheme could be a gamechanger for the industry, as it does away with money-off coupons in favour of an instant discount at the till, and it will be interesting to see how Sainsbury\u2019s etc respond.\u201d Bubb said that the fact Tesco had not announced the new promotion in a stock market statement suggested the cost of Brand Guarantee will not be material or that the company will offset the costs by putting up the price of own-label products. Shares in Tesco fell by 1.25% to 202.25p in early trading on Monday. Clive Black, analyst at Shore Capital, said: \u201cSuch a move will mean that Tesco is no longer dishing out reams of paper at the till, which will be a saving in-store in its own right. \u201c\u200eAdditionally, the price perception of Tesco may by default improve as the plethora of coupons will not be telling its customers just how expensive it is. \u201cWhilst so, we have a big problem with all this stuff in that shoppers have, in the main, moved on. British shoppers know that the limited assortment discounters [Aldi and Lidl] are cheaper than the superstores and to focus only on matching prices of the big four is simply myopic to our minds. \u201cWhy not scrap what was an increasingly meaningless \u2018price promise\u2019 altogether and just have confidence in the reality of Tesco\u2019s price file?\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Glencore has announced plans to sell copper mines in Australia and Chile as the embattled commodity trader and miner seeks to reduce its debts. Asset sales are part of Glencore\u2019s plan to cut $30bn (\u00a320bn) of net debt by a third after a slump in the price of commodities it trades and mines. It has suspended its dividend, raised $2.5bn by selling shares and halted operations at two African mines. Its share price has more than halved this year as a result of the collapse in commodity prices as demand from China falls. The company said it decided to sell the Cobar and Lomas Bayas mines after a number of potential bidders made enquiries. Glencore shares were suspended in Hong Kong before the announcement was made. Glencore said: \u201cThis will allow potential buyers to bid to purchase either one or both of the mines and may or may not result in a sale. Glencore will issue an update only in the event a sale is agreed or disclosure is otherwise required.\u201d Cobar, in New South Wales, is an underground mine producing about 1.1m tonnes of copper a year. The open pit Lomas Bayas mine is 80 miles from the Chilean port of Antofagasta and produces low-grade copper ore that is converted to copper cathode. The company, led by chief executive Ivan Glasenberg, is also looking to sell a minority stake in its agricultural business. Last month it sold a Brazilian nickel project. Last week, Glencore prompted the biggest rise in zinc prices for a decade when it announced it would cut its production of the metal by a third.",
