      "bodyText": "Russia\u2019s credit rating has been downgraded to junk status for the first time in a decade due to the collapsing oil price, the tumbling value of the rouble and sanctions imposed because of its intervention in Ukraine. Ratings agency Standard &amp; Poor\u2019s said the downgrade was caused by the country\u2019s reduced flexibility to cut interest rates and a weakening of the financial system. The ratings agency said the Central Bank of Russia \u201cfaces increasingly difficult monetary policy decisions while also trying to support sustainable GDP growth\u201d. It added: \u201cThese challenges result from the inflationary effects of exchange rate depreciation and sanctions from the west as well as counter-sanctions imposed by Russia.\u201d Attempts to shore up the value of the rouble have had only a temporary effect, Standard &amp; Poor\u2019s said, noting that the 750 basis point rise in interest rates last month to take interest rates up to 17% had only a limited impact on the rouble-dollar exchange rate. \u201cThe rouble briefly appreciated against the dollar but has since continued to depreciate, reaching about 66 roubles to the dollar, compared to about 35 a year ago,\u201d S&amp;P said. The move pushed the rouble lower against the US currency on Monday , at 67 per dollar. The ratings agency warned it had put the new rating on a negative outlook because of fears that the central bank\u2019s ability to move interest rates could become limited, especially if the country imposed exchange controls. \u201cWe could lower the ratings if external and fiscal buffers deteriorate over the next 12 months faster than we currently expect,\u201d the agency said. But it added: \u201cWe could revise the outlook to stable if Russia\u2019s financial stability and economic growth prospects were to improve\u201d. The agency warned on 23 December that it was considering a downgrade because of concerns about the weakening the economy. Rival agencies have not pushed Russia\u2019s rating into junk territory although there are expectations that they will echo the S&amp;P decision. The lower the debt rating the more expensive it is to borrow and makes its impossible for some investors to hold the debt at all. The move comes after data showed the Russian economy contracted for the first time in five years in November, after warnings by economists that the country faced outright recession if oil prices kept falling. The country is one of the world\u2019s biggest energy exporters and the reduction in the oil price by more than half in the past six months to below $50 a barrel is reverberating through the economy. The central bank has warned that GDP could shrink by as much as 4.8% this year if oil prices fail to recover. The banking system is already being bailed out and economists at the Capital Economics thinktank have calculated that further support may be need for the financial sector. \u201cBank recapitalisations of between 1.2tn roubles (2% of GDP) and 2.5tn roubles (5% of GDP) might be needed to bring the banking sector\u2019s capital adequacy ratio back to the regulatory minimum of 10%,\u201d said William Jackson, the thinktank\u2019s senior emerging markets economist. He said the rouble crisis appeared to have triggered deposit flight, which may have forced banks to sell assets at depressed prices while the forecasts for a fall in GDP could also cause a rise in bad debts. \u201cAt this stage, it\u2019s hard to tell quite how hard the hit to banks has been, but they\u2019re clearly suffering,\u201d said Jackson, adding that there could also be a credit crunch. According to the analysis by S&amp;P, inflation could rise above 15% this year and the banks will suffer an increase in bad debts on their balance sheets.",

      "bodyText": "The boss of Mattel, the company that makes Barbie dolls, was fired on Monday after the firm reported collapsing profits as girls fall out of love with Barbie and Ken. Bryan Stockton, Mattel\u2019s chairman and chief executive, was sacked by the company\u2019s board on Monday morning after the firm reported a 59% drop in profits. Mattel, which also makes Fisher-Price preschool toys and Hot Wheels toy cars, said the company needed a \u201cleadership change\u201d to revitalise the firm and rapidly adapt to children\u2019s changing preferences. Barbie has fallen out of favour with young girls, who are switching to tablets and dolls based on movie characters like Walt Disney\u2019s hit animated movie Frozen. In 2009, Barbie accounted for more than quarter of all doll sales in the US, but that had fallen to 19.6% in 2013. Last year, Mattel lost its crown as the world\u2019s biggest toy company when it was overtaken by Lego as the globe\u2019s most profitable toy maker. Stockton, who joined Mattel three years ago and has overseen collapsing sales over the last five quarters, is leaving the company with immediate effect. He was not quoted in the firm\u2019s announcement. Mattel has been struggling in recent years as the company has failed to quickly adapt to children\u2019s changing demands. On Monday, Mattel said profits over the last three months of 2014 dropped 59% to $150m. Sales fell 6% to $2bn. Mattel\u2019s shares were down 3% to $27.17 at 11.30am on Monday. Stockton has been replaced by Christopher Sinclair as interim chairman and CEO. Sinclair has served on the toy company\u2019s board since 1996. \u201cMattel is an exceptional company with a great future but the board believes that it is the right time for new leadership to maximise its potential,\u201d Sinclair said. \u201cWe are committed to delivering improved growth and financial performance and remain confident in our ability to leverage our unmatched portfolio of brands, global scale and strong balance sheet as we execute on our strategic plan. \u201cWe will be working during the coming months to revitalize the business and to identify the right leadership for Mattel as it enters its next phase of growth and value creation.\u201d",

But Adzuna, which says it has come up with a way for people to calculate their \u201cmarket value\u201d, suggests now is a good time to ask for a pay rise. Adzuna co-founder Andrew Hunter says: Wages have been stagnant and consistently lagging behind inflation. That said, our data suggests that employers across the country are starting to lift the lid on rates of pay. The picture from the search engine\u2019s vacancies and salary data echoes the latest official figures showing that annual wages increased by an average of 1.8% in the year to November, the fastest pace for two years. That means wages were also finally rising faster than inflation, meaning pay rises in real terms. But again, behind the average numbers, the picture is uneven and varies by region as well as profession. The survey suggests the most dissatisfied workers are based in the east of England, where almost two-thirds of those surveyed felt underpaid. That was closely followed by the East Midlands and Scotland. Employees in the south-west were happiest with their pay, followed by the north-west and London. For anyone contemplating a change of career to secure higher pay, Adzuna has also compiled a list of sectors with the fastest-rising wages and the slowest. Biggest improvements in pay over the last 12 months: (change in average advertised salary in year to January) Trade &amp; Construction Jobs +10.4% Scientific Jobs +10.3% IT Jobs +10.2% Manufacturing Jobs +8.4% Sales Jobs +8.1% Sectors seeing stagnation / falls in pay over the last 12 months: Hospitality &amp; Catering Jobs -2.1% Energy, Oil &amp; Gas Jobs -0.55% PR &amp; Marketing Jobs -0.44% HR Jobs -1.1% Healthcare &amp; Nursing Jobs 0% \u2022 This article was amended on 6 March 2015. An earlier version claimed incorrectly in the headline and first paragraph that nurses and teachers were among the UK\u2019s unhappiest workers with regard to their pay. That error occured as a result of mistakes in information provided by Adzuna about its survey, as did several other errors in the information listed in the earlier version of the article under the subheadings \u201cUnhappiest workers\u201d and \u201cHappiest workers\u201d.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Interest rates in the UK could rise sooner than markets expect, a top Bank of England policymaker has said. Traders have pushed back expectations of interest rates rising from a record low of 0.5% because inflation has come down sharply in recent months. A hike is not priced in until halfway through next year. But there were risks that inflation could rebound sooner than thought, pushing rates up earlier than expected, one of the Bank\u2019s nine rate-setters, Kristin Forbes, said in a speech published on Monday. \u201cIf the risks that I\u2019m focusing on to our last forecasts come through, I think there is a chance that inflation will pick up faster than people had been expecting in the medium term, which then would most likely merit an increase in interest rates sooner than people are currently expecting,\u201d Forbes told the Wall Street Journal. The Bank also released a speech on Monday that American economist Forbes had given last Thursday, where she made similar warnings. She said inflation, currently at a record low of 0.5%, may overshoot the government-set target of 2.0% before the end of 2016. The Bank has a remit to set interest rates so that inflation can be brought back to target within a \u201creasonable time period\u201d. Forbes\u2019 remarks follow comments from Bank of England governor Mark Carney last week that prices would start to rise in the next two years to bring the inflation rate back to target. In her speech, Forbes listed what she sees as five keys risks around the Bank\u2019s forecast for the economy, published in November: stronger global growth than anticipated by the Bank; oil prices staying lower for longer than forecast; how big an effect a stronger pound has on the economy; faster productivity growth; and whether the Bank has been too optimistic about labour supply. Stronger global growth, and in particular stronger US growth, should support exports and demand in a number of economies, Forbes said. That, combined with a boost from lower oil prices, would mean inflation is higher than the Bank has been forecasting over the medium term and above the 2% target in 2017. But it could overshoot even sooner. The stronger pound could make inflation fall further in the near term but then bounce back faster to take the rate above 2% by the end of 2016. \u201cSeveral of the scenarios would imply a faster rate of growth and higher rate of inflation in the medium term than currently expected. These scenarios, if they occur, would imply an earlier increase in interest rates than currently expected, especially in order to ensure that any subsequent interest rate increases are slow and gradual,\u201d she said. But Forbes added that there were risks in the other direction, particularly from low oil prices and their effect on the economy. \u201cOn the other hand, some of these risks ... imply a substantially lower rate of inflation in the short term, so that even when inflation does start to pick up, it would begin from a very low level and take some time before reaching the 2% target. These two scenarios would imply that there is no urgency to start tightening monetary policy today.\u201d The Bank will publish its latest forecasts for growth and inflation in mid-February.",

That, combined with a boost from lower oil prices, would mean inflation is higher than the Bank has been forecasting over the medium term and above the 2% target in 2017.</p> <p>But it could overshoot even sooner. The stronger pound could make inflation fall further in the near term but then bounce back faster to take the rate above 2% by the end of 2016.</p> <p>\u201cSeveral of the scenarios would imply a faster rate of growth and higher rate of inflation in the medium term than currently expected. These scenarios, if they occur, would imply an earlier increase in interest rates than currently expected, especially in order to ensure that any subsequent interest rate increases are slow and gradual,\u201d she said.</p> <p>But Forbes added that there were risks in the other direction, particularly from low oil prices and their effect on the economy.</p> <p>\u201cOn the other hand, some of these risks ... imply a substantially lower rate of inflation in the short term, so that even when inflation does start to pick up, it would begin from a very low level and take some time before reaching the 2% target. These two scenarios would imply that there is no urgency to start tightening monetary policy today.\u201d</p> <p>The Bank will publish its latest forecasts for growth and inflation in mid-February.</p>",

It said the cut would save \u00a328 a year on the typical gas bill. SSE has also pledged not to increase prices for 7m customers, until July 2016 at the earliest by extending the freeze it introduced last year by six months. SSE is the fifth of the big six energy companies to reduce gas prices, following cuts from E.ON, British Gas, Scottish Power and npower. Its reduction is smaller than all those announced so far, apart from E.ON\u2019s 3.5% reduction, which took effect earlier than others on 13 January. SSE will lower prices on 30 April, whereas cuts at other companies take effect by the end of February at the latest.

SSE said the way it buys gas in wholesale markets lets it give customers greater long-term certainty than other suppliers. \u201cAlthough this can mean reductions to wholesale prices may take slightly longer to have an impact, customers know that they will benefit from price reductions without having to worry about prices going back up before July 2016,\u201d the company said. EDF is the only power company not to have announced household price reductions after the halving of the oil price cut the cost of gas that companies buy in the market. Consumer groups have called on energy suppliers to pass on more of the reduction in wholesale prices to consumers while Citizens Advice has branded the announcements as a \u201cphoney price war\u201d. The companies have said the wholesale price only makes up about half the standard gas bill. Ann Robinson, director of consumer policy at price comparison site uSwitch.com, said: \u201cIt looked as though the gas bill reductions were slowly becoming more generous, but it\u2019s disappointing that SSE has not reduced its prices further or sooner.

Growth is forecast to have slowed to 0.6% in the fourth quarter, from 0.7% in the third, according to a poll of economists by Reuters. However, Chancellor George Osborne will be able to claim credit for the strongest annual performance since the financial crisis if the latest quarterly GDP data comes in as expected on Tuesday. If predictions of a 0.6% rise are correct, it would mean the economy expanded 2.6% for the year as a whole, the best performance since 2007 and faster growth than other advanced economies. Months before the general election on 7 May, Osborne will likely seize on the annual figures as proof his \u201ceconomic plan is working\u201d. But there are already warnings that the UK is becoming over-reliant on debt-fuelled consumer spending. The coalition took office more than four years ago with a vow to rebalance the UK economy towards exports and manufacturing and away from its dependence on domestic spending. But the first official glimpse on Tuesday of how the economy performed over the final quarter is likely to show the services sector as the main engine of growth. \u201cGDP growth should have remained strong ... but may have been less broad based,\u201d predicts Samuel Tombs at the thinktank Capital Economics. \u201cThe output breakdown may show that the recovery has become entirely dependent on the services sector.\u201d Recent reports have pointed to a slowdown at the end of 2014 for both industry and construction while consumer spending appears to have held up. The latest figures from the high street last week showed sales rose in December as motorists rushed to fill up cars with cheaper petrol and food shopping was strong ahead of Christmas. Analysts see little chance of that pattern changing in coming months as continued troubles among the UK\u2019s key trading partner, the eurozone, and a slowdown in China weigh on exports. But manufacturing should get some support from lower oil prices. Meanwhile, household spending is expected to remain the key driver for the UK economy as households get some relief from low inflation, rising employment and signs of the long-awaited return of wage growth. That boost to household finances is cited in a survey published on Monday as driving a spike in spending on non-essentials. A poll by consultants Deloitte puts discretionary spending at a three-year high. Fewer people suffered a drop in income, and more said they had received a pay rise or bonus than a year ago, according to the report. People also had more to spend on treats and big ticket items because essentials such as food and petrol continued to fall in price. \u201cCategories such as hotels and restaurants or consumer technology have really benefited from consumers feeling less of a squeeze on their disposable income,\u201d said Ben Perkins, Deloitte\u2019s head of consumer business research. \u201cIn comparison, net spending on utilities and groceries is growing more slowly than consumer spending overall, a reflection of falling fuel prices at the pump and the grocery sector\u2019s intense price competitions.\u201d However, the report also found that people continued to worry about job security.",
