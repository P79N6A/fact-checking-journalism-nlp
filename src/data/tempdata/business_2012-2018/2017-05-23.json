      "bodyText": "Adani has declined to say whether it can build Australia\u2019s largest coalmine without a royalty \u201choliday\u201d from the Queensland government, which now appears in doubt after it was thwarted by an internal Labor revolt. But the Indian miner\u2019s next investment move will come after the state makes \u201ca decision [on royalties] that we can live with\u201d, a spokesman for its Australian arm said. Adani would also face another crossroads in the future if its bid for a $1bn taxpayer-funded concessional loan from the Northern Australia Infrastructure Facility foundered, the spokesman said. The Queensland government\u2019s senior figures \u2013 the premier, Annastacia Palaszczuk, the treasurer, Curtis Pitt, and the deputy premier, Jackie Trad \u2013 will broker a new arrangement to replace an ill-fated proposal that reportedly allowed Adani to defer up to $320m in royalty payments during the mine\u2019s early years. The proposal, developed by state treasury specific to Adani, was to be approved by the cabinet budget review committee, consisting of the leadership trio. But it was scrapped after opposition from the left-faction majority in Labor\u2019s cabinet, including Trad, who declared the deal would break a 2015 election promise of \u201cno royalty holiday or subsidisation of taxpayer funds for Adani\u201d. The entire cabinet will now have to sign off on its replacement, a new overarching royalties scheme for all miners in three undeveloped regions, the Galilee and Surat basins and the north-west minerals province. Whether or not any royalties pause will be offered to Adani and other miners hinges on whether enough left-faction ministers support any concession. The issue highlights the political divide the Palaszczuk government is walking between disparate support bases \u2013 those in the regions who support the 1,400-plus jobs the project would create, and those in the state capital who oppose the mine on environmental grounds. A government source said the deal would likely take its final shape in negotiations among the leadership before coming to cabinet. Adani announced on Monday it would postpone what it calls its \u201cfinal investment decision\u201d on the Carmichael mine after the company was told by the premier\u2019s office there was no cabinet ruling on its royalties offer. That decision had been slated by the board of its Indian parent company by the end of next week. Adani had flagged then investing $100m to $400m from the parent company in preconstruction works. But the deadline for the real final investment decision \u2013 the point of financial closure, when Adani clinches necessary investor backing for the $16bn project \u2013 was slated for the start of 2018. The Adani spokesman said the board\u2019s investment decision would come after a state government decision on royalties \u2013 \u201ca decision that we can live with\u201d. Asked if Adani could proceed without any royalties pause, he said: \u201cLet\u2019s wait and see what the government comes back with.\u201d It was possible that Adani may also have to postpone its financial closure deadline, depending on how long the government takes to make its decision on a royalties offer, the spokesman said. \u201cIt can affect a number of the preconstruction stage works,\u201d he said. The status of Adani\u2019s Naif bid did not affect its board investment decision because it was \u201cpart of the funding arrangements which flow after\u201d, he said. \u201cSo we get [a final investment decision] and we get all our banking components in place; if we get Naif, we\u2019re right. \u201cIf we don\u2019t get Naif, we have to make another assessment.\u201d Adani considered its royalties deal to be the final outstanding matter before the Indian board could rule on investment, the spokesman said. He said federal Labor had told the company it would support amendments on native title laws to safeguard its land access deal with traditional owners. That deal continues to be contested in courts by some of the Wangan and Jagalingou traditional owners.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Last-ditch talks are under way to avert a legal battle that would force Royal Bank of Scotland\u2019s disgraced former chief executive Fred Goodwin to give evidence at the high court. A judge hearing the case brought by thousands of shareholders claiming they were misled into buying RBS shares in April 2008 was told that the majority of them had indicated their willingness to agree a settlement with the bailedout bank. Jonathan Nash, QC for the shareholders, told the judge that there was a \u201cgood prospect\u201d that by the end of Tuesday the remaining shareholders would agree to an deal with RBS. The remarks were made as case was adjournedfor a second day by Mr Justice Hildyard who granted a second 24-hour adjournment. The much-anticipated case had been due to begin on Monday and last for 14 weeks but Hildyard had agreed to an adjournment when lawyers for the shareholders asked for time to discuss a settlement with RBS. According to reports, when Hildyard was asked for a second adjournment, he said: \u201cThere is obvious interest in the court in seeking to facilitate a full and final settlement agreeable to the parties.\u201d The judge also told the shareholders that they had to decide whether to continue their legal case against RBS. The details of the settlement being offered by RBS to avert a lengthy court room battle that would require Goodwin and other former directors of the bank to give evidence have not been confirmed. But it is thought the bailed-out bank is offering about \u00a3200m to the 9,000 private shareholders and a handful of major City institutions over their claim that they were misled during the \u00a312bn cash call. The rights issue, at the time a record-breaking fundraising, took place six months before the \u00a345bn taxpayer bailout of the Edinburgh-based bank that left shareholders nursing heavy losses. The investors are making their claim against RBS, Goodwin and three former directors, including Sir Tom McKillop, who was chairman at the time of the bailout. Goodwin has been scheduled to give evidence for two days from 8 June. If the settlement talks fail and the case goes ahead, the former RBS chief executive would be forced to account for his actions in public for the first time since February 2009, when he appeared before MPs on the Treasury select committee and offered a \u201cprofound and unqualified apology for all of the distress that has been caused\u201d. It has been reported that the businessman Trevor Hemmings, who owns Preston North End football club and is helping cover the shareholders\u2019 legal costs, is willing to accept the RBS settlement. The offer, in which the RBS chief executive, Ross McEwan, was involved, is thought to be based on 82p a share, although Reuters was reporting that investors were holding out for 100p a share. This figure amounts to about \u00a3200m, double the size of settlements reached with other groups of shareholders involved in long-running legal battles with RBS. Five shareholder groups originally brought claims, but last December, RBS announced that it had \u00a3800m to share among the various factions. It has settled with 87% of the investors. With the last group being offered about \u00a3200m, the bill for RBS would rise by about \u00a3100m. RBS has not accepted liability. Sir Howard Davies, the bank\u2019s chair, told its annual meeting this month: \u201cThe settlement does not constitute any admission of liability by the bank, but allows us to minimise material litigation expense and management distraction.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The Bank of England governor, Mark Carney, has fallen victim to an online prankster who got him to joke about one of his predecessor\u2019s supposed drinking habits. Carney was caught out by the same hoaxer who tricked the Barclays boss, Jes Staley, this month. The prankster, who uses the Twitter handle @SINON_REBORN, emailed Carney from a Hotmail account pretending to be Anthony Habgood, the chair of the Bank\u2019s court. In the exchange, posted on Twitter, Carney appears initially to fall for the prank and tentatively accepts an invitation to a \u201csoiree\u201d in June. But the governor is quick to dismiss his correspondent\u2019s message as \u201cnot appropriate at all\u201d when the impostor claims to have engaged some \u201crather dashing bar ladies\u201d for the evening. The Bank declined to comment on the exchange. It has insisted in the past that it takes online security very seriously but the prank on the nation\u2019s top central banker may raise questions about whether more precautions should be taken. While the prankster got a swift slapdown for his sexist comments, he did manage to draw the Canadian banker on the topic of morning drinking. According to the exchange as posted on Twitter, the prankster used anthonyhabgood@hotmail.com and wrote under the subject line \u201cI see reports of Jane Austen in the papers today\u201d: Apparently her face resembles that of someone who\u2019s had a \u2018bracing martini\u2019. I\u2019d prefer a large Scotch myself. Anthony Carney replied: I will drink the martini and order another two. Apparently that was Eddie George\u2019s daily in take...before lunch The comment was probably a reference to an interview given at the weekend by the former shadow chancellor Ed Balls, in which he told the Observer that at lunches, the former Bank of England governor Eddie George \u201cwould start with a martini, never eat vegetables and incredibly good clarets would appear from the vaults\u201d. Carney appeared to exercise more caution than Staley, who responded to emails sent by a \u201cJohn McFarlane\u201d, the name of the Barclays chairman. The email exchange showed Staley being told \u201cyou owe me a large Scotch\u201d after the bank\u2019s difficult annual general meeting, in which the chairman repeatedly defended the chief executive over the latter\u2019s attempts to unmask a whistleblower who had been making allegations about the previous conduct of a new recruit in the US. In the exchange, Staley appeared to lavish praise on McFarlane, who was instrumental in hiring the American chief executive in 2015.",

London, the south-east and the east of England recorded net fiscal surpluses in 2016 \u2013 in order words, tax receipts exceeded public spending on a per-head basis. The rest of the UK was in deficit, says the Office for National Statistics in its first such regional breakdown. Some differences were substantial. At one end of the scale, London showed a surplus of just over \u00a33,000 per person \u2013 the difference between revenues of \u00a315,756 per head and spending of \u00a312,686. Northern Ireland had the biggest deficit \u2013 about \u00a35,400 per person \u2013 and Wales was next at \u00a34,500. Regional differences are to be expected, of course. And, remember, the data doesn\u2019t seek to reflect factors such as a brain-drain towards the capital, which might affect one\u2019s view of the extent to which London and south-east can be said to \u201csubsidise\u201d the rest of the UK. The most important statistic is that the UK, as a whole, has had a net fiscal deficit every year since 2003. Yet two conclusions seem clear. First, if Brexit presents challenges for London, with its heavy weighting towards financial services, the problem is the rest of the UK\u2019s too. As matters stand, London and the south-east are the UK\u2019s cash cow. Second, an independent Scotland would face hard choices. The deficit per head in Scotland was \u00a32,824 last year, according to the ONS data. To reduce that figure as a standalone nation, taxes would have to rise or spending would have to fall, other factors being equal. That makes the currency question \u2013 one of the central debates in the 2014 referendum \u2013 critical. Back then, the Scottish National party said a post-independence Scotland would continue to use the pound sterling. The economic logic looked weak at the time, and remains so: Scotland would be embracing a currency union that could damage its own competitiveness at the moment of separation and make balancing the budget harder, especially if the oil price was low. The ONS data is published free of vulgar political interpretation, obviously. But that \u00a32,824 per head deficit figure for Scotland shouldn\u2019t be ignored. If another referendum lies around the corner, voters deserve to be told whether an independent Scotland would continue with the pound, use its own currency or join the euro. There are pros and cons to all those options \u2013 but clarity is essential. Nationwide has no mutual interests with Co-op The natural home for the troubled Co-operative Bank would be the Nationwide Building Society, many would say. The Nationwide is a mutual. Like the Co-op Bank, it proclaims its social purpose. And it has experience of takeovers, having absorbed many laggards from within the building society sector over the years. Regulators at the Bank of England would probably be delighted by such a union. From their point of view, the capital woes of the Co-op Bank are the source of a small but annoyingly persistent headache. There\u2019s just one problem with the takeover theory: there\u2019s nothing in it for the Nationwide. Its profits fell last year from \u00a31.28bn to \u00a31.05bn under pressure from low interest rates, but the result was perfectly respectable. As the chief executive, Joe Garner, points out, the society is not in the profit maximisation game. It is a member-owned organisation with some freedom to manage its profits upwards or downwards, depending on how it wants to balance incentives between savers and borrowers. As long as profits continue to arrive around the \u00a31bn mark, capital can be replenished and investment can continue. Why mess with this formula? One might say the Co-op Bank\u2019s 4 million retail customers would be a nice addition. So they would be, but they would arrive with unwanted baggage, such as the Co-op Bank\u2019s \u201clegacy\u201d issues from its ill-fated Britannia merger in 2009 plus commercial and local authority lending operations. The Nationwide isn\u2019t interested in such distractions. It should continue to steer clear. Bank\u2019s cyber-defences don\u2019t rate highly When confronted by an email hoaxer, the governor of the Bank of the England made less of a fool of himself than the chief executive of Barclays. This news is mildly reassuring. It is alarming, however, that a mischievous web designer can reach Mark Carney by using a humble Hotmail account.

Regulators have bigger threats in mind than the danger that the governor might get duped in a prank but the Bank\u2019s defences, as Carney might put it, seem \u201cnot appropriate at all\u201d.",

      "bodyText": "Most traders had their minds on other things than the markets after the horrific events in Manchester. So business was rather subdued throughout the day, with the FTSE 100 managing to stay in positive territory for most of the day, only to slip back after a late bounce in the pound. Meanwhile the FTSE 250 edged to a new closing high, while European markets also ended higher. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished down 11.05 points or 0.15% at 7485.29 Germany\u2019s Dax rose 0.31% to 12,659.15 France\u2019s Cac closed up 0.47% at 5348.16 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB climbed 0.46% to 21,415.74 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended up 1.14% at 10,916.3 In Greece, the Athens market fell 0.7% to 783.03 following the overnight failure of the country to win a debt deal with creditors On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently Here are some new figures from the ONS showing a regional breakdown of the UK\u2019s public finances. Larry Elliott writes: London\u2019s thriving economy generates a \u00a326.5bn surplus that is recycled by the government to provide financial help to Britain\u2019s less well-off regions, according to an official breakdown of the public finances. The first attempt by the Office for National Statistics to break down the UK\u2019s budget deficit by region has demonstrated the importance of the capital and highlighted how taxes and public spending are used to narrow the north-south divide. Experimental data from the ONS showed that only three regions of the UK \u2013 London, the south-east and the east of England \u2013 ran a budget surplus in the 2015-16 financial year, the latest year for which figures are available. The full story is here: The markets are looking a little lacklustre at the moment. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said: The market became more subdued as Tuesday went on, with little to engender any significant movement. As it was earlier in the day, the afternoon\u2019s main data-focus was on the latest set of PMIs, this time from the US. They ended up cancelling each other out, however; the manufacturing reading unexpectedly dropped from 53.2 to 52.5 month-on-month, but with the services figure jumping to a higher than forecast 54.0. This did little for the Dow Jones, which started the session up 10 or so points, roughly a quarter of what was promised by the futures. The Eurozone lost some of its lustre after lunch, the DAX and CAC seeing their growth shrink back to 0.1% and 0.3% respectively. Even the previously dominant euro slowed down; the currency now sits flat against the pound \u2013 having been up as much as 0.3% \u2013 and actually down 0.1% against the dollar. As for the UK, investors\u2019 minds were understandably elsewhere. The FTSE nudged 0.1% higher, maintaining a 7500-plus performance, while the pound fared a bit worse, clawing back its losses against the euro but dipping 0.2% against the greenback. Still with the US, and a poor set of housing figures, albeit after a strong performance in the previous month. New single family home sales dropped 11.4% in April to a seasonally adjusted rate of 569,000 units, down from a nine and a half year high in March. Analysts had been expecting a much smaller decline of 1.5%. And away again from the levity, and some data from the US showing the country\u2019s economy continues to head in the right direction, helped by the service sector. Markit\u2019s initial composite purchasing manager\u2019s index climbed from 53.2 in April to 53.9 in May. (A reading above 50 indicates expansion). Within that, manufacturing fell from 52.8 in April to 52.5 in May, below expectations of a figure of 53. But the services PMI rose from 53.1 to 54 in May, above forecasts of a flat reading at 53.1. Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit said: Growth of US business activity gained a little momentum for a second successive month in May, but the upturn still looks somewhat underwhelming. Historical comparisons of the PMI against GDP indicates that the PMI is running at a level broadly consistent with the economy growing at a 0.4% quarterly rate (1.5% annualized). Actual second quarter GDP numbers are likely to be considerably stronger, in part reflecting seasonality in the official data and the weak first quarter. May saw an encouraging upturn in service sector growth to the fastest so far this year, buoyed by rising domestic demand. Manufacturers, on the other hand, reported the smallest rise in production since last September amid lacklustre export sales. There were mixed signals for the outlook. Optimism about the year ahead fell slightly, but hiring remained reassuringly solid, thanks to a step- up in service sector recruitment. The survey is indicative of non-farm payroll growth of approximately 160,000. Average prices charged for goods and services meanwhile showed one of the largest rises in the past two years. The strengthening of business activity growth and rise in prices will add to expectations of the Fed hiking interest rates again in June. It really isn\u2019t a good day for levity, but Mark Carney, governor of the Bank of England, has fallen for an email prankster. The governor was deceived by a hoaxer pretending to be Anthony Habgood, chair of the BoE\u2019s court. In the exchange, \u201cHabgood\u201d starts by tweeting about claims that the Bank\u2019s new \u00a310 note has an \u201cairbrushed\u201d picture of Jane Austen, before inviting the governor to a drinks party. Carney appears to be initially taken in \u2013 joking about former deputy governor Eddie George\u2019s appetite for drink. But he then slaps \u201cHabgood\u201d down, after the conversation took a sleazy turn with talk of \u201cdashing bar ladies\u201d. Does it matter? Yes, as it shows that the Bank\u2019s email security isn\u2019t tight enough. That\u2019s not terribly forgivable, as Barclays CEO Jes Staley fell to the same hoaxster last week. Following in the steps of Europe, US markets have moved higher in early trading, ahead of President Trump\u2019s first full budget plan. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 29 points or 0.14%, while both the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq Composite opened around 0.2% higher. Over in Athens the government spokesman has challenged the German finance minister\u2019s view, and suggested Berlin is responsible for the failure to reach a comprehensive deal that would also include debt relief. From Athens, Helena Smith reports: Without singling out Germany by name, Dimitris Tzanakopoulos told reporters: \u201cSome cannot say \u2018yes\u2019 to reforms...but no to the restructuring of the debt.\u201d \u201cThe solution presented yesterday corresponded neither to the targets that had recently been set nor the sacrifices of the Greek people.\u201d That\u2019s a reference to the extra creditor-mandated pension cuts and tax hikes the Greek government pushed through parliament last week. Tzanakopoulos repeated that both the IMF and Berlin remained locked in disagreement over growth projections - regarded as vital to calculating debt relief - and its ability to achieve a high 3.5 % primary budget surplus in the years ahead. \u201cThe main difference between the IMF and the German finance ministry has to do with the growth projections and primary surpluses after 2023.\u201d Germany\u2019s finance minister, Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble, has just told reporters in Brussels that the IMF \u2018proved to be difficult\u2019 during last night\u2019s Eurogroup meeting. Speaking after a meeting with EU finance ministers, Sch\u00e4uble insisted that Germany wasn\u2019t blocking a deal to release fresh aid to Greece, and just \u2018sticking to the rules\u2019. If everything goes well, he added, a deal could be reached in three weeks (at the next Eurogroup meeting). Via Reuters. Guardian Business is launching a daily email.

In statements released by the finance ministry he said: \u201cI\u2019m quite confident that if all sides are in a mood of compromise, it should not be beyond the wit of man to find that compromise within three weeks. It does mean that all sides will need to compromise a bit.\u201d Tsakalotos said progress had been made on the policy package Greece must adopt and on the fiscal front, with creditors agreeing that Athens should achieve a primary fiscal surplus of 3.5% for four years once the current bailout ends in late 2018. But the main opposition party, the centre right New Democracy, slammed prime minister Alexis Tsipras and his lelftist-led government saying both were subjecting Greeks to \u201cfairytales.\u201d ND spokesman Vasillis Kikillas told Skai channel: \u201cHow many fairytales will Greeks be subjected to? Six Eurogroups have elapsed and Mr Tsipras keeps telling us that the second review and agreement has been concluded. \u201cInstead of getting the loan disbursement and closing the deal, he has got nothing and burdened Greeks with measures worth \u20ac14bn. Neither has the review closed, neither has he got the loan disbursement and of course there is not a word about the debt.\u201d The Athens stock market has fallen amid disappointment that the eurogroup didn\u2019t unlock Greece\u2019s next bailout payment last night. The benchmark ATG index is down 1% at 780 points, with bank shares leading the selloff. Shares had rallied recently, hitting an 21-month high this month, on hopes that Greece would receive vital bailout loans. So there\u2019s obvious anxiety that ministers are returning home from Brussels empty handed, with the bailout review still incomplete. Greek bonds are also suffering, with yields (interest rates) jumping as investors sell the debt, pushing down prices. Other European stock markets are having a better morning, with gains in France and Germany following today\u2019s strong PMI reports. It\u2019s a rather subdued day in the City, though, with workers preoccupied by the awful attack in Manchester. The pound has dipped a little, to $1.2963, which helped to nudge the FTSE 100 a bit higher. But I don\u2019t think anyone\u2019s heart is really in it today. Marc Ostwald of ADM Investor Services sums up the mood on the trading floors. Another barbaric terrorist attack UK will cast a very long shadow over the UK general election (for which campaigning has been understandably suspended), the public and financial markets, and renders all else rather moot. Britain\u2019s retailers became more anxious about trading conditions this month. That\u2019s according to the CBI\u2019s monthly report on the sector, which found that sentiment fell at the fastest rate since 2012. John Hawksworth, PwC chief economist, says today\u2019s UK public finances paint a mixed picture: On the positive side, the estimate budget deficit for 2016/17 as a whole was revised down by more than \u00a33 billion due to higher tax receipts and lower spending than initially estimated last month. The deficit last year was only around 2.5% of GDP, similar to pre-crisis levels and moving closer to levels that would be sustainable in the long run. \u201cOn the other hand, public borrowing in April 2017 was \u00a310.4 billion, around \u00a31.2 billion higher than the same month last year. We should not read too much into a preliminary estimate for a single month, but it is consistent with the broader picture painted by the OBR in March when they predicted that the budget deficit could widen again this financial year as some favourable timing effects on both tax and spending in 2016/17 were reversed in 2017/18. Hawksworth adds: Whoever forms the next government will still need to make some tough choices on tax and spending in the longer term, as the recent debate on social care shows.\u201d Today\u2019s public finance report also shows how Britain\u2019s national debt has swelled since the financial crisis struck, both in cash terms (in blue) and as a share of national output (the red line) Sam Tombs of Pantheon Economics has tweeted an interesting chart from today\u2019s UK public finances. It shows how growth in UK tax receipts has slowed in the last couple of months (one reason the deficit went up in April). The jump in Britain\u2019s budget deficit last month highlights the challenge facing the next government. So warns Ross Campbell, public sector director at ICAEW (which represents chartered accountants), who calls April\u2019s net borrowing \u201cprecariously high\u201d. Campbell adds: The amount of interest Government pays because of its growing debt, projected to be \u00a346 billion annually in 2017/2018, is \u00a37 billion more than in the previous financial year. Instead of loading up the UK\u2019s credit card with no comprehensive strategy to pay off these financial obligations, this money could be used to tackle key issues across all party manifestos, such as social care, education, and intelligent infrastructure plans.\u201d PUBLIC FINANCES: Britain borrowed more than expected to balance the nation\u2019s books last month. The UK budget deficit jumped to \u00a310.4bn in April, new figures from the Office for National Statistics show, some \u00a31.2bn more than a year ago. That\u2019s more than the most pessimistic City forecasts (the consensus was for a deficit of around \u00a38.9bn). It\u2019s an unimpressive start to Britain\u2019s 2017-18 financial year. VAT receipts stalled in April, compared with a year ago, while stamp duty income fell. But Britain brought in more money through income tax (up 1%), corporation tax (up 7%) and fuel duty. In better news, Britain\u2019s deficit in the previous financial year (2016-2017) has been revised down by \u00a33.3bn, to \u00a348.7bn. But this still leaves Britain with a national debt of \u00a31.7224 trillion, of 82.6% of GDP. Alex Lydall, head of dealing at Foenix Partners, says this morning\u2019s strong PMI report shows that Europe\u2019s economy continues to impress. Momentum for the single currency has been obvious with the euro peaking at 8-month highs against the US dollar at a time where political threats are quickly diminishing. Populist voting has been quashed in both the Netherlands and France, with the main conundrum for [ECB president] Mario Draghi, low inflation, seemingly also disappearing as levels are very close to the 2% target. At a time where Trump is continually sending shockwaves across US markets, and the UK in the midst of an election, things in the eurozone appear somewhat settled. Julien Lafargue, European Equities Strategist at JP Morgan, believes the European Central Bank will resist pressure to start tightening monetary policy. The Eurozone\u2019s growth trajectory remains very supportive, fuelling expectations that the European Central Bank will have to adjust its stance soon, maybe as early as June. However, despite some green shoots, inflation dynamics remain relatively subdued and the recent appreciation of the Euro was cited by some survey respondents as a drag on new business. A tightening of monetary policy would only reinforce that trend and as such, the ECB may have to wait before signalling that the end of its extremely accommodative policy is in sight. It\u2019s official: Europe\u2019s economy continues to rattle along at its fastest rate since the debt crisis began. Markit\u2019s eurozone PMI, which tracks company growth across the eurozone, has just come in at 56.8 in May, matching April\u2019s figure, which was a six-year high. Any reading over 50 shows growth, so this report suggests that the European economy is enjoying its sunniest patch since 2011. Markit reports that manufacturing firms led the way, while overall business optimism has hit a joint five-year high. And job creation is now running close to a 10-year high, boosting hopes that Europe is finally fixing its unemployment crisis. This is only a \u2018flash\u2019 reading, so we only have details for Germany (here) and France (here)-- which both posted the best readings since 2011, of course. Markit reports that growth eased across the rest of the single currency area but remained close to a ten-year high. Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit, says today\u2019s PMI data suggests eurozone growth is \u2018impressively strong\u2019. Business activity is expanding at its fastest rate for six years so far in the second quarter, consistent with 0.6- 0.7% GDP growth. The consensus forecast of 0.4% second quarter growth could well prove overly pessimistic if the PMI holds its elevated level in June. Capacity is being strained by the strength of demand, with backlogs of work showing one of the largest increases in the past six years. Job creation has surged to the second-highest rate in nearly a decade as firms seek to expand capacity and meet rising demand. The German PMI figures have also impressed economists. Here\u2019s ING\u2019s Carsten Brzeski.... ...Mike van Dulken of Accendo Markets... ...and Pepijn Bergsen of the Economist Intelligence Unit. Germany\u2019s private sector is also powering ahead, in another encouraging sign for the eurozone. The German manufacturing PMI has jumped to 59.4 this month, up from 58.2 in April. That\u2019s a seriously solid number -- the highest in 73 months -- indicating that the sector grew at a faster rate. Service sector growth dipped a little (the PMI slipped to 55.2 from 55.4), but the overall composite PMI jumped to its highest since 2011. German companies reported that output and new business rose this month, with goods producers seeing the biggest rise in new export orders in seven years. Trevor Balchin, senior economist at IHS Markit, explains: \u201cThe flash PMI data for May signalled no let-up in German economic growth, with the headline output index reaching its highest level in over six years. The index has trended at 57.0 over April-May, pointing to the strongest quarterly expansion since Q2 2011. Manufacturing continued its impressive performance with output, new orders and backlogs all growing at the sharpest rates in over six years, and export expansion hitting a seven-year record. Cost pressures at manufacturers also eased noticeably in May, but remained strong overall. \u201cThe only blot on Germany\u2019s copybook in May was a further solid but unspectacular rise in service sector new business, reflected in another decline in the volume of outstanding work in the sector. Economists are impressed by France\u2019s strong private sector growth this month. Bloomberg\u2019s Maxime Sbaihi says it shows the economy strengthened this quarter (after growing by only 0.3% in Q1). This is from Fred Ducrozet of Swiss bank Pictet: We have encouraging news from France this morning. French companies are growing at their fastest pace in six years right now, according to the latest healthcheck from data firm Markit. France\u2019s services PMI, which measures activity across the sector, has jumped to 58.0, from 56.7 in April. That shows that growth accelerated during the month. Companies took on more staff this month, at the fastest rate in 69 months, to help tackle a steady increase in new business. Factory growth dipped slightly, but the overall \u2018composite PMI\u2019 still rose to its highest level since the eurozone debt crisis began in 2011. It suggests that France\u2019s recovery is continuing; a welcome boost to Emmanuel Macron as he gets to grips with the presidency. Alex Gill, Economist at IHS Markit says there is \u201cstrong growth momentum\u201d in the French private sector. \u201cThe acceleration was driven by the dominant service sector, buoyed by strong client demand and the sharpest round of job creation since August 2011. Meanwhile, the rate of output growth in the manufacturing sector remained marked but eased from April amid a weaker rise in new business, linked, in part, to a strengthened euro. \u201cThe numbers continue to paint a positive picture of the French private sector economy. Furthermore, with May\u2019s conclusion to the presidential elections, the road looks set fair for future growth. However, eyes will now turn to June\u2019s legislative elections as a next potential stumbling block.\u201d Last night\u2019s talks failed partly because the eurogroup and the IMF can\u2019t agree how large a budget surplus Greece should run. From Brussels, my colleague Jennifer Rankin explains: At the heart of the dispute is a demand that Greece run a budget surplus equivalent to 3.5% of GDP. The European side thinks Greece can hit this target in 2018, but the IMF has long argued that any country with high unemployment, (currently 23% in Greece) would struggle to meet such demanding fiscal targets. In a sign of a possible concession from both sides, Dijsselbloem said there had been \u201cfull agreement that the 3.5% primary surplus should remain for five years\u201d and eventually fall, although he did not specify a figure. Speaking about Greece\u2019s debt sustainability, Dijsselbloem said there was a gap in expectations between the eurozone and the IMF. \u201cWe need to close that [gap] by looking at additional options or adjusting our expectations. Both are possible and both should be done.\u201d Here\u2019s her report: Greek bonds are weakening in early trading as the City react to the lack of progress at yesterday\u2019s eurogroup meeting. The yield, or interest rate, on Greece\u2019s benchmark 10-year bonds has jumped to 5.73%, up from 5.6% last night. That means traders are demanding an extra premium to hold the debt. However, it\u2019s a fairly modest move -- and still below the 7% \u2018danger zone\u2019 that shows a country is in peril. Also, as Greece is still in a bailout, it doesn\u2019t actually need to borrow from the markets at these rates today. Welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Greece\u2019s long-running debt drama is heating up again after the country\u2019s creditors failed to reach a deal to unlock the next instalment of its bailout loans. Despite talking until almost midnight in Brussels, eurozone finance ministers couldn\u2019t agree on debt relief measures for Athens. The deadlock means Greece still hasn\u2019t received the fresh loans it needs before July, when it faces large loan repayments. Instead, the can has been kicked a little way down the road to June 15th, when the eurogroup meets again. Eurogroup president Jeroen Dijsselbloem told reporters that, while Greece had made \u2018huge progress\u2019, it still hasn\u2019t taken enough actions to qualify for its next aid tranche. Striking an optimistic note, Dijsselbloem declared: \u201cI\u2019m sure we can be successful if we take a little more time.\u201d However, there is concern that the International Monetary Fund still hasn\u2019t agreed to support the bailout -- which was originally agreed in summer 2015. Also coming up today 8am to 9am BST: Data firm Markit are releasing their latest PMI surveys, showing how Europe\u2019s manufacturing and service sector companies are faring this morning. 9.30am: The UK\u2019s public finances for April are published, showing how much Britain borrowed last month. Economists expect a deficit of between \u00a37bn and \u00a310bn RBC Capital Markets say: It will be difficult to make inferences about the state of the public finances from the first month of data in the new fiscal year. In the context of a full year target for the deficit of \u00a358.3bn in 2017-18, we would expect the April borrowing requirement to have been around \u00a310bn. The general election is scheduled for 8 June, so this of course presents scope for subsequent changes to existing plans, even if they are modest ones in the event of a Conservative victory, as we explored in a recent publication. In any case, it will be more appropriate to make a more thorough assessment of the fiscal situation once the election is out of the way and we know the extent of any changes in economic strategy. 11am: The CBI releases its UK retail sales report for May",

      "bodyText": "London\u2019s thriving economy generates a \u00a326.5bn surplus that is recycled by the government to provide financial help to Britain\u2019s less well-off regions, according to an official breakdown of the public finances. The first attempt by the Office for National Statistics to break down the UK\u2019s budget deficit by region has demonstrated the importance of the capital and highlighted how taxes and public spending are used to narrow the north-south divide. Experimental data from the ONS showed that only three regions of the UK \u2013 London, the south-east and the east of England \u2013 ran a budget surplus in the 2015-16 financial year, the latest year for which figures are available. Every Londoner provided \u00a33,070 more in tax revenues than they received in public spending, while people living in the south-east ran a surplus of \u00a31,670 per head. The east of England turned a small deficit in 2014-15 into a surplus of \u00a3242 per head in 2015-16. By contrast, spending exceeded tax revenues by \u00a35,440 per head in Northern Ireland and by \u00a33,820 in the orth-east. Scotland, which has seen its public finances badly affected by the plunge in global oil prices, ran a deficit of \u00a32,830 a head. The ONS figures show that London has recovered rapidly from the financial crisis of 2007-08, which wiped out the region\u2019s fiscal surplus of close to \u00a325bn a year. The latest figures show London even more strongly in the black than it was before the crash, with a surplus up from \u00a318bn to \u00a326.5bn in the past two years. Tax receipts per head in London of \u00a315,750 were almost double those in the two regions raising the least revenue \u2013 Wales at \u00a37,980 and the north-east at \u00a38,200. Northern Ireland and Scotland attracted the highest expenditure per head, at \u00a314,020 and \u00a313,050 respectively, with the lowest expenditure per person in the south-east and east of England at \u00a310,580 and \u00a310,590 per head. Despite the tax revenues generated by London, the south-east and the east of England, the UK ran a deficit of just over \u00a372bn in 2015-16 \u2013 or \u00a31,100 per head. The ONS said the size of the deficit had narrowed to below \u00a350bn in 2016-17, although the consumer-driven slowdown in spending since the start of the year meant the shortfall for the first month of the current financial year was more than \u00a31bn up on April 2016. Analysts said the weakness of VAT receipts were evidence of the more difficult environment for consumers during a period when prices have been rising and wage growth has been stuck at 2%. The CBI\u2019s latest health check of the retail sector \u2013 its monthly distributive trades survey \u2013 found that the boost to spending seen in April was short-lived. Of the 117 retailers questioned, 29% said sales were higher in May than a year earlier, while 27% said they were lower. The balance of +2 percentage points compared with +38 points in April. Alpesh Paleja, the CBI\u2019s principal economist, said: \u201cRetail sales flattened out this month, as the bounce in April unwound. It\u2019s clear that households are increasingly feeling the pinch, as rising inflation pushes down on real earnings. Taken together with higher import cost pressures from a weaker pound, this is creating a challenging environment for retailers.\u201d The ONS said the \u00a310.4bn deficit in April was \u00a31.2bn higher than in the same month a year earlier. City analysts had been expecting the deficit to fall to \u00a38.9bn. Annual spending growth of almost 6% exceeded a rise of nearly 4% in tax receipts, reflecting the slowdown in the economy\u2019s growth rate from 0.7% in the final three months of 2016 to 0.3% in the first quarter of 2017. Borrowing in 2016-17 was lowered by a number of one-off factors that will not be repeated this year. As a result, the Office for Budget Responsibility has forecast that the deficit will rise to \u00a358bn in 2017-18. The OBR said the ONS estimate for April relied heavily on forecasts and the total was likely to be revised later. There was better news for the chancellor, Philip Hammond, from the ONS\u2019s revisions to the deficit in 2016-17, which was cut by \u00a33bn to \u00a349bn \u2013 the lowest since the economy was close to on the brink of recession in 2007-08.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "A group of suppliers owed millions of pounds by the collapsed fashion retailer Jaeger is considering taking legal action against its former owners. The companies, which include the Portuguese clothing supplier Calvelex, had tried to mount a rescue bid after Jaeger entered administration last month but found they could not buy the business because the rights to use the name had been sold to a mystery buyer. \u201cWe were very disappointed with this situation and question the thinking behind selling the intellectual property of the Jaeger brand name before the company went into administration since without it the value to potential bidders would be greatly reduced,\u201d said the Calvelex boss, C\u00e9sar Ara\u00fajo, who is leading the consortium. Ara\u00fajo said the group was considering other options, including the possibility of \u201ccourt action to examine the actions of the company directors and the former owners of Jaeger\u201d. Jaeger, which employed almost 700 people, collapsed into administration last month. So far administrators have closed 20 of its 46 stores, making more than 200 staff redundant. Fashion retailers are facing tough trading conditions as Britons stay away from the high street. Several thousand retail jobs are at risk as Store Twenty One, the value fashion chain, and the owner of clothing brands Jacques Vert, Windsmoor and Eastex face a financial crunch. Jaeger was owned by Jon Moulton\u2019s private equity firm Better Capital for five years. In its heyday, Jaeger dressed Audrey Hepburn and Marilyn Monroe but more recently it had struggled to turn a profit on a competitive high street. After spending several years trying to revive the retailer\u2019s fortunes, Better Capital hoisted a for sale sign at the start of this year. A buyer failed to emerge and, at the end of March, Better Capital sold Jaeger\u2019s debt for \u00a37m to a buyer who has been named in reports as Edinburgh Woollen Mill owner, Philip Day, who bought Austin Reed out of administration last year. However, the identity of the buyer has not been officially confirmed. Ten days later the administrators were called in. The owner of Jaeger\u2019s debts is a secured creditor so ranks ahead of other parties, such as suppliers and landlords, in the queue to be repaid from the proceeds of the administration. Last year, Jaeger\u2019s sales fell from \u00a384.2m to \u00a378.4m and it made a \u00a35.4m pre-tax loss, according to accounts filed at Companies House. In the accounts, which were signed off on 13 July 2016, the directors said Better Capital had provided an undertaking to provide financial support for at least another 12 months from that date. Asked about the threat of legal action, Moulton told the Guardian that Better Capital had gone to great lengths to find a buyer for Jaeger. \u201cExtensive efforts were made to find a buyer and buyers certainly had a chance to bid in any format,\u201d he said. \u201cThe transaction was effectively to sell control of Jaeger, including its brand, and was done without insolvency. Any insolvency actions lie with the [Better Capital] fund\u2019s successor.\u201d Ara\u00fajo is also calling on the government to review the protection offered by insolvency laws as, after a string of retailer collapses, it was becoming increasingly difficult for international suppliers to do business in the UK. \u201cA sale of secured debt should have to be disclosed to the creditors generally,\u201d he said. \u201cMany suppliers believe that it is high time the British government urgently undertake a review of the laws relating to UK insolvency to provide a more ethical, moral and level playing field that gives all creditors access to information and the opportunity to have input into the future of companies in administration.\u201d",

In its heyday, Jaeger dressed Audrey Hepburn and Marilyn Monroe but more recently it had struggled to turn a profit on a competitive high street.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The world\u2019s major oil countries will almost certainly extend production cuts by a further nine months at a crunch meeting this week, though they are thought highly unlikely to toughen the curbs. A landmark deal by Opec and non-Opec members, including Russia, to reduce output by 1.8m barrels a day and shore up the oil price, is due to expire at the end of June. The agreement last November pushed the price of oil up to $50 to $55 a barrel for the past few months, up from the depths of $35 to $50 across much of 2016, when Opec\u2019s annual revenues reached lows not seen since 2004. But when oil ministers meet in Vienna on Thursday, where they are expected to agree a Saudi Arabia and Russia-backed nine-month extension to the cuts, their best immediate hope is that prices stay stable in the face of an oil glut. \u201cThey have to renew, otherwise prices would collapse,\u201d said Joe McMonigle of US investment research firm Hedgeye. \u201cSome people are floating, \u2018Oh there could be deeper cuts.\u2019 That\u2019s nearly impossible for most Opec members, even the Saudis.\u201d While most analysts view deeper cuts as unlikely, several expect the oil price to creep up to about $60 later this year as supply and demand rebalances. Alan Gelder, an expert at oil analysts Wood Mackenzie, said: \u201cDeepening cuts requires almost a renegotiation [on last year\u2019s agreement], whereas an extension is relatively administratively easy to do.\u201d Opec and allies seem relatively unified on the nine-month extension, Gelder added, judging from an absence of \u201cunhappy rumblings\u201d ahead of the meeting. Iraq, Qatar and UAE are among club members who have publicly supported an extension. Iran could throw a spanner in the works, as its state-owned oil company ratified a plan this week that would increase production by 8% by March 2018. One key factor for Saudi Arabia, as well as propping up state income over the short run \u2013 it accounts for one-third of Opec revenue \u2013 is the stock market listing for its national oil company. The initial public offering (IPO) of Aramco is expected some time in 2018, and its backers\u2019 hopes for a colossal $2tn valuation hinge on a strong oil price. \u201cA big macro change is the Aramco IPO driving Saudi policy,\u201d McMonigle said. The asset management firm Bernstein said: \u201cAvoiding an oil price crash in the run-up to the IPO will be another key factor in decision making.\u201d \u201cThe first imperative for the Saudis [with last year\u2019s deal] was they needed to bring some order to their finances,\u201d said Neil Atkinson of the International Energy Agency. \u201cBut as far as Saudi is concerned, yes, the Aramco IPO is a factor.\u201d Ironically, the country that holds the key to the success of the Opec deal may be one not at the table: the US. The IEA has twice raised its forecasts for US oil production this year, as shale producers in Texas and New Mexico ramp up output to exploit the recovering oil price. \u201cToday the most closely watched data point on the supply side is US crude production,\u201d said the Paris-based agency. The US energy statistics agency, the EIA, forecasts domestic oil production will be 1m barrels a day higher by December compared with a year before \u2013 a huge increase that would offset more than half of the Opec cuts. \u201cWhat you can say is the role of US tight oil has reduced the influence of Opec. But Opec still has a significant influence,\u201d said Gelder, whose opinion was echoed by several other analysts. However, there are constraints on how fast the US oil industry can grow, even off the back of an oil price made buoyant by Opec\u2019s deal. Although the number of US rigs has grown to 901 from 404 this time last year \u2013 a rate of one added every 17 hours since last May \u2013 the cheapest rigs will have been put back to work first, meaning costs will be increasing for shale drillers. \u201cThere may be constraints, be it availability of equipment and crew,\u201d said Atkinson. On Tuesday, the White House sent oil prices sliding after it said in a budget to Congress that it wanted to sell half the US\u2019s 688m barrel emergency oil stockpile, starting in 2018. If a deal is agreed in Vienna on Thursday afternoon, one of the key numbers to watch will be the percentage of production that complies with the cuts. Since curbs began in January, compliance has been at 96%, historically high and well above the maximum of around 80% seen in previous Opec cuts. During past reductions by the oil club, states have traditionally responded to rising oil prices by upping their production and becoming less compliant \u2013 but experts think this cycle is different. Atkinson said that while in the past Opec countries were sitting on significant spare production capacity, that is no longer the case: \u201cThe difference is today very few countries could significantly increase their production even if they wanted to.\u201d",

    "webTitle": "No bailout funds for Greece as eurozone finance chiefs fail to agree deal", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Eurozone finance ministers have failed to agree a debt relief plan for Greece, raising the prospect of a summer crisis for the single currency bloc if Athens misses a loan repayment. A meeting of the eurozone\u2019s 19 finance ministers broke up late on Monday night, amid a row with the International Monetary Fund about Greece\u2019s debt burden. The standoff came just hours after France and Germany pledged to deepen co-operation in the single currency and seize Brexit opportunities for their banking industries. After more than eight hours of talks in Brussels, Greece\u2019s creditors \u2013 the eurozone members states and the IMF \u2013 were unable to bridge their differences on Greece\u2019s ability to repay its debts in the long run. \u201cWe were very close and we were just unable to manage it tonight,\u201d said Jeroen Dijsselbloem, the Dutch finance minister, who chaired the meeting. He said he hoped for a deal at the next eurozone meeting on 15 June. The eurozone-IMF standoff is the final obstacle to Greece unlocking a tranche of bailout funds that will let it repay \u20ac7.3bn (\u00a36.3bn) of loans due to be paid in July. The EU agreed an \u20ac86bn rescue package for Greece in July 2015, an unprecedented third bailout that stopped the country from crashing out of the eurozone. Although the headline figure has been approved, Greece needs to carry out scores of detailed reforms before receiving the cash, which is paid in instalments. It secured \u20ac10.3bn last May, but the latest payment has been held up for months. It appeared the way was clear earlier in May when the Greek government agreed to extra pension cuts and tax increases demanded by creditors. However, a dispute between creditors has become a major stumbling block. Northern European countries do not want to sign off cheques for Greece unless the IMF agrees to be part of the third bailout. Countries such as Germany and the Netherlands think the IMF will add rigour to the programme and fear the EU institutions will be too soft on Athens. But the IMF has so far refused to get involved in Greece\u2019s third bailout because officials think the country\u2019s debts cannot be managed in the long-run. The Washington-based fund has repeatedly said it is looking for \u201ca credible strategy to restore debt sustainability\u201d. At the heart of the dispute is a demand that Greece run a budget surplus equivalent to 3.5% of GDP. The European side thinks Greece can hit this target, but the IMF has long argued that any country with high unemployment, (currently 23% in Greece) would struggle to meet such demanding fiscal targets over decades. In a sign of a possible concession, Dijsselbloem said there had been \u201cfull agreement that the 3.5% primary surplus should remain for five years\u201d and eventually fall, although he did not specify a figure. The IMF continues to insist anything higher than a 1.5% surplus is not credible: its officials are urging the eurozone to be realistic about Greece\u2019s ability to keep a tight cap on public spending over decades. Speaking about Greece\u2019s debt sustainability, Dijsselbloem said there was a gap in expectations between the eurozone and the IMF. He said: \u201cWe need to close that [gap] by looking at additional options or adjusting our expectations. Both are possible and both should be done.\u201d Poul Thomsen, the head of the IMF\u2019s European department, said Greece had adopted \u201ca much more growth friendly-programme\u201d, but made clear the other creditors would have to give way on debt relief before the fund got on board. \u201cI am happy to say that we think we have a staff level-agreement on policy,\u201d he told journalists on Tuesday. \u201cThis needs to be supplemented with a credible package on debt relief. Here we are making progress, there is no doubt about that, but we are not quite there yet.\u201d He wants to see \u201cmore realism\u201d in the EU\u2019s growth forecasts for Greece and \u201ca bit more specificity\u201d on how the eurozone will ease the country\u2019s debt burden in the long-run. The IMF does not want to write off Greece\u2019s debts, but is arguing for longer grace and repayment periods so they do not weigh so heavily on its economy. Earlier on Monday the French finance minister and his German counterpart pledged to work towards deeper integration of the single currency union. Bruno Le Maire and Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble flew to Brussels in the same plane, after a press conference in Berlin where they announced a working group on eurozone reform. Le Maire, appointed by Emmanuel Macron after the French president\u2019s election victory, said failure to deliver results on reforming the eurozone would bring political extremists of the left and right to power. Referring to Britain\u2019s looming exit from the EU, Le Maire stressed France and Germany intended to seize any opportunities for their financial industries. \u201cWe see in Brexit the possibility for our financial sectors to be more attractive than they were in the past. This means jobs, work, and wealth for our countries.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>Eurozone finance ministers have failed to agree a debt relief plan for Greece, raising the prospect of a summer crisis for the single currency bloc if Athens misses a loan repayment.</p> <p>A meeting of the eurozone\u2019s 19 finance ministers broke up late on Monday night, amid a row with the International Monetary Fund about Greece\u2019s debt burden.</p> <p>The standoff came just hours after France and Germany pledged to deepen co-operation in the single currency and seize Brexit opportunities for their banking industries.<br></p> <p>After more than eight hours of talks in Brussels, Greece\u2019s creditors \u2013 the eurozone members states and the IMF \u2013 were unable to bridge their differences on Greece\u2019s ability to repay its debts in the long run. </p> <p>\u201cWe were very close and we were just unable to manage it tonight,\u201d said Jeroen Dijsselbloem, the Dutch finance minister, who chaired the meeting. He said he hoped for a deal at the next eurozone meeting on 15 June.</p> <p>The eurozone-IMF standoff is the final obstacle to Greece unlocking a tranche of bailout funds that will let it repay \u20ac7.3bn (\u00a36.3bn) of loans due to be paid in July.</p> <p>The EU <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/jul/13/greece-bailout-agreement-key-points-grexit\">agreed an \u20ac86bn rescue package for Greece in July 2015</a>, an unprecedented third bailout that stopped the country from crashing out of the eurozone.</p> <p>Although the headline figure has been approved, Greece needs to carry out scores of detailed reforms before receiving the cash, which is paid in instalments. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/may/24/eurozone-officials-hope-to-give-greece-next-tranche-of-bailout\">It secured \u20ac10.3bn last May,</a> but the latest payment has been held up for months.</p> <p>It appeared the way was clear earlier in May when the Greek government agreed to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/may/02/greece-bailout-deal-austerity-strike-pensions-tax-breaks\">extra pension cuts and tax increases</a> demanded by creditors. However, a dispute between creditors has become a major stumbling block.</p> <p>Northern European countries do not want to sign off cheques for Greece unless the IMF agrees to be part of the third bailout. Countries such as Germany and the Netherlands think the IMF will add rigour to the programme and fear the EU institutions will be too soft on Athens.<br></p> <p>But the IMF has so far refused to get involved in Greece\u2019s third bailout because officials think the country\u2019s debts cannot be managed in the long-run. The Washington-based fund has repeatedly said it is looking for \u201ca credible strategy to restore debt sustainability\u201d.</p> <p>At the heart of the dispute is a demand that Greece run a budget surplus equivalent to 3.5% of GDP. The European side thinks Greece can hit this target, but the IMF has long argued that any country with high unemployment, (currently 23% in Greece) would struggle to meet such demanding fiscal targets<strong> </strong>over decades<strong>.</strong></p> <p>In a sign of a possible concession, Dijsselbloem said there had been \u201cfull agreement that the 3.5% primary surplus should remain for five years\u201d and eventually fall, although he did not specify a figure.<br></p> <p>The IMF continues to insist anything higher than a 1.5% surplus is not credible: its officials are urging the eurozone to be realistic about Greece\u2019s ability to keep a tight cap on public spending over decades.</p> <p>Speaking about Greece\u2019s debt sustainability, Dijsselbloem said there was a gap in expectations between the eurozone and the IMF. He said: \u201cWe need to close that [gap] by looking at additional options or adjusting our expectations. Both are possible and both should be done.\u201d </p> <p>Poul Thomsen, the head of the IMF\u2019s European department, said Greece had adopted \u201ca much more growth friendly-programme\u201d, but made clear the other creditors would have to give way on debt relief before the fund got on board. </p> <p>\u201cI am happy to say that we think we have a staff level-agreement on policy,\u201d he told journalists on Tuesday. \u201cThis needs to be supplemented with a credible package on debt relief. Here we are making progress, there is no doubt about that, but we are not quite there yet.\u201d </p> <p>He wants to see \u201cmore realism\u201d in the EU\u2019s growth forecasts for Greece and \u201ca bit more specificity\u201d on how the eurozone will ease the country\u2019s debt burden in the long-run.</p> <p>The IMF does not want to write off Greece\u2019s debts, but is arguing for longer grace and repayment periods so they do not weigh so heavily on its economy.</p> <p>Earlier on Monday the French finance minister and his German counterpart pledged to work towards deeper integration of the single currency union. Bruno Le Maire and Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble flew to Brussels in the same plane, after a press conference in Berlin where they announced a working group on eurozone reform.</p> <p>Le Maire, appointed by Emmanuel Macron after the French president\u2019s election victory, said failure to deliver results on reforming the eurozone would bring political extremists of the left and right to power. </p> <p>Referring to Britain\u2019s looming exit from the EU, Le Maire stressed France and Germany intended to seize any opportunities for their financial industries. \u201cWe see in Brexit the possibility for our financial sectors to be more attractive than they were in the past. This means jobs, work, and wealth for our countries.\u201d<br></p>",

      "bodyText": "Oil executives whose industry is promised further government support if the Conservatives are returned to power have given more than \u00a3390,000 to the party since Theresa May became prime minister. They include Ian Taylor, the chief executive of Vitol, whose firm was fined for making payments to an Iraqi state-owned firm, and Ayman Asfari, the chief executive of Petrofac, who was recently interviewed by the Serious Fraud Office over suspected corruption. Three of the donors have attended dinners with May or senior ministers since she took office. The payments will raise eyebrows because the 2017 manifesto includes a specific commitment to build upon previous \u201cunprecedented\u201d government support for the oil and gas industry. Labour, which compiled the figures, said they exposed a cosy relationship between the prime minister and the oil industry. A Conservative spokesman said: \u201cAll donations to the Conservative party are properly and transparently declared to the Electoral Commission, published by them, and comply fully with the law.\u201d Labour\u2019s Jon Trickett, the shadow Cabinet Office minister, said: \u201cIt\u2019s worrying to think that while Theresa May omitted to mention \u2018living standards\u2019 anywhere in the manifesto, she made a number of manifesto pledges to the oil and gas industry \u2013 including active support of new oil and gas facilities \u2013 after she and her cabinet ministers have been liaising with, and taking money from, the industry\u2019s top bosses.\u201d Since May became prime minister in July, the Tories have taken more than \u00a3390,000 in donations from six leading figures in Britain\u2019s oil and gas industry. Taylor, 60, has given \u00a347,000 to the Conservatives. Vitol is a major trader in North Sea oil and owns VPI Immingham on the river Humber which provides power for oil refineries. The firm was fined \u00a313m in 2007 after admitting payments to the Iraqi state oil company, and in 2012 was engaged in oil trade with Iran after EU sanctions had been put in place. A spokesperson for Vitol said Taylor\u2019s payments were not connected to the firm and claimed that the payments to Iraq\u2019s state oil firm were not illicit but were outside the scope of the UN. She added that Vitol had at no stage broken any oil trading sanctions. A former senior partner in Vitol, Matthew Ferrey, has given \u00a3124,000 to the Tories since July. He has since founded Rainworth Capital, which invests in the manufacturing of sensors for oil drilling. Amjad Bseisu is the Palestinian-born chief executive of oil and gas development and production company EnQuest, and previously worked for Petrofac. He has given \u00a328,500 to the Conservative party since December. Alexander Temerko is a Ukrainian-born businessman and former deputy chairman of the Russian Yukos Oil Company. He is now the director of oil engineering giant OGN Group, and has given \u00a363,800 since last July. Ayman Asfari is chief executive of Petrofac, a Jersey-registered international oil and gas provider, and gave \u00a390,000 to the Tories in December. In the first week of the election campaign, his wife, Sawsan, donated an additional \u00a350,000 to the party. Asfari has been questioned under caution by SFO officers investigating claims that Unaoil, a Monaco-based firm, corruptly secured contracts for multinationals. Unaoil and Petrofac have denied any wrongdoing. Abdul-Majid Jafar, the chief executive of Crescent Petroleum, gave the Tories \u00a328,000 in December. Three of the six donors \u2013 Taylor, Bseisu and Temerko \u2013 attended meetings of the Conservatives\u2019 Leader\u2019s Group donor club, which offers dinners and drinks events with the prime minister and senior members of the cabinet in exchange for a \u00a350,000 annual fee. According to the Conservatives\u2019 2017 manifesto, the Tories plan to aid the development of the decommissioning industry and the construction of the UK\u2019s first ultra-deep water port. It says: \u201cOther industries, like the oil and gas sector, are transforming. The North Sea has provided more than \u00a3300bn in tax revenue to the UK economy and supports thousands of highly skilled jobs across Britain. \u201cWe will ensure that the sector continues to play a critical role in our economy and domestic energy supply, supporting further investment in the UK\u2019s natural resources. We will continue to support the industry and build on the unprecedented support already provided to the oil and gas sector.\u201d",
