      "bodyText": "For steel and aluminium read wool. For trade rivalry between the US and China read the struggle between England and the Low Countries. For Donald Trump read Edward III. There is nothing new about the use of protectionism as a policy tool. England in the 14th century was in a similar position to a poor developing country today. It produced a lot of a staple commodity \u2013 wool \u2013 which it exported across the Channel to be turned into cloth by Flemish weavers. Edward wanted a slice of this lucrative business so he imposed controls on wool exports \u2013 thus depriving the Low Countries producers of the raw materials they needed \u2013 and imposed a complete ban on imports of cloth. For good measure, Edward was the first monarch to see the propaganda benefits of a Buy English campaign. He and his courtiers wore only English cloth and the king insisted that his lord chancellor sit on a cushion made of English wool. Hence the woolsack, still used today. This was merely the start of five centuries of protectionism that only ended in 1860 when \u2013 with Britain\u2019s manufacturers dominating the world \u2013 tariffs were finally scrapped. In the intervening period, Henry VII and Elizabeth I took further steps to nurture the fledgling textile sector, the Navigation Acts were passed to ensure that colonies could only trade with Britain, and tariffs on imported manufactures were kept high. In 1820, half a century or more after the start of the Industrial Revolution, the average levy on imported manufactures was 45-55%, more than double the 20% imposed by France. Protectionism worked for Britain. It put Flemish and Indian textile producers out of business and held back the growth of industry in the American colonies, which, as far as politicians in London were concerned, were there to provide the commodities that British factories would turn into finished goods. This approach was summed up by Pitt the Elder, who said in 1770 that the colonies should \u201cnot be permitted to manufacture so much as a horseshoe nail\u201d. Six years later, Adam Smith came to pretty much the same conclusion in The Wealth of Nations, in which he said America should concentrate on growing agricultural products and leave manufacturing to the mother country. Once free of British rule, the newly created United States took a rather different view. In 1791, the country\u2019s first Treasury secretary, Alexander Hamilton, produced a report for Congress that made the case for supporting America\u2019s \u201cinfant industries\u201d from foreign competition. Hamilton was not just the founder of US protectionism: he also proposed the first modern industrial strategy. Learning from Britain, he called for protective tariffs, bans on imports and curbs on exports of strategically important raw materials. But he also wanted patent protection for inventions, product regulation and investment in infrastructure. In the last decade of the 18th century, the US was not ready for this radical blueprint. Tariffs were introduced but at too low a level to allow nascent American firms to compete internationally. But over the next 100 years, protectionism was ratcheted up. In the second half of the 19th century, when America was industrialising rapidly, tariffs on manufactured imports stood at 40-50%, higher than anywhere else in the world. The next phase of American protectionism came in 1930 when the Smoot-Hawley tariff triggered a domino effect across the developed world. When other countries found themselves frozen out of the US market by a 48% average industrial tariff, they responded in kind. The tit-for-tat protectionism did not cause the Great Depression, but it certainly deepened and lengthened it. By the end of the second world war the US had achieved, like Britain a century before, global economic dominance. This necessitated a change of strategy in favour of liberalising global markets so that US producers could take advantage of being more efficient than those of rival countries. But Washington\u2019s support for free trade was contingent on the US remaining global top dog. It started to wane when its industrial supremacy was threatened by Japan in the 1980s. The even bigger threat posed by China has seen the country return to its protectionist roots.",

      "bodyText": "False emissions ratings for cars based on lab tests have cost the UK more than \u00a32bn a year in lost tax revenue, according to the Green party. With CO2 emissions exceeding official measures by an average of 42%, millions of vehicles have been placed in tax bands that do not reflect their true levels of pollution, according to new research published on Saturday. Since 2001, UK vehicle excise duty has been based on carbon emissions. Cars registered before April 2017 and producing less than 100g of CO2 per km are exempt, with the rate rising to \u00a3535 for the most polluting cars. Analysis for the Green party in Europe shows that car taxes would have been more than \u20ac10bn higher across 11 EU countries last year, with the UK one of the main losers due to its large car fleet and graded tax system. The report estimated a loss of more than \u00a32bn in the UK in 2016, based only on new vehicles registered since 2010, which make up around half of the cars now on the road. One of the authors, Matthias Runkel of Green Budget Germany, said evidence showed a greater divergence in lab results and actual emissions after 2010, but including older vehicles the true loss to the exchequer was likely to be far higher. Molly Scott Cato, Green spokeswoman on tax justice in the European parliament, said: \u201cTaxation based on the polluter pays principle has the potential to gear up the transition to a low carbon economy. \u201cInstead, the shocking loss in potential tax revenue from cars has been matched by an air pollution health crisis in our cities and increasing CO2 emissions driving climate breakdown.\u201d Further calls for road tax to better reflect pollution have come this week after independent testing revealed some new diesel models, certified as Euro 6 compliant, emit more than 12 times the legal limit of NOx in real-world conditions. Fiat 500X, Nissan Juke and Renault Megane models were all graded among the worst polluters in tests conducted by Emissions Analytics. However, testers found that other diesels \u2013 including BMW 5 Series, Mercedes E Class, Audi Q2, Seat Alhambra and VW Golf models \u2013 beat some new petrol cars. They emitted less than 80mg/km of NOx pollution in real-world tests, lending partial support to manufacturers\u2019 claims that the newest diesel cars are the cleanest ever. Industry body SMMT has warned that more pollution could be a consequence if consumers hold back from buying new cars. Tax changes, following concern over public health and air quality, in the wake of the VW scandal, have seen diesel sales plummet. All new diesels will be placed in a higher tax band from April, before a real-world driving emissions certification comes into force in 2020. Nick Molden, the chief executive of Emissions Analytics, said: \u201cThe most efficient diesel engines continue to improve while some of the worst remain on the market, meaning the confusion for consumers increases rather than diminishes. \u201cThe danger is that motorists who bought genuinely clean diesels \u2013 together with the manufacturers who made them \u2013 suffer the consequences of the general confusion and loss of confidence.\u201d He added that both CO2 and particulate pollution could rise as a result.",

    "webTitle": "Australia spared US steel and aluminium tariffs, Turnbull confirms", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, has confirmed that Australia has won a reprieve from the United States\u2019 global steel and aluminium tariffs, after the US president, Donald Trump, earlier tweeted that he and Turnbull were working on a \u201csecurity agreement\u201d for an exemption. In a post on Twitter, Trump had said he was negotiating directly with the Australian prime minister. \u201cSpoke to PM of Australia. He is committed to having a very fair and reciprocal military and trade relationship. Working very quickly on a security agreement so we don\u2019t have to impose steel or aluminum (sic) tariffs on our ally, the great nation of Australia!,\u201d Trump wrote. Turnbull then replied, also on Twitter, and using the US president\u2019s trademark exclamatory punctuation: \u201cGreat discussion today on security and trade. Australia/US trade is fair &amp; reciprocal &amp; each of our nations has no closer ally. Thank you for confirming new tariffs won\u2019t have to be imposed on Australian steel &amp; aluminium - good for jobs in Australia and in US!\u201d The tarrifs \u2013 25% on foreign steel and 10% on foreign aluminium \u2013 are set to come into force in a fortnight. Turnbull said an executive order would be signed by Trump exempting Australia from the tariffs. He said legal paperwork confirming the exemption was yet to be completed, but an executive order would put Trump\u2019s direction in place. Australia would not have to provide anything in return for the exemption, he added. Turnbull denied the two countries were working on a new \u201csecurity\u201d agreement, saying Trump\u2019s statement was referring to the legal paperwork and proclamation that will now follow to put the exemption in place. \u201cWe have the closest possible military and security alliance with the United States and it gets closer all of the time,\u201d he said. Australia is one of the US\u2019s closest military and security allies, and a member of the Five Eyes intelligence alliance. Trade tariffs were a campaign pledge from Trump, but Australia, as a close ally of the US, had been confident its imports would not attract the charges. Trump announced the tariffs \u2013 which he argues are designed to \u201cdefend the American worker\u201d but which are widely seen as targeting China \u2013 at a news conference on Thursday. The Australian government, which believed it had previously been promised an exemption, has been working furiously behind the scenes to win similar exemptions to those granted to Mexico and Canada. The tweet is the second time Trump has singled out Australia for a possible exemption. But Australian Industry Group chief executive Innes Willox said the tariff announcement would still hurt companies even if an exemption was granted. \u201cWhile we hope that Australia will win exemptions from the latest steel and aluminium tariffs, this would be only a partial victory,\u201d Willox said on Friday. He said any special treatment afforded to Australia would only apply to shipments coming out of the country, and not to those from Australian companies in third markets. \u201cAs a country with a high reliance on trade, the risks of broader damage to the global economy from a trade war are great,\u201d Willox said. The former prime minister Kevin Rudd said on Saturday that even if Australia secured an exemption, a global tit-for-tat was a concern, and he disagreed with Trump\u2019s belief that trade wars were good. \u201cHistory tells us they are bad, and they end up causing not just a contraction in the global trade but, as a result of that, a contraction in global growth,\u201d he told the ABC.",
