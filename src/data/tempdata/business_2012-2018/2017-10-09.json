A lot is riding on the court\u2019s decision \u2013 for both sides. In the case of Moya Greene, the chief executive of Royal Mail, her credibility is on the line. She negotiated an \u201cagenda for growth\u201d agreement with the union just before privatisation in 2013 and it is a clause in that document that the company is now trying to enforce. In essence, Royal Mail committed not to move jobs offshore, not to outsource roles and to limit the use zero-hours contracts. In return, it argues, the CWU agreed that five weeks of arbitration must take place before a strike can go ahead. Given how much weight Royal Mail attached to the agreement \u2013 at privatisation and subsequently \u2013 Greene needs to be able to show the wording was legally watertight. The CWU\u2019s stance is that mediation has already happened and that Royal Mail is deliberately misinterpreting the 2013 agreement. There was a mediator present during the 18 months of talks that failed to reach a deal on pay and pensions, it argues. Union leaders, too, will look foolish if their legal arguments fail and next week\u2019s strike has to be abandoned. The CWU signed the \u201cagenda for growth\u201d document; it is not a general piece of trades union legislation. A battle in the high court probably won\u2019t calm the mood on either side, whatever is decided, but the loser will start on the back foot. IoD governance report could spur wrong kind of debate Is GlaxoSmithKline the worst-governed company in the FTSE 100 index? Can Barclays really be the fourth best? The Institute of Directors thinks so \u2013 or, rather, its Good Governance Report has produced these rankings for 2017 based on 47 \u201cindicators\u201d of good governance weighted according to significance. It all sounds terribly objective and mathematical until you examine the breakdown of the scores and realise nobody applied a filter for common sense. Why is Glaxo ranked a long way below Rolls-Royce and BT for \u201caudit risk and external accountability\u201d? The engine-maker in January agreed to pay \u00a3671m in penalties to settle allegations of bribery and corruption brought by the Serious Fraud Office. In the same month, BT confessed to a \u00a3530m black hole in its subsidiary in Italy. Glaxo\u2019s big Chinese bribery scandal was three years ago and it has suffered no similar indignity since. How can the pharmaceuticals firm still be bottom of the pile? Other weird findings include a near-perfect score for Imperial Brands on \u201cshareholder relations\u201d even though shareholders in the tobacco group revolted over a plan to give the chief executive a big pay rise. Meanwhile, Provident Financial has illustrated how these reports can be a hostage to events. The doorstep lender received its near-perfect score for \u201cremuneration and reward\u201d just before its share price collapsed and the chief executive, Peter Crook, who had been paid \u00a330m over five years, was ousted. As for Barclays, fourth place is clearly better than the last place it received a couple of years ago. Yet the high ranking ignores the fact that its chief executive, Jes Staley, is under investigation by the financial regulator for the serious governance breach of attempting to unmask a whistleblower. Perhaps one shouldn\u2019t be too hard on the IoD, which promotes good governance more actively than the CBI and has been strong in denouncing lax standards at Sports Direct and BHS. But this report may fail in its attempt \u201cto stimulate an ongoing debate about the importance of good corporate governance\u201d.

The strategy could be influenced by financial market regulations that are changing anyway. But Brexit seems the most likely spur. Amid the non-agreement over transitional arrangements, Frankfurt sees an opportunity to grab a slice of a lucrative market from the London Stock Exchange, which currently dominates the clearing game.

The Office for National Statistics said on Monday it made a mistake in its original calculations for the growth in unit labour costs, which is the price paid by employers to produce a given amount of economic output. The measure stood at an annual 2.4% in the three months to June, as opposed to the 1.6% initially published by the country\u2019s official statistics body on Friday. The revision could indicate momentum for wages in the UK, which is a factor under close observation from Threadneedle Street, as it looks to raise interest rates for the first time in more than a decade. Rising labour costs could indicate economic strength and justify a rate hike. Howard Archer, the chief economic adviser to the EY Item Club, said the change \u201cmay facilitate\u201d a November rate hike by the Bank. The cost of borrowing could increase from 0.25% to 0.5% should the monetary policy committee decide the economy is able to withstand the increase. Despite the positive signal for the economy, there have been numerous readings to paint a much weaker picture. The construction sector is reporting signs of a slump, while the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development \u2013 a thinktank for developed economies \u2013 has warned that UK growth will slow next year. Analysts at the Swiss bank UBS said on Monday a rate hike could also \u201cexacerbate\u201d potential headwinds for the UK economy generated by the Brexit process. \u201cWe think there is a strong case for erring on the side of caution,\u201d they wrote. Despite the lowest levels of unemployment since the mid-1970s, wages for British workers have failed to rise above the rate of inflation. Pay growth is rising nonetheless, although it lags behind a spike in the cost of living from the increasing cost of imports linked to the weak pound. While the increase in unit labour costs potentially indicate an increase in wages for British workers, the increase could have been driven by non-wage elements such as taxes and pensions contributions paid by employers. This would weaken the ground for increasing rates, according to economists at Barclays. However Mark Carney, the Bank of England governor, has previously said that rising labour costs could pave the way for a rate rise. Speaking over the summer, he justified the reluctance of the monetary policy committee to increase rates due to \u201csubdued\u201d wages and labour costs.

    "webTitle": "Ministers plan reforms to prevent repeat of Monarch collapse", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Reforms to let financially stricken airlines keep flying, and protect passengers from being stranded by a sudden collapse, will be sought by the government following the demise of Monarch. The transport secretary, Chris Grayling, told the Commons on Monday he would focus his efforts on finding ways for airlines to \u201cwind down in an orderly manner and look after customers\u201d rather than be simply grounded in the event of insolvency. The pledge came as the Labour party and unions demanded a full investigation into Monarch\u2019s failure, including the costs to the taxpayer of repatriating 110,000 Monarch passengers from foreign destinations. Grayling said: \u201cAll parties considered options to avoid the collapse of the company. Ultimately, however, Monarch\u2019s board took the decision to place it into administration.\u201d He said that once Monarch passengers had been returned to the UK, \u201cour efforts will turn to working through the reforms necessary to ensure passengers do not find themselves in this position again\u201d. Britain\u2019s longest-surviving airline brand was placed into administration early last Monday morning, leaving 110,000 customers abroad and 750,000 future bookings cancelled. The government took the responsibility of flying passengers home, most of whom had no protection under the Atol scheme, which covers people who book with holiday companies, or travel insurance. Grayling said: \u201cWe need to look at all the options, not just Atol, but also whether it is possible for airlines to be able to wind down in an orderly manner and look after their customers themselves without the need for government to step in. This is where we will focus our efforts in the weeks and months ahead.\u201d More than 1,800 employees were made redundant, and several hundred more head office staff are set to lose their jobs. Labour said Monarch collapsed \u201cbecause of a litany of failure by government and regulators\u201d. The shadow transport secretary, Andy McDonald, said the bankruptcy had \u201cleft huge losses on the shoulders of the public ... staff, pensioners, customers and taxpayers rather than shareholders who will pay the price.\u201d McDonald said the sudden collapse meant assets such as landing slots risked not being realised. \u201cInstead assets will go to the secured creditor, Greybull Capital, while the public purse gets nothing.\u201d He said that the role of accountants KPMG, which was called in to find buyers but was now the administrator, was \u201ca glaring conflict of interest\u201d and passengers would want to know why the Civil Aviation Authority did not stop Monarch selling flights in the days before it went bust. Grayling said Labour should praise the government for arranging the return of passengers abroad, an operation that is expected to cost the taxpayer \u00a360m. He said constructive conversations were taking place with credit card companies to recoup costs: \u201cWe will be very focused on a clear burden-sharing exercise taking place.\u201d Grayling said the government would give thought to reforming an insolvency framework that left Monarch planes on the ground, while airlines from other European countries continued to operate after filing for administration. Citing examples of recent airline failures on the continent, he said: \u201cWe need to look at what happened with Air Berlin and Alitalia.\u201d The transport secretary said he would press the case for change with the insurance industryas many passengers\u2019 policies did not cover airline collapse. He said: \u201cI feel deepest for those who\u2019ve made bookings and lost holidays ... I know it\u2019s a deeply traumatic time.\u201d There were angry exchanges over whether Brexit had played a role in Monarch\u2019s demise \u2013 with sterling\u2019s decline cited by the administrators and airline executives. McDonald said a \u201cfurther backdrop is the foggy skies of Brexit and a total lack of certainty\u201d in aviation. The SNP\u2019s consumer affairs spokesperson, Patricia Gibson, said Monarch was a \u201cstark example of the realities of Brexit beginning to bite\u201d, with a drop in the pound affecting bookings and deterring investors.

Ultimately, however, Monarch\u2019s board took the decision to place it into administration.\u201d</p> <p>He said that once Monarch passengers had been returned to the UK, \u201cour efforts will turn to working through the reforms necessary to ensure passengers do not find themselves in this position again\u201d.</p> <p>Britain\u2019s longest-surviving airline brand was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/oct/02/monarch-airlines-flights-cancelled-as-airline-goes-into-administration\">placed into administration early last Monday morning</a>, leaving 110,000 customers abroad and 750,000 future bookings cancelled. The government took the responsibility of flying passengers home, most of whom had no protection under the Atol scheme, which covers people who book with holiday companies, or travel insurance. <br></p> <p>Grayling said: \u201cWe need to look at all the options, not just Atol, but also whether it is possible for airlines to be able to wind down in an orderly manner and look after their customers themselves without the need for government to step in. This is where we will focus our efforts in the weeks and months ahead.\u201d<br></p> <p>More than 1,800 employees were made redundant, and several hundred more head office staff are set to lose their jobs.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Labour said Monarch collapsed \u201cbecause of a litany of failure by government and regulators\u201d. The shadow transport secretary, Andy McDonald, said the bankruptcy had \u201cleft huge losses on the shoulders of the public ... staff, pensioners, customers and taxpayers rather than shareholders who will pay the price.\u201d</p> <p>McDonald said the sudden collapse meant assets such as landing slots risked not being realised. \u201cInstead assets will go to the secured creditor, Greybull Capital, while the public purse gets nothing.\u201d</p> <p>He said that the role of accountants KPMG, which was called in to find buyers but was now the administrator, was \u201ca glaring conflict of interest\u201d and passengers would want to know why the Civil Aviation Authority did not stop Monarch selling flights in the days before it went bust. </p> <p>Grayling said Labour should praise the government for arranging the return of passengers abroad, an operation that is expected to cost the taxpayer \u00a360m. He said constructive conversations were taking place with credit card companies to recoup costs: \u201cWe will be very focused on a clear burden-sharing exercise taking place.\u201d</p> <p>Grayling said the government would give thought to reforming an insolvency framework that left Monarch planes on the ground, while airlines from other European countries continued to operate after filing for administration. Citing examples of recent airline failures on the continent, he said: \u201cWe need to look at what happened with Air Berlin and Alitalia.\u201d</p> <p>The transport secretary said he would press the case for change with the insurance industryas many passengers\u2019 policies did not cover airline collapse. He said: \u201cI feel deepest for those who\u2019ve made bookings and lost holidays ... I know it\u2019s a deeply traumatic time.\u201d </p> <p>There were angry exchanges over whether Brexit had played a role in Monarch\u2019s demise \u2013 with sterling\u2019s decline cited by the administrators and airline executives. McDonald said a \u201cfurther backdrop is the foggy skies of Brexit and a total lack of certainty\u201d in aviation. The SNP\u2019s consumer affairs spokesperson, Patricia Gibson, said Monarch was a \u201cstark example of the realities of Brexit beginning to bite\u201d, with a drop in the pound affecting bookings and deterring investors.</p> <p>Grayling said: \u201cLet me be clear: this airline did not fail because of Brexit.\u201d He said aviation remained strong and referred to huge investment in the UK by Norwegian \u2013 another airline that industry figures have suggested may struggle financially.</p> <p>Balpa, the union representing about 400 pilots who lost their jobs at Monarch, called on the transport select committee to investigate the circumstances of the collapse.

Many of the cuts will affect BAE\u2019s Warton factory in Preston, Lancashire, but there will also be job losses at other locations, Sky News reported. BAE is expected to make an announcement later by Tuesday, when it is due to release an update on trading. The company, which makes the Eurofighter Typhoon aircraft and Britain\u2019s nuclear submarines, employs 34,600 people in the UK, out of 83,100 worldwide. The defence firm did not confirm the job cuts but said in a statement: \u201cBAE Systems continually reviews its operations to make sure we are performing as effectively and efficiently as possible, delivering our commitments to existing customers and ensuring we are best placed to secure future business. If and when there are any changes proposed we are committed to communicating with our employees and their representatives first.\u201d Britain\u2019s largest union, Unite, called on the UK government to end the uncertainty for thousands of BAE workers by committing to build the next-generation fighter jet in the UK. Unite is demanding and urgent meeting with BAE and that it \u201ccomes clean over its plans\u201d. The union estimates that by 2020, a quarter of the UK\u2019s defence spend will be benefiting American companies such as Boeing and Lockheed Martin. The Unite assistant general secretary. Steve Turner, said: \u201cIf these job cuts materialise it will significantly undermine our nation\u2019s sovereign defence capability and leave us reliant on foreign powers and foreign companies for the successor to the Typhoon and the defence of the nation. \u201cMinisters should be under no illusion. Once these jobs are gone, they are gone for a generation and with them the skills and ability to control our own defence and manufacture the next generation of fighter jets and other defence equipment in the UK ... At a time of Brexit, these are precisely the kind of jobs that the UK government should be protecting.\u201d BAE\u2019s decision does not appear to be related to the Brexit vote, although it is likely to feature in discussions between the prime minister, Theresa May, and UK business leaders on Monday. The job cuts are reportedly linked to a slowdown in production of the Typhoon, amid uncertainty about the timing of a large order from Saudi Arabia. It is the first major move by the BAE chief executive, Charles Woodburn, who took over from Ian King on 1 July. According to Sky, Woodburn said in August: \u201cWe obviously have to review our [Typhoon] production demand very carefully. We are confident that we will win further Typhoon orders, what we can\u2019t be confident around is the timing.\u201d In August BAE reported an 11% rise in half-year underlying profits to \u00a3945m and said it was on track to meet its full-year target. It is the third-biggest defence manufacturer in the world, with key markets in the US, Australia and Saudi Arabia.",

Watson said the admission on Friday from Murdoch\u2019s News Group Newspapers, the publisher of the Sun and the now-closed News of the World, was \u201chighly significant and relevant\u201d and he wants a written assurance that the CMS will include it in the findings of its investigation. In a letter to Andrea Coscelli, the chief executive of the CMA, Watson said: \u201cWith this admission of guilt we can now add computer hacking to the ever growing list of criminal activity engaged in by the Murdoch media empire. These crimes may be historic, but as the Murdochs attempt to expand their reach and power through Fox\u2019s bid for the remaining stake in Sky that they do not already own, they are highly significant and relevant. \u201cThey are not only examples of criminal behaviour, but of corporate governance failure, and demonstrate the lengths members of the Murdoch family, who occupied senior executive positions at the company, were prepared to go to in order to avoid the truth coming to light.\u201d In a hearing at the high court on Friday, News Group admitted that a private investigations firm had hacked the computer of a former army intelligence officer, Ian Hurst, in 2006 and that its boss, Jonathan Rees, had then sent intercepted information to the newspaper publisher.

      "bodyText": "The distribution of the GST is among the hottest of political potatoes, and so it was little wonder that after Monday\u2019s release of the Productivity Commission\u2019s draft report on horizontal fiscal equalisation, the treasurer, Scott Morrison, steered well clear of any specific recommendations and kept to talk of a \u201cfair go\u201d. While Morrison did speak of a general need to fix the system, he did nothing to indicate his preference for any of the specific recommendations in the report. This is no surprise given the zero-sum game of goods and services tax distribution, the commission\u2019s recommendations would result in Morrison having to convince every government except Western Australia to be losers. Perhaps the most accurate statement in the Productivity Commission draft report on horizontal fiscal equalisation (HFE) is when it notes that \u201cthere is a dearth of public understanding of how HFE works, and this is compounded by the lack of a strong neutral voice in public discussion\u201d. HFE is essentially about attempting to provide each state and territory government with the same capacity to provide services and infrastructure. That sounds straight forward, but because HFE mostly occurs through distributing GST revenue across the states, if you suggest one state should get more GST revenue to ensure it is fiscally equal, that means other states must get less. It\u2019s very tough to find a \u201cstrong neutral voice\u201d in a zero-sum game. Because different states have both different spending needs and differing abilities to raise revenue, all states get either more or less than they would were we to assume that everything was equal and the GST should be carved up on a per capita basis. In 2017-18 New South Wales, Victoria and Western Australia received less GST revenue than their share Australia\u2019s population would warrant. If the GST was carved up purely along population lines, WA this year would have received $4.4bn more: The reasons for the difference is due to both revenue and expenditure. The massive amount of revenue that WA is able to raise via mining royalties reduces its share of GST by $5.5bn, whereas the housing boom that brings with it stamp duty means NSW receives $1.8bn less than it otherwise would \u2013 because those states in effect have an unequal ability to raise revenue: But each state also has different issues that affect its spending requirements \u2013 such as the age of the population and the share of Indigenous people. Some states also have higher public sector wage costs (which might be due to remoteness and the distance required to service \u2013 as is the case with WA): Easily the biggest impact on GST is mining revenue, and this is the main driver behind the decision to review HFE. From the Western Australian point of view, the current system is unfair because its massive mining royalties means it receives less GST per capita by far than any other state. Its current relativity per capita share is 60% lower than the NSW, which has the next lowest share: But we need some context. Until the arrival of the boom in mining royalties, WA was the biggest winner from HFE. Starting from federation, WA until around 2010 had been a much greater beneficiary of commonwealth money than any other state. NSW and Victoria, as the biggest states, are easily the ones who have \u201clost\u201d the most money to other states in the interests of HFE: And while WA is not doing all that well out of the GST carve-up now, the Productivity Commission notes that because the GST distribution is worked out using a three-year average of revenue such as mining royalties, the state actually received more GST than it would have had its share been worked out using the actual mining royalties. The report notes that the Commonwealth Grants Commission (CGC) has estimated that the growth in iron ore royalties saw WA retain an extra $7bn in GST over the six years to 2015-16: And no one should pretend they did not see the fall coming. The Western Australian government in its 2011-12 budget even noted that it estimated in 2014-15 it would receive only a 33% share of its GST (an amount that was actually slightly conservative). However rather than budget for this fall, in perhaps one of the most disgraceful public finance decisions in Australian government history, the then WA treasurer Christian Porter instead assumed that the GST rules would be changed. In his budget speech, he told the WA parliament that \u201cwhat we reasonably anticipate is that in 2013-14 the CGC will have brought in a new GST system. We expect it will produce a floor of about 75% of our population share of the GST. Therefore we expect extra revenue of $1.8bn in 2013-14 and $2.5bn in 2014-15.\u201d He might as well have assumed that fairies at the bottom of the garden were about to invent a money tree. We should note that the author of this manifestly wrong assumption is now the federal minister for social services. Never let it be said that gross budgetary incompetence is any hindrance to promotion in government. But the Productivity Commission does note that there are problems with the current system. At the moment, the system works to get each state equal to the best performing state. The commission notes that this has worked well in the past, but is less effective now because Western Australia\u2019s revenue capacity is abnormally large and somewhat erratic. It means that \u201cthe redistribution task is considerable and the standard being equalised to is potentially volatile.\u201d The commission therefore recommends that \u201cequalisation should no longer be to the highest state, but instead the average or the second highest state\u201d. Such a move would be \u2013 to put it mildly \u2013 political difficult. Every state would be worse off except Western Australia: Good luck getting Queensland and South Australian governments \u2013 who are both worried about losing seats at the upcoming state elections to One Nation or the Nick Xenophon party \u2013 to agree to a system that would cost them, in Queensland\u2019s case, to $1.5bn. The commission also used the report to bang its drum for economic reforms it has long favoured \u2013 including a congestion tax and a shift from stamp duty to a land tax. It argues that the current system is a disincentive for tax reform because were a state to introduce a new tax it would likely lose GST revenue. Although, rather crucially, it notes that \u201cthere is no direct evidence that such incentives have changed specific policy decisions\u201d. It excuses this lack of evidence with the rather philosophical view that \u201can absence of evidence is not evidence of absence\u201d. However it rather strains credibility to suggest the reason states have not pursued a congestion tax is a worry over a decline in their share of GST rather than the actual worry over the massive political unpopularity of the policy. But there is no need to question the difficulty of the proposed changes for distributing GST. Six years ago, Porter thought it reasonable to assume that a change to the GST distribution would have occurred four years ago \u2013 such a change never came close to occurring. On the back of this draft report however we are at least closer to knowing what a change to the system would look like, but we are no closer to altering the political challenges such a change would face.",

      "bodyText": "Royal Mail is seeking a high court injunction to stop a planned 48-hour strike by postal workers after the Communication Workers Union did not meet a midday deadline to withdraw industrial action. Members of the CWU voted overwhelmingly in favour of strikes last week and are to take action from 19 October. Staff could also stage walkouts during the Black Friday retail sales event next month or during the festive season. If the strike over pensions, pay and jobs goes ahead, it would be the first national walkout since Royal Mail was privatised four years ago. Royal Mail said the CWU had missed a Monday deadline to remove the threat and agree to peace talks. The company claims that, under an agreement with the union, the CWU must enter mediation with Royal Mail before embarking on industrial action. The CWU, in turn, claims that it has been attempting to find a solution to the dispute for 18 months. The company has written to the CWU, invoking a \u201clegally binding external mediation process\u201d, and reiterated that any industrial action would be unlawful. Royal Mail said: \u201cThe company requested that CWU withdraw its notification of industrial action by 12 noon today and commit to following the dispute resolution procedures. \u201cCWU has declined to withdraw its notification. As a result, Royal Mail will today lodge an application with the high court for an injunction to prevent industrial action so that the contractual external mediation process can be followed.\u201d A week ago, 89% of the CWU\u2019s 111,000 workers backed a walkout, with 74% of members turning out to vote. The vote was a major test for the union after the introduction of the Trade Union Act, which requires strike ballots to have a 50% turnout. The ballot came amid a flurry of union activity this autumn as public sector and health workers discuss the possibilities of industrial action. Dave Ward, the CWU general secretary, said: \u201cThe fact Royal Mail Group have tried multiple angles to stop our members exercising their democratic right to take strike action shows how desperate they are. Instead of playing courtroom politics they should be listening to the overwhelming ballot result. We call on the public and businesses across the country to back their postal workers in what was always going to be a watershed dispute.\u201d A spokesperson for Royal Mail said the company had contingency plans in place should the strike go ahead and would \u201cdo everything we can to minimise any disruption to our customers\u201d. He said the company was committed to further talks to reach agreement with the CWU. \u201cThere are no grounds for industrial action. We want to reach agreement.\u201d The company insisted that it was \u201cmaking a very good offer on pay\u201d \u2013 continuing to provide the \u201cbest pay and terms and conditions in the industry\u201d alongside a proposal for a pension scheme that \u201ccompares favourably to other large employers\u201d. The spokesperson said: \u201cWe are not proposing to change our core terms and conditions or our commitment to a predominantly permanent workforce. Many competitors pay around the national living wage. Royal Mail pays 45%-50% more than this.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Debit cards are being used less often abroad because the fall in the pound after the EU referendum has encouraged more Britons to holiday in the UK, the banking industry has claimed. UK Finance, the financial sector trade body, said staycations helped explain why activity on debit cards overseas was 13% lower this August than a year ago. Since the UK voted to leave the EU in June 2016 the pound has fallen 11% against the dollar and 14% against the euro, making it more expensive for UK-based holidaymakers to take foreign holidays. In its latest debit card report, UK Finance said: \u201cActivity in August was 13% lower than a year ago in both value and volume terms. This decrease, in part, highlights the growing consumer preference to holiday in the UK as sterling\u2019s purchasing power abroad has weakened considerably since the Brexit vote.\u201d Official data for July 2017 showed a fall in the number of people travelling to Europe and beyond, with a 2% slide to 6.9 million, while spending by UK residents on foreign holidays also declined by 2% to \u00a34.5bn on the same month a year earlier. UK Finance\u2019s data for August 2017 showed a rise in the total use of debit cards when compared with the previous month as the school holidays got into full swing. The number of purchases rose 0.4%, while spending was 0.8% higher at \u00a33.2bn. Overall, the number of debit card payments has risen 12% since August a year ago, as domestic use increased, while the value of payments also rose, by 4.7%. UK Finance, created when a number of industry lobby groups merged this year, said higher inflation and the uncertain economic backdrop since Brexit had also influenced the use of debit cards. When measured against the previous month, the value of debit card payments rose by 0.8% \u2013 its strongest growth for level for 11 months, which UK Finance said was in part the result of the higher inflation rate. However, UK Finance said the month-on-month increase in the use of cards was 1.1% \u2013 lower than the monthly growth rate of a year earlier because of the \u201ccontinued economic uncertainty in the UK, a relatively low rate of economic growth and weak consumer confidence\u201d. The growing use of contactless cards is among the reasons for the fall in the average transaction value on debit cards used in the UK to \u00a338.37, down from \u00a341.82 a year ago and \u00a348.70 seven years ago when it peaked.",

      "bodyText": "London\u2019s dominance of the \u20ac1tn-a-day (\u00a3890bn) euro clearing market is facing a new threat after the Frankfurt stock exchange announced a plan designed to lure the lucrative business from the City as a result of the Brexit vote. Clearing is at the heart of the financial system and has become a key issue since the referendum as the majority of transactions denominated in euros are handled through London. The activity is closely watched by financial regulators around the globe because it is intended to reduce risk in the financial system. Clearing houses act as intermediaries between the complex derivatives transactions which, for example, help protect companies against interest rate moves. Deutsche B\u00f6rse is now setting up a scheme that would allow the big investment banks that channel trades through its clearing operations to share in the profits \u2013 a move regarded as a direct challenge to London. Deutsche B\u00f6rse described its move an an attempt to \u201cto further accelerate the development of a liquid, EU based alternative for the clearing of interest rate swaps\u201d. The finance minister for the German state of Hesse, Thomas Sch\u00e4fer, said the plan would be beneficial for Frankfurt, which is one of the key cities among the remaining 27 EU nations vying for business that the City could lose as a result of Brexit. For eurozone members, London\u2019s dominance in euro-clearing is a long-running issue. In 2015, the UK government won a legal case against the European Central Bank, which had demanded that clearing houses should be based in the eurozone if they handed euro-dominated trades. In preparation for Brexit, Brussels has proposed ideas that could give the EU more responsibility for regulating foreign clearing houses. Sch\u00e4fer said Deutsche B\u00f6rse\u2019s clearing operation \u2013 known as Eurex \u2013 was \u201cvery clearly throwing its hat in the ring\u201d as a contender for new business. \u201cFrankfurt as a financial centre will profit from this because clearing will become more attractive for German and international players,\u201d Sch\u00e4fer said. But there have been warnings that risks to the financial system could increase if euro-clearing business migrates and fragments around other financial centres. Jobs are also at risk, according to Xavier Rolet, the chief executive of the London Stock Exchange which owns 57% of the LCH. In the run-up to the EU referendum, Rolet said up to 100,000 jobs across the UK could be lost if London was stripped of its responsibility for clearing financial products denominated in euros. Investment banks already share in the profits generated from their activities on the LCH as they own stakes in the business. Deutsche B\u00f6rse said US investment banks Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Citigroup, JP Morgan and Morgan Stanley have already registered their early interest to participate in the new scheme along with German banks Commerzbank and Deutsche Bank. In March, Margrethe Vestager, the EU competition regulator, blocked the \u00a321bn merger between the LSE and Deutsche B\u00f6rse. Frankfurt is already attracting more Brexit-related job moves than other potential EU centre, according to data compiled by the City of London Corporation, the local authority which covers much of London\u2019s financial district. It calculates that 9,750 roles have already been linked to the German city while last week Goldman Sachs admitted it had begun to make plans for Brexit by leasing space in a new Frankfurt tower block that could hold up to 1,000 staff.",

      "bodyText": "So we\u2019ve had the Nobel prizes for this year, with the economics award the last on the agenda. It\u2019s gone to US economist Richard Thaler for his work on behavioural economics. He plans to spend the prize money \u201cirrationally\u201d, he told the awards committee. Here is our news story on the award: And here is an explanation of his speciality, behavioural economics: On that note, we\u2019re closing for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. Thaler will be giving a news conference in Chicago later, and here are the details: Here\u2019s Michael Lewis, author of the book The Big Short which was subsequently made into the film in which Richard Thaler appeared, on the new Nobel prize winner, from 2015. And here is Thaler and Selena Gomez in that very film: Guardian Business has launched a daily email. Besides the key news headlines that you\u2019d expect, there\u2019s an at-a-glance agenda of the day\u2019s main events, insightful opinion pieces and a quality feature to sink your teeth into each day. For your morning shot of financial news, sign up here: Just over a year ago Thaler and fellow Nobel prize winning economist Eugene Fama took part in an interesting debate about whether markets were efficient or irrational. He also commented on Theresa May\u2019s speech - not the parts that received the most commentary - but on her organ donor plans, in response to another tweet: Thaler has criticised the Brexit vote as a prime example of irrational behaviour. He told Business Insider just ahead of the UK referendum vote: Most voters aren\u2019t really thinking about it in a very analytical way\u2026 The people behind the leave campaign are voting with their guts. There\u2019s no spreadsheet. This is much like a divorce without a prenup. You\u2019re voting to leave, and we\u2019ll take care of all the financial details later. Thaler was apparently slow to wake up when the committee called him with the news of his award, but was unsurprisingly pleased with the news. His biography on the University of Chicago website lists one of his interests as \u201cfine wine\u201d which will no doubt be part of a celebration later. His personal website is here but so far, no mention of the Nobel prize. Here is one of the committee members talking about Thaler, and explaining what behavioural economics is: Here\u2019s our story on Thaler\u2019s award: The 2017 Nobel prize in economics has been awarded to the US academic Richard Thaler of the University of Chicago for his contribution to behavioural economics. The prize, worth 9m Swedish kroner (\u00a3845,000), is not among the Nobel Foundation\u2019s official awards for literature, peace, medicine, physics and chemistry, but was established separately by Sweden\u2019s central bank, Sveriges Riksbank, in memory of the Swedish chemist Alfred Nobel. The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences described Thaler as a pioneer of behavioural economics, which had progressed in recent years from a fringe and somewhat controversial field of research into a mainstream component of the economics profession. His research was praised for incorporating psychological assumptions into analyses of economic decision-making. The prize-givers said his work had shown how the limitations of an individual\u2019s knowledge in the decision-making process, as well as the consequences of social preferences and a lack of self control, can affect people\u2019s decisions as well as market outcomes. Thaler, born in New Jersey in 1945, is a career academic and a Charles R Walgreen distinguished service professor of behavioural science and economics, and the director of the Center for Decision Research at the University of Chicago\u2019s Booth School of Business. He made a cameo appearance in the 2015 film The Big Short, sitting beside Selina Gomez at a blackjack table. He is a leading proponent of \u201cnudge theory\u201d, a concept of behavioural science that suggests small interventions in the environment, or incentives, can encourage people to make different decisions. The full report is here: Here is the citation on Thaler\u2019s research on self-control: In the twelfth song of the Odyssey, Circe warns Odysseus about the Sirens, who lure sailors with their enchanting singing. Odysseus who, like his crew, wanted to return home to Ithaca, solves the problem by plugging the crew\u2019s ears with beeswax and then tying himself to the mast, with strict orders to the crew to ignore whatever he says until they are out of harm\u2019s way. Odysseus\u2019 problem is the epitome of this dilemma at all levels of our life, when we are tested by short-term temptations that threaten long-term wellbeing. This could be food and drink, smoking, consumption, saving for distant goals, or post-retirement planning. A person who chooses a longer education has a lower income during their studies, but can in return look forward to benefits in the future. Experiences that are close in time take up more of our awareness than those that are further off; a thousand krona next year is perceived as worth less than a thousand krona today, regardless of whether it is an income or an expense. In traditional economic theory this is described using discounting \u2013 the assumption is that both income and expenses reduce by a constant factor with every passing month or year. Using such an assumption, the ranking of two future alternatives will always remain the same. However, as Odysseus\u2019 dilemma demonstrates, it is possible to change your mind when choosing between two options. The explanation is that experiences that are close in time take up more of our awareness \u2013 we discount more rapidly early on. (It almost goes without saying of course, that Thaler was not one of the favourites to win the economics prize). And here is an interview with the Financial Times (\u00a3) from last year. Here\u2019s a piece from 2008 by Aditya Chakrabortty on Thaler, including how he was being wooed by the UK conservative party: Here\u2019s more from the citation on Thaler\u2019s research on fairness, complete with umbrella anecdote: When making decisions, people not only take what is beneficial to themselves into account. They also have ideas about what is fair, and they can consider other\u2019s welfare in both a positive way \u2013 through cooperation or solidarity \u2013 and a negative way \u2013 such as through jealousy or malice. Large-scale experiments conducted by Richard Thaler and other behavioural economists, have shown that notions about fairness play a major role in decision-making. People are prepared to refrain from material benefits to maintain what they perceive as just distributions. They are also prepared to bear a personal cost for punishing others who violate basic fairness rules, not only when they themselves are affected but also when they see someone else affected by injustice. One frequent objection is that results from laboratory experiments cannot be transferred to real life, but it is easy to find examples where fairness considerations have an impact outside the laboratory. Unexpected rain can create an unexpectedly high demand for umbrellas, but if a shopkeeper then raises their price to match the high demand, many consumers react negatively and feel that the shopkeeper has behaved greedily. And here is Thaler in the Big Short, with Selena Gomez: One of Thaler\u2019s theories is about \u201cmental accounting\u201d. The citation describes this as using different reference points to help make decisions, which vary from situation to situation: \u201cOne reference point could be the price for which we bought an item, or the lowest price we find when searching on the internet, and we use this reference point to assess whether we have made a \u201cgood deal\u201d. In his research, Thaler has provided numerous examples of how mental accounting using differing reference points may lead to decisions that appear strange when evaluated from a traditional economic perspective.\u201d An example: \u201cA consumer who finds out that the watch she is about to buy is 100 Swedish krona cheaper in another shop. She chooses to go to the other shop if the watch costs 1,000 krona but won\u2019t do so if it costs 10,000 krona even though the saving in krona is the same. The explanation is that she focuses on the percentage, rather than on the actual saving relative to the reference point.\u201d More on Thaler\u2019s research is here. The citation defines behavioural economics as \u201ca research field in which insights from psychological research are applied to economic decision-making. A behavioural perspective incorporates more realistic analysis of how people think and behave when making economic decisions, providing new opportunities for designing measures and institutions that increase societal benefit.\u201d The committee is asked about the lack of women winners of the Nobel prizes, and the panel says they are concerned and they are taking measures to improve the situation. They think things will improve and hope it will be different in five to ten years time. Thaler is asked about the Chinese economy, but says he is not really an expert on that. And he is now gone. He is asked about his \u201cshort Hollywood career\u201d - he was in The Big Short - saying someone successful in something is assumed to be successful going forward, and how that could apply to Donald Trump. Thaler says he is disappointed his Hollywood career was not part of the official speech giving him the award. As for Trump, he says \u201che would do well to watch that movie.\u201d Asked how he will spend the prize money, Thaler says he will try to spend it \u201cas irrationally as possible.\u201d Thaler is on the phone to the press conference now. He is asked what the most important aspect of his research is. He says it is the recognition that economic agents are human, and that economic models have to incorporate that. The citation says Thaler has incorporated psychologically realistic assumptions into analyses of economic decision-making. He has shown how the following three traits affect individual decision-making, as well as market outcomes: Limited rationality: Thaler developed the theory of mental accounting, explaining how people simplify financial decision-making by creating separate accounts in their minds, focusing on the narrow impact of each individual decision rather than its overall effect. He also showed how aversion to losses can explain why people value the same item more highly when they own it than when they don\u2019t, a phenomenon called the endowment effect. Thaler was one of the founders of the field of behavioural finance, which studies how cognitive limitations influence financial markets. Social preferences: Thaler\u2019s theoretical and experimental research on fairness has been influential. He showed how consumers\u2019 fairness concerns may stop firms from raising prices in periods of high demand, but not in times of rising costs. Thaler and his colleagues devised the dictator game, an experimental tool that has been used in numerous studies to measure attitudes to fairness in different groups of people around the world. Lack of self-control: Thaler has also shed new light on the old observation that New Year\u2019s resolutions can be hard to keep. He showed how to analyse self-control problems using a planner-doer model, which is similar to the frameworks psychologists and neuroscientists now use to describe the internal tension between long-term planning and short-term doing. Succumbing to shortterm temptation is an important reason why our plans to save for old age, or make healthier lifestyle choices, often fail. In his applied work, Thaler demonstrated how nudging \u2013 a term he coined \u2013 may help people exercise better self-control when saving for a pension, as well in other contexts. The committee said: \u201cRichard Thaler\u2019s contributions have built a bridge between the economic and psychological analyses of individual decision-making.\u201d Thaler is professor of behavioural sciences and economics at the University of Chicago. This year\u2019s prize is awarded to RIchard H Thaler for his contributions to behavourial economics. And we\u2019re off. With just a few minutes to go, here is a live link to the announcement of the Nobel Prize in Economics, which is also at the top of this blog: Rising tensions with the US have hit the Turkish lira, which tumbled around 6% at one point before recovering some ground. The US has suspended handling all regular visa applications in Turkey after a member of its embassy staff was arrested, prompting a heavy fall in the Turkish currency. The lira is currently down 2.5% at 3.7 per dollar, having touched 3.9 overnight. Hussein Sayed, chief market strategist at FXTM, said: The Turkish Lira was the worst performing currency early Monday, after the U.S. and Turkey announced the suspension of visa services for citizens looking to visit each country. Traders responded aggressively to the news, sending the Lira more than 6% lower against the U.S. currency - its steepest decline since 15 July 2016, when Turkey witnessed the bloodiest coup attempt in its political history. However, the Lira managed to recover more than half of its losses, as investors viewed the recent tensions as controllable. With Turkey increasing political ties with Russia and Iran, and Washington continuing to support Kurdish groups, the political risk premium is likely to keep pressuring the Lira. However, it would require far more escalation to see the currency trading near January lows of 3.94. Meanwhile the main Turkish stock market index, the BIST 100, has fallen 3.5%. And here\u2019s something on the only woman to win the Economics prize: Here are some facts and figures about the Nobel Prize in economics: It\u2019s striking that only one woman has won the prize since it was first awarded in 1969. And if this year\u2019s winner is indeed one of the favourites, it will remain that way. Back with the pound, and the currency is shrugging off the latest Brexit worries and political problems. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said: Sterling is using Monday\u2019s bone dry economic calendar as an opportunity to claw back some of last week\u2019s rather severe losses. One could argue that such a data-less day would only throw a harsher spotlight on the latest round of Tory turmoil. Predictably the weekend\u2019s papers were full of reports of party infighting, with one group urging Theresa May to say goodbye to Boris Johnson, and another, more Brexity cabal attacking the pro-EU Chancellor Phillip Hammond. However, sterling seems to have steeled itself somewhat over the weekend, calming the value-eroding jitters that plagued last Thursday and Friday. Perhaps the fact that nothing more dramatic happened \u2013 no resignations or comments from Johnson etc \u2013 has eased some of the currency\u2019s fears. Regardless, it is making a decent fist of taking the edge off its recent losses; cable\u2019s up 0.4%, pushing the pound back above $1.31, while its half a percent rise against the euro sees it just under \u20ac1.12. Of course, in the context the last few weeks, sterling is still struggling; the fact it has (so far) started the week on the right foot, however, is an important step on its potential road to recovery. Understandably, given its recent reliance on a weakened pound, the FTSE wasn\u2019t too enthused about the currency\u2019s comeback, though it did manage to hold above 7500 after the bell. The Eurozone indices were far perkier; the DAX hit a new high after climbing 0.3%, and is inches away from crossing 13000, while the CAC surged 0.5% to graze 5375. One notable mover in the markets in hotels group Millennium and Coptthorne. Its shares have soared 23% to 554p on news that Singapore\u2019s City Developments has offered to buy the shares in the group it does not already own. The move values M&amp;C at around \u00a31.8bn. Given City Developments already indirectly owns 65.2%, a bid for the rest should not have come as too much of a surprise to the market, but still, the offer at 552.5p a share looks generous enough. European markets have got off to a mixed start. The FTSE 100 is down 0.06%, not helped by the slight strengthening of the pound which is not helpful to the overseas earners which dominate the index. But Germany\u2019s Dax has added 0.2% and ouched a new all time high while France\u2019s Cac has edged up 0.1%. Spain\u2019s Ibex is up 0.6% despite the continuing concerns about Catalan independence. Earlier German industrial output beat expectations, rising 2.6% in August compared to a 0.1% fall in July and forecasts of a 0.7% increase. But here\u2019s a cynical reminder about predictions about the winners: Indeed last year\u2019s winners, Oliver Hart of Harvard, and Bengt Holmstr\u00f6m of MIT, were not top of the lists of likely recipients. My colleague Richard Partington has been looking at the runners and riders, who include the former governor of the Reserve Bank of India and a string of US academics. His full report is here: Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone crisis and business. We\u2019ll mainly be concentrating on the annual Nobel prize in economics, due to be announced in a few hours in Stockholm. And first things first. It comes up every year, but just to be clear, the economics prize is not one of the \u2018proper\u2019 Nobel prizes like the literature and peace awards handed out last week. Officially it is known as the Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel. It was set up by the Sveriges Riksbank (Sweden\u2019s central bank) in 1968 and is awarded by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences on the same principles as the Nobel prize. But it\u2019s still the biggest prize in economics, worth 9m Swedish kronor (\u00a3848,091) and awarded in the past to illustrious names such as John Hicks, Jan Tinbergen, John Nash, and Joseph Stiglitz, 78 in all since it was established. Last year it was won by UK-born Oliver Hart of Harvard University and Bengt Holmstr\u00f6m of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology for their work on contract theory, covering a range of issues from executive pay to public-private partnerships. It comes at a time when economists, and experts in general, have been coming under increasing pressure with the rise in populism and the dismissal by some of their worth (step forward Michael Gove for one). But with the global economy still suffering the effects of the financial crisis and the likes of Wolfgang Schaeuble warning of the prospect of another bubble, there is still a need for expert economic analysis. And we\u2019ll soon see who is deemed to be top of the field at the moment. The announcement is due around 11.45am in Sweden, or 10.45am in the UK.... Otherwise it\u2019s a fairly quiet start to the week. The pound is edging higher against the dollar after last week\u2019s declines, while stock markets are expected to be rather subdued to start with:",

Odysseus who, like his crew, wanted to return home to Ithaca, solves the problem by plugging the crew\u2019s ears with beeswax and then tying himself to the mast, with strict orders to the crew to ignore whatever he says until they are out of harm\u2019s way. Odysseus\u2019 problem is the epitome of this dilemma at all levels of our life, when we are tested by short-term temptations that threaten long-term wellbeing. This could be food and drink, smoking, consumption, saving for distant goals, or post-retirement planning. A person who chooses a longer education has a lower income during their studies, but can in return look forward to benefits in the future. </p> \n   <p>Experiences that are close in time take up more of our awareness than those that are further off; a thousand krona next year is perceived as worth less than a thousand krona today, regardless of whether it is an income or an expense. In traditional economic theory this is described using discounting \u2013 the assumption is that both income and expenses reduce by a constant factor with every passing month or year. Using such an assumption, the ranking of two future alternatives will always remain the same. </p> \n   <p>However, as Odysseus\u2019 dilemma demonstrates, it is possible to change your mind when choosing between two options. The explanation is that experiences that are close in time take up more of our awareness \u2013 we discount more rapidly early on. </p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-59db51c5e4b00593b4d681c5\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-10-09T10:39:33.231Z\">11.39am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>(It almost goes without saying of course, that Thaler was not one of the favourites to win the economics prize).</p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-59db5188e4b00593b4d681c3\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-10-09T10:38:42.750Z\">11.38am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>And here is <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/8e150180-3d83-11e6-9f2c-36b487ebd80a\">an interview </a>with the Financial Times (\u00a3) from last year.</p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-59db5059e4b00593b4d681c0\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-10-09T10:37:22.172Z\">11.37am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Here\u2019s a piece from 2008 by Aditya Chakrabortty on Thaler, including how he was being wooed by the UK conservative party:</p> \n  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n   <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/jul/12/economy.conservatives\">From Obama to Cameron, why do so many politicians want a piece of Richard Thaler?</a> </p> \n  </aside> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-59db4f2ce4b076f91939cd10\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-10-09T10:30:37.737Z\">11.30am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Here\u2019s more from the citation on Thaler\u2019s research on fairness, complete with umbrella anecdote:</p> \n  <blockquote> \n   <p>When making decisions, people not only take what is beneficial to themselves into account. They also have ideas about what is fair, and they can consider other\u2019s welfare in both a positive way \u2013 through cooperation or solidarity \u2013 and a negative way \u2013 such as through jealousy or malice. Large-scale experiments conducted by Richard Thaler and other behavioural economists, have shown that notions about fairness play a major role in decision-making. People are prepared to refrain from material benefits to maintain what they perceive as just distributions. They are also prepared to bear a personal cost for punishing others who violate basic fairness rules, not only when they themselves are affected but also when they see someone else affected by injustice. </p> \n   <p>One frequent objection is that results from laboratory experiments cannot be transferred to real life, but it is easy to find examples where fairness considerations have an impact outside the laboratory. Unexpected rain can create an unexpectedly high demand for umbrellas, but if a shopkeeper then raises their price to match the high demand, many consumers react negatively and feel that the shopkeeper has behaved greedily. </p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-59db4ec7e4b076f91939cd0e\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-10-09T10:26:34.349Z\">11.26am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>And here is Thaler in the Big Short, with Selena Gomez:</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/PaciorekMagda/status/917332227087831040\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"pl\" dir=\"ltr\">Noblista Richard Thaler wyst\u0105pi\u0142 w jednej ze scen filmu The Big Short.

He has shown how the following three traits affect individual decision-making, as well as market outcomes:</p> \n  <blockquote> \n   <p><strong>Limited rationality:</strong> Thaler developed the theory of <em>mental accounting,</em> explaining how people simplify financial decision-making by creating separate accounts in their minds, focusing on the narrow impact of each individual decision rather than its overall effect. He also showed how aversion to losses can explain why people value the same item more highly when they own it than when they don\u2019t, a phenomenon called the endowment effect. Thaler was one of the founders of the field of <em>behavioural finance,</em> which studies how cognitive limitations influence financial markets.</p> \n   <p><strong>Social preferences:</strong> Thaler\u2019s theoretical and experimental research on <em>fairness</em> has been influential. He showed how consumers\u2019 fairness concerns may stop firms from raising prices in periods of high demand, but not in times of rising costs. Thaler and his colleagues devised the <em>dictator game,</em> an experimental tool that has been used in numerous studies to measure attitudes to fairness in different groups of people around the world.</p> \n   <p><strong>Lack of self-control:</strong> Thaler has also shed new light on the old observation that New Year\u2019s resolutions can be hard to keep. He showed how to analyse self-control problems using a <em>planner-doer model, </em>which is similar to the frameworks psychologists and neuroscientists now use to describe the internal tension between long-term planning and short-term doing. Succumbing to shortterm temptation is an important reason why our plans to save for old age, or make healthier lifestyle choices, often fail.

Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Sterling is using Monday\u2019s bone dry economic calendar as an opportunity to claw back some of last week\u2019s rather severe losses.</p> \n   <p>One could argue that such a data-less day would only throw a harsher spotlight on the latest round of Tory turmoil. Predictably the weekend\u2019s papers were full of reports of party infighting, with one group urging Theresa May to say goodbye to Boris Johnson, and another, more Brexity cabal attacking the pro-EU Chancellor Phillip Hammond.</p> \n   <p>However, sterling seems to have steeled itself somewhat over the weekend, calming the value-eroding jitters that plagued last Thursday and Friday. Perhaps the fact that nothing more dramatic happened \u2013 no resignations or comments from Johnson etc \u2013 has eased some of the currency\u2019s fears.</p> \n   <p>Regardless, it is making a decent fist of taking the edge off its recent losses; cable\u2019s up 0.4%, pushing the pound back above $1.31, while its half a percent rise against the euro sees it just under \u20ac1.12. Of course, in the context the last few weeks, sterling is still struggling; the fact it has (so far) started the week on the right foot, however, is an important step on its potential road to recovery.</p> \n   <p>Understandably, given its recent reliance on a weakened pound, the FTSE wasn\u2019t too enthused about the currency\u2019s comeback, though it did manage to hold above 7500 after the bell. The Eurozone indices were far perkier; the DAX hit a new high after climbing 0.3%, and is inches away from crossing 13000, while the CAC surged 0.5% to graze 5375.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-59db2649e4b076f91939cc59\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-10-09T07:33:32.903Z\">8.33am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/YiannisBab/status/917289372227006464\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">It's fake Nobel prize day everybody! <a href=\"https://t.co/34lK2jPsU5\">pic.twitter.com/34lK2jPsU5</a></p>\u2014 Yiannis \u0392aboulias (@YiannisBab) \n    <a href=\"https://twitter.com/YiannisBab/status/917289372227006464?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">October 9, 2017</a>\n   </blockquote> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-59db242ae4b076f91939cc52\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-10-09T07:28:27.281Z\">8.28am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Millennium and Copthorne jumps 23%</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>One notable mover in the markets in hotels group Millennium and Coptthorne.</p> \n  <p>Its shares have soared 23% to 554p on news that Singapore\u2019s City Developments has offered to buy the shares in the group it does not already own.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The number of rail passenger journeys in Britain fell in spring this year, after two decades of virtually constant growth since privatisation. Analysts and industry observers said the figures were concerning, while Labour said it raised serious questions about the viability of franchises. Figures from the Office of Rail and Road show that the total number of journeys was 416m from April through to the end of June, a decline of 2.7% compared with the same period last year. Journeys by passengers using season tickets fell by 11% year on year, with many switching to advance purchase tickets. Commuter journeys in London and the south-east fell by 4.5%, including a drop of 8.8% on South West Trains (now South Western Railway), 5.3% on the troubled Govia Thameslink Railway (owner of Southern rail) and 7.4% on Southeastern. The shadow transport secretary, Andy McDonald, said: \u201cThis substantial fall in rail usage reflects passenger frustration at the cost and inflexibility of the ticketing system and direction of the railway more broadly.\u201d Average fares have risen 27% since 2010, far faster than wages, while another 3.6% rise is due in January. McDonald added: \u201cThe decline in patronage, particularly in the south-east, raises serious questions about the government\u2019s rail franchising programme which is based on ever increasing rail patronage. I don\u2019t believe the current model can sustain a downturn.\u201d Industry sources said it called into question the sums paid for recent franchises. One said: \u201cThe whole franchising model is predicated on growth. At a time when firms have paid massive premiums, they have got to be worried.\u201d The rail industry has faced the spectre of failing franchises before as two private firms walked away from the east coast mainline between 2007 and 2009, leaving it to the government to run after they failed to meet revenue predictions. Stagecoach, which has run the Virgin Trains East Coast franchise since 2015, has taken a \u00a384m hit and attempted to renegotiate the terms of its deal after passenger growth fell below forecasts. Gerald Khoo, an analyst at Liberum Capital, said of the passenger figures: \u201cThis is potentially concerning for operators who have won franchises recently if they have assumed much faster growth.\u201d Abellio promised \u00a33.7bn for the Greater Anglia franchise, which it started less than a year ago. First Group retained the TransPennine Express franchise last year with a bid that analysts said assumed passenger growth of between 13% and 18% a year from its second year, but numbers have so far remained static. In conjunction with MTR, it pledged to pay \u00a32.6bn for the South Western franchise it took over in August.

      "bodyText": "Almost a million hospitality staff are among workers at risk of a retirement in poverty, a study of blackspots in the government\u2019s flagship pensions policy has shown. According to the TUC, as many as six in 10 workers in low-paid sectors such as retail and agriculture are not enrolled in a pension. They slip through the net of the government\u2019s pensions auto-enrolment system as they earn less than the \u00a310,000 minimum level at which employers are forced to set them up with a savings plan. Launched five years ago in one of the biggest shakeups for pensions in recent memory, auto-enrolment was introduced by the government to boost levels of saving for retirement. More than 8m employees have signed up for a workplace pension since, according to official figures. But workers in low-paid sectors appear not to be receiving the same level of contributions from their employers as those at the top. As many as nine out of 10 savers in the wholesale and retail industries received less than 8% of salary from their employer. In high-paid sectors such as financial services, the vast majority of savers received more than this amount. The TUC general secretary, Frances O\u2019Grady, said: \u201cMillions remain at risk of poverty in retirement because they are saving nothing, or very little, in a pension scheme. We urgently need the government to help more low-paid workers join schemes. And ministers must set out a plan for increasing contributions from employers.\u201d The industries with the lowest level of pension cover are agriculture, forestry and fishing, hospitality, construction, arts and entertainment, and other services such as hairdressing and beauty. The TUC said nearly 9m workers in total were unable to save into a pension scheme due to low pay. A spokesperson for the Department for Work and Pensions said: \u201cMore than 8.5 million people are now enrolled into a workplace pension, thanks to the introduction of automatic enrolment. \u201cBut we know there is more to do, which is why our review is looking at who is eligible and the evidence around future contribution increases, to ensure as many people as possible are saving towards their retirement.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "A civil war is brewing in the normally convivial craft beer fraternity, as anxiety grows about the threat posed by multinational companies\u2019 insatiable thirst for every last drop of the market. Heineken and Molson Coors are both \u201cassociate members\u201d of the Society of Independent Brewers (Siba), a situation that rankles with some of its members. In a recent ballot on the issue, they voted 101 to 60 to end the situation, but the motion did not carry because change requires a majority of all 861 members to vote in favour, and most did not turn up to do so. The fact that \u201cbig beer\u201d retained its foot in the craft camp proved the last straw for Ali Kocho-Williams of the Pembrokeshire-based microbrewery Seren Brewing, who quit Siba after the vote. \u201cThe problem is that it co-opts an organisation that\u2019s supposed to be looking out for independent brewers into the pocket of big companies that want to assault the craft industry. \u201cYou can\u2019t be anti-monopoly and then get into bed with them. Siba want to have their cake and eat it.\u201d In an apparent hint that the organisation\u2019s policy could be about to change, its membership director, Tony Jerome, said Siba would \u201cconsider new proposals in the near future\u201d. Even if the big boys of brewing are shown the door, however, misgivings will persist. Heineken and Molson along with Budweiser\u2019s owner, AB InBev (ABI), and Carlsberg have teamed up with Siba to provide funding for the \u201cThere\u2019s a Beer for That\u201d campaign, an industry-wide promotional initiative. \u201cThey should be nowhere near anything that we do as they are the complete antithesis of everything we stand for,\u201d said Tom McNeill of Heavy Industry Brewing in Denbighshire, north Wales. Craft beer aficionados have good reason to mistrust major brewers beyond a distaste for bland beer. Heineken is persona non grata among some pub owners after its deal to buy thousands of pubs via a takeover of Punch Taverns, a deal many fear will lead to less choice at the bar. The Dutch company was also fined for market abuse in Greece, where it was found guilty of trying to exclude smaller competitors from the market. Carlsberg recently muscled in on the UK craft beer scene with a deal for London Fields Brewery, and Molson has also shown an appetite for smaller rivals in the US. It\u2019s a trend that makes indie brewers break out in a cold, barley-scented sweat. Nor is Siba alone in hosting unlikely bedfellows. The Campaign for Real Ale (Camra), the collective that thumps the tub for cask ale, accepted sponsorship for its Great British Beer Festival from the delivery company Beer Hawk. The conflict was not apparent until it became clear that Beer Hawk is owned by ABI, a company that invites perhaps more suspicion than any other among beer lovers. ABI agreed a $100bn (\u00a376bn) deal to take over its only real rival SABMiller last year but has not rested on its laurels. The company\u2019s thirst to dominate the global beer market is nothing short of relentless, evidenced by its determination to swallow up much of what moves in the beer world. In the UK, it is most famous for taking over Camden Town Brewery, a deal some brewers fear will ultimately diminish the brand\u2019s quality and innovation. Camden was just the latest domino to fall in a chain of craft breweries ABI has snapped up for its High End portfolio, but its horizons stretch far further. RateBeer is a smartphone app that lets pub-goers rate brews as they drink them, sharing reviews and bookmarking tipples they might forget in the fug of the morning after. ABI bought a minority stake earlier this year and, while there is nothing to suggest it will be able to tamper with ratings, many users are unhappy. Their concerns are particularly acute given that ABI accounts for half of the 20 worst-rated beers on RateBeer. It has also tightened its grip on the international supply of key ingredients. Buying SABMiller saw ABI annex vast swaths of South African hop fields that produce sought-after varieties. These will be now be diverted exclusively to \u201ccraft\u201d brands within the ABI estate, affecting rivals\u2019 ability to make interesting new brews. ABI has also opened a bar in Balham under its Goose Island brand, with more UK outlets expected to follow. That puts it in direct competition not only with pubs, but also with up-and-coming British breweries which rely on income from their tap-house bars to keep going. Less sociable drinkers who would rather order beer to consume on their sofa than set foot in a pub may find it equally hard to avoid ABI thanks to its ownership of Beer Hawk, a deal that saw its rival Honest Brew warn that big companies are hiding behind craft labels to trick consumers. Concerns about ABI\u2019s grip on larger scale distribution in the US even attracted the attention of the Department of Justice, which forced the company to stop practices limiting the ability of smaller rivals to distribute their wares. Practices like these make it easy to understand why craft brewers might see their larger rivals as an existential threat. Some now feel that those who are supposed to represent their interests are increasingly complicit in the big brewers\u2019 efforts to choke off or co-opt the so-called craft beer revolution. Siba and Camra might well look at the history of revolutions and remember that it doesn\u2019t always end well for their leaders.",

It\u2019s a trend that makes indie brewers break out in a cold, barley-scented sweat.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/jul/11/indie-brewers-fight-back-in-bitter-row-over-beer-brands-craft-credentials\">Indie brewers fight back in bitter row over beer brands' craft credentials</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Nor is Siba alone in hosting unlikely bedfellows. The <a href=\"http://www.camra.org.uk/\">Campaign for Real Ale (Camra)</a>, the collective that thumps the tub for cask ale, accepted sponsorship for its Great British Beer Festival from the delivery company Beer Hawk.</p> <p>The conflict was not apparent until it became clear that Beer Hawk is owned by ABI, a company that invites perhaps more suspicion than any other among beer lovers.</p> <p>ABI agreed a $100bn (\u00a376bn) deal to take over its only real rival SABMiller last year but has not rested on its laurels. The company\u2019s thirst to dominate the global beer market is nothing short of relentless, evidenced by its determination to swallow up much of what moves in the beer world.</p> <p>In the UK, it is most famous for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/dec/23/why-camden-town-brewery-sale-craft-beer\">taking over Camden Town Brewery</a>, a deal some brewers fear will <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/jul/11/indie-brewers-fight-back-in-bitter-row-over-beer-brands-craft-credentials\">ultimately diminish the brand\u2019s quality and innovation</a>. Camden was just the latest domino to fall in a chain of craft breweries ABI has snapped up for its High End portfolio, but its horizons stretch far further.</p> <p>RateBeer is a smartphone app that lets pub-goers rate brews as they drink them, sharing reviews and bookmarking tipples they might forget in the fug of the morning after. ABI bought a minority stake earlier this year and, while there is nothing to suggest it will be able to tamper with ratings, <a href=\"https://www.ratebeer.com/forums/ratebeer-sells-to-ab-inbev_296261.htmhttps://www.ratebeer.com/Ratings/TheWorstBeers.asp\">many users are unhappy</a>.</p> <p>Their concerns are particularly acute given that ABI accounts for half of the 20 worst-rated beers on RateBeer.</p> <p>It has also tightened its grip on the international supply of key ingredients. Buying SABMiller saw ABI <a href=\"https://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2017/05/ab-inbev-just-commandeered-the-entire-south-africa.html\">annex vast swaths of South African hop fields</a> that produce sought-after varieties. These will be now be diverted exclusively to \u201ccraft\u201d brands within the ABI estate, affecting rivals\u2019 ability to make interesting new brews.</p> <p>ABI has also <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2016/12/01/ab-inbev-taps-craft-beer-boom-opening-first-london-pub-goose/\">opened a bar in Balham</a> under its Goose Island brand, with more UK outlets expected to follow. That puts it in direct competition not only with pubs, but also with up-and-coming British breweries which rely on income from their tap-house bars to keep going.</p> <p>Less sociable drinkers who would rather order beer to consume on their sofa than set foot in a pub may find it equally hard to avoid ABI thanks to its <a href=\"https://www.beerhawk.co.uk/blog/some-exciting-news-for-you-beer-lovers\">ownership of Beer Hawk</a>, a deal that saw its rival Honest Brew warn that big companies are hiding behind craft labels to trick consumers.</p> <p>Concerns about ABI\u2019s grip on larger scale distribution in the US even <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-abinbev-doj-antitrust-exclusive-idUSKCN0S623R20151012\">attracted the attention of the Department of Justice</a>, which forced the company to stop practices limiting the ability of smaller rivals to distribute their wares.</p> <p>Practices like these make it easy to understand why craft brewers might see their larger rivals as an existential threat. Some now feel that those who are supposed to represent their interests are increasingly complicit in the big brewers\u2019 efforts to choke off or co-opt the so-called craft beer revolution.</p> <p>Siba and Camra might well look at the history of revolutions and remember that it doesn\u2019t always end well for their leaders.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The shadow finance minister, Jim Chalmers, will warn that Australia is \u201cdangerously ill-prepared\u201d for technological changes revolutionising employment, and argue that the Labor party must focus on finding a fair distribution of the benefits of the new machine age. Chalmers will use the annual John Button lecture on Monday night to argue that policymakers need to ensure \u201cpeople aren\u2019t left behind when the nature of work changes\u201d and also to ensure \u201cthe benefits of the new machine age are distributed widely and not just concentrated in the hands of the few\u201d. \u201cWe can\u2019t use unpredictability as an excuse to do nothing,\u201d Chalmers will argue. \u201cWe can\u2019t just throw up our hands because the challenge might seem too hard.\u201d He says policy paralysis will expose Australians to the potential pitfalls of technological change and leave them unable to grasp the benefits. Chalmers, who has written a book about technological disruption with the former telco boss Mike Quigley, says the rise of machines, automation and artificial intelligence is happening at a time when economies are still unwinding from the effects of the global financial crisis. In the Button lecture, he will note wages growth in Australia is low, living standards are declining, underemployment is at or near historic highs, \u201cGDP has a one in front of it\u201d, and Australia has record gross and net debt. He says voter discontent with politics, while not a new phenomenon, is fed by perceptions of division and polarisation \u201cand a prime minister more focused on shoring up his position in the party room than showing some leadership \u2013 on energy, on marriage equality, on anything\u201d. He says Labor needs to persist with ambitious policy rather than a small-target political strategy and \u201cresist the temptation to be the gleeful spectators at the federal political circus\u201d. \u201cWe want to be more substantial than the proverbial last angry paragraph of a news story,\u201d Chalmers will say. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to be the lesser of two evils. \u201cWe are determined to enter government via the front door of substantial policy work, not sneak through the back door of despair or disappointment with our opponents\u2019 failures.\u201d Chalmers says Labor policy needs to grapple with the big upsides and the big challenges of the next industrial revolution, starting with reforms to education. He says restoring full needs-based funding for schools \u201cwill combat technological inequality\u201d, and lifelong learning is essential to ensuring participation in an evolving labour market. Policies such as income smoothing could help with peaks and troughs in employment \u201cwhether that\u2019s through supplementing income once a displaced worker is forced to accept a far lower-paying job, or incentives to encourage workers to take out wage insurance.\u201d He will say: \u201cWorkers in the gig economy, or those working several jobs at once, will need to be able to pool or take their entitlements with them. Portable entitlements will give those in insecure work the opportunity to save for retirement and insure against sickness or other risks. \u201cIn a world where some jobs will become obsolete, we\u2019ll also need to help workers find completely new jobs. Labour market programs focused on the skills people have, not just the occupations they have filled, could make a big difference here.\u201d",

McDonald\u2019s, which in its press release for the promotion said that the sauce release would be \u201creally, really limited\u201d, has apologised to fans that missed out.
