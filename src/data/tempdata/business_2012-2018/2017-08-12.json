Just look at the tourist regions of the UK. Cornwall is a major tourist area, but its economy is one of the weakest in Europe. EU investments, together with \u201cmatched funding\u201d, have injected around \u00a31.5bn into the region, but this has had little impact on raising GDP. One of the biggest stumbling blocks has been the perception by successive governments that the Cornish economy is synonymous with tourism, with its focus on unskilled, low-paid and part-item employment. Cornwall is being directed to build 52,500 houses before 2020. A large proportion of these will be bought as holiday homes or by people retiring to Cornwall. This large-scale \u201cimmigration\u201d has vastly distorted the housing market. People employed in tourism cannot afford these houses. Perhaps Cornwall\u2019s perversity in delivering a very large pro-Brexit vote was because there are so many middle-class retired incomers who are putting stress on the social and health services . Tourism is supposed to generate billions of pounds, but very little of this \u201csticks\u201d in Cornwall because much of it goes to the major supermarkets, which employ unskilled people on low pay. Government (and the Cornish will not forget the Brexiters\u2019 claims that EU funding would be replaced by central government) must encourage high-value opportunities, such as those within the digital industries that are beginning to grow in Cornwall. And perhaps government should improve the social and health services, digital connectivity and rail and air infrastructure, rather than pumping more money into roads that primarily serve tourists.

      "bodyText": "This week two surveys on the economy showed very different views. The first on business confidence suggests a booming economy, the second on consumer confidence suggests an ongoing level of pessimism. Rather than realise that consumers might be feeling the pinch of declining real wages, business leaders blamed the divergent views on government uncertainty, while business groups argued for changes to industrial relations that will only serve to keep the divergence in place. For businesses, things are looking pretty schmick. The July NAB Business survey released this week saw its business confidence index increase by four points in July, to be at +12 index points, which, the report noted \u201cis twice the long-run average and similar to its pre-GFC levels.\u201d On the measure of business conditions, things were equally as shiny and happy. That measure rose by 1 point in June to hit +15 index points, which is three times the long-run average and the highest level observed since early 2008. For consumers, the shininess is less evident. The results of the Westpac-Melbourne Institute\u2019s measure of consumer sentiment released this week showed that July recorded a level of 95.5 \u2013 where 100 is the point where the number of pessimistic consumers is equal with the number of optimists. It marked the ninth straight month where pessimists outnumbers optimists. Such an outcome should not be a surprise to anyone who has been paying attention. Whether it be record low wages growth, record levels of debt, the prices of essentials rising faster than wages, housing affordability falling, or household incomes remaining flat for six years, there is little around at the moment to suggest consumers should feel like breaking out the wallets is a smart thing to do. Yes, employment has been growing solidly \u2013 with even full-time employment growing after disappearing in 2016. But the very strong impression is that this employment growth is mostly off the back of ongoing \u2013 and likely to continue \u2013 low wages growth. Low wages growth is not surprising when the economy is weak. No one expects record wages growth at a time when unemployment is rising. The experience over the past decade has also been that our industrial relations system is such that when economic conditions are weak, employers will now cut back hours rather than sack workers \u2013 certainly a better outcome than in the past. However, what we have now is a period where business conditions are kicking along nicely but workers \u2013 to quote the governor of the Reserve Bank, Philip Lowe, in his statement to the House economics committee on Friday \u2013 are \u201cgetting used to lower growth in their real wages\u201d. Lowe suggested that \u201cmany now see this as more than just a temporary development, with wage increases of two point something per cent now the norm\u201d. And you wonder why consumers are not feeling as optimistic as businesses? But while for most people this difference of sentiment is easily understood, for some business leaders the fault lies with the government. Virgin chief executive John Borghetti and the chief executive of Orora, Nigel Garrard, told the Australian Financial Review the problem was \u201cuncertainty\u201d. Borghetti suggested \u201cuncertain leadership always causes instability\u201d while Garrard suggested \u201cthere\u2019s uncertainty on a whole lot of levels in an economy where there\u2019s a lot of political uncertainty\u201d. There is almost nothing more certain than business leaders blaming things on government uncertainty. Whenever an election rolls around, there\u2019s always a line of business representatives ready to bemoan that the democratic electoral system of our country is creating uncertainty, because, perish the thought, there might be a change of government. And while there is a case to be made that we do need some certainly on areas such as energy policy \u2013 that is something businesses care about more than consumers. Consumers care more that the price they pay for energy is rising by more than their wages than any uncertainty over the government\u2019s policy over the energy market. But too often when business leaders talk about uncertainty from the government, what they really are complaining about is the lack of certainty that worker\u2019s rights will be curtailed. This week the Minerals Council of Australia released a discussion paper arguing for, among other things, a reduction the ability for workers to strike because apparently the Fair Work Act had swung the pendulum too far in unions\u2019 favour. This is despite the most recent figures showing that in past 12 months the 122,200 working days lost to industrial action is lower than the average of 134,000 lost during the Work Choices period. Low wages growth, low levels of industrial disputes, business conditions that are as good as they have been for nearly a decade. And yet the continued response from businesses are for more changes that will only serve to reduce the bargaining power of workers, keep wages growth down, and as a result keep consumer confidence low. And all the while you can be certain they\u2019ll blame everyone else and complain that they need more changes to keep that situation entrenched.",

It recently hit the headlines when a study from estate agents Countrywide identified it as the \u201cflipping capital\u201d of Britain, with almost one in 10 homes in the Lancashire town being sold multiple times in just one year. Colin Haslam, a senior branch manager for Countrywide, says there is a fair amount of that going on, with investors taking advantage of relatively low prices to buy houses, make some improvements and sell them on. But there are plenty of other factors pushing up prices and keeping the market buoyant. \u201cWe also see lots of investors from the south of England, and local investors who are buying to rent out,\u201d says Haslam. First-time buyers are also drawn to Burnley by its relatively low prices and a recently reopened train link to Manchester Victoria. \u201cI could sell modern semis all day long, there is so much demand,\u201d says Haslam. \u201cThey go from \u00a3110,000 up to \u00a3160,000. For that you would expect mortgage repayments of around \u00a3550 a month, but to rent you are looking at \u00a3700 a month for the same property.\u201d Haslam expects the market in and around Burnley to remain pretty much stable. \u201cWe saw a slowdown after the election,\u201d he says, \u201cbut it is beginning to pick up again now.\u201d He also thinks that a lack of supply will mean property prices keep rising. \u201cOut of five houses I sold last week, three went in excess of the asking price because there was more than one buyer interested.\u201d THE MOST EXPENSIVE: KENSINGTON On the official measure, house prices are still rising year-on-year in Kensington, the west London enclave that is the most expensive borough in the country at an average of \u00a31.5m per property. But agents around London say the market has been weighed down by higher stamp duty rates, changes in tax on buy-to-let properties, and Brexit. Kit Allen, a director in the Kensington branch of Savills estate agency, echoes that analysis: \u201cVolume has certainly dropped compared with 2014 \u2013 and the time for a sale to be achieved now stretches up to 12 months, and in some cases longer, and this inevitably leads to weaker pricing.\u201d Allen says the Brexit vote has hit appetites for homes in Kensington, an area long popular with people working in banking and finance. \u201cEffectively, what Brexit has done is it is has thrown a large number of them on to hold, because they simply don\u2019t know where their job is going to be,\u201d he says. When last summer\u2019s referendum sent the pound tumbling against other currencies, some analysts predicted a house price bubble in London, as foreign investors took advantage of the exchange rate to snap up properties. A year on, Allen has not seen much evidence of that: \u201cIt\u2019s not just a question of currency gains on exchange rates - it\u2019s about confidence in the UK and its future.\u201d Looking ahead, he expects the Brexit process to continue to weigh on the housing market: \u201cI think it\u2019s going to be very lumpy over the next 18 months during these negotiations.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Britain\u2019s housing market has hit the buffers as political uncertainty, stamp duty changes and squeezed household incomes all dampen buyer demand. Over the past week, Britain\u2019s biggest mortgage lender, Halifax, said that annual house price growth had slowed to the weakest rate in four years and the official surveyors\u2019 body said that activity was back to 2011 levels in some parts of the UK. The Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (Rics) said a large majority of surveyors in both London and south-east England were reporting falling prices, though the national picture is balanced by price rises in the West Midlands, the south-west and Northern Ireland. Homeowners who have enjoyed rising prices for years should get used to slower rates of growth or even a drop in the value of their home, say property market experts. But a generation of renters who have felt cut off from the property ladder by increasingly unaffordable prices will be relieved to see the market cool off. We take a look at the housing market around the country and ask where things go from here. Prices Homeowners have so far escaped the house price crash that some forecasters, including the International Monetary Fund, had warned could happen in the event of a Brexit vote. But the housing market has slowed markedly since the referendum. In the run-up to last summer\u2019s vote, house prices had been rising by around 8% each year. More recently, year-on-year growth has fallen below 5%, as measured by the Office for National Statistics. Other measures put house price growth significantly below that. For anyone trying to get a grip on the UK property market, there are a baffling number of house price trackers to wade through. The Halifax measure, closely followed by economists, said prices in the three months to July were 2.1% higher than in the same quarter a year earlier. That was lower than in June (2.6%) and the slowest annual rate since April 2013. Revealing those figures last week, Russell Galley, managing director at Halifax Community Bank, said sluggish wage growth and rising inflation were weighing on house prices. \u201cThis squeeze on spending power, together with the impact on property transactions of the stamp duty changes in 2016 now being realised, along with affordability concerns, appear to have contributed to weaker housing demand,\u201d he said. Data on rental prices is more patchy. Rental prices rose by 1.1% in July compared with the same month a year ago, the first increase seen for three months, according to HomeLet, an insurance company that compiles a monthly lettings market tracker. It put the average monthly rent at \u00a3925. Estate agent Your Move reported rents were up 2.1% on the year in June, with the average rent for England and Wales at \u00a3827. The London market In the aftermath of the Brexit referendum in June 2016, the prime London property market was seen as one of the big beneficiaries of the vote to leave. The assumption was that the fall in the value of the pound would make a des res in Mayfair, Belgravia or Chelsea more affordable for foreign buyers. It hasn\u2019t worked out like that. The London market, according to Rics, is heading south faster than any other region of the UK. Prices are falling, sales are weak and instructions from new sellers are drying up. There are a number of reasons for the tough market conditions in the capital. Half the buy-to-let transactions in the UK are accounted for by London, and these have fallen sharply since the introduction of new stamp duty rules in April 2016. The previous jump in prices in the years leading up to the EU referendum had meant home ownership was simply too expensive for those working in the capital, so some form of market correction was inevitable. The uncertainty caused by Brexit has provided the catalyst. HomeLet said rent rises in London continued to lag the UK as a whole, falling by 0.6% in July compared with a year earlier. The average monthly rent in the capital was now \u00a31,564, it added. Activity Economists have highlighted declining sales as evidence that the housing market has cooled. They fell 3% between May and June to 96,910, the lowest level since October 2016, according to HMRC data. Rics said in its latest update that buyer demand had failed to show any meaningful growth since last November and that the flow of fresh listings was deteriorating, so that average stock levels on estate agents\u2019 books were close to record lows. Fionnuala Earley, chief economist at Countrywide, the UK\u2019s largest estate agency group, says fewer people believe it is a good time to move house. \u201cAt the moment, it\u2019s a needs-based market rather than desire-based and the factors behind that are squeezed household incomes and expectations about future house prices,\u201d she said. \u201cWe see people improving rather than moving. They are saying, \u2018Can I get a loft conversion done rather than pay the stamp duty?\u2019\u201d Mortgage rates Traditionally, the UK housing market softens when interest rates are raised in an attempt to prevent overheating. But not this time. As the Bank of England pointed out in its latest inflation report, mortgage rates are about as low as they have ever been. Someone who wants to borrow 90% of the value of the property they are buying can do so at 2.5% fixed for two years, down from 4.1% between 2013 and 2015, and 6% in the immediate aftermath of the financial crisis between 2009 and 2012. A two-year fixed-rate 75% loan-to-value mortgage is available at 1.5%, compared with 3.7% in the post-crisis period. These low rates may not last forever, however. Hints from the Bank of England that it is thinking of raising borrowing costs for the first time in a decade are already having an impact. Interest rates charged in the financial markets have edged up as a result and this will eventually filter through into higher mortgage rates. Threadneedle Street has made it clear that when official interest rates are finally raised, the increases will be slow and measured. The Bank is worried that too sharp a rise could lead to financial distress for those who have borrowed large sums to get on the housing ladder. Supply A key factor propping up house prices is the longstanding mismatch between supply and demand. Nearly 190,000 homes were built in 2015-16, an eight-year high, but that was still far short of the 300,000 a year needed to meet demand, according to the Lords economic affairs committee when it looked into the housing crisis last year. The Conservative party pledged in its latest election manifesto to meet a 2015 commitment to deliver a million homes by the end of 2020 and 500,000 more by the end of 2022. But Earley at Countrywide said that would not be enough to make up the past shortfall. \u201cSo we\u2019ve still got that spectre over the market and it\u2019s supportive of house prices,\u201d she said. The Local Government Association, which represents more than 370 local authorities in England and Wales, is calling for councils to have more powers and funding, in order to resume their historical role as significant builders of affordable homes. The homelessness charity Shelter also wants to see a shake-up. \u201cOur current model of housebuilding simply isn\u2019t delivering the affordable homes we desperately need \u2013 it allows big developers to make millions while ordinary families face colossal housing costs,\u201d said Anne Baxendale, Shelter\u2019s director of communications, policy and campaigns. \u201cThe government needs to introduce a fresh new way of building homes which brings down the huge cost of land and delivers genuinely affordable and high-quality homes that millions of families are crying out for.\u201d The government says it is working on the problem. \u201cWe\u2019re investing \u00a37.1bn to build more affordable homes,\u201d said a spokesman for the Department for Communities and Local Government. \u201cWe\u2019ve already helped more than 400,000 households into home ownership through government-backed schemes since 2010, and the number of first-time buyers is at a nine-year annual high.\u201d The outlook Both Halifax and Nationwide say a lack of homes on the market will continue to support house prices in coming months. Rics is predicting flat prices and rents for at least the next year. The Rics survey of agents, covering 538 branches, found that for the next 12 months, a net balance of 28% anticipate an increase in prices. But that was the least positive reading since last July, immediately after the EU referendum. Countrywide\u2019s Earley sees downside risks for house prices from a Brexit-related rise in unemployment and from the Bank of England raising interest rates. On the other hand, there is an upside risk following a period of subdued activity. \u201cThe longer that we have got low transactions, the more pent-up demand we have. When confidence returns, things could pick up more quickly,\u201d said Earley. \u201cI don\u2019t expect big falls in house prices but on the other side I don\u2019t expect there to be big increases in incomes to push house prices up significantly.\u201d Martin Beck at consultancy Oxford Economics said there was a lack of drivers to push up house price growth but equally an absence of the kind of forces which have typically caused prices to fall. \u201cUK house price growth is running out of steam. And with household incomes squeezed and the affordability of housing stretched, we think a prolonged period of very modest growth lies ahead. But the prospect of a crash is remote,\u201d he said.",

As the Bank of England <a href=\"http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/Pages/inflationreport/2017/aug.aspx\" title=\"\">pointed out in its latest inflation report</a>, mortgage rates are about as low as they have ever been.</p> <p>Someone who wants to borrow 90% of the value of the property they are buying can do so at 2.5% fixed for two years, down from 4.1% between 2013 and 2015, and 6% in the immediate aftermath of the financial crisis between 2009 and 2012. A two-year fixed-rate 75% loan-to-value mortgage is available at 1.5%, compared with 3.7% in the post-crisis period.</p> <p>These low rates may not last forever, however. Hints from the Bank of England that it is thinking of raising borrowing costs for the first time in a decade are already having an impact. Interest rates charged in the financial markets have edged up as a result and this will eventually filter through into higher mortgage rates.</p> <p>Threadneedle Street has made it clear that when official interest rates are finally raised, the increases will be slow and measured. The Bank is worried that too sharp a rise could lead to financial distress for those who have borrowed large sums to get on the housing ladder.</p> <h2><strong>Supply</strong></h2> <p><strong> </strong></p> <p>A key factor propping up house prices is the longstanding mismatch between supply and demand. <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/568403/Housing_Supply_England_2015-16.pdf\" title=\"\">Nearly 190,000 homes</a> were built in 2015-16, an eight-year high, but that was still far short of the <a href=\"https://www.parliament.uk/business/committees/committees-a-z/lords-select/economic-affairs-committee/news-parliament-2015/housing-report-publication/\" title=\"\">300,000 a year</a> needed to meet demand, according to the Lords economic affairs committee when it looked into the housing crisis last year.</p> <p>The Conservative party pledged in its latest election manifesto to meet a 2015 commitment to deliver a million homes by the end of 2020 and 500,000 more by the end of 2022.</p> <p>But Earley at Countrywide said that would not be enough to make up the past shortfall. \u201cSo we\u2019ve still got that spectre over the market and it\u2019s supportive of house prices,\u201d she said.</p> <p>The Local Government Association, which represents more than 370 local authorities in England and Wales, is calling for councils to have more powers and funding, in order to resume their historical role as significant builders of affordable homes.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/aug/2017-08-11T16:41:38/embed.html\" data-alt=\"Housing stocks\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/aug/2017-08-11T16:41:38/embed.html\">Housing stocks</a> </figure>  <p>The homelessness charity Shelter also wants to see a shake-up. \u201cOur current model of housebuilding simply isn\u2019t delivering the affordable homes we desperately need \u2013 it allows big developers to make millions while ordinary families face colossal housing costs,\u201d said Anne Baxendale, Shelter\u2019s director of communications, policy and campaigns. \u201cThe government needs to introduce a fresh new way of building homes which brings down the huge cost of land and delivers genuinely affordable and high-quality homes that millions of families are crying out for.\u201d</p> <p>The government says it is working on the problem. \u201cWe\u2019re investing \u00a37.1bn to build more affordable homes,\u201d said a spokesman for the Department for Communities and Local Government. \u201cWe\u2019ve already helped more than 400,000 households into home ownership through government-backed schemes since 2010, and the number of first-time buyers is at a nine-year annual high.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>The outlook</strong></h2> <p>Both Halifax and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2017/aug/01/house-prices-stabilise-as-number-of-homes-on-the-market-falls\" title=\"\">Nationwide</a> say a lack of homes on the market will continue to support house prices in coming months. Rics is predicting flat prices and rents for at least the next year.</p> <p>The Rics survey of agents, covering 538 branches, found that for the next 12 months, a net balance of 28% anticipate an increase in prices. But that was the least positive reading since last July, immediately after the EU referendum.</p> <p>Countrywide\u2019s Earley sees downside risks for house prices from a Brexit-related rise in unemployment and from the Bank of England raising interest rates. On the other hand, there is an upside risk following a period of subdued activity. \u201cThe longer that we have got low transactions, the more pent-up demand we have. When confidence returns, things could pick up more quickly,\u201d said Earley. \u201cI don\u2019t expect big falls in house prices but on the other side I don\u2019t expect there to be big increases in incomes to push house prices up significantly.\u201d</p> <p>Martin Beck at consultancy Oxford Economics said there was a lack of drivers to push up house price growth but equally an absence of the kind of forces which have typically caused prices to&#xa0;fall. \u201cUK house price growth is running out of steam. And with household incomes squeezed and the affordability of housing stretched, we think a prolonged period of very modest growth lies ahead. But the prospect of a crash is remote,\u201d he said.</p>",

This is a small country with tough planning laws and a tax system that creates incentives for people to invest in bricks and mortar. Mostly, limits on supply plus strong demand equals rising prices. There is little to suggest that the property market is about to go though the agonies of the late 1980s and early 1990s, when prices fell in real terms for more than half a decade and record numbers of homes were repossessed. But the market has weakened since the start of the year and will remain weak for the foreseeable future. And that will have consequences for the wider economy. There are a number of reasons for the slowdown. The buy-to-let sector has gone cold since more a more stringent tax regime was introduced last year. Households have seen their real incomes squeezed by rising inflation and this has made them risk-averse on big financial decisions. A flat period was also inevitable in those parts of the country \u2013 primarily, but not exclusively, London \u2013 where the market was running hot in the middle years of the current decade.

The extremely difficult period in the late 80s and early 90s was caused by a doubling of interest rates from 7.5% to 15%, which in turn led unemployment to rise to more than three million. The current backdrop could hardly be more different: the unemployment rate has just fallen to its lowest level in four decades while rates are at 0.25%. Mortgage arrears are historically low. Clearly, the picture would change if higher interest rates plunged the economy into recession. That would result in higher unemployment and higher arrears, and turn house prices negative. The Bank of England is wary of tightening policy for that very reason. As Kallum Pickering of Berenberg has noted, there is a close correlation between house prices and consumer spending: a 10% year-on-year increase in house prices normally implies a 2.5% increase in spending. Conversely, falling house prices would have a negative impact on spending patterns, particularly given households\u2019 high level of debt. As the first six months of 2017 have shown, when the housing market is weak, consumer spending is weak. And when consumer spending is weak, the economy doesn\u2019t grow very fast.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The actor Danny Glover and Senator Bernie Sanders are preparing to lobby the French government for help in the heated attempt to unionize a Nissan car plant in Mississippi. The United Auto Workers suffered a historic defeat of the Nissan plant in Canton, Mississippi, this month after a long campaign marred by allegations of bribery and intimidation. Nissan and France\u2019s Renault share a deep alliance, with each company owning shares in the other and sharing a chief executive officer, Carlos Ghosn. The French government owns a close to 20% stake in Renault. Glover, most famous for roles in the Lethal Weapon series and The Color Purple, is a longtime activist and supporter of the UAW and its fight to unionize in the US south. He and Sanders intend to lobby the French president, Emmanuel Macron, to push for a second vote. \u201cHe would protect the rights of workers in France with respect to Nissan,\u201d Glover told the Guardian. \u201cHe would protect the rights for those workers, so why wouldn\u2019t he protect the rights of workers in the United States, as well as particularly in the south?\u201d Nissan operates 45 auto plants around the globe. The only ones without union representation are in the southern US. Glover has traveled multiple times with Nissan workers to meet with members of the French parliament. He says he is prepared to travel all over the world to lead a global campaign to put pressure on Nissan. The National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) filed charges against Nissan, accusing the company of bribery and intimidation during the ballot. Company managers held one-on-one meetings with workers to press for a no vote. Glover said it was time for Macron to speak up. \u201cWill he stand up and look us in the eye and tell us the truth that this was an unfair situation for workers, that this was an unfair election?\u201d said Glover. The French government has previously spoken out against corporate practices at the car firm. Last May, Macron, then France\u2019s economy minister, criticised Ghosn\u2019s \u20ac7.3m ($8.6m) pay package, blaming \u201cdysfunctional governance\u201d and calling for the company to show more restraint over pay. In 2016, one of Macron\u2019s deputies, the French labor minister, Myriam El Khomri, co-signed a letter with Tom Perez, then the Democratic US labor secretary, calling on Renault Nissan to ensure a fair election in Mississippi. But Macron has remained silent on the Nissan vote since his election. \u201cI really haven\u2019t seen France do anything on this campaign, and this is their factory,\u201d said the Nissan workers union activist Morris Mock. After a recent visit to Canton, Mississippi, the Renault union leader Fabien Gauche, of the labor federation CGT, told Ouest France: \u201cThere are pressures and intimidation efforts that we can\u2019t imagine in France.\u201d Gauche said that he had raised the allegations with Nissan, but they have ignored them. \u201cThere is a complete denial of the situation,\u201d Gauche told Ouest France. \u201cThey respond to us saying the accounts we\u2019re hearing from workers are false ... For management, everything\u2019s happening in the best of all worlds.\u201d French members of parliament are now beginning to raise questions and are calling on Renault Nissan to hold a new election. \u201cWe solemnly call on the president of the Republic, Emmanuel Macron, to show the value of France\u2019s attachment to union rights and freedoms, here and everywhere else across the world, to demand Carlos Ghosn respect union rights and allow for elections to take place in a climate of neutrality,\u201d wrote the French national assembly member Christian Hutin in a joint op-ed with the European parliament member Virginie Roziere in the daily Liberation.",

      "bodyText": "James Willing from London was looking forward to a restful long weekend in Toulouse with his partner, but it turned out to be anything but, after what he describes as \u201cappalling\u201d treatment by easyJet. The budget airline overbooked the flight and denied him boarding at the gate \u2013 even though he had checked in on time. He claims he was sworn at by ground staff at Gatwick airport and was forced to spend three hours being shuffled through non-EU immigration controls. Adding insult to injury, easyJet then denied responsibility and refused to pay a penny of compensation. Willing\u2019s ordeal came just days after reports that the airline removed an unaccompanied child from an overbooked flight and left him alone at the departure gate \u2013 on precisely the same Gatwick-Toulouse route. It also comes amid a rising number of complaints about overbooking, luggage and failure to pay compensation concerning easyJet that are turning up in Money\u2019s Consumer Champions postbag. Unlike Ryanair, easyJet routinely overbooks its flights in a bid to maximise profits. And while the airline used to pay volunteers to get off in the event everyone turned up, Willing\u2019s experience suggests that its policy may be to remove whoever checked in last. \u201cI had checked in online well within the permitted time frame, and been given a seat number. But when I came to print my boarding card a little later, it had disappeared and no seat number showed up \u2013 I was simply told to go to the gate,\u201d he says. When he arrived and asked what was going on, he says he was astounded to be told that the flight was full, and that while his partner with whom he was travelling could get on, he could not. After a row, which involved supervisors and ground crew, he was forced to spend three hours going back through the airport supervised by the ground crew. \u201cThey wouldn\u2019t let me use the automated passport booths but insisted I had to go through immigration control for international (non-EU) arrivals, which meant two hours in a queue to show my passport,\u201d he adds. Once back in the departure hall, he says easyJet staff were not remotely interested in helping him. They also told him that there were no seats available on the easyJet flight to Toulouse that night. However, he was able to book via a travel agent at the airport \u2026 onto that very flight. This cost \u00a3200 \u2013 \u00a380 more than his original booking. \u201cThe story gets worse. When I arrived at the gate, there was another passenger, an elderly French woman, in floods of tears because they had done exactly the same thing to her \u2013 bumped her off the flight \u2013 and she was going to miss a funeral as a result.\u201d When Willing returned home and applied for the compensation he was due under the EU 261 rules, plus a refund of the extra flight and other expenses, he was astonished to be told by easyJet that it had no record of him being taken off the original flight, and as result it would not be paying him anything. Only an email to easyJet\u2019s outgoing chief executive, Carolyn McCall, finally prompted some action. It has now agreed to refund the flight and give him the compensation he is due for being denied boarding. \u201cTo me the overbooking thing is just greed \u2013 it\u2019s prioritising profits over the welfare of passengers. There is no need to do it \u2013 why should paying passengers have their holidays ruined in this way. It\u2019s an appalling way to treat your customers. I am still angry about it now,\u201d he says. An easyJet spokeswoman apologised to Willing for his experience. \u201cWe are very sorry that he has not already been compensated in line with EU 261. We always aim to provide compensation as quickly as possible and customers can claim their expenses and EU 261 online, typically now receiving their money in their account five days later.\u201d EasyJet added that it was \u201ccompletely open\u201d about its overbooking procedures. \u201cWe sometimes sell more seats on a flight if we know that there is a high likelihood of passengers not turning up. We look at the historical data for each flight to determine the number of no-shows we\u2019ve seen in the past and use this to calculate the number we can expect in the future. \u201cWe will always ask for volunteers to give up their seats in the first instance, and only a tiny proportion of our passengers are unable to take a flight due to oversales. On average, across our flights, we will only overbook by one or two per flight and, as a result, it is rare for easyJet to deny boarding because a flight is overbooked.\u201d Its statement suggests that if you are checking in online and receive a message that says \u201conline check-in is unavailable ... go to the bag drop desks\u201d then it is time to get worried. \u201cWe do this because it reduces unnecessary concern about being overbooked as 97% of those who are overbooked will fly as planned. We allocate seats in order of check-in and our check-in opens 30 days prior to departure.\u201d In 2015, Money featured the case of Gary Walton, whose five-day golfing break in Spain was wrecked when he and a friend were bumped off their easyJet flight. They had checked in online a week earlier, and had their boarding passes and seats allocated, but when they tried to check in their luggage at Luton \u2013 more than two hours before takeoff \u2013 they were told the flight had been overbooked. EasyJet paid statutory compensation after they were forced to abandon their trip, but they lost the cost of the hotel, hire car and transfer. \u201cI thought I was buying a flight, not a lottery ticket,\u201d said Walton at the time.",
