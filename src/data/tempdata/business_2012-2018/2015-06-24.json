      "bodyText": "A quick update: tonight\u2019s talks started a little late. But Tsipras has now arrived: Another update: And later, they left, ready for another dramatic day on Thursday.... Those top-level negotiations should be starting again anytime now, in the hope of making progress by morning.... And here\u2019s confirmation that the eurogroup will convene again at 1pm local time on Thursday. Oh, I can\u2019t resist a couple more photos -- here\u2019s Greece\u2019s finance minister Yanis Varoufakis and chief economics spokesman Euclid Tsakalotos departing tonight\u2019s unusually short eurogroup meeting.... And here\u2019s Christine Lagarde too: I\u2019m going to take a break now -- as Thursday is going to be extremely busy. So here\u2019s Ian Traynor\u2019s full report on events from another dramatic day: I\u2019ll try to pop back in if there are major developments in Brussels overnight, from the talks between Greece and her creditors: Otherwise, see you again in the morning.... GW Alexis Tsipras now has just 90 minutes grace, before another tussle with the IMF, ECB and EC at 10pm BST (midnight if you\u2019re reading in Athens). So to quickly recap.... Eurozone finance ministers have decided there\u2019s no point talking late into the night about Greece, as an agreement is still some distance away. Tonight\u2019s meeting in Brussels quickly showed that there are still fundamental differences between Athens and its creditors over its bailout reform programme, with less than a week until it expires. A meeting that was meant to go into the night and actually deliver a deal actually ended after barely an hour, once ministers had been briefed. The Eurogroup swiftly concluded that it isn\u2019t in any position to draw up the staff-level agreement needed to unlock aid for Greece. Instead, they will meet again at 1pm CEST in Brussels on Thursday, for another crack at it: Alex Stubb, Finland\u2019s finance minister, is telling reporters outside the building that the work will continue, but time is running out. Top-level talks will continue tonight - with the two sides still divided over what reforms Greece should implement. At 11pm Brussels time (10pm BST) the Greek PM will meet the leaders of Greece\u2019s creditors again in another attempt to crank out an agreement by the morning.... So what\u2019s the situation? Athens is refusing to accept the pension reforms demanded by the IMF, including raising the effective retirement age faster and phasing out the \u201csolidarity grant\u201d paid to the poorest pensioners. The IMF, though, is insistent that Greece\u2019s proposal needs to be reworked, putting less of a burden on businesses and accelerating the reform process. In short, it wants more spending cuts and less tax rises, and simply doesn\u2019t believe Greece\u2019s maths. As my colleague Larry Elliott puts it: In the unlikely event that the extra revenues were collected in full, the IMF believes the one-off levy on bigger businesses coupled with the increases in corporation tax would hinder growth. It thinks the Greek plan will only add up if there are immediate cuts in pensions and higher VAT on restaurants and medical supplies. Today\u2019s leaked documents showed that creditors have taken a red pen to Tsipras\u2019s precious red lines. Are we closer to a deal? Bloomberg economist Maximu Sbaihi fears we\u2019re further away! Leaving the meeting, Eurogroup president Jeroen Dijsselbleom tells reporters that ministers are \u201cdetermined to continue work during the night if necessary,\u201d. We had feared that ministers wouldn\u2019t emerge until dawn tomorrow, but actually they\u2019re hitting the road before the sun sets. NEWSFLASH: The eurogroup has broken up without a deal, according to Finland\u2019s finance minister. And talks are going to restart at noon BST tomorrow. There are dramatic scenes too, as the French delegation sprint through the room. The Greek government has just released a statement slamming the new proposal tabled by creditors. They say: The Greek government delegation came to today\u2019s negotiation based on the text of the proposal which institutions had accepted as a base of discussion on Monday. The institutions, for their part, tabled a new proposal which transfers the burden [of austerity] to wage earners and pensioners in a way which is socially unfair while at the same time suggesting measures to avoid the increase of burden on those who have (to give).\u201d The Greek side cannot agree with such a [change of] direction. Negotiations are continuing at all levels.\u201d Veteran political commentator Alexis Papachelas predicated that the tough bargaining could continue all the way through to Tuesday when Athens must meet a debt repayment of \u20ac1.6bn euro to the IMF. \u201cI don\u2019t think anything will happen tonight. There is a very negative climate ... we should not be surprised by anything, this tough bargaining could continue all the way through to 11:45 on Tuesday,\u201d he told Skai TV\u2019s flagship news program. \u201cWhat worries me is not so much the drachma lobby in Greece but the drachma lobby that appears to be developing abroad.\u201d If in doubt.... OK, there\u2019s now talk that Alexis Tsipras and Jean-Claude Juncker will meet again at 11pm Brussels time tonight for another session. Eleni Varvitsiotis of Greek newspaper Kathimerini has also heard that the eurogroup meeting may be suspended. Finance ministers, it appears, aren\u2019t best pleased to be meeting *again* without a deal to sign off. Today\u2019s meeting between the Greek PM and the heads of the IMF, ECB and EU sounds like a gruelling affair: Rumours are swirling that Alexis Tsipras, the Greek PM, will hold another meeting with Jean-Claude Junker tonight, once the Eurogroup has ended. In which case..... there may not be much point in the finance ministers talking until dawn. And indeed, Suzanne Lynch of the Irish Times has heard that ministers might break (at some point) and meet again in the morning... Picture of the day? Bloomberg has also flagged up that rumour that another emergency eurozone summit might be needed on Friday.... With no breakthrough between Tsipras, Lagarde, Draghi and Juncker earlier, it\u2019s hard to see how the finance ministers can really get anything done tonight. Rumours were swirling earlier that this could mean the meeting is quite short -- and that another emergency meeting called on Friday. That would mean the issue is bumped back up to the EU leaders at their summit tomorrow night. No decision on that yet, though. The ministers are all assembled, and ready to hear the state of play regarding Greece\u2019s bailout programme following today\u2019s intense talks between Alexis Tsipras and the creditors. Here\u2019s some photos from inside the room: Is there any cause for optimism? Well, it\u2019s not raining.... Germany\u2019s finance minister, Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble, has also joined the chorus of ministers saying a deal is unlikely tonight.... Hans J\u00f6rg Schelling, Austria\u2019s finance minister, also plays down hopes of a deal tonight. Still lots of work to do, he says. Alex Stubb of Finland has arrived, and says: I would be very positively surprised if there was a deal tonight. There has been a lot of back of forth between the technical level and the political level, and we haven\u2019t seen a concrete proposal yet, and we have to deal with it very carefully based on our parliamentary mandates.... We don\u2019t take these issues lightly, he adds. Her\u2019s a clip of Pierre Moscovici, telling reporters that the fight to reach a deal continues: Vladis Dombrovskis, European Commissioner for the euro, does speak to the press. He says that \u201cWe are in a process of very intensive negotiations\u201d. Progress is being made, but we\u2019re not there yet. Will it be a late night? Dombrovskis: It is likely that we are going to have a long night, but I cannot add any more at this stage. They\u2019re closely followed by Pierre Moscovici, who tells the media (in French) that a deal is both \u2018necessary and possible\u2019. Here comes Christine Lagarde....and the IMF chief just waves to the media and walks in. Yanis Varoufakis has also just arrived, but the Greek finance minister also declines to speak to the press. You can always rely on Slovakia\u2019s finance minister, Peter Kazimir, for a decent quote or two. Three eurogroup meetings and two summits should be enough to reach a solution for Greece, he says pointedly ( he\u2019s even clutching a book in case things get boring). I\u2019m curious to know what the eurozone will look like when this meeting is over, Kazimir adds - a hint that Greece might be closer to the exit door? Ahha - Mario Draghi has slipped into the meeting, fresh from his talks with Alexis Tsipras. #awkward.... Belgium\u2019s Johan Van Overtveldt then insists that the eurogroup must put the needs of the Greek people first. We have a very big responsibility towards the Greek population, I think their suffering is immense. Can you imagine an economy that diminishes by 25% in a few years? That\u2019s horrendous. We have to stop that...We have a moral obligation here. But surely the pension cuts and tax rises being pushed by the Institutions will make this worse? Van Overtveldt argues that it\u2019s wrong to say that Greece\u2019s bailout programme has been very bad for the country; the problem is that it\u2019s never been properly implemented. Belgian finance minister Johan Van Overtveldt does speak to the press (good man!). Can we still reach a deal? First we must see what the institutions bring to the table. They have been negotiating very hard for the last 48 hours... Is it time for give Greece a \u2018take-it-or-leave-it\u201d ultimatum? Overtveldt: I don\u2019t like these kind of deadlines. We need to reach a good deal for the Greek economy....that\u2019s important for every Greek citizen. We also need a deal that is good for monetary union. So if we can\u2019t reach a deal today, we\u2019ll see if we can get somewhere tomorrow, Overtveldt adds. Well, that worked! Michel Sapin, France\u2019s finance minister, just arrived. Don\u2019t think he said anything to the press though. There is also no sign of eurozone finance ministers arriving for tonight\u2019s crunch meeting: The Euro Working Group, which does the prep work for the Eurogroup, has ended its own meeting a few minutes ago - but otherwise, the wait continues. Still no signs of a breakthrough in today\u2019s top-level talks. There\u2019s a certain amount of healthy competition among journalists in Brussels as they scramble for a desk to work at tonight. Politico\u2019s own liveblog has the details: OVERBOOKED:While we\u2019re all waiting for the Eurogroup ministers to arrive for their doorstop interviews at the Lex building, the Brussels press corps was waiting too \u2026 to be let into the building. \u201cPeople weren\u2019t showing their best side,\u201d according to Zeke Turner (@zekeft), \u201cclambering for the limited number of workplaces provided by the Council.\u201d Perhaps seats could be assigned according to each media outlet\u2019s web traffic? ;) Finland\u2019s finance minister (and social media natural) Alexander Stubb has arrived in Brussels, and headed off for talks with fellow centre-right politicians. Another sign that the eurogroup meeting will start late. Back in Brussels, a Greek official has just warned that tonight\u2019s eurogroup meeting might start late, as talks between prime minister Alexis Tsipras and its lenders continue.... It was due to begin at 7pm local time, or in just under an hour\u2019s time. Most European stock markets ended the day in the red, as traders fretted about Greece\u2019s bailout talks. The Athens market fared badly; bank shares dropped up 10%, pulling the main ATG index down 1.8%. But it\u2019s not a full-blown rout: Joshua Mahony of IG says the City is \u201cthoroughly confused\u201d by the Greek situation. Many investors expect a deal eventually, but also foresee more drama ahead. Unfortunately, beyond this month\u2019s \u20ac1.6bn repayment due to the IMF, the \u20ac7.2bn currently on the line will not cover both July and August\u2019s ECB payments. Thus unless we see an extension to the current bailout programme, we could see both sides back to the negotiation table this time next month. Eurozone finance ministers should be arriving in Brussels soonish, for tonight\u2019s Eurogroup meeting. There\u2019s a live video feed here -- currently showing an empty driveway and a few trees swaying gently in the late afternoon. Quite soothing really. Today\u2019s flurry of proposals, counter-proposals, leaks and verbal attacks are all terribly dramatic, but they may not mean negotiations will definitely fail. As a senior official from one of the creditors put it to Reuters: \u201cOf course we want changes and they don\u2019t, and this is part of the bargaining process, albeit less effective when done publicly.\u201d A Syriza government official has slammed the latest proposals from creditors as \u2018absurd\u2019, at a meeting of the coalition\u2019s political committee. The pints of red ink spilled over the proposals submitted by Greece\u2019s (democratically elected) government are a clear sign of how IMF bailouts really work, tweets economics professor Daniela Gabor. It\u2019s all gone eerily quiet in Brussels, so let\u2019s quickly recap: Alexis Tsipras is locked in talks with Greece\u2019s creditors that could help determine whether Athens receives the bailout funds it needs to avoid bankruptcy. Insiders say that the outcome of today\u2019s negotiations with Christine Lagarde, Mario Draghi and Jean-Claude Juncker is highly uncertain, with no guarantee of a breakthrough. Hopes of a deal tonight were badly dented this morning, after it emerged that Greece\u2019s latest proposals have not been accepted by its creditors, putting the whole deal in doubt Instead, the IMF is pushing Athens to make deeper cuts to pension spending, raise more from VAT, and also row back on its corporation tax hikes. See the five-page counter-proposal here. Tsipras has blasted the creditors as he headed to Brussels, suggesting they were trying to back \u2018special interests\u2019. This dramatic collapse in relations comes as eurozone finance ministers head to Brussels for their third Eurogroup meeting in six days. They should be arriving soon, and the talks could last late into the night. In short, the long Greek crisis is heading to the wire. If the eurogroup cannot reach a deal, then EU leaders will be unable to rubber-stamp it at Thursday\u2019s EU summit. That means Greece won\u2019t be in a position to pass measures and access bailout funds before the whole package expires on 30 June, which means it almost certainly can\u2019t avoid defaulting on the IMF that day. Analysts fear that Tsipras will find it very hard to get political support for a bailout deal, especially if he is forced into fresh concessions today. And anger is rising in Athens, which has seen protests in recent days. One government insider told us: \u201cIt is as if they don\u2019t want to reach a deal with a government of the left.... \u201cWhat the hell are they doing insisting that the vulnerable carry the weight of measures once again? It hasn\u2019t worked before and it is not going to work now.\u201d Greece\u2019s opposition centrist party, To Potami, has announced that the country should cut \u2018excessive\u2019 spending rather than hiking taxes. Their leader, Stavros Theodorakis, met with commissioner Pierre Moscovici in Brussels today. And speaking afterwards, Theodorakis\u2019 message chimed rather more closely with Greece\u2019s creditors than with Alexis Tsipras\u2019s position today. Theodorakis said his party would back a deal, but also wants to add more pro-growth measures: \u201cThis was a meeting in a very crucial moment, a very difficult day. Mr Moscovici reiterated the need to reach a deal today. He unequivocally insisted on this need. He said that he wants and that there should be a deal for Greece today. He asked us whether there will be a European majority in the country. I reassured him that Potami has committed itself to support a deal, and I also told him that, I think, that the majority of the Hellenic Parliament will support a deal signed by the government and our European partners. He also wanted to know the stance of the Greek society. I told him that what the Greek society really wants right now is for this torture to come to an end and the beginning of an era, without the of uncertainty that we experience today. Our Europe Editor, Ian Traynor, sees days of frenzied negotiations and activity ahead: Hopes of an early deal have been further dashed by the sight of the leaked counted-proposals from Greece\u2019s creditors: I\u2019ve not seen so much red ink and crossings-out since my last college essay: The five-page counter-proposal made by Greece\u2019s creditors has just leaked - in several places. And it confirms that Athens has been pushed to raise more from VAT and also make sweeping changes to its pensions system, including raising the retirement age faster and eliminating benefits for the poorest pensioners. The red crossings out show items which are being rejected by creditors, and the underlined red sections show the new proposals. The pensions section is a wholesale rewrite: Swallowing all this will be very hard for the Greek PM, let alone his party. You can see all five pages here on Skai.GR. Bad news: There still isn\u2019t a deal. Good news: they\u2019re still talking...... 15:07:07 - OUTCOME OF TALKS BETWEEN GREECE AND CREDITORS IN BRUSSELS STILL VERY UNCERTAIN, NO DEAL YET - OFFICIAL CLOSE TO CREDITOR Even if a deal is reached tonight in Brussels (or on Thursday morning), Alexis Tsipras will face a real fight to get it through the Athens parliament. And German MPs will also be asked to vote, possibly at an emergency session. Nina Schick of Open Europe, the think tank, explains: If Greece and the creditors agree something by tomorrow (still not a given), the immediate challenge for Tsipras will be at home, where he\u2019ll have to get the Greek parliament to back it. Despite Syriza\u2019s election promises, what\u2019s on the table now means that Tsipras has more or less capitulated completely to the demands of the creditors. It\u2019s not likely to go down well. With a majority of only 11 MPs, Tsipras will seek approval from the 200 MPs that form the Central Committee of Syriza. According to Greek press reports, 10-40 Syriza MPs are likely to revolt. Syriza\u2019s junior coalition partner, the Independent Greeks, have also indicated that they could withdraw from the government. Tsipras could be left having to rely on the support of the opposition New Democracy. This in turn would open up the question of a referendum or new elections. Vassilis Primikiris, a senior member of Syriza\u2019s hard-line Left Platform told Italy\u2019s La Repubblica today: \u201cI doubt [Tsipras] can afford to pass the deal [in the Greek parliament] without our votes and with the opposition\u2019s votes. That would mean there\u2019s no longer a majority and that we should go to elections.\u201d -Vassilis Primikiris, La Repubblica, 24 June 2015 As Greece\u2019s largest creditor nation, the vote in the German Bundestag will also be key. With the Bundestag breaking for summer recess next Friday July 3rd, the vote will either have to be taken on the 29th or 30th of June \u2013 not allowing German MPs much time to consider the measures. A Bild report today suggests that a number of MPs from Angela Merkel\u2019s CDU/CSU party are opposed a rushed vote on any new agreement with Greece. CDU MP Olav Gutting is quoted as saying, \u201cI don\u2019t consider it possible to approve anything on Monday or Tuesday.\u201d There is a possibility, then, that an emergency sitting of the Bundestag may have to be called. And while any deal backed by Chancellor Angela Merkel is likely to get through the Bundestag \u2013 it\u2019s worth noting that with frustration towards Athens climaxing during the past five months, the breakdown in trust will surely come back to haunt Athens sooner or later \u2013 most likely when the discussion returns to an (inevitable) third bailout for Greece. More here: If you\u2019re just joining us, check out my colleague Jennifer Rankin\u2019s latest news story on the crisis: Marcus Walker of the Wall Street Journal sums up the situation in the negotiating room in Brussels. (DSA= debt sustainability analysis. IE: If Greece ramps up taxes, growth will slow and the debt/GDP ratio will spiral even more) The Curse of the Awards Ceremony: We\u2019re keeping track of the state of play in Greece\u2019s debt negotiations here: Speaking of the IMF, Politico have published a great feature today on how it became entangled in such a mess in Greece. It explains how Christine Lagarde is left with a mess created by her predecessor, Dominique Strauss-Kahn, as she struggles to ensure the Fund gets its money back. Here\u2019s a flavour: Because Greece was in a monetary union, and couldn\u2019t devalue its currency, the IMF introduced a \u201csystemic exemption\u201d that waived any condition related to debt, says Jean-Pierre Landau, who was then a deputy governor of the French central bank and now teaches at Sciences Po in Paris. That was \u201ca code word for the risk of contagion inside the euro area,\u201d he notes. The IMF board, right from the beginning, found it hard to accept and \u201cit created resentment and a lot of skepticism\u201d within the institution, adds Landau, who knows the IMF well, having been its French board member in the early nineties. The Greek bailout also created a precedent in terms of size. It was the largest ever implemented by the IMF, as a percentage of a given country\u2019s stake in the Fund. Between the first and second bailout in 2012, the IMF ended up loaning about \u20ac30 billion to Greece. Some \u20ac23 billion is still owed, to be paid back until the end of 2030, starting with \u20ac5.5 billion due by the end of this year. Then there were the forecasting mistakes. Sterne notes for example that the IMF revised down its estimate for Greece\u2019s 2014 gross domestic product by some 22 percent in the space of 18 months. \u201cIn U.S. terms, that is the equivalent of revising away the combined output of the whole of California, New York and Florida,\u201d he writes. Why the IMF\u2019s so hard on Greece A senior German official has told Reuters that any aid-for-reforms deal with Greece must include the support of the International Monetary Fund: The official said that it was important for Berlin to have the IMF at the table, both for its expertise and its role in financing Greece. Of course, the IMF\u2019s \u201cexpertise\u201d means it believes Greece needs debt relief - an issue Germany isn\u2019t terribly happy about confronting at this stage. The Athens stock market was deep in the red as Alexis Tsipras\u2019s meeting with creditors began - down around 4.5%. Bank shares are down 10%. Greece\u2019s Esfyn newspaper has confirmed that the IMF presented Greece with new counter-proposals. And they do indeed insisting on tougher pension and VAT reforms -- to yield a full 1% of GDP, and a smaller rise in corporation tax. The IMF also wants early retirement rules to be tightened up faster, and ending lower VAT rates in Greek islands (a red line for Tsipras\u2019s coalition partners, ANEL). Greece and its creditors are still deeply divided over three key areas -- corporate taxation, the overhaul of Greece\u2019s pension system and value-added taxes. That\u2019s according to the latest counter-proposal from the Institutions, which the Wall Street Journal has seen. And which Greece has rejected. According to the WSJ, Greece\u2019s creditors won\u2019t accept some of the tax rises on businesses, which they want toned down. But they also want more money clawed from consumers through VAT hikes. And Greece\u2019s plan to raise pension contributions while protecting payments to existing pensioners is also being challenged. Creditors want more frontline cuts. Divisions Remain as Eurozone Finance Ministers Meet Over Greece Deal Finally, here\u2019s some footage of Alexis Tsipras arriving at the Commission. He resisted saying anything to the media, beyond a polite \u201cHi\u201d. And then he vanished to meet Greece\u2019s creditors, for some very serious talks. Oh sorry, the photo in that last tweet isn\u2019t from today (now deleted). Looks like Commissioner Pierre Moscovici took out his frustrations on a biscuit at this lunchtime\u2019s crisis meeting: Oh sorry, they\u2019ve turned off the video feed from the EC. Apparently Alexis Tsipras has arrived, but didn\u2019t speak to the press. Alexis Tsipras is arriving at the European Commission to meet president Jean-Claude Juncker imminently. It will be streamed live here. Two days ago, Tsipras got a jokey slap from Juncker, so I shudder to think how he\u2019ll be greeted this time.... Sky\u2019s Ed Conway is hearing that all isn\u2019t lost between Greece and its lenders..... Fascinated by the latest twists and turns in the Greek crisis? Well, come along to the Guardian\u2019s panel discussion in London tomorrow night...and have your say too: The midday briefing in Brussels didn\u2019t yield much information on the escalating Greek crisis. After a fascinating discussion about senior management changes at the European Commission, the Brussels press pack were only told that: The [Greek] proposals are a step in the direction to finding common ground for an agreement, and they are being discussed as we speak....at the highest level. The leaders of Greece\u2019s creditors are sitting down in Brussels now to discuss the situation. They must digest Alexis Tsipras\u2019s dramatic attack on the IMF this morning, before the Greek PM joins them. There are some very serious-looking faces around the table: EU officials are briefing that talks with Greece have not broken down -- which I guess is meant to sound reassuring. Reuters has the story: Talks with Greece on a financing for reforms package are still going on and a meeting between international creditors and Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras in Brussels will take place as planned, an EU official said on Wednesday. Markets reacted nervously to a statement out of Athens by a Greek government official quoting Tsipras as saying that creditors have rejected certain proposals from Greece in last-ditch talks in Brussels. An EU official close to the talks said. \u201cNothing has broken down, negotiations are going on and the meeting with Tsipras will go ahead as planned.\u201d And here\u2019s those nervous markets: Jeroen Dijsselbloem, president of the Eurogroup of finance ministers, has confirmed that a Greek deal still hangs in the balance ahead of tonight\u2019s meeting. EUROGROUP HEAD DIJSSELBLOEM ON GREECE TALKS SAYS \u201cWE ARE NOT THERE YET, STILL A LOT OF WORK TO BE DONE\u201d Alexis Tsipras has also tweeted his criticism of the International Monetary Fund, meaning the gloves are well and truly off. (That\u2019s Poul Thomsen, the IMF\u2019s top man in Europe) And the \u201cequivalent measures\u201d are the new policies that Greece has proposed, to change its old bailout programme. In short, Greece is unhappy that the IMF won\u2019t support its plan to raise \u20ac8bn from taxes on businesses, shoppers, income tax payers and pensioners. My colleague Helena Smith has got hold of the statement just released by the Greek government. And it shows that prime minister Alexis Tsipras says the refusal of creditors to accept Athens\u2019 latest proposals is not only unprecedented but has \u201cnever happened either in Italy, Portugal. Nowhere!\u201d Before departing for Brussels, Alexis Tsipras told his colleagues: \u201cThis strange stance may hide two possibilities. Either they don\u2019t want an agreement or they are serving specific interests in Greece.\u201d This would chime with what insiders told us earlier: that inside the governing far left Syriza party there are now many who are openly questioning whether the EU, ECB and IMF really want to cut a deal with the Tsipras administration. The German, French, Spanish and Italian stock markets all tumbled by 1% as investors reacted to the news that Greek negotiations are faltering: It\u2019s not looking good at all. According to FT Brussels bureau chief Peter Spiegel, Greece\u2019s creditors are unhappy that Athens is backtracking on parts of the deal submitted early on Monday. Prior actions are the measures that Greece must take before it receives any bailout funds. The wheels may be coming off..... The Greek government has just criticised the country\u2019s lenders for not accepting its latest proposals. And that has knocked shares across Europe, sending the Athens market down over 4%. Eurozone government bonds are being hit too, driving up the yields (or interest rates) on Spanish and Italian debt. Over in Athens the political opposition has stepped up criticism of the government\u2019s proposed reforms, and are also heading to Brussels to rally for a deal: Helena Smith reports: It is not only Alexis Tsipras who is making his way from Athens to Brussels today. Former prime minister Antonis Samaras and Stavros Theodorakis, leader of the centrist To Potami party, are both also departing for the Belgian capital today ahead of tomorrow\u2019s EU summit. Both say they want to make the case for Greece. Samaras, whose conservative-led government was ousted by Tsipras\u2019 Syriza in January - is aiming to have a quiet word with German chancellor Merkel on the sidelines of the summit. At \u20ac8bn \u2013 eight times more than savings outlined by his conservative government in December \u2013 Samaras says Greece has been forced to choose \u201cbetween catastrophe and a very bad solution.\u201d Five months of drawn out negotiations and putting up a robust defence had been a fiasco, Samaras\u2019s centre-right New Democracy party said. Criticism of prime minister Alexis Tsipras\u2019 finance minister Yanis Varoufakis is on the rise with Yannis Vroutsis, the former minister of labour, accusing the academic-turned politician of \u201cgetting a certificate in inaccuracy and lies.\u201d \u201cIf there any Greek who now believes Mr Varoufakis?\u201d he asked this morning. Varoufakis, though, was quite upbeat this morning, telling reporters that: \u201cWe are entering the final stage of the negotiation which we hope, we strive, to be the last.\u201d And here\u2019s confirmation that eurozone finance ministers could work all night to get a deal: 10:32:01 - EU LEADERS WON\u2019T NEGOTIATE ON GREECE AT SUMMIT ON THURSDAY, WANT DEAL AT EUROGROUP ON WED EVEN IF IT MEANS WORK THROUGH THE NIGHT - SENIOR EU OFFICIAL Here\u2019s further confirmation that Greece\u2019s bailout deal remains up in the air, from Reuters: 10:14:30 - POSITIONS OF CREDITORS AND GREECE STILL APART BEFORE EU/IMF/ECB MEETING WITH TSIPRAS TODAY, NOT MUCH PROGRESS MADE ON TUESDAY - EU OFFICIAL 10:16:14 - VAT, PENSIONS, COMPANY TAXATION MAIN STICKING POINTS WITH GREECE AT THIS STAGE, DEBT RESTRUCTURING NOT DISCUSSED - EU OFFICIAL The head of the Eurogroup has been told in no uncertain terms that finance ministers must agree a deal with Greece today, Brussels insiders say. However long it takes. Alexis Tsipras\u2019s trip to Brussels today is a \u201clast ditch\u201d bid to salvage his bailout agreement, says the Financial Times. Echoing Ian Traynor\u2019s warning that the deal could soon unravel, the FT says the Greek PM will be pushed to revise his reform plan at the meeting with Lagarde, Draghi and Juncker. From Brussels, the FT\u2019s Peter Spiegel writes: According to a senior eurozone official, talks between Athens and negotiators from the bailout monitors \u2014 the International Monetary Fund, European Commission, and European Central Bank \u2014 have barely progressed since Mr Tsipras\u2019 proposal was met with an outpouring of relief at a summit of eurozone leaders on Monday night. That has raised concerns over whether a deal can be finalised this evening at a meeting of eurozone finance ministers in Brussels. And crucially, Greece\u2019s creditors aren\u2019t on the same page. Two officials involved in the talks said the IMF and the commission are at loggerheads over how many revisions are required, with the IMF concerned the proposal relies almost exclusively on increased employee contributions \u2014 essentially a new 3.9 per cent tax on labour \u2014 to make up shortfalls in the pension system. The IMF has pushed for benefit cuts in the system to make it more sustainable in the long term. EU officials have termed the Greek public pension system one of the most generous in the 28-country bloc. More here: Tsipras flies to Brussels to salvage bailout deal And if that wasn\u2019t bad enough, negotiations over the issue of debt relief aren\u2019t getting anywhere. Tsipras needs to be able to present some progress on that issue to keep his MPs onside, but creditors won\u2019t budge until the current bailout programme is resolved. This is not the best day for the president of the ECB to be cooling his heels on the Heathrow tarmac: Brussels insiders are warning that today\u2019s meeting of finance ministers could last until dawn.... Over in Athens, the view this morning is that a deal with creditors has never been \u201cso near or so far away,\u201d Our correspondent Helena Smith reports: Senior government officials are saying openly this morning that divergence rather than convergence is now dominating talks. Outstanding differences are such that insiders have begun to question whether creditors want an agreement at all. The International Monetary Fund\u2019s apparent insistence that proposed taxes on businesses be withdrawn, putting a greater burden on wage earners and pensioners, has ignited fury. \u201cIt is as if they don\u2019t want to reach a deal with a government of the left,\u201d said one well-placed source. \u201cWhat the hell are they doing insisting that the vulnerable carry the weight of measures once again? It hasn\u2019t worked before and it is not going to work now.\u201d The front page headline of the Ta Nea newspaper today is indicative of the mood. \u201cThey are demanding another \u20ac700m to close the deal,\u201d the authoritative daily screamed from its front page. Prime minister Alexis Tsipras has not been helped by the signs of mounting dissent within his own Syriza party over his leftist-led government\u2019s proposed reforms. At least ten MPS have indicated they will not support a deal as the proposals currently stand; at least ten more are wavering and it remains unclear what hardliners, gathered under the Left Platform faction led by energy minister Panagiotis Lafazanis will do. The minister, so far, has been uncharacteristically coy about what stance he - or his followers - will take saying he will only decide once a final deal is on the table. Those who advocate a return to the drachma have, if anything, been emboldened by the growing outcry over measures that at \u20ac8bn will do a great deal to further impoverish Greeks. \u201cApproval of the agreement or elections, the dilemma of the government,\u201d declared another daily, Ethnos, from its front page. \u201cThe ball is now with Syriza MPs.\u201d The small right-wing Independent Greeks party (ANEL) has added to mounting concerns (some are beginning to call it realisation) that the cash-for-reform deal in its current form will not get through parliament with MPS insisting that \u201cred lines\u201d are more important than inflicting needless pain on Greeks. The only way out of the conundrum would perhaps be some kind of commitment by creditors to write down Greece\u2019s debt load in the future. More than ever, it is clear that Tsipras needs to be cut some leeway by creditors so that he can convince wavering MPs that the deal is workable and has to be passed. So, this lunchtime\u2019s meeting is absolutely crucial.... Assuming Mario Draghi\u2019s flight isn\u2019t badly delayed, he\u2019s expected at the Justus Lipsius building in Brussels at 11am BST (1pm Athens time). Tsipras arrives an hour later, to face his creditors\u2019 concerns over the Greek bailout plan. Our spies at Heathrow report that Mario Draghi might be late landing in Brussels: The Greek stock market has fallen almost 2.5% at the start of trading, ahead of today\u2019s emergency talks between prime minister Alexis Tsipras and creditors. Bank shares (which soared on Monday and Tuesday this week), fell by almost 5%, as traders begin to fret that a breakthrough deal may not come tonight. Tsipras\u2019s emergency meeting with IMF chief Christine Lagarde and ECB chief Mario Draghi is a sign that the deal could yet unravel, as my colleague Ian Traynor reported from Brussels overnight: Greece\u2019s prime minister, Alexis Tsipras, arrives in Brussels on Wednesday for critical talks with the country\u2019s creditors as the outlines of the latest proposed deal to avoid bankruptcy threatens to unravel, worsening the crisis..... The other European markets are fairly flat, as investors await developments.... Here\u2019s our analysis of the latest Greek proposal: Wonkblog\u2019s Matt O\u2019Brien has taken a nailgun to Greece\u2019s proposed reforms, and blasted the creditors for forcing Athens to cave in and propose new tax rises to satisfy their taste for budget surpluses. He writes: There\u2019s only one reason to make Greece do more austerity, and it makes no sense at all. That\u2019s to try to make it pay back what it owes. Indeed, one European official said that the entire point of this was that they \u201cwant to get our money back some day.\u201d The problem, though, is everybody knows Greece will never do that. Its debt should have been written down in 2010, but it wasn\u2019t because it was \u201cbailed out\u201d to the extent that it was given money to then give to French and German banks. The longer Europe pretends this new debt will be paid back, the longer Greece\u2019s depression will go on. Now, it\u2019s true that Europe has lowered the interest rates and extended the maturities on Greece\u2019s debt so far out that, for now at least, it\u2019s like a lot of it doesn\u2019t exist. But eventually it will, and at that point they\u2019ll either need to extend-and-pretend some more or hope that Greece has returned to growth. Until then, Greece will be stuck in its economic Groundhog Day. It keeps trying to resist these pointless budget cuts that just keep it in a perpetual state of high unemployment, but then gives in at the last minute. On second thought, history is just repeating itself as tragedy over and over again. More here: Europe is destroying Greece\u2019s economy for no reason at all In case you missed it, our economics editor Larry Elliott has explained why the latest Greek proposal falls short: The troika plan for the Greek economy has already failed twice, and it will fail for a third time if the economically illiterate plan being foisted on Athens is adopted. Greece requires growth and debt relief, but the proposals currently being discussed provide neither...... Greece has a number of severe economic problems. It suffers from a lack of demand, and a five-year slump has pushed it into deflation. Falling prices have added to the real, inflation-adjusted burden of the government\u2019s debt, which currently stands at 175% of GDP. A fresh dose of austerity will make all these problems worse. And as this chart shows, Greece has already been imposing a very significant fiscal tightening. EU officials are cagey about the chances of a breakthrough finally coming tonight, reports The Economist\u2019s Tom Nuttall. Don\u2019t make any plans for the weekend. Assuming a deal is reached soon, Greek MPs could hold a three-day debate on the package, starting on Saturday. According to the Financial Times, Germany is insisting that the Greek parliament approves the new reform plan by Monday, before any aid is handed over People briefed on Berlin\u2019s thinking said months of fraught negotiations since the radical anti-austerity government came to power have undermined trust in Greece\u2019s ability to fuflill its promises. German officials want Greek parliamentary approval before an extension of its bailout programme is presented to the Bundestag before it expires on Tuesday More here: Berlin insists Greek parliament approves all reforms by Monday Austria\u2019s finance minister has warned that Greece must produce a full timetable for implementing economic reforms, in order to get a deal. Hans J\u00f6rg Schelling also warned Austrian radio station that a cut-and-dried solution must be found by Sunday: \u201cI expect that this will be offered by this evening ... If there is no real solution by Sunday this week, it is not foreseeable what the next step will be.\u201d The EC is also seeking a list of \u2018prior actions\u2019 from Greece; perhaps concerned that Athens will struggle to implement reforms. Good morning. Greece\u2019s future is in the balance today as Europe\u2019s top politicians head back to Brussels for another series of top-level meetings. At 7pm CEST (6pm BST) eurozone finance ministers will hold their third Eurogroup meeting in a week, in a bid to end months of tortuous negotiations. If they actually agree to the list of Greek reforms, then we could be a crucial step closer to a deal. But several hurdles lie ahead. Last night it emerged that Greece\u2019s creditors are split over the details of the latest proposal from Athens \u2013 with the International Monetary Fund not sharing the European Commissions optimistic view of the situation. As we wrote last night: The mild euphoria that characterised frantic diplomacy and another eurozone summit in Brussels on Monday dissolved swiftly on Tuesday as it became clear that Lagarde found the proposed temporary resolution inadequate and that German chancellor Angela Merkel was also having second thoughts.... Lagarde, who kept a low profile at Monday\u2019s emergency summit, was said to have strong reservations about the proposed agreement on ideological terms opposed to the hard-left Tsipras government, but also because she does not think the putative agreement will put Greece on the road to recovery. Sources familiar with Merkel\u2019s thinking said the German leader faced a potential party revolt over extending a further lifeline to Greece without confidence it would succeed. EU Observer has a good take too: The IMF \u201cthinks that the numbers are too soft,\u201d an EU source said, referring to the fiscal targets, pensions and VAT levels under discussion. More here: Greece\u2019s creditors differ on bailout agreement And that\u2019s why Greek PM Alexis Tsipras is being hauled back to Belgium to meet the heads of the IMF, ECB, European Commission and the Eurogroup. They will attempt to resolve the remaining issues, so that EU leaders can sign the deal off on Thursday night. As we covered in yesterday\u2019s liveblog, many experts fear that the \u20ac8bn squeeze on pensioners, consumers and firms contained in the proposals will wreck further harm on an already-weakened economy. This is simply not what Tsipras was elected to deliver. As Syriza MP Costas Lapavitsas put it: \u201cMany MPs, be them on the left or not, are very sceptical about accepting such a programme. \u201cHow will they explain it to their voters? How will they return to their electoral constituencies and explain this agreement to them?\u201d That means getting this deal through the Athens parliament will not be easy. The possibility of fresh elections or a referendum hasn\u2019t evaporated, if Tsipras cannot get his own party onside. And the sight of protesters on the streets of the capital last night has shown that public anger over the prospect of fresh austerity is building. And here\u2019s very little time left - Greece\u2019s bailout programme expires in less than a week. There\u2019s still optimism in the financial markets that a deal will be reached. But this story has a few twists and turns in it yet. We\u2019ll be tracking all the main events through another crunch day in the crisis.....",

It\u2019s not likely to go down well.<br></p> <p>With a majority of only 11 MPs, Tsipras will seek approval from the 200 MPs that form the Central Committee of Syriza. According to Greek press reports, 10-40 Syriza MPs are likely to revolt. Syriza\u2019s junior coalition partner, the Independent Greeks, have also indicated that they could withdraw from the government.

The IMF board, right from the beginning, found it hard to accept and \u201cit created resentment and a lot of skepticism\u201d within the institution, adds Landau, who knows the IMF well, having been its French board member in the early nineties.</p> <p>The Greek bailout also created a precedent in terms of size. It was the largest ever implemented by the IMF, as a percentage of a given country\u2019s stake in the Fund. Between the first and second bailout in 2012, the IMF ended up loaning about \u20ac30 billion to Greece. Some \u20ac23 billion is still owed, to be paid back until the end of 2030, starting with \u20ac5.5 billion due by the end of this year.</p> <p>Then there were the forecasting mistakes. Sterne notes for example that the IMF revised down its estimate for Greece\u2019s 2014 gross domestic product by some 22 percent in the space of 18 months. \u201cIn U.S. terms, that is the equivalent of revising away the combined output of the whole of California, New York and Florida,\u201d he writes.</p> </blockquote> <h2><a href=\"http://www.politico.eu/article/imf-greece-grexit-lagarde-dsk-sex-parties-eurozone/\">Why the IMF\u2019s so hard on Greece</a></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/PatrickPechmann/statuses/613602611032403968\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">The IMF\u2019s role in <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Greece?src=hash\">#Greece</a> has been \u201cone of the most credibility-sapping in its history\u201d. <a href=\"http://t.co/Ifv8a5G2Kq\">http://t.co/Ifv8a5G2Kq</a></p>&mdash; Patrick Pechmann (@PatrickPechmann) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/PatrickPechmann/status/613602611032403968\">June 24, 2015</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-558aa721e4b024f829c5d1ee\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2015-06-24T12:53:41.195Z\">1.53pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>A senior German official has told Reuters that any aid-for-reforms deal with Greece must include the support of the International Monetary Fund:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The official said that it was important for Berlin to have the IMF at the table, both for its expertise and its role in financing Greece.</p> </blockquote> <p><em>Of course, the IMF\u2019s \u201cexpertise\u201d means it believes <a href=\"http://blog-imfdirect.imf.org/2015/06/14/greece-a-credible-deal-will-require-difficult-decisions-by-all-sides/\">Greece needs debt relief </a>- an issue Germany isn\u2019t terribly happy about confronting at this stage.</em></p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-558aa328e4b024f829c5d1e0\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2015-06-24T12:32:22.511Z\">1.32pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The Athens stock market was deep in the red as Alexis Tsipras\u2019s meeting with creditors began - down around 4.5%.

Its debt should have been written down in 2010, but it wasn\u2019t because it was \u201cbailed out\u201d to the extent that it was given money to then give to French and German banks. The longer Europe pretends this new debt will be paid back, the longer Greece\u2019s depression will go on. Now, it\u2019s true that Europe has lowered the interest rates and extended the maturities on Greece\u2019s debt so far out that, for now at least, it\u2019s like a lot of it doesn\u2019t exist.

      "bodyText": "The Queensland government has denied being responsible for delays that the Indian coal giant Adani has cited as its reason for halting crucial engineering work for its contentious Carmichael mine project. Adani spoke of a \u201ccritical\u201d need to finalise \u201capprovals and timelines\u201d after Guardian Australia reported on Wednesday that the company had suspended work by four major contractors on related rail and port projects. But the office of the state\u2019s mining minister, Anthony Lynham, said: \u201cTo date, all state regulatory processes have been completed to schedule.\u201d A senior engineering source told Guardian Australia that Adani had cited state government delays when stopping work by WorleyParsons and Aecon on the rail joint venture, Aurecon on the port expansion and SMEC on other work. But the source said the move \u201cmade no sense\u201d as a savings measure and the state government\u2019s insistence no delays had occurred raised further questions about the company\u2019s future intentions. \u201cIf there are no delays, why isn\u2019t the engineering going ahead?\u201d he said, adding that Adani\u2019s move raised the question it could be preparing to retreat from the project. The Greens senator Larissa Waters said the project was \u201ceconomically and environmentally reckless [and] clearly now in its death throes\u201d. \u201cThe wheels are falling off this project because global coal prices have tanked and renewable energy technology is surging ahead,\u201d she said. \u201cFive years in and Adani still can\u2019t find anyone to finance this white elephant. The only person who was short-sighted enough to want finance this white elephant was Campbell Newman, with taxpayers\u2019 money, which Queenslanders booted him out for.\u201d Adani said on Wednesday it remained committed to the Carmichael mine and Abbot Point projects. \u201cHowever, it is important to note we are now into the fifth year of development and approvals and therefore the need to finalise those approvals and timelines is critical,\u201d it said. \u201cFor the past six to 12 months, Adani has maintained a level of investment, jobs and subcontractor engagement for its mine, rail and port projects in anticipation of finalising approvals and decisions. The project budget was based, understandably, on these anticipated approvals timelines and milestones. \u201cAs a result of changes to a range of approvals over that time, it\u2019s necessary to synchronise our budget, project timelines and spending to meet those changes.\u201d A spokeswoman for Lynham said the state\u2019s top bureaucrat, the coordinator general Barry Broe, would \u201cdiscuss any issues Adani may have on Friday at their next fortnightly meeting\u201d. This included possible use of his powers to supersede local council planning regulations for major projects \u201cwhere needed\u201d. The spokeswoman said timely approvals granted by the state government included environmental impact statements for the mine and rail line. It had also dealt with applications for a power station to run the mine, an airport, quarries, two camps for temporary workers and a 1,700-bed camp for permanent workers. Land acquisition for the rail line was on schedule and applications for the port and rail were before Edwards for assessment. Lynham\u2019s spokeswoman said the government made \u201cno apologies\u201d for scrapping the former Newman government\u2019s plan to dump dredging spoil \u201cin sensitive wetlands to protect the Great Barrier Reef\u201d. That plan itself came after public outcry at the former government\u2019s approval to dump the spoil in reef waters. The Palaszczuk government has negotiated for the spoil to be dumped on an empty industrial area next to the port. \u201cThe people of Queensland elected us with a commitment to protect the reef,\u201d the spokeswoman said. \u201cOur action to save the reef and progress the project has required a full environmental impact statement, as determined by the commonwealth.\u201d The draft impact statement on the dredge dump plan was expected to be released for public input next month before being updated and sent to the commonwealth for assessment. Progress in the meantime included public tenders for dredging for the port, the spokeswoman said. Mark Ogge, a spokesman for the Australia Institute, said the dredging and port construction work \u201cseemingly at taxpayer expense, directly contradicts\u201d Lynham\u2019s promise in March that those costs would be paid by miners. \u201cNo doubt Adani and other coalminers have promised the government they will pay them back in the future,\u201d he said. \u201cTreasury is equally clear that there is real opportunity cost for governments in spending on ports with the hope of future payments. The money takes a long time to arrive and, with current coal markets, a long time could turn into never.\u201d",

It had also dealt with applications for a power station to run the mine, an airport, quarries, two camps for temporary workers and a 1,700-bed camp for permanent workers.</p> <p>Land acquisition for the rail line was on schedule and applications for the port and rail were before Edwards for assessment.</p> <p>Lynham\u2019s spokeswoman said the government made \u201cno apologies\u201d for scrapping the former Newman government\u2019s plan to dump dredging spoil \u201cin sensitive wetlands to protect the Great Barrier Reef\u201d. That plan itself came after public outcry at the former government\u2019s approval to dump the spoil in reef waters. The Palaszczuk government has negotiated for the spoil to be dumped on an empty industrial area next to the port.<br></p> <p>\u201cThe people of Queensland elected us with a commitment to protect the reef,\u201d the spokeswoman said. \u201cOur action to save the reef and progress the project has required a full environmental impact statement, as determined by the commonwealth.\u201d</p> <p>The draft impact statement on the dredge dump plan was expected to be released for public input next month before being updated and sent to the commonwealth for assessment. Progress in the meantime included public tenders for dredging for the port, the spokeswoman said.</p> <p>Mark Ogge, a spokesman for the Australia Institute, said the dredging and port construction work \u201cseemingly at taxpayer expense, directly contradicts\u201d Lynham\u2019s promise in March that those costs would be paid by miners. \u201cNo doubt Adani and other coalminers have promised the government they will pay them back in the future,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cTreasury is equally clear that there is real opportunity cost for governments in spending on ports with the hope of future payments. The money takes a long time to arrive and, with current coal markets, a long time could turn into never.\u201d<br></p>",

The electrification of the Midland mainline linking London to Sheffield, described as \u201ccritical to maintaining a reliable railway\u201d, is likely to be axed from the schedule as ministers attempt to get to grips with Network Rail\u2019s soaring costs. The transport secretary, Patrick McLoughlin, is expected to announce on Thursday that the dramatic spending increase for projects such as the electrification of the Great Western line has made pledges in the five-year plan untenable. The funding gap between the original estimates, which were submitted before a full detailed assessment of the work was carried out, and the forecast final bill for the railway upgrades runs into billions. Where Network Rail has previously borrowed relatively freely, it is now coming under pressure to reduce its liabilities since these were added to the government balance sheet last September, effectively nationalising the company. Last month, it published accounts showing its debt had risen almost \u00a35bn in a year to \u00a337.8bn. A critical report from the regulator said Network Rail had missed more than a third of its targets in the first year of its five-year plan, raising \u201cserious questions about its ability to deliver future projects\u201d. The Treasury is understood to have sought ways to restructure Network Rail, something McLoughlin refused to rule out in the House of Commons, although the government has backed the company\u2019s chief executive, Mark Carne, to improve Network Rail\u2019s performance. Network Rail has said it has \u201crecognised the scale of the challenge\u201d but argues that it operates the safest passenger network in Europe and that the railway is now more reliable than ever following previous underinvestment. The Department for Transport said in a statement: \u201cWe have seen passenger numbers double over the past 20 years. Our railways are carrying more passengers than ever before. Network Rail is delivering \u00a338bn of investment in the network. \u201cThe government has overseen a massive programme of work on the railways over the past five years and is committed to ensuring passengers get a railway they can rely on.\u201d There was some relief for Network Rail on Wednesday as the threat of a nationwide rail strike was lifted when unions finally agreed on a pay deal. Two scheduled strikes were postponed at the 11th hour last month after an improved offer. Members of the RMT, TSSA and Unite unions have now all voted to accept a two-year deal that will include a 2% pay rise this year and guarantees against job losses.",

Without question, this makes life tough for the Greek prime minister, who thought the concessions offered on Monday were as much as he could deliver politically. Tsipras bridled at the demands from the troika to cross all his red lines and that means the crisis is back on again. Athens should not have been entirely surprised by the response given that the International Monetary Fund \u2013 one third of the troika \u2013 thinks a repair job on the public finances should be structured so that 80% of the improvement comes through spending cuts and 20% from tax increases. The plan put forward by Tsipras was skewed in the other direction. Of the \u20ac7.9bn (\u00a35.6bn) that the Greek government said the plan would raise, 92% came from tax increases. In the unlikely event that the extra revenues were collected in full, the IMF believes the one-off levy on bigger businesses coupled with the increases in corporation tax would hinder growth. It thinks the Greek plan will only add up if there are immediate cuts in pensions and higher VAT on restaurants and medical supplies. Olivier Blanchard, the IMF\u2019s chief economist, explained its reasoning earlier this month. Greece\u2019s creditors, he said, were prepared to accept that the state of the economy meant it was now impossible to meet the target of running a 3% primary budget surplus (revenues minus spending, excluding debt interest payments) in 2015, and that a lower 1% goal would now be acceptable to creditors. \u201cWe believe that even the lower new target cannot be credibly achieved without a comprehensive reform of the VAT \u2013 involving a widening of its base \u2013 and a further adjustment of pensions\u201d, Blanchard said in a blogpost. \u201cWhy insist on pensions? Pensions and wages account for about 75% of primary spending; the other 25% have already been cut to the bone. Pension expenditures account for over 16% of GDP, and transfers from the budget to the pension system are close to 10% of GDP. We believe a reduction of pension expenditures of 1% of GDP (out of 16%) is needed, and that it can be done while protecting the poorest pensioners. We are open to alternative ways for designing both the VAT and the pension reforms, but these alternatives have to add up and deliver the required fiscal adjustment.\u201d The response from the Greek government is that the Fund\u2019s sums don\u2019t add up either, and won\u2019t add up unless budget savings are accompanied by a hefty dollop of debt relief. Analysis by the London-based consultancy Capital Economics suggests that Tsipras is right. When the IMF reviewed its programme in Greece in July 2014 it assumed that Greek debt would fall from its current 175% of GDP to 120% of GDP by 2020, a level considered sustainable. For that to happen, though, the Greek economy would need to grow by 3% this year and at similar level for the rest of the decade, inflation would have to average between 1% and 2% a year, and Athens would need to run a primary budget surplus of 4% a year. None of these assumptions looks remotely plausible. Greece\u2019s economy will contract this year; it has deflation, not inflation; and it can only run primary surpluses of 4% a year by keeping the economy in permanent recession. Using a different \u2013 perhaps more realistic \u2013 set of assumptions (1% average growth, 0.5% inflation, 2% primary budget surplus), Greece\u2019s debt to GDP ratio would continue rising. Debt relief would help square the circle. It would limit the need for further austerity, and it would be less politically toxic in Greece. The IMF knows this and has been pressing for it. But debt relief is being resisted by Greece\u2019s European partners, who think it would mean their taxpayers paying for a writedown. Nor do they want anti-austerity parties in Spain and Portugal to be emboldened. So they have left Tsipras with a choice: surrender unconditionally or walk.",

      "bodyText": "Russia has overtaken Saudi Arabia as the largest supplier of oil to China for the first time, sending almost 930,000 barrels a day last month \u2013 up 21% on April. China imported 3.92m tonnes of crude oil from Russia in May. In comparison, oil imports from Angola and Saudia Arabia totalled 3.26m tonnes and 3.05m tonnes respectively. Russian exports to China have more than doubled since 2010, according to analysis by the Financial Times. As western sanctions over the Ukraine crisis started to bite, Moscow has had to seek alternative markets and friends. It has been, understandably, keen to strengthen ties with Beijing. Russia steps up relations with China The fact that Russia now accepts yuan for oil payments (Saudi Arabia doesn\u2019t) undoubtedly also helped it top the oil supplier ranking. The rouble-yuan currency pair reached record highs in trading volumes last summer as Russian companies and banks, traditionally dependent on dollar-denominated syndicated loans, looked to China. In 2013, Russia\u2019s largest oil producer, Rosneft,signed an $85bn deal with China\u2019s Sinopec to deliver 100m tonnes of crude over 10 years. On top of that, Rosneft struck a $270bn deal to double oil supplies to China. Last year, a 30-year deal was signed by the state-owned gas company Gazprom worth $400bn to deliver gas to China. Last year, oil prices and the rouble both fell to five-year lows. The slump was bad news for Russia\u2019s economy, which is strongly dependent on oil, and very sensitive to price changes. Analysts warned that plummeting crude prices could send the economy into a recession. Oil and gas make up around half of government income, and more than 60% of Russia\u2019s exports. Calculations at the time shows Russia needs an oil price of $105 a barrel for its budget to break-even; the country loses about $12bn-$14bn a year in revenue for every $10 decrease in the barrel price. China is not the only way Russia has been attempting to diversify economically. Last year its central bank went on a massive gold buying spree, and earlier this year it reduced the dollar\u2019s share in its international reserves below that of the euro for the first time since 2008.",

Though Adoboli\u2019s losses are the biggest accumulated by a City trader, their impact was not as great as those of Nick Leeson, whose secret trading caused the merchant bank Barings to collapse in 1995.",

      "bodyText": "Abby Shorter is beaming. She has been fitting radiators all morning in a block of new flats in south London and it is going well. \u201cI like to see a project grow and progress. It is very rewarding,\u201d says the 24-year-old. Shorter is a rare thing in construction: a skilled young recruit at the end of a plumbing apprenticeship. For the last two years, in college classrooms and on construction sites, the former retail manager has been learning about combi boilers, taps, toilet pans \u2013 she prefers fitting brand new ones to repairing used ones. After this job, she moves on to a new site and can barely contain her excitement about the pipework. \u201cThis job is all plastic but the next job is all copper. With copper there is more of an art to it. You can bend the pipework in a way that it looks nice, there are soldering techniques.\u201d Her skills are in high demand as the construction sector clambers out of its deep recession. Work is picking up but builders say the struggle to find the right people is holding back growth and pushing up costs. It is a picture echoed across the UK economy, with employment at a record high. On the surface the labour market looks to have put the recession behind it, but concerns about skills shortages are growing. Perhaps nowhere are the warnings so loud as in the construction sector after it shed thousands of skilled workers in the downturn. Business surveys suggest the demand for subcontractors is soaring as vacancies remain unfilled. The average advertised salary in the sector is up 14% on a year ago to \u00a338,813, according to the jobs search engine Adzuna. The number of vacancies is up 28% on the year \u2013 beating the 26% increase Adzuna reports across all UK industries. New work picking up The skills shortage is something the project manager on Shorter\u2019s site knows all too well. Stuart Millichamp says about 70 of the 100 contractors working on this apartment building are from outside the UK. \u201cI can\u2019t emphasise enough that these guys are very good at their jobs and we have a long way to go to ensure we get people coming into the industry that are the same kind of standard,\u201d he says. \u201cBut it\u2019s worrying for the British economy isn\u2019t it, that at some point in the future we will have no one coming into the industry and will be completely reliant on others.\u201d Millichamp, who is project manager for the construction company Willmott Dixon, says the average age of a heating engineer is over 40 and that the building trade urgently needs young recruits like Shorter. But finding the funds and time to train them remains a challenge. Subcontractors such as plumbing companies outbid each other to get work with bigger firms like Willmott Dixon, which means margins are tight. \u201cThe state of construction in the last five or six years means people don\u2019t have the means to invest in the trade any more,\u201d says Millichamp. \u201cIf they are putting in apprentices that need to have people with them all the time, that is not being cost efficient.\u201d The mismatch between the sector\u2019s need for skilled workers and its training record was the inspiration behind K10, the social enterprise running Shorter\u2019s apprenticeship scheme. \u201cNo one owns the problem,\u201d says K10\u2019s chief executive, Andrew Purvis. \u201cConstruction has a fragmented supply chain of contractors and subcontractors: the people making the investment are a long, long way from the people building the building.\u201d At the same time, there are 943,000 young people in the UK who are not in education, employment or training (Neets). \u201cOne in 10 jobs in Britain is in construction and there is all this building going on and all these young people out of work,\u201d says Purvis. Completing a construction apprenticeship guarantees more than just a job, he says. It opens up a career with rising earning potential \u2013 even if it is hard work to stick at. \u201cConstruction is a tough sector. Not just because it\u2019s outdoors, it\u2019s a 7.30am start everyday, there is zero tolerance for drugs and alcohol, you can get away with a lot less than in a white-collar job,\u201d says Purvis. \u201cWe are working with young people. If you have 10, two won\u2019t show up.\u201d Then there is the pay. K10\u2019s minimum wage is \u00a33.60, the national minimum wage for apprentices is \u00a32.73. \u201cYou are going to be on a very tight belt for the time of your apprenticeship but it\u2019s an investment in your future,\u201d says Purvis. Shorter was on the national minimum wage of \u00a36.50 on her last job and worked 40 hours a week on site as well as another 25 hours in a restaurant at the weekend to top up her income. She is now becoming self-employed and finds she can make \u00a310-\u00a312 an hour. \u201cIt\u2019s only really been a year, two years that I have been working really hard and now I am starting to see the light at the end of the tunnel, I\u2019m starting to see I can make good money,\u201d she says. K10 signed on 184 new apprentices last year and wants to grow that markedly over coming years. It is optimistic given the strong pipeline of building projects in and around London and thanks to an investment via Big Society Capital, a financial institution set up by the Cabinet Office to build the UK\u2019s social investment market. Strong pipeline The industry knows such local schemes will only go some way to tackling the chronic skills shortage. But the latest government push on apprenticeships is encouraging, says the Federation of Master Builders (FMB). The skills minister, Nick Boles, has unveiled plans to create 3m apprenticeships by 2020. Brian Berry, FMB\u2019s chief executive, welcomed that target but pointed out reforms would be needed to achieve it. \u201cAs construction accounts for about 7% of GDP, it means our sector should be responsible for around 210,000 of these apprenticeships, which equates to 42,000 a year over the next parliament. Given that the industry only achieved 16,000 in 2013/2014, there is a lot of work to be done,\u201d he says. The trade groups say that with almost 40% of construction output coming from the public sector, government must only award contracts to those who take on apprentices. \u201cIn the past, there has been evidence to suggest that pledges by firms to train apprentices have not transpired. Government needs to get better at policing its contractual stipulations if we are to really crank up the level of apprenticeships via the public sector,\u201d says Berry.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Greece\u2019s minister of state Nikos Pappas has said the deal with the country\u2019s lenders will be backed by parliament and supported by the people, according to Reuters. And on that positive note, it\u2019s time to close up for the evening. Thanks for all your comments and we\u2019ll be back again tomorrow. More marches: Back in Athens, the government\u2019s junior coalition partner, the small right-wing Independent Greeks party (Anel), has made resolution of Greece\u2019s debt problem, a precondition of its support of any deal that is eventually reached, reports Helena Smith. \u201cOur red lines remain,\u201d Panos Kammenos, the party\u2019s leader, is reported to have told MPs who (as we flagged earlier) met in extraordinary session this afternoon to discuss the government\u2019s proposed reforms. \u201cIt is now very clear that it is Greece that is negotiating, not simply a government that is negotiating. We hope that the course of negotiations will be positive for the Greek people.\u201d Parliamentary endorsement of the agreement would be premised on whether the debt issue was tackled with a legal commitment on the part of creditors to some form of debt relief, party members said. Elimination of tax exemptions on Greek islands was another red line that the Independent Greeks would not cross \u201ceven if the government falls,\u201d kammenos was quoted as telling MPs. Signs that Greece and its creditors might be edging towards a deal ahead of the deadline for bailout funds to run out have again given investors cause for optimism. Equities have moved higher again and Greek bond yields slipped back, but everyone is still too well aware there are still some hurdles to negotiate. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished 9.20 points or 0.13% higher at 6834.87 Germany\u2019s Dax was 0.72% higher at 11,542.54 France\u2019s Cac closed up 1.1% at 5057.68 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB edged up 0.35% to 23,567.25 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended 0.3% better at 11,402.5 The Athens market jumped 6.11% to 794.98 On Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 7 points. Over in Athens, a top government officials reiterated this afternoon that an agreement, when (if?) sealed, would be put before parliament for vote possibly as early as this weekend, reports Helena Smith. As negotiations continue in Brussels there is mounting speculation in Athens that an agreement will be reached by Friday \u2013 and brought before the 300-seat House for endorsement possibly as early as the weekend. Speaking to the leftist radio station Kokkino.gr, the minister of state, Alekos Flambouraris, said there would be no quashing of dissent. Parliamentarians would vote on the legislation according to their conscience and not under the threat of party discipline. In the event of the legislation not being passed, \u201cit would have to be resolved by resorting to the people,\u201d he said. \u201cI think the government will achieve an agreement which is quite difficult but indispensible in my view,\u201d said the politician widely seen as mentor to prime minister Alexis Tsipras. \u201cThere will not be an issue of discipline,\u201d he added, insisting that it was vital the deal won the backing of the majority of government MPs. \u201cFor the government to forge ahead in difficult conditions after the agreement, and to restart the economy and kick-start the country\u2019s productive reconstruction, it has to have a unanimous parliamentary group which will put the programme into effect,\u201d Flambouraris said. The politician insisted that the debt issue was now being addressed as the leftist-led government had put it on the table. Athens\u2019 hope was that it would secure a commitment from creditors acknowledging the need to resolve Greece\u2019s unsustainable debt mountain. Here\u2019s Reuters snapshot of the MNI report: IMF &amp; EC still have differences in approach to Greek deal-MNI citing sources Creditors working on expectation that IMF will \u201ccome on board\u201d by Thurs summit IMF objects to Greek proposals emphasising taxes &amp; less spending cuts Small differences to be ironed out, 6-mth extension likely to be introduced A potential problem perhaps, as apparently flagged up by news agency MNI: The IMF is keener on spending cuts that tax rises so this fits it with its general thinking, but the key question is whether any disagreement would disrupt a deal to release the necessary bailout funds to Greece. Perhaps not: Here\u2019s an early picture of the pensioners protest in Greece: Any agreement between Greece and its creditors may not yet be done, but the progress that seems to have been made in the past day or so has continued to give a sense of optimism to the markets. So the Athens stock market has ended the day up 6.11% - making a two day rise of 15.66% - while on the bond markets, the yield on Greece\u2019s two year paper has fallen from 23.77% on Monday to 21.04%. More talk about how things may progress (or not) from here: And here\u2019s why some may be unhappy with the Greek proposals: Emergency funding from the Bank of Greece to the country\u2019s banks rose by 4.3% in May to \u20ac77.58bn, new figures have shown. Of course Greek prime minister Alexis Tsipras still has to get any agreement through his own parliament: Gabriel added, \u201cWe will see if the Greek proposals are sufficient. If not, we\u2019ll have to keep talking.\u201d Germany\u2019s vice chancellor Sigmar Gabriel has joined the chorus saying there is now a chance of agreement, although he adds that a debt haircut for Greece would be no use if new debts were racked up (quotes courtesy Reuters): 23-Jun-2015 14:24:23 - GERMAN VICE CHANCELLOR GABRIEL SAYS IT WOULD BE POLITICALLY AND ECONOMICALLY BAD IF GREECE LEFT THE EUROPEAN HOUSE 23-Jun-2015 14:25:05 - GERMANY\u2019S GABRIEL SAYS STILL SEE THE POSSIBILITY FOR AN AGREEMENT ON GREECE NOW PROPOSALS ARE ON THE TABLE 23-Jun-2015 14:25:24 - GABRIEL SAYS GERMANY AND EUROPE CANNOT ALLOW THEMSELVES TO BE BLACKMAILED 23-Jun-2015 14:26:26 - GABRIEL SAYS DEBT HAIRCUT FOR GREECE WOULD NOT LEAD ANYWHERE IF NEW DEBTS ARE SOON ACCUMULATED If a deal is done, then Greece is unlikely to miss its \u20ac1.6bn payment to the International Monetary Fund due at the end of the month. But as a reminder here is what would happen if it did: Time for a recap. The Greek government has come under fire over the compromise proposal it submitted to its lenders on Monday, amid warnings that it will hurt growth and cost jobs. Government spokesman Gavriel Sakellarides told Ant 1 TV. \u201cWe are fully aware that there are in the proposal, measures that are hard and which under other circumstances we would never take.\u201d According to Sakellarides, Greece\u2019s plan will create \u201cbreathing space\u201d to support the recovery, and also spare the country from plunging out of its bailout programme within days. Greece\u2019s plan will squeeze around \u20ac8bn out of its economy in the next 18 months, though a series of measures, including: Charging higher VAT rates on many products, Imposing a higher corporation tax rate, and a windfall tax on profits Raising pension contributions, and phasing out some early retirement schemes. Greece sent the proposal in yesterday morning, having spent months trying in vain to persuade its lenders to accept less onerous budget surplus targets, and thus fewer cuts and tax rises. The plan has triggered a backlash in Athens, with government and opposition MPs criticising the plan - and the time it has taken to reach a potential agreement. Business leaders fear it will trigger renewed recession, and called for more growth-friendly measures. Restaurant chains have predicted thousands of job cuts, if VAT on food sales is hiked to 23% Pensioners are due to protest tonight, having been hit hard since the crisis began. And economists warn that it will hurt the Greek economy badly. The European Commission has hinted that it will provide investment funding to Greece to help the country recover. That money would come from Jean-Claude Juncker\u2019s \u20ac350bn Investment Plan for Europe, which aims to leverage private sector funding - so there\u2019s no guarantee exactly how much money is around. Still, it could help repaid Greece\u2019s shattered economy, and perhaps sugar some of the pain of fresh austerity measures. In other news..... Eurozone finance ministers are to meet on Wednesday night at 7pm, to have one last attempt to agree on Greece\u2019s economic reform proposals. It could be a late one..... Commissioner Pierre Moscovici, never the most pessimistic man in the room, says he\u2019s convinced that a deal will be reached. The European Central Bank has agreed to provide around \u20ac1bn in extra emergency liquidity to Greece\u2019s banks. Financial markets continue to price in a high chance of a breakthrough. The Athens stock market is now up 5% in late afternoon trading, on top of yesterday\u2019s 9% surge. And Greek bonds are rallying, pushing down the yield on its 10-year bonds down to around 10.6%, from 11.2% yesterday. Here\u2019s a handy list of the Greek proposals which are now being examined by officials from its lenders right now: Economist Sean Richards fears that these \u20ac8bn of tax rises will have a very serious impact on the economy. He writes: When I see headlines proclaiming that the new deal offers hope for Greece I do wonder what universe the writers are living in! The cycle so far involves Greece implementing austerity followed by economic weakness and at times collapse which means that yet more austerity is required and then repeat. On that road the economy has shrunk by a quarter and real wages have fallen by a third. What has been done to Greece is bad enough but to learn so little from it that you are willing to do it again seems insane under the Albert Einstein definition. Even worse is the fact that one of the ways that Greece entered its crisis was an inability to collect its taxes particularly on the wealthy and its equivalent of the oligarchs. Thus a solution essentially based on higher taxes has an obvious flaw. It seems that US Treasury Secretary Tim Geither was correct that Euro leaders wanted to punish Greece and the current form of that seems to be making sure that it remains in its ongoing economic depression. Over in Athens the business community has reacted with horror to the Greek government\u2019s proposed reform package. Helena Smith reports It\u2019s not only politicians who are up in arms over the purported measures. Greece\u2019s biggest chamber of commerce has also waded in saying the proposed measures will stymie growth and worsen recession and joblessness, the latter already at record levels. While moving in the right direction and keeping bankruptcy at bay, the proposal might well make Greece\u2019s plight a great deal worse, businessmen said. \u201cThe proposed measures throw all the weight on the privately-run economy with new taxes and increases in contributions that more than certain will lead to recession and an increase in unemployment,\u201d the Hellenic-American Chamber of Commerce\u2019s president Simos Anastasopoulos announced. \u201cA proposal with a different mix of measures and growth plan would satisfy the demands of a viable solution.\u201d But echoing a widely held view this morning, Anastasopoulos noted that an agreement was better than no agreement, given Greece\u2019s urgent need for funds. And the former leader of the socialist PASOK party, Evangelos Venizelos, has criticised prime minister Alexis Tsipras\u2019s handling of the situation, saying: \u201cRelief that the country has averted catastrophe, that the government itself threatened it with - five years after 2010 - can\u2019t hide the fact that we got here in the worse possible way.\u201d We\u2019d like to hear from Greeks about their experiences of living with the economic situation in Greece.

Eurozone finance ministers are to meet tomorrow night to discuss the Greek crisis, according to reports from Brussels. That\u2019s the third meeting in six days, and surely the last chance to sign off an agreement. The Athens stock market is rallying hard today, as the risk of Greece leaving the euro decline. The main ATG index is up another 4.4%, having surged by 9% on Monday: Greece\u2019s newspapers are united in warning that the country faces fresh pain, thanks to the \u20ac8bn of new tax rises and cuts contained in yesterday proposals submitted by Athens: The cost of buying protection against a Greek default has fallen sharply today, as this chart of credit default swap prices (which pay out if Athens defaults) shows: There are mounting signs that Greeks are not going to take the new measures lying down, despite the government\u2019s attempts to defend the plan this morning. Helena Smith reports: Pensioners have announced that they will be taking to the streets at 6pm (4pm BST) in what they say will be a mass display of protest against the leftist-led government\u2019s proposed austerity package. Some 70 coaches, packed with retirees, are currently on their way to Athens. I have just spoken to Manolis Rallakis, general secretary of the federation of Greek pensioners, who says older Greeks feel \u201ctotally betrayed\u201d by the tough measures envisaged in the leftist-led government\u2019s proposed austerity package. \u201cWe feel totally betrayed, totally disappointed, that this government is continuing the cut-throat policies that every other government also enforced. What we are seeing are countless indirect and direct taxes that, once again, the little man on the street will be forced to carry,\u201d the 75-year-old told me. \u201cPensions have been cut by between 60 and 40 percent and now they want more with additional income for health care and the like, services that we paid for all our working lives through contributions to funds. It is outrageous. Where are the 13 and 14th pensions that they stole from us? Why should we go on paying the price? The 13th and 14th payments were the two supplementary monthly incomes that pensioners received until they, too, were cut with the crisis. The plan presented by Greece yesterday includes higher \u201chealth contributions\u201d for pensioners, effectively cutting their income (see opening post) Nearly 45% of Greece\u2019s 2.5 million retirees now live on incomes of less than \u20ac665 a month \u2013 below the poverty line defined by the EU. Over half that number fell below the threshold at the start of the crisis in late 2009. The Greek communist trade union, Pame, will also take to the streets this afternoon to protest an agreement that will not only bankrupt but butcher people, it said. \u201cWe have shed enough blood and we have paid enough. Now is the time to resist!\u201d The Commission is dropping some heavy hints that it will announce a new stimulus programme to help Greece soon, once an economics reforms deal is agreed. Last night, Jean-Claude Juncker told reporters that: \u201cI want ordinary Greeks to know we are offering \u20ac35bn to help the economy\u201d And in today\u2019s press briefing, spokeswoman Annika Breidthardt explained that this money is available to Athens from the current Europe budget from 2014-2020. She says: The Commission is currently preparing a package on this... the package and the \u20ac35bn are conditional to the conditions being met, and obviously an agreement being found. More details on this package will be spelled out in the coming days, Breidthardt explains. \u201cSo stay tuned\u201d adds chief spokesman Margaritis Schinas, in case anyone had missed the nudge. This aid funding would be used to improve Greece\u2019s infrastructure, and fund projects for long-term growth. But the key issue with such projects is the issue of \u201cabsorption\u201d -- ie, getting the money to the right projects on the ground. Will the list of Greek \u2018prior actions\u2019 being demanded by creditors include a vote in the Athens parliament before June 30? Spokesman Margaritis Schinas declines to speculate - that will be addressed in tomorrow\u2019s eurogroup meeting. The EC is fielding questions from journalists in Brussels now about the Greek crisis, at the midday briefing. Was there any discussion about how Greece will pay the IMF on 30 June, as there isn\u2019t time to agree bailout payments in time? And is the IMF fully on board? Spokesman Margaritis Schinas says that work is taking place between the three institutions and the Greek government to clarify what still needs to be done, including a list of \u2018prior actions\u2019 that Greece must take before bailout funds are handed over. You\u2019ll have to ask the IMF yourself.... Schinas add that there is \u201cno extra time\u201d available for Greece, as Juncker said yesterday (well, he said no \u2018prolongation\u2019, which baffled some of us) Encouraging news for Tsipras, as he tries to hold his coalition together.... Analysts at UBS warn there\u2019s still a real risk that negotiations flounder. Here\u2019s a section of their latest research note: The threat of Greece leaving the eurozone anytime soon has receded, says Carsten Brzeski of ING. And the last-minute hiccup with the latest Greek proposals (they sent one version on Sunday night, and other early on Monday) has been smoothed out: At least yesterday, the blame game was suspended, in favour of a more cooperative approach, even if some Eurozone finance ministers obviously still felt a sour aftertaste. The late submission of the new Greek proposals did not help to reduce built-up irritations. Technical work will resume under a better omen, sustained by the continued support of the ECB. The next steps will be Wednesday\u2019s Eurogroup meeting and the European summit on Thursday and Friday. Judging from yesterday\u2019s events, it seems as if all players involved have finally started with constructive negotiations. This strengthens our view that a Grexit will be avoided, at least this time around. Over in Athens, Greek government officials are insisting this morning that negotiations are still ongoing \u2013 the outlines of a cash-for-reform deal may change yet. Helena Smith reports: Senior cabinet members this morning were putting on a brave face as Greeks woke up to what awaits them next: proposed reforms worth \u20ac8bn mostly in the form of tax hikes [details here]. \u201cThe climate has improved, we are closer to a solution. This of course depends on whether the institutions accept the government\u2019s proposal which is the basis for discussion and agreement,\u201d the government spokesman Gavriel Sakellarides told Ant 1 TV. \u201cWe are fully aware that there are in the proposal, measures that are hard and which under other circumstances we would never take.\u201d \u201cThe point of the measures was to transfer the burden from the poor to the rich\u201d, he said. \u201cWe are waging battle, there are many proposals that will allow growth and breathing space,\u201d he said singling out the reduction of the primary surplus as a major victory for the government. \u201cIt ensures fiscal benefit.\u201d Yannis Amanatidis, another prominent Syriza party cadre, said the agreement would end the political uncertainty that has had such a devastating effect on the real economy. \u201cThe agreement as it now stands ends the political uncertainty. It covers our financing needs,\u201d he told Skai TV. But others in the governing far left movement were less sanguine \u2013 and less diplomatic. \u201cIt is worse than the first memorandum,\u201d snapped Syriza MP Yannis Micheloyiannakis, saying that in its present form, the proposal would never be endorsed by the party\u2019s governing bodies. \u201cWith these new measures I estimate that Greeks will lose at least two salaries from their pockets,\u201d he added calling on prime minister Alexis Tsipras not to compromise. Across the political spectrum many bemoaned the fact that the deal was so top heavy on taxes. \u201cIt includes recessionary measures and 93% of them are taxes,\u201d said Kostas Hadzidakis, former development minister in the previous conservative-led government. The government, he countered, had been forced to accept such excoriating measures because the negotiations had gone on for so long and deficits in the meantime had grown. But still, Hadzidakis added: \u201cIt\u2019s a bad deal but I prefer a bad deal than rupture from the EU.\u201d Heads-up. ANEL, the junior partner in the Greek coalition, has called a meeting to discuss the situation. It\u2019s scheduled for 2.30pm Athens time, or 12.30pm BST, according to the To Vima newspaper. Senior ANEL members are concerned about the Greek plan, particularly the abolition of the reduced VAT rate on Greek islands. Their leader, Panos Kammenos, has made this his own \u2018red line\u2019 in negotiations, fearing that a VAT hike would drive islanders in the Aegean Sea to sail to Turkey to shop instead (as we reported yesterday) According to Reuters, the ECB has provided Greek banks with another \u20ac1bn of emergency liquidity today to keep them afloat while negotiations continue. That takes the total to \u20ac89bn. without which the Greek banks would simply have run out of funds: Last night, Greek insiders said that Mario Draghi had promised to keep supporting Greece\u2019s banks while the country was in a bailout programme. And the promise of extra liquidity should mean less pressure on Greeks to panic about a potential bank run. Not that they\u2019ve been panicking this week. As Angelique Christafis reported from Thessaloniki, many are simply worn out by years of crisis drama: Kit Juckes of French bank Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale warns that markets optimism can quickly fizzle out, especially where Greece is concerned. Assuming we do indeed get the last-minute deal everyone expects, then we will simply move on to wondering whether it can be ratified by individual parliaments and then, how long it will last before we need another one. Austria\u2019s finance minister has warned that Greece won\u2019t get any bailout funds unless it has actually agreed a plan to implement various measures: Hans J\u00f6rg Schelling said (via Reuters): \u201cIf there is no programme for actions that says what measure will be implemented when , we will not agree to it.\u201d The Athens stock market is also rising in early trading. The ATG index had gained 1.5%, adding to yesterday\u2019s 9% surge. Bank shares are among the big gainers: Newsnight\u2019s economics editor Duncan Weldon agrees that taxes on consumer spending and company profits, and raising pension contributions, will not help the economy return to sustainable growth - as the government had been pledging: Francesco Papadia, the former director General for Market Operations at the European Central Bank, warns that the Greek proposal fails on two fronts: it doesn\u2019t make the economy more competitive, and it doesn\u2019t deliver debt relief (yet, anyway....) Europe\u2019s investors remain upbeat about the prospect of Greek deal this week. Stocks have hit their highest level since the start of June in early trading, adding to yesterday\u2019s strong rally. The German DAX and the French CAC are both up 0.8% in early trading, with traders reacting to last night\u2019s upbeat comments from Donald Tusk and Jean-Claude Juncker.. Some caution might be advisable, given the the two sides are still hammering out the details today. As FXTM Chief Market Analyst Jameel Ahmal puts it: If recent history is anything to go by, there is likely to be a few more twists and turns before a deal is concluded but this is at least a positive sign. The strong gains in global markets just shows how much investors want a deal to be reached and everyone would much prefer it to be this way, rather than for the uncertainty over a looming default. Newsflash: The European Central Bank is rumoured to have agreed to provide more emergency liquidity to the Greek banking sector. That means the banks can keep running despite suffering a steady outflow of deposits - another \u20ac1.6bn is reported to have been withdrawn on Monday. The backlash against Greece\u2019s latest proposals is gathering pace this morning. The head of the association of restaurant chains, Thanassis Papanikolaou, has warned that hiking VAT on food service from 13% to 23% will hurt the service sector very badly. He told Kathimerini. \u201cWe have the experience from 2011 when the increase from 13 to 23 percent in food service brought the shutdown of 4,500 enterprises and the loss of 40,000 jobs.\u201d And with one in four adults out of work, this is the very last thing the Greek labour market needs now. The prospect of the Greek crisis vanishing off the front pages has also cheered investors in Japan, where the Nikkei index hit its highest level since the year 2000. After surging yesterday, European stock markets are tipped to keep rising this morning on renewed optimism of a deal this week. Having slept on it, EU commissioner Pierre Moscovici is still optimistic that Greece and its creditors are on the verge of a breakthrough. Moscovici has been speaking on the France Inter radio station, and told listeners that he is \u201cconvinced\u201d there will be an agreement this week. Progress was made at yesterday\u2019s \u201cuseful\u201d meetings, and the two sides have converged, he added. Our long-term goal is growth, job creation, and structural reforms, he adde.d Good morning. Greece and its creditors are locked in a race against time to finalise an agreement over its bailout before the end of the week. And the prospects look better than at any time in the last five months. The latest proposals submitted by Athens yesterday have been broadly welcomed by EU leaders, at last night\u2019s emergency summit. As European Council president Donald Tusk put it around midnight in Brussels: Today\u2019s proposals are a positive step....they will be assessed in the coming hours. And European Commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker, argued that there will a final agreement this week; simply because there has to be. But IMF chief Christine Lagarde put it best, We have a huge amount of work to do in the next 48 hours. Which means we now have only 41 hours to go.... The plan is to get a deal hammered out by Wednesday evening, when eurozone finance ministers will convene for yet another Eurogroup meeting. If they sign it off, EU leaders could give approval on Thursday, unlocking billions in aid loans and staving off the immediate risk of default. Technical officials from Greece and its creditors will be working hard today to see whether the proposals satisfy the demands of the IMF, the ECB and the EC. But there are already worries that Greece\u2019s latest plan is flawed. It includes an \u20ac8bn fiscal adjustment by the end of 2016, mainly through higher taxes on consumers and businesses, plus a squeeze on pension payments. And those measures could suck growth potential out of an economy that\u2019s already in recession: As Michael Hewson of CMC Markets puts it: There does appear to have been some shifting of ground on the Greeks part on pensions and VAT, as well as higher taxes on business, though with unemployment at record levels, increasing the level of taxes on businesses on their profits, as well as their employees does sound rather counterproductive, given that an estimated 8,500 businesses have closed since the beginning of the year already. And there are already signs that Tsipras will struggle to sell the deal in Athens: One leading Syriza party MP has already predicted that the Greek government\u2019s proposals will never get through parliament: Alexis Mitropoulos, vice president of the 300-seat House, told TV last night that: \u201cMy personal view is that these measures cannot be voted, they are extreme and anti-social. I believe that in the end, this package which you have at hand, cannot come to the Greek parliament.\u201d We\u2019ll be watching all the key developments through the day.....",

      "bodyText": "What odds would Ladbrokes and Coral offer on their merger receiving a clean thumbs-up from the competition authorities? They would have to be extremely long to appeal. There are two problems. First, this bookmaking combination was blocked in 1998, deemed too damaging to punters. The duo might argue that the last century was another age and, up to a point, they\u2019d be right: the online revolution hadn\u2019t happened and Betfair hadn\u2019t matched its first bet. Yet the retail shops are hardly sideshows today. They still provide the bulk of the big boys\u2019 earnings and those irritating electronic roulette wheels yield solid cash flows. Ladbrokes has 25% of the UK\u2019s licensed shops and Coral 21%. William Hill has 27%, so a merger of the second- and third-largest players would see two companies account for 73% of the high street presence. That looks too much, whatever pleas are made about the inevitability of industry consolidation and punters\u2019 new ability to compare odds on their smartphones. Then there\u2019s the second factor, the form book of the Competition and Markets Authority. This body, strangely, is quarrelling over Poundland\u2019s purchase of 99p Stores. If the bar for problematic retail deals can be set that low, Ladbrokes/Coral surely would not slip under smoothly. Relevant questions, then, are: what disposals could be demanded, and would the deal still be worth doing? Impossible to say, of course. But a requirement to flog, say, several hundred leasehold premises in a hurry could create a serious financial obstacle. Still, you can\u2019t blame the new Ladbrokes chief executive, Jim Mullen, for thinking big and radically. The company, under his predecessor Richard Glynn and chairman Peter Erskine, has been so comprehensively thumped by William Hill in the online market over the past half-decade that the argument for acquiring greater muscle is strong. Coral has had similar stumbles online, even if progress is now being made. Indeed, the duo are only the fifth and sixth largest in the online market, a damning statistic. A merger with Ladbrokes might offer a better exit for Coral\u2019s private equity owners than a stock market flotation that would carry its own uncertainties. By way of encouragement, Ladbrokes\u2019 shares rose 15% as City analysts counted possible easy winnings from a merger. The first guesses were \u00a370m-ish, which should not be too demanding from a combined cost base of \u00a31.3bn. Yet this deal screams caution. In the parade ring, the numbers and thinking look promising. On the course, the competition remedies could prove too daunting. Mullen should keep his alternative mount, a self-help strategy for Ladbrokes, in full training. Bonus rules still fall short The principle is easy to understand: make bankers wait for their bonuses because bad bets can take years to turn sour and dodgy behaviour can take even longer to be revealed. The challenge is to design new bonus rules to fit the doctrine. In the hands of the Bank of England and the Financial Conduct Authority, the result is anything but simple. Top brass will have to wait seven years to get their prizes; for the managers one rung below, the deferral period will be five years; then it\u2019s three to five years on the rung below that. Then there are separate clawback periods in which already-paid bonuses can be returned in certain circumstances. These range from seven years to 10. What happens when a banker switches firms? Buyout awards, when the new employer picks up the tab for bonuses yet to be paid by the old employer, are a headache for regulators because so-called malus provisions are seemingly bypassed. Thus the Bank and FCA will \u201cexplore further\u201d ideas to allow buyouts to be clawed back. To be fair to the officials, they weren\u2019t aiming for complexity. They\u2019ve been obliged to be pragmatic. Traders, inevitably, have grumbled that a bonus isn\u2019t a real bonus if it has strings attached and can\u2019t be banked for years. That\u2019s the point, regulators might reply. The trouble is, bankers have clamoured for higher fixed salaries and often succeeded, thereby chipping away at the notion that rewards must be earned properly. In the circumstances, an imperfect fudge was on the cards. But the shortcomings are obvious. Rigging of foreign exchange markets was revealed only this year, but some of the dodgy deeds were committed in 2008. If future horrors also take seven years to come to light, deferring juniors\u2019 bonuses for three to five years is not a proper deterrent. Co-op flops can rest easy Long horizons are also required with the Co-operative Bank, where the same two regulators are limbering up. The bank, which almost collapsed two years ago, is braced for a fine, which is not a surprise. The intriguing part, though, is whether former directors will be sanctioned. Don\u2019t bet on it. Royal Bank of Scotland and HBOS were much bigger catastrophes for UK banking but have yielded the sum total of one action against a senior individual. Given that record of regulatory feeble-ness, the Co-op flops could probably consider themselves unlucky if any are singled out for dishonourable mention.",
