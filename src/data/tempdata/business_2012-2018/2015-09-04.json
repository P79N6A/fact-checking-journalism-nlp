      "bodyText": "In the mining town of Port Hedland, 1,500km north of Perth, modest prefabricated homes called fibro shacks, which were changing hands for more than A$1m four years ago, are now failing to find a buyer at a third of the price. Apartment blocks hurriedly tacked together by developers at the peak of the country\u2019s boom stand empty, because their promised supply of \u201cfly-in-fly-out\u201d mineworkers has dried up, along with the jobs they were brought in to do. In 2011, the iron ore-rich Pilbara region of north-west Australia was on the frontier of a 21st century gold rush, this time with iron ore as the main prize \u2013 driven by China\u2019s formidable appetite for natural resources to build up its infrastructure and modernise its economy. Pilbara boasted salaries two-thirds higher than the national average and almost 80% of workers were flown into their jobs from Australia\u2019s big cities. Now, mortgaged to the hilt on homes that lost value almost before the paint had dried, the mineworkers that remain are accepting longer hours and lower wages in an effort to keep up with the repayments. Their plight resonates thousands of miles away in Calgary, Canada. Oil, not iron ore, has been the foundation of that city\u2019s prosperity. But fears that China\u2019s appetite for natural resources is waning are sapping confidence; and as oil prices have plunged, another property boom could soon turn to bust. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of people here that have been losing their jobs from the energy sector,\u201d says Ann-Marie Lurie, chief economist at local estate agency CREB. Property prices have so far held up, but she says Calgarians are watching the global oil price with alarm. \u201cInto next year the real question becomes, how long are energy prices going to remain this low?\u201d she says, pointing out that, with building starts declining, the knock-on effects are already rippling through the construction industry. She expects house prices in Calgary, which rose by almost 10% in 2014, to go into reverse by the end of this year. Official figures showed last week that Canada\u2019s economy has now slipped into recession, having recorded two successive quarters of negative growth and confirming the weakness that the prime minister, Stephen Harper \u2013 who is fighting a tough re-election battle, has been reluctant to confront. Even after the official statistics were published, Harper insisted Canada was an island of stability amid the global economic turmoil, and refused to use the term recession. He says: \u201cI think it\u2019s more important to describe the reality of the situation, rather than to have labels.\u201d Herbert Emery, a professor of economics for the school of public policy at the University of Calgary says: \u201cPoliticians have been trying to keep us at ease to avoid a downturn in spending. The sensitivity is, now that this is official, it will make things worse.\u201d Like Australia, Canada weathered the financial crash of 2008 well, avoiding the banking crises suffered by the US, UK and the eurozone, instead growing fast on the back of exports of abundant natural resources. Indeed, the resilience of the Canadian economy in the face of the downturn contributed to the reputation of its central bank\u2019s then governor, Mark Carney, as the \u201crock star central banker\u201d, who was lured to London to run the Bank of England. But as the price of natural resources \u2013 including oil and iron ore \u2013 has dropped over the past twelve months, both countries have been hit hard. Their currencies have plunged, growth has slowed or ground to a halt and economists are warning that there may be worse to come. The experience of both countries is reminiscent of a syndrome economists call Dutch disease: the dark side of the riches that can flow from abundant natural resources. Whether it\u2019s coal or cocoa, iron ore or gold, when demand for natural resources is strong \u2013 as it has been through the long years of the Chinese economic miracle \u2013 workers, investment and political attention pour into extracting and exporting the precious stuff. The value of the currency tends to rise, as foreign buyers use it to pay for these valuable raw materials. Other potential export industries can be hollowed out, as they struggle to remain competitive against international rivals \u2014 Canada\u2019s manufacturing industry has faced mass job losses, for example. But commodities prices can be subject to violent changes - the oil price has more than halved since last summer, for example - and it is in the downswings when the resilience of resource-rich economies is seriously tested. The price of a barrel of oil has declined sharply, from $115 last summer, to less than $50 today. Iron ore prices have been declining since they peaked in 2011; and have halved over the past fifteen months. \u201cThe reality is that when the price of energy products drops, our economic activity drops,\u201d says Emery. Paul Dales, Australian economist at London-based consultancy Capital Economics, says: \u201cThe mining boom is over in Australia: it just rose on the back of China\u2019s coat-tails\u201d. He believes the country will eventually be well-placed to resume growth, as tourists and foreign students - not least from China - are attracted by the cheaper Australian dollar. Relatively healthy public finances, and a central bank with room to cut interest rates, as it did twice earlier this year, taking them to a record low of 2%, also mean the country has ammunition to tackle a slowdown. The depreciation in the Australian dollar is also helping. The governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia, Glenn Stevens, has repeatedly said he believes it was \u201cboth likely and necessary\u201d for the currency to decline. Nobel prize-winning economist Paul Krugman recently played down the risks to Australia of a Chinese downturn. He said: \u201cIt\u2019s not helpful to have the price of commodities that Australia exports go down \u2026 that said, Australia is a big, very diverse economy, it has other exports and it has a flexible exchange rate. \u201cSo if you look at what\u2019s happened in the past couple of years \u2013 certainly Australia has taken a hit from weakness in its exports but it has also had a major depreciation of the Australian dollar and that offset a lot of it.\u201d However, shifting an economy from one source of growth to another, in this instance from natural resource extraction to services exports, is rarely a smooth process. \u201cYou can\u2019t just switch off one engine and switch on another,\u201d says Dales. \u201cI think Australia might manage to avoid recession, but I do think it has a few years of relatively weak growth ahead of it.\u201d The most recent official figures showed growth of just 0.2% in the second quarter \u2013 half the rate expected by experts. And as the August turmoil in the world\u2019s financial markets made clear, there are fears that China may be set to experience a deeper and more damaging slowdown than Beijing has publicly acknowledged, which could have a profound impact on a whole string of countries that have built their growth model on China\u2019s rise. Even if a formal recession can be avoided in Australia, the human cost of the ending of what many market experts called the \u201ccommodities super-cycle\u201d, and the boom-times it brought with it, will be severe. Graduates who began their four-year degrees with the promise of work are now looking elsewhere. At the height of the boom, most mining specialists left university with an employment contract already signed. Now they\u2019re moving back in with their parents. \u201cIf you\u2019re a geologist grad, you might as well look for work in a coffee shop,\u201d one consultant to the mining industry said. \u201cYou\u2019re not going to get a job on a mine.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Back with Greece, and here\u2019s Reuters\u2019 take on the latest opinion poll showing Alexis Tsipras\u2019 Syriza party in second place to New Democracy: Greece\u2019s conservative New Democracy party has taken a tiny lead among voters over leftist Syriza before the September 20 election, an opinion poll published on Friday showed. New Democracy has rapidly closed the gap with Syriza in recent days, and the Metron Analysis poll on Friday was the second this week to show it overtaking former prime minister Alexis Tsipras\u2019s party. Syriza is on course to get 23.4% of the vote while New Democracy would take 24%, the latest poll showed. Over 11 percent of respondents were undecided. Just a few weeks ago, a Syriza victory in the snap election had appeared almost certain... The latest poll, conducted on behalf of the Parapolitika newspaper, showed New Democracy leader Evangelos Meimarakis, with his rating at 47%, was more popular than Tsipras, who was backed by 43%. On that note it\u2019s time to close up for now, so once again thanks for all your comments and we\u2019ll see you soon. Another volatile week finished with further woe for investors. Among the day\u2019s data, German factory orders fell 1.4% month on month in July, but the big event was the US non-farm payroll numbers. As it turned out the headline figure disappointed, with 173,000 jobs added in August compared with the 220,000 or so expected. But the unemployment rate dipped to 5.1% and hourly wages were steady, so there were few clues as to whether the US Federal Reserve would raise interest rates this month or not. Despite the turmoil caused by worries about China, many analysts believed there was nothing in the jobs data to prevent an increase. Equally, many others believed the Fed would keep its powder dry. The markets seemed to side with the hawks, especially since just before the figures were released, Richmond Fed president Jeffrey Lacker said the non-farm numbers should not derail the case for a rate rise. So the upshot was another slide in shares, with the final scores showing: The FTSE 100 finished down 151.18 points or 2.44% at 6042.92 Germany\u2019s Dax dropped 2.71% to 10,038.04 France\u2019s Cac closed 2.81% lower at 4523.08 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB fell 3.18% to 21,472.68 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended down 2.2% at 9821.8 The Athens market edge down 0.37% to 646.62 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently 292 points or 1.8% lower. Meanwhile Moody\u2019s has downgraded the senior debt ratings of four Greek banks to C, in the expectation that holders will suffer losses in the forthcoming recapitalisations. It said: The downgrade...primarily reflects Moody\u2019s expectation that junior and senior debt holders will be bailed in and sustain material losses as part of the upcoming recapitalisation process... Although Moody\u2019s expects uninsured depositors to be excluded from bail-in, as indicated by a recent Eurogroup statement, the negative outlook reflects the ratings agency\u2019s opinion that the recapitalisation process remains fluid and banks continue to face significant credit risks. The banks are Alpha Bank, Eurobank Ergasias, National Bank of Greece and Piraeus Bank. It may have been another volatile week but there is likely to be more to come. Tony Cross, market analyst at Trustnet Direct, said: Any hopes that markets may have been through the thick of the volatility have been squarely dashed today with a combination of risk mitigation ahead of the long weekend in the US and concern as to what the Fed is supposed to do with interest rates serving to knock sentiment in markets on a global basis. London has been left nursing triple digit gains and it\u2019s the commodity stocks that are bearing the brunt. The fact that the US jobless rate has fallen to its lowest level since 2008 has reopened the idea that the Federal Reserve could push through higher interest rates in two weeks time. This will further punish emerging markets currencies and make dollar denominated goods \u2013 like oil and metals \u2013 more expensive for many. There can be no doubting that the Fed has an enormous weight on its shoulders \u2013 calling this wrong could have wide-reaching effects. Next week may get off to a slow start with the US Labor Day holiday, but Chinese trade data on Tuesday will be closely watched. There\u2019s no argument that the world\u2019s second largest economy is slowing and that will affect the pace elsewhere, but the big question mark hangs over the speed of any contraction. Also on Monday the Chinese stock market is set to reopen after its closure due to the World War II remembrance events. With Chinese authorities seemingly hinting at no more intervention to stabilise the markets, it could prove another tricky session. The US Federal Reserve could raise rates faster and further than people expect, according to John Higgins of Capital Economics: Given the lack of a clear steer from [today\u2019s] report, we continue to think that the probability of US monetary policy being tightened later this month is around 50:50. The bigger picture, though, is that we still forecast that the Federal Open Market Committee will raise the federal funds rate further and faster over the next year or so than most expect, as a tightening labour market puts significant upward pressure on wage and core inflation. Indeed, the unemployment rate has already fallen to the mid-point (5.1%) of the \u201ccentral tendency\u201d of FOMC members\u2019 latest projections of its longer-run level. With this in mind, we think a big winner will be the dollar, as the contrast between the monetary policies of the Fed and other major central banks becomes increasingly stark. A big loser, though, could be Treasuries \u2013 even if term premiums remain low, there is plenty of scope for yields to rise as expectations for interest rates are revised up. Otherwise, while we anticipate that the US stock market will weather tighter monetary policy well, we think its upside will be capped by the squeeze on profit margins that results from diminishing slack in the labour market. Here\u2019s a couple of charts from the Bureau of Labour Statistics release: And here\u2019s the positive version of the jobs data from the President\u2019s twitter account: And this sums it up: The market slide is accelerating: Meanwhile over in Greece, a new poll ahead of this month\u2019s election and it\u2019s not good news for former prime minister Alexis Tsipras and his Syriza party: The jobs report muddies the monetary policy outlook, says Unicredit Research economist Harm Bandholz: Fed Vice Chair Stan Fischer said during his Jackson Hole speech that \u201cwe now await the results of the August employment survey.\u201d If he had hoped that the numbers will speak a clear language and basically make the decision for the FOMC \u2013 in the one or other direction \u2013 he will be disappointed... In our view, a generally risk-averse Federal Reserve does not want to risk to add to the uncertainty, and prefers to get a better sense of how the global headwinds might affect the US economy. To be sure, that view is far from being shared by all [Federal Reserve] members. Only today, Richmond Fed President Lacker reiterated his view that the US no longer requires zero interest rates \u2013 a view that we fundamentally share. And Mr. Lacker will certainly dissent at the upcoming meeting, if the Fed leaves its target rate unchanged But while the hawks are usually more vocal, they in our view do not have the majority to get the rate hike just yet. Other voting regional Fed presidents, such as Charles Evans and Dennis Lockhart, will probably be more than happy to stand pat for now. Finally, in a divided Committee, it is up to the Chair to forge the Consensus. And while Janet Yellen has not spoken in public about the policy outlook since mid-July (!), her approach so far has always been to err on the side of caution. As expected, US markets have fallen back in the wake of the mixed jobs data. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 204 points or 1.27% in the first few minutes of trading, while the S&amp;P 500 is 1.01% lower. Meanwhile G20 finance ministers and central bankers, currently meeting in Turkey, will not call on the US to delay a rate rise, Reuters is reporting: The U.S. Federal Reserve is coming under pressure from emerging markets not to raise rates too soon as turmoil in China threatens global growth, but the G20 will not publicly call for any delay, delegates meeting in Turkey said on Friday. Slower growth in China and rising market volatility have boosted the risks to the global economy, the International Monetary Fund warned ahead of the G20 meeting. It cited a mix of potential dangers such as depreciating emerging market currencies and tumbling commodity prices. Finance ministers and central bankers from the Group of 20 leading economies were pressing for more on China\u2019s plans to tackle its slowdown, delegates at the meeting in Ankara said. Emerging market economies are concerned that a U.S. rate hike on top of the Chinese turmoil would pile on extra pressure, they said... [But] a push by emerging market countries to characterise possible rate hikes in developed nations as a serious risk for the global economy was rejected by drafters of the G20 communique, a source from the Russian delegation said. \u201cSome emerging market countries wanted to fix a position,\u201d the source told reporters, when asked whether the Fed\u2019s expected rate hike would be mentioned in the communique... Another G20 source said the wording would probably not go beyond a general caution to central banks to bear in mind the consequences of policy shifts. \u201cThere will be no open demand to the Fed to act,\u201d the source told Reuters. For all those believing the jobs data makes a rate rise this month less likely, there are others believing the opposite: We warned earlier that a middling jobs report might not be good for markets. And it turns out we were right. Europe\u2019s stock markets are falling deeper into the red, knocking at least 2% off the main indices. Wall Street is expected to fall back when it opens in 10 minutes. Investors are still anxious, because there\u2019s still no clarity on whether the Fed will push the button on rate hikes. Nor is it any clearer whether the US economy is strong enough to take it. Marcus Bullus, trading director at MB Capital, says: \u201cIt has been a turbulent fortnight and this latest jobs data will not assuage market fears. The August figure is an unconvincing start to the Fall and will trigger even more concern in the markets about the state of the global economy.\u201d Here\u2019s the damage in Europe right now: Millennials are still struggling to break into the labor market: It may not feel like it, but the US economy has now achieved \u201cfull employment\u201d. So says Paul Ashworth of Capital Economics: The decline in the unemployment rate leaves it in line with the Fed\u2019s 5.0% to 5.2% estimate of the equilibrium long-run unemployment rate. In short, the Fed just achieved the full employment part of its dual mandate. Admittedly, the participation rate remained at a depressed 62.6% and that decline in the unemployment rate was partly due to a 41,000 decline in the labour force last month. But it was notable that the wider U6 measure of unemployment also fell again, to 10.3% from 10.4%. Ashworth also believes a September rate hike is 50:50 toss-up, given today\u2019s \u201cfairly mixed\u201d report. This is a particularly difficult Non-Farm Payroll to interpret, sighs Rob Carnell of ING. It\u2019s a \u201cvery mixed bag\u201d. And for that reason, he doesn\u2019t see the Fed raising rates this month: The August US labour report delivered something for everyone. But in the end, we don\u2019t think it is sufficiently strong enough for the Fed to proceed with a September rate hike without markets worrying that the data is not good enough to support it. For that, we think we needed to see less ambiguity in these numbers \u2013 e.g. a clear surge in payrolls to back up falls in the unemployment rate and rising wages. And this didn\u2019t happen. The FT\u2019s economics editor suggests Janet Yellen and colleagues shouldn\u2019t give today\u2019s Payroll much attention: Analysts aren\u2019t really sure what to make of this Non-Farm Payroll report. One the one hand, fewer jobs were created than expected, suggesting the jobs market is weakening. On the other, the unemployment rate continues to hit levels not seen since the financial crisis began, indicating ultra-loose monetary policy has done its job. Who\u2019d be a Fed policymaker, eh? At 62.6%, the US labor force participation rate is actually the joint-lowest rate since 1977. That helps explain how the unemployment rate has dropped so much -- as it doesn\u2019t include Americans who have dropped out the jobs market. There are still 8.0 million unemployed in America, the BLS says. That includes 2.2 million who have been unemployed for at least 27 weeks. And 6.5 million people were working part time for economic reasons in August. The full report is here. America\u2019s health care, social assistance and financial services firms all took on more staff last month, reports the Bureau for Labor Statistics. Manufacturing and mining firms shed jobs, though. The BLS also reports that the labor force participation rate was 62.6% in August for the third consecutive month. That means firms didn\u2019t manage to lure more people into the labor market. The \u2018underemployment rate\u2019, which measures whether people want to put in more hours, also dropped last month to 10.3% from 10.4%. US workers\u2019 hourly earnings beat expectations last month. They rose by 0.3% in August, to $25.01, which is a 2.2% gain on last year. Wall Street expected 2.1%. The Labor Department points out that August\u2019s initial non-farm payroll reading tends to be revised up in future months (as mentioned earlier) July\u2019s payroll has been revised up from 215,000 to 245,000, making up for some of August\u2019s shortfall. June has been revised up by 14,000. Here we go! 173,000 new jobs were created across the US economy last month, according to the Non-Farm Payroll. That\u2019s rather weaker than the 217,000 which economists expected. But June and July\u2019s figures have been revised higher (details to follow). And importantly -- the unemployment rate has fallen to its lowest level since March 2008, to just 5.1% from 5.3%. That\u2019s a bigger drop than Wall Street had pencilled in. More to follow.... Just one minute to go..... Could Jeffrey Lacker suspect that today\u2019s report will miss forecasts, so he\u2019s getting his rebuttal in early by arguing that it doesn\u2019t matter too much? Heads-up: Jeffrey Lacker, the president of the Richmond Fed, is arguing that today\u2019s non-farm payroll shouldn\u2019t derail the case for raising rates. In a speech in Richmond, Lacker, a hawkish Fed policymaker, says that a poor August report would be a \u201cone-month blip\u201d that shouldn\u2019t distract from the recent labour market recovery. Lacker says: \u201cI am not arguing that the economy is perfect, but nor is it on the ropes, requiring zero interest rates to get it back into the ring.\u201d Sounds like he\u2019ll vote to raise rates this month. The final, and most important, economic news of the week is going to be released in just 30 minutes time. The US employment report is published at 1.30pm BST, or 8.30am EDT, giving important new insight into the state of America\u2019s economy. People have a habit of getting too excited about the Non-Farm Payroll. But this one does matter. It will show how the world\u2019s largest economy is faring, at a time of global unease. And it will be a crucial factor in deciding if the Federal Reserve raises interest rates this month. The consensus is that around 217,00 new jobs were created last month. However, there\u2019s massive uncertainty around that figure, which is why stock markets are all still in the red. The unemployment rate is expected to drop again, from 5.3% to 5.2%. That would be fresh meat to the hawks on the Fed, who feel the economy doesn\u2019t need ultra-low interest rates. But other Fed policy makers will be watching the average hourly earnings figure. They are expected to show a rise of just 2.1% year-on-year; not a sign of a red-hot labour market that could drive inflation up. If we get a strong payroll, the chances of an early rate rise will surely increase. Ric Spooner, chief market analyst at CMC Markets in Sydney, says: Given that the Fed is comfortable with the broad trend of job growth, a strong number would improve the atmosphere for a September rate hike.\u201d And that might drive shares up; after all, a strong labour market means a solid economy. Shares could fall, though, if NFP is a bit weak. An increase of, say, 165,000 to 180,000 new jobs wouldn\u2019t end the uncertainty gripping the markets. As Chris Weston of IG put it: This is a grey area and the scenario I feel would actually prove to be the worst case for market participants. If you are an economist who has September or October pencilled in for Fed rate hikes then you probably wouldn\u2019t amend that view, but the growth in job creation is lacklustre and would provide the least amount of clarity. And we can\u2019t rule out a really bad number -- which would probably spook traders: Unfortunately, August is a notoriously unpredictable month where Non-Farm Payroll is concerned. The initial number is usually revised by around 80,000 jobs! More gloominess, this time from airline industry group IATA. It reports that the amount of freight shipped by air aroug the world fell by 0.6% in July, having risen by 1.2% in June. IATA Director General Tony Tyler warns that tough times are ahead, given the economic situation: \u201cThe combination of China\u2019s continued shift towards domestic markets, wider weakness in emerging markets, and slowing global trade indicates that it will continue to be a rough ride for air cargo in the months to come.\u201d The futures markets suggests US stocks will fall by around 1% when Wall Street opens in three hours time. However, the US jobs report comes an hour earlier, and will have a major impact on the markets. Although as explained earlier, we could get a \u2018middling\u2019 reading that doesn\u2019t give much clarity. The selloff in Europe is accelerating, pushing the FTSE 100 down by 101 points or 1.6%. Almost every share is down, led by retailers after it emerged August was the worst month for the sector since 2008: Worries over the global economy, China, and the upcoming US employment report are all weighing on the markets and wiping out Thursday\u2019s gains. Yesterday\u2019s rally, after the ECB suggested it could do more QE, looks rather overenthusiastic now. As Conner Campbell of SpreadEX puts it: It looks like the flip-flopping nature of markets is set to continue this Friday; after the Draghi-boosted highs on Thursday afternoon, the European indices seem to be in the midst of a harsh come-down this Friday morning, with all the major indices falling by over a percent. Germany\u2019s DAX is suffering even more, down 1.8%, as investors react to the worrying drop in German factory orders. The slump in German factory orders in July (see 8.03am) shows that the Chinese slowdown is hurting, say economists. Ulrike Kastens, economist at German private bank Sal. Oppenheim, said the fall in factory orders in July was \u201cdisappointing,\u201d though the \u201cmodest\u201d upward trend in German industry continues thanks to growth in recent months. While economic trends have improved within the eurozone, \u201cdevelopments in emerging markets, especially China, give cause for concern\u201d. \u201cThis will be a drag on German exports in coming months and will also dampen prospects for the world economy.\u201d Stefan Schilbe, economist at HSB Trinkaus, said domestic orders and from the rest of the eurozone had done well and falling oil prices should help. \u201cBut the main problem is what happens to global trade. Orders from the rest of the world fell by nearly 10%. There aren\u2019t enough growth drivers in the global economy. The USA looks solid, but many developing countries such as China, Brazil and Russia are under pressure. Countries that depend on raw materials like Canada and Australia are also struggling.\u201d (quotes via Reuters. Thanks to Julia Kollewe for the translations) The European Central Bank has shaken off its anxiety over the eurozone economy, and pressed on with installing a large artwork shaped like a tree outside its headquarters. No that\u2019s not a joke. See --&gt; Created by Italian artist Giuseppe Penone, it\u2019s called \u201cGravity and Growth\u201d -- (neatly encompassing the gravity of Europe\u2019s growth problem). It\u2019s made of bronze and granite, and a staggering 17 metres tall. And how much has this little enterprise set us back? There\u2019s no price tag on the tree, but the total competition to find three new artworks to brighten up the ECB HQ cost \u20ac1.25m! Money better spent on a project to tackle eurozone unemployment, or the refugee crisis, perhaps. The G20 will also resist blasting Beijing over the turbulence caused by its recent devaluation of the yuan, according to CNBC\u2019s Steve Sedgwick. There are four challenges facing finance chiefs at their G20 meeting, Luxembourg finance minister Pierre Gramegna tells Bloomberg TV. He\u2019s hoping for a \u201cfrank and open\u201d discussions on these points: The likely increase of US interest rates. \u201cIt\u2019s not a secret, it\u2019s going to happen.\u201d Eurozone QE, with Mario Draghi pledging yesterday to do more if needed. The financial turmoil in China. The low commodity prices, especially oil, which is posing a lot of problems for emerging countries. On China, Gramegna pointed out that China is still aiming for 7% growth this year, despite the slowdown in its manufacturing sector. That would be an \u201coutstanding result\u201d, compared to Europe. But on the financial side, Gramegna warns that it\u2019s \u201cvery difficult\u201d to go against the market. As we may see on Monday, when the Shanghai index reopens.... The prospect of a US interest rate hike is worrying top finance ministers and central bankers as they gather in Ankara for the G20 meeting. A draft communique, seen by Bloomberg, warns that: In line with the improving economic outlook, monetary policy tightening is more likely in some advanced economies, which may remain one of the main sources of uncertainty in financial markets. However, the G20 meeting isn\u2019t expected to lobby the Federal Reserve not to raise borrowing costs; it would, after all, be a sign of normalisation returning to the world economy. Look who\u2019s back! Yanis Varoufakis, the former Greek finance minister, has just told CNBC that he won\u2019t back Syriza\u2019s Alexis Tsipras in the general election on September 20th. That disagreement is Tsipras\u2019s decision to accept the tough conditions attached to Greece\u2019s third bailout, rather than exiting the eurozone. Varoufakis also declared that the political situation in Greece is toxic, with the country \u201con the foundations of an economy that\u2019s imploding\u201d. Six months of brinksmanship and fruitless negotiations, leading to the introduction of capital controls, didn\u2019t exactly help, of course.... So much for the Draghi rally. Europe\u2019s stock markets are sliding back as trading gets underway. In the City, the FTSE 100 quickly shed 80 points, led by retailers Next and Dixons Carphone (both down 3% after a broker downgrade) and then BP (down 2.7% as the oil price slides again) This follows a late selloff on Wall Street, showing nervousness ahead of today\u2019s US jobs report. Tony Cross, market analyst at Trustnet Direct, says: A fair chunk of yesterday\u2019s gains have been wiped off London\u2019s FTSE-100 index in the first few minutes of trade this morning with selling in the latter part of yesterday\u2019s Wall Street session clearly taking a toll on sentiment. Traders are now looking at screens awash with red numbers and even if today\u2019s non-farm payrolls are seen as having no meaningful implications in driving a September rate hike, the Fed still has time to act before the year is out. Yesterday\u2019s nascent rebound for commodity prices is also looking to be rather short lived \u2013 crude oil is slumping once again and as a result it\u2019s little surprise that the natural resources stocks have been shunted towards the foot of the index. John Lewis, that barometer of UK high street spending, has reported that sales at its department stores slid by 3.4% year-on-year in the last week of August. Not a great signal. It admitted that \u201ca tough trading period closed with another difficult week\u201d, but is pinning its hopes on targeting \u201cpent-up demand\u201d in September. We also have fresh signs of weakness in Europe\u2019s powerhouse economy this morning. German factory orders shrank by 1.4% in July, according to new data from the Economy Ministry. That\u2019s a big reversal on June\u2019s 1.8% rise in orders. It\u2019s a volatile measure, so caution is needed. But it reinforces Mario Draghi\u2019s point yesterday - Europe\u2019s economy isn\u2019t too rosy. A fresh bout of gloom swept Japan\u2019s trading floor today, pushing the Nikkei index down by 2% to a fresh seven-month low. The selloff appears to have been triggered by renewed worries over the state of the global economy, after Mario Draghi warned yesterday that eurozone growth has slowed. Tokyo traders also weren\u2019t impressed by the latest Japanese wage data, which showed real earnings rose just 0.3%. That\u2019s not enough to get Japan\u2019s economy roaring. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Today is all about the US jobs report, and the possibility that the long run of record low interest rates is about to end. Investors are hunkering down ahead of the Non-Farm Payroll, released at 1.30pm BST (8.30am EDT). It will show how many new jobs were created in August. A strong reading could persuade the Federal Reserve to raise borrowing costs soon, perhaps this month, especially if it is accompanied by a decent rise in wages. A poor NFP could kick the first rate hike into 2016. A middling report, though, will leave investors baffled about when the Fed will act, at a time when the global economy is looking weaker. The Wall Street consensus is that the NFP will rise by 218,000, but as usual there\u2019s wide variation, so it could be lively day. Especially as Federal Reserve policy maker Jeffrey Lacker will give a speech just before the Non-Farm payroll is released, called \u201cthe case against further delay\u201d...... European stock markets are expected to slide by at least 1% this morning, having jumped yesterday after European Central Bank chief Mario Draghi hinted at more stimulus measures. Asian markets have already dipped, even though the Chinese bourses are shut until Monday. We\u2019ll also be tracking reaction to yesterday\u2019s ECB press conference, and monitoring events in Turkey as G20 finance ministers and central bank chiefs meet.",

Among the day\u2019s data, German factory orders fell 1.4% month on month in July, but the big event was the US non-farm payroll numbers. As it turned out the headline figure disappointed, with 173,000 jobs added in August compared with the 220,000 or so expected. But the unemployment rate dipped to 5.1% and hourly wages were steady, so there were few clues as to whether the US Federal Reserve would raise interest rates this month or not.</p> <p>Despite the turmoil caused by worries about China, many analysts believed there was nothing in the jobs data to prevent an increase. Equally, many others believed the Fed would keep its powder dry. The markets seemed to side with the hawks, especially since just before the figures were released, Richmond Fed president Jeffrey Lacker said the non-farm numbers should not derail the case for a rate rise.</p> <p>So the upshot was another slide in shares, with the final scores showing:</p> <ul> <li><strong>The FTSE 100 finished down 151.18 points or 2.44% at 6042.92</strong></li> <li><strong>Germany\u2019s Dax dropped 2.71% to 10,038.04</strong></li> <li><strong>France\u2019s Cac closed 2.81% lower at 4523.08</strong></li> <li><strong>Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB fell 3.18% to 21,472.68</strong></li> <li><strong>Spain\u2019s Ibex ended down 2.2% at 9821.8</strong></li> <li><strong>The Athens market edge down 0.37% to 646.62</strong></li> </ul> <p>On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently 292 points or 1.8% lower.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-55e9be23e4b04ff2821ddbd6\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2015-09-04T15:58:52.726Z\">4.58pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Meanwhile Moody\u2019s has downgraded the senior debt ratings of four Greek banks to C, in the expectation that holders will suffer losses in the forthcoming recapitalisations</strong>.

Tony Cross, market analyst at Trustnet Direct, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Any hopes that markets may have been through the thick of the volatility have been squarely dashed today with a combination of risk mitigation ahead of the long weekend in the US and concern as to what the Fed is supposed to do with interest rates serving to knock sentiment in markets on a global basis. London has been left nursing triple digit gains and it\u2019s the commodity stocks that are bearing the brunt.</p> <p>The fact that the US jobless rate has fallen to its lowest level since 2008 has reopened the idea that the Federal Reserve could push through higher interest rates in two weeks time. This will further punish emerging markets currencies and make dollar denominated goods \u2013 like oil and metals \u2013 more expensive for many.

The bigger picture, though, is that we still forecast that the Federal Open Market Committee will raise the federal funds rate further and faster over the next year or so than most expect, as a tightening labour market puts significant upward pressure on wage and core inflation. Indeed, the unemployment rate has already fallen to the mid-point (5.1%) of the \u201ccentral tendency\u201d of FOMC members\u2019 latest projections of its longer-run level.</p> <p> With this in mind, we think a big winner will be the dollar, as the contrast between the monetary policies of the Fed and other major central banks becomes increasingly stark. A big loser, though, could be Treasuries \u2013 even if term premiums remain low, there is plenty of scope for yields to rise as expectations for interest rates are revised up. Otherwise, while we anticipate that the US stock market will weather tighter monetary policy well, we think its upside will be capped by the squeeze on profit margins that results from diminishing slack in the labour market.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2015-09-04T15:14:47.199Z\">at 4.14pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-55e9b268e4b09849138e8394\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2015-09-04T15:04:25.879Z\">4.04pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Here\u2019s a couple of charts from the Bureau of Labour Statistics release:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"72090756c62fcc8e35105a6525041a26d10573d9\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/9/4/1441379001229/00217e01-2b4b-4897-90ee-1fb2724d8d50-bestSizeAvailable.png\" alt=\"US unemployment rate\" width=\"353\" height=\"219\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">US unemployment rate.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bureau of Labour Statistics</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f4737ee53ffc966ae07db71905e311e94fd082a9\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/9/4/1441379060302/55a2cb75-8c66-4df1-8a10-7496319c4a70-bestSizeAvailable.png\" alt=\"Non farm payrolls - number of jobs added\" width=\"366\" height=\"213\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Non farm payrolls - number of jobs added.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bureau of Labour Statistics</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-55e9ac49e4b04ff2821ddb69\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2015-09-04T14:36:20.910Z\">3.36pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>And here\u2019s the positive version of the jobs data from the President\u2019s twitter account:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/BarackObama/statuses/639806230110842881\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">The economy added 173,000 jobs in August\u2014a record-breaking 66 consecutive months of private-sector job growth.</p>&mdash;

      "bodyText": "Poor weather in August might have dampened high street clothes sales but it seems to have triggered a stampede into car showrooms with a near-10% increase in monthly vehicle sales. The Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) said new car registrations rose by 9.6% year-on-year to 79,060 vehicles with the Ford Fiesta, Ford Focus and Volkswagen Golf models leading the way. It extended the record run of rising sales to a 42nd month and brought the number of new registrations for the year so far to 1.6m, with industry officials predicting more growth to come. There was also very strong demand for \u201calternatively-fuelled vehicles\u201d which include plug-in hybrids and pure electric cars. Sales were up by 52% although this type of car still only represents 2.4% of the overall market. There was an even bigger jump in sales of commercial vehicles such as vans and lorries, with registrations increasing by 15% to 17,350, all of this at a time when the European and global markets are quite flat. \u201cAugust\u2019s strong performance has again been driven by attractive finance deals and a diverse range of technologically advanced models,\u201d said Mike Hawes, chief executive of the SMMT. \u201cBritain\u2019s budget-conscious buyers are taking advantage of low regular monthly payments that provide certainty and affordability.\u200e\u201d The SMMT has previously said it expects full-year new car sales to rise nearly 4% compared with last year. In the first eight months of the year, sales were up by 6.7% but the increases are expected to taper off in the new year. Some of the sales growth over the three and a half years has come because motorists held off from buying such big-ticket items for a long period following the financial crash of 2008. But much has also come from businesses buying either individual cars or whole batches of vehicles. Last month there was a 12% rise in fleet sales and a 12% rise in business transactions. David Raistrick, a manufacturing expert at the consultancy Deloitte, said the overall growth in sales was ahead of expectations. \u201cAugust registrations have now exceeded the levels achieved in 2007 (77,000). This level has not been reached in the intervening years, even with the assistance of the government scrappage scheme in 2009.\u201d It has also provided a fillip for Britain\u2019s strong motor manufacturing industry. Earlier this week Nissan announced plans to invest a further \u00a3100m in its Sunderland plant to build the next generation of its Juke crossover car. The decision will guarantee 6,700 jobs at the plant and support a further 27,000 positions in the supply chain, the Japanese company said. Experts said it justified government support over 20 years for foreign investors establishing plants in this country. In March, Honda revealed plans to inject \u00a3200m into its factory in Swindon, while the London Taxi Company said it would create 1,000 new jobs with \u00a3250m of spending on ultra low-emission taxis. The Ford Fiesta was the top-selling car in August (4,753), followed by the Ford Focus (2,673), VW Golf (2,456), Vauxhall Corsa (2,154) and VW Polo (1,911).",

      "bodyText": "AstraZeneca received a much-needed boost when its blood-thinning drug, Brilinta, a potential blockbuster, was approved by the US health regulator for wider use. The Food and Drug Administration approved Brilinta tablets for longer-term use in patients with a history of heart attack. The new 60mg dose can be taken twice a day along with aspirin beyond a year after a heart attack. Until now, the blood thinner could only be prescribed for one year after a heart attack, as a 90mg dose. Brilinta is one of the big earners AstraZeneca is counting on to offset falling sales from older bestsellers as they come off patent, such as Nexium and Crestor. Brilinta has had a bumpy ride since being launched in 2011 but the AstraZeneca boss, Pascal Soriot, has talked it up as a diamond in the rough. The British drugmaker is also preparing to present data on its lung cancer medicines, another key part of its portfolio, at a conference in Denver, Colorado, which begins this weekend. AZD9291, one of its most promising new drugs, will be the focus of six presentations. It targets a genetic mutation that helps tumours evade current lung cancer pills. Antoine Yver, head of oncology in global medicines development at AstraZeneca, said: \u201cAZD9291 is moving through clinical development with unprecedented speed, and was recently granted US priority review designation.\u201d The FDA move comes just days after the European Society of Cardiology endorsed the longer-term use of Brilinta and other blood clot preventers. A decision from European regulators is expected in the first six months of next year. Marc Sabatine, the lead investigator in Boston for a large clinical study involving more than 21,000 patients, said it showed that the use of Brilinta together with aspirin in patients who had suffered a heart attack significantly reduced the risk of dying from cardiovascular causes, having another attack or a stroke in the long term. The FDA decision will boost sales of the heart drug, which is used to prevent blood clots that can cause heart attacks, strokes and deaths. AstraZeneca has estimated that annual sales could reach $3.5bn (\u00a32.29bn) by 2023 and a spokeswoman said the expanded label for Brilinta reinforces the company\u2019s confidence in that forecast. Brilinta sales rose 23% to $144m in the second quarter, and totalled $476m last year. There is now no time limit on how long Brilinta can be taken, which means patients could stay on it indefinitely. But doctors will have to weigh Brilinta\u2019s benefits against risks of bleeding. Deutsche Bank analysts Richard Parkes and Sarah Potter said: \u201cIn theory, extended use of Brilinta could double the addressable patient population for the drug. In reality, we believe the increased bleeding risks and modest net benefit is likely to limit extended duration therapy to selected patients with low risk of bleeding complications and particularly high cardiovascular risk. They added: \u201cGiven that 20% of current generic Plavix use is believed to be in patients on extended therapy, this still represents a significant growth opportunity.\u201d Rival blood thinner Plavix, made by Bristol-Myers Squibb, has come off patent and so cheaper generic versions of it are available. The new Brilinta 60mg tablet is expected to be in US pharmacies by the end of this month.",

    "webTitle": "The road to recovery: furloughs, layoffs and job numbers that shade the truth", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The unemployment rate fell to a seven-and-a-half-year low in August. While the number of new jobs created was less than expected, overall the month-to-month numbers have been positive, allowing the Obama administration to tout economic recovery and the Fed to prepare for a potential interest rate hike later this year. Yet, the monthly numbers do not tell the entire story. As certain industries have been adding jobs to keep the unemployment rate steady, others industries like oil and gas have been slashing them by hundreds and thousands. Some workers have been let go with a promise of a job weeks or months down the road. Not fired, just furloughed \u2013 but no paycheck feels the same, no matter what you call it. Other workers, in retail and local government, have also been furloughed, with hours shaved from their weekly and monthly schedules. The low unemployment rate provides little comfort to these workers. Irene Coleman worked at her last job, as an HR generalist, for about three months before she was furloughed on 9 July. \u201cThey didn\u2019t give us any notice,\u201d Coleman said. \u201cI did go on unemployment briefly but they called me back two weeks later.\u201d This week, however, was Coleman\u2019s last week with the company. \u201cI just gave notice and will begin a new job next week,\u201d said the 61-year-old from Panorama City, California. Initially, when the two-week long furlough started, Coleman had no plan to look for a new job. \u201cBut I had a feeling this company is just too unstable; therefore, I sought other employment,\u201d she said. Coleman is not the only one to be called back to work from a weeks-long furlough. Mid-May of this year, Blue Bell ice cream company announced that 1,400 of its employees were going to be placed on a partially paid furlough. \u201cThey were paid a substantial portion of their pay, with the expectation that they would return to work when needed,\u201d a company spokesperson told the Guardian. \u201cAt this time, we\u2019ve brought back approximately 360 furloughed workers. We will continue to bring back more workers in phases as production and distribution expands.\u201d One of those workers was Sean Cooper, who told his local CBS station that he was grateful because he could have been laid off. While he was furloughed, Blue Bell paid him for 30 hours\u2019 work each week, which while helpful was less than he was used to. To make ends meet in the meantime, he found a part-time job at a local resale shop. \u201c[The part-time job] has allowed me to get back to living a normal life,\u201d he said. \u201cIt pays the bills. It helps me and my family to survive.\u201d Blue Bell hoped to bring back more workers in the coming week, but has no specific dates as of yet. \u201cWe are happy to be bringing back more and more furloughed employees, and look forward to the day that all of our furloughed employees are back working at Blue Bell,\u201d the spokesperson told the Guardian. Blue Bell is not the only firm whose employees have been looking for new jobs this summer, either temporary or permanent. Brenham, Texas \u2013 where Blue Bell closed one of its factories and laid off 250 workers, in addition to the 300 it had furloughed \u2013 saw 160 people laid off by agricultural equipment manufacturer Valmont Industries, 64 by machining manufacturer MIC Group, and 47 by Stanpac, which handled Blue Bell\u2019s packaging. Texas also has seen jobs disappear in the oil and gas sector, a trend across the entire country. Over the past year, the number of unemployed workers in mining, quarrying and oil and gas extraction more than doubled, reaching 79,000 in July. That\u2019s up from 34,000 last July. During that same period, the unemployment rate in the sector climber to 8.1%, up from 3% a year ago. According to Swift, which tracks layoffs in oil and gas industry, 176,162 jobs were lost globally in the field this year. Continental Resources, an Oklahoma oil company that track layoffs, found the US has cut at least 91,000 jobs in the energy industry since last summer. Jamie Dandar, chapter president of Oilfield Helping Hands\u2019 Rocky Mountain chapter, which covers Colorado, Wyoming and Utah, said they have seen an uptick in oil field families in need of assistance, having encountered a financial crisis through no fault of their own, said Dandar. \u201cEvery one of our board members was affected by layoffs,\u201d she said. \u201cThe last downturn we had was in 2008. It\u2019s cyclical. I know some of the people who have been in the business for a long time, they have gone through this before. It\u2019s the nature of a commodity, prices of which fluctuate. It will go down for a while and then it will invariably come up. Nobody really has the crystal ball to say when that will happen. But we know that it will.\u201d The increase in layoffs have come at the time when crude oil prices in US have hit their lowest point since 2009. Slowdown in the energy sector has affected other sectors as well \u2013 such as railroads and freight train operators. In July, Union Pacific railroad CEO Lance Fritz said 1,200 workers had been furloughed and that the number was expected to grow as the company entered into third quarter. \u201cThe slowdown in coal right now is being driven by a couple of things,\u201d he told Bloomberg. \u201cFirst is we came into this year with a pretty big inventories at the utility plants. Natural gas prices are clearly driving more of electricity production than natural gas and the weather was not all that good in the second quarter for coal burn.\u201d Not even a month later, Union Pacific announced that in the coming months the company would have to eliminate several hundred management jobs. Long-term furloughs, which can last months and during which workers go without pay, \u201care a more like a layoff\u201d, according to Elise Gould, senior economist at the Economic Policy Institute. \u201cFurloughs would then have an impact on local economy that layoffs would have on a local economy \u2013 it\u2019s no different,\u201d she said. \u201cPeople lost their income, therefore they don\u2019t have money to spend.\u201d Those who actively look for other jobs while furloughed might be counted as unemployed, but Gould said they could also be counted as simply out of the labor force for that period. Traditionally, when people think about furloughs, they think of employees\u2019 schedules being cut by \u201ca day here or there\u201d, she explained. \u201cIn that case, if it\u2019s a day here or there \u2013 \u2018Oh, we don\u2019t have enough work for you today, come back tomorrow\u2019 or \u2018Don\u2019t come back tomorrow, come back the next day\u2019 \u2013 that\u2019s different from layoffs. It\u2019s not for a long period of time.\u201d Such furloughs will go into effect in Jackson, Mississippi, in October and are scheduled to last for two years. City workers will be furloughed the last Friday of each month and docked eight hours\u2019 pay from their checks. \u201cWe are facing one of the toughest budget seasons our city has experienced but the furlough will prevent layoffs and major reductions in city services,\u201d Jackson mayor Tony Yarber said in a statement. According to Gould, furloughs are similar to what is known in the retail industry as just-in-time employment. For example, Walmart, which earlier this year increased pay for half a million of its workers, has recently reduced hours for a number of its employees. In retail, \u201cit\u2019s not called a furlough. It\u2019s just called scheduling \u2013 putting less people on the schedule,\u201d explained Gould. \u201cFor people, who don\u2019t get their schedule till the same day or just a couple days before, employers implicitly schedule them for fewer hours or schedule them more in Christmas time.\u201d The people for whom furloughs mean working a day less a week or a month \u2013 like the city employees in Jackson or a store cashier whose hours have been reduced \u2013are counted as employed, explained Gould. As such, these type of furloughs do not affect the unemployment rate. \u201cThey are counted as employed in both of the major government surveys: the payroll survey, because they would have been on payroll for that period even if it was for less hours, fewer days; and the household survey. Did you work in this period? Yes, but you didn\u2019t work as much as you should\u2019ve. You might show up in hours, but you are not going to show up in unemployed [numbers].\u201d If a furlough or schedule adjustment doesn\u2019t show up on the unemployment report, did it happen?",

While the number of new jobs created was less than expected, overall the month-to-month numbers have been positive, allowing the Obama administration to tout economic recovery and the Fed to prepare for a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/aug/29/federal-reserve-stanley-fischer-rate-increase-inflation\">potential interest rate hike</a> later this year. </p> <p>Yet, the monthly numbers do not tell the entire story.</p> <p>As certain industries have been adding jobs to keep the unemployment rate steady, others industries like oil and gas have been slashing them by hundreds and thousands. Some workers have been let go with a promise of a job weeks or months down the road. Not fired, just furloughed \u2013 but no paycheck feels the same, no matter what you call it. Other workers, in retail and local government, have also been furloughed, with hours shaved from their weekly and monthly schedules. </p> <p>The low unemployment rate provides little comfort to these workers. <br></p> <p>Irene Coleman worked at her last job, as an HR generalist, for about three months before she was furloughed on 9 July. \u201cThey didn\u2019t give us any notice,\u201d Coleman said. \u201cI did go on unemployment briefly but they called me back two weeks later.\u201d</p> <p>This week, however, was Coleman\u2019s last week with the company. \u201cI just gave notice and will begin a new job next week,\u201d said the 61-year-old from Panorama City, California. </p> <p>Initially, when the two-week long furlough started, Coleman had no plan to look for a new job. \u201cBut I had a feeling this company is just too unstable; therefore, I sought other employment,\u201d she said. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"22b91e3db0d8316a0199491d6620550c70779d67\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/22b91e3db0d8316a0199491d6620550c70779d67/293_443_5222_3133/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Blue Bell personnel Freddie Hugo, Rickey Seilheimer and Charlie Franke stock freezers with Blue Bell products.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">In May, Blue Bell announced that personnel such as these three men would be placed on a partially paid furlough.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Steve Gonzales/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Coleman is not the only one to be called back to work from a weeks-long furlough. Mid-May of this year, Blue Bell ice cream company announced that 1,400 of its employees were going to be placed on a partially paid furlough. </p> <p>\u201cThey were paid a substantial portion of their pay, with the expectation that they would return to work when needed,\u201d a company spokesperson told the Guardian. \u201cAt this time, we\u2019ve brought back approximately 360 furloughed workers. We will continue to bring back more workers in phases as production and distribution expands.\u201d </p> <p>One of those workers was Sean Cooper, <a href=\"http://dfw.cbslocal.com/2015/08/31/blue-bells-hometown-return-brought-relief-to-employees-residents/\">who told his local CBS station</a> that he was grateful because he could have been laid off. While he was furloughed, Blue Bell paid him for 30 hours\u2019 work each week, which while helpful was less than he was used to. </p> <p>To make ends meet in the meantime, he found a part-time job at a local resale shop. </p> <p>\u201c[The part-time job] has allowed me to get back to living a normal life,\u201d he said. \u201cIt pays the bills. It helps me and my family to survive.\u201d </p> <p>Blue Bell hoped to bring back more workers in the coming week, but has no specific dates as of yet.</p> <p>\u201cWe are happy to be bringing back more and more furloughed employees, and look forward to the day that all of our furloughed employees are back working at Blue Bell,\u201d the spokesperson told the Guardian. </p> <p>Blue Bell is not the only firm whose employees have been looking for new jobs this summer, either temporary or permanent. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/jul/30/shell-to-cut-6500-jobs-due-to-continuing-oil-price-slump\">Shell cuts 6,500 jobs as oil price slump continues</a> </p> </aside>  <p><a href=\"http://www.houstonchronicle.com/news/houston-texas/houston/article/In-Brenham-layoffs-continue-and-the-unemployed-6293156.php\">Brenham, Texas</a> \u2013 where Blue Bell closed one of its factories and laid off 250 workers, in addition to the 300 it had furloughed \u2013 saw 160 people laid off by agricultural equipment manufacturer Valmont Industries, 64 by machining manufacturer MIC Group, and 47 by Stanpac, which handled Blue Bell\u2019s packaging. </p> <p>Texas also has seen jobs disappear in the oil and gas sector, a trend across the entire country. Over the past year, the number of unemployed workers in mining, quarrying and oil and gas extraction more than doubled, <a href=\"http://www.bls.gov/news.release/archives/empsit_08072015.pdf\">reaching 79,000 in July</a>. That\u2019s up from 34,000 last July. During that same period, the unemployment rate in the sector climber to 8.1%, up from 3% a year ago. </p> <p>According to Swift, which tracks layoffs in oil and gas industry, 176,162 jobs were lost globally in the field this year. Continental Resources, an Oklahoma oil company that track layoffs, found the US has cut <a href=\"http://www.houstonchronicle.com/business/energy/article/Rising-layoffs-stun-worry-oil-industry-workers-6460142.php?t=5aab14cd2e\">at least 91,000 jobs in the energy industry</a> since last summer.</p> <p>Jamie Dandar, chapter president of <a href=\"http://www.oilfieldhelpinghands.org/what-we-do/\">Oilfield Helping Hands\u2019 Rocky Mountain chapter</a>, which covers Colorado, Wyoming and Utah, said they have seen an uptick in oil field families in need of assistance, having encountered a financial crisis through no fault of their own, said Dandar. </p> <p>\u201cEvery one of our board members was affected by layoffs,\u201d she said. </p> <p>\u201cThe last downturn we had was in 2008. It\u2019s cyclical. I know some of the people who have been in the business for a long time, they have gone through this before. It\u2019s the nature of a commodity, prices of which fluctuate. It will go down for a while and then it will invariably come up. Nobody really has the crystal ball to say when that will happen. But we know that it will.\u201d </p> <p>The increase in layoffs have come at the time when crude oil prices in US have hit <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/aug/21/us-crude-oil-prices-lowest-since-2009-jobs\">their lowest point since 2009</a>. </p> <p>Slowdown in the energy sector has affected other sectors as well \u2013 such as railroads and freight train operators. In July, Union Pacific railroad CEO Lance Fritz said 1,200 workers had been furloughed and that the number was expected to grow as the company entered into third quarter. </p> <p>\u201cThe slowdown in coal right now is being driven by a couple of things,\u201d <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/videos/2015-07-23/union-pacific-has-furloughed-more-than-1200-workers-ceo\">he told Bloomberg</a>. \u201cFirst is we came into this year with a pretty big inventories at the utility plants. Natural gas prices are clearly driving more of electricity production than natural gas and the weather was not all that good in the second quarter for coal burn.\u201d </p> <p>Not even a month later, Union Pacific announced that in the coming months the company would have to eliminate <a href=\"http://www.omaha.com/money/union-pacific-to-cut-several-hundred-management-jobs-in-omaha/article_3a1de250-413e-11e5-8e3d-87bb56d2f5ec.html\">several hundred management jobs</a>. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4edaf3e3ebff6242c785610b88905a9aed021c82\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4edaf3e3ebff6242c785610b88905a9aed021c82/0_180_3000_1801/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Oil rigs drilling in McKenzie County in western North Dakota\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Throughout the year, employers pulled back on hiring and a slowdown in oil and gas drilling caused big job losses in some states.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Matthew Brown/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Long-term furloughs, which can last months and during which workers go without pay, \u201care a more like a layoff\u201d, <a href=\"http://www.epi.org/people/elise-gould/\">according to Elise Gould</a>, senior economist at the Economic Policy Institute. </p> <p>\u201cFurloughs would then have an impact on local economy that layoffs would have on a local economy \u2013 it\u2019s no different,\u201d she said. \u201cPeople lost their income, therefore they don\u2019t have money to spend.\u201d</p> <p>Those who actively look for other jobs while furloughed might be counted as unemployed, but Gould said they could also be counted as simply out of the labor force for that period. </p> <p>Traditionally, when people think about furloughs, they think of employees\u2019 schedules being cut by \u201ca day here or there\u201d, she explained. </p> <p>\u201cIn that case, if it\u2019s a day here or there \u2013 \u2018Oh, we don\u2019t have enough work for you today, come back tomorrow\u2019 or \u2018Don\u2019t come back tomorrow, come back the next day\u2019 \u2013 that\u2019s different from layoffs. It\u2019s not for a long period of time.\u201d </p> <p>Such furloughs will go into effect in Jackson, Mississippi, in October and are scheduled to last for two years. City workers will be furloughed the last Friday of each month and docked eight hours\u2019 pay from their checks.</p> <p>\u201cWe are facing one of the toughest budget seasons our city has experienced but the furlough will prevent layoffs and major reductions in city services,\u201d <a href=\"http://www.wapt.com/news/central-mississippi/jackson/jackson-city-employees-furloughs/34603618\">Jackson mayor Tony Yarber said in a statement</a>. </p> <p>According to Gould, furloughs are similar to what is known in the retail industry as just-in-time employment. For example, Walmart, which earlier this year <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/feb/19/walmart-to-raise-wages-half-a-million-workers\">increased pay for half a million of its workers</a>, has recently <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-08-31/wal-mart-cuts-some-workers-hours-after-pay-raise-boosts-costs\">reduced hours for a number of its employees</a>. </p> <p>In retail, \u201cit\u2019s not called a furlough. It\u2019s just called scheduling \u2013 putting less people on the schedule,\u201d explained Gould. \u201cFor people, who don\u2019t get their schedule till the same day or just a couple days before, employers implicitly schedule them for fewer hours or schedule them more in Christmas time.\u201d</p> <p>The people for whom furloughs mean working a day less a week or a month \u2013 like the city employees in Jackson or a store cashier whose hours have been reduced \u2013are counted as employed, explained Gould. As such, these type of furloughs do not affect the unemployment rate.</p> <p>\u201cThey are counted as employed in both of the major government surveys: the payroll survey, because they would have been on payroll for that period even if it was for less hours, fewer days; and the household survey. Did you work in this period? Yes, but you didn\u2019t work as much as you should\u2019ve. You might show up in hours, but you are not going to show up in unemployed [numbers].\u201d </p> <p>If a furlough or schedule adjustment doesn\u2019t show up on the unemployment report, did it happen?</p>",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The US economy added 173,000 jobs in August, less than expected, while the unemployment rate dropped to 5.1%, surpassing expectations. The numbers released by the Department of Labor on Friday are likely to complicate matters for the Federal Reserve, which meets later this month and will discuss raising interest rates for the first time since the recession. This is the last jobs report before the Fed meeting. Economists had expected the non-farm payroll figures to increase by 220,000 jobs and the unemployment rate to reach a seven-and-a-half-year low of 5.2% in August. The 5.1% unemployment rate is the lowest since March 2008. \u201cThe headline number is a little softer than what we were expecting, but I think the overall report is quite good,\u201d Gus Faucher, senior economist at PNC, said. \u201cTraditionally the August reporting is really a bit soft, but then you have good upward revisions over the next couple of months and so I would not be surprised at all to see that this time around. That\u2019s one reason why you need to look past the headline number.\u201d A Reuters analysis found that August employment reports between 2005 and 2014 often underestimated jobs growth initially and were revised up by on average 58,000 jobs in the next month\u2019s report. \u201cThe Fed is well aware of that and so they are going to take that into account when they look at the August number and say that we would not be surprised to see some upward revisions to job growth in August,\u201d said Faucher. \u201cEven with these August numbers, the job growth over the last three months has still been 221,000 which is above the level that we need to keep up with growth in the labor force so it\u2019s quite good.\u201d Both June and July\u2019s jobs numbers were revised up. June\u2019s job growth was revised from 231,000 jobs created to 245,000 and July\u2019s from 215,00o to 245,000, a combined total of 44,000 more jobs. Additionally, the increase in wages was higher than Wall Street expected at 0.3%. Over the year, wages have grown by 2.2%. \u201cWages are the unfinished business of this recovery,\u201d said Chris Lu, US deputy labor secretary. According to Lu, Friday\u2019s jobs report continues to show a steady job growth. He pointed out that there have been 66 months of consecutive job creation. \u201cIt\u2019s the longest streak on record,\u201d he said. However, in addition to lower-than-expected job growth, Friday\u2019s report found the US labor force participation rate remained steady at 62.6%. The percentage of people in the workforce has not been this low since 1977. The figure suggests long-term unemployed Americans are still skeptical of the US labor market and have yet to rejoin the labor force and look for work. An increase below 200,000 jobs comes as the Fed is also considering the impact on the US economy over continued anxiety about the weakening Chinese economy. Worries over China and rising rates have caused panic on global stock markets. In August, the Dow Jones Industrial Average had its worst month in three years. The DJIA had gone on to plunge 2.8% on Tuesday, then rallied early on Thursday only to drop again by the end of the day with investors remaining cautious about the jobs report. A week ago, while speaking at an annual conference in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, the Fed vice-chairman, Stanley Fischer, said that \u201cthe door is definitely open\u201d to an interest rate increase in September. However, in an interview with CNBC, he added that \u201cthe change in circumstances which began with the Chinese devaluation is relatively new and we are still watching how it unfolds\u201d. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t want to go ahead and decide right now what the case is,\u201d he said. Friday\u2019s job report settles little about the Fed\u2019s decision, leaving the next two weeks \u201cessentially as unsettled as they were prior to the report\u2019s release\u201d, according to Dan Greenhaus, chief strategist at BTIG research. \u201cWe doubt this report meaningfully changes the Fed\u2019s outlook on a September rate hike. While the headline figure was less than expected, revisions mitigate that miss while the other parts of the report, specifically the unemployment rate drop and earnings increase, will be welcomed by the Fed,\u201d he explained. \u201cIf one was inclined to believe the Fed would not hike in September, the headline miss works in your favor. If one felt the opposite, the drop in the unemployment rate along with a rebound in earnings works in your favor.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "August turned out to be the worst month for Britain\u2019s retailers since the financial crisis of 2008, a survey has shown, as poor weather and a spike in foreign holidays kept shoppers away from the high street. Retail sales fell by 4.3% on the year before, according to the monthly high street sales tracker from accountancy firm BDO. This was the biggest drop since November 2008 and the sixth monthly fall this year. The John Lewis department store chain, seen as a barometer of the high street, reported a 3% drop in August sales year on year. Sales were down 3.4% in the latest week to 29 August. Fashion sales slipped 0.9%, electricals and home technology suffered a 9.3% fall and homewares were down 0.4%. Paula Nickolds, buying and brand director at John Lewis, said: \u201cA tough trading period closed with another difficult week, but with definite signs in the run-up to the bank holiday weekend that there is plenty of pent-up demand for us to target in September.\u201d Cantor Fitzgerald analyst Freddie George noted this was a key week for the sector, before children go back to school and when consumers start to shop for their autumn wardrobes. \u201cThese figures are thus in our view very disappointing probably impacted by consumers, particularly those based in the south, choosing to take holidays.\u201d The figures come a day after the closely watched monthly Markit survey showed Britain\u2019s dominant services sector growing at its slowest rate for two years in August, pointing to slower economic growth in the third quarter. BDO said all retail sectors disappointed in August, with fashion sales down 5.5%, homewares falling by 3.3% and lifestyle goods slipping by 1.3%. While non-store sales rose by 11.4% year on year, this was the slowest growth ever recorded for online sales by BDO. Sophie Michael, the head of retail and wholesale at BDO, said: \u201cThe high street was losing out as UK consumers opted to spend their disposable income on leisure pursuits, eating out and holidays. The strength of the pound has encouraged Brits to spend more abroad rather than in the UK.\u201d Earlier this week, car parts and bicycle retailer Halfords blamed the wet weather in August for a sharp fall in sales. Fashion chain Next was the biggest loser on the FTSE 100 index in early trading, while Dixons Carphone was also among the main fallers after Exane BNP Paribas cut its target price on the shares. The investment bank also downgraded Marks &amp; Spencer and Argos owner Home Retail Group.",

      "bodyText": "Australia is resilient enough to weather the weakening of the Chinese economy, the Nobel prize-winning economist Paul Krugman has said, but he poured cold water on the benefits of the free trade agreement between the two countries. Speaking to Guardian Australia ahead of the Festival of Dangerous Ideas in Sydney, Krugman, a renowned columnist at the New York Times, predicted the slowing Chinese economy would hurt Australia, but said the country should not get \u201ctoo hysterical\u201d about it. \u201cIt\u2019s not helpful to have the price of commodities that Australia exports go down \u2026 that said, Australia is a big, very diverse economy, it has other exports and it has a flexible exchange rate. So if you look at what\u2019s happened in the past couple of years \u2013 certainly Australia has taken a hit from weakness in its exports but it has also had a major depreciation of the Australian dollar and that offset a lot of it. \u201cThese kind of adverse shocks of exports always hurt, but its only catastrophic if either you have no recourse \u2013 so if [for example] you\u2019ve give up your own currency then you\u2019re in trouble, and if you\u2019re very vulnerable financially \u2013 if you\u2019re very heavily indebted in foreign currency then you\u2019re vulnerable. But last I looked Australia has neither of those characteristics.\u201d Krugman added: \u201cI think in the end you\u2019re likely to see what is going on now in China is something like what happened with the Asian financial crisis. And Australia was extremely successful at riding out that storm and maybe you\u2019re not as good this time, but I think that you don\u2019t want to get hysterical about this. \u201cAustralia, like Canada, is a country that has the wrong exports and is kind of in the wrong place in the world right now, but has a lot of other strengths.\u201d Krugman supports free trade, but was sceptical of the benefits of bilateral agreements such as the one between China and Australia. They were often misleadingly pitched as something that must be done \u201cfor the national good\u201d, he said. \u201cIt isn\u2019t really \u2013 it\u2019s not going to have any major impact on GDP per capita.\u201d He suggested the Australia-China deal could well be, like the Trans Pacific Partnership, mostly about entrenching the power of monopolies. \u201cFree trade \u2013which on the whole I\u2019m a supporter of \u2013 is being used to cover fields that really are not about that at all.\u201d Krugman also opposed the TPP currently being negotiated, of which Australia\u2019s trade minister, Andrew Robb, is an ardent advocate. It was \u201cnot really a trade agreement\u201d, Krugman said, as trade in the Pacific area was \u201calready pretty free in most things\u201d. Rather, he argued the TPP was mostly about \u201cintellectual property rights and dispute settlements procedures\u201d, for which there were \u201cvery clear negative argument that it hurts consumers\u201d. \u201cIf Australia is having problems with selling stuff to the rest of the world it has a pretty straightforward answer, namely it\u2019s got a floating currency. The Aussie dollar goes down and pretty much takes care of itself, so Australia really doesn\u2019t need to worry about that. \u201cAnd maybe Australia should be doing better in some industries than it is maybe there should be some policy [on that] but the idea that the economy is likely to suffer from some generalised problem with competitiveness is just wrong.\u201d He did not go as far as his fellow Nobel winner Joseph Stiglitz, who wrote in the Guardian this year that the TPP was an attempt by corporate interests to bypass democratic institutions to dictate terms on matters largely unconcerned with trade. Krugman, who won the Nobel prize in economics in 2008, will speak on Saturday at the Sydney Opera House about bad ideas that won\u2019t go away. Such ideas, he said, were \u201ceasily demonstrated to be wrong\u201d and \u201crefuted by experience\u201d, but \u201clike zombies, they refuse to die no matter how many times you think they should have been killed\u201d. One such idea was the belief that in the face of \u201cmass unemployment, severe economic distress and record low interest rates, public debt was the biggest problem we faced\u201d. Krugman acknowledged many politicians like to talk about the national debt as if it were a household budget. But he said: \u201cIt would be a very foolish business leader who never accept a debt, because it might sometimes be a good idea to borrow at time when funds are cheap and there are good uses for the money. So how come we don\u2019t use that analogy rather than the household analogy?\u201d The recent solid growth of the US and UK economies was achieved despite rather than because of the austerity programs they pursued to cut debt, Krugman said. The upturn largely came when the programs were halted. \u201cIf you repeatedly and gratuitously hit yourself in the head and then stop, you\u2019ll start to feel better again,\u201d he said. \u201cThat sounds silly, but that\u2019s really the story of the UK.\u201d The desire for austerity and to reduce government debt, he argued, came about when people treated the economy like \u201csome sort of morality play\u201d in which they believed that if \u201cthere is a depression it must be because someone is doing something wrong, and trying to bail them out with government deficits must somehow just make things worse\u201d. Krugman was also sceptical of the need for Australia to cut income taxes and shift towards greater reliance on consumption taxes such as the GST, as proposed by the federal treasurer, Joe Hockey. \u201cThere is essentially zero evidence that this is an important concern in practice,\u201d he said. Nor was there evidence to suggest that \u201ctax rates on personal incomes cause major incentive problems\u201d. Talk of \u201ceconomic reform\u201d was often \u201ccode for comforting the comfortable and afflicting the afflicted\u201d, he said. \u201cStructural reform\u201d in particular was a phrase used to justify \u201csome political points of view that actually aren\u2019t at all grounded in evidence or logic\u201d, he said. Asked about suggestions that prospective Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders might ask him to be secretary of the Treasury should he be elected, Krugman laughed, saying: \u201cIf you had ever seen one of my work offices you\u2019d know why I should never be running any organisation.\u201d",
