      "bodyText": "Beppe Grillo, the comedian-turned-rebel leader of Italian politics, must have laughed heartily. No sooner had he announced to supporters that the euro was \u201ca total disaster\u201d than the currency union was driven to the brink of catastrophe once again. Grillo launched a campaign in Rome last weekend for a 1 million-strong petition against the euro, saying: \u201cWe have to leave the euro as soon as possible and defend the sovereignty of the Italian people from the European Central Bank.\u201d Hours later markets slumped on news that the 18-member eurozone was probably heading for recession. And there was worse to come. Greece, the trigger for the 2010 euro crisis, saw its borrowing rates soar, putting it back on the \u201cat-risk register\u201d. Investors, already digesting reports of slowing global growth, were also spooked by reports that a row in Brussels over spending caps on France and Italy had turned nasty. With China\u2019s growth rate continuing to slow, and US data showing the world\u2019s largest economy was not as immune to the turmoil as many believed, it was time to head for the hills. Wall Street slumped and a month of falls saw the FTSE 100 lose 11% of its value. In the wake of the 2008 global financial crisis, voters backed austerity and the euro in expectation of a debt-reducing recovery. But as many Keynesian economists warned, this has proved impossible. More than five years later, there are now plenty of voters willing to call time on the experiment, Grillo among them. And there seems to be no end to austerity-driven low growth in sight. The increasingly hard line taken by Berlin over the need for further reforms in debtor nations such as Greece and Italy \u2013 by which it means wage cuts \u2013 has worked to turn a recovery into a near recession. Angela Merkel and her finance minister Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble are shaping up to fight all comers over maintaining the 3% budget deficit limit and already-agreed austerity measures. Even if France and Italy find a fudge to bypass the deficit rule, they will be prevented from embarking on the Marshall Plan each believes is needed to turn their economies around. Hollande wants a EU-wide \u20ac300bn stimulus to boost investment and jobs \u2013 something that is unlikely to ever get off the ground. So can we look forward to further turmoil on Wall Street and the stock exchanges of Europe and Asia? It seems as though there will be a rally, if only because the US has shown its economy is broadly growing. But can the US economy carry the world on its shoulders? No must be the answer. Several of Asia\u2019s formerly tigerish economies are suffering with debt overhangs. China has found that pumping out steel and building endless apartments in unlikely places is not real economic activity and incurs huge debts. Investors worry about these debts. Japan looked like it might come to the rescue after a multibillion-dollar pump-priming exercise by the central bank boosted growth. Yet even that has run out of steam. So a rally is likely to be short-lived. Volatility is here to stay. The only answer comes from central bankers, who propose pumping more funds into the financial system to bring down the cost of credit and encourage lending and, hopefully, sustainable growth. James Bullard, an influential member of the US Federal Reserve, said as much last week. Andy Haldane, the chief economist at the Bank of England, said he was gloomier now than at any time this year. He expects interest rates to stay low until at least next summer. It\u2019s not a plan with much oomph. Most economists believe the impact of central bank money is waning. Yet without growth and the hope of well-paid jobs for young people, parents across the EU who previously feared for their savings following a euro exit appear ready to consider the potential benefits of a break-up. There is a Grillo in almost every eurozone nation. Now that would bring real volatility. We can\u2019t handle the banks\u2019 pay dodges John Lanchester\u2019s book on the language of finance, How to Speak Money, laments how \u201cclosed and excluding\u201d the lexicon of the City can be. This phenomenon is damaging for citizens \u2013 from the consequences of mis-selling to incomprehension of iniquitous economic policy \u2013 and for governments who find themselves on the hook when financial institutions hoodwink politicians and regulators with sophistry. The British banking industry has been attempting to throw another bucket of obfuscation over the financial glossary with its claim that a new pay measure called a \u201crole-based allowance\u201d is not a bonus. UK banks claim that allowances \u2014 which have given an extra \u00a31.7m a year to HSBC boss Stuart Gulliver and nearly \u00a31m to his Lloyds and Barclays counterparts \u2013 constitute fixed pay and are not variable, or linked to performance. They are therefore not bonuses, they claim, and do not represent a breach of the European Union bonus cap that limits such payments to a maximum of two times salary. Last week the European Banking Authority ruled that the allowances were indeed variable and therefore constituted a bonus. UK banks, backed by the government, will ignore the ruling. But if an overarching implication of the EBA\u2019s finding holds firm \u2013 that banks can no longer get away with semantic chicanery \u2013 then it will be a step towards a safer and more honest financial system. By veiling an act in disingenuous terms, banks are trying to drag their methods back into the darkness, where they can behave with the sort of impunity that triggered the credit crunch. Lanchester\u2019s book opens with a well-worn but apposite quote from the Aaron Sorkin film A Few Good Men. When it comes to economics, Lanchester says, governments are like the Jack Nicholson character in that film: \u201cYou want the truth? You can\u2019t handle the truth!\u201d Banks are the same, and in the wake of the EBA\u2019s ruling a more honest approach by the industry must follow. Big week for Tesco A big week looms for new Tesco boss Dave Lewis, who gets his first public outing on Thursday, unveiling half-year profits expected to be a pitiful \u00a3800m. Last year it made \u00a31.4bn, which was already down 23% on 2012. A year ago the shares stood at 358p; on Friday they were just 174p. We should also get the full, gruesome details of the retailer\u2019s \u00a3250m accounting scandal. Lewis must outline how he intends to restore Tesco\u2019s fortunes and his plans for the vital Christmas trading period. He must also convince investors he is the man for the job. They will probably give him time, money and a free hand to rebuild the brand, but eventual success is not a slam dunk. The grocery world is changing faster than Tesco can. Marks &amp; Spencer never regained its dominance after it lost its way, and it would be wrong to assume Tesco\u2019s problems will pass.",

That\u2019s a pretty healthy backdrop.\u201d</p> <p>But healthy as that backdrop may seem, he feels it has deteriorated since he took the chief economist job in June. Never far away from reaching for an analogy, sporting or otherwise, Haldane used an image back in June from his beloved cricket (he used to class himself a fast bowler growing up in Yorkshire), suggesting that policymakers needed to be \u201con the front foot\u201d and prepared to raise rates sooner.

Friday\u2019s dovish remarks were what pushed economists at investment bank JP Morgan to revise their interest rate forecast. They now see the first rate rise coming in the second quarter of next year rather than the first. JP Morgan economist Allan Monks explained: \u201cHaldane\u2019s views have been close to the centre ground on the committee so far. He is one of the MPC\u2019s heavyweights, as well as chief economist, and hence we put significant weight on his comments.\u201d</p> <p>So what has changed in Haldane\u2019s opinion? Plenty. Markets had been a little slow to take in the picture of weaker global growth, heightened geopolitical and financial risks and benign inflationary pressures.</p> <p>\u201cWhat we have seen over the past week is financial markets catching up with the data. Possibly overreacting to the data but certainly catching up, because I think there has been a drip drip drip \u2013 globally I mean \u2013 of slightly below-par news for several months.\u201d</p> <p>He feels market players are right to push back the chances of a rate rise to later in 2015. This is a big change from the summer, when some were talking about a move as soon as November.</p> <p>\u201cThe data can move things around quite a lot... They have, and it has been in one direction,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Haldane is also concerned, however, with how those outside the financial markets are supposed to interpret such mixed headlines. The Bank, he said, was also grappling with the question of why it is that growth is strong, unemployment is falling and inflation is low \u2013 yet many people are worse off than at the start of the financial crisis.</p> <p>Haldane concedes that this divergent picture poses challenges for monetary policy, with some parts of the economy \u201cgoing gangbusters\u201d while there is \u201ccontinuing pain\u201d for others.</p> <p>\u201cYou can only set the average interest rate,\u201d he said. \u201cBut does that mean the Bank of England is entirely impotent? No.\u201d It can use other tools, such as changing the rules on mortgage lending, as it did earlier this year.</p> <p>This is where Haldane sees his team of economists as crucial: the Bank needs to better understand both the economy and the potential consequences of any policy moves.</p> <p>He is upfront about the way the MPC has, along with other forecasters, been consistently over-optimistic for years. But he vows that will change. \u201cWe can\u2019t afford not to have the best model that economists can develop and we are going to do that. It will happen,\u201d he said.</p> <p>The new chief economist wants to see a new way of forecasting that is \u201cmore granular\u201d. That means less reliance on averages and more questions over what is happening to different sectors and income groups.</p> <p>His describes his dream as a <em>Star Trek</em> scenario where a Captain Kirk of global financial systems sat at a dashboard with the ultimate spread of data at their fingertips. It exists for weather and the internet, so why not the global economy, he asked. \u201cThe absence of that global financial weather map has never been more harmful.\u201d</p> <p>With the weather turning, and cold winds from east and west, it is little wonder Haldane feels the job of an economist is the toughest it has ever been. But he is happy to be living in interesting times. \u201cI have been lucky to have 25 years of doing it. It\u2019s been absolutely brilliant, but the challenges have never been greater than now.\u201d</p>",

Haldane concedes that this divergent picture poses challenges for monetary policy, with some parts of the economy \u201cgoing gangbusters\u201d while there is \u201ccontinuing pain\u201d for others. \u201cYou can only set the average interest rate,\u201d he said. \u201cBut does that mean the Bank of England is entirely impotent? No.\u201d It can use other tools, such as changing the rules on mortgage lending, as it did earlier this year. This is where Haldane sees his team of economists as crucial: the Bank needs to better understand both the economy and the potential consequences of any policy moves. He is upfront about the way the MPC has, along with other forecasters, been consistently over-optimistic for years. But he vows that will change. \u201cWe can\u2019t afford not to have the best model that economists can develop and we are going to do that. It will happen,\u201d he said. The new chief economist wants to see a new way of forecasting that is \u201cmore granular\u201d. That means less reliance on averages and more questions over what is happening to different sectors and income groups. His describes his dream as a Star Trek scenario where a Captain Kirk of global financial systems sat at a dashboard with the ultimate spread of data at their fingertips. It exists for weather and the internet, so why not the global economy, he asked. \u201cThe absence of that global financial weather map has never been more harmful.\u201d With the weather turning, and cold winds from east and west, it is little wonder Haldane feels the job of an economist is the toughest it has ever been. But he is happy to be living in interesting times. \u201cI have been lucky to have 25 years of doing it. It\u2019s been absolutely brilliant, but the challenges have never been greater than now.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "During a week of turmoil on the global stock markets, the energy sector played out a drama that could have even bigger consequences: a standoff between the US and the Opec oil-producing nations. While pension holders and investors watched aghast as billions of pounds were lost to market gyrations, a fossil-fuel glut and a slowing global economy have driven the oil price down to a level that could save the world $1.8bn a day on fuel costs. If this is some consolation for households everywhere after last week\u2019s hit on stock market wealth, it means pain for the Opec cartel, composed mainly of Middle East producers. Opec\u2019s 12-member group has largely controlled the global price of crude oil for the past 40 years, but the US\u2019s discovery of shale oil and gas has dramatically shifted the balance of power, to the apparent benefit of consumers and the discomfort of petrostates from Venezuela to Russia. The price of oil has plummeted by more than a quarter since June but will Opec, which holds 60% of the world\u2019s reserves and 30% of supplies, cut its own production to try to lift prices? Or will the cartel allow a further slide from the current price \u2013 in the mid-$80s per barrel \u2013 in the hope of making it impossible for US drillers to make a profit from their wells, and so driving them out of business? Saudi Arabia \u2013 Opec powerhouse and traditional ally of Washington \u2013 and other rich Gulf nations have been building up their cash reserves and have shown themselves willing to slash prices in a bid to retain market share in China and the rest of Asia. The US, the world\u2019s biggest oil consumer, has relied in the past on Saudi to keep Opec price rises relatively low. But now it has the complicating factor of protecting its own huge shale industry. Even US oil producers see the political benefits of abundant shale resources and the resultant downward pressure on prices. Rex Tillerson, chief executive of Exxon Mobil, the biggest US oil company, said recently that his country had now entered a \u201cnew era of energy abundance\u201d \u2013 meaning it is no longer dependent on the politically unstable Middle East. So there will be understandable tension next month when the ruling Opec body meets in Vienna and its member states fight over what to do. The cartel would like to reassert its authority over oil prices but some producing countries, such as Saudi, can withstand lower crude values for much longer than others, and the relative costs of production vary wildly between nations. Since the Arab spring, many countries in the Middle East have hugely increased their public spending in response to growing dissent over unemployment and high prices. A lower oil price endangers this. Bijan Zanganeh, the Iranian energy minister, has already put in a plea for a production cut: limiting supply would raise prices and increase national income from fossil fuels. He knows that his country\u2019s higher-than-average production costs, plus an economy undermined by years of sanctions, mean it would come off badly in any oil war with the US. Venezuela and Angola are also known to be keen for the cartel to push prices up again with production cuts. In Vienna, Opec delegates will debate the merits of reducing production quotas for member states in an attempt to drive up the international oil price, or keeping prices low in a game of chicken with the US that could force cutbacks in the shale lands of Texas and Pennsylvania. Recent history offers an incentive for Opec brinkmanship. In 2012, a slump in the price of US natural gas led to major changes. Exploration and production companies had rushed into shale gas drilling, only to be forced into a huge retreat when the ensuing fossil-fuel glut saw prices fall from $11 per million British thermal units in 2008 to below $3. Even the largest oil companies, such as Exxon Mobil and Shell, were badly burned by their shale gas assets plunging in value. While Opec wrestles with its internal politics, the US president is mulling a gambit of his own. Barack Obama is now considering whether to lift the restriction on crude exports imposed in the 1970s, a move that could put further pressure on Opec producers by lowering prices but also turn the screws on Russia, which is in Washington\u2019s bad books over Ukraine. One of the many conspiracy theories currently doing the rounds over the oil price suggests the US and Saudi Arabia are acting in concert in a bid to hurt Iran and Russia. Deutsche Bank analysts have claimed that US oil output stands to be undermined as long as the price is under $90 a barrel. But Ed Morse, global head of commodities research at Citigroup, disagrees. \u201cProduction is getting less costly every year and break-even costs are plummeting to much lower levels than commonly believed, certainly lower than $75,\u201d he argued in a blog. Over recent years drilling has been going on in US national parks, back gardens and even underneath aircraft runways, and local production is at its highest in 30 years. The latest survey from global oil services company Baker Hughes reports that the number of oil rigs in North America has reached its highest ever, at just over 1,600. But it is not just the enormous increase in US production over the past couple of years \u2013 it grew by 15% in 2013 alone \u2013 that has caused the glut. It is not just more supply that has tipped the balance. The world is seeing much lower than anticipated demand for fossil fuels because countries from Europe to Asia are struggling to return to the economic growth levels of the pre-crash era. And moreover many countries, Britain, Germany and Japan among them, have also been working hard to reduce their demand for oil by becoming more energy efficient. Meanwhile traders have also started to unwind the effects of the geopolitical risk that was attached to oil amid fears that Islamic State advances in Syria and Iraq could lead to supply disruption in the wider Middle East. Concern that the standoff between the west and Russia over the Ukraine could lead Vladimir Putin to restrict oil and gas exports to Europe has also subsided. But Russia is at risk itself in this low-price environment, because half of the state\u2019s revenues come from oil and gas. The Moscow stock market has dropped by more than 20% since the summer and the rouble has fallen by a similar amount this year against the dollar. Russia\u2019s central bank is said to be working on a shock scenario of oil prices hitting $60. It is no wonder, therefore, that market sentiment towards oil has changed. There has been an wholesale rewriting of price forecasts across Wall Street and the City of London. Credit Suisse has reduced its forecast for Brent to $93 for 2016 and $88 for 2017. This compares with a price of oil which averaged $111 in both 2011 and 2012 and which only dipped to $108 last year. A continued trough around the current level of mid-$80 would hurt the producing countries but clearly help the consuming nations. This is the flipside to last week\u2019s stock market rout. Citigroup\u2019s Morse believes if oil prices remain low it will act as a \u201chuge quantitative easing programme which would help to spur sputtering economic growth\u201d. The decline in prices would generate a $1.8bn daily windfall for the global population in lower fuel costs, or some $660bn annualised, he argues. \u201cTracking this into gasoline prices in the US, where last year some $2,900 per household was spent on gasoline, the windfall would amount to a tax rebate of just under $600 per household.\u201d The reduction in oil prices has already pushed down petrol prices in Britain and helped reduce costs for farmers. There has been a 14% fall in UK wholesale gas prices, which is partly linked to global oil prices, although this has yet to be translated into household bills. Peter Atherton, a utilities analyst with stockbroker Liberum Capital, says it is now possible to predict that wholesale power prices in Britain will rise from around \u00a350 per megawatt hour to around \u00a357 by 2020, which is considerably less than many had feared. After that, he says, a series of government interventions aimed at supporting the building of new gas-fired power stations, windfarms and nuclear plants will push prices up as the costs are passed on to households. These low-carbon initiatives \u2013 which are partly aimed at beating climate change, but also billed as a hedge against rising fossil-fuel costs \u2013 could cause trouble for governments in the future. \u201cIf the rest of the world is enjoying cheaper energy costs, will the British public be willing to foot 20% to 40% higher bills? Maybe the climate change argument will be enough but maybe it won\u2019t,\u201d Atherton asks. Some industry experts do indeed believe that, far from hovering around the $110 seen in recent years, the oil price has moved into a new phase of being priced closer to \u2013 or even lower than \u2013 $80. But Ann-Louise Hittle, head of macro oils research at consultant Wood Mackenzie, disagrees. She believes too many governments in countries dependent on oil and gas revenues have too much to lose from a long-term price slump. \u201cWe do not think oil prices can remain well below $90 per barrel for this reason,\u201d she says. But Nick Butler, a former BP executive and an energy adviser to Gordon Brown, is not sure anyone has much control over volatile crude markets any more. \u201cOnce started, a price fall is going to be very hard to reverse,\u201d he says. \u201cMuch of Saudi Arabia\u2019s power is psychological \u2013 people have believed that because they have controlled prices in the past they will do so for ever.\u201d Oil price winners and losers Oil prices have an effect across the UK economy. Lower prices have started to drive down petrol costs \u2013 cutting the business costs as well as consumer bills \u2013 and reduced the price of wholesale gas and electricity. UK inflation has already been pushed down by falling energy prices and this should also reduce food costs, as fuel is a significant element in food production. But it is not all good news: lower crude values will also reduce the profitability of the North Sea and cut tax revenues. Much depends on how long prices stay low. Here are the winners and losers so far. Consumers It is no surprise the supermarkets have started a price war on the petrol forecourts. Sainsbury\u2019s, Asda and Tesco have all slashed pump prices: some now charge 126.7p a litre for diesel and 123.7p for unleaded petrol. In spring 2012, motorists were paying more than 137p for unleaded, and this put enormous pressure on George Osborne to scrap planned fuel duty rises. Much of the cost at the pump is tax, but further falls in the oil price should bring more relief to drivers \u2013 while possibly increasing car miles and carbon emissions. Energy suppliers are resisting passing on the lower wholesale gas and electricity prices, citing a possible price freeze by a Labour government next spring. If wholesale costs remain low \u2013 gas is down 14% \u2013 the big six suppliers will be forced to act. Industry The price of fuel is not only a pain for consumers; it hurts farmers, airlines and manufacturing. September\u2019s fall in inflation \u2013 to its lowest level in five years at 1.2% \u2013 is partly a consequence of lower energy, food and transport prices. Transport is a major part of agricultural costs, and supermarkets spend a fortune trucking goods around the country. Airlines are acutely vulnerable to oil-price rises and should be able to reduce fares if lower energy costs persist. Falling energy prices may ease some of the pressure the government is under from energy-intensive industries such as cement and steel, which often complain they are uncompetitive against countries such as the US, where the shale gas boom has driven down energy costs. Armed forces The biggest single user of fuel in the world is said to be the US army, so lower fuel costs in theory could mean more military manoeuvres by America. But its current number one adversary, Russia, derives more than half of its revenue from oil and gas, and its economy could be driven into recession by a prolonged reduction in commodity costs. Oil and gas prices are linked in many of the world\u2019s biggest contracts. The Kremlin\u2019s military intervention in Ukraine has made Europe more aware of its dependence for its energy security on Russian gas exports, but this is less of a worry if Moscow\u2019s economic power is weakened. Scotland The economic power of Scotland is diminished at times of low oil prices. The Scottish National Party based much of its economic model for independence on extracting a further 24bn barrels of crude, but that presumed a global price of $100 a barrel. Now it is under $90 and some say it will fall further. Alex Salmond was hoping to raise $1.5tn of tax revenues, but lower oil prices would reduce that. The North Sea is already a high-cost domain and it will become of less interest to oil explorers than lower-cost regions where huge discoveries could still be made. Power generation The past high price of wholesale gas and the relatively low price of electricity have led to many gas-fired power stations being closed or mothballed, but although falling gas prices have helped generators, they will need to fall further for many of those plants to break even. Cheaper gas also undermines the competitiveness of other forms of power generation such as wind and nuclear. A period of low gas prices could make subsidies for new reactors at Hinkley Point in Somerset and new wind farms and solar arrays look even more toxic. Lower gas and oil prices should reduce investor interest in UK shale-gas fracking, which would delight environmentalists but disappoint the government and industry supporters. But overall, lower fossil fuel prices - oil, gas and coal - will weaken the hand of those arguing for a low-carbon economy.",

Transport is a major part of agricultural costs, and supermarkets spend a fortune trucking goods around the country. Airlines are acutely vulnerable to oil-price rises and should be able to reduce fares if lower energy costs persist. Falling energy prices may ease some of the pressure the government is under from energy-intensive industries such as cement and steel, which often complain they are uncompetitive against countries such as the US, where the shale gas boom has driven down energy costs.</p> <p><strong>Armed forces </strong> The biggest single user of fuel in the world is said to be the US army, so lower fuel costs in theory could mean more military manoeuvres by America. But its current number one adversary, Russia, derives more than half of its revenue from oil and gas, and its economy could be driven into recession by a prolonged reduction in commodity costs. Oil and gas prices are linked in many of the world\u2019s biggest contracts. The Kremlin\u2019s military intervention in Ukraine has made Europe more aware of its dependence for its energy security on Russian gas exports, but this is less of a worry if Moscow\u2019s economic power is weakened.</p> <p><strong>Scotland </strong>The economic power of Scotland is diminished at times of low oil prices. The Scottish National Party based much of its economic model for independence on extracting a further 24bn barrels of crude, but that presumed a global price of $100 a barrel. Now it is under $90 and some say it will fall further. Alex Salmond was hoping to raise $1.5tn of tax revenues, but lower oil prices would reduce that. The North Sea is already a high-cost domain and it will become of less interest to oil explorers than lower-cost regions where huge discoveries could still be made.</p> <p><strong>Power generation </strong>The past high price of wholesale gas and the relatively low price of electricity have led to many gas-fired power stations being closed or mothballed, but although falling gas prices have helped generators, they will need to fall further for many of those plants to break even. Cheaper gas also undermines the competitiveness of other forms of power generation such as wind and nuclear. A period of low gas prices could make subsidies for new reactors at Hinkley Point in Somerset and new wind farms and solar arrays look even more toxic. Lower gas and oil prices should reduce investor interest in UK shale-gas fracking, which would delight environmentalists but disappoint the government and industry supporters. But overall, lower fossil fuel prices - oil, gas and coal - will weaken the hand of those arguing for a low-carbon economy.</p>",

This was hardly the resounding vote of confidence new chief executive Dave Lewis would have wanted as he prepares to unveil the group\u2019s half-year figures on Thursday. Lewis clearly has a difficult task. He must try to convince investors that Tesco is on the right track after the revelation of a \u00a3250m black hole in its profits, the suspension of several senior executives and continuing worries about a supermarket price war. The City will want updates on the investigations into the scandal, which analysts fear could disrupt the supermarket\u2019s preparations for the vital Christmas period, with commercial staff ordered to hand over their laptops and supplier meetings delayed. Lewis will also have to explain his thinking on pricing, promotions, store formats and dividend policy. Some in the City think Lewis should unveil a \u00a33bn cash call to bolster the balance sheet. Others would prefer disposals of, say, stores in Thailand or data specialist Dunnhumby.
