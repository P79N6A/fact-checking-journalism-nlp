      "bodyText": "It looks terrible for the Pension Protection Fund (PPF): the pensions lifeboat fund is planning to vote against a restructuring of the UK arm of Toys R Us, an action that could mean 3,200 people lose their jobs. On the company\u2019s proposal, only 800 employees would depart and the others would resume the fight against Amazon\u2019s invasion of the toy market. The PPF, however, is not to blame for this mess. Its hands are tied. The PPF\u2019s jobis to look out for the interests of pensioners in Toys R Us\u2019s defined benefit scheme and bargain accordingly. It has put forward a plan that looks more than reasonable: Toys R Us, as the price of support for its self-help plan, should put \u00a39m into a pension fund that is showing a \u00a330m deficit. The company pleads it hasn\u2019t got the money, a cry that raises many questions, most of them identified by Frank Field, the chairman of the work and pensions select committee. What on Earth was going on when the UK division of Toys R Us wrote off a \u00a3584m loan to the US parent, which has entered bankruptcy proceedings? And why was the UK managing director of Toys R Us being paid \u00a31.3m last year? For now, the PPF must contain itself to the immediate question of Toys R Us\u2019s survival prospects in the UK. If the company \u2013 actually \u2013 can find \u00a39m, it should cough up. If the cupboard really is bare, then the self-help plan may be doomed anyway and carrying on could make matters worse for the PPF. So-called company voluntary arrangements, of the sort Toys R Us is seeking, do not have a great record of success. The best short-term solution is for Toys R Us\u2019s management to turn somersaults to find the \u00a39m. If it\u2019s too late to ask the US bankruptcy courts to waive annual royalty payments of \u00a38m-ish for a year, then look for a bridging loan or find other means. Managements cannot just assume that the PPF, when pushed, will agree to anything. Whatever happens at Thursday\u2019s CVA hearing, that huge loan write-off needs to be examined by the Pensions Regulator. There may be an innocent explanation but, on the face of it, it is extraordinary that the trustees of the pension fund and the regulator were kept in the dark. One lesson from the BHS pensions debacle was that the regulator needs more powers to intervene in substantial transactions. The government, which hasn\u2019t got further than a white paper, needs to hurry up. Tales from the City Which version of events do you prefer? Did Donald Brydon, the chairman of the London Stock Exchange, score a thumping four-to-one majority as shareholders rallied to his support to put a decisive end to the fallout from Xavier Rolet\u2019s departure as chief executive? Or did he achieve a hollow victory that leaves his authority damaged? A fair analysis probably lies somewhere between those extremes. In the weird world of City voting, where mega majorities are the norm, 79% support counts as an in-between result. Anything less than 80% these days gets a company on a \u201cblacklist\u201d where it is obliged to explain what it plans to do to improve relations with shareholders. The LSE will now suffer that indignity. The angry hedge fund manager Sir Christopher Hohn, who bizarrely didn\u2019t bother to turn up to a meeting he had called, was crowing about the blacklist point afterwards. Fair enough. Yet let\u2019s not lose sight of the wider picture. Hohn\u2019s TCI fund set out to keep Rolet at the LSE until 2021 but only hastened his departure. The chief executive went last month, instead of staying until a successor could be recruited next year. Hohn can\u2019t put a positive gloss on that outcome. He failed to achieve his main goal. Brydon\u2019s mistake \u2013 actually, the mistake of all the non-executive directors \u2013 was smaller. The LSE\u2019s board should have said more in the first place about its reasons for wishing to replace Rolet after nine successful years. The chairman is correct to say boards can\u2019t be expected to put \u201call relevant information\u201d in the public domain. Equally, however, there is a skill in saying just enough to prevent Hohn-style explosions. Brydon is now safe to lead the hiring of a new chief executive and carries the confidence of the regulators, which is what matters after Tuesday\u2019s vote. Will he, though, make it all the way to April 2019, the previously agreed compromise date for his own departure? If he\u2019s determined to do so, he probably can. Do not be surprised, however, if late 2018 is deemed a better fudge. \u2022 Follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk, or sign up to the daily Business Today email here.",

In a presentation prepared for lenders at a meeting in London on Tuesday, Steinhoff said the position of its operating companies, including Poundland, which it bought last year, as well as Harveys and Bensons for Beds in the UK, was \u201cevolving daily\u201d with credit insurance being cancelled or reduced and credit facilities being suspended. It emerged on Friday that Poundland faces potential difficulties with suppliers after an insurance company reduced its cover on credit for those selling goods to the cut-price chain. Steinhoff\u2019s shares have dived more than 80% since the company admitted earlier this month that it faced criminal and tax investigations relating to an estimated $7bn (\u00a35.3bn) hole in its accounts. They fell sharply again on Tuesday after the latest update. PricewaterhouseCoopers has been investigating the accounting irregularities, linked to Steinhoff\u2019s assets outside South Africa. Steinhoff said on Tuesday it could not provide further detail on the magnitude of the problem or when it could produce audited accounts for 2017 and restated accounts for last year. The company said others years\u2019 accounts might also need to be restated. But Poundland\u2019s boss Andy Bond told creditors that the business was trading well with sales at established stores increasing by 4% in the period since the end of March compared to last year.

      "bodyText": "In the 500th anniversary of the Reformation, which challenged a single dominant belief system, we agree it is time for the reformation of another all-embracing and powerful set of beliefs: that of mainstream economics (Larry Elliott: Economics needs a Reformation of its own, 18 December). Neoclassical theories currently dominate the university teaching of economics, as well as public debate, policy and decision making. Yet we believe they have assumed this level of influence not as the result of open debate, challenge and the scientific method, but as a belief system whose founding principles now pass unquestioned. Its proponents claim special authority to pronounce on all matters and its teaching has taken on the characteristics of indoctrination: students being asked to memorise and repeat rather than to criticise and evaluate. The world faces poverty, inequality, ecological crises and financial instability that mainstream economics, apparently incapable of self-correction, seems powerless to understand, let alone help address. We support the call made last week in the publication of \u201c33 theses for an economics reformation\u201d for radically greater pluralism, and believe this necessary if we are to reverse these problems. It must begin with reform of the way economics research is funded in universities, which under the present system perpetuates the monopoly of a single narrow perspective. Ending the unhealthy intellectual monopoly within economics is not just about making the discipline more effective and democratic, it is essential to raise our collective chances of surviving and thriving.

However, none of the 33 Theses for an Economics Reformation aim to correct the key omissions in mainstream economics that render it gender blind, and therefore powerless to address both current gender inequalities and the unsustainability of care provision around the world. The 33 theses rightly highlight that ecological systems are central to the functioning of the economy and challenge economic models that treat the natural world as somehow external to the economy. The same message should be included about care provision. To create an economics that works for women as well as men requires recognition of the economic importance of unpaid work in families and communities, the centrality of care to human wellbeing and that the care of people is a necessary component of the way economies reproduce themselves. Without such a recognition, the long overdue Economics Reformation risks being partial and will inevitably let down half the world\u2019s population.

The problem for me is that economics has forgotten what it once knew. One of the \u201cgreats\u201d of the subject, John Stuart Mill, said in the 19th century that economics proceeds under the assumption that humans are \u201cdetermined by nature, to prefer a greater portion of wealth to a smaller in all cases\u201d. This is what we refer to today as rational economic man. But how many economists today are aware of his qualification? \u201cNot that any political economist was ever so absurd as to suppose mankind are really thus constituted, but because this is the mode in which the science must necessarily proceed\u201d. Mill believed that we could only draw useful conclusions from economics by reintegrating them back into a wider social model. Unfortunately many economists today do seem to suppose mankind is thus constituted and Mill is forgotten. Dr Pete Clarke Wallasey, Merseyside \u2022 It is excellent that some economists and students of economics are trying to bring about a revolution in the discipline. But Larry Elliott\u2019s account fails to go to the heart of the matter. At root, economics is concerned to help solve a problem of living, having to do with the creation and distribution of wealth \u2013 or, better, the sustainable creation and just distribution of wealth. Granted that the task of economics is to improve our attempts at solving this basic, real-life problem, economics needs to give intellectual priority not to theory or the pursuit of knowledge, but to (a) getting clearer what our economic problems are, and (b) proposing and critically assessing policies designed to help solve them. Knowledge needs to be sought as a secondary activity, to support those basic tasks. As I argued in detail in a book called From Knowledge to Wisdom first published in 1984, a revolution is needed in economic thinking so that the central task becomes to develop imaginative and critical thinking about what we need to do to solve our economic problems.

      "body": "<p>In the 500th anniversary of the Reformation, which challenged a single dominant belief system, we agree it is time for the reformation of another all-embracing and powerful set of beliefs: that of mainstream economics (Larry Elliott: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/dec/17/heretics-welcome-economics-needs-a-new-reformation\" title=\"\">Economics needs a Reformation of its own</a>, 18 December). Neoclassical theories currently dominate the university teaching of economics, as well as public debate, policy and decision making. Yet we believe they have assumed this level of influence not as the result of open debate, challenge and the scientific method, but as a belief system whose founding principles now pass unquestioned. Its proponents claim special authority to pronounce on all matters and its teaching has taken on the characteristics of indoctrination: students being asked to memorise and repeat rather than to criticise and evaluate.</p> <p>The world faces poverty, inequality, ecological crises and financial instability that mainstream economics, apparently incapable of self-correction, seems powerless to understand, let alone help address. We support the call made last week in the publication of \u201c<a href=\"http://www.newweather.org/2017/12/12/the-new-reformation-33-theses-for-an-economics-reformation/\" title=\"\">33 theses for an economics reformation</a>\u201d for radically greater pluralism, and believe this necessary if we are to reverse these problems. It must begin with reform of the way economics research is funded in universities, which under the present system perpetuates the monopoly of a single narrow perspective. Ending the unhealthy intellectual monopoly within economics is not just about making the discipline more effective and democratic, it is essential to raise our collective chances of surviving and thriving.</p> <p><em> </em><strong>Victoria Chick</strong><em> Emeritus professor of Economics, University College London, </em><strong>Professor Stephany Griffith-Jones</strong><em> Financial markets director, Columbia University, </em><strong>Frances Stewart</strong><em> Professor emeritus, University of Oxford, </em><strong>Jayati Ghosh</strong><em> Professor of economics, Jawaharlal Nehru University, New Delhi, India, </em><strong>Steve Keen</strong><em> Professor of economics, author Debunking Economics, </em><strong>Andrew Simms</strong><em> New Weather Institute, research associate, University of Sussex, </em><strong>Prof Danny Dorling</strong><em> Oxford University, </em><strong>Dr Ha-Joon Chang</strong><em> Reader in economics, University of Cambridge, </em><strong>Sir David King</strong><em> Emeritus professor, University of Cambridge, </em><strong>Ian Gough</strong><em> Visiting professor, London School of Economics, </em><strong>Kate E Pickett</strong><em> Professor of epidemiology, University of York, </em><strong>Tim Jackson</strong><em> Professor of sustainable development, University of Surrey, </em><strong>Kate Raworth</strong><em> Environmental Change Institute, Oxford University, </em><strong>Richard Wilkinson</strong><em> Emeritus professor of social epidemiology, University of Nottingham, </em><strong>Professor Adam David Morton</strong><em> Department of political economy, University of Sydney,</em> <strong>Peter Newell</strong><em> Professor of international relations, University of Sussex, </em><strong>Mario Seccareccia</strong><em> Professor of economics, University of Ottawa, </em><strong>Mehmet Ugur</strong><em> Professor of economics and institutions, University of Greenwich, </em><strong>Richard Murphy</strong><em> Professor of international political economy, City, University of London, </em><strong>Alan Cibils</strong><em> Professor of political economy, Universidad Nacional de General Sarmiento, Argentina, </em><strong>Professor Rebecca Malby</strong><em> London South Bank University, </em><strong>Mike Danson</strong><em> Professor of enterprise policy, Heriot-Watt University,</em> <strong>Prof Tim Lang</strong><em> City, University of London, </em><strong>Prof Christine Cooper</strong><em> University of Strathclyde, </em><strong>Bill McGuire</strong><em> Professor emeritus of geophysical and climate hazards, University College London, </em><strong>Cyrus Bina</strong><em> Distinguished research professor of economics, University of Minnesota, </em><strong>Marc Lavoie</strong><em> Senior research chair, Universit\u00e9 Sorbonne Paris Cit\u00e9, Emeritus professor, Department of Economics, University of Ottawa, </em><strong>Louis Philippe Rochon</strong><em> Full professor, economics, Laurentian University, </em><strong>Professor Alfredo Saad Filho</strong><em> Department of Development Studies, Soas, University of London, </em><strong>Professor Lyla Mehta</strong><em> Institute of Development Studies, UK, </em><strong>Pritam Singh</strong><em> Professor of economics, Oxford Brookes Business School, </em><strong>John Weeks</strong><em> Professor emeritus of economics, Soas, University of London, </em><strong>Professor Rhys Jenkins</strong><em> School of International Development, University of East Anglia, </em><strong>Professor Aled Jones</strong><em> Global Sustainability Institute, Anglia Ruskin University, </em><strong>Professor Howard Stein</strong><em> Department of Epidemiology, University of Michigan,</em> <strong>Michael Lipton</strong><em> Emeritus professor, economics, Sussex University, </em><strong>Professor Emeritus Geoffrey C Harcourt</strong><em> Adelaide, Emeritus reader in the history of economic theory, Cambridge, </em><strong>Peter Taylor-Gooby</strong><em> Professor of social policy, University of Kent, </em><strong>Tony Greenham</strong><em> Director of economics, Royal Society of Arts, Manufactures and Commerce,</em> <strong>Victor Anderson</strong><em> Visiting professor, Global Sustainability Institute, Anglia Ruskin University, </em><strong>Philip Daniel</strong><em> Honorary professor, University of Dundee, </em><strong>Judith Heyer</strong><em> Emeritus fellow, economics, Somerville College, Oxford, </em><strong>Dr Suzanne J Konzelmann</strong><em> Reader in management, Birkbeck, University of London;

However, none of the 33 Theses for an Economics Reformation aim to correct the key omissions in mainstream economics that render it gender blind, and therefore powerless to address both current gender inequalities and the unsustainability of care provision around the world. The 33 theses rightly highlight that ecological systems are central to the functioning of the economy and challenge economic models that treat the natural world as somehow external to&#xa0;the economy. The same message should be included about care provision.</p> <p>To create an economics that works for women as well as men requires recognition of the economic importance of unpaid work in families and communities, the centrality of care to human wellbeing and that the care of people is a necessary component of the way economies reproduce themselves. Without such a recognition, the long overdue Economics Reformation risks being partial and will inevitably let down half the world\u2019s population.</p> <p><em> </em><strong>Dr Mary-Ann Stephenson</strong><em> Director, Women\u2019s Budget Group, </em><strong>Dr Angela O\u2019Hagen</strong><em> Convenor, Scottish Women\u2019s Budget Group, </em><strong>Susan Himmelweit</strong><em> Emeritus professor of economics, Open University, </em><strong>Diane Elson</strong><em> Emeritus professor, University of Essex</em>, <strong>Dr Kate Maclean</strong><em> Birkbeck, University of London, </em><strong>Rosalind Bragg</strong><em> Director, Maternity Action, </em><strong>Dr Johnna Montgomerie</strong><em> Senior lecturer in economics, Goldsmiths, University of London, </em><strong>Ruth Pearson</strong><em> Emeritus professor, University of Leeds, </em><strong>Annalise Verity Johns,</strong> <strong>Polly Trenow, Ceri Hughes</strong><em> University of Manchester, </em><strong>Dr Jay Ginn</strong><em> Associate, Centre for Research on Ageing and Gender, Surrey University, </em><strong>Marie Lewis</strong><em> Independent researcher, </em><strong>Dr Jerome De Henau</strong><em> Senior lecturer in economics, Open University, </em><strong>Dr Gill Kirkup</strong><em> Senior lecturer for the Institute of Educational Technology, Open University, </em><strong>Dr Penny Vera-Sanso</strong><em> Birkbeck, University of London, </em><strong>Hilary Land</strong><em> Emeritus professor of family policy and child welfare, University of Bristol, </em><strong>Professor Diane Perrons</strong><em> London School of Economics, </em><strong>Helen Jackson, Dr Sarah Marie Hall</strong><em> Lecturer in human geography, University of Manchester, </em><strong>Fran Bennett</strong></p> <p>\u2022 As a former teacher of the history of economic thought I was interested to read Larry Elliott\u2019s article. The problem for me is that economics has forgotten what it once knew. One of the \u201cgreats\u201d of the subject, John Stuart Mill, said in the 19th century that economics proceeds under the assumption that humans are \u201cdetermined by nature, to prefer a greater portion of wealth to a smaller in all cases\u201d. This is what we refer to today as rational economic man. But how many economists today are aware of his qualification? \u201cNot that any political economist was ever so absurd as to suppose mankind are really thus constituted, but because this is the mode in which the science must necessarily proceed\u201d. Mill&#xa0;believed that we could only draw useful conclusions from economics by reintegrating them back into a wider social model. Unfortunately many economists today do seem to suppose mankind is thus constituted and Mill is forgotten.<br><strong>Dr Pete Clarke</strong><br><em>Wallasey, Merseyside</em></p> <p>\u2022 It is excellent that some economists and students of economics are trying to bring about a revolution in the discipline.

      "bodyText": "Tesco food standards inspectors unearthed a series of \u201cmajor\u201d process issues at a second 2 Sisters Food Group factory, on the same weekend that separate concerns prompted the closure of the UK\u2019s largest chicken supplier\u2019s West Bromwich site. Leaked documents show how in October the supermarket\u2019s auditors gave what they described as a \u201cred\u201d warning rating to 2 Sisters\u2019 chicken plant in Scotland, which supplies Asda, Sainsbury\u2019s, Marks &amp; Spencer, Lidl, Aldi, Co-op and Iceland, as well as Tesco. The report was part of a series of emergency inspections of 2 Sisters chicken factories that were conducted as a direct result of a Guardian and ITV undercover investigation into the food processing firm\u2019s \u201cSite D\u201d factory in West Bromwich. Tesco said that having unearthed process problems at the Coupar Angus plant in Perth and Kinross \u2013 which were all distinct from what was filmed at Site D \u2013 it \u201cinsisted these were addressed immediately to prevent any food safety issues\u201d. The supermarket had previously rated the site as \u201cgreen\u201d. The Guardian understands that further, unidentified, 2 Sisters factories were also marked as \u201cred\u201d during the same series of emergency inspections. A \u201cred\u201d warning can be given for a number of reasons, including a single \u201ccritical\u201d issue that puts food safety at risk. Coupar Angus was marked as \u201cred\u201d after Tesco auditors found five compliance issues it categorised as \u201cmajor\u201d \u2013 which the supermarket defines as \u201ca deficiency which requires prompt attention to prevent a potential food safety failure or legal issue from arising\u201d. Fewer than 1% of Tesco supplier sites receive a \u201cred\u201d audit rating, the worst score in the supermarket\u2019s internal colour-coded safety and quality compliance system. Processes and traceability are considered crucial within the food industry, as if they are compromised it potentially affects a supplier\u2019s ability to guarantee its food is safe. The Tesco audit documents state that the problems found at 2 Sisters\u2019 Coupar Angus plant included: Organic and non-organic chickens being mixed \u2013 with \u201cinsufficient evidence to support [corrective actions] and end product fate\u201d. A computer system that allowed all factory workers \u201cto change UB [use-by] dates\u201d. \u201cSeveral instances ... of double labelling/no labelling\u201d. \u201cSerious issues\u201d with records designed to account for chickens earmarked for disposal, with auditors concluding \u201cthe site cannot fully demonstrate which products have been sent to waste\u201d. \u201cFailed\u201d efforts to trace chicken recorded as being despatched from the plant. A spokesperson for 2 Sisters said that neither the mixed organic and standard chicken, nor poultry earmarked for disposal, had been despatched to customers. The company added it does not supply standard chicken as organic and that the crates of meat auditors had failed to trace had not entered the food chain. On the subject of the site\u2019s computer system allowing any worker to change use-by dates, 2 Sisters said: \u201cThere was no evidence that this was actually happening, even if this was theoretically possible (although only a trained employee would have the ability to do this) ... Following the report, [2 Sisters has] taken steps to make the computer more secure, including moving it to a new location\u201d. The inspection was carried out after the airing of undercover footage at 2 Sisters\u2019 West Bromwich plant that showed an instance of workers altering slaughter dates of chicken, the plant mixing older meat with fresh and workers returning chickens to the production line from the floor. The chicken processor has denied the footage at that factory showed any food safety breaches and said it temporarily suspended production in West Bromwich three days later because of process failures, adding its \u201cinternal investigation has shown some isolated instances of non-compliance with our own quality management systems\u201d. Three days after the site was closed, Tesco chief executive Dave Lewis was asked by the Guardian what failings had been found internally by 2 Sisters that were serious enough to prompt a suspension in production. He declined to answer, but said the supermarket had since inspected all 12 of 2 Sisters\u2019 chicken factories and that he believed the problems were contained to Site D. Lewis said: \u201cHaving been to all the other [sites] \u2026 we didn\u2019t find anything that would indicate that what was seen in West Bromwich was present in any of the other factory sites,\u201d he said. \u201cWe did go to all other factories, so we don\u2019t think our inspectors have had the wool pulled over their eyes.\u201d Tesco said that Lewis was talking about his inspection teams finding no evidence of food safety risks at 2 Sisters sites. The supermarket added that red ratings are not routinely shared with the chief executive, albeit at a time when questions about the transparency of the food inspection regime, plus general standards within the industry, were being raised by the public and MPs. Since being contacted by the Guardian and ITV, Tesco has shared its emergency 2 Sisters inspection reports with food regulators. After studying Tesco\u2019s Coupar Angus audit findings Prof Chris Elliott, a food safety academic from Queen\u2019s University Belfast, said: \u201cThis inspection seems to have been very thorough and details a series of what appear to be important systems failures. These do seem to mirror closely the issues identified at the West Bromwich factory [regarding the robustness of the traceability systems].\u201d \u201cThe audit contains no evidence of fraudulent practices by 2 Sisters at the site but the major failings identified, particularly the organic segregation and seeming lack of robust traceability, leaves the factory vulnerable.\u201d The Coupar Angus inspection did not find that the food produced was unsafe or that food safety regulations had been breached. Lawyers said that traceability rules were established to help ensure food safety \u2013 and if traceability is compromised, potentially so is a supplier\u2019s ability to guarantee food safety. Andy Bowles, a solicitor at ABC Food Law, said: \u201cI think there are potential food safety concerns here. Traceability is about assuring supply chains to ensure raw materials [and] products are processed under appropriate conditions. If you lose traceability then you lose those assurances and therefore traceability is an inherent part of food safety ... That is the concern here.\u201d A spokesperson for Tesco said: \u201cWhen we became aware of the issues at 2 Sisters\u2019 West Bromwich site, we immediately conducted an additional 46 visits and inspections across other 2 Sisters poultry sites. \u201cOur inspection [of Coupar Angus] highlighted a number of inadequate processes at this site, including labelling, segregation, traceability and recording. We insisted these were addressed immediately to prevent any food safety issues. \u201c[Tesco boss] Dave Lewis was made aware that these inspections had not identified breaches of food safety at other 2 Sisters sites. Specifically the issues identified at West Bromwich were not identified in the reports. He insisted all appropriate preventative measures should be taken to avoid any potential future issues across all sites.\u201d A spokesperson for 2 Sisters Food Group said: \u201cITV and the Guardian are referring to standard inspection audits and appear to be trying to damage the reputation of our factories and potentially the livelihoods of 23,000 colleagues by misrepresenting them. There is and never was any risk to food safety at Coupar Angus. This is using old news to highlight issues which were resolved with our customer two months ago.\u201d Lidl and Marks &amp; Spencer said the factory was currently running to their standards. M&amp;S said it had \u201clast audited the site in November and Food Standards Scotland has a full-time presence at the site supporting the 2 Sisters management team\u201d. Aldi said it had found no labelling or traceability issues at Coupar Angus, while Co-op said it had unearthed no food safety breaches. Iceland said it had not inspected the site itself for almost 23 months. Sainsbury\u2019s said it would always investigate quality and safety concerns, while Asda did not comment.",

Following the report, [2 Sisters has] taken steps to make the computer more secure, including moving it to a new location\u201d.</p> <p>The inspection was carried out after the airing of undercover footage at 2 Sisters\u2019 West Bromwich plant that showed an instance of workers altering slaughter dates of chicken, the plant mixing older meat with fresh and workers returning chickens to the production line from the floor.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"713968950c75aa75008d696742a9d4aef4944a0b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/713968950c75aa75008d696742a9d4aef4944a0b/169_36_2266_1359/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A drone image of 2 Sisters\u2019 Coupar Angus chicken processing plant.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A drone image of 2 Sisters\u2019 Coupar Angus chicken processing plant.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: ITN</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The chicken processor has denied the footage at that factory showed any food safety breaches and said it <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/oct/01/scandal-hit-2-sisters-suspends-chicken-production-at-west-midlands-plant\">temporarily suspended production in West Bromwich three days later because of process failures</a>, adding its \u201cinternal investigation has shown some isolated instances of non-compliance with our own quality management systems\u201d.</p> <p>Three days after the site was closed, Tesco chief executive Dave Lewis was asked by the Guardian what failings had been found internally by 2 Sisters that were serious enough to prompt a suspension in production. He declined to answer, but said the supermarket had since inspected all 12 of 2 Sisters\u2019 chicken factories and that he believed the problems were contained to Site D.<br></p> <p>Lewis said: \u201cHaving been to all the other [sites] \u2026 we didn\u2019t find anything that would indicate that what was seen in West Bromwich was present in any of the other factory sites,\u201d he said. \u201cWe did go to all other factories, so we don\u2019t think our inspectors have had the wool pulled over their eyes.\u201d</p> <p>Tesco said that Lewis was talking about his inspection teams finding no evidence of food safety risks at 2 Sisters sites. The supermarket added that red ratings are not routinely shared with the chief executive, albeit at a time when questions about the transparency of the food inspection regime, plus general standards within the industry, were being raised by the public and MPs.</p> <p>Since being contacted by the Guardian and ITV, Tesco has shared its emergency 2 Sisters inspection reports with food regulators.</p> <p>After studying Tesco\u2019s Coupar Angus audit findings Prof Chris Elliott, a food safety academic from Queen\u2019s University Belfast, said: \u201cThis inspection seems to have been very thorough and details a series of what appear to be important systems failures. These do seem to mirror closely the issues identified at the West Bromwich factory [regarding the robustness of the traceability systems].\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe audit contains no evidence of fraudulent practices by 2 Sisters at the site but the major failings identified, particularly the organic segregation and seeming lack of robust traceability, leaves the factory vulnerable.\u201d</p> <p>The Coupar Angus inspection did not find that the food produced was unsafe or that food safety regulations had been breached. Lawyers said that traceability rules were established to help ensure food safety \u2013 and if traceability is compromised, potentially so is a supplier\u2019s ability to guarantee food safety.</p> <p>Andy Bowles, a solicitor at ABC Food Law, said: \u201cI think there are potential food safety concerns here. Traceability is about assuring supply chains to ensure raw materials [and] products are processed under appropriate conditions. If you lose traceability then you lose those assurances and therefore traceability is an inherent part of food safety ... That is the concern here.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9deba4a1084520fc15183d170a54258fdb2431fb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9deba4a1084520fc15183d170a54258fdb2431fb/0_138_2800_1680/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tesco store in Callington\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tesco said it told 2 Sisters to address any inadequate processes immediately to prevent any food safety issues.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: SWNS.COM/SWNS</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>A spokesperson for Tesco said: \u201cWhen we became aware of the issues at 2 Sisters\u2019 West Bromwich site, we immediately conducted an additional 46 visits and inspections across other 2 Sisters poultry sites.</p> <p>\u201cOur inspection [of Coupar Angus] highlighted a number of inadequate processes at this site, including labelling, segregation, traceability and recording.

      "bodyText": "Ryanair has said it will recognise cabin crew unions and hold meetings in the new year, as it prepared to start its first ever talks with pilots\u2019 unions in Dublin on Tuesday. The Irish airline, Europe\u2019s largest by passenger numbers, announced last week that it would recognise pilots\u2019 unions in a bid to head off strikes planned in the run-up to Christmas. The move marked a dramatic shift after decades of refusing to negotiate with unions and came after groups of pilots around Europe called strikes. Ryanair\u2019s announcement that it will also recognise cabin crew unions comes after renewed focus on its treatment of lower-paid staff. Crew have been warned of disciplinary proceedings for missing sales targets on scratchcards, while staff on Italian bases were threatened with collective sanctions if any member joined a strike called last week. The Impact union, whose members include cabin crew, said it would be delighted to start talks in due course. A spokesman said the prospect of strike action in Ireland, originally called for Wednesday, had not gone away and that the mandate remained should Ryanair not properly meet requests for union representation. The airline was due to meet German and Portuguese pilot unions this week, as well as representatives of Ialpa, a branch of the Impact union in Ireland. A company spokesman said: \u201cIt will lead on in the new year to meetings with other EU pilot unions, and cabin crew unions in due course as well.\u201d Pilots had complained of a toxic atmosphere at Ryanair, where many had long been indirectly employed through third parties, an arrangement that had seen some pursued by tax authorities. There had also been problems about rostering and anger over disparaging comments made by the airline\u2019s chief executive, Michael O\u2019Leary. According to a recording of a meeting obtained by the Irish Independent newspaper, Ryanair executives told pilots at Stansted last week that the airline had \u201cgrown too fast\u201d and lost their trust, but was working hard to restore it. Peter Bellew, chief operations officer of Ryanair, told the pilots he knew their problems had not been addressed. \u201cEverywhere I turned, I could see that people were asking for small things to be done and they just weren\u2019t getting done,\u201d he was quoted as saying. \u201cOr, not only were they not getting done, they were getting told: \u2018Piss off; I don\u2019t want to know about this\u2019.\u201d The airline cancelled 20,000 flights this winter due to a shortage of pilots and a rostering error. O\u2019Leary went as far as producing a power point presentation highlighting perceived financial problems at rival operators to prevent an exodus of pilots, to Norwegian in particular. Ryanair has offered substantial pay increases to retain staff. With a large fleet of planes on order, it plans to grow passenger numbers rapidly in the coming years. \u2022 Follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk, or sign up to the daily Business Today email here.",

      "bodyText": "The Pension Protection Fund (PPF) has confirmed it intends to block a proposed restructuring of Toys R Us, pushing the retailer closer to collapse unless a deal can be struck within two days. The future of the the UK arm of Toys R Us and 3,200 jobs hang in the balance as the retailer has said it cannot meet the industry-funded pensions lifeboat\u2019s demand that \u00a39m in extra funds be put into the scheme in the coming months. The industry-funded pensions lifeboat on Tuesday filed its proxy voting intention alongside dozens of other creditors who will vote on a Toys R Us\u2019 planned company voluntary arrangement (CVA) insolvency procedure on Thursday. It is understood that creditors are able to change their vote at the meeting and talks are ongoing between the fund and Toys R Us to find a suitable compromise. But the PPF has indicated it currently plans to block the CVA. If the CVA, which involves the closure of at least 26 loss-making stores, fails, sources close to the company have said the retailer is likely to fall into administration with the potential closure of all 84 permanent stores and about 20 more pop-ups. Malcolm Weir, director of restructuring and insolvency at the PPF, said: \u201cSince the company lodged the CVA proposals we have spent significant time and effort, with the help of PricewaterhouseCoopers, assessing the current and future financial position of the company to ensure the pension scheme would not be weakened by the CVA, leading to an even bigger claim on the PPF and its levy payers further down the line. \u201cGiven the position of the company, we strongly believe seeking assurances for the pension scheme is reasonable given the deficit in the scheme and questions about the overall position of the company. \u201cWe remain in dialogue with the company and their advisers and we are able to amend our vote if suitable assurances provided.\u201d In a letter to Frank Field, chair of parliament\u2019s work and pensions committee, the pensions lifeboat said Toys R Us\u2019s scheme had 600 members and a deficit of \u00a330m under the PPF assessment and as much as \u00a393m on the basis of a buy-out by an insurer. Amid concerns about the future for the Toys R Us UK chain, the PPF said it had asked for \u00a37.3m in additional contributions to be paid into the pension fund about two months after the CVA vote on Thursday, on top of the \u00a31.6m of contributions already due in January and March next year. \u201cGiven the circumstances of the CVA, other payments being made by the company (including royalties to the US parent) together with the deficit in the scheme, we believed this proposal to be reasonable,\u201d the letter said. Toys R Us\u2019s UK business has indicated it does not have the resources to put \u00a39m into its pension fund. Its US parent is also unable to lend its UK subsidiary the cash under the terms of its court-led bankruptcy protection. The parent company filed for Chapter 11, the US version of administration, in September after running up $5bn (\u00a33.7bn) of debts. Field has raised concerns about Toys R Us in the UK writing off \u00a3584.5m in loans owed by a Toys R Us firm based in the British Virgin Islands. The write-off occurred as part of a group reorganisation last year. The regulator has the power to pursue payments from a British company\u2019s overseas owner if they find evidence that a pension scheme has been starved of cash. The regulator has held talks with Toys R Us but there is no suggestion it has found evidence that money has been extracted from the firm to the detriment of the scheme. \u2022 Follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk, or sign up to the daily Business Today email here.",

But the PPF has indicated it currently plans to block the CVA.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/dec/18/toys-r-us-faces-collapse-with-loss-of-3500-uk-jobs\">Toys R Us UK faces collapse with loss of all 3,200 jobs</a> </p> </aside>  <p>If the CVA, which involves the closure of at least 26 loss-making stores, fails, sources close to the company have said the retailer is likely to fall into administration with the potential closure of all 84 permanent stores and about 20 more pop-ups. </p> <p>Malcolm Weir, director of restructuring and insolvency at the PPF, said: \u201cSince the company lodged the CVA proposals we have spent significant time and effort, with the help of PricewaterhouseCoopers, assessing the current and future financial position of the company to ensure the pension scheme would not be weakened by the CVA, leading to an even bigger claim on the PPF and its levy payers further down the line.</p> <p>\u201cGiven the position of the company, we strongly believe seeking assurances for the pension scheme is reasonable given the deficit in the scheme and questions about the overall position of the company. <br></p> <p> \u201cWe remain in dialogue with the company and their advisers and we are able to amend our vote if suitable assurances provided.\u201d</p> <p>In a letter to Frank Field, chair of parliament\u2019s work and pensions committee, the pensions lifeboat said Toys R Us\u2019s scheme had 600 members and a deficit of \u00a330m under the PPF assessment and as much as \u00a393m on the basis of a buy-out by an insurer.</p> <p>Amid concerns about the future for the Toys R Us UK chain, the PPF said it had asked for \u00a37.3m in additional contributions to be paid into the pension fund about two months after the CVA vote on Thursday, on top of the \u00a31.6m of contributions already due in January and March next year.</p> <p>\u201cGiven the circumstances of the CVA, other payments being made by the company (including royalties to the US parent) together with the deficit in the scheme, we believed this proposal to be reasonable,\u201d the letter said. </p> <p>Toys R Us\u2019s UK business has indicated it does not have the resources to put \u00a39m into its pension fund. Its US parent is also unable to lend its UK subsidiary the cash under the terms of its court-led bankruptcy protection. The parent company filed for Chapter 11, the US version of administration, in September <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/sep/19/toys-r-us-files-for-bankruptcy-in-the-us-and-canada\">after running up $5bn (\u00a33.7bn) of debts</a>.<br></p> <p>Field has raised concerns about Toys R Us in the UK writing off \u00a3584.5m in loans owed by a Toys R Us firm based in the British Virgin Islands. The write-off occurred as part of a group reorganisation last year.</p> <p>The regulator has the power to pursue payments from a British company\u2019s overseas owner if they find evidence that a pension scheme has been starved of cash. The regulator has held talks with Toys R Us but there is no suggestion it has found evidence that money has been extracted from the firm to the detriment of the scheme.</p> <p>\u2022 Follow Guardian Business on Twitter at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BusinessDesk\">@BusinessDesk</a>, or sign up to the daily Business Today email <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/info/2017/may/16/guardian-business-today-sign-up-financial-news-email?CMP=business_footnote\">here</a>.</p>",
