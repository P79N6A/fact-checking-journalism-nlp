      "bodyText": "Philip Hammond was on Tuesday being urged to ignore a small and unexpected fall in inflation and use next week\u2019s autumn statement to protect Britain\u2019s poorest families from an expected sharp rise in the cost of living in 2017. The chancellor was provided with a boost ahead of his first set-piece occasion on November 23 when cheaper clothes and a smaller increase in university tuition fees meant the annual increase in the cost of living as measured by the consumer prices index fell from 1% to 0.9%. But City economists, academics and thinktanks said the drop in inflation \u2013 which followed a 0.4 percentage point rise in September \u2013 would prove temporary and that the upward trend would continue as the impact of the cheaper pound on imports became clear over the coming months. Helen Barnard, head of analysis at the independent Joseph Rowntree Foundation, said: \u201cHigher costs of goods and essentials impact on poorer families more, so ensuring support for those on low incomes keeps up is crucial. The poorest fifth of people in the UK spend \u00a31 in every \u00a36 of their income on food, much more than middle-income earners, so a price rise will have a bigger impact on the household budgets of less wealthy families.\u201d Barnard said the four-year freeze on working-age benefits announced by George Osborne in 2015 looked \u201cincreasingly out-of-date and should be lifted in the autumn statement.\u201d Andrew Goodwin, UK economist at Oxford Economics, said: \u201cThe four-year cash freeze on most working age benefits was introduced at a time when inflation was expected to be much weaker. Subsequent developments mean that those affected will endure a much more significant squeeze than had been anticipated, so the chancellor could be minded to use next week\u2019s autumn statement to announce a one or two-year hiatus in the benefits freeze in order to try and alleviate some of the extra pressure that it will cause.\u201d The Office for National Statistics said that in addition to cut-price clothes and university fees, inflation was dragged down by offers on toys and games, reductions in the cost of overnight hotel stays and falling prices for non-alcoholic drinks. While the ONS said there was no evidence that the depreciation of sterling since the Brexit vote in June had led to dearer prices in the shops, there were signs of the exchange rate affecting the cost of manufactured goods leaving factories. Factory gate prices in October were 2.1% higher than a year earlier, up from 1.3%. Manufacturers are being forced to pass on the cost of rising fuel and raw materials, up 12.2% in the 12 months ending in October compared with a 7.3% increase in September.",

      "bodyText": "A big increase in the number of offices and shops converted into flats is behind a surge in England\u2019s housing stock, official figures show. There were 189,650 dwellings added to the housing stock in England between April 2015 and March 2016, up 11% on the year before, according to Department for Communities and Local Government (DCLG) figures. Traditional new-build properties rose by 8,860 units to 163,940. But the most marked increase was in \u201cchange of use\u201d, with 30,600 new units compared with 20,650 the year before. Of these, 12,824 were offices converted into flats. Landmark office towers in the centre of London, such as the controversial Centre Point building, have been the highest-profile blocks to switch to residential. But many drab 1960s offices in suburban locations have also been revamped into studios and apartments. There have been more conversions of office space in Croydon, south London, than in any other part of the UK, with many of its concrete 60s office blocks no longer fit for modern commercial use. Just four years ago, around half the office space in Croydon was empty \u2013 a worse ratio than downturn Detroit \u2013 but the area has since seen a frenzy of office conversion activity. The boom is partly down to new \u201cpermitted development rights,\u201d which allow developers to proceed without conventional planning permission, though critics say the result is that many units fail to meet minimum space standards. The total number of new builds also remains far short of the 200,000 units a year the government has pledged to meet its \u201cmillion homes by 2020\u201d target. The number of new builds fell sharply during the financial crisis, while the annual \u201cnew net additions\u201d to the housing stock is still running at 15% below the 2007-08 peak. Sir Michael Lyons, a former BBC chairman whose Lyons commission has called for a big increase in housebuilding, said: \u201cIt\u2019s good to see that housebuilding figures are up, but converting office buildings can\u2019t go on forever, you do actually have to build new homes. It\u2019s definitely 250,000-plus [new homes] we need, but we haven\u2019t built more than 200,000 a year for more than 30 years.\u201d The housing and planning minister, Gavin Barwell, said the DCLG figures showed \u201cBritain is building again \u2026 We promised to turbo-charge housebuilding so more people can have the security of their own home, and that is exactly what we are doing with the biggest increase in the number of new homes in many years.\u201d The biggest rise in housebuilding in England has been around Cherwell in north Oxfordshire, Dartford in Kent and Tower Hamlets in London, said the DCLG. But in Sefton (Merseyside), Bexley (London) and Cannock Chase (Staffordshire) the number of homes went into reverse, with demolitions outnumbering new builds. An independent report commissioned by the shadow secretary of state for housing, John Healey, and led by Pete Redfern, the chief executive of Taylor Wimpey, calls for a new independent housing commission to \u201ctake a non-partisan approach to long-term housing decisions\u201d. The Redfern review notes that home ownership has fallen from 70.9% in 2003 to 63.6% today overall, and that among 25- to 34-year-olds it has slumped from 58.6% to 36.7%. It blames a mix of high house prices, tougher lending restrictions and a relative fall in the income of first-time buyers for the squeeze on home ownership. It calls for an increase in housebuilding but says that even if building hits 300,000 a year, it would only reduce prices by 0.6% \u201cgiven recent rates of household formation\u201d. Healey said: \u201cThe shrinking opportunity for young people on ordinary incomes to own a home is at the centre of the growing gulf between housing haves and housing have-nots.\u201d This article was amended on 16 November 2016 to remove a reference to the Shell Centre, which remains an office block.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "It\u2019s a bit cheeky of Pete Redfern to bill his report into the decline of home ownership as \u201cindependent\u201d. He is chief executive of Taylor Wimpey, one of the country\u2019s biggest housebuilders, so he doesn\u2019t arrive on the scene free of commercial interests. Never mind. He was asked by the Labour party to lead the study and can\u2019t be blamed for accepting the gig. More to the point, his review isn\u2019t obviously stuffed with measures that would benefit builders of private homes. It does not, for example, recommend that the government should throw yet more subsidies at homebuyers in the manner of George Osborne, the chancellor who did so much to improve housebuilders\u2019 profits and share prices. Instead, the Redfern review says help-to-buy schemes are inflationary and should be restricted to first-time buyers seeking lower-priced homes. Quite right. Osborne\u2019s scattergun approach was wasteful. Nor is Redfern fixated with private homes. \u201cA fair housing market also needs both a healthy private rented sector and a supportive social housing sector,\u201d says the report. It\u2019s hard to disagree. For the past 30 years, governments\u2019 obsession with home ownership has deprived local authorities of the funds to build affordable properties for rent. The first step towards sanity must be support for all types of tenure. It cannot be said, however, that the report offers fresh insight into why home ownership fell 6.2 percentage points between 2002 and 2014. The chief finding is exactly as you would expect: fewer young people could afford to buy. House prices rose rapidly before the banking crisis; then credit constraints kicked in; and a constant driver was the decline in incomes of those aged 28 to 40 relative to older people. Redfern does have one novel suggestion, however: set up an independent housing commission, modelled on the new Infrastructure Commission, to provide long-term thinking on housing. This idea may feel like an intellectual cop-out but, at the core, there is a good point. Boosting the supply of new houses only makes a difference if higher volumes are sustained over the very long term, like a couple of decades. Since governments tend to be obsessed by short-term sticking plasters, an outside adviser-cum-enforcer might stand a better chance of success. It\u2019s Labour\u2019s report but Theresa May, also in search of a new housing policy, could consider pinching the commission idea. EasyJet expansion will set Stelios spluttering The explosion from Sir Stelios Haji-Ioannou hasn\u2019t been heard yet, but it may only be a matter of time. EasyJet, in the face of a 28% fall in annual profits and a 40% decline in the share price in the past 18 months, is stepping up its expansion. Capacity will be increased by 9% this year. The airline\u2019s founder, but merely 34% shareholder with his family these days, tends to hate any plan that carries the risk of flying with lots of empty seats. He may not be impressed. The case for the defence, however, is strong. Post-Brexit Brits will still want to take holidays in the Med, even if they know that eurozone-land will be pricier. Overall, the European short-haul market is expected to grow by 3.5% next year. Expanding at 9% may nevertheless appear rash but many of easyJet\u2019s competitors will do well just to stand still. So best to take advantage of the weaknesses of the likes of Monarch, Air Berlin and Air France-KLM. Adding capacity in Luton, where the airport is expanding anyway, and Venice, flight capital of a prosperous corner of northern Italy, doesn\u2019t look wildly aggressive. But, note, the benefits will only be felt in time. It may be several years before easyJet enjoys a vintage year like 2015 when pre-tax profits were \u00a3686m. The latest year, at \u00a3495m, looks a better short-term yardstick; revenues per seat, down 6.4%, will not bounce back quickly, and nor (one suspects) will the pound. The consolation for shareholders ought to be the dividend. Sir Stelios fought a long and successful campaign to force easyJet to be more generous. Now, in a harsher trading climate for all airlines, he can enjoy the fruits of a policy that mechanically sets payouts at 50% of post-tax earnings. For a long-term holder like him, that\u2019s not so bad. Vodafone getting poor reception from investors \u201cAny company that gives stuff away is not a company, it is a charity.\u201d So says Vittorio Colao, chief executive of Vodafone, who is miffed that India\u2019s richest man is offering telecoms services for free as a promotional stunt. The result is \u20ac6.3bn (\u00a35.5bn) writedown in the value of Vodafone\u2019s local operation in India and a reminder of the perils of expanding boldly in emerging markets. But it hardly explains why Vodafone\u2019s share price has fallen from 235p in August to 202p on Tuesday. The core European operation is finally looking perkier and forecasts for overall top-line profits are intact at \u20ac16bn-ish. Yes, debt is enormous but free cashflow covers a dividend that yields 6.2% in sterling terms. Maybe investors are just bored of waiting for a takeover bid that hasn\u2019t arrived, and maybe never will.",

      "body": "<p>It\u2019s a bit cheeky of Pete Redfern to bill <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/nov/14/most-renters-feel-theyre-unlikely-to-buy-home-in-next-five-years-review\">his report into the decline of home ownership</a> as \u201cindependent\u201d. He is chief executive of Taylor Wimpey, one of the country\u2019s biggest housebuilders, so he doesn\u2019t arrive on the scene free of commercial interests. Never mind. He was asked by the Labour party to lead the study and can\u2019t be blamed for accepting the gig. More to the point, his review isn\u2019t obviously stuffed with measures that would benefit builders of private homes.</p> <p>It does not, for example, recommend that the government should throw yet more subsidies at homebuyers in the manner of George Osborne, the chancellor who did so much to improve housebuilders\u2019 profits and share prices. Instead, the Redfern review says help-to-buy schemes are inflationary and should be restricted to first-time buyers seeking lower-priced homes. Quite right. Osborne\u2019s scattergun approach was wasteful.</p> <p>Nor is Redfern fixated with private homes. \u201cA fair housing market also needs both a healthy private rented sector and a supportive social housing sector,\u201d says the report. It\u2019s hard to disagree. For the past 30 years, governments\u2019 obsession with home ownership has deprived local authorities of the funds to build affordable properties for rent. The first step towards sanity must be support for all types of tenure. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/nov/14/most-renters-feel-theyre-unlikely-to-buy-home-in-next-five-years-review\">Most renters feel they're unlikely to buy home in next five years \u2013 review</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It cannot be said, however, that the report offers fresh insight into why home ownership fell 6.2 percentage points between 2002 and 2014. The chief finding is exactly as you would expect: fewer young people could afford to buy. House prices rose rapidly before the banking crisis; then credit constraints kicked in; and a constant driver was the decline in incomes of those aged 28 to 40 relative to older people. </p> <p>Redfern does have one novel suggestion, however: set up an independent housing commission, modelled on the new Infrastructure Commission, to provide long-term thinking on housing. This idea may feel like an intellectual cop-out but, at the core, there is a good point. Boosting the supply of new houses only makes a difference if higher volumes are sustained over the very long term, like a couple of decades. Since governments tend to be obsessed by short-term sticking plasters, an outside adviser-cum-enforcer might stand a better chance of success.</p> <p>It\u2019s Labour\u2019s report but Theresa May, also in search of a new housing policy, could consider pinching the commission idea. </p> <h2>EasyJet expansion will set Stelios spluttering</h2> <p>The explosion from Sir Stelios Haji-Ioannou hasn\u2019t been heard yet, but it may only be a matter of time. EasyJet, in the face of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/nov/15/easyjet-profits-fall-due-to-weak-pound-and-discount-flights\">a 28% fall in annual profits</a> and a 40% decline in the share price in the past 18 months, is stepping up its expansion. Capacity will be increased by 9% this year. The airline\u2019s founder, but merely 34% shareholder with his family these days, tends to hate any plan that carries the risk of flying with lots of empty seats. He may not be impressed.</p> <p>The case for the defence, however, is strong. Post-Brexit Brits will still want to take holidays in the Med, even if they know that eurozone-land will be pricier. Overall, the European short-haul market is expected to grow by 3.5% next year. Expanding at 9% may nevertheless appear rash but many of easyJet\u2019s competitors will do well just to stand still. So best to take advantage of the weaknesses of the likes of Monarch, Air Berlin and Air France-KLM. Adding capacity in Luton, where the airport is expanding anyway, and Venice, flight capital of a prosperous corner of northern Italy, doesn\u2019t look wildly aggressive.</p> <p>But, note, the benefits will only be felt in time. It may be several years before easyJet enjoys a vintage year like 2015 when pre-tax profits were \u00a3686m. The latest year, at \u00a3495m, looks a better short-term yardstick; revenues per seat, down 6.4%, will not bounce back quickly, and nor (one suspects) will the pound.</p> <p>The consolation for shareholders ought to be the dividend. Sir Stelios fought a long and successful campaign to force easyJet to be more generous. Now, in a harsher trading climate for all airlines, he can enjoy the fruits of a policy that mechanically sets payouts at 50% of post-tax earnings. For a long-term holder like him, that\u2019s not so bad.</p> <h2>Vodafone getting poor reception from investors</h2> <p>\u201cAny company that gives stuff away is not a company, it is a charity.\u201d So says Vittorio Colao, chief executive of Vodafone, who is miffed that India\u2019s richest man is offering telecoms services for free as a promotional stunt. The result is \u20ac6.3bn (\u00a35.5bn) writedown in the value of Vodafone\u2019s local operation in India and a reminder of the perils of expanding boldly in emerging markets.</p> <p>But it hardly explains why Vodafone\u2019s share price has fallen from 235p in August to 202p on Tuesday. The core European operation is finally looking perkier and forecasts for overall top-line profits are intact at \u20ac16bn-ish. Yes, debt is enormous but free cashflow covers a dividend that yields 6.2% in sterling terms. Maybe investors are just bored of waiting for a takeover bid that hasn\u2019t arrived, and maybe never will.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The cost of cake will soon be on the rise, Premier Foods, the maker of Mr Kipling and Cadbury cakes, has warned as it said the price of ingredients had shot up dramatically in the past few months. Gavin Darby, chief executive of the British company which owns a range of well-known brands, from Bisto gravy to Angel Delight, said the company was already talking to retailers about price rises in specific categories as the price of butter had soared 80%, while wheat and edible oils were up 40% from a combination of commodity price rises and currency exchange rate pressures. The price of sugar has also risen by between 20% and 30%. \u201cThat affects cake more than grocery products,\u201d Darby said. \u201cWe will have to look at it category by category ... A number of retailers have referred to justifiable and unjustifiable approaches from their suppliers. We feel by being very category-focused we will be much more justified.\u201d He said Premier would be looking at a number of strategies to mitigate cost rises including changing pack sizes, making its manufacturing and distribution systems more efficient, talking to its own suppliers, and reducing promotions. Richard Johnson, corporate affairs director, said: \u201cWe can\u2019t say there won\u2019t be any price increases, there probably will be next year, but we are very much in the camp of limited increases.\u201d He said passing on price rises to shoppers would be \u201cthe last resort\u201d. The price pressure on cake emerged as Premier revealed a 4% fall in underlying profits to \u00a326.3m in the six months to 1 October. Last month, Premier Foods said sales and profits were lower than expected in the last three months of that period after the exceptionally hot weather in September dampened customers\u2019 appetites for gravy and desserts. However, Darby said that he believed Premier was on track to meet sales targets for the year and had a competitive advantage because 89% of its expenditure was with UK suppliers and it manufactured 95% of its goods in the UK. It is therefore largely doing business in pounds and is less exposed to currency fluctuations. The company is also growing its export business and said that the drop in the value of the pound would help boost that. All major manufacturers supplying British retailers are facing significant increases in their costs after the 15% fall in the value of the pound since the Brexit vote has made it more expensive to source ingredients abroad. \u201cThis challenge [from the fall in sterling] is a bigger challenge for some of our competitors than Premier,\u201d said Darby. \u201cMany competitors produce in continental Europe and have to import finished goods, which is a much bigger issue. But we won\u2019t underestimate the challenge,\u201d he said. He added that Premier hoped to increase sales with a strong pipeline of new products including the launch of large Cadbury cakes and a ready-to-eat version of Batchelors Super Noodles, created with new partner Nissin, that could take on Pot Noodle.",

Matthew floats a scare story about hugely escalating costs of goods in the absence of free trade. Let me ask him this: would he support the free trade of goods produced by slaves, because it would make things even cheaper? I assume he wouldn\u2019t. But does he support those same goods being produced by people (often children, effectively in forced labour) paid pittances? Seemingly so, because that is the reality of much of current globalisation. Fair trade should be welcomed. It is innovative and efficient. But the unfettered free trade we have now, based largely upon who can pay least to those producing our goods, is not fair trade. It has run its course. It has failed almost everyone and it is time the left woke up to that fact and grabbed the initiative from the far right, who have been allowed to benefit from the legitimate anger and frustration of ordinary people. Mike Mosley Norwich \u2022 A key lesson we need to draw from Donald Trump\u2019s election is that toxic trade deals like the US-EU agreement TTIP are as unwanted in American society as in Europe. Trump cynically exploited public anger about these deals to win the US presidency. But we know, like Ukip here, that Trump is actually in favour of deregulation, privatisation and putting profit before people. His policies will not serve the interests of working-class communities, they will simply divide them and create the sorts of international tensions that, in previous times, sparked world wars. TTIP was killed off by a movement of ordinary people who believe in an open, equal and democratic society where diversity is embraced and everyone\u2019s rights are respected. We objected to TTIP because it would be bad for ordinary people and will hand power to big money \u2013 to businessmen like Donald Trump. We know that politicians are now fearful of opposing deals like Ceta \u2013 the EU-Canada deal which is currently making its way through the European parliament. This is exactly the wrong lesson to pull from Trump\u2019s election. To defeat the politics of racism and hatred represented by Trump and the far right in Europe, we call on politicians to support economic policies that will benefit the majority of people, eradicate poverty, create decent jobs and good public services and halt climate change. The first step politicians in Europe must take is to vote to stop Ceta in the coming weeks.

But Nafta, far from being a unilateral imposition by Washington, was a Mexican initiative, devised by the Salinas administration (1988-94), and concluded after long and arduous bilateral negotiations. While its regional and sectoral impact can be debated (mass Mexican migration to the north long antedated the agreement and, in recent years, net migration has in fact ceased), Nafta has, on balance, benefited Mexico, in part by codifying the economic relationship and curbing American unilateralism. Which is why Trump wants to tear it up and the Mexicans are justifiably worried.

      "bodyText": "The weaker than expected UK inflation figures have put pressure on the pound again, pushing it lower against the dollar and the euro. Sterling is currently down 0.4% at $1.2433 against the dollar, and the same amount lower against the euro at \u20ac1.1585. Meanwhile the dollar itself is on the rise after the latest US economic data - stronger than expected retail sales - pointed once more to an interest rate rise next month. On that note, it\u2019s time to close for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. Despite the Dow Jones Industrial Average slipping back after several days of gains, European markets ended the day in positive territory. The UK market was helped by weaker than expected inflation figures, which pushed back the chances of an interest rate rise from the Bank of England. Joshua Mahony, market analyst at IG, said: Stock markets rose once more today, as hopes of a high growth period based on substantial fiscal stimulus continued to stoke the embers of last week\u2019s US election... we have seen energy stocks grab some respite today, as crude prices rose in the wake of a fresh charge from OPEC to find a means to ensure the output cut comes to fruition. The final scores in Europe showed: The FTSE 100 finished up 39.56 points or 0.59% at 6792.74 Germany\u2019s Dax rose 0.39% to 10,735.14 France\u2019s Cac closed up 0.62% at 4536.53 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB was virtually unchanged, down just 0.02% at 16,682.37 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended up 0.33% at 8687.1 In Greece, the Athens market dipped 0.29% at 578.17 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 26 points or 0.14%. Elsewhere, crude has been buoyed by renewed talk that oil producers are trying to pave the way for an agreement on curbing output later this month. Brent crude is currently up 4% at $46.24 a barrel while West Texas Intermediate has jumped 4.4% to $45.24. Reuters has reported that Saudi energy minister Khalid al-Falih is expected to travel to Qatar this week for a meeting with producers. The outline of a deal to limit output was agreed by Opec in Algiers in September, but the details have proved difficult to agree. Not everyone is happy with Barack Obama\u2019s presence in Greece. Helena Smith reports: Thousands of protestors have taken to the streets in a mass display of opposition against Obama. Despite a government ban on protestors taking place during the 29-hour period the US president is expected to be in the Greek capital as many as 3,000 people, many communists and hardline leftists, have defied the order to gather in central Athens and march towards the US embassy. Some are carrying placards proclaiming \u201cunwanted,\u201d others decrying \u201ccapitalism and imperialism.\u201d Riot police have been dispatched with organisers, including Panaghiotis Lafazanis, the former energy minister and far left leader of the pro-drachma, breakaway Popular Unity party, denouncing the prohibition as \u201cillegal and provocative\u201d as Greece prepares to mark the November 17 anniversary commemorating the 1973 Polytechnic uprising against US-backed military rule. Here are Obama and Alexis Tsipras, courtesy of the White House, with the US president saying he would continue to urge Greece\u2019s creditors to take the steps needed to put the country on the path to a durable economic recovery: After six straight days of rises, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is pausing for breathe. It is currently down 26 points or 0.15%, but the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq both moved higher at the open. More from Obama on debt relief for Greece: And on Donald Trump\u2019s election victory: Greek prime minister Alexis Tsipras says he is hopeful Germany will back debt relief (which may be an heroic assessment): And here are Obama\u2019s comments. Helena reports: \u201cI have always wanted to come to Greece ... I think we all know that the world owes an enormous debt to Greece and the Greek people,\u201d Obama also told reporters. \u201cThe ideas of ancient Greeks helped inspire our founding fathers \u2026.to this day the United States is profoundly grateful to our Greek friends. \u201cI know this has been a painful and difficult time \u2026 this crisis is not an abstraction but has a very concrete and devastating impact on people in this country.\u201d It was, he said, now very important that \u201cGreeks see improvements in their daily lives.\u201d Back to Greece again, where the US president has begun his farewell tour of Europe. Our correspondent Helena Smith reports: Barack Obama may be visiting Athens at the end of his time in office but the outgoing US leader has not disappointed. Barely three hours after he touched down in a Greek capital rendered almost unrecognizable by draconian security, Obama said the three words Greek officials have wanted the world leader to utter: debt, austerity and solidarity. \u201cI will continue to underline that austerity alone cannot deliver prosperity,\u201d he told the Greek prime minister Alexis Tsipras after being greeted by the debt-stricken country\u2019s head of state and the rousing tones of a military honour band. \u201cDebt relief is needed.\u201d Earlier he had said: \u201cGreece has gone through very challenging and dramatic times over the last several years. We are glad to see that progress is being made, although we recognise that there are significant challenges ahead, and we intend to stand shoulder to shoulder with the Greek people throughout this process. \u201c Athens\u2019 leftist led government has made little secret that it hopes the US president\u2019s open display of support will resonate with Germany and other partners in Europe which have footed the bill of the nation\u2019s massive bailouts but demanded punishing belt-tightening in return. \u201cWe consider this visit will contribute to the effort to reduce Greece\u2019s debt, its spokesman said ahead of the leader\u2019s arrival. \u201cThe US president has repeatedly stated he wants to solve this huge issue before he leaves office.\u201d Obama, only the fourth American leader to visit the country since its foundation nearly 200 years ago, heads to Berlin once his 29-hour sojourn in Athens ends on Wednesday. Tsipras is pushing EU partners to agree to a debt deal by the end of the year. At around \u20ac330bn, or 180 percent of GDP, Greece\u2019s debt pile is not only regarded as unsustainable but perhaps the biggest impediment to its economic recovery. Without the load being partially forgiven, Tsipras\u2019 Syriza-dominated government says it will be high-nigh impossible to get out of the death spiral in which the recession-ravaged economy now finds itself. Obama, who also spoke of the importance of reforms in making the Greek economy more competitive, emphasized the significance of a \u201cstrong, prosperous and unified Europe \u2026 not just for the people of Europe but for the whole world and the US.\u201d This is the first time a sitting US president has elected to visit Greece on its own. On previous occasions Turkey has also been included in the tour. But Obama, who is accompanied by his Secretary of Treasury Jack Lew and Assistant Secretary of State for European and Eurasian Affairs Victoria Nuland, is believed to have wanted to make the trip for a long time. \u201cIt was a personal choice,\u201d said the defense minister Panos Kammenos speaking to a local radio station after welcoming the leader at Athens\u2019 international airport. The symbolism of Athens being the birthplace of democracy also played a significant role for a president now determined to allay the fears of European leaders following the election of his successor Donald Trump last week. At a press conference following 90-minute talks with Obama, the Greek prime minister said it was vital that Greeks began to feel the effects of the sacrifices they have made in recent years. \u201cAfter seven years the Greek people cannot bear any more austerity,\u201d he told reporters. \u201cGreece deserves debt relief and the time is now. President Obama and I discussed a number of issues specifically the important potential of investment in Greece and the future of Greece with its shipping power becoming an important centre for trade, transport and energy.\u201d But the signs of US economic strength question the need for any fiscal stimulus, says Dr Harm Bandholz, chief US economist at UniCredit Research: The consumption strength (and the related good performance of the US economy in the second half of 2016) has important policy implications. First, and most straightforward, it allows the Fed to stay on course for a rate hike at the upcoming meeting in mid-December. Second, and probably more controversial, it really questions the need for a massive fiscal stimulus at this point. After all, the idea of such a stimulus is to temporarily support the economy during downturns. There is a growing literature showing that fiscal multipliers are much smaller when the economy is close to potential or full employment. That means that one gets less bang for the buck. Moreover, as highlighted already by Milton Friedman, poorly timed policies add instability to the economy, potentially exacerbating rather than damping business cycles. They initially may cause overheating and higher inflation, and then a deeper recession. The strong US retail sales figures have only added to the expectation that the US Federal Reserve will raise interest rates in December. Rob Carnell, chief international economist at ING Bank, said a hike next month was almost in the bag: Strong US retail sales, and an expectation of further gains in inflation (due out on November 17) make the 92% market probability for a 14 December Fed rate hike look about right (nothing is 100% until it is done). Not only were headline retail sales figures strong at +0.8% month on month, but there were strong core figures (control group which strips out the more volatile items also rose 0.8% month on month). The figures were stronger than the consensus expected (+0.6% month on month), and stronger still when upwards revisions to the previous months\u2019 data are taken into account. The strength in sales was also matched with its breadth and only a few sub-categories registered month on month declines (furniture (-0.9% month on month, dept stores -0.7% month on month, and eating/drinking -0.7% month on month). While a December hike looks as close to a done deal as one ever gets in markets, there are still questions about 2017 Fed policy. Markets are currently optimistic about Trump\u2019s fiscal expansion in the US next year, and downplaying risks of a more deflationary protectionist policy mix. This might be right. That said, it places most of the risk on the downside, should expansion take longer to materialise than expected, or protectionism rear up more strongly than anticipated. While Mark Carney was delighting MPs by doling out party invitations, the US released better than forecast retail sales figures for October. According to the Commerce Department, retail sales rose 0.8% last month compared to September, with a particularly strong performance from the car industry. On top of that, building materials were also in demand, perhaps due to households hit by Hurricane Matthew having to rebuild and repair damage. The year on year rise was 4.3%. Analysts had forecast a month on month rise of 0.6% in October. Meanwhile September\u2019s figure was revised upwards from 0.6% to 1%. The combined gain in September and October was the biggest two month gain since early 2014. Mark Carney was on rather jolly form as he faced MPs today, perhaps happy that the issue of his term length was finally resolved last month. But what did we actually learn? 1) Central Banks are fighting their corner, as TrumpWorld approaches. Carney was repeatedly adamant that central bankers aren\u2019t responsible for the inequality and low growth that has helped to drive Donald Trump to power, and also helped to cause Brexit. He insisted that broader issues are in play, and only politicians can fight them, saying: I think it is very important to distinguish between the stance of monetary policy and the reasons why global interest rates are low, the reasons why inequality have increased across major economies. The last two are caused by much more fundamental factors and an excessive focus on monetary policy in many respects is a massive blame deflection exercise. Donald Trump argues that his tax cuts and infrastructure spending plans will actually have an effect here, creating the conditions for higher growth and borrowing costs. Carney may be offer his US counterpart, Janet Yellen, a lifeline -- given Trump\u2019s warning that he won\u2019t offer her a second term at the Fed. Central bank independence looks shaky; Carney is reminding us that central bankers have been clearing up quite a mess since 2008. 2) Carney won\u2019t be swayed to stay longer We can safely assume now that governor will flying back to Canada in July 2019 to be reunited with his family. Even if Brexit turns into a dogs dinner, and isn\u2019t finished by March 2019, Carney won\u2019t do more than the extra 12 months he signed up for. There is a practical reality, which is I\u2019ll be separated from my family for that extra period of extension so there are limits, reasonable limits to what that would be. I will leave June 30th 2019. 3) Don\u2019t get used to falling inflation Carney was reminded that inflation surprisingly fell this morning, to 0.9%. His message -- don\u2019t expect prices to remain low in 2017, given the pound\u2019s weakness. Inflation is going up. The pass through from a 20 percent fall in the trade weighted level of sterling is going to come,it\u2019s going to build towards the end of this year into 2017 and in our expectation, be above 2 percent by the middle of 2017 and stay there for a while because of that pass through. 4) Businesses are getting the Brexit jitters A Bank survey has found that 45% of Uk firms have seen their investment plans affected by Brexit; half of those companies have put spending plans on ice. And Carney also predicted that financial firms could start triggering their contingency plans when there is 18 months to go until Brexit, if they don\u2019t like the look of the new deal. He said: If the time to exit is measured in 18 months or less and the degree of exit is viewed as considerable then a number of those firms would take decisions, that\u2019s the best guidance I can give. 5) The Bank of England\u2019s Christmas Party will be a cracker Jacob Rees-Mogg MP has pushed for Mark Carney to get the sack, so it\u2019s nice to see that the two men have made up. The governor has invited one of his sternest critics to the Bank\u2019s swanky Christmas bash, along with the rest of the committee too (chairman Andrew Tyrie is planning to drag along a few officials too, so the Bank had better lay on extra nibbles). Mark Carney ends the meeting by returning to his theme that there is a \u201cblame exercise\u201d underway, with central banks being labelled as the only cause of problems in the economy today. He says that only politicians can really tackle inequality - his job is to help create economic stability and stable inflation. We\u2019re going to have to run exeptionally loose monetary policy We are going to continually make clear that we can\u2019t make the structural changes that will drive productivity. But he agrees it would be absolutely welcome to raise interest rates, when appropriate: And finally, Steve Baker tries to get himself swiftly dis-invited from the Bank of England Christmas party, by asking: Q: Have you lost the plot? MPC member Ian McCafferty denies it -- the bank acted on the best data possible after the Brexit vote, and have been responding to events first. Baker clarifies that he\u2019s actually quoting William Hague (former foreign secretary), who recently claimed that central bankers were pumping up a new bubble and keeping rates too low. Q: You have explained that unemployment would be higher if interest rates rise, so aren\u2019t you making \u201chighly political decisions\u201d? No, Carney insists. We\u2019re following our mandate (to maintain inflation around 2% in the medium term). And he then suggests that there\u2019s a dangerous theory that central bankers should thrown down a challenge to elected leaders: I do not accept the line of thought that central banks should not focus on their remit. They should tighten policy in order to force governments to take tough decisions. That\u2019s straying from the mandate. That\u2019s political. Q: Won\u2019t there be a huge crash when rates rise, having been left low for so long? Deputy governor Minouche Shafik argues that the Bank doesn\u2019t set the interest rate that the UK economy needs. And there would be \u201cvery big economic costs\u201d to pay if rates were raised now. Rees-Mogg asks whether the Bank\u2019s latest (more optimistic) economic forecasts will affect economic growth, in the same way that Mark Carney\u2019s statement immediately after the Brexit vote helped shore up confidence (in the bank\u2019s view, anyway) Tiptoeing carefully, Carney suggests that forecast changes don\u2019t have as much impact on consumers as actual interest rate changes (or commitments to act). Q: But if your forecasts are wrong, and are revised, that\u2019s a problem? Carney suggests that all forecasts are revised. Q: Yes, but it\u2019s hard to spot which part of the August forecast was right [the BoE slashed its 2017 growth forecast, and then revised it much higher in November]. Carney tries to stick to the big picture, saying that Britain is suffering a \u201cslow motion slowdown\u201d since the Brexit vote, not a sharp adjustment. Q: So should you watch out for groupthink in future? Carney says that the BoE\u2019s forecasts were too pessimistic about consumer spending; people did not react badly to the Brexit vote. The lesson learned is around the \u2018big turning point\u2019, he says. Finally, Jacob Rees-Mogg gets to question the Bank of England. Rees-Mogg is one of Mark Carney\u2019s toughest critics, and recently suggested the governor should resign for his comments before the Brexit vote. Everyone leans forward to hear what zingers Rees-Mogg will send down,.... Q: I must start by thanking you, governor, for inviting me to the Bank of England Christmas Party, it\u2019s very gracious, so thank you very much. Well, it is the season, grins Carney. Immediately, Steve Baker MP catches the governor\u2019s eye - perhaps keen on some canap\u00e9s and champers - and Carney finds himself inviting the whole committee along! Mark Carney has challenged politicians to implement \u2018major\u2019 structural economic reforms. Otherwise, we could be stuck with low interest rates for decades. Mark Carney says that only 4% of companies with a pension deficit say that current low interest rates are causing a problem. Q: But you at the Bank of England have just boosted the contributions into your own final salary scheme, says Helen Goodman. Carney doesn\u2019t like this very much - he says \u201ctotal compensation\u201d has been level-pegging with the public sector. Back in parliament, Helen Goodman MP challenges the Bank of England over its QE scheme. Q: By pushing down bond yields, you\u2019ve damaged defined benefit pension schemes and forced them to put more money to cover deficits, Minouche Shafik says this only affects schemes that are already in deficit, and most private sector firms have moved away from offering these final salary schemes. Goodman shoots back that firms aren\u2019t stopping these schemes because people don\u2019t like the security of final salary pension. They\u2019re stopping them because they\u2019re too expensive in the current financial environment. And because people are living longer, Shafik replies. Breaking away from Mark Carney.... over in Greece, president Barack Obama has arrived in Athens. Security is extra right in the Greek capital; there\u2019s a complete lockdown, with protests banned, public transport stopped, schools closed down,. Some 5,000 local police and over 300 US security agents participating in what is an unprecedented security cordon thrown around the capital. A gun ship is plying the waters south of Athens, and there\u2019s a drone flying overhead, says our correspondent Helena Smith. We\u2019ll have a full report shortly. In the meantime, here\u2019s how the day is playing out: Andrew Tyrie takes Carney back to the slump in sterling since the Brexit vote, and tries to get him to admit that a weak pound is a good thing. Q: Was the fall in the exchange rate welcome? It was necessary, Carney replies. The purchasing power of the currency has gone down by 20%, as part of the process of adjusting Britain\u2019s (whopping) current account deficit. (A better option would have been a surge in domestic productivity, of course, to drive up exports, but one can only dream....) Q: OK, but was the scale of the correction welcome? Future events will decide that, says Carney. Tyrie then reads out a quote from former BoE governor Mervyn King, who said recently that the fall in sterling was indeed welcome. Q: Do you welcome this intervention from your predecessor? I\u2019m aways keen to hear what Lord King has to say, straight-bats Carney, joking that his intervention was \u201cunnecessary but welcome\u201d. And he promises to keep a vow of silence once he leaves the BoE in June 2019. Economics professor Tony Yates thinks Carney should have batted questions about the weak pound out of the park: Mark Carney hands out a brief economics lesson, insisting that the relationship between the money supply and inflation is \u2018non-existant\u2019. Some of the MPs look unconvinced; maybe remembering Margaret Thatcher\u2019s zeal for monetarism (which encouraged her government to hike interest rates and trigger the deep recession of the early 80s). This theory may have won a Nobel Prize [for Milton Friedman], Carney says, but economics moves on. Carney says there\u2019s no \u2018precise number\u2019 that shows the limit of the Bank\u2019s tolerance for higher inflation (so no new forward guidance today!). It all depends why inflation is moving - including whether the public\u2019s inflation expectations have risen. He says that many retailers took our hedges against a falling pound, to protect them for six or 12 months, and they are trying to cut costs to limit future price rises. Carney says that inflation in October was lower than expected (as we covered this morning) mainly due to short-term effects in the clothing market. But... he insists that inflation is going to rise in the months ahead, as the weaker pound pushes up the price of imported goods. Boom! Mark Carney suggests that City firms could start executing plans to leave London in autumn 2017, if they are disappointed by the early shape of the government\u2019s Brexit deal. He tells the committee: If the time to exit is measured in 18 months, or less, and the degree of exit is considerable, then a number of firms will take decisions. \u2018Degree of exit\u2019 means hard, or soft Brexit -- ie, whether the financial services sector retains full access and membership of the single market. Q: What steps is Britain\u2019s financial sector taking for Brexit? Carney says that firms in the core of the financial sector, such as banks and insurance firms, are making contingency plans. But \u201cvery few of them are actually implementing contingency plans\u201d. And he urges business leaders to sit tight. As they follow those plans, hard decisions will be taken. But I would stress, to those firms, that it is very early days. So planning makes sense, action is in general precipitous. \u201cOur view is that it\u2019s still early days [for Brexit]\u201d, Mark Carney says. Article 50 hasn\u2019t been triggered yet, and we don\u2019t know if there will be a transition period afterwards. Wes Streeting MP takes Mark Carney into the details of Brexit. Carney says that the financial markets have taken a more downbeat view of Brexit than consumers. The scale and direction of the pound\u2019s decline shows that markets expect slower UK growth and a less open economy. And UK firms are adjusting to Brexit faster than expected in August. Carney says: For a little more than half of UK businesses, this is a non-issue But for 45%, Brexit is having some impact And for half of those fims, it is a notable impact -- they have shelved or delayed investment Sky News\u2019s Ed Conway makes an important point -- until this morning, we didn\u2019t know that former chancellor George Osborne had asked Mark Carney to serve three more years. John Mann: How can the Bank of England plan for Brexit when no-one knows what it will mean? We certainly don\u2019t know what the eventual shape of Brexit will be, agrees MPC member Michael Saunders. Q: So how can you be doing your job if you\u2019re not having regular updates from the government, and some indication over where Brexit is going? Carney suggsts there\u2019s no reason to panic. This is \u201call to play for\u201d, so we\u2019ve drawn up a central forecast based on the likelihood of events. And we are available for technocratic support to the government, if they need it. Mann then reveals that he\u2019s polled his constituents about Brexit; most of them want immigration controls to be part of the discussion, but only a small minority want to leave the single market, so.. Q: Surely you should be providing expert analysis of these options, and keeping us informed? The proper role for the MPC is to make its forecasts, and identify material risks to that forecasts, Carney replies. John Mann MP now challenges Mark Carney over the composition of his monetary policy committee. Q: Wouldn\u2019t a trade union economist being some much-needed industry experience, to help the Bank understand the economy. Carney says its not up to him to advise the government about MPC appointments. But he did meet with the TUC recently, so the Bank isn\u2019t ignoring trade unions. Andrew Tyrie jabs at Carney, suggesting he\u2019s uttering \u2018Delphic\u2019 words over forward guidance. The guidance is that there isn\u2019t any guidance, right? Yes, says Carney. But it\u2019s possible that a future Monetary Policy Committee could find themselves in a place where they might need forward guidance. (so the forward guidance is that there might be forward guidance one day) Conservative MP Kit Malthouse asks Mark Carney to explain the position with forward guidance (the governor\u2019s famous policy of pledging not to raise interest rates until the economy has reached a certain point). Carney gives a long explanation of forward guidance (which began by not promising to raise rates until unemployment fell below 7%). He says these pledges helped to underpin confidence and support the economy. But where is this forward guidance now, pleads Malthouse? It\u2019s very clear, it\u2019s not that difficult, says Carney (showing a small flash of impatience as he flicks through the latest quarterly inflation report). Look, it says here at the front that we now have a \u2018neutral stance\u2019 on interest rates. In other words, the next interest rate rise could be up or down. Malthouse still looks a bit baffled - but it\u2019s not really his fault. The Bank\u2019s policy is now to raise, or lower, rates depending on what the economy needs - which isn\u2019t exactly rocket science. Tyrie mischievously turns Carney\u2019s attention over the Atlantic, suggesting that Donald Trump and Theresa May share the same concerns over central banks. Q: Trump has been \u201cpretty critical of the Fed\u201d, hasn\u2019t he? The president elect has voiced some views on central banks, Mark Carney replies. But the issues facing the Fed and the Bank of England are different, so it\u2019s not a straight comparison. And Carney then lets rip at critics who blame central bankers for everything: It\u2019s very important to distinguish between the stance of monetary policy and the reasons why global interest rates are low, the reasons why inequality has increased across major economics. Those are caused by much more fundamental factors. And an excessive focus on monetary policy in many respects is a massive blame deflection exercise. Q: Do you think that the fact that central banks are responsible for such a huge range of activities today puts you in a position where you are more vulnerable to criticism, such as over Brexit? Carney plays this ball safely. He says it\u2019s \u201centirely appropriate and natural\u201d that central banks face more accountability today, as they have much wider responsibilities than in the past. Especially when monetary policy is playing such a big role in stimulating economies. Q: Did Theresa May\u2019s apparent criticism of central banks in her recent conference speech influence your decision to only serve another 12 months? No, Carney replies. Mark Carney denies that the uncertainty over his departure date has created uncertainty. There are \u201cfar bigger issues\u2019 in the UK economy, and the global economy, than my term lengths, he says. There may be, concedes Andrew Tyrie. There are, Carney insists! Mark Carney\u2019s grilling at the Treasury Committee is underway. Chairman Andrew Tyrie asks the Bank of England governor how much uncertainty has been caused by his decision to initially only serve five years, and then extend it by 12 months. Wouldn\u2019t it be better to keep governors to fixed terms of eight years? Carney says it is a great privilege and a great responsibility to serve at the Bank of England. He had planned to only do a five year term, but was then asked to do an extra three years. Q: So you were asked to extend it to eight years, but only chose to add on 12 months? Yes, says Carney. Q: What happens if the process of triggering article 50 takes longer than expected, and isn\u2019t complete by the end of June 2019 (when Carney\u2019s six-year term ends)? I have a family, Carney explains, and there are \u201creasonable limits\u201d to how long he can be separated from them (the governor\u2019s wife, Diane and their four daughters plan to return to Canada in 2018). Carney says he added one year to his term \u201cout of a sense of responsibility\u201d Theresa May has made it clear that she plans to trigger article 50 by March 2017, he says, so Britain should have left the EU by March 2019. But he won\u2019t speculate about hypothetical scenarios, and he doesn\u2019t want his departure date to be seen as a \u2018judgement\u2019 on the Brexit timetable. Tyrie won\u2019t let this lie, demanding to know.... Q: Are you definitely, irrevocably, leaving the bank in 2019? It sounds like you want to get rid of me, jokes Carney. And then he insists that he will indeed leave the BoE on 30 June 2019. While we wait for Mr Carney, there\u2019s time to flag up that UK house prices rose by 7.7% in the 12 months to September. That matches August\u2019s reading, with houses in the south of England driving the market up. Richard Snook, senior economist at PwC, says there are signs that the market may be cooling.... \u201cWe now have three months of post-Brexit official housing figures, which show price growth remaining robust, but fewer properties changing hands. At the start of the year, we expected slower house price growth, but in fact it has shown impressive resilience: in the first three quarters of the year average annual house prices were up by around 8% across the UK compared to the same period last year. \u201cBut high prices are causing some buyers to stay out of the market altogether. The ONS data show residential transactions in September were just 93,000, 11.3% lower than the previous year. This implies that underlying demand may be weakening as property becomes less and less affordable.\u201d Bank of England governor Mark Carney is due to give evidence to the Treasury Committee in parliament now, on the Bank\u2019s latest quarterly inflation report. There\u2019s a livefeed here. Newsflash from Brussels: the eurozone economy grew by 0.3% in the third quarter of this year, matching Q2\u2019s growth rate. Although Germany and France only grew by 0.2%, Italy expanded by 0.3% and the Netherlands and Spain both posted healthy growth of 0.7%. A string of economist are predicting that Britain\u2019s inflation rate will keep rising in the months ahead, despite dropping to 0.9% in October. Tom Stevenson, investment director for personal investing at Fidelity International, says \u201cThe expected rise in inflation paused for breath today as higher fuel prices were offset by slower rises in the price of clothes and university fees and cheaper hotel stays. \u201cAgainst all expectations, the CPI rose by just 0.9% in the year to October, slightly lower than September\u2019s 1% increase. However prices are still rising faster than at any time since late 2014. The rise in prices continue to be driven by sterling\u2019s recent weakness which has raised the cost of imported fuel and food. \u201cConsumers can expect UK inflation to continue rising into next year as the impact of the pound\u2019s slide continues to be felt. The conventional wisdom is that the Bank of England\u2019s 2% inflation target will be left behind in 2017. Jeremy Cook of World First, the currency exchange firm predicts sharp prices rises in 2017: In our estimates it will be the early part of the New Year that sees the majority of the price rises. Retailers are some of the smartest companies out there and they know it would be suicide to hike prices now pre-Christmas. Of course, the tightness of budgets in the retail environment means that any price rises are going to be painful \u2013 and low cost operators and discounters will be ready to pounce - but they will have to come or we will likely see additional seasonal and structural unemployment increases in 2017.\u201d Neil Wilson of ETX Capital is concerned by the jump in input prices (see earlier post) While inflation eased last month there is a ticking time bomb in the PPI data, which measures the costs of goods for manufacturers. And here there is a sign that much higher consumer inflation is on its way. The ONS data showed factory gate prices for goods produced by UK manufacturers rose 2.1% in the year to October 2016, which was a sharp jump from the 1.3% in the year to September 2016. Core input prices were up 9.9% in the year to October 2016, versus a rise of 5.1% in the year to September 2016. Howard Archer of IHS Global Insight agrees: We shouldn\u2019t get carried away by this inflation slowdown - it will surely only be temporary. The detail of today\u2019s report shows that Britain\u2019s CPI rate dipped last month because clothing prices had jumped sharply a year earlier, in October 2015. So there\u2019s a \u2018base effect\u2019, where last year\u2019s rise drops out of the calculations. The ONS explains: Clothing and footwear: the downward effect came mainly from garments (in particular women\u2019s outerwear), for which prices rose by 0.2% between September and October 2016, compared with a larger rise of 2.3% a year earlier. It is important to note that this followed a relatively large increase in prices in September 2016, which resulted in an upward contribution to the change in the rate of a similar magnitude to the downward effect seen in October. And it\u2019s also important to flag up that education hasn\u2019t suddenly become cheaper. It\u2019s just becoming less expensive at a slower rate. The ONS says: Education: charges, overall, rose by 2.0% between September and October this year compared with a larger rise of 3.6% between the same 2 months a year ago. The downward contribution came principally from UK and EU student tuition fees, where the impact from the rise in the cap for tuition fees (first introduced for new students in England in 2012) was smaller this year than in 2015. This was because nearly all students are already paying the higher rate of fees whereas last year the fees for fourth year courses rose to the higher rates. In addition there were more modest price increases for part-time and postgraduate fees compared with last year. On the other hand, transport costs have certainly pushed up. Motor fuel prices rose by 2.3% between September and October 2016. Today\u2019s figures also show that Britain\u2019s manufacturers are suffering from a hefty dose of inflation, due to the weak pound. Britain\u2019s Producer Prices index spiked by 4.6% in October - the biggest monthly rise on record. UK firms are suffering from the weakness in sterling since June\u2019s referendum, which is making raw materials and fuel much pricier. At present, retailers appear to be absorbing the cost rather than passing it onto consumers. But with imported goods prices surging, they may not be able to keep shop prices down for much longer.... This chart shows how Britain\u2019s CPI rate dipped, after jumping in September: This chart shows how clothing, recreation and educational all pulled inflation back: And this one shows how transport costs, including petrol, have jumped over the last year: The pound is falling sharply, as traders react to today\u2019s inflation report. Sterling has lost three-quarters of a cent, to $1.241 against the US dollar. They will be calculating that there\u2019s less chance of an early interest rate rise: The Office for National Statistics says cheaper clothing helped to drive the UK inflation rate down last month, countering a rise in fuel costs. The main downward contributors to the change in the rate were prices for clothing and university tuition fees, which rose by less than they did a year ago, along with falling prices for certain games and toys, overnight hotel stays and non-alcoholic beverages. These downward pressures were offset by rising prices for motor fuels, and by prices for furniture and furnishings, which fell by less than they did a year ago. Breaking! Britain\u2019s inflation rate has fallen! The consumer prices index only rose by 0.9% in October, new figures show, compared with 1.0% in September. That\u2019s a surprise; economists had expected CPI to rise to 1.1%. More to follow.... Here\u2019s Fiona Cincotta of City Index explaining why the bond market rout has taken a break this morning: The turmoil in the bond market appears to be pausing for breath, which is quite typical after the moves we have seen. The global bond market has sold off at an extraordinary rate since Trump won the presidential race 6 days ago and is currently on track for its worst monthly decline since 2003. Debt prices have fallen sharply as investors contemplate a world of higher inflation, increasing interest rate and political uncertainty, however this sell off is now showing signs of slowing. It almost seems ironic that Yellen &amp; co. have been trying to steepen the yield curve for years and yet Trump achieved it in a few days. The challenge is that if this can happen in conjunction with a strengthening economy, if achieved then it could be good news. However, apart from campaign rhetoric we still know very little about Trump\u2019s actual plans. The bond markets are calmer this morning, as investors take a breather after several days of falls. Government bond prices have recovered in early trading, pulling yields down from yesterday\u2019s highs. The UK 10-year gilt yield has dropped to 1.39%, from 1.43% last night [yields fall when prices rise] US Treasury bills have also clawed back some ground, having been sold off heavily since Donald Trump won the race to the White House (wiping out $1trn of value). These charts from Bloomberg TV show how yields have dipped this morning, but are much higher than a week ago: Good news from Italy! Its economy has returned to growth, with GDP expanding by 0.3% in the last quarter. That means the Italian economy has beaten expectations - and beaten Germany, whose 0.2% growth rate looks even more sluggish now. On an annual basis, Italy\u2019s economy was 0.9% larger than a year ago -- up from 0.7% in the second quarter. This is a much-needed boost for Matteo Renzi, as the prime minister faces a crunch referendum over constitutional reforms in December. Just in! The Netherlands has beaten Germany, by posting growth of 0.7% in the third quarter of the year: Economists are blaming Germany\u2019s slowdown on the impact of Britain\u2019s vote to leave the EU. The slump in the pound since June has made German goods less competitive in Britain, and also dented confidence across the global economy. So this would explain why exports fell between July and September, pulling German growth down to 0.2%. ING\u2019s Carsten Brzeski says the Brexit vote undermined Germany\u2019s economic strength: \u201cBrexit meets solid domestic economy. This is probably the best description of the German economic performance during the third quarter.\u201d Brzeski is also concerned that president-elect Trump could also hurt global trade: \u201cIf Germany\u2019s single most important trading partner, the U.S., really moves towards more protectionism, this would definitely leave its mark on German growth.\u201d DekaBank analyst Andreas Scheuerle hopes that German growth will bounce back in the October to December quarter: \u201cOne had expected a little more economic activity in the third quarter. But the signs for the final quarter are looking good. Europe\u2019s stock markets are mainly creeping higher this morning: Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 index has jumped by 46 point at the start of trading. Supermarket group Tesco has jumped by 3%, after new data shows sales growing at their fastest rate since 2013: Mining shares are leading the fallers, though, down at least 3%. That follows several days of gains, driven by the prospect of Donald Trump\u2019s plans to rebuild US infrastructure. Jeroen Blokland of Robeco Asset Management is also concerned that Germany\u2019s economy has faltered: Analysts at Citi reckon Germany\u2019s economy suffered from the shock of Britain\u2019s vote to leave the EU: Germany\u2019s weak performance may drag down the wider eurozone growth rate, which is published at 10am. Figures released earlier this month suggested euro area GDP expanded by 0.3%, but Holger Sandte of Nordea Markets fears that could be too optimistic. Here\u2019s ING\u2019s Carsten Brzeski: And Holger Zschaepitz of Die Welt shows how Germany\u2019s economy has slowed through the year. Bad news: Germany\u2019s economy has suffered a surprise slowdown, with growth halving in the last three months as foreign trade waned. The eurozone\u2019s largest economy only expanded by 0.2% in the third quarter of this year, figures just released show. That\u2019s down from 0.4% in April-June, and 0.7% in January-March. Economists had expected German GDP to rise by 0.3% in July to September. Statistics firm Destatis blamed a fall in exports for the slowdown, saying: Foreign trade had a downward effect on growth. Exports were slightly down while imports were slightly up compared with the second quarter of 2016. Household spending drove growth during the quarter. But companies also spent less on new machinery and equipment during the last quarter, although construction output rose. As this charts hows, year-on-year growth also fell sharply to 1.5%, from 3.1% in the second quarter. This means that Germany performed rather weaker than Britain, which grew by 0.5% in the quarter, or the US which expanded by 0.7% (or an annualised rate of 2.9%). Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial market, the eurozone and business. There\u2019s lots happening today, both in the financial world and the markets. At 9.30am, we get the latest UK inflation report. It\u2019s likely to show that the cost of living jumped again in October, to 1.1%, up from 1% in September, as the weak pound drive up import costs. Bank of England governor Mark Carney is then due before parliament\u2019s Treasury committee at 10am. This will be Carney\u2019s first appearance since he agreed to serve an extra year. Expect lots of questions about whether the Bank was too gloomy and alarmist about the Brexit vote, having raised its 2017 growth forecast. We get a new healthcheck on the eurozone economy this morning, with the first estimate of German (7am) and Italian GDP (9am) over the last quarter. We\u2019ll also be watching the bond markets closely, after prices fell sharply yesterday as investors anticipate higher inflation and growth once Donald Trump becomes US president. As Larry Elliott explains: Fears about the inflationary potential of Donald Trump\u2019s planned tax cuts and infrastructure spending have sent shock waves through the world\u2019s bond markets, as investors take fright at the prospect of higher than expected interest rates in the years ahead. Central banks are braced to suffer fresh losses on their vast holdings of government debt after the sell-off that saw $1tn wiped off the value of bonds last week intensified on Monday. Bond prices fell for a sixth day running in the UK, pushing the yield on government gilts to their highest level since the weeks leading up to the EU referendum, and US bond yields reached levels last seen in December 2015. Bond yields, the rate of interest an investor gets, rise when bond prices go down. But Trump isn\u2019t in the White House yet (!) Barack Obama is still at the helm, and he\u2019s visiting Greece on his final tour of Europe before his term expires. He\u2019s expected to call for Greece to receive debt relief, to give its people fresh hope as their long austerity drive continues. Athens is already under a serious lockdown, with all protests banned while Obama meets with Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras and President Prokopis Pavlopoulos. And in the corporate world, mobile giant Vodafone, commercial property group Land Securities, budget airline easyJet, food manufacturer Premier Foods and cinema group Cineworld are reporting results.",

After all, the idea of such a stimulus is to temporarily support the economy during downturns. There is a growing literature showing that fiscal multipliers are much smaller when the economy is close to potential or full employment. That means that one gets less bang for the buck. Moreover, as highlighted already by Milton Friedman, poorly timed policies add instability to the economy, potentially exacerbating rather than damping business cycles. They initially may cause overheating and higher inflation, and then a deeper recession.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-582b17b8e4b0eb4ebf2744bb\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-11-15T14:36:11.276Z\">2.36pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The strong US retail sales figures have only added to the expectation that the US Federal Reserve will raise interest rates in December. Rob Carnell, chief international economist at ING Bank, said a hike next month was almost in the bag:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Strong US retail sales, and an expectation of further gains in inflation (due out on November 17) make the 92% market probability for a 14 December Fed rate hike look about right (nothing is 100% until it is done).</p> <p>Not only were headline retail sales figures strong at +0.8% month on month, but there were strong core figures (control group which strips out the more volatile items also rose 0.8% month on month). The figures were stronger than the consensus expected (+0.6% month on month), and stronger still when upwards revisions to the previous months\u2019 data are taken into account.</p> <p>The strength in sales was also matched with its breadth and only a few sub-categories registered month on month declines (furniture (-0.9% month on month, dept stores -0.7% month on month, and eating/drinking -0.7% month on month).</p> <p>While a December hike looks as close to a done deal as one ever gets in markets, there are still questions about 2017 Fed policy. Markets are currently optimistic about Trump\u2019s fiscal expansion in the US next year, and downplaying risks of a more deflationary protectionist policy mix. This might be right. That said, it places most of the risk on the downside, should expansion take longer to materialise than expected, or protectionism rear up more strongly than anticipated. </p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e36e589cd8c9988b333e4ca458006b2fc28e9339\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e36e589cd8c9988b333e4ca458006b2fc28e9339/0_295_5175_3106/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Interest rate rise on the cards after strong US retail sales\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Interest rate rise on the cards after strong US retail sales</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bebeto Matthews/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-582b1563e4b05c05c52f5441\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-11-15T14:21:32.028Z\">2.21pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">US retail sales stronger than expected</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>While Mark Carney was delighting MPs by doling out party invitations, the US released better than forecast retail sales figures for October.</p> <p>According to <strong><a href=\"http://www.census.gov/retail/index.html\">the Commerce Department,</a></strong> retail sales rose 0.8% last month compared to September, with a particularly strong performance from the car industry.

      "bodyText": "Bank of Cyprus is to list on the London Stock Exchange and expand in the UK, in the latest sign of its path towards rehabilitation since savers were forced to take losses to pump billions of euros into its bailout three years ago. Under John Hourican, a former senior executive at Royal Bank of Scotland who left during the Libor rigging crisis, Bank of Cyprus has undergone a radical restructuring and repaid all but \u20ac800m (\u00a3690m) of \u20ac11.4bn emergency liquidity assistance used to keep it afloat at the peak of the island\u2019s economic meltdown. The Mediterranean island was at the heart of the eurozone crisis in 2013 when a rescue deal for Bank of Cyprus \u2013 its biggest lender \u2013 was a key part of measures need to keep the country inside the single currency area. Laiki, or Cyprus Popular Bank, was closed and its smaller depositors placed in Bank of Cyprus, which in turn imposed losses on savers holding deposits more than \u20ac100,000, many of whom were said to be Russian. It was first bank in the eurozone to take a slice of customers\u2019 savings as part of the international \u20ac10bn bailout of the island to avoid recourse to taxpayers. Hourican, who is Irish, tried to leave last year but was convinced to stay on by veteran banker Josef Ackermann, who became chairman of Bank of Cyprus in 2014 when it received a capital injection from a group international investors led by private equity billionaire Wilbur Ross. Ackermann is a former chief executive of Deutsche Bank, itself mired in financial difficulties. An attempt at a London listing is a high-profile move for Hourican, who told parliamentarians after the RBS \u00a3290m Libor fine that he had told colleagues \u201cthey should not waste my death\u201d and clean up the culture of the bank. He was described by Andrew Tyrie MP as a \u201chuman shield\u201d for others at RBS. Hourican has sold off Bank of Cyprus\u2019s Russian arm and scaled back its other international operations but intends to expand in the UK, where there already four branches. The aim is to target the professional buy-to-let market and small business customers, entrepreneurs and Cypriots living in the UK. The London-based arm is covered by the UK deposit scheme, the Financial Services Compensation Scheme, which covers the first \u00a375,000 of savings. To facilitate the listing in London \u2013 through which Bank of Cyprus does not intend to raise fresh funds \u2013 a holding company will be set up in Ireland so that it meets the standards to allow it to be included in the FTSE series of stock market indices. It will remain listed in Cyprus but delist from Athens. At the time of the bank\u2019s half-year results in August, Hourican described in a Bloomberg interview how the bank and the country had experienced a \u201csignificant cardiac arrest\u201d when he took over. As the bank reported \u20ac120m on pre-tax profits for the first nine months of 2016, Hourican said customer deposits had increased 10%. \u201cWe remain focused on operating as an accelerator for growth in the real Cypriot economy,\u201d he said.",

The most important thing about forward guidance is that the underlying economic determinants should be correct, not that it should be helpful.\u201d Andrew Tyrie, the committee chair, stepped in to try to clarify matters. \u201cSo what you\u2019re saying is that though the forward guidance might not make sense now, it might do at some point in the future?\u201d Mogadon Mark flashed one of his expensive smiles, but resisted the temptation to spell things out in black and white. Why couldn\u2019t the committee understand that there was no point in him giving accurate forward guidance, because then there would be no chance for him to come back and revise that guidance in future forward guidance? Labour\u2019s John Mann was keen to find out if the Bank had an inside track on the government\u2019s Brexit policy. Mogadon Mark shook his head. \u201cSo you\u2019re as much a bystander in all this as the rest of us,\u201d observed Mann. \u201cBasically, when you put it that way, yes,\u201d Mogadon Mark replied. \u201cSo while the prime minister is doing nothing, you\u2019re being kept at arm\u2019s length,\u201d Mann said. \u201cDo you think there\u2019s a case for parliament to widen your remit so that you can inform us of the consequences of different plans of action?\u201d A look of horror crossed Mogadon Mark\u2019s face. There was nothing he would like less than to have his remit widened. Once bitten, twice shy. If the government was going to screw up Brexit, he didn\u2019t want his perfectly manicured fingerprints anywhere near the mess. Let them take the rap. Labour\u2019s Rachel Reeves pressed him on this. Even if the government were to decide on its objectives for Brexit, it couldn\u2019t guarantee to deliver on them, so would he not consider drawing up some risk scenarios? \u201cPeople are crying out for more information,\u201d she said. \u201cMe too,\u201d Mogadon Mark shrugged. In the meantime, he was just keeping on keeping on. What do they know of economics who only economics know? \u201cCan you explain why inflation was not as high last month as you expected?\u201d Reeves continued. \u201cIt\u2019s the footwear situation,\u201d he answered. Noticing the blank faces staring back at him, Mogadon Mark talked them through it. October had been warmer than usual, so people hadn\u2019t needed to go out and buy new shoes. And, yup, the British economy was so fragile that one month of nobody buying shoes could massively distort the inflation figures. \u201cBut don\u2019t worry,\u201d he said, confidently. \u201cI\u2019ve checked the weather forecasts and inflation is going to shoot up next month.\u201d Visibly reassured, the committee moved on to the slump in the pound. \u201cWas the fall in the exchange rate welcome?\u201d asked Tyrie. \u201cIt was necessary,\u201d Mogadon Mark replied. \u201cBut was it welcome?\u201d Tyrie pressed. \u201cIt was necessary,\u201d Mogadon Mark deadpanned again. \u201cCan you think of anything that is necessary but unwelcome?\u201d the chair asked.

    "webTitle": "Mark Carney: political attacks on central banks are a deflection exercise", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The governor of the Bank of England has hit back at accusations by politicians in the US and UK that central banks have increased inequality, saying such allegations are a \u201cmassive blame-deflection exercise\u201d. Mark Carney told the Treasury select committee that any increases in the gap between rich and poor were the result of structural changes in western economies that could only be tackled by politicians and could not be blamed on low interest rates. The Tory MP Steve Baker asked Carney how he reacted to accusations from Theresa May that low interest rates were hindering the recovery and increasing inequality by crippling individual savers and encouraging property speculation, helping the rich get richer. Donald Trump has also taken aim at the US Federal Reserve, arguing that interest rates must return to levels seen before the 2008 crash, which rewarded saving. Carney, who confirmed he will remain governor until 2019, said the economy needed low interest rates while productivity remained weak and business investment low. House prices were pushed higher by the lack of supply, he said. \u201cAn excessive focus on monetary policy in many respects is a massive blame-deflection exercise. We can\u2019t make the structural decisions that change the path of productivity. Monetary policy doesn\u2019t drive fundamentals,\u201d he said. Answering accusations that central bank policies were depressing household incomes and fuelling populism, he said: \u201cThere is a school of thought that central banks should tighten policy to force governments to take tough decisions. That would be political.\u201d Carney also warned that a hard Brexit remained a real threat to the City and could push banks to shift operations to foreign financial centres. He said banks could start to relocate activities before the end of 2017 if the government begins the article 50 divorce process in March as promised. Banks and insurers were already making contingency plans in case Britain loses a lot of its access to the EU\u2019s single market, he said, and if a hard Brexit is likely, \u201ca number of those firms would take decisions [to leave], that\u2019s the best guidance I can give\u201d. In a signal that relocation plans are being drawn up, Germany\u2019s finance ministry said it has been fielding an increasing number of requests for information since the summer from financial institutions in Britain considering a move to the EU\u2019s largest economy. Several Bank of England officials appeared with Carney before a sometimes hostile group of MPs to defend their record since the Brexit vote. The Bank recently revised up its GDP growth forecasts to 2.2% for 2016 and 1.4% in 2017 after the economy recovered strongly from the Brexit vote. But it slashed its projections for 2018 to 1.5% from 1.8%, giving a gloomy outlook for households, which it said would suffer higher unemployment and soaring inflation that would knock their spending power. Tory MP Jacob Rees-Mogg asked Carney why, when the Bank\u2019s forecasts \u201cwere so wrong\u201d, he had failed to support monetary policy committee member Ian McCafferty, who said the UK was more robust than Threadneedle Street\u2019s forecasts predicted and refused to back some measures to ease credit further. \u201cI listened to Mr McCafferty carefully,\u201d said Carney. \u201cThe forecast is the judgment of the whole committee. It was our best judgment and we had a much higher growth forecast that most. We did aim off the surveys, but [the Brexit vote] hasn\u2019t affected the consumer and the housing market as much as we expected.\u201d The governor also replied to MPs\u2019 concerns that the MPC might be out of touch with regional businesses. Carney said MPC members and the Bank\u2019s regional agents were in close contact with leaders of small, medium and large businesses, adding that he personally toured the country once a year. He pointed to a recent Bank survey that found that about 45% of businesses had shelved or delayed investments following the referendum. However, a little more than half of the UK businesses polled said Brexit was a \u201cnon-issue\u201d. \u201cSo they\u2019re not adjusting based on the twists and turns of the Brexit process, either they\u2019re entirely domestically focused or they\u2019re focused on third country export markets. And in fact if they\u2019re the latter type of business, the adjustment in the exchange rate is obviously a positive development and they\u2019re moving forward,\u201d he said, referring to the near 20% drop in sterling against the US dollar since the referendum.",

      "bodyText": "Sir Richard Branson on Tuesday heralded the rebirth of supersonic passenger flights with the unveiling of a prototype aircraft promising 3.5-hour flights from London to New York for an \u201caffordable\u201d $5,000 return. The billionaire Virgin Group founder said his Spaceship company would help Denver-based startup Boom build a new generation of supersonic jets and reintroduce transatlantic flight times unseen since Concorde was scrapped. \u201cI have long been passionate about aerospace innovation and the development of high-speed commercial flights,\u201d Branson said. \u201cAs an innovator in the space, Virgin Galactic\u2019s decision to work with Boom was an easy one. We\u2019re excited to have an option on Boom\u2019s first 10 airframes. Through Virgin Galactic\u2019s manufacturing arm, the Spaceship Company, we will provide engineering and manufacturing services, along with flight test support and operations as part of our shared ambitions.\u201d Branson is partnering with Blake Scholl, a pilot and former Amazon executive, who will later on Tuesday unveil a prototype of the new jet in a hangar in Denver, Colorado. While several other companies, including Boeing and Lockheed Martin, are developing new supersonic jets, Scholl said his plan was likely to beat them to market as it does not require any new technology that would need approval by regulators. Scholl said test flights would begin in southern California, with plans to launch the first commercial departures in 2023. If the plans stick to schedule, Boom flights will launch 20 years after British Airways and Air France decommissioned Concorde. He said Boom would succeed where Concorde failed because developments in technology and lighter materials meant tickets would be much cheaper. \u201cSixty years after the dawn of the jet age, we\u2019re still flying at 1960s speeds,\u201d Scholl, the founder and CEO of Boom, said. \u201cConcorde\u2019s designers didn\u2019t have the technology for affordable supersonic travel, but now we do. Today, we\u2019re proud to unveil our first aircraft as we look forward to our first flight late next year.\u201d Scholl said tickets would cost \u201cabout the same as tickets in business class\u201d. \u201cI don\u2019t know a single person who wouldn\u2019t want to get there in half the time, rather than have some free champagne,\u201d he said. \u201cIt won\u2019t be a bucket-list purchase any more. There is a huge market and the margins are enormous.\u201d Boom will have just 45 to 50 seats, compared with Concorde\u2019s 92 to 128. Scholl reckons the demand for affordable supersonic flights could make this a $100bn market. He said his plane could work on 500 different routes, but would concentrate initially on London to New York, San Francisco to Tokyo, and Los Angeles to Sydney. Scholl declined to state how much money Virgin had pumped into the venture, but listed a dozen well-known Silicon Valley venture capital firms and angel investors who had invested funds. \u201cI started this because I was sad that I never got to fly on Concorde. I waited but no one was doing it, so I decided to,\u201d Scholl said. \u201cUltimately I want people to be able to get anywhere in the world in five hours for $100. To get there you have to improve fuel efficiency, but step-by-step supersonic air travel will become available for everyone. \u201cThis is supersonic passenger air travel, no bullshit, and it\u2019s actually affordable.\u201d This article was amended on 15 November 2016.

      "bodyText": "Reynolds American is reported to have rejected British American Tobacco\u2019s $47bn (\u00a338bn) takeover bid and told the UK company to return with a higher offer. The companies have been in talks since BAT announced its offer on 21 October, in a move that would create the world\u2019s biggest publicly traded tobacco company and put BAT back in the US after a 12-year absence. Discussions are continuing and BAT is prepared to increase its offer slightly, according to Bloomberg. BAT has said Reynolds shareholders will gain from the deal by owning a stake in a bigger company with the clout to sell brands around the world. BAT, whose brands include Lucky Strike and Benson &amp; Hedges, owns 42.2% of Reynolds and is offering to buy the remainder of the company, whose origins predate the American war of independence. The British company has owned a stake in the maker of Camel and Newport cigarettes since 2004, when it merged its US subsidiary, Brown &amp; Williamson, with RJ Reynolds Tobacco to create Reynolds American. Speculation had brewed for months that BAT might decide to buy out Reynolds as tobacco companies jockey for position amid declining smoking rates and increased regulation. US population growth has kept the number of smokers at about 45 million for several decades. BAT\u2019s $56.50 a share offer in cash and shares was worth 20% more than Reynolds\u2019 closing price before the bid was revealed and valued the US company at about \u00a366bn. BAT has said it will pursue the takeover only if it has the support of Reynolds\u2019 board. The UK company was forced to reveal its offer because its large stake in Reynolds compelled it to go public under US law. The combined firm would be worth about \u00a3146bn and would overtake Philip Morris as the biggest public tobacco company. As well as securing a place in the US market, BAT would acquire Reynolds\u2019 leading position in electronic cigarettes. BAT shares, which have fallen 10% since it announced its offer for Reynolds, were little changed at \u00a342.91 in early afternoon trading on Tuesday. A BAT spokesperson declined to comment.",

      "bodyText": "Aldi and Lidl have sunk to their slowest growth rate since 2011 as Tesco almost doubled its pace of expansion. The UK\u2019s biggest supermarket gained market share for the second month in a row as sales rose by 2.2% in the 12 weeks to 6 November, up from 1.3% reported last month, making it the only one of the big four chains in growth, according to the latest data from Kantar Worldpanel. Tesco increased market share to 28.2%, up from 27.9% a year ago. Aldi and Lidl continued to be the fastest expanding grocers in the market. But their growth slid to 11.4% and 8.4% respectively, according to Kantar. Some analysts believe sales in the chains\u2019 established stores are flat or even down on last year. Fraser McKevitt, head of retail and consumer insight at Kantar, said the discounters were being hit as they were now up against very strong rates of growth a year ago, while Tesco\u2019s resurgence had made life more difficult. He said Tesco was selling bigger volumes of fresh meat and produce after cutting prices and introducing its cheaper own-label Farm Brands ranges. Its premium Tesco Finest range also increased by 6% over the period. UK discounter Iceland, which had previously been under pressure from the rise of its German rivals, has also found a way to fight back more effectively. Its sales were up 8.3% as increased seafood ranges and tie-ups with Slimming World and Pizza Express paid off. Meanwhile, action by Tesco, Asda, Morrisons and Sainsbury\u2019s to cut prices has drawn the discounters into the price war. \u201cAldi and Lidl haven\u2019t let their price differential [to the major supermarket chains] slip and so they have been cutting prices which has slowed their growth down,\u201d said McKevitt. The price war prompted yet another month of deflation, with prices across the market down an average 0.5%. However that is the slowest pace of deflation since October 2014. and McKevitt said: \u201cWe\u2019re likely to see inflation in December.\u201d Mike Watkins, UK head of retailer and business insight at analysis firm Nielsen, which also found that Aldi and Lidl had slipped to its slowest pace of growth since 2011, said grocers had yet to see any impact from Brexit. \u201cShoppers are still spending freely and we\u2019ve seen a return of sustainable growth in the volume of items people are buying, helped by industry-wide price cuts,\u201d he said.",

The company sold a terminal in San Jose belonging to its Greyhound division for \u00a321.6m, and Shore Capital\u2019s Martin Brown said: Greyhound has large city centre terminals all over North America and while difficult to assess, we believe there is significant real estate value tied up with the Greyhound network, something that we believe the market continues to overlook. The \u00a321.6m sale price compares favourably to our full year March 2017 operating profit forecast of \u00a337.1m for Greyhound. The company pointed to a \u201csignificantly improved\u201d cash performance in the six months to the end of September, but profits slipped by 2.2% to \u00a321.9m as a good performance in the US was offset by difficult conditions in the UK. And despite the improved cash position, analysts at Jefferies pointed to a growing pension deficit: The big increase in pension deficit to \u00a3498m (excluding Rail) from \u00a3270m in March may initially be overlooked but should be seen as an offset to headline cash messages, in our view.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "EasyJet suffered a sharp fall in annual profits \u2013 its first decline in six years \u2013 and expects a further drop this year after the budget airline was hit by the weak pound and was forced to cut prices. Currency movements cost the company \u00a388m as the pound\u2019s fall against the dollar increased fuel costs. The company said unexpected events such as increased competition, terrorist attacks, airport strikes and higher holiday expenses for British customers cost it \u00a3150m. Pre-tax profit for the year to the end of September dropped 27.9% to \u00a3495m, at the top of the company\u2019s guidance, on flat revenue of \u00a34.7bn. The company cut its dividend by 2.5% to 53.8p. City analysts expect profit to fall again this year to \u00a3405-410m and the company said it had no reason to encourage them to lift forecasts. Carolyn McCall, easyJet\u2019s chief executive, said the company\u2019s performance was \u201cresilient\u201d in a difficult market for all airlines. McCall said: \u201cI think we are still very successful and that is what is important to convey. Half a billion of profit in a time of external challenges and upheaval is an extraordinary performance for an airline. We are a very successful airline and strong airlines get stronger at times like this.\u201d EasyJet shares, which have fallen 40% this year, rose 3% to \u00a310.62 in late morning trading. McCall, who has run easyJet since mid-2010, said the pound\u2019s decline had affected easyJet more than its rivals because the company reports in sterling. EasyJet said the weak pound would affect next year\u2019s results, reducing annual profit by about \u00a390m. Like Michael O\u2019Leary, the boss of low-cost rival Ryanair, McCall said fares would continue to fall for a fourth straight year amid economic and political concerns. But she said easyJet\u2019s long-term prospects were good because people are flying more and inefficient established airlines cannot match budget carriers\u2019 prices. \u201cThe fundamentals of European short-haul aviation haven\u2019t changed. Low-fare, low-cost models are the winners. Ryanair and easyJet \u2013 both of them will win. We are competing with the legacy carriers.\u201d McCall said airlines such as Air France-KLM had gained some breathing space from ultra-low oil prices, which encouraged them to fly more planes, putting pressure on air fares, but that as oil rises those carriers will find trading tough. She said at least seven terrorist incidents during the year, including attacks on Belgium and France, had made people wary of flying, prompting fare cuts. \u201cThe demand environment is there but it has needed a lot of stimulation, particularly in France, as you would expect \u2026 From the consumer\u2019s perspective it\u2019s an absolutely brilliant time to be booking leisure or business.\u201d McCall said she was not worried by persistently low fares because easyJet was designed for low prices and was selling more add-ons such as rental cars, hotels and in-flight extras. EasyJet increased seat capacity by 6.5% last year and flew 73.1 million passengers, up from 68.6 million the year before. Profit per seat fell to \u00a36.19 from \u00a39.15. It will increase capacity by 9% this year, including in the UK, where it is the biggest airline, and in France. McCall said she did not expect Britain\u2019s departure from the EU to disrupt easyJet\u2019s operations. It will apply for an air operator certificate in another EU country where some planes will be registered but the company is keeping its head office at Luton airport, where it has been based since it was founded 20 years ago. \u201cOur headquarters would remain in Luton and the jobs we have in Luton would remain in Luton.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "On a busy day for corporate and economic news, leading shares have turned their attention away - briefly - from the shock Donald Trump victory in the US election. The FTSE 100 is currently up 60.05 points at 6813.23, while the pound is on the slide after weaker than expected UK inflation figures dampened the prospects of a Bank of England rate rise in the near future. Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at IG, said: An unexpected drop in UK prices has sent the pound into freefall again versus the dollar, which has meant that the FTSE 100 is enjoying the benefits of a weaker currency. The fall in both headline and core price growth will have caught many by surprise, but a steady rise in producer prices signals that weakness in consumer prices may not last for ever. Supermarkets are in demand after overall grocery sales rose in the 12 weeks to November 6, according to Kantar Worldpanel, although the individual pattern was mixed. Tesco, up 7.35p to 213.2p, saw sales grow at their fastest rate in three years while Morrisons, 8.4p better at 221p, reported a 2.4% fall, which reflected some store closures. Elsewhere pharmaceutical group Hikma is 66p higher at \u00a316.90 after a positive note from Morgan Stanley. The bank put an overweight rating on the business with a \u00a322 price target, saying: Lack of pipeline visibility has been our main concern. Our new deep dive into Hikma\u2019s medium term pipeline and long term opportunities gives us increased confidence. While it doesn\u2019t change the near term trajectory, it points to a pathway for sustained growth and should lead to a multiple re-rating. Our estimate of a $600m generic pipeline brings clarity. We have uncovered what we believe to be 70% of Hikma\u2019s filed pipeline. Clarity on the nature and timing of projects removes a key overhang. Hikma\u2019s acquisition of Roxane was not only for its pipeline, but also its legal and R&amp;D expertise, which helps position Hikma to deliver and enter a higher value add market. We worked our way down from the 800+ drug list of pending generic filings and found that Hikma is well placed to capitalise long term. A third of this list are Central Nervous System drugs, an area the company has expertise in. We estimate a further combined value of $750m comes from scheduled and extended release drugs, two areas Hikma has been explicit in targeting. While we do not know if Hikma is behind these specific filings, these areas represent the generic opportunity set where Hikma is well placed and likely to pursue, providing a healthy LT pipeline. With Hikma trading at 15 times 2017 estimated earnings, a substantial discount to history, we see limited downside near-term. The stock has underperformed by 19% over the past 3 months; we see upside as we view the stock as oversold. Land Securities has been lifted 33p to \u00a310.18 following a lower than expected fall in net asset value, a 4.5% rise in revenue profit - although it fell into a \u00a395m pretax loss after property revaluations - and comments that it was \u201crelatively insulated\u201d against any weakness in the property market following the \u201cuncharted territory\u201d after the Brexit vote. Tobacco group BAT is 26p better \u00a343.07 despite reports that US target Reynolds had rejected its $47bn bid. But mining shares have lost ground after their recent gains, with Antofagasta falling 40.5p to 665.5p and Rio Tinto down 130p at 3015.5p. The sector had been boosted by hopes of increased demand if Trump fulfils his pledge to boost US infrastructure spending. Among the mid-caps, TalkTalk is down 10.8p at 190.3p following its figures, while biotech group BTG has lost 27p to 619p despite a 24% rise in half year revenues. Analysts said foreign exchange movements had hit earnings, with Jefferies saying: Management envisages a \u00a325m full year charge for losses on foreign exchange forward contracts, which is not included within our current \u00a3123m adjusted pretax profit forecast. Following expiry of most foreign exchange contracts the full benefits of a weaker pound should benefit profits from 2018.

      "body": "<p>On a busy day for corporate and economic news, leading shares have turned their attention away - briefly - from the shock Donald Trump victory in the US election.</p> <p>The<strong> FTSE 100</strong> is currently up 60.05 points at 6813.23, while the pound is on the slide after weaker than expected UK inflation figures dampened the prospects of a Bank of England rate rise in the near future. Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at IG, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>An unexpected drop in UK prices has sent the pound into freefall again versus the dollar, which has meant that the FTSE 100 is enjoying the benefits of a weaker currency. The fall in both headline and core price growth will have caught many by surprise, but a steady rise in producer prices signals that weakness in consumer prices may not last for ever. </p> </blockquote> <p>Supermarkets are in demand after overall grocery sales rose in the 12 weeks to November 6, according to Kantar Worldpanel, although the individual pattern was mixed. <strong>Tesco</strong>, up 7.35p to 213.2p, saw sales grow at their fastest rate in three years while <strong>Morrisons</strong>, 8.4p better at 221p, reported a 2.4% fall, which reflected some store closures.</p> <p>Elsewhere pharmaceutical group <strong>Hikma</strong> is 66p higher at \u00a316.90 after a positive note from Morgan Stanley. The bank put an overweight rating on the business with a \u00a322 price target, saying:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Lack of pipeline visibility has been our main concern. Our new deep dive into Hikma\u2019s medium term pipeline and long term opportunities gives us increased confidence. While it doesn\u2019t change the near term trajectory, it points to a pathway for sustained growth and should lead to a multiple re-rating.</p> <p>Our estimate of a $600m generic pipeline brings clarity. We have uncovered what we believe to be 70% of Hikma\u2019s filed pipeline. Clarity on the nature and timing of projects removes a key overhang. Hikma\u2019s acquisition of Roxane was not only for its pipeline, but also its legal and R&amp;D expertise, which helps position Hikma to deliver and enter a higher value add market. </p> <p>We worked our way down from the 800+ drug list of pending generic filings and found that Hikma is well placed to capitalise long term. A third of this list are Central Nervous System drugs, an area the company has expertise in. We estimate a further combined value of $750m comes from scheduled and extended release drugs, two areas Hikma has been explicit in targeting. While we do not know if Hikma is behind these specific filings, these areas represent the generic opportunity set where Hikma is well placed and likely to pursue, providing a healthy LT pipeline.</p> <p>With Hikma trading at 15 times 2017 estimated earnings, a substantial discount to history, we see limited downside near-term. The stock has underperformed by 19% over the past 3 months; we see upside as we view the stock as oversold. </p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Land Securities</strong> has been lifted 33p to \u00a310.18 following a lower than expected fall in net asset value, a 4.5% rise in revenue profit - although it fell into a \u00a395m pretax loss after property revaluations - and comments that it was \u201crelatively insulated\u201d against any weakness in the property market following the \u201cuncharted territory\u201d after the Brexit vote.</p> <p>Tobacco group <strong>BAT</strong> is 26p better \u00a343.07 despite reports that US target Reynolds had rejected its $47bn bid.</p> <p>But mining shares have lost ground after their recent gains, with <strong>Antofagasta </strong>falling 40.5p to 665.5p and <strong>Rio Tinto</strong> down 130p at 3015.5p. The sector had been boosted by hopes of increased demand if Trump fulfils his pledge to boost US infrastructure spending.</p> <p>Among the mid-caps, <strong>TalkTalk</strong> is down 10.8p at 190.3p following <strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/nov/15/talktalk-shares-fall-despite-big-jump-in-profits\">its figures</a></strong>, while biotech group <strong>BTG</strong> has lost 27p to 619p despite a 24% rise in half year revenues. Analysts said foreign exchange movements had hit earnings, with Jefferies saying:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Management envisages a \u00a325m full year charge for losses on foreign exchange forward contracts, which is not included within our current \u00a3123m adjusted pretax profit forecast. Following expiry of most foreign exchange contracts the full benefits of a weaker pound should benefit profits from 2018.</p> <p>[A] lack of meaningful updates on a possible Varithena inflection and PneumRx coils revenues down year on yearmay still weigh on sentiment, in our view.

      "bodyText": "A tripling of pre-tax profits and reassurances that TalkTalk is firmly on the road to recovery after last year\u2019s cyber attack failed to cheer investors as the company\u2019s share price fell almost 5% in early trading. Dido Harding, the chief executive, said the company had tried to maintain a \u201crelentless focus\u201d on customers after the personal details of more than 150,000 were hacked last October. \u201cOne year on from the cyber attack \u2026 we have delivered an excellent uplift in first half profits and expect to deliver materially higher full-year profits than last year,\u201d he said. The company reported pre-tax profits of \u00a346m in the six months to the end of September, compared with \u00a314m in the same period last year. Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (ebitda) \u2013 the profits metric most closely watched by analysts and investors \u2013 rose 44% to \u00a3130m. This was well ahead of analysts\u2019 consensus expectations of ebitda of about \u00a3115m. TalkTalk, which was fined a record \u00a3400,000 for the security failings that led to the hack, reported total revenues down 1.1% to \u00a3902m in the year to September. Despite the profit surge, TalkTalk\u2019s share price fell almost 5% in early trading as the company also reported that it lost 29,000 broadband customers and 56,000 TV customers in the first half of its financial year. The shares have fallen more than 20% over the past year and are now trading at about 191p. In the first half of 2015\u2019s financial year TalkTalk lost 80,000 broadband customers, but added 25,000 TV customers. The company said its attempt to \u201cre-establish brand and value credentials\u201d following the attack, with the launch of fixed low-price plans and more service improvements, is starting to pay off. TalkTalk\u2019s customer churn rate, the rate at which customers leave for rivals, fell in the three months to the end of September. Harding said that the hard work that has been put in since the cyberattack to improve security and rebuild trust from customers and the wider public has paid off. \u201cCustomers trust us more today than they did a year ago before the cyber attack,\u201d said Harding. \u201cThey trust us more, rate us more highly as a brand, they are more satsified with us and there are fewer Ofcom [service] complaints. We tried to be open and honest and look after our customers and as a result our product is better than 18 months ago and we are more trusted.\u201d The move to offer lower fixed-cost plans six weeks ago has seen 10 times as many customers \u201cre-contracting\u201d than previously. \u201cWe are delighted with the initial response to our fixed low-price plans, which offer customers simple, affordable and fair prices in an increasingly confusing market place,\u201d said Harding. \u201cBy allowing our existing customers to switch to these new plans, we are delivering a value for money proposition to our customer base that is genuinely unique in the market, and are laying the foundations for a fundamental transformation of the TalkTalk brand.\u201d However, it admitted that the move would hit profits, restating expectations for full-year ebitda at the lower end of its \u00a3320m to \u00a3360m guidance range. Harding said she expected TalkTalk to return to retail subscriber growth and revenue growth in its next financial year. \u201cI would be the first to admit that we have a historic reputation as a cheap challenger,\u201d she said. \u201cWe have been on a journey to being a great value provider: Simple, reliable, affordable and fair is a great place to be.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Construction work in central London has reached the highest level for eight years, demonstrating the resilience of the city\u2019s key business districts despite warnings that companies will leave because of Brexit. The amount of office space being built in central London stands at 14.8m sq ft across 120 projects, up more than 4% compared with six months ago and before the EU referendum. Bank bosses have warned that the industry could withdraw operations from London due to the uncertainty surrounding Britain\u2019s departure from the European Union, with Sir Howard Davies, the chairman of Royal Bank of Scotland, the latest to speak out. However, Chris Lewis, head of occupier advisory at Deloitte Real Estate, said the figures showed the capital was resilient. Projects that have approved since the EU vote in June include the 62-storey 22 Bishopsgate, which will be the tallest building in the City of London. Nonetheless, there is evidence that the uncertainty caused by the Brexit vote has had an impact. The volume of construction projects started during the past six months fell by 42% compared with the previous six months, and completion dates have slipped by an average of three months, according to the London office crane survey by Deloitte. Just two of the 40 projects started in the past six months have a business signed up to occupy them. Lewis said: \u201cBrexit is just one of the components around occupier demand and take-up \u2013 the other elements include the broader economic uncertainty. London is home to international businesses and, with big elections in the US and mainland Europe as well, there is the potential for quite a lot of change and disruption. \u201cLondon is massively resilient. The considerations around what an occupier does is about more than Brexit, it\u2019s just one of the things in the melting pot.\u201d Of the 14.8m sq ft under construction, 8.8m sq ft is in the City of London, with 1.7m sq ft in the West End and 1m sq ft in the Docklands, which includes Canary Wharf. There is also 2.9m sq ft of space being built in three areas earmarked to become business hubs \u2013 Battersea, White City and Stratford.
