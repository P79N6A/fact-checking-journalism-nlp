    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Blackwell\u2019s is back in the black. After 10 years of losing money, the chain of academic bookshops turned a profit last year and hopes to realise a long-held ambition to become a John Lewis-style staff-owned business. Every one of Blackwell\u2019s 550 permanent employees, from chief executive to junior bookseller will be handed a share of the business. \u201cEveryone will own it. It will be a very democratic organisation,\u201d says chief executive David Prescott, sitting in his sparsely furnished office above the main Oxford store. \u201cWe will all have a share, none of us will individually own shares. It will be an equal stake whether you are the guy in \u2018goods in\u2019 [unloading deliveries], or a bookseller or the CEO. We will share it equally.\u201d Some of the 200 staff in Blackwell\u2019s campus shops, which open only during term time, may also be eligible. The owner, Toby Blackwell, whose great-grandfather founded the bookshop in 1879, has long wanted to hand it over to staff, hoping to secure its future and keep the family name above the door. Recession and enormous changes in the book world intervened. For years, the plan was left on the shelf, but now it is being dusted off. Prescott says the business will soon be in a position to \u201cstand on [its] own two feet\u201d. Although Blackwell\u2019s has not set a date to institute the change of ownership, legal documents are being drafted and a constitution of values has been drawn up. \u201cWe wouldn\u2019t be setting up the [legal] vehicles now if it wasn\u2019t going to happen in the next two to three years,\u201d Prescott says. The inspiration has always been the John Lewis partnership, which controls the department store chain and Waitrose supermarkets. \u201cWe have seen from John Lewis that when you own it, you care for it more and that brings commercial success as well.\u201d Prescott used to be \u201cthe guy in goods in\u201d. He began his bookselling career in 1995, unloading books and logging them on the catalogue system. After working his way through the ranks, he took charge of Blackwell\u2019s retail business in 2011 and became chief executive in 2013. One of his first tasks was to announce the closure of Blackwell\u2019s loss making library services division with the loss of 51 jobs. This is one factor behind the chain\u2019s recovery, which he stresses is incomplete. \u201cWe are not at the point yet when we can say we are over the line.\u201d He is not expecting Blackwell\u2019s to make a profit this year, as all proceeds are being ploughed back into the business to upgrade stores and develop a hi-tech till system. Times are still tough. Waterstones, Britain\u2019s largest bookshop chain, this week reported a 6% fall in sales. Blackwell\u2019s declared victory in its latest accounts, simply because sales were flat against a backdrop of decline for the industry. But Prescott thinks the outlook for high street booksellers is improving, after painful years when hundreds of shops were shuttered in a sharp economic downturn as they faced fierce competition from ebooks. Borders, the US chain that also ran Books Etc, collapsed into administration in 2009. From 2005 to 2014, 500 independent booksellers closed. Prescott, who is also vice-president of the Booksellers Association, thinks the book world is settling down after a \u201csignificant shift\u201d from print to digital. \u201cThere is no reason why the industry shouldn\u2019t start to grow again in terms of bookshops being successful.\u201d But remaining booksellers cannot stand aloof behind their counters. Increasingly bookshops are more than \u201ca space to buy books\u201d, but are also a social space for the community, he says. Many bookshops took up this role years ago \u2013 photographs line the Blackwell\u2019s stairs of Michael Palin and Roy Jenkins at book signings in the early 1990s, a reminder that the author event is hardly new. But bookshops have never seemed so social. Blackwell\u2019s turned the philosophy department of its Oxford store into a theatre for eight weeks in recent summers, staging Hamlet and Doctor Faustus. Its events programme is becoming more eclectic: John Lydon, Boris Johnson and Vivienne Westwood have appeared, while many shops run quizzes and book clubs to keep in touch with regular readers. Amid this buzz of activity, Prescott sounds relaxed about the storybook villain of the publishing world: Amazon. \u201cThey are brilliant at what they do. They are a logistics business; they get things from A to B and that is great,\u201d he says. \u201cWe have 500 booksellers and we can make personal recommendations.\u201d He also points out that Blackwell\u2019s started selling books online in 1995, the same year that Amazon arrived on the web. With Faustus and a Sex Pistols alumnus in the wings, it is easy to overlook Blackwell\u2019s bread and butter business: selling textbooks to students and universities, as well as supplying specialist titles to business and public sector bodies, such as the Ministry of Defence and NHS. Academic publishers have been the most reluctant converts to the world of e-readers, but Blackwell\u2019s is determined not to be left behind. At the start of this academic year, it launched Blackwell Learning, a platform for students to purchase, read and annotate textbooks on phones, tablets and computers. Sales figures have not been released, though Prescott says he is confident of significant uptake. His one criticism of publishers is that \u201cthey have tried to keep the book stitched together\u201d and haven\u2019t responded to customers who are accustomed to downloading music and TV in bite-sized pieces. He would like to see publishers allowing students to download individual chapters. \u201cIn the same way you don\u2019t need to buy the album, you can buy one track on iTunes. I would imagine that is going to be something that customers will increasingly demand.\u201d While digital disruption is getting under way in academic publishing, in fiction and general bookselling, the storm may be passing. At Blackwell\u2019s, tablet computer sales have overtaken e-readers. Meanwhile, the spectacular growth rates for ebooks are beginning to ebb. In the first 10 months of 2014, sale of ebooks rose by 8%, compared with growth rates of 19% and 66% in previous years, according to the Publishers Association.

But he says he gets plenty of recommendations from \u201cRay on the front counter\u201d. Ultimately, the future of his business is going to turn on whether events with big names, customer service, unexpected discoveries and cups of tea prove to be a tempting enough combination to attract the general public to buy in bookshops.

      "body": "<p>Blackwell\u2019s is back in the black. After 10 years of losing money, the chain of academic bookshops turned a profit last year and hopes to realise a long-held ambition to become a John Lewis-style staff-owned business.</p> <p>Every one of Blackwell\u2019s 550 permanent employees, from chief executive to junior bookseller will be handed a share of the business.</p> <p>\u201cEveryone will own it. It will be a very democratic organisation,\u201d says chief executive David Prescott, sitting in his sparsely furnished office above the main Oxford store. \u201cWe will all have a share, none of us will individually own shares. It will be an equal stake whether you are the guy in \u2018goods in\u2019 [unloading deliveries], or a bookseller or the CEO. We will share it equally.\u201d</p> <p>Some of the 200 staff in Blackwell\u2019s campus shops, which open only during term time, may also be eligible.</p> <p>The owner, Toby Blackwell, whose great-grandfather founded the bookshop in 1879, has long wanted to hand it over to staff, hoping to secure its future and keep <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2010/sep/09/blackwells-ownership-to-staff\" title=\"\">the family name above the door</a>. Recession and enormous changes in the book world intervened. For years, the plan was left on the shelf, but now it is being dusted off.</p> <p>Prescott says the business will soon be in a position to \u201cstand on [its] own two feet\u201d.</p> <p>Although Blackwell\u2019s has not set a date to institute the change of ownership, legal documents are being drafted and a constitution of values has been drawn up.</p> <p>\u201cWe wouldn\u2019t be setting up the [legal] vehicles now if it wasn\u2019t going to happen in the next two to three years,\u201d Prescott says.</p> <p>The inspiration has always been the John Lewis partnership, which controls the department store chain and Waitrose supermarkets. \u201cWe have seen from John Lewis that when you own it, you care for it more and that brings commercial success as well.\u201d</p> <p>Prescott used to be \u201cthe guy in goods in\u201d. He began his bookselling career in 1995, unloading books and logging them on the catalogue system. After working his way through the ranks, he took charge of Blackwell\u2019s retail business in 2011 and became chief executive in 2013.</p> <p>One of his first tasks was to announce the closure of Blackwell\u2019s loss making library services division with the loss of 51 jobs. This is one factor behind the chain\u2019s recovery, which he stresses is incomplete. \u201cWe are not at the point yet when we can say we are over the line.\u201d</p> <p>He is not expecting Blackwell\u2019s to make a profit this year, as all proceeds are being ploughed back into the business to upgrade stores and develop a hi-tech till system.</p> <p>Times are still tough. Waterstones, Britain\u2019s largest bookshop chain, this week <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/feb/05/waterstones-losses-sales-britains-biggest-bookshop-chain\" title=\"\">reported a 6% fall in sales</a>. Blackwell\u2019s declared victory in its latest accounts, simply because sales were flat against a backdrop of decline for the industry.</p> <p>But Prescott thinks the outlook for high street booksellers is improving, after painful years when hundreds of shops were shuttered in a sharp economic downturn as they faced fierce competition from ebooks.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Graphic: book sales\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://static.guim.co.uk/ni/1423242218341/book_sales.svg&quot; style=&quot;width:100%;&quot;&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>Borders, the US chain that also ran Books Etc, collapsed into administration in 2009. From 2005 to 2014, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/feb/21/independent-bookshops-campaign\" title=\"\">500 independent booksellers closed</a>.</p> <p>Prescott, who is also vice-president of the Booksellers Association, thinks the book world is settling down after a \u201csignificant shift\u201d from print to digital. \u201cThere is no reason why the industry shouldn\u2019t start to grow again in terms of bookshops being successful.\u201d</p> <p>But remaining booksellers cannot stand aloof behind their counters. Increasingly bookshops are more than \u201ca space to buy books\u201d, but are also a social space for the community, he says.</p> <p>Many bookshops took up this role years ago \u2013 photographs line the Blackwell\u2019s stairs of Michael Palin and Roy Jenkins at book signings in the early 1990s, a reminder that the author event is hardly new.</p> <p>But bookshops have never seemed so social. Blackwell\u2019s turned the philosophy department of its Oxford store into a theatre for eight weeks in recent summers, staging Hamlet and Doctor Faustus. Its events programme is becoming more eclectic: John Lydon, Boris Johnson and Vivienne Westwood have appeared, while many shops run quizzes and book clubs to keep in touch with regular readers.</p> <p>Amid this buzz of activity, Prescott sounds relaxed about the storybook villain of the publishing world: Amazon. \u201cThey are brilliant at what they do. They are a logistics business; they get things from A to B and that is great,\u201d he says. \u201cWe have 500 booksellers and we can make personal recommendations.\u201d</p> <p>He also points out that Blackwell\u2019s started selling books online in 1995, the same year that Amazon arrived on the web.</p> <p>With Faustus and a Sex Pistols alumnus in the wings, it is easy to overlook Blackwell\u2019s bread and butter business: selling textbooks to students and universities, as well as supplying specialist titles to business and public sector bodies, such as the Ministry of Defence and NHS.</p> <p>Academic publishers have been the most reluctant converts to the world of e-readers, but Blackwell\u2019s is determined not to be left behind. At the start of this academic year, it launched Blackwell Learning, a platform for students to purchase, read and annotate textbooks on phones, tablets and computers. Sales figures have not been released, though Prescott says he is confident of significant uptake.</p> <p>His one criticism of publishers is that \u201cthey have tried to keep the book stitched together\u201d and haven\u2019t responded to customers who are accustomed to downloading music and TV in bite-sized pieces. He would like to see publishers allowing students to download individual chapters. \u201cIn the same way you don\u2019t need to buy the album, you can buy one track on iTunes. I would imagine that is going to be something that customers will increasingly demand.\u201d</p> <p>While digital disruption is getting under way in academic publishing, in fiction and general bookselling, the storm may be passing. At Blackwell\u2019s, tablet computer sales have overtaken e-readers. Meanwhile, the spectacular growth rates for ebooks are beginning to ebb. In the first 10 months of 2014, sale of ebooks rose by 8%, compared with growth rates of 19% and 66% in previous years, according to the Publishers Association.</p> <p>Like most bookselling executives, Prescott has an e-reader, but mostly reads print, picking titles that range \u201ccompletely across the spectrum\u201d.

Back on Monday. As the battlelines between Greek and the rest of the eurozone were drawn ahead of a key Eurogroup meeting next week, stock markets slipped back as investors reacted to the uncertainty. Higher than forecast US jobs data provided some support but not enough to drag most European shares into positive territory. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished down 12.49 points or 0.18% at 6853.44 Germany\u2019s Dax dipped 0.54% to 10,846.39 France\u2019s Cac closed 0.26% lower at 4691.03 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB fell 0.28% to 20,760.74 But Spain\u2019s Ibex edged up 0.36% to 10,573.1 As for Greece, the Athens market fell by 1.97% to 803.36, with the banking sector down 9.8% on fears about future financing if the country fails to solve its financial problems. But after several days of a whistlestop tour round Europe by the new Greek government, the Athens market actually rose 11.3% on the week, while the banks wer up 11.6%. Over on Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up around 44 points or 0.25% after the US non-farm payroll numbers. On that note, it\u2019s time to close up for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back next week. And some Reuters snaps coming out of Greece: 06-Feb-2015 17:20 - GREEK GOVERNMENT OFFICIAL SAYS GREECE DOES NOT WANT REMAINING BAILOUT TRANCHES APART FOR 1.9 BILLION EURO PROFIT RETURNS FROM ECB 06-Feb-2015 17:22 - GREEK GOVERNMENT OFFICIAL SAYS NECESSARY FOR GREECE TO BE GIVEN ABILITY TO ISSUE MORE T-BILLS TO COVER ANY EXTRA NEEDS More conflicting reports from Greece. Helena Smith reports: Greek media are now reporting that the prime minister\u2019s office is firmly rebuffing suggestions that the government will reject outright accepting any form of extension on the current bailout programme. Given the eurogroup president\u2019s refusal to countenance a bridge loan that could tide the country over until it is able to present it\u2019s own debt reduction proposals, Athens may well be reconsidering its options. Officials in the prime minister\u2019s office are being quoted as saying they knew about the emergency Eurogroup meeting that will be held next Wednesday to discuss Greece, and \u201cwelcome the news and will present analytical plans then.\u201d You may recall that earlier we put a couple of photos of Greek finance minister Yanis Varoufakis on his phone, with my colleague Graeme wondering who he was phoning. Well now we have an answer, from the man himself: And more: More eurozone bigwigs coming out with their advice to Greece, this time Klaus Regling, managing director of the European Stability Mechanism: More from Reuters on the US comments on Greece: The United States told Greece through its ambassador on Friday to work cooperatively with its European colleagues and the International Monetary Fund and that Athens needed to push ahead with reforms. \u201cGreece should continue to make administrative and structural reforms and exercise fiscal prudence,\u201d the embassy said in a statement. U.S. Ambassador to Greece David Pearce earlier met Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras and senior ministers from the recently elected leftist government. Athens has been seeking support for renegotiating the terms of its international bailout and to end the austerity that is imposed by the EU and IMF with it. Meanwhile the US stock market has opened, and despite the futures predicting a hefty double digit rise on the Dow Jones Industrial Average after the blowout non-farm payroll numbers, it hasn\u2019t turned out like that so far. The Dow is currently up just 11 points, as investors speculate the higher than forecast jobs and average earnings figures might prompt the US Federal Reserve to sanction an interest rate rise sooner than expected. Dr Harm Bandholz, chief US economist at UniCredit Research, said: In its latest Federal Open Market Committee statement the Fed upgraded its assessment of the labor market from \u201csolid\u201d to \u201cstrong\u201d. Today\u2019s employment numbers unequivocally vindicated this wording change. Given the fact that most FOMC members see the plunge in oil prices, which will push inflation rates even lower in the coming months, as a positive for the US economy, we remain convinced that the Fed continues to get closer to its first rate hike. Chair Yellen\u2019s semi-annual monetary policy report before Congress later this month provides her with a good opportunity to prepare markets for further changes in the Fed\u2019s rhetoric. In the wake of the earlier meeting between Greek finance minister Yanis Varoufakis and a delegation from the US Treasury, Reuters has a snap outlining the view from across the Atlantic: 06-Feb-2015 14:40 - ATHENS- U.S. SAYS GREECE MUST MAKE REFORMS TO MEET INTERNATIONAL OBLIGATIONS, WORK COOPERATIVELY WITH EU, IMF Some confusion surrounding supposed comments from Eurogroup president Jeroen Dijsselbloem: Cyprus\u2019s bailout programme has also hit a hurdle. Its Troika of lenders have been unable to complete their latest assessment of its financial programme, because MPs voted last month to suspend a law to help banks to tackle bad debts. In a statement today, the lenders say that reducing the high level of non-performing loans is essential to restoring growth and job creation in Cyprus. Given the further suspension of the effective application of the foreclosure framework, reaching staff-level agreement on the review was not possible during this visit. The teams look forward to a timely completion of the review as soon as the conditions are in place for a positive conclusion. Athens-based journalist Efthimia Efthimiou is hearing that the new Greek government fears it will \u201ccollapse\u201d if it sticks with the old bailout promises. Yanis Varoufakis has been working his phone inside the Athens parliament today.... Back to Greece.... and the Athens stock market has now fallen 3% as another gust of gloom sweeps through the trading floor. That follows both sides taking a hard line ahead of next Wednesday\u2019s eurogroup meeting. As covered earlier, the German government wants Greece to turn up with a plan to deal with its debt problem, but the Greek government says it won\u2019t accept a deal based on the old bailout. It mean confrontation is looming... Hike, hike, hike..... The dollar has surged on the foreign exchanges, as traders anticipate that the strong jobs report will prompt a US rate hike within a few months. The surprisingly strong jump in average earnings (+0.5% month-on-month) may ease Fed chair Janet Yellen\u2019s concerns over wage growth. Rob Carnell of ING says a June rate hike is \u201cback in the picture. Instant reaction: Not got a Reuters terminal? No problem... This strong jobs report raises the chances that the US Federal Reserve is going to start raising interest rates before too much longer. The US unemployment rate has inched up to 5.7%, from 5.6%, despite the strong job creation over the last three months. That indicates that more people came back to the labour market, as it strengthens. And it\u2019s a blowout reading on earnings too -- average US earnings rose by 0.5% in January, much stronger than the 0.3% that analysts had predicted. Breaking: The US economy created 257,000 new jobs in January, that\u2019s a better reading than expected. And revisions to December and November\u2019s data has added another 147,000 new jobs. Wow..... Newsflash from Athens: Yanis Varoufakis has no intention of agreeing to anything based on the old bailout programme, at next Wednesday\u2019s eurogroup. So says a government official, drawing the battle lines ahead of the extraordinary meeting. GREEK FINMIN VAROUFAKIS WILL NOT AGREE TO ANY DEAL RELATING TO PREVIOUS BAILOUT PROGRAMME AT NEXT WEEK\u2019S EUROGROUP - GOVERNMENT OFFICIAL GREECE WILL ASK EUROGROUP FOR \u201cBRIDGE AGREEMENT\u201d UNTIL IT PRESENTS OVERALL DEBT AND REFORM PLAN-GOVERNMENT OFFICIAL GREECE EXPECTS TOUGH STANCE FROM EU PARTNERS, THAT THEY WILL ASK ATHENS TO COMMIT TO PREVIOUS AGREEMENTS, EXTENSION OF CURRENT BAILOUT OK, it\u2019s nearly time for the final major piece of economic news of the week - the US unemployment report for January. Economists expect that around 234,000 new jobs were created last month. Arguably the average earnings data will be more interesting -- it could either boost, or undermine, the odds of the Federal Reserve raising rates in the coming months. Finland\u2019s government has survived a confidence vote over the Greek crisis: As feared, it\u2019s been a quieter day than we\u2019ve got used to in 2015. #Mustn\u2019tGrumble Eurozone finance ministers have called an emergency meeting for next Wednesday night to discuss the Greek crisis. Germany wants Athens to turn up with a plan.... Greece\u2019s finance minister, Yanis Varoufakis, has met with a delegation from the US Treasury... ...and reeling from the indignity of not being allowed into the Reform Club. The Athens parliament has elected a new speaker, human rights lawyer Zoe Konstantopoulou. Varoufakis has also been sworn in: Greek bank stocks have dropped, despite its central bank insisting yesterday that the sector was completely safe. Analysts are hopeful that Greece and its creditors will agree a deal. ABN Amro reckons the two sides are inching closer.... And Goldman Sachs warns that the next few days will be crucial: While in the UK, the trade gap has widened to a four-year high. Trade in goods was the worst performance ever..... Yanis watch: Here\u2019s Greece\u2019s finance minister arriving at the finance ministry in Athens, to meet senior US Treasury official Daleep Singh and Lea Bouzis. Italy\u2019s finance minister, Pier Carlo Padoan, has declared that eurozone finance ministers will aim for a \u2018unified position\u2019 on Greece at next Wednesday\u2019s extraordinary meeting. That\u2019s via the MNI newswire, which reports that Padoan also identified political union as the eurozone\u2019s \u201cultimate goal\u201d. The eurozone crisis is a conflict between countries, right? Wrong! It\u2019s a conflict between economic sectors. So says economist Michael Pettis in a very thought-provoking blog post. He argues that it\u2019s fundamentally wrong to focus on clashes between rich and poor, or efficient and inefficient, countries. Instead, it\u2019s a class war. Pettis says: In fact, the current European crisis is boringly similar to nearly every currency and sovereign debt crisis in modern history, in that it pits the interests of workers and small producers against the interests of bankers. The former want higher wages and rapid economic growth. The latter want to protect the value of the currency and the sanctity of debt. And there\u2019s a lot of fascinating history to back this up: Michael Pettis: Syriza and the French indemnity of 1871-73 FT Alphaville have kicked the tires on the theory too, and point out that German workers have also suffered from this crisis: One of the worst costs \u2014 for Germany \u2014 has been the lack productivity growth. For all the talk of Teutonic competitiveness, German labour productivity has grown at the meagre pace of just 0.6 per cent per year, on average, since 1998. Output per hour worked is actually lower now than it was in 2007. FT Alphaville: Michael Pettis explains the euro crisis (and a lot of other things, too) Shocking news. Greece\u2019s finance minister was apparently refused entry to London\u2019s Reform Club this week. The Private Members club baulked at Yanis Varoufakis\u2019s open-collar look, even though he was chaperoned by a former Chancellor of the Exchequer, Lord Lamont. The FT\u2019s Diary has the story: The Greek economist certainly impressed the hedgies and City types he addressed on Monday night. His two-hour speech received a standing ovation; his flawless English, \u201cmore eloquent than practically the entire British Cabinet\u201d, said one person who met him. \u201cNot the dogmatic Marxist he\u2019s portrayed as.\u201d But not everything went to plan on the visit. Lord Lamont tried to give a breakfast for his friend at the Reform Club, only to find that the perennially tie-less Varoufakis wasn\u2019t allowed in. Lord Lamont tells City Insider: \u201cThey wouldn\u2019t accept that his national dress was not a tie.\u201d So they popped around the corner to the less formal Sofitel. It\u2019s not like Varoufakis doesn\u2019t scrub up rather well, either... British exporters have called for more help after the UK trade gap hit a four-year high. Katie Allen reports: Britain\u2019s trade deficit last year was the widest since the coalition came to power, dealing a blow to the government\u2019s drive to rebalance the economy away from consumer spending. Official figures released on Friday, showing a trading deficit for goods and services of \u00a334.8bn in 2014, will make disappointing reading for the Conservative party as it seeks to capitalise on its economic record ahead of May\u2019s election. Despite a vow to revive manufacturing and raise exports, the trade deficit last year was the widest since 2010 as exports fell faster than imports. The news prompted fresh calls for export support from the British Chambers of Commerce. The business lobby group\u2019s chief economist, David Kern, commented: \u201cWe are clearly not making adequate progress in rebalancing our economy, and the weakening of the eurozone is creating problems for our exporters. Much greater efforts are needed to develop a national strategy for boosting exports, with improved access to finance for growing firms.\u201d Full story: UK trade deficit widens to four-year high Germany want Greece to present a strategy for its debt problems to eurozone finance ministers on Wednesday, at the emergency Eurogroup meeting announced this morning. A German finance ministry spokesman told reporters that the Berlin government is \u201ccompletely open what will happen after the end of the current bailout programme.\u201d Heads-up. A protest rally in support of Greece has been called in Barcelona tonight: Meetings are about to begin in Athens between finance minister Yanis Varoufakis and team from the US treasury Daleep Singh, deputy assistant secretary for Europe &amp; Eurasia. But both sides will be keeping mum. Helena just spoken to finance ministry, which says there will be no statements afterwards. Finland\u2019s government faces a vote of confidence this lunchtime over the Greek debt crisis. The vote was called by The Finns, the anti-bailout party, which demands answers from prime minister Alexander Stubb over the issue. Yesterday, Stubb vowed to help work through the crisis to save the common currency. Human rights lawyer Zoe Konstantopoulou has become the youngest politician to hold the post of Greece\u2019s parliamentary speaker, and the second woman in close to 200 years. Although Konstantopoulou was elected with an unprecedented number of votes, she is not everybody\u2019s cup of tea. Helena explains: The centrist To Potami party lambasted Syriza for proposing that she stand for the post - one in which diplomatic skills are seen as essential. \u201cInstead of choosing an individual that can bring about accord, the perennial protagonist of parliamentary squabbles was selected instead,\u201d it said when her nomination was announced last week. Back in Greece, Zoe Konstantopoulou has been elected as parliamentary speaker with a record number of votes - 235, out of 300 MPs in total. It\u2019s official -- Eurozone finance ministers will gather in Brussels next Wednesday for a special meeting on the Greek crisis [as flagged up earlier] After a cautious start, Greek bank shares have headed south this morning as the uncertainty over its bailout programme hits confidence again. Financial stocks are leading the fallers on the Athens market, with National Bank of Greece shedding over 5%. Ian Williams of Peel Hunt says investors are worried by the lack of progress between Germany and Greece, following yesterday\u2019s press conference in Berlin: Mr Schauble continues to insist Greece abide by the troika\u2019s restructuring plans, which seems a very remote possibility given Syriza\u2019s express opposition to those arrangements. Compromise is a long way off and the renewed slump in the share prices of the Greek banks seems wholly logical. So much for rebalancing the UK economy -- the trade deficit has hit a four-year high. In December, Britain\u2019s trade deficit widened to \u00a32.9bn, up from \u00a31.8bn in November 2014. That\u2019s because the UK imported \u00a310.2bn more physical goods than it sold to the rest of the world in December. Services provided a surplus of \u00a37.3bn. And a secret vote to elect Zoe Konstantonopoulou, a lawyer by training and one of Syriza\u2019s leading lights, as Greece\u2019s parliamentary speaker is now underway. She is expected to easily be catapulted to the post. Helena Smith says: \u201cI bumped into Zoe in corridors of parliament yesterday. She was excited. Asked if she felt Greece was experiencing a historic turning point, she shot back: \u201cAll the way.\u2019\u201d Over in Athens, Helena Smith reports that parliament has just sworn in finance minister Yanis Varoufakis. Deputy foreign minister in charge of international investment Euclid Tsakalotos (who was educated in London [St Paul\u2019s, no less] before going up to Oxford), has also been sworn in. Sounds like the rumours were true. Two EU officials have told the WSJ that eurozone finance ministers will hold a special meeting about Greece on Wednesday. That\u2019s one day before European leaders hold a two-day summit. Gabriele Steinhauser says: The talks are supposed to free EU leaders, who are meeting in Brussels on Thursday, from having to delve into the details of Greece\u2019s financial problems. That\u2019s also the day after the new Greek government holds its confidence vote, so we\u2019d know Tsipras\u2019s policy plans by then. Greek newspapers are dominated, of course, by yesterday\u2019s meeting in Berlin. Enikos.gr have rounded up the details: \u201cWar of nerves\u201d is the headline in Ethnos referring to the ups and downs of Greece\u2019s negotiations as well as the backstage politics taking place. Varoufakis wants 67% of the existing bailout programme and 33% reforms, says Eleftheros Typos. Ta Nea says Greece is \u201cDancing with wolves\u201d and is facing pressure and threats to comply with its commitments. Angela Merkel\u2019s government is facing its historic responsibility to prove it cares about a European Germany and not a German Europe, says Efimeritha ton Syntakton. The Greek parliamentary wheels are turning... Traders in Athens made a cautious start this morning, pushing the ATG index up around 1%. Bank shares, which have been through a stomach-churning ride in recent days, are inching higher; Eurobank has gained 4%. Last night, the Greek central bank insisted that the country\u2019s financial sector was \u201cabsolutely safe\u201d, with no liquidity problems. The FT has some good news for Greece - apparently the ECB\u2019s governing council was split over Wednesday night\u2019s contentious decision to ban the use of Greek debt as collateral for cheap loans. Frankfurt correspondent Claire Jones reports that national central bank chiefs were fairly evenly split \u2013 but under the rolling voting system Greece, Cyprus, Ireland and France didn\u2019t get a vote. That may indicate that there won\u2019t be enough support to slam the ECB\u2019s liquidity window shut of Greece doesn\u2019t reach a debt deal by the end of February. Geopolitical worries have helped to push most European stock markets into the red this morning, with the FTSE 100 down around 0.4%. Marc Ostwald of ADM Investors Services says the City is worried by \u201cthe uncertainties which surrounds Greece, and the Ukraine, which appears to be hurtling out of control on every count.\u201d Over in the Wall Street Journal, Stephen Fidler says Europe is pondering how much Greece really means to them. One question European policy makers are asking is whether Mr. Tsipras represents a break to [Greece\u2019s] clientelistic tradition, or whether he will be guided by the business-as-usual principle that \u201cit\u2019s our turn now.\u201d If the former, Greece\u2019s eurozone partners may be more inclined to accommodate its requests provided the government signs up to meaningful reform. If the latter, they may eventually be inclined to take the risk of casting it adrift. More here: Europe Weighs the Costs Of Casting Greece Aside Our own Nils Pratley warns that Yanis Varoufakis, for all his \u201csweet reasonableness\u201d this week, didn\u2019t actually achieved much during his dash between around European capitals. The eurozone\u2019s big beasts seem determined to force a quick resolution, rather than accept Syriza\u2019s timetable. Optimists might reflect that Germany, as a negotiating tactic, was always going to make the threat of Grexit, or Greece\u2019s exit from the euro, feel real. Does Germany really want to be seen as responsible for driving Greece out of the eurozone? Probably not. But the pressure being applied on Syriza is hard and has arrived, courtesy of the ECB, earlier than expected. Varoufakis has won a few sympathisers on his tour of capitals. What he and Syriza need, however, is out-and-out supporters within the eurozone. They haven\u2019t collected any yet. More here: Greece and Varoufakis need supporters not sympathisers While the FT\u2019s man in Berlin, Stefan Wagstyl, may boast a well-stocked film collection: It was not quite Ill Met by Moonlight , the film in which second world war commandos and Greek guerrillas help kidnap a Wehrmacht general. But it was nonetheless dramatic when the Greek and German finance ministers finally met for a showdown in Berlin over the Greek debt crisis. Like the best movie stars, Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble and Yanis Varoufakis kept the crowds waiting. And when they finally appeared at their press conference after two hours of talks it was to announce that they were as far apart as ever on how to refinance Athens once its rescue programme expires at the end of this month. If they agreed on one thing, it was that this particular eurozone thriller still has a long way to run. More here: Showdown in Berlin leaves leading actors poles apart Greece and its lenders may be inching towards a deal, reckons Nick Kounis, head of macro &amp; financial markets research at ABN Amro. Here\u2019s a flavour of his research note this morning. A deal looks to more reachable Despite this uncomfortable meeting, a deal has recently become more feasible. Greece previously rejected the idea of a Euro-IMF adjustment programme. Yet at the press conference, the Greek finance minister said that the country was looking at \u2018a bridging programme\u2019 to tide it through until a new deal was struck. He also said he agreed with 70% of what was in the old programme. The three elements of a new agreement We think a new deal will have three pillars. First, a new reform programme, with more emphasis on tackling tax evasion and vested interests, and less on welfare and social spending cuts. Second, debt relief for Greece, perhaps in steps, conditional on reform progress. Help on this front was promised to Greece in November 2012 by the Eurogroup. Third, a lower primary surplus target, which would fit with the lower level of debt and allow less aggressive fiscal consolidation. All these elements look politically feasible. He also flags up that Greek banks are losing deposits as the crisis intensifies... Yesterday\u2019s press conference between Yanis Varoufakis and Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble made it to the front page of two UK papers this morning: Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the eurozone crisis, the world economy, business and finance. Greece\u2019s whistle-stop tour of European capitals is over, but the clock is still ticking in its push to agree new financing before its bailout programme expires. Finance minister Yanis Varoufakis returned home last night after that edgy press conference with Germany\u2019s Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble, without signs of a breakthrough. Greek and German finance ministers clash at debt relief talks So now, attention shifts to Athens, where Varoufakis will meet with officials from the US Treasury today, led by Daleep Singh, the Deputy Assistant Secretary for Europe. Prime minister Alexis Tsipras will be drawing up his policy plans, ahead of a vote of confidence to confirm his government. That three-day debate is expected to begin on Sunday, Tsipras may be bolstered by last night\u2019s pro-government demonstration (a rare sight) in Athens, having made little obvious headway with his fellow European leaders this week. And this leaves financial analysts fearing another explosion in the eurozone crisis. Stan Shamu of IG sums it up: While it seems funding will continue to flow in the near term, there will be fears Greece is at risk of plunging into a fresh political crisis should the government not appease the masses with an ideal result from the negotiations. Recent steps also seem to imply European leaders are looking to put more pressure on Greece and accelerate the negotiation process. But after a series of meetings and press conferences in Paris, Rome, London, Frankfurt and Berlin, it might (finally) be a quieter day. And hopefully Varoufakis has racked up a few air miles. In other news, we get UK trade date at 9.30am GMT, and the US unemployment data at 1.30pm GMT. I\u2019ll be tracking all the main events as they occur.....",

It\u2019s a conflict between economic sectors.</strong></p> <p>So says economist Michael Pettis in <a href=\"http://blog.mpettis.com/2015/02/syriza-and-the-french-indemnity-of-1871-73/\">a very thought-provoking blog post</a>. He argues that it\u2019s fundamentally wrong to focus on clashes between rich and poor, or efficient and inefficient, countries.<strong> Instead, it\u2019s a class war.</strong></p> <p>Pettis says:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p> In fact, the current European crisis is boringly similar to nearly every currency and sovereign debt crisis in modern history, in that it pits the interests of workers and small producers against the interests of bankers. The former want higher wages and rapid economic growth. The latter want to protect the value of the currency and the sanctity of debt.</p> </blockquote> <p>And there\u2019s a lot of fascinating history to back this up:</p> <h2>Michael Pettis: <a href=\"http://blog.mpettis.com/2015/02/syriza-and-the-french-indemnity-of-1871-73/\">Syriza and the French indemnity of 1871-73</a></h2> <p>FT Alphaville have kicked the tires on the theory too, and point out that German workers have also suffered from this crisis:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>One of the worst costs \u2014 for Germany \u2014 has been the lack productivity growth. For all the talk of Teutonic competitiveness, German labour productivity has grown at the meagre pace of just 0.6 per cent per year, on average, since 1998. Output per hour worked is actually <em>lower</em> now than it was in 2007. </p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bb1941c5e795fba9f07e7377e01609dccd01e821\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/2/6/1423225752681/098607b1-ec70-4aee-81d0-098abfd8db4b-460x202.png\" alt=\"Eurozone productivity\" width=\"460\" height=\"202\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Eurozone productivity</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: FT Alphaville</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>FT Alphaville: <a href=\"http://ftalphaville.ft.com/2015/02/06/2113951/michael-pettis-explains-the-euro-crisis-and-a-lot-of-other-things-too/\">Michael Pettis explains the euro crisis (and a lot of other things, too)</a></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/izakaminska/statuses/563671545479188481\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>MUST READ summary by <a href=\"https://twitter.com/M_C_Klein\">@M_C_Klein</a> of Pettis on Eurozone, debt forgiveness &amp; how blaming periphery misses the point <a href=\"http://t.co/KrzImBPTOs\">http://t.co/KrzImBPTOs</a></p>&mdash; Izabella Kaminska (@izakaminska) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/izakaminska/status/563671545479188481\">February 6, 2015</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/izakaminska/statuses/563672218891087872\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>Also, it&#39;s an amazingly refreshing analysis of Germany&#39;s role in all this <a href=\"http://t.co/KrzImC7uG0\">http://t.co/KrzImC7uG0</a> <a href=\"http://t.co/APDfXpfaqz\">pic.twitter.com/APDfXpfaqz</a></p>&mdash; Izabella Kaminska (@izakaminska) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/izakaminska/status/563672218891087872\">February 6, 2015</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-54d4a880e4b005f82db0aa80\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2015-02-06T11:47:19.894Z\">11.47am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"cdeaa838eab3397a9bdcd8a9dd13903987214136\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/2/6/1423223181192/59fc3d18-fedf-457e-9e87-48c82d90320f-bestSizeAvailable.jpeg\" alt=\"The Reform Club\" width=\"234\" height=\"334\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Reform Club</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Shocking news.

Second, debt relief for Greece, perhaps in steps, conditional on reform progress. Help on this front was promised to Greece in November 2012 by the Eurogroup. Third, a lower primary surplus target, which would fit with the lower level of debt and allow less aggressive fiscal consolidation.

Occupants of England\u2019s 50 most valuable business premises, with a total rateable value of \u00a31.36bn, will be charged a combined sum of \u00a3672m, according to calculations by the rates campaigner Paul Turner-Mitchell. The analysis, based on figures from the government\u2019s Valuations Office Agency, showed Heathrow topped the list with four properties on its west London site in the top 50. Turner-Mitchell said: \u201cThe level of property tax paid by business is the highest of any G7 nation, OECD country or EU member state.

As well as airports, the top 50 list features power stations, government properties, banks and department stores such as Harrods and John Lewis. As well as the Sellafield reprocessing site in Cumbria, Britain\u2019s biggest nuclear complex, three atomic power stations are also in the top 10 \u2013 Sizewell B in Suffolk, Heysham 2 in Lancashire and Hartlepool.

Turner-Mitchell said: \u201dThe government\u2019s review must be extended to look at not only the system but the amount the actual system generates. \u201cProperty tax for business needs to be looked at more holistically within the overall context of the economy and other taxes not simply as a guaranteed revenue stream.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>Leading shares ended the week on a downbeat note, albeit off their worst levels following stronger than expected US jobs data.</p> <p>The <strong>FTSE 100</strong> finished down 12.49 points at 6853.44 as concerns about the standoff between Greece and the eurozone intensified ahead of a key Eurogroup meeting called for next week.</p> <p>But news that the US added 257,000 jobs in January, compared to expectations of a 236,000 increase, helped give some support to the markets, lifting the Dow Jones Industrial Average by around 50 points by the time London closed.</p> <p>Chris Beauchamp, market analyst at IG, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Of all the epithets to employ to today\u2019s non-farm payrolls up, \u2018Goldilocks\u2019 might be the best. Jobs growth was strong, but not too strong. Meanwhile earnings growth was better as well, providing the rationale for a stabilisation that still leaves the index tantalisingly close to 6900.</p> <p>Yet again it is the mining sector that has contributed most to the losses today, as the tale of oversupply that has caused such woe for the sector overall rears its head again.</p> </blockquote> <p>The biggest fallers were in fact precious metals miners following a drop in gold and silver prices in the wake of the US jobs figures, which prompted renewed talk of a US interest rate rise. So <strong>Randgold Resources</strong> dropped 240p to \u00a353.10 and <strong>Fresnillo</strong> fell 37p to 860p.<br></p> <p><strong>Barratt Developments</strong> lost 10.5p to 459.7p as Liberum, in a hefty note on housebuilders, downgraded the business from buy to hold. On the sector the broker said: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The sector\u2019s valuation is retesting highs, but is likely to push on as strong, cash-backed returns become relatively more attractive. The calmness of the land market makes this cycle genuinely different, and industry structure underpins returns. There is a wall of worry to climb, but the risks are all known and fairly limited. A 5% dividend yield is attractive in a low-return world. </p> <p>The four big concerns for the sector are valuation, the General Election, margin risks and rate rises. Each of these poses credible but limited risk, all of which should be offset by the stock market\u2019s rising appetite for high returns and yield. The General Election may only create risk if it proves inconclusive; and rate rises are only an issue if their pace exceeds wage growth.</p> </blockquote> <p>But <strong>Aberdeen Asset Management</strong> added 10.1p to 440.9p after Societe Generale issued a positive note on the asset management group.</p> <p>Meanwhile Numis analysts suggested Aberdeen could be interested in asset management group Russell Investment, put up for sale by the London Stock Exchange. Numis said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The LSE said that it has \u201calready received a number of expressions of interest\u201d and the press are suggesting there are \u201cat least three interested buyers\u201d (of which CIBC is named as one, others unnamed). It is our speculative view that Aberdeen could be among those who have taken a look. In our view, at the press rumoured price of $1.4bn (assuming there is no material surplus capital to be injected into the business before sale) is correct, then relative to historic earnings of around $80m, it does not stand out as being obviously cheap (around 17.5 times earnings) on a headline basis for an asset manager.</p> <p>However, Russell Investment appears to be cost inefficient compared to most other asset managers with scale ($256bn assets under management and $784m revenue but only around 17% operating margin versus 30%-50% industry norms). Aberdeen as a known (and successful in our view) cost cutter could therefore possibly add value. In our view, they would need to extract a 30% plus margin to make it value enhancing at a price of $1.4bn.... Additionally, Aberdeen management (for better or worse) have made it widely known they want to diversify the business away from its reliance on emerging markets and related equities, which this deal would do. They have also said that the US is a market they want to expand into. Finally, management also appeared to give the impression recently that they would look to seek shareholder approval for any future deals, possibly hinting that they are looking at a transaction of more than 10% new share issuance (which $1.4bn would be).</p> <p>We bring this to the attention of investors purely as something to look out for in the near future and be aware of (particularly with regards to the potential for a dilutive rights issue). It is a speculative view based on us piecing together various bits of information and clearly it might not happen, but we can nonetheless see logic as to why management might consider it.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Capita</strong> climbed 15p to \u00a311.58 as it was chosen to provide services such as IT and personnel services, worth up to \u00a35bn, to the National Health Service.<br></p> <p><strong>GlaxoSmithKline</strong> added 17p to 1517.5p as the pharmaceuticals group announced positive results from a phase 111 trial of its dabrafenib and trametinib combination for treating melanoma. Analyst Brian White at Shore Capital said:<br></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Importantly a positive overall survival benefit in the COMBI-d study forms part of the oncology asset sale to Novartis, $1.5bn contingent consideration determined by a positive overall survival outcome. This puts the final price paid by Novartis for GlaxoSmithKline\u2019s oncology assets to $16bn, \u00a34bn of which is due to be returned to investors via a B Share scheme following completion of the asset swap which also includes Glaxo\u2019s purchase of Novartis\u2019 Vaccines unit and the establishment of a Consumer Health joint venture controlled by Glaxo. </p> </blockquote> <p>But <strong>AstraZeneca</strong> fell 62p to \u00a344.67 as Credit Suisse issued a downbeat note. The bank put a neutral rating on the business, saying:<br></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Fourth quarter earnings were significantly below expectations, as management invested heavily in R&amp;D and SG&amp;A. This highlights AstraZeneca\u2019s dilemma: the pipeline is rich with innovation but needs heavy investment to realise its full potential. At the same time, Nexium, Crestor, and EU Symbicort are going generic, and key launch brands in respiratory and diabetes need continued investment in highly competitive categories. To mitigate this, the chief executive has introduced a new source of earnings (\u201cexternalisation revenue\u201d) selling/partnering non-core pipeline assets to prop-up earnings.

      "bodyText": "Leading shares ended the week on a downbeat note, albeit off their worst levels following stronger than expected US jobs data. The FTSE 100 finished down 12.49 points at 6853.44 as concerns about the standoff between Greece and the eurozone intensified ahead of a key Eurogroup meeting called for next week. But news that the US added 257,000 jobs in January, compared to expectations of a 236,000 increase, helped give some support to the markets, lifting the Dow Jones Industrial Average by around 50 points by the time London closed. Chris Beauchamp, market analyst at IG, said: Of all the epithets to employ to today\u2019s non-farm payrolls up, \u2018Goldilocks\u2019 might be the best. Jobs growth was strong, but not too strong. Meanwhile earnings growth was better as well, providing the rationale for a stabilisation that still leaves the index tantalisingly close to 6900. Yet again it is the mining sector that has contributed most to the losses today, as the tale of oversupply that has caused such woe for the sector overall rears its head again. The biggest fallers were in fact precious metals miners following a drop in gold and silver prices in the wake of the US jobs figures, which prompted renewed talk of a US interest rate rise. So Randgold Resources dropped 240p to \u00a353.10 and Fresnillo fell 37p to 860p. Barratt Developments lost 10.5p to 459.7p as Liberum, in a hefty note on housebuilders, downgraded the business from buy to hold. On the sector the broker said: The sector\u2019s valuation is retesting highs, but is likely to push on as strong, cash-backed returns become relatively more attractive. The calmness of the land market makes this cycle genuinely different, and industry structure underpins returns. There is a wall of worry to climb, but the risks are all known and fairly limited. A 5% dividend yield is attractive in a low-return world. The four big concerns for the sector are valuation, the General Election, margin risks and rate rises. Each of these poses credible but limited risk, all of which should be offset by the stock market\u2019s rising appetite for high returns and yield. The General Election may only create risk if it proves inconclusive; and rate rises are only an issue if their pace exceeds wage growth. But Aberdeen Asset Management added 10.1p to 440.9p after Societe Generale issued a positive note on the asset management group. Meanwhile Numis analysts suggested Aberdeen could be interested in asset management group Russell Investment, put up for sale by the London Stock Exchange. Numis said: The LSE said that it has \u201calready received a number of expressions of interest\u201d and the press are suggesting there are \u201cat least three interested buyers\u201d (of which CIBC is named as one, others unnamed). It is our speculative view that Aberdeen could be among those who have taken a look. In our view, at the press rumoured price of $1.4bn (assuming there is no material surplus capital to be injected into the business before sale) is correct, then relative to historic earnings of around $80m, it does not stand out as being obviously cheap (around 17.5 times earnings) on a headline basis for an asset manager. However, Russell Investment appears to be cost inefficient compared to most other asset managers with scale ($256bn assets under management and $784m revenue but only around 17% operating margin versus 30%-50% industry norms). Aberdeen as a known (and successful in our view) cost cutter could therefore possibly add value. In our view, they would need to extract a 30% plus margin to make it value enhancing at a price of $1.4bn.... Additionally, Aberdeen management (for better or worse) have made it widely known they want to diversify the business away from its reliance on emerging markets and related equities, which this deal would do. They have also said that the US is a market they want to expand into. Finally, management also appeared to give the impression recently that they would look to seek shareholder approval for any future deals, possibly hinting that they are looking at a transaction of more than 10% new share issuance (which $1.4bn would be). We bring this to the attention of investors purely as something to look out for in the near future and be aware of (particularly with regards to the potential for a dilutive rights issue). It is a speculative view based on us piecing together various bits of information and clearly it might not happen, but we can nonetheless see logic as to why management might consider it. Capita climbed 15p to \u00a311.58 as it was chosen to provide services such as IT and personnel services, worth up to \u00a35bn, to the National Health Service. GlaxoSmithKline added 17p to 1517.5p as the pharmaceuticals group announced positive results from a phase 111 trial of its dabrafenib and trametinib combination for treating melanoma. Analyst Brian White at Shore Capital said: Importantly a positive overall survival benefit in the COMBI-d study forms part of the oncology asset sale to Novartis, $1.5bn contingent consideration determined by a positive overall survival outcome. This puts the final price paid by Novartis for GlaxoSmithKline\u2019s oncology assets to $16bn, \u00a34bn of which is due to be returned to investors via a B Share scheme following completion of the asset swap which also includes Glaxo\u2019s purchase of Novartis\u2019 Vaccines unit and the establishment of a Consumer Health joint venture controlled by Glaxo. But AstraZeneca fell 62p to \u00a344.67 as Credit Suisse issued a downbeat note. The bank put a neutral rating on the business, saying: Fourth quarter earnings were significantly below expectations, as management invested heavily in R&amp;D and SG&amp;A. This highlights AstraZeneca\u2019s dilemma: the pipeline is rich with innovation but needs heavy investment to realise its full potential. At the same time, Nexium, Crestor, and EU Symbicort are going generic, and key launch brands in respiratory and diabetes need continued investment in highly competitive categories. To mitigate this, the chief executive has introduced a new source of earnings (\u201cexternalisation revenue\u201d) selling/partnering non-core pipeline assets to prop-up earnings. The problem is the magnitude and consistency of earnings that \u2018externalisation\u2019 needs to generate. We estimate that AstraZeneca needs to realise at least $1.5bn of proceeds from asset sales annually in 2015, 2016 and 2017 in order to keep earnings per share flat at 2014 levels and support the dividend. But should investors really pay 15-20 times PE for one-time gains on partnering/disposals? We see better opportunities elsewhere in EU Pharma (Novartis, Sanofi, Bayer). Among the mid-caps, Poundland put on 55.2p to 413p after agreeing to pay \u00a355m for rival 99p Stores. But Tate &amp; Lyle lost 91p or nearly 14% to 573.5p as it said profits would be below the level it expected in September, its third warning in a year. Finally Aim listed Clean Air Power closed 51% higher at 2.65p as it received certification from the US Environmental Protection Agency for the US version of its dual-fuel engine system preparing the ground for commercial launch.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The mining billionaire Gina Rinehart is selling her A$306m (\u00a3156m) stake in Fairfax Media after more than four years of fraught relations with the owner of the Sydney Morning Herald, according to reports. Rinehart, Australia\u2019s richest person, sold her 14.99% stake at 86.75 Australian cents a share, below the 96 cents closing price. Her company blamed falling revenues and bad business decisions at Fairfax for her decision to sell. John Klepec, chief development officer at Rinehart\u2019s Hancock Prospecting, said Fairfax management had no workable plan to revive the company and deal with declining business and circulation. \u201cA series of bad decisions made by the leadership team has instead increased the number of publication errors and reduced the company\u2019s performance to cover news to standards expected to maintain the credibility of some of the oldest and finest newspaper mastheads in the country,\u201d he said, according to The Australian. Rinehart, whose fortune is estimated at A$11.7bn (\u00a37.6bn) by Forbes, clashed frequently with Fairfax\u2019s chairman, Roger Corbett. He denied Rinehart a seat on the board after she refused to sign Fairfax\u2019s editorial independence charter. Rinehart began buying shares in Fairfax in late 2010, acquiring a 1.5% stake a day after the sudden departure of its chief executive, Brian McCarthy. Rinehart became the company\u2019s biggest shareholder in February 2012 when she bought a 14% stake and went on to build her holding to 18.7% in June 2012. She was believed to be planning a takeover of Fairfax before she reduced her stake below 15%. Fairfax\u2019s insurance policy did not protect directors holding more than 15% of a company from potential lawsuits. Fairfax\u2019s newspapers also include Melbourne\u2019s The Age and it also owns business magazines, radio stations and a digital operation. Rinehart has retained her position at the top of Australia\u2019s rich list despite a A$6bn fall in her fortune caused by the plunging price of iron ore. Hard history December 2010 Rinehart revealed as buyer of an A$50m, or 1.5%, stake in the company a day after the abrupt departure of its chief executive. January 2011 Rinehart continues building her stake and owns 4% by the end of the month. February 2012 Increases her stake to 14%, with Fairfax shares climbing back above 81 cents. March 2012 Rinehart requests seats on the company\u2019s board. June 2012 Reports emerge that Corbett is blocking Rinehart\u2019s request for board representation, and that she has refused to sign the Fairfax board\u2019s editorial independence charter. Rinehart says there are \u201cquestions to be raised concerning the current chairmanship\u201d of Fairfax and later calls for Corbett to be subject to \u201cperformance milestones\u201d. During the month Rinehart\u2019s holding in Fairfax builds to 18.7% as the company\u2019s shares plunge below 60 cents. July 2012 Rinehart dumps part of her stake in Fairfax, reducing her holding back below 15%, with its shares at 58.5 cents. Later in the month, Rinehart ally Jack Cowin joins the Fairfax board. August 2012 Rinehart sends letters to small Fairfax shareholders urging them to support her bid for board seats and that the charter of independence should be optional for directors to sign. December 2012 Rinehart\u2019s friend John Singleton buys a toe-hold stake in Fairfax. Its shares are trading at 47.5 cents. September 2013 News Ltd reports that Rinehart has considered a full takeover of Fairfax. Its shares recover to more than 80 cents. Timeline courtesy of the Australian Financial Review",

      "body": "<p>The mining billionaire Gina Rinehart is selling her A$306m (\u00a3156m) stake in Fairfax Media after more than four years of fraught relations with the owner of the Sydney Morning Herald, according to reports.</p> <p>Rinehart, Australia\u2019s richest person, sold her 14.99% stake at 86.75 Australian cents a share, below the 96 cents closing price. Her company blamed falling revenues and bad business decisions at Fairfax for her decision to sell.</p> <p>John Klepec, chief development officer at Rinehart\u2019s Hancock Prospecting, said Fairfax management had no workable plan to revive the company and deal with declining business and circulation.</p> <p>\u201cA series of bad decisions made by the leadership team has instead increased the number of publication errors and reduced the company\u2019s performance to cover news to standards expected to maintain the credibility of some of the oldest and finest newspaper mastheads in the country,\u201d he said, according to The Australian.</p> <p>Rinehart, whose fortune is estimated at A$11.7bn (\u00a37.6bn) by Forbes, clashed frequently with Fairfax\u2019s chairman, Roger Corbett. He denied Rinehart a seat on the board after she refused to sign Fairfax\u2019s editorial independence charter.</p> <p>Rinehart began buying shares in Fairfax in late 2010, acquiring a 1.5% stake a day after the sudden departure of its chief executive, Brian McCarthy. Rinehart became the company\u2019s biggest shareholder in February 2012 when she bought a 14% stake and went on to build her holding to 18.7% in June 2012.</p> <p>She was believed to be planning a takeover of Fairfax before she reduced her stake below 15%. Fairfax\u2019s insurance policy did not protect directors holding more than 15% of a company from potential lawsuits.</p> <p>Fairfax\u2019s newspapers also include Melbourne\u2019s The Age and it also owns business magazines, radio stations and a digital operation.</p> <p>Rinehart has retained her position at the top of Australia\u2019s rich list despite a A$6bn fall in her fortune caused by the plunging price of iron ore.</p> <h2>Hard history</h2> <p><strong>December 2010</strong> Rinehart revealed as buyer of an A$50m, or 1.5%, stake in the company a day after the abrupt departure of its chief executive.</p> <p><strong>January 2011</strong> Rinehart continues building her stake and owns 4% by the end of the month.</p> <p><strong>February 2012</strong> Increases her stake to 14%, with Fairfax shares climbing back above 81 cents.</p> <p><strong>March 2012</strong> Rinehart requests seats on the company\u2019s board.</p> <p><strong>June 2012 </strong>Reports emerge that Corbett is blocking Rinehart\u2019s request for board representation, and that she has refused to sign the Fairfax board\u2019s editorial independence charter. Rinehart says there are \u201cquestions to be raised concerning the current chairmanship\u201d of Fairfax and later calls for Corbett to be subject to \u201cperformance milestones\u201d.</p> <p>During the month Rinehart\u2019s holding in Fairfax builds to 18.7% as the company\u2019s shares plunge below 60 cents.</p> <p><strong>July 2012</strong> Rinehart dumps part of her stake in Fairfax, reducing her holding back below 15%, with its shares at 58.5 cents. Later in the month, Rinehart ally Jack Cowin joins the Fairfax board.</p> <p><strong>August 2012</strong> Rinehart sends letters to small Fairfax shareholders urging them to support her bid for board seats and that the charter of independence should be optional for directors to sign.</p> <p><strong>December 2012</strong> Rinehart\u2019s friend John Singleton buys a toe-hold stake in Fairfax. Its shares are trading at 47.5 cents.</p> <p><strong>September 2013</strong> News Ltd reports that Rinehart has considered a full takeover of Fairfax. Its shares recover to more than 80 cents.</p> <p><strong>Timeline courtesy of the Australian Financial Review</strong></p>",

      "bodyText": "The US economy added 257,000 jobs in January, beating expectations of 230,000 jobs and giving the market renewed confidence in the health of the nation\u2019s economy. The Labor Department also revised jobs data from for November and December to show 147,000 more jobs were created than previously estimated. The revised figures for November show 423,000 jobs were created \u2013 the most since May 2010. \u201cWith today\u2019s strong employment report, we have now seen eleven straight months of job gains above 200,000 \u2013 the first time that has happened in nearly two decades,\u201d wrote Jason Furman, chairman of the White House\u2019s council of economic advisers. The private sector has now added 11.8m jobs over 59 straight months of job growth, extending the longest streak on record. \u201cWe keep trying to tell everyone that the US economy is enjoying a period of unusual strength; maybe now people will believe us,\u201d said Paul Ashworth, chief US economist at thinktank Capital Economics. \u201cThe economy is doing so well that it has created more than 1 million additional jobs in the last three months alone. That\u2019s the strongest pace of job growth we\u2019ve seen since 1997.\u201d January\u2019s increase was the biggest since November 2008, and the 11th straight month that more than 200,000 new jobs were created \u2013 the longest consecutive streak since 1994. Despite the increase in new jobs, the unemployment rate increased slightly from 5.6% to 5.7%. Wages also increased, with average hourly earnings for all employees on private nonfarm payrolls up 12 cents to $24.75, following a decrease of 5 cents in December. Over the last 12 month average wages have increased by 2.2%, up from a previous estimate of 1.9%. David Lamb, senior dealer at the foreign exchange specialists Fexco, said: \u201cSeldom do economists get everything they want. Yet today might just be one of those days. \u201cAmerica\u2019s straight-A jobs report sent the markets and the dollar soaring \u2013 with the Greenback spiking 1% against the euro within minutes. With wages rising and the rate of job creation kicking into overdrive, even the most bearish will struggle to find fault with this latest snapshot of the US economy.\u201d This strong jobs report raises the probability that the US Federal Reserve may start to raise interest rates, which have been kept near zero since 2008. \u201c[The] very strong labour market report has put a June rate hike by the Fed back into the picture after a month of rather disappointing data,\u201d Rob Carnell, chief international economist at ING, said. \u201cWith wages turning higher, the Fed can justify ignoring the plummeting headline inflation rate, and instead, focus more on core inflation and wages. A little bit of more positive activity data would also help the Fed hawks. \u201cAbout the only fly in the ointment in this release was the unemployment rate, and even this is really evidence more of the huge surge in the labour force [up by more than 1m] ... Such a rise is probably statistical noise, but it could also be evidence of greater optimism about the chances of gaining work, and a return to the labour market by marginally inactive people.\u201d Ashworth added: \u201cEmployment growth is clearly on fire and its beginning to put upward pressure on wage growth. The Fed can\u2019t wait much longer in that environment, particularly not when interest rates are starting at near-zero.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Britain\u2019s trade deficit last year was the widest since the coalition came to power, dealing a blow to the government\u2019s drive to rebalance the economy away from consumer spending. Official figures released on Friday showed a trading deficit for goods and services of \u00a334.8bn in 2014, and make disappointing reading for the Conservative party as it seeks to capitalise on its economic record ahead of May\u2019s election. Despite a vow to revive manufacturing and raise exports, the trade deficit last year was the widest since 2010 as exports fell faster than imports. The news prompted fresh calls for export support from the British Chambers of Commerce. The business lobby group\u2019s chief economist, David Kern, said: \u201cWe are clearly not making adequate progress in rebalancing our economy, and the weakening of the eurozone is creating problems for our exporters. Much greater efforts are needed to develop a national strategy for boosting exports, with improved access to finance for growing firms.\u201d For December, a surge in imports of cheap oil meant the year ended on a weak note for trade. Goods exports barely increased while imports jumped, leaving the trade gap much bigger than economists had been expecting. The deficit on goods widened to \u00a310.2bn in December from \u00a39.3bn in November, worse than the \u00a39.1bn gap economists had forecast in a Reuters poll. The widening came as goods exports rose by less than \u00a30.1bn with imports rising \u00a30.9bn \u2013 \u00a30.7bn of which was fuel imports, mostly from Norway. Oil imports reached their highest level since July 2008, growing 37.5% between November and December, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said. Economists cautioned against reading too much into the monthly figures, which are typically erratic. December\u2019s were distorted by oil, which has more than halved in price since a peak last summer. They noted that over the final three months of 2014 the deficit narrowed by the biggest amount for three years, raising hopes trade will have helped boost wider economic growth in the closing quarter. \u201cWhile December\u2019s trade data make for disappointing reading, the surge in oil imports masks a more encouraging underlying picture,\u201d said Paul Hollingsworth, UK economist at Capital Economics. \u201cThe overall trade deficit actually narrowed from \u00a38.7bn in the third quarter to \u00a37.1bn in the fourth quarter. What\u2019s more, the volume of goods exports rose by 4.4% in the fourth quarter, whilst the volume of imports rose by 1.4%, suggesting that net trade made a decent contribution to GDP growth over the quarter as a whole.\u201d The overall trade deficit of \u00a334.8bn compares with a figure of \u00a333.7bn for 2013. Both exports and imports fell in 2014 when compared with 2013, but exports fell more, the ONS said. Forecasting the outlook for this year, economists said exports would come under pressure from a stronger pound and a slowdown in important markets, especially the UK\u2019s main trading partner, the eurozone. \u201cThis trend of weak overall trade performance is likely to continue this year,\u201d said Rob Harbron at the Centre for Economics and Business Research. \u201cThe eurozone remains unlikely to see much of an acceleration in growth in 2015, particularly given the uncertainty being generated by the prospect of a Greek exit from the single currency area. In addition, economic expansion is expected to continue cooling in China over the medium term, weighing down on export prospects there.\u201d",

The company has suspended truck deliveries of crude for overseas markets in favour of local sales because it is still waiting for export payments from the Kurdish government. It said it was in talks with the government about the outstanding money and about a stable payment cycle for future payments. It said the suspension was likely to be a short term measure and added: The company is actively working towards an early pipeline access solution for Shaikan [its main producing asset] crude which will provide significantly improved margins that trucking to the export market. It said it was taking a prudent approach to capital expenditure and added: A number of longer term financing options are currently being progressed by the board. Falling crude prices have hit oil companies, prompting investments to be cancelled and jobs to be cut. In Iraq there is also the difficulty of the autonomous Kurdish government\u2019s claim for oil independence, which lead to a temporary agreement with Bagdhad in December after the two sides had been in dispute over the issue. The news has sent Gulf Keystone\u2019s shares down 4.75p or 9% at 47.75p although they have recovered from their lowest level of 43.25p earlier in the day. Analysts at SP Angel said: Today\u2019s news from the Company reminds us that it\u2019s difficult enough with the current all price environment, let alone with the geopolitical environment swirling around Kurdistan presently. While Genel have proven that you can export at least 70m barrels a day by truck, a pipeline solution would significantly reduce operating costs and improve deliverability. There have been a significant number of hurdles for the company to overcome in the past and the current operating environment (made more difficult by ISIL\u2019s involvement) is not conducive to allowing a see-through valuation of the company\u2019s underlying asset. While we believe that current valuation the company represents an opportune time to invest, such is the discount to where we believe the value of the company lies and so extreme are the topsides threats, that until such times as they stabilise, it\u2019s hard to recommend that anybody but the bravest and most long-term investor increase their exposure to the stock. Westhouse Securities analyst Jamal Orazbayeva said: Although the sales into domestic market is expected to be a short term measure until a regular payment cycle can be established for sales via the export route, Gulf\u2019s margins will be diminished further.

Aside from the current issue with payments, Gulf is still in a less advantageous position as it still needs access to a pipeline, which once again may take some time to address. Cantor Fitzgerald was more positive, with analyst Sam Wahab saying: Historically 100% of Shaikan production was being trucked to the Turkish port of Dortyol and sold to the international market by an authorised transportation and marketing agent of the Kurdish government. These export crude oil deliveries by truck have been temporarily suspended, but this is expected to be a short-term measure, until a regular payment cycle can be established.

      "bodyText": "Shoppers at 99p Stores can expect an inflation-busting price rise to \u00a31 per item after its larger rival Poundland announced plans to buy the chain for \u00a355m. If the deal goes ahead, the 99p Stores will be rebranded as Poundland, as part of the larger group\u2019s ambition to build a 1,000-strong chain to cash in on consumer\u2019s growing demand for value shopping. The company currently has about 600 outlets, while 99p Stores has 251. Poundland\u2019s shares soared 13% to 404.5p. The proposed deal is a cash and shares transaction. Poundland has said it will pay \u00a347.5m in cash, and offer new Poundland shares worth \u00a37.5m. The 99p Stores chain is owned by the Lalani familyand based in Northampton. The business was founded in 2001 by Nadir Lalani, who arrived in the UK from Tanzania in the 1970s and built and sold two convenience store chains before starting 99p Stores. Helped by his sons Hussein and Faisal, he opened his first single price 99p shop was in Holloway, north London, and within a year he had four. The chain has grown rapidly in recent years, following the demise of Woolworths in 2008, and as bargain retailers become regular fixtures on UK high streets. It now also includes a number of stores which operate under the Family Bargains name and which are not restricted to a single price point. Jim McCarthy, Poundland\u2019s chief executive, said the deal would benefit customers and shareholders of both businesses: \u201cPeople are ever-more price conscious, shopping around for bargains. Through working together, Poundland will improve choice, value and service for 99p Stores\u2019 customers, bringing Poundland\u2019s proven knowhow and range to 99p Stores. We also believe that we can improve the performance of the 99p Stores estate and generate further value for Poundland\u2019s shareholders.\u201d Despite disappointing investors with a recent trading update, Poundland continues to win business from high street rivals, especially the supermarkets.. 99p Stores serves more than 2m customers. Last year its sales topped \u00a3370m with underlying earnings at just over \u00a36m. Poundland, which floated on the stock market last year, would also acquire a warehouse and distribution centre in the transaction. The deal will be subject to close scrutiny from the Competition and Markets Authority, a process expected to last at least two months. McCarthy said Poundland\u2019s long-established presence in the single-price retail market would benefit 99p Stores and its customers. \u201cWe\u2019ve been going 25 years so we\u2019ve amassed a lot more experience.\u201d He said its direct relationship with key suppliers such as Coca-Cola, Procter &amp; Gamble, Walkers, Mondelez, and GlaxoSmithKline would be among the benefits it could offer 99p Stores. He said Poundland was also developing its own product ranges, from nuts to a DIY range with Tommy Walsh, who featured on the BBC\u2019s former show Ground Force. \u201cIf you look at the two businesses, in terms of infrastructure we have a lot more resource to develop and invest in innovation,\u201d McCarthy said. He said it was too early to say what steps it might have to take in terms of store closures to get the CMA\u2019s seal of approval. McCarthy said a tie-up made geographic sense because 99 Stores would accelerate Poundland\u2019s ambitions to expand in the south. Poundland employs about 13,000 people, while 99 Stores has 5,000 staff.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The top tax partner at PricewaterhouseCoopers, Kevin Nicholson, misled parliament over complex Luxembourg financing structures the accountancy firm helped to set up for scores of multinationals to avoid tax, according to MPs. In a report published on Friday, the public accounts committee dismisses Nicholson\u2019s repeated claims that PwC was not in the business of selling tax avoidance. MPs pointed to evidence unearthed in investigations published in November in the Guardian and more than 20 news outlets around the world, under the auspices of the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ). Committee chair Margaret Hodge said: \u201cContrary to its denials, the tax arrangements PwC promotes, based on artificially diverting profits to Luxembourg through intra-company loans, bear all the characteristics of a mass-marketed tax avoidance scheme.\u201d Nicholson had been recalled to give further evidence last December after MPs felt his 2013 evidence had been put in question by the Guardian\u2019s investigations. Fearghas Carruthers, the head of tax at drug firm Shire, a PwC client which also featured in the investigation, gave evidence too. Two years ago Nicholson told MPs: \u201cWe are not in the business of selling schemes. We do not mass-market tax products, we do not produce tax products, we do not promote tax products.\u201d The MPs\u2019 report comes as political leaders in the European parliament promised their own special committee to examine tax rulings granted not just by Luxembourg, but by all member states. The special committee\u2019s work will last a year and it has powers to examine a wide range of paperwork at the European level. The move disappointed many MEPs, however, as more than a quarter had petitioned for leaders to endorse a full committee of inquiry, with powers to review papers from member states as well as internal Brussels documents. The Guardian\u2019s investigation into PwC\u2019s activities in Luxembourg was made possible by the leak of thousands of pages of confidential tax rulings secured by the accountancy firm, which found their way to the ICIJ. In a statement responding to MPs\u2019 criticisms of Nicholson, PwC once again said: \u201cWe stand by the evidence we gave the committee and disagree with its conclusions about the work we do.\u201d The statement added: \u201cWe recognise we need to do more to explain the positive role we play in the tax system and in helping businesses to operate successfully.\u201d But PwC Luxembourg remains furious at what it calls the \u201ctheft\u201d of its documents. Criminal charges have been brought against two former PwC staff members after it complained to prosecutors. Of Shire\u2019s Luxembourg structure, the MPs\u2019 report says: \u201cShire has arranged its affairs so that interest payments on intra-company loans reduce significantly its overall tax liabilities \u2026 The \u2018substance\u2019 of Shire\u2019s business in Luxembourg, used to justify these arrangements, consists of two people \u2026 One of Shire\u2019s Luxembourg based staff holds 41 directorships of other companies.\u201d The report recommends that British tax authorities should press for tougher international rules that would require multinationals to show real substance in companies where their profits arise.",

Criminal charges have been brought against two former PwC staff members after it complained to prosecutors.</p> <p>Of Shire\u2019s Luxembourg structure, the MPs\u2019 report says: \u201cShire has arranged its affairs so that interest payments on intra-company loans reduce significantly its overall tax liabilities \u2026 The \u2018substance\u2019 of Shire\u2019s business in Luxembourg, used to justify these arrangements, consists of two people \u2026 One of Shire\u2019s Luxembourg based staff holds 41 directorships of other companies.\u201d</p> <p>The report recommends that British tax authorities should press for tougher international rules that would require multinationals to show real substance in companies where their profits arise.</p>",
