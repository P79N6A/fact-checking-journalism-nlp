The National Association of Pension Funds, which looks after \u00a31tn of investments, also called for a better link between directors' pay and performance as it assessed the annual general meeting season, which is drawing to a close. Pension fund managers listed eight companies that have had standoffs with investors for two successive years \u2013 easyJet, Capital &amp; Counties Properties, bus and train operator FirstGroup, mining group Lonmin, outsourcer Mitie Group, online grocer Ocado, oil and gas group Ophir Energy and private equity company SVG Capital. The association looked back at companies where at least 20% of shareholders failed to back bosses' pay last year followed by at least 15% withholding support this year \u2013 although it noted that easyJet and SVG each have a major investor leading the dissent. For the first time this year companies were required to put two pay issues to a vote: the remuneration report, which showed how directors and staff were paid in the past financial year; and the remuneration policy, which sets how the directors will be paid over the next three years. The vote on the former is advisory, so is only able to show the level of dissent, while the latter is binding, meaning a rebellion forces companies back to the drawing board to design new pay deals. \"To receive significant shareholder dissent on remuneration one year might be regarded as a misfortune, but to do so a second year really does not reflect well,\" said Will Pomroy, corporate governance expert at the association. \"We urge all those firms whose shareholders have so clearly signalled their dissatisfaction this year to begin in earnest a conversation to resolve the concerns well ahead of next year's AGM season.\" The engineering firm Kentz was the first company in the FTSE 350 to have its remuneration policy voted down \u2013 it also faced dissent over its remuneration report \u2013 while FTSE 100 company Burberry had its pay report voted down. The level of dissent is lower than during the so-called shareholder spring of 2012. The association also tracked which companies encountered dissent on issues other than pay and found that nine in the FTSE 350 had experienced protests on a recurring resolution \u2013 such as an election of a director \u2013 and that four of them did so again this season. Even so, the association found that investors showed \"reticence\" when it came to voting against individual directors, even when there were recurring issues.",

      "bodyText": "Phones 4u's founder has blamed the retailer's collapse on its mobile network suppliers and private equity owners, after the chain shut its 550 stores on Monday, leaving more than 5,000 jobs under threat. John Caudwell, who started the chain of phone shops in the 1980s and sold it for \u00a31.5bn in 2006, said Vodafone, EE and other networks had refused to supply the retailer, in a strategy to reduce competition and fatten their margins. He also said Phones 4u's owners, private equity group BC Partners, left the company financially weakened so that it could not defend itself. \"It's astonishingly ruthless. Vodafone have had millions upon millions from Phones 4u over 25 years,\" said Caudwell. \"It's dreadful for British business. It gives us a terrible reputation, it destroys jobs and it's a terribly unhealthy environment to do business in. \"The private equity houses left the business laden with debt and that weakened their ability to defend themselves and fight.\" Caudwell intervened after recriminations flew between Phones 4u and BC on one side and Vodafone and EE on the other as the retailer was put into administration. Phones 4u shut its stores after it lost a crucial contract with EE, the final blow to its business model of selling phone contracts for major network operators. PwC, the accountancy firm, was confirmed as the administrator for Phones 4u's 720 outlets, including 550 of its own stores. Rob Hunt, joint administrator and PwC partner, said: \"This is a very sad day for the business and the many people working there. Our initial focus will be to quickly engage with parties who may be interested in acquiring all or part of the business, and to better understand the financial position and options for the company. The stores will remain closed while we have these conversations.\" Hunt said PwC would hold talks with network operators and suppliers to seek funds to pay wages owed to Phones 4u's 5,596 employees. \"These conversations will determine whether we can reopen stores and trade, and also if and when we can pay the arrears of wages to employees. Our hope is that we will be able to pay all the outstanding wages arrears.\" Phones 4u's owner, BC executive Stefano Quadrio Curzio, attacked EE and Vodafone, which had traditionally favoured Phones 4u over its larger rival, Carphone Warehouse, for selling mobile phones and contracts to customers. Phones 4u then received a commission from mobile phone networks for each sale. He said: \"Vodafone has acted in exactly the opposite way to what they had consistently indicated to the management of Phones 4u over more than six months. \"Their behaviour appears to have been designed to inflict the maximum damage to their partner of 15 years, giving Phones 4u no time to develop commercial alternatives. EE's decision on Friday is surprising in the context of a contract that has more than a year to run.\" Vodafone and a source close to EE hit back, saying Phones 4u management blamed their inability to come up with an acceptable deal on the company's heavy debt. Vodafone said: \"Phones4u was offered repeated opportunities to propose competitive distribution terms to enable us to conclude a new agreement, but was unable to do so on terms which were commercially viable.\" Sources close to Phones 4u said the companies had agreed distribution terms informally, but that the deal was not sealed because Vodafone and EE had considered buying Phones 4u in early summer. Vodafone and EE acknowledged they considered buying the retailer, but said there were too many legal hurdles. Phones 4u earned more than \u00a3100m in profits before tax, debt interest and other items last year, but its business was crippled after EE decided to stop selling through its outlets. Vodafone withdrew its business a fortnight ago. O2 stopped selling through Phones 4u earlier this year and the network 3 some time before that. BC bought Phones 4u in 2011 for \u20ac770m (\u00a3610m), leaving the business with debts of \u00a3635m. A year ago, BC recouped all the money it paid for Phones 4u when the retailer issued \u00a3200m of bonds that were used to pay BC a one-off dividend. Networks, hit by regulated price cuts, have been looking for savings, including the use of third-party resellers. Carphone's decision to merge with Dixons is thought to have been prompted by unrest among the mobile networks whose connections it sells.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "A fight for control of the world's beer industry appeared on the verge of breaking out as UK-based SABMiller, the world's second-largest brewer, became the latest London-listed company to be eyed up for takeover. Shares in the maker of Peroni, Grolsch and Miller Lite soared on the London stock exchange by almost 10% on Monday, pushing the company's value up to \u00a355bn as traders sensed it had become more vulnerable to a takeover by its larger rival, Anheuser-Busch InBev, the owner of Budweiser. The frenzy followed the collapse of SAB's efforts to buy rival Heineken \u2013 a deal that had been viewed by the City as a possible defence against a foreign takeover. In what appeared to be an unambiguous rejection of SAB's approach to Heineken, the Dutch company said: \"The Heineken family has informed SABMiller \u2026 of its intention to preserve the heritage and identity of Heineken as an independent company. The Heineken family and Heineken NV's management are confident that the company will continue to deliver growth and shareholder value.\" The snub immediately revived speculation that SAB would become a takeover target itself, especially as one of the potential barriers to it being swallowed by its larger rival had been removed. And the Wall Street Journal reported that AB InBev was talking to banks about raising finance for an acquisition, citing a possible \u00a375bn price tag. Eddy Hargreaves, an analyst with investment bank Canaccord Genuity, wrote in a note to clients: \"The press leak and seeming misjudgment by SABMiller in making its approach put SABMiller's management in an uncomfortable position. The Heineken move appears motivated to a significant degree by defensive thinking \u2013 not necessarily at the top of its shareholders' agenda. That SABMiller's inorganic options have been so publicly lessened puts [AB InBev] in an even stronger position, should it choose to make a move on SABMiller.\" A tie-up between the world's two largest brewers has been rumoured for years, but the speculation has been revived by the surge in international mergers this year. The Journal added that AB InBev was not in active discussions with SABMiller, but was attempting to line up financing before making a formal approach. Both companies declined to comment. However, other analysts said SABMiller might now turn its attention on trying to take over Castel, the 80%-family owned French beer and wine group, in which it already owns a 20% stake. Jonathan Fyfe, an analyst at Mirabaud Securities, said such a deal would require taking on significant debt for SAB: \"It would be quite a big deal for SAB to take control of [Castel]. It would involve leveraging up, which might put [AB] InBev off.\" SABMiller declined to comment on its future intentions, but a company insider said: \"We look at a lot of things a lot of the time.

      "body": "<p>A fight for control of the world's beer industry appeared on the verge of breaking out as UK-based SABMiller, the world's second-largest brewer, became the latest London-listed company to be eyed up for takeover.</p> <p>Shares in the maker of Peroni, Grolsch and Miller Lite soared on the London stock exchange by almost 10% on Monday, pushing the company's value up to \u00a355bn as traders sensed it had become more vulnerable to a takeover by its larger rival, Anheuser-Busch InBev, the owner of Budweiser.</p> <p>The frenzy followed the collapse of SAB's efforts to buy rival Heineken \u2013 a deal that had been viewed by the City as a possible defence against a foreign takeover.</p> <p>In what appeared to be an unambiguous rejection of SAB's approach to Heineken, the Dutch company said: \"The Heineken family has informed SABMiller \u2026 of its intention to preserve the heritage and identity of Heineken as an independent company. The Heineken family and Heineken NV's management are confident that the company will continue to deliver growth and shareholder value.\"</p> <p>The snub immediately revived speculation that SAB would become a takeover target itself, especially as one of the potential barriers to it being swallowed by its larger rival had been removed.</p> <p>And the Wall Street Journal reported that AB InBev was talking to banks about raising finance for an acquisition, citing a possible \u00a375bn price tag.</p> <p>Eddy Hargreaves, an analyst with investment bank Canaccord Genuity, wrote in a note to clients: \"The press leak and seeming misjudgment by SABMiller in making its approach put SABMiller's management in an uncomfortable position. The Heineken move appears motivated to a significant degree by defensive thinking \u2013 not necessarily at the top of its shareholders' agenda. That SABMiller's inorganic options have been so publicly lessened puts [AB InBev] in an even stronger position, should it choose to make a move on SABMiller.\"</p> <p>A tie-up between the world's two largest brewers has been rumoured for years, but the speculation has been revived by the surge in international mergers this year. The Journal added that AB InBev was not in active discussions with SABMiller, but was attempting to line up financing before making a formal approach. Both companies declined to comment.</p> <p>However, other analysts said SABMiller might now turn its attention on trying to take over Castel, the 80%-family owned French beer and wine group, in which it already owns a 20% stake.</p> <p>Jonathan Fyfe, an analyst at Mirabaud Securities, said such a deal would require taking on significant debt for SAB: \"It would be quite a big deal for SAB to take control of [Castel]. It would involve leveraging up, which might put [AB] InBev off.\"</p> <p>SABMiller declined to comment on its future intentions, but a company insider said: \"We look at a lot of things a lot of the time. We have a corporate finance team looking at these things all the time. It may be that there is a further acquisition on the horizon, maybe not.

Total industrial production was down 0.1 percent in August, also the first setback for the overall figure since January. Output was up in mining and utility production but these gains were not enough to offset the decline in manufacturing.</p> <p>Output of motor vehicles and parts dropped 7.6 percent after a 9.3 percent increase in July. The reversal was not viewed as worrisome. The July figure was boosted because many plants did not shut down as they normally do to retool for new models. That made August look weaker.</p> <p>Economists had been looking for a weaker figure for factory output in August as auto activity returned to more normal levels. The fact that there were fewer plant shutdowns in July made output look stronger after the government adjusted the figure for normal seasonal variations. And that seasonal adjustment then made the August figures look weaker.</p> <p>Outside of manufacturing, output at utilities rose 1 percent after a big 2.7 percent drop in July which reflected cooler-than-normal temperatures that month.

takeover talk, after Heineken bid rejected</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Is the hunter about to turn into the hunted?</strong><br></p> <p>Shares in British brewing giant SABMiller have jumped by<strong> 5%</strong> today, after an attempt to merge with Heineken was rebuffed.</p> <p>Dutch firm Heineken announced last night that it had rejected an approach from SAB, the world\u2019s second-largest brewer by revenue. </p> <p>Analysts say that SAB was keen to merge with Heineken to protect itself against a takeover offer from <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/quote/ABI:BB\">Anheuser-Busch InBev,</a> the world\u2019s biggest brewer.</p> <p>With the family that controls Heineken determined to \u201cpreserve the heritage and

class=\"quoted\"> <p>\u201cSAB is the leading asset that everybody wants to own,\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIf you are InBev looking to truly build a global brewer, which they have been doing in recent years, the next asset that ABI would want to buy is SAB.\u201d</p> </blockquote> <p>SAB\u2019s brands include <em>Pilsner Urquell</em>, <em>Peroni Nastro Azzurro</em>, <em>Miller</em> and <em>Grolsch</em>.</p> <p><strong>Heineken\u2019s</strong> shares are up 1.4% today.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\"

      "bodyText": "And finally, another business leader has entered the debate on Scottish independence. The head of Aviva, Mark Wilson, is the latest to flag up concerns over Thursday\u2019s referendum, telling the BBC\u2019s Kamal Ahmed that he\u2019s worried that infrastructure funding (building of schools, hospitals and roads) could become more expensive.: \u201cOther commentators have pointed out the challenges that the Scottish financial system will face in the event of a yes vote\u201d \u201cAviva is a long-standing investor in Scottish infrastructure and we will maintain our commitment.\u201d The comments come as David Cameron campaigns for a No vote in Scotland: European stock markets ended the day pretty calmly, as investors prepare for drama later this week. Jasper Lawler , market analyst at CMC Markets, says worries over weak Chinese factory data were balanced by the takeover talk in the brewing industry: Trading in Europe has been mixed today with M&amp;A speculation amongst brewers mixing in with fears over a slowdown in China which added to a general uncertainty heading into the Scottish referendum and this month\u2019s Fed meeting. OK, time to recap the key points. 1) The OECD cast a shadow over the global economy by cutting its growth forecasts for most major countries today. OECD deputy secretary-general Rintaro Tamaki said: \u201cThe global economy is expanding unevenly, and at only a moderate rate. Trade growth therefore remains sluggish and labour market conditions in the main advanced economies are improving only gradually, with far too many people still unable to find good jobs worldwide. \u201cThe continued failure to generate strong, balanced and inclusive growth underlines the urgency of undertaking ambitious reforms.\u201d The Paris-based thinktank warned that the eurozone remains weak, and at risk of deflation.... ....and also cited the Scottish referendum as a threat to the recovery. 2) Economists are urging investors not to panic after US industrial output fell unexpectedly last month. Unusual activity in the auto industry is being blamed. More encouragingly, the Empire Survey of factories in the New York region has hit a near five-year high. 3) But the latest Chinese factory data has also showed a surprise slowdown, hitting Asian markets overnight. 4) Shares in SABMiller have surged 10% on reports that the world\u2019s largest brewer, AB InBev, is considering a takeover bid. Analysts say SAB\u2019s failed bid for Heineken, which emerged yesterday, may rebound on it. The deal could value SAB at \u00a375bn. It would bring together many of the world\u2019s biggest drinks brands. 5) Thousands of Phones 4u staff, and many more customers, face uncertainty after it announced it was calling in the administrators. Stores remained shut today. Dixons Carphone, its high street rival, has said it will hire hundreds of staff, while Phones 4u has promised to refund orders. 6) The Brent crude oil price hit its lowest level in 27 months this morning, but has risen back over the $97 per barrel mark now. 7) And Microsoft is buying the software firm that developed Minecraft in a $2.5bn deal, turning the founder of the Stockholm-base firm into a dollar billionaire. Here\u2019s Associated Press\u2019s take on the US factory data: US factory output drops 0.4 percent in August U.S. manufacturing output declined in August for the first time in seven months, reflecting a sharp fall in production at auto plants that was due mainly to seasonal adjustment problems. Output at manufacturing plants fell 0.4 percent in August after a 0.7 percent rise in July, the Federal Reserve reported Monday. Total industrial production was down 0.1 percent in August, also the first setback for the overall figure since January. Output was up in mining and utility production but these gains were not enough to offset the decline in manufacturing. Output of motor vehicles and parts dropped 7.6 percent after a 9.3 percent increase in July. The reversal was not viewed as worrisome. The July figure was boosted because many plants did not shut down as they normally do to retool for new models. That made August look weaker. Economists had been looking for a weaker figure for factory output in August as auto activity returned to more normal levels. The fact that there were fewer plant shutdowns in July made output look stronger after the government adjusted the figure for normal seasonal variations. And that seasonal adjustment then made the August figures look weaker. Outside of manufacturing, output at utilities rose 1 percent after a big 2.7 percent drop in July which reflected cooler-than-normal temperatures that month. Output in mining, a category that includes oil and gas production, rose 0.5 percent in August after a 0.3 percent drop in July. Paul Dales, senior U.S. economist at Capital Economics, said he was not overly concerned by the dip in industrial production because it reflected a temporary seasonal adjustment problem. He said gains in a number of industries outside of autos \u201cunderlines that industry remains healthy.\u201d A broad increase in manufacturing this year has pointed to stronger growth across the economy, suggesting that manufacturers expect business investment and consumer spending to improve in the coming months. Capital Economics agrees that we shouldn\u2019t panic, saying: The fall in industrial production in August was just due to problems seasonally adjusting autos production and is therefore not a sign that the recovery is running out of steam. The more upbeat survey evidence emphasises that industry remains healthy. Rob Carnell of ING reckons we shouldn\u2019t get too alarmed by the unexpected drop in US industrial production last month. He reckons it\u2019s a rogue reading, partly due to a seasonal slowdown in the automobile industry. Carnell told clients that: A 0.1% month-on-month decline in US manufacturing production in August and a 0.4%mom decline in manufacturing in particular, are at complete odds with survey evidence and almost certainly an aberration that either reflects payback from the 0.7%mom manufacturing gain in July, poor seasonal adjustment (seasonal auto shutdowns in July may be being over-adjusted in July and weighing on the August numbers), statistical noise, or a bit of all of the above. The polls show it\u2019s neck-and-neck, but the feeling in the City is still that the Better Together side will win Thursday\u2019s Scottish referendum: Here\u2019s our news story on the speculation that SABMiller could be a takeover target (see 12.34pm onwards for details) SABMiller shares leap 12% on AB InBev takeover rumours What were we saying about the US recovery looking solid? Industrial output across the entire American economy fell by 0.1% in August, the first monthly drop since January 2014, according to data just released. Weaker car manufacturing is the main cause: More takeover news: Microsoft has just announced the acquisition of Mojang, the Stockholm-based software firm, for $2.5bn. Mojang is the firm behind the hugely popular Minecraft brick-based online building game (a bit like Lego, but without the danger of tripping over half-constructed masterpieces) The deal is expected to close by the end of 2014. It will make founder Marcus Persson a billionaire, according to Forbes. Microsoft has pledged to continue to make Minecraft available across all the platforms it currently runs on. Analysts at Grupo Santander also reckon merger fever is alike in the brewing sector, triggered by SAB Miller\u2019s\u2019s failed attempt to merge with Heineken: \u201cIf the wheels were not yet in motion on another brewing mega-deal, they may be now as SABMiller may have thrown down the gauntlet.\u201d Phones 4u\u2019s 500 stores are shuttered today, after the company took the shock decision to call in administrators after the loss of its contract with mobile operator EE left it unable to serve customers. At at least one branch, staff have pinned the customer message that is also displayed on its website today. Dixons Carphone, meanwhile, has thrown staff a lifeline: Dixons Carphone ready to hire Phones 4u staff Another sign that the US recovery remains solid -- the Empire manufacturing survey, produced by the New York Federal Reserve, has bounced back this month to a near five-year high. The Empire survey, which takes the temperature of factories in the New York area, jumped to +27.54, up from +14.69 in August. Any reading above zero suggests conditions have improved. The pick-up was driven by a rise in prices received by manufacturers. The new orders index also rose, but the employment measure deteriorated. SABMiller and Anheuser-Busch InBev may not be household names, but between them they own many of the world\u2019s biggest beer brands. AB InBev\u2019s range includes lagers such as Budweiser, Stella Artois and Michelob, while it also European classics like L\u00f6wenbr\u00e4u and Leffe. SAB produces a range of Miller drinks, lagers including Pilsner Urquell and Peroni Nastro Azzurro. It also makes Snow, sold only in China, which it dubs \u201cThe biggest beer brand you\u2019ve never heard of.\u201d City traders have been anticipating a takeover battle in the brewing sector since it emerged last night that SABMiller had made an unsuccessful bid for Heineken. Alastair McCaig, market analyst at IG, says: Over the weekend we have seen SAB Miller rebuffed in its attempts to woe Heineken, with the Danish brewer\u2019s major shareholder preferring to remain independent. If the M&amp;A activity witnessed in the pharmaceutical sector this year is anything to go by then this will not be the last we hear about this. It\u2019s early days, but if Anheuser-Busch InBev do launch a bid for SABMiller then we\u2019d be looking at one of the biggest takeover offers ever. Before today\u2019s 12% surge, SAB will valued at almost \u00a355bn. The WSJ reports that AB are talking to banks about a possible \u00a375bn offer -- that\u2019s \u00a36bn more than Pfizer\u2019s recent failed bid for AstraZeneca. Shares in SABMiller have extended their earlier gains, now up 12% today as takeover speculation swirls through the brewing sector. They surged a few minute ago, after the Wall Street Journal reported that Anheuser-Busch InBev, the world\u2019s biggest brewer, was looking into getting financing for a bid for SAB. The WSJ says that: Anheuser-Busch InBev is talking to banks about financing what could be a roughly \u00a375 billion ($122 billion) deal to buy global beer rival SABMiller, according to a person familiar with the matter. A tie-up between the world\u2019s two largest brewing companies has been rumored for years, but a revival in global merger activity this year has sparked renewed speculation about a deal. AB InBev isn\u2019t in active discussions with SABMiller, said the person, explaining the company is waiting to line up its financing before making a formal approach.... More here: AB InBev Seeking Finance for SABMiller Deal As covered earlier, SAB is \u2018in play\u2019 after Heineken rejected a takeover bid from the UK brewer last night. Speaking of the eurozone, Fathom Consulting have predicted that the European Central Bank will launch a full-blown quantitative easing stimulus scheme by the end of this year. One factor is the falling oil price (it hit a 27-month low this morning), which will push inflation lower. Fathom write: Earlier this month the ECB pulled out a small bazooka, announcing a 10 basis point cut in all three policy rates of interest, and setting out a programme of ABS and covered bond purchases. We view the latter as a staging post on the path to full-blown QE, which would involve the use of Central Bank money to buy government bonds, and Bunds in particular. Mr Draghi\u2019s announcement has affected our exchange rate forecasts, with the euro weaker through the remainder of this year than we had thought likely one month ago. But the consequences for euro area inflation are more than offset by falling energy costs. For now, oil markets appear more focused on continuing signs of a slowdown in both China and Europe than on geopolitical risks stemming from increased tensions in the Middle East. Major oil benchmarks have fallen between $5 per barrel and $10 per barrel over the past few weeks, and this has caused us to revise down our inflation forecasts across the board. We see euro area inflation hitting 0.0% by the end of the year. On our central view, this prompts the ECB to ramp up the purchase programme announced earlier this month to include purchases of sovereign debt. This brings about a meaningful depreciation of the euro, avoiding a prolonged period of deflation \u2013 for now. Here\u2019s Katie Allen on today\u2019s OECD report (highlights and charts start here): The global economy faces headwinds from a sluggish eurozone and rising political tensions, including the uncertain outcome of Scotland\u2019s independence referendum, a leading thinktank has warned. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) has slashed its growth forecasts for advanced economies and called on the European Central Bank to use quantitative easing to shore up the eurozone. Updating its economic outlook ahead of a G20 meeting of finance ministers in Australia this week, the Paris-based OECD described continued slow growth in the euro area as the \u201cmost worrying feature\u201d of its new projections. OECD deputy secretary-general Rintaro Tamaki said: \u201cThe global economy is expanding unevenly, and at only a moderate rate. Trade growth therefore remains sluggish and labour market conditions in the main advanced economies are improving only gradually, with far too many people still unable to find good jobs worldwide..... More here: OECD slashes growth forecasts for leading economies Back in the eurozone, new data shows that the region\u2019s trade surplus has swelled again, but there are signs that exports may be weakening. Eurozone exports rose by 3% year-on-year in July, Eurostat reports, while imports only increased by 1%. This pushed the trade surplus to \u20ac21.2bn, up from \u20ac18bn in July 2013. But on a seasonally adjusted basis, exports dropped by 0.2% month-on-month, while imports were up by 0.9%. That has alarmed Howard Archer, economist at IHS Global Insight: The seasonally-adjusted July trade data do little for hopes that net trade will do much to help the Eurozone return to growth in the third quarter after GDP only stagnated in the second quarter. In fact, the July data suggests that there is a risk that net trade could actually be negative in the third quarter and hold back Eurozone GDP growth. And if that wasn\u2019t enough, the OECD is also worried that that global investors are too upbeat: The bullishness of financial markets appears at odds with the intensification of several significant risks. A number of equity markets are reaching record highs, sovereign bond yields in several countries are near all-time lows and implied share price volatility in the United States and Europe is around pre-crisis levels. This highlights the possibility that risk is being mispriced and the attendant dangers of a sudden correction. The OECD has also cited the Scottish referendum as one of several key risks that could hit the global economy. Here\u2019s the list of risks highlighted in today\u2019s update from the Paris-based thinktank: The possibility that euro area inflation will stay low and exacerbate weak demand Geopolitical risks have grown with an intensification of conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East Increasing uncertainty about the outcome of the referendum on Scottish independence Many emerging economies remain vulnerable to financial market shocks given the build-up of debt, particularly corporate debt, in recent years There are \u201cupside risks\u201d too, the thinktank notes, such as the current healthcheck of Europe\u2019s banks. \u2022 The successful implementation of the comprehensive assessment of banks in the euro area could be associated with faster-than-expected improvements in credit flows. The OECD is pretty blunt about the eurozone\u2019s problems: The recovery in the euro area has remained disappointing, notably in the largest countries: Germany, France and Italy. Confidence is again weakening, and the anaemic state of demand is reflected in the decline in inflation, which is near zero in the zone as a whole and negative in several countries. While the resumption in growth in some periphery economies is encouraging, a number of these countries still face significant structural and fiscal challenges, together with a legacy of high debt. It urges the European Central Bank, which announced a new QE-style asset purchase scheme this month, to be bold: The euro area needs more vigorous monetary stimulus, whereas the United States and the United Kingdom are moving to the end of their unconventional monetary easing. And the OECD also warned that the eurozone\u2019s weak inflation rate \u201craises the risk of slipping into deflation, which could perpetuate stagnation and aggravate debt burdens.\u201d Breaking: The OECD has issued a new warning about \u201cweak demand in the euro area\u201d holding back the global recovery, and cut its growth forecasts for major economies. The organisation has cut its global growth forecasts for most major economies, slashing its eurozone prediction from 1.2% to just 0.8%. My colleague Katie Allen reports: Updating its economic outlook published in May, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) says the global economy is continuing to expand at a \u201cmoderate and uneven pace\u201d. It adds: \u201cThe tepid rate of growth means that a substantial degree of labour market slack remains, especially in the euro area, and world trade growth remains sluggish. Global growth should be somewhat more vigorous in the second half of 2014 and into 2015 given continued policy support, favourable financial conditions and growing confidence, alongside rising employment.\u201d The latest assessment also notes a \u201cgrowing degree of divergence between the major economies. \u201cThe recovery in the United States is solid, and growth is around trend in Japan and China and strengthening in India after the recent weak patch. By contrast, growth in the euro area looks set to remain subdued in the near term and Brazil is expected to make only a slow recovery from recession.\u201d The thinktank says monetary must remain supportive in all the major advanced economies \u201cwhile most countries need to make further progress on fiscal consolidation to ensure that debt burdens remain sustainable.\u201d It flags a key risk as \u201cthe possibility that euro area inflation will stay low and exacerbate weak demand\u201d. In four days time, we\u2019ll know whether Scotland has taken the historic, dramatic step of voting for independence. Amid the uncertainty over the UK\u2019s future, the pound is jittery this morning, down around a tenth of a cent at $1.625. Alasdair Cavalla of the Centre for Economics and Business Research says Scotland\u2019s referendum will dominate the markets this week: The economic consequences of a Yes vote are still unclear, with uncertainty over currency predicted, though certainly weaker prospects for certain industries. As the three main UK parties and the Bank of England have all ruled out a currency union, Scotland would have to choose between a new \u201cScottish pound\u201d, the euro, and unilateral adoption of the UK pound, where both of the latter two options would mean having no monetary independence. Scotland\u2019s financial services industry would see a very negative outcome, with large numbers of job losses. The outcome is still in the balance, with the No campaign only a couple of percentage points ahead in the latest polls. This chart shows how the gap has narrowed.... John Caudwell, the billionaire founder of Phones 4u, has blamed short-term private equity firms and \u201cruthless\u201d mobile network operators for its demise. Caudwell sold Phones 4u in 2006. It was then acquired by private equity form BC Partners in 2011. Phones 4u\u2019s fall into administration is awful news for its staff, and a blow to customers. But it\u2019s a fillip for its high street rivals. Shares in Dixons Carphone are up 2.5% this morning, on predictions that it will mop up more sales if Phones 4u\u2019s stores don\u2019t reopen. Here\u2019s our Q&amp;A on the Phones 4u collapse: Phones 4u to close - Q&amp;A Back on the collapse of Phones 4u, and the stricken retailer has said that full refunds will be paid to customers with outstanding orders. The company\u2019s website is down this morning, complete with a glum emoticon: As our story explains, Phones 4u blamed its fate on mobile network EE, which decided to stop selling through the company. It\u2019s a blow to anyone who had trusted Phones 4u to deliver the latest Apple handset: The retailer has pledged to refund customers in full for any orders that have not yet been dispatched. While there was grumbling on Twitter from customers who had ordered an iPhone 6 as recently as Friday, the company said it had ceased trading \u201cas soon as practically possible\u201d. Phones 4u goes into administration \u2013 with 5,600 jobs at risk The takeover talk in the brewing sector has also pushed Carlsberg\u2019s share up around 1.9% this morning. Is the hunter about to turn into the hunted? Shares in British brewing giant SABMiller have jumped by 5% today, after an attempt to merge with Heineken was rebuffed. Dutch firm Heineken announced last night that it had rejected an approach from SAB, the world\u2019s second-largest brewer by revenue. Analysts say that SAB was keen to merge with Heineken to protect itself against a takeover offer from Anheuser-Busch InBev, the world\u2019s biggest brewer. With the family that controls Heineken determined to \u201cpreserve the heritage and identity\u201d of the company, SAB could now be targeted by Inbev. As Matthew Beesley of Henderson Global Investors put it to Bloomberg: \u201cSAB is the leading asset that everybody wants to own,\u201d \u201cIf you are InBev looking to truly build a global brewer, which they have been doing in recent years, the next asset that ABI would want to buy is SAB.\u201d SAB\u2019s brands include Pilsner Urquell, Peroni Nastro Azzurro, Miller and Grolsch. Heineken\u2019s shares are up 1.4% today. As expected, the weak Chinese factory data has hit shares in Europe. The main indices have all fallen in early trading. FTSE 100: down 25 points at 6781, - 0.4% German DAX: down 47 points at 9603. -0.5% French CAC: down 21 points at 4420, -0.5% Spain\u2019s IBEX: down 24 points at 10864, - 0.2% Italian MIB: down 99 points at 20971, -0.5% Mike van Dulken, head of research at Accendo Markets, says markets are also being hit by geopolitical worries, as Ukrainian troops battle with pro-Russian forces. He adds that the disappointing data from China is: ...adding to last week\u2019s growth uncertainty and giving PM Li little choice but to stimulate or miss 2014\u2019s growth target even if he has distanced himself from the former of late. As this chart shows, the Brent crude price has fallen by over 15% since June when it hit $115 per barrel. It\u2019s now hitting levels not seen since the summer of 2012, when the eurozone crisis was raging. The Brent crude oil price has hit its lowest level since late June 2012. Fears that China\u2019s economy weakened in August helped to drive the cost of a barrel of Brent crude down to $96.33, a near 27-month low. Traders are calculating that Chinese firms may require less energy, if the country\u2019s industrial sector is weakening. As Ric Spooner, chief market analyst of CMC Markets in Sydney, put it (via Reuters) \u201cObviously economic growth in China is one of the key drivers of world growth and generally of oil demand. As it currently stands, it seems likely that the (oil) demand growth won\u2019t keep up with the growth in supply capacity.\u201d The oil price is also being pulled down by the strengthening US dollar; the greenback has risen as investors anticipate that the US Federal Reserve could sound hawkish on Wednesday, when it holds its monthly meeting. Kevin Lai, senior economist with Daiwa Capital Markets in Hong Kong, was also alarmed that China\u2019s industrial output slowed so sharply last month. He told Bloomberg: \u201cThis is really bad. \u201cThe economy continues to slow down despite the fact that there has been some policy easing, and the data confirm what import growth has been telling us.\u201d Australia\u2019s stock market led the fallers in Asia/Pacific overnight, down 1% following the surprise drop in Chinese factory growth: Capital Spreads trader Jonathan Sudaria says the Chinese industrial slowdown has come at a bad time: \u201cAs if traders didn\u2019t have enough to contend with this week what with the Scottish referendum and the FOMC meeting, China has flapped their hands in the air to remind everyone that they are facing an abrupt slowdown\u201d Here\u2019s the state of play: Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the financial markets, the world economy, business and finance. There\u2019s a nervous air in the markets today after China\u2019s industrial sector posted the weakest growth since the financial crisis began six years ago, according to data released over the weekend. Chinese factory production rose just 6.9% annually in August, a level not seen since March 2009, down from 9.0% in July. And with retail sales and investment figures also weaker than forecast, there are new fears that China\u2019s economy is slowing faster than official figures show. Stan Shamu of IG explains: This reading was the weakest since March 2009, with a big drop off in ferrous metal smelting. This resulted in power and heat production falling 1.7%. In the past, electricity consumption has been used as one of the most accurate indications of activity and this partial read will be a concern. Growth also slowed in retail sales and fixed asset investment. There will now be plenty of talk around China\u2019s growth target and whether it can be achieved with such mediocre activity. Most Asian markets have fallen overnight, sending the MSCI index of Asia-Pacific shares down to a five-week low. European markets are expected to follow, with traders also anxious ahead of the Federal Reserve\u2019s meeting on Wednesday. Here\u2019s the opening calls: FTSE 100: 6785, -22 points German DAX: 9592, -59 points French CAC: 4417, -25 points Spanish IBEX: 10813, -76 points Italian MIB: 20965, -106 points In the UK, thousands of staff at Phones 4U face uncertainty after the company announced last night it is going into administration. We should be hearing more from the company today. Phones 4u goes into administration \u2013 with 5,600 jobs at risk We\u2019ll have an eye on the pound, as the Scottish independence battle enters its final few days. Also on the agenda... The OECD is issuing its latest assessment of the world economy, at 10am BST, ahead of the meeting of G20 finance ministers in Australia this week. We also get eurozone trade data at 10am BST, and US industrial production data at 2.15pm. I\u2019ll be tracking all the main events through the day.",

SABMiller, which is listed on the London Stock Exchange, saw its share price rise 5.3% to \u00a335.87.",
