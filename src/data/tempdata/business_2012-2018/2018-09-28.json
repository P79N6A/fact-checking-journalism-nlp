      "bodyText": "Unilever\u2019s plan to move its headquarters to Rotterdam enjoys \u201chuge support\u201d among shareholders, chairman Marijn Dekkers declared this week, trying to sound confident that he will win next month\u2019s big vote, necessary for the relocation to go ahead. Three days later, he has another high-profile rebel on his hands. Legal &amp; General Investment Management yesterday became the latest big-name UK fund manager to say it will vote against the move. \u201cWe do not believe Unilever has made a compelling case,\u201d L&amp;G said. Defeat on 26 October would be a humiliation for the star-studded board of international directors that runs the \u00a3120bn company, which has 160,000 employees worldwide. Unilever itself is widely admired for its long-term management of famous brands such as Ben &amp; Jerry\u2019s, Domestos, Dove, Knorr, Lipton and Magnum. But the proposal to scrap an Anglo-Dutch structure that has existed since 1930, when Lever Brothers of the UK combined with the Margarine Unie of the Netherlands, has caused a storm. Whatever Dekkers says, the rebellion is significant \u2013 and growing. L&amp;G manages a 2% stake in Unilever and is the sixth-largest holder of the plc class of Unilever\u2019s shares. Fellow declared opponents include Aviva Investors and M&amp;G. Lindsell Train will be voting at least some of its shares the same way and Colombia Threadneedle has made sceptical noises. Unilever is plainly rattled. It bought full-page newspaper adverts this week to make its case, attempting to appeal to private shareholders who will also have a big say in the outcome thanks to a quirky voting model. How did it come to this? The tale starts in January last year, when US cheese-and-ketchup firm Kraft Heinz launched a daring takeover pitch. Unilever was stunned. The board had assumed their company was so big it was bulletproof, especially from aggressive cost-cutters like Kraft, an outfit branded \u201cfast and ruthless\u201d by Unilever chief executive Paul Polman. In the event, Kraft rapidly retreated but Unilever took a collective vow of \u201cnever again\u201d. The result was a corporate review that was mostly cheered. Unilever pushed its own cost-cutting programme, put its margarines and spreads business up for sale and launched a \u20ac5bn (\u00a34.5bn) share buyback. The share price boomed. But the final piece was the proposal to incorporate in the Netherlands. Dual nationality is too fussy for the modern world, the company argued. It makes capital-raisings harder and complicates dealmaking. Not every investor is convinced by the legal argument, but many are. The critical problem, however, is that Unilever\u2019s shares would be ejected from all UK stock indices, including the FTSE 100 and FTSE All-Share, if the company incorporates in Rotterdam. Index-compiler FTSE Russell, part of the London Stock Exchange Group, appears adamant that Unilever\u2019s ancient ties to the UK would not count. The country of incorporation is the decider. Unilever\u2019s shares would still be traded in London, as well as Amsterdam and New York, but index status would be lost. For the likes of L&amp;G, that is a deal-breaker. Most of the money it runs is \u201cpassively\u201d managed, meaning its funds buy every stock in the relevant index. Its managers believe clients like owning Unilever. \u201cWe asked the company to ensure that any approach they take safeguards the ability of our clients to maintain their investment and benefit form Unilever\u2019s continued success,\u201d said Sacha Sedan, L&amp;G\u2019s director of corporate governance. Exit from the FTSE indices clearly fails that test. A UK tracker fund would become a forced seller. So why doesn\u2019t Unilever just unify in the UK? Why was Rotterdam chosen in the first place? Unilever\u2019s main argument strikes many as thin. As currently structured, two companies sit beneath Unilever\u2019s main holding company \u2013 the Dutch NV unit that comprises 55% of the whole and the UK plc that is 45%. The bias makes Dutch incorporation natural, argues the company, and, besides, the NV stock is more actively traded. Rebels donot buy it. The 55/45 split is irrelevant, they say. London is Europe\u2019s biggest capital market and will remain so after Brexit. And the index point is critical, they argue. \u201cI don\u2019t see logically why any UK shareholder would support Unilever\u2019s decision to go Dutch because there is no upside but there is downside, and we lose an excellent company from the index,\u201d David Cumming of Aviva Investors has said. Some sceptics suspect deeper motives behind the choice of Rotterdam. Did Unilever judge that the Netherlands, with its stricter takeover rules, would offer greater sanctuary from future Krafts? Was Brexit a factor? Did a board with Dutch chairman and a Dutch chief executive simply prefer the Netherlands? It\u2019s purely business, says Unilever, pointing out that it would simultaneously dismantle a Dutch trust that could, in theory, have been used to frustrate bidders. Worried Brits, it argues, should remember that two out three operating divisions will still be in the UK and the jobs are not moving. It is still possible that Unilever will get the 75% majority it needs in one of two polls. For starters, international investors are unlikely to make a fuss. But the other poll is unpredictable. Unilever requires \u201ca majority in number\u201d among plc investors, meaning everybody gets one vote, whether they own 100 shares or 100,000. That gives private shareholders real clout since there are 36,000 of them versus only 8,500 institutions. Their numbers could even be swelled if individuals unlock themselves from nominee arrangements at the likes of Hargreaves Lansdown and ensure their votes are counted in both polls. In fact, anyone can still buy a share and vote. From Unilever\u2019s point, the picture must look suddenly chaotic. Its lobbying at the end of last year was concentrated on ensuring the UK government, in the midst of its Brexit woes, did not make a fuss about the rejection of London. Now it could be facing a patriotic small army of UK private investors who may take their lead from Aviva, L&amp;G and M&amp;G. And fellow sceptic Nick Train of Lindsell Train is a hero in the world of retail investors. The showdown is still more than three weeks away, which leaves time for more plot twists. But note that L&amp;G said it had taken the unusual step of declaring early \u201cdue to significant client enquiries\u201d. Put another way, the temperature around Unilever\u2019s \u201cgo Dutch\u201d plan is running far higher than the company ever expected.",

      "bodyText": "The close of Aditya Chakrabortty\u2019s Alternatives column (26 September) is an opportunity to spread alternatives for economic justice and sustainability across the mainstream of the Guardian. The business environment we trade in tends to assume that companies are investor-owned, and operating against that default incurs cost and risk. It takes confidence, even courage, to grow alternatives. Similarly, media reporting on alternatives takes effort, reaching outside of the bubble of the stock market ticker tape and corporate PR. One example, the community shares model for co-ops, with over 100,000 member investors, has been a game-changer. Community energy, village shops, community-owned pubs and new online platform co-ops are reinventing capital markets on a local, human scale. The same is true for every other part of the economy, from housing and work to trade and innovation. In each case, there are extraordinary stories of people coming together, stories of setbacks and scandals of the neglect of communities by powerful institutions. It is true that there is no one blueprint of alternative action, and sometimes our diversity of tribes and names can make it hard to join up the dots. But there are increasing partnerships across those working in the social economy of co-operatives, mutuals, employee-owned firms and social enterprise, because of a sense of urgency. We know that now is the time for a more fundamental debate. How do we change the economy towards the values of equality and sustainability? Here is a story that affects us all. Ed Mayo Co-operatives UK \u2022 Aditya Chakrabortty is right to restate Nye Bevan\u2019s key question: \u201cWhere does power lie \u2026 and how can it be attained by workers?\u201d A recent BMG Research poll for the Electoral Reform Society showed that 75% of Labour voters believe democracy in Britain is in urgent need of reform, as do two-thirds of voters in general. Labour conference spent a lot of time debating its internal democracy. But this conversation needs to be expanded to include the entire Westminster system, from a fair, proportional electoral system where every vote counts, to scrapping the archaic House of Lords and tackling the \u201cwild west\u201d in modern campaigning. We cannot truly \u201ctake back control\u201d within the confines of a crumbling democracy. Without political equality, there is simply no way to build real economic equality: the rules of the game are rigged against workers. A new Charter for Democracy would show Labour is serious about giving power to the many. This vital work should start now. Nancy Platts Politics For The Many campaign co-ordinator, and former trade union adviser to Jeremy Corbyn \u2022 Nye Bevan knew from his experiences in Tredegar the limitations of local initiatives of the kind Aditya Chakrabortty has covered in his excellent series. It was the reason he posed the question \u201cWhere was the power and which the road to it?\u201d His answer, the conquest of the commanding heights of the economy, was the challenge then and remains so for the Labour party and working people today. Michael Leigh London \u2022 \u201cWhere there\u2019s a will there\u2019s a way\u201d is certainly true here in south-west Scotland. When financial support for meals on wheels was withdrawn the Royal Voluntary Service gave it up. Our local volunteers who delivered the food were so concerned to keep the provision of meals going, however, that they persuaded a local hotel to provide the food at the same price as before and the much appreciated service and regular visits will continue. The community council will help with insurance etc. Good on you, girls! Helen Keating Gatehouse of Fleet, Kirkcudbrightshire \u2022 Although I admire and usually agree totally with Aditya Chakrabortty, I must disagree with him when he says that Brexit has brought chaos on the all-powerful.

      "bodyText": "Investors have struck a gloomy note on the final trading day of the third quarter. Markets are sharply lower across Europe, as investors do not share the Italian government\u2019s enthusiasm for a higher deficit target. The spending plans - with a 2.4% of GDP deficit target for 2019 - have raised tensions with Brussels, which has argued for debt reduction in Italy, and prompted fears of a fresh debt crisis. Italy\u2019s banking index was down 6 % and set for its biggest one-day loss since June 2016, with shares in the country\u2019s two largest banks, Intesa Sanpaolo and UniCredit, also falling by 6%. The euro has also been hit, and is currently down 0.5% against the dollar at $1.1582. It is roughly flat against the pound at 88.98p. In the UK, second-quarter economic growth was confirmed at 0.4%, but the detail showed firms cut their investments in Britain over the period. On that note, we\u2019ll close up for the day. Thank you for all the comments, and please join us again on Monday. US markets have opened lower on the last day of trading in the third quarter. Sentiment is being dragged lower by Italy\u2019s budget decisions, which have raised fears of a fresh debt crisis, and concerns over trade tensions continues to weigh. Opening scores: Dow Jones: -0.2% at 26,397 S&amp;P 500: -0.2% at 2,909 Nasdaq: -0.2% at 8,025 US consumer spending ticked up 0.3% in August, following a 0.4% rise in July. Wall Street is expected to open lower: Time for a market re-cap. Shares across Europe are sharply down after Italy defied EU wishes and set a deficit target of 2.4% of GDP, signalling higher spending and triggering fears of a potential debt crisis. Here are the current scores: Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB: -4.3% at 20,585 FTSE 100: -0.5% at 7,505 Germany\u2019s DAX: -1.8% at 12,214 France\u2019s CAC: -1.3% at 5,468 Spain\u2019s IBEX: -1.8% at 9,356 Europe\u2019s STOXX 600: -1% at 383 Richard Flax at Moneyfarm says Italian bondholders could face further price falls when the European Central Bank winds down its bond-buying programme by the end of the year: Italian bondholders\u2019 hopes were raised by signs of greater pragmatism from the coalition government, once they were in office. However, tensions in the government seemed to have spilled over with an agreement to run a budget deficit of 2.4% for the next three years and committing to greater government spending. As we begin to see signs of fiscal slippage, and a larger deficit, bond markets will continue to react negatively, perhaps even raising concerns about Italy\u2019s long-term debt sustainability. This could be compounded when you consider that the ECB\u2019s role in Eurozone bond markets is likely to reduce as the end of the year approaches. Luigi Di Maio, Italy\u2019s deputy prime minister, says he is proud of the work the government is doing. He tweets: With the #ManovraDelPopolo we are keeping the promises made! Yesterday they said it was impossible. Today they say it was not to be done. Tomorrow they will remain silent. Proud of the work we are doing for the Italian \ud83d\udcaa\ud83c\uddee\ud83c\uddf9\ud83d\ude00 people The euro\u2019s losses are widening as investors become increasingly fretful about Italy\u2019s rising debts and the impact the country\u2019s banking system. The single currency is down 0.6% against the dollar, at $1.1572. It is also down -0.2% against the pound, at 88.79p Professor Costas Milas at Liverpool University\u2019s Management School says the issues facing Italian banks have the potential to spread to other countries: The Italian \u2018virus\u2019 has the potential to spread rapidly in other EU countries and in particular to France and Portugal because of bank exposure to Italian debt. Bank of International Settlements (BIS) data suggests that French banks have quite a high exposure to Italian public and private debt, accounting for as much as 10.25% of their exposure around the world, followed by Portuguese banks with a 7.81% exposure to Italian debt. Spanish banks have a much lower exposure of 4.65%, while British and Irish banks are \u2018fairly\u2019 immune: Irish banks have a much lower exposure of 1.28% and British banks an even lower exposure of 0.82% to Italian debt. Angela Giuffrida reports from Rome: Luigi Di Maio, Italy\u2019s deputy prime minister and leader of the anti-establishment Five Star Movement, is feeling particularly victorious as the budget included the \u20ac10bn required to bring about the party\u2019s key election campaign promise of a universal basic income. Di Maio says it will finally lift 6.5 million people, long ignored by previous administrations, out of poverty. But it is yet to be made clear who will benefit from the means-tested system. It could be that the income, which starts at \u20ac780 for a single person, will only go to those who do not own a property. Some 80% of Italians own their homes. The Italian government is targeting a budget deficit of 2.4% of GDP for 2019, compared with a target of 0.8% set by the previous government. At 2.4%, the budget target is safely within the EU\u2019s general rule that a country\u2019s deficit must not exceed 3% of GDP. But Italy is a special case, because national debt stands at a whopping 131% of GDP, second only to Greece. The previous government had pledged to cut its debt, and had been aiming for a 0.8% deficit in 2019, before balancing the books and eliminating the deficit by 2020. Pierre Moscovici, the European commissioner for economic and financial affairs, gave a stark warning to Italians on Friday morning: If Italians continue to get into debt, what happens? The interest rate increases and the cost of servicing debt becomes greater. Italians must not be mistaken: every euro more of debt is one euro less for the highways, for schools, for social justice. Moscovici told France\u2019s BFM TV it was not in the interests of the EU to have a row with Italy over its budget plans: We have no interest in a crisis between the (European) Commission and Italy, nobody has an interest because Italy is an important eurozone country. But we don\u2019t have any interest either that Italy does not respect the rules and does not reduce its debt, which remains explosive. It\u2019s a sea of red across European markets this morning, with Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB leading other major indices lower: David Madden, analyst at CMC Markets, gives his take: A rise in Italian bond yields has put major pressure on the FTSE MIB, and other European markets are feeling the pain too. The coalition government has agreed to run a budget deficit of 2.4%, and the two parties in power are keen to boost public spending in a bid to stimulate the economy. Brussels will not be happy with the announcement as they would like to see the budget deficit being capped at 2%. The Italian government is sitting on a mountain of debt, and the boosting in public spending is likely to make them more indebted, which could trigger another debt crisis in the currency bloc. Back to Italy now, where the sell-off of shares and bonds continues after the government announced it would increase public spending despite a massive debt pile. The benchmark equities index, the FTSE MIB, is now down 2.7% at 20,930. Banking shares have been hardest hit, with shares in the sector down 6% and on course for the biggest one-day loss since June 2016. Annual inflation in the eurozone increased to 2.1% in September, from 2% in August, according to the latest \u2018flash estimate\u2019 from Eurostat, the region\u2019s statistics office. Energy prices were the biggest driver, rising by 9.5% this month, compared with 9.2% in August. Food, alcohol and tobacco prices were another driver, up 2.7% from 2.4% in August. Ruth Gregory, senior UK economist at Capital Economics, says the detail behind the headline growth figures is disappointing, and likely to make the Bank of England more cautious about raising interest rates. Today\u2019s second-quarter GDP figures left the economy looking a little weaker than before. [The ONS] confirmed that GDP rose by 0.4% on the first quarter, but growth in Q1 was revised down from 0.2% to 0.1%. Meanwhile, the composition of growth revealed a rather less healthy picture. Admittedly, quarterly growth in household spending revised up a notch from 0.3% to 0.4%. But net trade exerted a large drag of 0.6 points on GDP growth. And both government consumption and business investment were revised sharply lower. Looking ahead, though, there have been encouraging signs that activity has strengthened at the start of Q3, with three-month GDP growth rising from 0.4% in Q2 to 0.6% in July \u2013 a little above the Bank of England\u2019s 0.5% growth projection for Q3 as a whole. So despite today\u2019s figures, we remain cautiously upbeat about the economy\u2019s near-term prospects. But with the possibility of a \u201cno deal\u201d Brexit still hanging over the economy, we doubt that the Monetary Policy Committee will be in any hurry to hike interest rates again soon. We don\u2019t expect the Committee to move again until May 2019. The British economy grew by 0.4% in the second quarter, according to the second estimate from the Office for National Statistics - unchanged from the first estimate. Growth was driven by the services sector, which increased by 0.6%. Rob Kent-Smith, head of national accounts at the ONS, said the economy was weaker compared with historical averages: Although it has picked up a little from a slow start to the year, underlying economic growth remains persistently below the long-term average. The latest business investment data shows growth weakening for the fourth quarter in a row while households have spent more than they earned for seven consecutive quarters. Meanwhile our deficit with the rest of the world has grown, with goods imports increasing and overseas income falling. Angela Giuffrida, the Guardian\u2019s correspondent in Rome, says there is a mixed mood in Italy. Shortly before midnight on Thursday, a jubilant Luigi Di Maio, Italy\u2019s deputy prime minister and leader of the anti-establishment Five Star Movement, posted a photo of himself doing an air punch on the terrace of the prime minister\u2019s office in Rome, alongside the caption: \u201cGoodnight everyone, tomorrow we\u2019ll wake up in a new Italy!\u201d Meanwhile, politicians from the opposition Democratic Party said setting a deficit target at 2.4% of GDP was an \u201cirresponsible gesture\u201d. An Italian debt crisis is \u201can accident waiting to happen\u201d, according to economists at the Berenberg. Holger Schmieding, chief economist at the German bank, says: Since mid-2016, Italy has topped our list of home-grown risks in the Eurozone. With the fiscal plans on which the left-wing 5Stars and the right-wing Lega agreed last night, they have missed an opportunity to defuse the risk, to put it mildly. Instead, Italy is bringing itself into a precarious position. In the long run, Italy\u2019s structurally weak economy cannot afford the reversal of the 2011 pension reform and 2015 Matteo Renzi\u2019s labour market reform. Because Italy\u2019s underlying fundamentals are shaky, it may not take much to trigger a major selloff in Italian bond markets that would weaken banks, tighten financing conditions and dampen economic growth further. The increase in social spending might also lead to credit rating downgrades (Moody\u2019s and S&amp;P will update their ratings in October) increasing pressure on the sovereign bond yields. An Italian debt crisis remains an accident waiting to happen. Italy\u2019s budget plans are weighing on the euro this morning, but it could be worse. The euro is down just 0.1% against the dollar, at $1.1626, suggesting that currency traders are not overly concerned that Italy\u2019s debt issues will weigh on the wider eurozone. The Italian government\u2019s decision to target a budget deficit of 2.4% in 2019 - despite heavy debts and opposition from the EU \u2013 is weighing on bonds as well as equities this morning. The yields on two-year, five-year and 10-year Italian are all higher, where a higher yield reflects a lower price. Italy\u2019s benchmark index, the FTSE MIB, is down more than 2% in early trading at 21,038. The sharp fall reflects investor fears over the budget agreement reached by the country\u2019s government last night. Under the terms of the agreement, Italy\u2019s deficit in 2019 will be 2.4% of GDP, as leaders seek to increase public spending and deliver on election promises. However, the pledge puts the heavily indebted country on a collision course with the European Union, as well as its own economy minister, Giovanni Tria, who were pushing for a lower deficit. Michael Hewson from CMC Markets explains: A greement on the Italian budget was eventually reached on a budget for 2019 of 2.4% of GDP, a move that could see the Italians censured by Brussels who wanted the budget to come in under 2% of GDP, and finance minister Giovanni Tria who was looking for the number to come in somewhere between the two. The pound is not suffering too badly this morning despite those gloomy surveys on Brexit - and another intervention from Boris Johnson - which reflect a subdued mood among firms and consumers alike. Sterling is up 0.1% against the euro at \u20ac1.1244, and down 0.1% against the dollar at $1.3067. Jasper Lawler at London Capital Group, says: After two straight sessions of declines, the pound was also showing signs of resilience this morning. Despite UK consumer confidence dropping by more than forecast the pound lifted in early trade. GFK consumer confidence figures declined to -9, below the -7 forecast. Unsurprisingly Brexit remains the key culprit. The lack of clarity on Brexit is leaving consumer concerned over the health of the economy. Although, so far confidence towards personal finance is still healthy. Consumers are still happy to spend, and recent solid retail figures support the survey evidence. This goes some way to explaining why the pound was able to shrug off the disappointing figure. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Surveys published this morning reflect a gloomy mood among UK businesses and consumers as the Brexit deadline draws closer. With six months to go until the UK leaves the EU, nearly two thirds of UK firms have yet to prepare for a no-deal scenario according to the British Chambers of Commerce. The BCC says many companies are \u201ceither awaiting more clarity before they act or are suffering from Brexit fatigue and have switched off from the process because they don\u2019t believe they will be affected\u201d. Meanwhile consumer confidence fell two points in September, to -9, as the deadline nears, according to GfK\u2019s long running index. GfK\u2019s Joe Staton: \u201cThere are fewer than 200 days until Brexit arrangements in some shape or fashion take effect. The clock is ticking down and in September the consumer mood dropped a couple of notches. When respondents talk about their personal finances, the scores are still positive. But for the general economy, they can only reflect on the obvious uncertainty surrounding Brexit.

[The ONS] confirmed that GDP rose by 0.4% on the first quarter, but growth in Q1 was revised down from 0.2% to 0.1%. </p> <p>Meanwhile, the composition of growth revealed a rather less healthy picture. Admittedly, quarterly growth in household spending revised up a notch from 0.3% to 0.4%. But net trade exerted a large drag of 0.6 points on GDP growth. And both government consumption and business investment were revised sharply lower. </p> <p>Looking ahead, though, there have been encouraging signs that activity has strengthened at the start of Q3, with three-month GDP growth rising from 0.4% in Q2 to 0.6% in July \u2013 a little above the Bank of England\u2019s 0.5% growth projection for Q3 as a whole. </p> <p>So despite today\u2019s figures, we remain cautiously upbeat about the economy\u2019s near-term prospects. But with the possibility of a \u201cno deal\u201d Brexit still hanging over the economy, we doubt that the Monetary Policy Committee will be in any hurry to hike interest rates again soon.

      "bodyText": "UK companies cut their investments in Britain in the second quarter of 2018 amid mounting uncertainty over Brexit, marking the fourth consecutive quarter of weak spending by firms, according to government figures. The Office for National Statistics said spending on projects and assets including transport equipment, machinery, buildings and intellectual property fell by 0.7% over the three months to the end of June to \u00a347.5bn. Recent barometers of business activity suggest uncertainty around Brexit could be one of the main factors for the reduction, the ONS added. Concerns are mounting that lower levels of business investment in Britain ahead of its billed departure from the EU in March 2019 could lower the rate of economic growth, while making it harder for the UK to overcome weak levels of productivity growth seen since the financial crisis of a decade ago. Christine Lagarde, the head of the International Monetary Fund, warned earlier this month that the UK could have seen an improvement in productivity, which is key to raising workers\u2019 wages and living standards, if ministers had applied as much effort to boosting business efficiency as they had to leaving the EU. Yael Selfin, chief economist at the accountancy firm KPMG, warned: \u201cWhile we expect investment to pick up once the uncertainties around Brexit are lifted, some investment plans may not be resumed, which could have a lasting impact on the UK economy.\u201d The latest snapshot from the ONS also shows net trade activity exerted a large drag of 0.6 percentage points on GDP growth, amid falling levels of exports of British cars and machinery to international customers. Consumer spending was buoyed by the warm summer weather, increasing by 0.4% in the second quarter. However, households continued to borrow more than they saved for the seventh consecutive quarter. The latest figures complete a picture for two whole years of economic growth since the Brexit vote and show a stark slowdown. Overall growth has been 3.2% although previous estimates made before the referendum had suggested the economy could have grown much faster. John Hawksworth, chief economist at the accountancy firm PwC, said UK GDP was around 1.5% lower than might have been expected if Britain had not voted to leave the EU in the summer of 2016, equating to an annualised loss of national income in the past two years worth \u00a330bn. \u201cBrexit-related uncertainty continued to take its toll,\u201d he said.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "It\u2019s one of this season\u2019s biggest trends but it\u2019s not animal print or cycling shorts: high street fashion retailers are hiring armies of personal stylists to give shoppers the VIP treatment as they battle the slump in clothing sales. \u201cThere is still a bit of a stigma [around personal styling] from back in the day when Trinny and Susannah and Gok Wan would strip you off and make you stand in front a mirror in your bra and knickers,\u201d says Lucy Knight, one of the 140 stylists now employed to help shoppers find their best looks \u2013 and boost clothing sales \u2013 on the fashion floors of John Lewis &amp; Partners department stores. \u201cIt\u2019s not like that.\u201d Department stores have found themselves in the firing line as the growth of online shopping sucks sales out of the high street. To stay relevant John Lewis boss Paula Nickolds believes its stores need to get into the business of selling \u201cexperiences\u201d as they fight for a slice of discretionary consumer spending that increasingly competes with mini breaks and nights out. To that end its customers can now expect the kind of red carpet treatment usually found in upmarket stores such as Harrods and Selfridges. A two-hour session with Knight, who is based in the \u201cstyle studio\u201d in John Lewis\u2019s newest branch in the Westfield super mall in west London is free but other services such as an epic four-and-a half-hour treatment in the beauty salon come with a hefty price tag. \u201cYour client needs to trust you in the first 30 seconds,\u201d says Knight, who is not paid commission on sales even though well-heeled shoppers typically part with \u00a3200 to \u00a3500 on the back of her advice. \u201cIf you don\u2019t build that trust straight away it\u2019s going to become a difficult appointment.\u201d Knight\u2019s job is to help women find the \u201cperfect pair of jeans\u201d or assemble a killer work wardrobe, preferably from John Lewis\u2019s own clothing labels, which include Modern Rarity and Kin. At a time when struggling rivals are discounting heavily, selling the department store\u2019s own brands reaps higher profit margins. John Lewis is trying to push back against a trend that has seen women \u2013 who spend more than twice the amount men do on clothes \u2013 cut back on new outfits in favour of more socialising and exercise. The advice sessions offered by Knight and the five other stylists based at the store are proving lucrative. The six personal shoppers now generate 20% of the store\u2019s womenswear sales. \u201cBritish fashion shoppers are down in number, buying less per trip and getting more on discount than they were last year,\u201d says Kantar Worldpanel\u2019s consumer insight director Glen Tooke of what is a worrying shift for fashion retailers. The total amount spent on fashion and clothing in the UK over the last year was just over \u00a335bn \u2013 \u00a3512m less than two years ago. The competition from retail rivals and other things to spend money on is writ large even on John Lewis\u2019s doorstep: a couple of doors down is a vast Primark where a winter coat costs \u00a325 and this season\u2019s culottes just \u00a313. Next door is \u201cboutique\u201d cycling studio FirstLight, where a 30ft magic mirror transports sweating spinners around the world. John Lewis already offered personal styling but is upping the ante by giving over floor space to the self-contained style studios. Although not as plush as in designer stores such as Selfridges where multilingual helpers operate out of suites themed around muses such as pop icon Grace Jones, the space is comfortable and welcoming \u2013 not unlike the furniture department. Two studios have opened so far and a further three will follow.The service is also being upgraded in other stores. But it\u2019s not just women who want fashion advice. The store\u2019s male stylist, Gursh Reandi, recounted his recent success with a retired soldier, whose wardrobe was found wanting when he started online dating. \u201cHe had the classic gentry vibe that comes with Sandhurst training but we brought his look up to date,\u201d says Reandi, who previously ran his own fashion business in Essex, dressing Premier League footballers and the cast members from The Only Way Is Essex. \u201cMy mind is a database so I can just tell,\u201d Reandi explains of the mental feat that enables him to map a customer\u2019s physique to the perfect pair of jeans. \u201cHe might be wearing jeans that are too straight a fit, which makes your legs look wider and shorter. They are conscious of not wanting to look like Joey Essex in spray-ons but you can\u2019t confuse the words slim with skinny. It\u2019s a different look altogether.\u201d Desperate price cutting by the stricken House of Fraser in the run up to last month\u2019s financial rescue by Sports Direct has made life very difficult for John Lewis and Debenhams which has suffered a collapse in its share price. When the John Lewis Partnership reported its figures for the first six months of 2018, the eponymous department store chain was the red. But despite the red ink, sales on John Lewis\u2019s fashion floors were up 1.2%, with womenswear ahead 4.1%. Debenhams boss Sergio Bucher is following suit. This week he unveiled a new look store in Watford, offering personal styling, beauty makeovers and bars selling prosecco and gin and tonic, alongside its clothing ranges. The idea, he said, was to make shopping \u201ca fun, leisure activity\u201d. My very own personal stylist experience The hot pink coat hanging on the clothes rail immediately set off alarm bells and threatened to confirm my instinct that seeking fashion advice in a mid-market department store could only end badly. I write about shopping and shops everyday, and used to love fashion, but since becoming a mum have bought most of my clothes online. The prospect of being sized up by a stranger, even if they wanted to help, did not appeal. But it turns out having a personal fashion slave at your disposal for a couple of hours is actually quite nice. At no point did anyone say \u201cbangers\u201d or aggressively hoik my bra straps and the stylist, LucyKnight, listened closely when I told her the brands I liked before scurrying off to gather outfits. Like Pat Butcher, who stuck by her 80s makeup look, it\u2019s easy to get stuck in a fashion rut. But Lucy patiently explained not all clothes have \u201changer appeal\u201d as I sniffed at a blue Hobbs dress emblazoned with red flowers. I had tasked her with finding me a new winter coat and initially struck a bum note with a camel-coloured \u201ccoatigan\u201d that made me look like a matryoshka doll. But under her guidance I was forced to reappraise the tailoring of high street brands such as Reiss (not just bandage dresses aimed at Kate Middleton types) and Ted Baker, which I\u2019d written off when I turned 40. A slate-coloured Reiss pea coat fitted my shoulders neatly and, crucially, the straight cut did not make my bum look bigger. The more sensible khaki version could easily do for winter commuting on public transport. The biggest revelation though, was when she popped out to get a pair of jeans to try on with the coat. Here we go, I thought, and sighed out loud. But to my amazement she came back with a pair of black Levis that fitted perfectly, sparing me what must be one of the most soul destroying shopping missions. I never did try on the pink coat though.",

      "bodyText": "When Goldman Sachs and billionaire Paul Tudor Jones announced a partnership three months ago to help socially conscious investors support \u201cjust business behavior\u201d, they promised that their new index fund would generate solid returns for savers while directing their investment dollars towards truly humane companies. \u201cCapitalism should be a positive force for change,\u201d said Jones in a press release announcing the fund, which is designed to track an index of socially responsible companies identified by his non-profit Just Capital. \u201cIts future will be driven by a new definition of corporate success that is aligned with the values and priorities of the public.\u201d The partnership comes as pension funds, university endowments and other institutional investors increasingly seek to put their financial weight behind ethical and sustainable corporate behavior. So far, the rebrand seems to be working: the Just fund debuted in June to rave reviews from the financial press and ended its first day of trading with over $250m in assets, making its launch one of the most successful in recent history. However, a Capital &amp; Main review of corporate documents shows that some of Just\u2019s largest investments are in fossil fuel firms that have been sued for suppressing global climate research, Wall Street behemoths fined for defrauding investors, a social media platform accused of helping rig elections and a tech industry giant criticized for paying its workers starvation wages. Moreover, proxy voting records reveal that even as Goldman Sachs now markets itself as a champion of social responsibility, the firm has been using its existing stakes in many Just fund companies to help CEOs block key environmental and social justice reforms proposed by their shareholders. Those initiatives range from gender pay gap and diversity initiatives to corporate governance reforms; from efforts to increase lobbying transparency to prohibitions on doing business with companies tied to genocide and other human rights violations. Meanwhile, in the months before Just fund\u2019s launch, Goldman was slammed for blocking a human rights resolution at its own company \u2013 and one of Goldman\u2019s key lobbying groups in Washington was working to shape Republican legislation that would make it far more difficult for shareholders to file environmental, human rights and other socially minded initiatives in the future. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t be able to, with a straight face, invest in the Dakota Access Pipeline with your left hand, and with your right hand tell people that you\u2019re doing responsible investing,\u201d Lisa Lindsley, capital markets adviser for the shareholder advocacy group SumOfUs, told Capital &amp; Main. \u201cThe compartmentalization is very hypocritical.\u201d Through a spokesperson, Goldman Sachs declined to comment on the process by which its equity funds vote on shareholder proposals, and how that process may differ with the Just fund \u2013 which, as a newly launched fund, has not yet participated in proxy voting for any of the companies in which it holds stock. \u2018Ethically motivated versus a more greenwashing approach\u2019 Goldman\u2019s new fund spotlights socially responsible investing (SRI) \u2013 a financial strategy that represents Wall Street\u2019s more affirmative answer to negative or exclusionary \u201cscreening\u201d tactics like divestment from fossil fuel producers and tobacco firms. While a recent directive by the Trump administration has been viewed by some experts as an effort to limit SRI strategies, the market for such investments remains strong. According to the Forum for Sustainable and Responsible Investment, US-based assets managed using SRI strategies more than doubled to $8.7tn between 2012 and 2016, and now account for more than one in five dollars under professional management in the country. The rise in SRI investment comes amid questions about whether corporate boards are adequately evaluating environmental and social justice concerns when they look at their company\u2019s long-term financial prospects. PwC\u2019s 2017 survey of corporate officials found \u201cthat directors are clearly out of step with investor priorities in some critical areas\u201d and the report added that \u201cone of these areas is environmental issues\u201d. High-profile initiatives like the Just fund are a chance for the industry to tout its eagerness, as the Goldman Sachs executive Timothy O\u2019Neill put it in a press release, to \u201c[allow] investment to flow toward a more sustainable and equitable future, while seeking to generate attractive returns for investors\u201d. The trend has given Wall Street an opportunity for an image makeover in a time of growing public distrust in the financial system: According to a Gallup poll conducted last month, fewer than half of Americans under 30 report having a positive view of capitalism, a 12-point drop in just the past two years. For some activists and investors, though, the rapid expansion of the market for SRI-branded financial products has raised concerns about greenwashing \u2013 the practice by which companies market themselves as socially or environmentally responsible without actually adopting business practices that meet those goals. \u201cPutting the word \u2018ethical\u2019 or \u2018sustainable\u2019 in the name of a fund does not make it so,\u201d said a report by British investment advisory firm Castlefield, whose recent reports documented how some environmental funds include investments in fossil fuel firms. \u201cIt is increasingly important to differentiate between those funds genuinely responding to customer demand for a sustainable approach and those which use terms like ethical, Socially Responsible Investment or stewardship in their name but include companies such as British American Tobacco or Shell in their key holdings.\u201d Goldman\u2019s record on socially responsible investing Amid surging interest in SRI funds, Goldman\u2019s Just US Large Cap Equity ETF aims to convince investors that the company is serious about injecting a spirit of ethics and morality into its financial strategies. To that end, the fund says it directs money only into companies that are ranked highly by Just Capital. The 426 companies featured in the Just index were selected on the basis of their performance across seven different criteria, including labor practices, customer service and environmental impacts. Goldman itself ranks in the top tenth of the Just rankings, despite the company being attacked for supporting the fossil fuel industry and also being fined $5bn in 2016 by the Department of Justice for \u201cserious misconduct in falsely assuring investors that securities it sold were backed by sound mortgages, when it knew that they were full of mortgages that were likely to fail\u201d. Whether Goldman\u2019s new Just fund represents a step in a larger shift towards socially responsible investment remains to be seen. Baruch College\u2019s Jared Peifer says that one way to judge a firm\u2019s commitment to social responsibility is to watch how it deals with resolutions brought by shareholders, whereby investors attempt to force management to adopt socially responsible policies. \u201cThere is variance to the degree that SRI funds are ethically motivated versus a more greenwashing approach,\u201d Peifer said. \u201cIs the fund dialoguing with management? Issuing shareholder proxy votes, voting on others? If so, that seems like a more ethically motivated fund to me, because they are exerting additional effort many other funds do not bother with.\u201d In recent years, Goldman executives have been fighting off SRI resolutions at their own company, including initiatives that have asked management to more transparently disclose their political lobbying and create a human rights committee to review the company\u2019s policies regarding doing business with governments engaged in censorship and repression. Only three months before Goldman announced the Just fund, Goldman successfully pressed the Securities and Exchange Commission to bless its move to block shareholders from voting on a resolution asking the company to honor indigenous peoples\u2019 rights. \u201cThe company\u2019s extraordinary no action request shows the notable lengths that the company is willing to go, and to stretch credulity, in order to prevent its directors from shouldering fiduciary obligations on indigenous and human rights,\u201d wrote shareholder proponents at the time. Last year, Goldman was lauded by Share Action, an SRI activist group, for switching its position and using its holdings to support a series of climate-change-related shareholder initiatives. In its proxy voting guidelines, Goldman says it will generally vote for proposals asking companies to report on \u201cpolicies, initiatives and oversight mechanisms related to environmental sustainability, or how the company may be impacted by climate change\u201d. However, those guidelines do not make the same commitment when it comes to initiatives requiring companies to actually reduce their carbon emissions. The guidelines also say the company will generally vote against \u201cproposals requesting increased disclosure of a company\u2019s policies with respect to political contributions\u201d. The company further says it will vote to remove representatives of employees or organized labor from a company\u2019s board if they are overseeing company audits or executive compensation, and if there is no legal requirement for them to be in that position. Goldman votes against resolutions at Just fund companies Goldman\u2019s hostility toward many SRI initiatives is illustrated by its votes on resolutions at the companies now in its Just fund. For example, there is Chevron Corporation, which ranks as the Just fund\u2019s 17th-largest holding as it faces accusations that it is trying to intimidate environmentalists and avoid cleaning up pollution in the Amazon rainforest. In May, the oil giant\u2019s shareholders were asked to vote on a slate of seven proposals, including a requirement for the company\u2019s board to nominate a director with environmental experience; the preparation of a report on transitioning to a low-carbon business model; increased transparency relating to lobbying activities; and stronger prohibitions on Chevron\u2019s interests overseas from doing business with governments that are complicit in genocide or crimes against humanity. As shareholders in Chevron, 14 different Goldman Sachs Asset Management (GSAM) funds voted on these proposals. The majority of funds voted in support of just one, a request for the company to prepare a report on its efforts to minimize methane emissions. In every other case, the funds unanimously or overwhelmingly opposed the proposals. Proxy-voting records from dozens of shareholder meetings reviewed by Capital &amp; Main show a similar pattern. In rare cases, Goldman funds did vote in favor of some shareholder reforms, including the preparation of a report on the gender pay gap at Facebook and Google. At several pharmaceutical companies, including AbbVie, Amgen and Eli Lilly, Goldman funds supported increased accountability for executives regarding high drug prices. Such votes, however, were few and far between. Of the 10 companies that make up the largest share of Goldman\u2019s Just fund, eight considered shareholder-proposed reforms that were overwhelmingly opposed by Goldman-managed funds at their most recent annual meetings. The proposals included prohibitions on offshore tax avoidance schemes, increased transparency on lobbying activities and requirements that companies appoint an independent board chair \u2013 a governance model that advocates say leads to more responsible corporate behavior. The remaining two companies, Microsoft and Visa, did not consider any shareholder proposals. At JPMorgan, the recipient of Just\u2019s fourth-largest investment, Goldman funds voted unanimously against a requirement for the company to release a report on its investments in PetroChina, a firm that activists accuse of helping to fund crimes against humanity due to its ongoing business relationships with oppressive regimes in Syria and Sudan. Goldman made that move despite its own proxy voting guidelines saying the company would \u201cgenerally vote for proposals requesting a report on company or company supplier labor and/or human rights standards and policies, or on the impact of its operations on society\u201d. Eighteen of the 19 Goldman funds with shares in JPMorgan also voted against an effort to prohibit the accelerated vesting of awards for executives who enter government service, a practice often criticized for fueling the revolving door between Wall Street and financial regulators. A shareholder proposal to the board of pharmaceutical manufacturer Johnson &amp; Johnson, expressing concern that the company\u2019s compensation practices \u201cmay insulate senior executives from legal risks\u201d relating to the opioids crisis, recommended that opioid-related litigation costs be factored into executive pay. All 16 Goldman funds with stock in Johnson &amp; Johnson voted to defeat the proposal. Goldman asserts that its fund is designed to invest in firms that rank well in Just Capital\u2019s ratings. But even that assertion is not what it seems. Because the index features companies ranked in the top half of their respective industries, it includes dozens of firms in sectors like energy and financial services that score poorly overall. For example, the fund invests in both National Oilwell Varco, a drilling equipment firm, and Entergy, a Louisiana utility, despite the fact that the companies rank 626th and 676th, respectively, among the 875 companies evaluated by Just Capital. \u201cEvery industry is represented at approximately the same weight as [in] the Russell 1000,\u201d said Just Capital\u2019s Hernando Cortina, referring to the best-known index fund tracking the largest publicly traded companies. Cortina added that the Just fund is designed to feature responsible companies \u201cwhile providing diversified equity exposure to every industry\u201d. Lisa Lindsley of SumOfUs said the situation spotlights how socially responsible investing is seen on Wall Street not as a values-based cause, but as yet another way to trick investors into believing that the investment industry has reformed itself a decade after the financial crisis. \u201cThe reason they\u2019re going into this is that there\u2019s money there. It\u2019s all driven by greed,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty easy to do some greenwashing and call yourself a responsible investment manager.\u201d As Goldman now markets its Just fund, it remains unclear whether the company will change its proxy voting or its posture towards shareholder resolutions in general. Those resolutions, though, could be more rare, if congressional Republicans pass their legislation that would make it more difficult for shareholder resolutions to qualify for a vote. Federal records show that the American Bankers Association \u2013 which lists Goldman Sachs as a member \u2013 has been lobbying on that bill, which critics say could undermine the SRI movement. \u201cShareholder proposals play an important role in ensuring that owners get a say in how their companies are run, and in setting the broader agenda across the market,\u201d wrote Dimitri Zagoroff of the shareholder advisory firm Glass Lewis. \u201cMaking it harder for shareholder proposals to be resubmitted from year to year would make it that much harder for proponents to refine their ideas and build a coalition of support. This often takes several years, both to generate interest in the underlying topic, and to convince other shareholders that the specific proposal offers the appropriate means of addressing the topic.\u201d Co-published by Capital &amp; Main, a non-profit investigative news site based in Los Angeles.",

The company further says it will vote to remove representatives of employees or organized labor from a company\u2019s board if they are overseeing company audits or executive compensation, and if there is no legal requirement for them to be in that position.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"eb8e34e46eb40f84b582a75761928e2ba31e4b44\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/eb8e34e46eb40f84b582a75761928e2ba31e4b44/0_0_1359_1600/849.jpg\" alt=\"JUST Table\" width=\"849\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">JUST Table</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Handout</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>Goldman </strong><strong>votes </strong><strong>against </strong><strong>resolutions at Just</strong><strong> </strong><strong>fund </strong><strong>companies</strong></h2> <p>Goldman\u2019s hostility toward many SRI initiatives is illustrated by its votes on resolutions at the companies now in its Just fund.</p> <p>For example, there is Chevron Corporation, which ranks as the Just fund\u2019s 17th-largest holding as it <a href=\"http://www.csrwire.com/press_releases/41323-In-SLAPP-Attack-Chevron-Trying-to-Intimidate-Citizens-Who-Challenged-Company-Over-Massive-Pollution-In-Amazon\">faces</a> <a href=\"https://www.greenpeace.org/international/story/16448/chevrons-slapp-suit-against-ecuadorians-corporate-intimidation/\">accusations</a> that it is trying to intimidate environmentalists and avoid cleaning up pollution in the Amazon rainforest.</p> <p>In May, the oil giant\u2019s shareholders were asked to vote on a slate of <a href=\"https://www.chevron.com/-/media/shared-media/documents/chevron-proxy-statement-2018.pdf\">seven proposals</a>, including a requirement for the company\u2019s board to nominate a director with environmental experience; the preparation of a report on transitioning to a low-carbon business model; increased transparency relating to lobbying activities; and stronger prohibitions on Chevron\u2019s interests overseas from doing business with governments that are complicit in genocide or crimes against humanity.</p> <p>As shareholders in Chevron, 14 different Goldman Sachs Asset Management (GSAM) funds voted on these proposals. The majority of funds voted in support of just one, a request for the company to prepare a report on its efforts to minimize methane emissions. In every other case, the funds unanimously or overwhelmingly opposed the proposals.</p> <p>Proxy-voting records from dozens of shareholder meetings reviewed by Capital &amp; Main show a similar pattern. In rare cases, Goldman funds did vote in favor of some shareholder reforms, including the preparation of a report on the gender pay gap at Facebook and Google. At several pharmaceutical companies, including AbbVie, Amgen and Eli Lilly, Goldman funds supported increased accountability for executives regarding high drug prices.</p> <p>Such votes, however, were few and far between. Of the 10 companies that make up the largest share of Goldman\u2019s Just fund, eight considered shareholder-proposed reforms that were overwhelmingly opposed by Goldman-managed funds at their most recent annual meetings. The proposals included prohibitions on offshore tax avoidance schemes, increased transparency on lobbying activities and requirements that companies appoint an independent board chair \u2013 a governance model that advocates say leads to more responsible corporate behavior. The remaining two companies, Microsoft and Visa, did not consider any shareholder proposals.</p> <p>At JPMorgan, the recipient of Just\u2019s fourth-largest investment, Goldman funds voted unanimously against a requirement for the company to release a report on its investments in PetroChina, a firm that <a href=\"https://www.investorsagainstgenocide.org/\">activists accuse</a> of helping to fund crimes against humanity due to its ongoing business relationships with oppressive regimes in Syria and Sudan. Goldman made that move despite its own <a href=\"https://www.gsam.com/content/dam/gsam/pdfs/us/en/miscellaneous/voting_proxy_policy.pdf?sa=n&amp;rd=n\">proxy voting guidelines</a> saying the company would \u201cgenerally vote for proposals requesting a report on company or company supplier labor and/or human rights standards and policies, or on the impact of its operations on society\u201d.</p> <p>Eighteen of the 19 Goldman funds with shares in JPMorgan also voted against an effort to prohibit the accelerated vesting of awards for executives who enter government service, a practice often <a href=\"https://newrepublic.com/article/120967/wall-street-pays-bankers-work-government-and-wants-it-secret\">criticized</a> for fueling the revolving door between Wall Street and financial regulators.</p> <p>A <a href=\"http://www.investor.jnj.com/_document/2018-proxy-statement?id=00000162-2469-d298-ad7a-657f7bcf0000\">shareholder proposal</a> to the board of pharmaceutical manufacturer Johnson &amp; Johnson, expressing concern that the company\u2019s compensation practices \u201cmay insulate senior executives from legal risks\u201d relating to the opioids crisis, recommended that opioid-related litigation costs be factored into executive pay. All 16 Goldman funds with stock in Johnson &amp; Johnson voted to defeat the proposal.</p> <p>Goldman asserts that its fund is designed to invest in firms that rank well in Just Capital\u2019s ratings. But even that assertion is not what it seems.</p> <p>Because the index features companies ranked in the top half of their respective industries, it includes dozens of firms in sectors like energy and financial services that score poorly overall. For example, the fund invests in both National Oilwell Varco, a drilling equipment firm, and Entergy, a Louisiana utility, despite the fact that the companies rank 626th and 676th, respectively, among the 875 companies evaluated by Just Capital.</p> <p>\u201cEvery industry is represented at approximately the same weight as [in] the Russell 1000,\u201d said Just Capital\u2019s Hernando Cortina, referring to the best-known index fund tracking the largest publicly traded companies. Cortina added that the Just fund is designed to feature responsible companies \u201cwhile providing diversified equity exposure to every industry\u201d.</p> <p>Lisa Lindsley of SumOfUs said the situation spotlights how socially responsible investing is seen on Wall Street not as a values-based cause, but as yet another way to trick investors into believing that the investment industry has reformed itself a decade after the financial crisis.</p> <p>\u201cThe reason they\u2019re going into this is that there\u2019s money there. It\u2019s all driven by greed,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty easy to do some greenwashing and call yourself a responsible investment manager.\u201d</p> <p>As Goldman now markets its Just fund, it remains unclear whether the company will change its proxy voting or its posture towards shareholder resolutions in general. Those resolutions, though, could be more rare, if congressional Republicans pass their legislation that would make it more difficult for shareholder resolutions to qualify for a vote. Federal <a href=\"https://soprweb.senate.gov/index.cfm?event=getFilingDetails&amp;filingID=529E9269-FC6B-4457-B821-E9A91D030A34&amp;filingTypeID=60\">records</a> show that the American Bankers Association \u2013 which <a href=\"https://www.aba.com/supplierdirectory/SupplierDetail.aspx?id=462466\">lists</a> Goldman Sachs as a member \u2013 has been lobbying on that bill, which critics say could undermine the SRI movement.</p> <p>\u201cShareholder proposals play an important role in ensuring that owners get a say in how their companies are run, and in setting the broader agenda across the market,\u201d <a href=\"http://www.glasslewis.com/legislative-update-hr-5756-threatens-shareholder-proposal-resubmission-thresholds/\">wrote</a> Dimitri Zagoroff of the shareholder advisory firm Glass Lewis. \u201cMaking it harder for shareholder proposals to be resubmitted from year to year would make it that much harder for proponents to refine their ideas and build a coalition of support. This often takes several years, both to generate interest in the underlying topic, and to convince other shareholders that the specific proposal offers the appropriate means of addressing the topic.\u201d</p> <p><em>Co-published by <a href=\"https://capitalandmain.com/\">Capital &amp; Main</a>, a non-profit investigative news site based in Los Angeles.</em></p>",
