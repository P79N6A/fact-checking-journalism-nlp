    "webTitle": "UK GDP growth better than expected in Brexit vote aftermath", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Britain\u2019s economy grew faster than previously thought in the three months after the EU referendum, underlining the miscalculations by the Treasury and other forecasters who predicted that the UK would suffer a recession following a vote for Brexit. Official figures showed GDP growth in the third quarter rose by 0.6%, compared with initial estimates of 0.5%. The unexpected upgrade to GDP came as the Office for National Statistics made surprise revisions across all sectors of the economy. The services, industrial and construction sectors were all revised upwards. The services sector \u2013 which accounts for about 80% of economic activity \u2013 was the main driver of growth, led by transport and communications \u2013 including online retail deliveries \u2013 which expanded by 2.6%. The finance sector grew by 0.8% quarter on quarter. But the first two quarters of the year were revised down by one percentage point each. This left the annual growth rate at 2.2%, which was lower than the earlier estimate of 2.3%. Analysts warned that the revised figures emphasised the UK\u2019s lopsided recovery, with higher growth in the City and consumer spending while the manufacturing sector continued to decline, falling by 0.8% in the third quarter, and a sharp decline in net trade. Darren Morgan of the ONS agreed that most of the revisions stemmed from an improvement in consumer spending and better figures from the financial services sector. \u201cRobust consumer demand continued to help the UK economy grow steadily in the third quarter of 2016. Growth was slightly stronger than first thought, though, due to greater output in the financial sector,\u201d he said. In May, the then chancellor, George Osborne, claimed that Treasury forecasts showed that if voters backed an exit from the EU, the country could suffer a slowdown and technical recession, which is defined as two quarters of negative growth. \u201cDoes Britain really want this DIY recession? Because that\u2019s what the evidence shows we\u2019ll get if we vote to leave the EU,\u201d he said. The International Monetary Fund and Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development sounded similar warnings before the referendum. Chris Williamson, chief business economist at financial data business IHS Markit, said it was clear that the economy remained robust despite the vote to leave. \u201cBut to say that the economy has been unscathed by the Brexit vote would be too complacent,\u201d he said. \u201cThe GDP data show that the construction sector has fallen into a technical recession, with output down 1.1% in the third quarter after a 0.1% decline in the three months to June. Industrial production and manufacturing fell 0.5% and 0.9% respectively in the third quarter. The upturn was therefore driven by services, where output rose 0.8%,. \u201cFor the moment, the data suggest that the economy has exhibited greater than anticipated resilience in the face of headwinds such as Brexit worries and rising prices. However, it seems likely that growth will slow further in coming months as these headwinds intensify.\u201d The ONS said wages jumped by 4.5% to their highest growth rate since 2013. But rising inflation and the impact of cuts to benefits meant disposable incomes shrank by more than the ONS said in its first estimate of third quarter GDP last month. Household disposable income, adjusted for inflation, decreased by 0.6%, which confirmed a dramatic turnaround from the increase of 3.6% in the same quarter last year. Paul Hollingsworth, UK economist at consultancy Capital Economics, said: \u201cAs a result of the fall in disposable income, households were only able to fund the rise in spending by reducing the proportion of their income that they save. The household saving ratio fell from 6.3% in the second quarter to 6.1% in the third, its lowest since 2008,.\u201d Net trade, or the balance between exports and imports, also slumped to -1.2% from +0.3% to register the biggest drag from the export sector on GDP since the second quarter of 2012. A spokesperson for the Treasury said: \u201cThe fundamentals of the UK economy are strong, but there remain challenges ahead. The chancellor set out, in the autumn statement, his plan to support a resilient economy that works for everyone by driving productivity and supporting working people, while maintaining fiscal discipline.\u201d",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "International Airlines Group, the owner of British Airways, is to launch low-cost transatlantic flights in a bid to grab a slice of the nascent market for no-frills long-haul air travel. The group said it would start flying from Barcelona\u2019s El Prat airport to the US in June, either under the banner of a new airline, as part of \u201clegacy\u201d carriers BA and Iberia, or via its lowest-cost long-haul airline Aer Lingus. As well as US destinations such as Los Angeles and San Francisco, it is considering cheaper routes to Buenos Aires, Santiago, Havana and Tokyo. \u201cThis new operation will add another dimension to IAG and complement the other airlines in the group,\u201d the company said in a statement. Using Barcelona\u2019s El Prat airport will allow IAG to feed passengers from its European short-haul budget carrier Vueling into the new routes, which will be flown by a pair of 300-seat Airbus A330 planes at first. IAG, created via the \u00a35bn merger of BA and Iberia in 2010, has not ruled out following suit in the UK by launching a lower-cost alternative to its transatlantic British Airways fares. Aviation analysts billed the move as a response to the growth in budget long haul flights offered by fast-expanding rivals such as Norwegian, which is taking on established players on longer journeys by undercutting them on price. \u201cThere\u2019s recognition among management at IAG that legacy airlines responded late to the development of low-cost short haul,\u201d said John Strickland, director of consultancy JLS Consulting. \u201cIAG have learned that lesson and won\u2019t let that happen again by allowing low-cost long haul development without them. Norwegian have shown it can work and they\u2019ve seen it\u2019s going to take hold.\u201d Analysts at the CAPA Centre for Aviation, an airline analysis firm, said it looked like IAG was reacting to the growth of Norwegian, which already competes with BA on US routes out of Gatwick. \u201cPlans by the low-cost carrier Norwegian to launch long-haul routes from Barcelona in 2017 may have had a catalytic effect on IAG\u2019s thinking,\u201d they said. Long-established airlines such as British Airways, American Airlines and Delta are finding their formerly lucrative transatlantic routes tougher amid rising competition from budget newcomers including Norwegian, WestJet and Wow Air. That has prompted the established or legacy carriers to develop their own low-cost exposure. Earlier this year, Lufthansa\u2019s Eurowings unit started flying long-haul to Cuba, Thailand and the Dominican Republic from Cologne and said this week it would also consider flying from Munich. Air France said in November that was considering a budget offer to the US but has yet to decided on what it might look like. Ryanair, Europe\u2019s largest short-haul carrier and the no-frills specialist, has repeatedly toyed with the idea of moving into long-haul travel but has yet to take the plunge. But IAG\u2019s entry into the market could speed up the race to win price-conscious travellers to the US, Caribbean and Latin America. \u201cThe market is big and it\u2019s price sensitive so it could be stimulated by an airline of this kind offering a lower fare proposition,\u201d said Strickland, adding that IAG\u2019s cost-cutting efforts would stand it in good stead to make money from a budget long-haul offering.",

But fans have expressed horror at the discovery that company has changed the wrappers from sweetie-style twist-wraps to uniform \u201cflow wraps\u201d that have to be torn, rather than twisted, open. Some consumers went as far as accusing Cadbury of, in keeping with the theme of 2016, ruining \u2013 well, pretty much everything. Mike Barker tweeted: Cadbury has come under fire for making the chocolates a similar shape. Controversially, the hazel in caramel, the discerning chocolate-lover\u2019s favourite, is no longer elongated, but a simple square. Frustrating for the Roses fan, perhaps, but tragic for others. Ray Foley tweeted: TJ Williams agreed: Cadbury is owned by the US company Mondel\u0113z, after the confectionery business of Kraft was split off into a separate company in 2012. The company has already faced the wrath of traditionalists after rounding the corners on Dairy Milk bars, substituting a cheaper chocolate for Dairy Milk in its Creme Eggs and stopping production of its chocolate coins. It changed the wrapping of Roses in April, but it is only as the festive period descends upon us that people have started to complain with gusto. Paul Osbourne tweeted: While some moaned that the new wrappers made distinguishing between chocolates more difficult, others didn\u2019t like the shape of them. Peter Ganley tweeted: At least the new wrappers can\u2019t be screwed up and put back in the box, which, according to some fans, is the ultimate sin: At the time of the relaunch, Cadbury\u2019s Tony Bilsborough said the company had changed the wrappers because \u201cthe quality of twist wrap was just not up to scratch\u201d. He added: \u201cTime and again we were getting complaints that the twist wrap was becoming undone, or the entire wrapper itself was appearing empty in the box.\u201d It was the No 1 complaint, he said. In a statement, the company said: \u201cAs a result of a multimillion pound investment in manufacturing, consumers will see a much-improved level of quality. We appreciate there\u2019s some nostalgia for the twist wrap but quality must come first and we know consumers will appreciate the steps we\u2019ve taken to protect each favourite and keep them fresh.\u201d Twitter user @SingleMumDiary said to the company: In 2011 a tub of Roses went from 975g to 850g, in 2015 it moved down to 777g and when the new tub was released it went to 748g. Asked if the chocolates were smaller following the redesign, a spokesman said: \u201cWhile the weight of the individual units have adapted to accommodate the new shape and wrapper, there is no change to the overall weight in both tubs and cartons of Cadbury Roses. The changes relate solely to the shape and design.\u201d But for Conor Daly, the change to the Christmas treat was the last kick in the teeth from a year on the way out:",

So it is tempting to think the bank, when asked by US Department of Justice to pay a large bill for polluting the financial system with mortgage junk between 2005 and 2007, should cough up, apologise and learn some humility. That is not the view of the chief executive, Jes Staley. Barclays thinks the DoJ\u2019s claims are \u201cdisconnected from the facts\u201d and that it has \u201can obligation to our shareholders, customers, clients and employees to defend ourselves against unreasonable allegations and demands.\u201d The stance is possibly foolhardy, since going into open legal battle with the most powerful US prosecutor is risky, especially if you end up losing. But actually, some grudging respect for Staley and Barclays is in order. The US system for dishing out fines to errant banks for their mortgage sins has come to resemble a casino. The approach prefers settlements behind closed doors and the difference in size of penalties is never explained. Occasional leaks of the negotiating demands make the methodology appear even more arbitrary. Deutsche Bank was initially asked for $14bn (\u00a311.5bn), but reached a settlement of $7.2bn on Thursday. Where is the rhyme or reason? There is also a strong suspicion that the roulette wheel is weighted against the Europeans. US banks, in the forms of JP Morgan, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, Bank of America and Citi, were at the front of the queue for settlement for no obvious reason. If Barclays created and distributed far fewer toxic mortgage securities than its US rivals, which is what the bank argues, why shouldn\u2019t its fine be proportionately smaller? Neither Barclays nor the DoJ is talking hard numbers. But Barclays, it is said, was asked for $4bn, versus its own analysis that a fair sum would be $1bn and $2bn could have been swallowed for the sake of certainty. When the gap is so wide, Barclays is entitled to take its chances in court \u2013 and yes, it probably has an obligation to do so. A board can\u2019t let $2bn slip out of the door just for the sake of a quiet life. The case will be messy, inevitably. Barclays\u2019 practices were \u201cplainly irresponsible and dishonest,\u201d according to Loretta Lynch, the US attorney general. There is also a cache of ugly emails and documents. The DoJ lawsuit says Barclays employees called one parcel of securitised loans \u201ccraptacular\u201d. Another was said to \u201clook like shit\u201d. However, that is almost par for the course in these cases. The central question is the right size of penalty. If Barclays thinks it has been singled out for unduly harsh treatment, the bank should try to prove its case. Staley will look like a fool if he fails, but the willingness to reject the easy option of settling is entirely legitimate.",

If Barclays created and distributed far fewer toxic mortgage securities than its US rivals, which is what the bank argues, why shouldn\u2019t its fine be proportionately smaller?</p> <p>Neither Barclays nor the DoJ is talking hard numbers. But Barclays, it is said, was asked for $4bn, versus its own analysis that a fair sum would be $1bn and $2bn could have been swallowed for the sake of certainty. When the gap is so wide, Barclays is entitled to take its chances in court \u2013 and yes, it probably has an obligation to do so. A board can\u2019t let $2bn slip out of the door just for the sake of a quiet life.</p> <p>The case will be messy, inevitably. Barclays\u2019 practices were \u201cplainly irresponsible and dishonest,\u201d according to Loretta Lynch, the US attorney general. There is also a cache of ugly emails and documents. The DoJ lawsuit says Barclays employees called one parcel of securitised loans \u201ccraptacular\u201d. Another was said to \u201clook like shit\u201d. However, that is almost par for the course in these cases.</p> <p>The central question is the right size of penalty. If Barclays thinks it has been singled out for unduly harsh treatment, the bank should try to prove its case. Staley will look like a fool if he fails, but the willingness to reject the easy option of settling is entirely legitimate.</p>",

      "bodyText": "With the markets closed, City traders are now scarpering to their homes (or the shops!) to begin the Christmas break. So in that spirit, I\u2019m going to wrap up now. I hope you all have an excellent Christmas break. We\u2019ll be back next week for the final push towards 2017. Here\u2019s a quick summary: Britain\u2019s economy has continued to defy the doubters, with growth revised up to 0.6% in the three months after the EU referendum. And with growth earlier in the year revised down, there\u2019s no sign of a Brexit slump. However, the country\u2019s current account deficit has worsened, with exports dropping during the quarter. Economists fear that the economy is still too reliant on domestic demand, as consumer spending could tail off in 2017 when inflation takes a bigger bite out of wages. Over in Italy, the prime minister has confirmed that the country\u2019s weakest banks will be strengthened with state capital, starting with Monte dei Paschi \u2013 whose efforts to bolster its own reserves failed this week. Paolo Gentiloni told reporters that: \u201cToday marks an important day for Monte dei Paschi, a day that sees it turn a corner and able to reassure its depositors.\u201d Two European banks, Deutsche Bank and Credit Suisse, are paying more than $12bn to settle charges that they mis-sold mortgage-backed securities in the run-up to the 2008 crisis. But Barclays is fighting the US Department of Justice, denying that it is guilty of \u2018irresponsible and dishonest\u2019 conduct. Merry Christmas! The London stock market has just closed for the Christmas break, after a very dull session. The blue-chip FTSE 100 index gained a mere 4 points to finish at 7,068. That\u2019s a fairly muted reaction to the news that Britain\u2019s economy performed better that expected in the last quarter, and that the Italian banking crisis is being resolved. The markets seem to have run out of energy, after a wild year. Joshua Mahony of IG says: The lack of volumes associated with the holiday season can often bring the potential for significant volatility, yet in fact we have seen quite the opposite with the post-Trump romp largely brushed aside. With US markets having hit new all-time highs and European markets also enjoying a substantial rally over the past month, there is little complain about this year. However, with the US economy is rude health, the US stock markets reaching new territory, Donald Trump will have a tough time trying to improve on the current state of play. Looking away from the UK economy, the European Central Bank has reported that wealth inequality across the eurozone has risen since the eurozone crisis began. A new ECB survey has found that average net wealth across the euro area shrank by 10% between 2010 and 2014, to \u20ac223,300. This is primarily due to a sharp fall in house prices in many countries, as austerity gripped the euro area. Importantly, the median household wealth (what a typical family owns), was just \u20ac104,100, less than half the mean average of \u20ac223k. That\u2019s because so much wealth is held by the richest people. Households needed to own almost \u20ac500,000 to squeeze into the top 10%. Wealth slumped particularly sharply in Greece and Cyprus, which both entered bailout programme, while net wealth in Germany rose by 10%. And the ECB flags up that wealth inequality appears to have increased slightly. The Gini coefficient, a frequently used indicator of overall wealth inequality, edged up to 68.5 percent from 68.0, which is within the margin of measurement error. A value of 0 corresponds to complete equality, while 100 percent reflects maximum inequality - one household owning all wealth. This could bolster criticism of the ECB\u2019s ultra-loose monetary policy, which has pumped up the value of financial assets owned by richer Europeans. But the Bank argues that without its action, unemployment would be higher and growth lower. Martin Beck, senior economic advisor to the EY ITEM Club, is concerned that UK households will feel a squeeze next year, which could hold back growth. Here\u2019s his comment on today\u2019s growth figures: \u201cQ3\u2019s Quarterly National Accounts brought some unexpected pre-Christmas cheer with Q3 GDP growth revised up from 0.5% to 0.6%. \u201cConsumer spending remained the key driver of growth in Q3, but the first cut of the income data raised further question marks about how long this can continue. Real household income dropped sharply in Q3, taking the annual growth rate to just 0.3%, the weakest outturn for two years. With high inflation set to weigh further on spending power next year, the consumer is surely set to falter soon. If you dig into the meat of today\u2019s GDP report, there are reasons to worry -- even though the UK\u2019s growth rate was revised up to a punchy 0.6%. Household disposable income, for example, dropped by 0.6% during the quarter; the biggest drop in almost three years. And the widening current account deficit (see 10.10am) is another concern. Richard de Meo, managing director of Foenix Partners, says the report shows a \u2018diverging\u2019 economy: Very strong performance in the services sector, the sharpest rise in employee compensation in 3 years and outperformance in construction and industrial production are then firmly offset by very weak figures in household disposable income, continuing declines in business investment and a widening of the current account deficit. The diverging performance of multiple sectors of the economy simply mirrors the uncertainty that Brexit prospects are imposing on the UK outlook, with pockets of robust growth continuing to be frustrated by much bigger questions relating to Britain\u2019s future. The UK government has warned that Britain\u2019s economy faces challenges, despite growing faster than thought in the last quarter. A Treasury spokesperson doesn\u2019t actually mention the Brexit negotiations, but I think we know what they\u2019re hinting at. Here\u2019s the official response: \u201cThe fundamentals of the UK economy are strong, but there remain challenges ahead. The Chancellor set out, in the Autumn Statement, his plan to support a resilient economy that works for everyone by driving productivity and supporting working people, while maintaining fiscal discipline.\u201d Today\u2019s report into the UK economy has good news for workers; compensation paid to employees rose by 4.5% in Q3. That\u2019s the biggest rise since 2013, suggesting robust pay growth over the summer. But..... business investment only rose by 0.4% in the quarter (revised down from 0.9%), which means it was 2.2% LOWER than a year earlier. That indicates that firms did rein in their spending over the summer, after the Brexit vote. Worryingly, Britain\u2019s current-account deficit has widened in the last quarter, as the country continues to import much more than it exports. The difference between money flowing into the UK, and out, jumped to \u00a325.5bn in July-September. That\u2019s the equivalent of 5.2% of the entire economic output this year, close to the record deficit recorded in 2013. This deterioration is mainly due to weaker trade -- Britain\u2019s trade deficit jumped from \u00a311bn in Q2 to \u00a316.7bn in Q3, according to the ONS. Total UK exports decreased by 2.6% in the July-September quarter, while imports increased by 1.4%. That\u2019s despite the slump in the pound, which is meant to help exporters by making goods more competitively priced. The ONS says: Exports of goods decreased by 5.1% in Quarter 3 2016, due mainly to a decrease in exports of aircraft, chemicals and unspecified goods. It\u2019s not all good news, though - the ONS has revised down its estimate of UK growth in January-March to +0.3%, from +0.4%. Growth in the second quarter of 2016 has also been trimmed, from 0.7% to 0.6%. So, the UK economy grew just as fast in the three months after the EU referendum than in the three months after it. But overall, the economy is a little smaller than we thought. NEWSFLASH: The UK economy grew faster than we thought in the three months after the Brexit referendum. The Office for National Statistics has just revised up its estimate for UK GDP in the third quarter of 2016. It now reckons that the British economy expanded by 0.6%, not the 0.5% previously reported. That\u2019s a pretty decent rate of growth, especially given the uncertainty created by the EU referendum. It\u2019s because the ONS has revised up service sector growth (the largest part of the UK economy) in the last three months to 1.0%, from 08%. And the City can take the credit, with output from the \u201cbusiness services and finance industries\u201d growing faster than expected. Darren Morgan, Head of GDP, says: \u201cRobust consumer demand continued to help the UK economy grow steadily in the third quarter of 2016. Growth was slightly stronger than first thought, though, due to greater output in the financial sector.\u201d The ONS also says that industrial production only contracted by 0.4%, not 0.5%, while construction sector output has been revised from -1.1% to -0.8%. More to follow! Today\u2019s flurry of banking news has spared us from the usual pre-Christmas slump. Mike van Dulken of Accendo Markets explains what you need to know: Firstly, overnight news that Monte dei Paschi is set to receive state aid as part of a \u20ac20bn package to keep the bank and troubled peers afloat is something of a relief, even if it does involve taxpayer funds and represents a big d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu, having already been rescued in recent years. It allows savers to have a quieter break following an eventful week that saw the bank struggle and ultimately fail to raise funds privately. Now it\u2019s a question of what price institutional bondholders have to pay and what sort of compensation retail investors will be offered to ensure the bailout follows new EU rules preventing the bill for state aid being unfairly pinned on taxpayers and that the deal is more politically palatable. It also remains to be seen how long the process will take. Talk yesterday of it taking several months to complete is a worryingly long time, allowing unhappy investors to brood and savers take flight, potentially making the current situation even worse. Veloce! News from the US overnight makes for a mixed bag with continental behemoths Deutsche Bank and Credit Suisse settling with the Department of Justice (DoJ) for pre-crisis mis-selling of mortgage backed securities (MBS). The former settled for $7bn (only half payable in cash) which is just half the $14bn challenge that shook markets this summer, something considered to be US retaliation for the EU\u2019s call on Apple to repay Ireland \u20ac13bn in back taxes. Credit Suisse settling for $5bn for similar allegations makes it two out of three. However a pre-Christmas hat-trick eludes the DoJ with UK giant Barclays refusing to give in, viewing claims against it as disproportionate to misdemeanours committed. Considering itself liable for just $1bn, it was happy to settle for $2bn, however, talks have broken down. The DoJ clearly wants more. Deutsche bank shares +3.7% suggests relief at a good result and the affair being closed. Credit Suisse shares flat implies an acceptable deal. Barclays -0.3% indicates some uncertainty about what it eventually ends up paying. However there is no panic. If anything, the standout performer this morning is the bank that has yet to be mentioned. The DoJ wants to fine Royal Bank of Scotland $12bn for its own MBS mis-selling. Its shares are +1.8% on a combination of optimism that it too could settle for half, like Deutsche, although gains may be capped by the prospect of the DoJ taking a dislike to Barclays pushing its luck and decides to make life difficult for the UK City experts are relieved that Italy has finally taken the plunge and agreed to provide \u20ac20bn in emergency liquidity guarantees and capital injections for its banks. There\u2019s also some exasperation that Rome didn\u2019t do this years ago (Britain, for example, pumped money into its financial sector back in 2008). Jacopo Ceccatelli, head of Marzotto SIM SpA, a Milan-based broker-dealer, told Bloomberg \u201cOverall it\u2019s good news; finally we are heading toward a solution,\u201d \u201cItaly is doing now what other countries have done many years ago to sustain their banking system.\u201d Francesco Confuorti, chief executive officer of Milan\u2019s Advantage Financial, \u201cA nationalization should have been done five years ago. \u201cThe bank lost time, money and credibility seeking to keep the patient on life support when he was in an irreversible coma.\u201d More here: Barclays is one of the biggest fallers on the FSTE 100 this morning, shedding 0.8%, after being accused of \u2018irresponsible and dishonest\u2019 practices by the DoJ last night. Unlike many of its rivals, including Deutsche and Credit Suisse, Barclays is fighting charges of mis-selling mortgage backed securities. It has issued a statement to the City, saying: Barclays rejects the claims made in the Complaint. Barclays considers that the claims made in the Complaint are disconnected from the facts. Barclays will vigorously defend the Complaint and intends to seek its dismissal at the earliest opportunity. Shares in Italy banks have jumped by 1.2%, on relief that the Rome government has pledged to strengthen the sector with state help, starting with Monte dei Paschi. Now this is interesting... shares in Royal Bank of Scotland have jumped by 2% at the start of trading in London. RBS is still locked in negotiations with the DoJ over its role in the mortgage-backed securities scandal (which should be familiar to anyone whose seen or read The Big Short, for example). Investors will be concluding that RBS may not be fined as much as feared, given Deutsche Bank\u2019s success in haggling the DoJ down from $14bn to $7bn. Shares in Deutsche Bank have jumped by over 4% at the start of trading in Frankfurt, to \u20ac18.50. That confirms that the $7bn settlement agreed with the DoJ for mis-selling toxic securities is much less than investors had feared. Three months ago, Deutsche\u2019s shares plunged below \u20ac10, the lowest in decades, after news broke that the DoJ was demanding $14bn. Analyst Dan Davies reckons that leak may have rebounded on the US authorities, who were criticised for taking too tough a line over the scandal. The bailout of Monte dei Paschi is an \u201cimportant day\u201d for the bank, says Italy\u2019s new prime minister. After approving the decree that will pave the way to prop up the banking sector, Paolo Gentiloni told reporters that \u201cToday marks an important day for Monte dei Paschi, a day that sees it turn a corner and able to reassure its depositors.\u201d Deutsche Bank\u2019s British CEO, John Cryan, will surely be pleased to have finally settled with the US authorities - and for roughly half the $14bn bill he faced at one stage. Chris Wheeler, analyst at Atlantic securities told the Today programme that: I think the $14bn was always posturing position by the DoJ.... The CEO [John Cryan], a very organised individual, can say that box is now ticked. Today\u2019s flurry of fines, settlements and bailout deals are \u201cgood news\u201d for the European banking sector, says Naeem Aslam, analyst at Think Markets. He points out that Deutche\u2019s Bank\u2019s lengthy negotiations with the DoJ had worried the City. Credit Suisse resolved its issue with Department of Justice over mis-selling of mortgage securities. Similarly, Deutsche Bank has also struck a deal with the Department of Justice in relation to their mortgage-backed securities issue. Deutsche bank\u2019s agreement is less than what the bank feared and this is music to investor\u2019s ears. The amount of $14 billion which was initially expected by Deutsche could have put the bank under a lot of strain. Its stocks plummeted as the bank waited for a result, as traders were not confident about the bank\u2019s ability to carve out a deal. Under the agreement with the DOJ, the total cost will be $7.2 billion. This figure consists of $3.1 billion in penalty fees and $4.1 billion which the bank needs to refund to its consumers. Italian market regulators have suspended trading in Monte dei Paschi\u2019s shares and bonds, following the news that it will be bailed out by the state. The Italian government is likely to end up owning a large stake in MPS, while some bondholders will be \u2018bailed in\u2019 to help fund the rescue deal. Good morning. Christmas has come early for bank watchers, with a packed stocking full of crucial developments on the final day before the festive break. Overnight, the Italian government has given its approval for a state bailout of troubled Monte dei Paschi, after the bank failed to raise funds from private investors. Paolo Gentiloni, Italy\u2019s new prime minister, announced in the early hours of Friday that his cabinet had agreed to the rescue and would be dipping into a \u20ac20bn fund that had already been approved by the parliament earlier this week in the event that MPS needed to be saved. Here\u2019s the full story: In another dramatic, and long-awaited development, Deutsche Bank has finally agreed a $7.2bn settlement with the US Department of Justice for misselling mortgage-backed securities in the run-up to the 2008 crisis. The German lender will pay a $3.1bn civil penalty and also provide $4.1bn in compensation to consumers. It\u2019s much less than the $14bn which the DoJ had originally proposed, and which had raised fears over Deutsche\u2019s financial strength. Swiss bank Credit Suisse has also settled with the DoJ; it will pay a $2.48bn penalty plus handing back $2.8bn to consumers. Late last night it emerged that the DoJ is also taking Barclays to court, after the UK lender denied similar charges of bundling up home loans and selling them on. City editor Jill Treanor explains: The US department of justice has accused Barclays of jeopardising the financial position of millions of American homeowners over a decade-old mortgage bond mis-selling scandal. The DoJ is now taking the bank to court, in what was thought to be the first time an institution had failed to reached a settlement with the US authorities over the sale of residential mortgage-backed securities (RMBS) in the run-up to the banking crisis. Responding to the news on Thursday night, Barclays said it would fight the case. Loretta Lynch, the US attorney general, said: \u201cFinancial institutions like Barclays occupy a position of vital public trust. Ordinary Americans depend on their assurances of transparency and legitimacy, and entrust these banks with their valuable savings.... As alleged in this complaint, Barclays jeopardised billions of dollars of wealth through practices that were plainly irresponsible and dishonest. With this filing, we are sending a clear message that the department of justice will not tolerate the defrauding of investors and the American people.\u201d I\u2019ll be tracking all the development and reaction, as the City heads into its final trading session before Christmas (trading ends at lunchtime, hurrah!). At 9.30am we get a new estimate of UK GDP in the third quarter, which will give more details of how the economy performed in the three months after the Brexit vote. It\u2019ll probably confirm that the economy expanded by 0.5% in the quarter.",

This is primarily due to a sharp fall in house prices in many countries, as austerity gripped the euro area.</p> <p>Importantly, the median household wealth (what a typical family owns), was just \u20ac104,100, less than half the mean average of \u20ac223k. That\u2019s because so much wealth is held by the richest people.</p> <p>Households needed to own almost \u20ac500,000 to squeeze into the top 10%.</p> <p>Wealth slumped particularly sharply in Greece and Cyprus, which both entered bailout programme, while net wealth in Germany rose by 10%. </p> <p>And the ECB flags up that wealth inequality appears to have increased slightly.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The Gini coefficient, a frequently used indicator of overall wealth inequality, edged up to 68.5 percent from 68.0, which is within the margin of measurement error. A value of 0 corresponds to complete equality, while 100 percent reflects maximum inequality - one household owning all wealth.<br></p> </blockquote> <p>This could bolster criticism of the ECB\u2019s ultra-loose monetary policy, which has pumped up the value of financial assets owned by richer Europeans.

Considering itself liable for just $1bn, it was happy to settle for $2bn, however, talks have broken down.

      "bodyText": "With deft accuracy, a design worker is sticking sparkles on a gift bag in an office festooned with crackers, wrapping paper swatches and shelves loaded with multicoloured glitter. Based near a former colliery in south Wales, a team of 45 designers work on new creations for IG Design Group \u2013 the world\u2019s biggest producer of wrapping paper and crackers. The team started designing for next Christmas in August. One worker says she often gets home to find glitter in her car, on her hair, even on the dog: \u201cIt can be Christmas every day here.\u201d Loss-making and struggling under a mountain of debt in 2008 after a string of acquisitions, IG has survived by restructuring, and broadening its product ranges to include stickers, gift bags and other new products alongside traditional wrap and cards. The wrapping paper is made in Wales while the design team\u2019s other creations are turned out at IG\u2019s factories in China and the Netherlands. Paul Fineman, chief executive of the group, says order books for next year are \u201cheaving\u201d because the drop in the value of the pound post-Brexit has boosted demand from abroad. The group produces 1bn m of wrapping paper a year, almost half of which is made in Wales. It supplies all the major supermarkets and major international retailers including Ikea and Costco. Upmarket crackers, under the Tom Smith brand, sell for up to \u00a3500 and will be adorning the royal Christmas dinner table. In October, IG sent a selection of four specially selected cracker designs to Buckingham Palace so that the Queen could choose one to grace her Christmas table. Its products may be swathed in glitter, but the factory in Ystrad Mynach, a short drive from Newport, is an example of gritty British survival against the odds. Previously IG had three sites \u2013 one where wrap was printed, one where it spun huge printed reels of paper onto cardboard tubes and another where goods were packed up ready for stores. The group spent \u00a38m on bringing the whole operation together in one site two years ago. It switched to using more environmentally friendly and efficient water-based inks and introduced new processes that can add glitzy touches such as holograms and shiny finishes. \u201cIn 2008 we had to seriously think whether we could make this a viable facility,\u201d says Fineman. \u201cIt was loss-making and had a lot of issues. We had choices and one of those choices would have been that this place didn\u2019t have a future as a manufacturing site. But we felt if we could remodel, find different customers and channels and create a sufficient resource to invest that not only could we survive but it would be very profitable. It was very challenging but it is working.\u201d IG\u2019s enormous printing machines have 10 heads that layer ink onto a polymer roll on which the design has been laser cut so it stands proud like a giant potato print. Paper from reels more than 1m thick is fed through the printing system before being dried in a long oven and then sliced in half as it is spun back into another thick roll. The plant can print 72km of paper an hour, and employs up to 450 people at peak times about half of whom work in manufacturing. From September the printing machines are working 24/7 right up until Christmas week to cope with late orders from British retailers. Production restarts for next Christmas almost immediately and shipping begins from June or July with boxes of wrapping paper packed off to Bristol docks and shipped over the Atlantic. The company is having a good year. Underlying sales were up more than a fifth in the six months to the end of September with profits up 36% as gift bag sales soared. Fineman says the fall in sterling will bring another boost. \u201cThe UK is going to be a very uncertain place. But over the next 12 to 18 months UK manufacturing, the number of cards sold is up 5% year on year. \u201cSending Christmas cards has declined other than single cards to close relatives. \u201cPeople aren\u2019t just writing out cards to their colleagues at work. But there are new occasions and reasons to send cards all the time. People just see a card and think \u2018that\u2019s fun\u2019 and get it. There doesn\u2019t have to be a specific reason any longer.\u201d IG is also trying the same trick with crackers \u2013 with versions for Halloween and Easter. Some of the crackers are designed in Wales but they are made at the company\u2019s factory in China from which it ships to 29 countries. Last year it imported 60m crackers to the UK \u2013 nearly one for every person in the country. And who writes the jokes? The company employs a network of freelancers, but anyone can contribute an idea. Even Fineman claims to have contributed a couple over the years, although he won\u2019t reveal what they are. Maybe it\u2019s the one about \u201ctinsel-itis\u201d.",

The wrapping paper is made in Wales while the design team\u2019s other creations are turned out at IG\u2019s factories in China and the Netherlands.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/dec/22/supermarkets-to-rake-in-900m-in-christmas-spend-on-super-friday\">Supermarkets to rake in \u00a3900m in Christmas spend on Friday</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Paul Fineman, chief executive of the group, says order books for next year are \u201cheaving\u201d because the drop in the value of the pound post-Brexit has boosted demand from abroad.</p> <p>The group produces 1bn m of wrapping paper a year, almost half of which is made in Wales. It supplies all the major supermarkets and major international retailers including Ikea and Costco. Upmarket crackers, under the Tom Smith brand, sell for up to \u00a3500 and will be adorning the royal Christmas dinner table.<br></p> <p>In October, IG sent a selection of four specially selected cracker designs to Buckingham Palace so that the Queen could choose one to grace her Christmas table.</p> <p>Its products may be swathed in glitter, but the factory in Ystrad Mynach, a short drive from Newport, is an example of gritty British survival against the odds. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b492770c35ea01b2f4784a06cc6095995a825c43\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b492770c35ea01b2f4784a06cc6095995a825c43/0_0_2060_1236/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A designer creates a wrapping paper layout on screen.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A designer creates a wrapping paper layout on screen.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tom Smith</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Previously IG had three sites \u2013 one where wrap was printed, one where it spun huge printed reels of paper onto cardboard tubes and another where goods were packed up ready for stores. The group spent \u00a38m on bringing the whole operation together in one site two years ago. It switched to using more environmentally friendly and efficient water-based inks and introduced new processes that can add glitzy touches such as holograms and shiny finishes.</p> <p>\u201cIn 2008 we had to seriously think whether we could make this a viable facility,\u201d says Fineman. \u201cIt was loss-making and had a lot of issues. We had choices and one of those choices would have been that this place didn\u2019t have a future as a manufacturing site. But we felt if we could remodel, find different customers and channels and create a sufficient resource to invest that not only could we survive but it would be very profitable. It was very challenging but it is working.\u201d</p> <p>IG\u2019s enormous printing machines have 10 heads that layer ink onto a polymer roll on which the design has been laser cut so it stands proud like a giant potato print. Paper from reels more than 1m thick is fed through the printing system before being dried in a long oven and then sliced in half as it is spun back into another thick roll.</p> <p>The plant can print 72km of paper an hour, and employs up to 450 people at peak times about half of whom work in manufacturing. </p> <p>From September the printing machines are working 24/7 right up until Christmas week to cope with late orders from British retailers. Production restarts for next Christmas almost immediately and shipping begins from June or July with boxes of wrapping paper packed off to Bristol docks and shipped over the Atlantic.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6c09b81427cada01da1b7a083aa4354572209a64\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6c09b81427cada01da1b7a083aa4354572209a64/0_19_1280_768/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tom Smith Christmas crackers\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tom Smith Christmas crackers</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tom Smith</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The company is having a good year. Underlying sales were up more than a fifth in the six months to the end of September with profits up 36% as gift bag sales soared.</p> <p> Fineman says the fall in sterling will bring another boost. \u201cThe UK is going to be a very uncertain place. But over the next 12 to 18 months UK manufacturing, the number of cards sold is up 5% year on year.</p> <p>\u201cSending Christmas cards has declined other than single cards to close relatives. \u201cPeople aren\u2019t just writing out cards to their colleagues at work. But there are new occasions and reasons to send cards all the time. People just see a card and think \u2018that\u2019s fun\u2019 and get it. There doesn\u2019t have to be a specific reason any longer.\u201d</p> <p>IG is also trying the same trick with crackers \u2013 with versions for Halloween and Easter. Some of the crackers are designed in Wales but they are made at the company\u2019s factory in China from which it ships to 29 countries. Last year it imported 60m crackers to the UK \u2013 nearly one for every person in the country.</p> <p>And who writes the jokes? The company employs a network of freelancers, but anyone can contribute an idea. Even Fineman claims to have contributed a couple over the years, although he won\u2019t reveal what they are. Maybe it\u2019s the one about \u201ctinsel-itis\u201d.</p>",

      "bodyText": "American Apparel has closed all but one of its 13 UK stores with the loss of 150 jobs. The Los Angeles-based fashion brand, known for hotpants and slinky leggings, put its UK business into administration last month just before the troubled parent company agreed a deal to be taken over by Canadian T-shirt maker Gildan Activewear. Gildan is buying the worldwide rights to the American Apparel brand for $66m (\u00a354m) and taking on its stocks, but does not want the group\u2019s 230 global stores, just under half of which are in the US. American Apparel in the US has also filed for bankruptcy and the retailer has begun winding up its businesses in Spain, Japan and Australia as part of the deal with Gildan, which is expected to be finalised early next year. The only Irish store closed a few weeks ago. Jim Tucker and Richard Beard of KPMG, who are acting as joint administrators of the UK business, said 31 staff based at the last remaining UK store in Camden, north London, and the London head office would be retained in the short term. \u201cOver the last seven weeks, we have carried out our intention to trade all of the stores on a short-term basis in order to sell the stock and realise value for the creditors. The Camden store will remain open into January,\u201d Tucker said. American Apparel, which makes all its clothes in the US, has endured a difficult period since the departure of its controversial founder, Dov Charney, in 2014. The parent company filed for Chapter 11, the US version of administration, just over a year ago, and its chief executive, Paula Schneider, stepped down in September after her turnaround strategy failed to take off. Charney launched American Apparel while at university in 1989, combining fashionable clothing with ethical production based entirely in the US. The brand expanded to more than 20 countries and more than 200 stores, and became the biggest clothing manufacturer in America. But the retailer attracted notoriety for racy advertising, often featuring young female staff members, and for the exploits of Charney, who faced a string of increasingly lurid allegations about his treatment of women. Changing fashion trends, the financial crisis and increasing competition also meant young shoppers were less keen to pay \u00a330 for one of the brand\u2019s plain T-shirts.",

In normal times, a quarterly growth rate of 0.6% would be wholly unexceptional for Britain and hardly worthy of comment. The economy has tended to expand by about 2.0% to 2.5% a year, so 0.6% over three months is about par for the course. These, though, were not normal times. The expectation of the Bank of England, the International Monetary Fund, the Treasury and the Organisation for Economic Cooperation was that a vote to leave the EU would result in instant economic carnage. Threadneedle Street predicted that the economy would barely grow in the third quarter. George Osborne talked about a year-long DIY recession. As it happens, the economy grew at precisely the same rate in the third quarter as in the second quarter. Not only was there no recession, there was no slowdown either. By and large it was business as usual, with the economy displaying all its traditional strengths and weaknesses. Consumers carried on spending as if nothing had happened and imports were sucked in as a result, leading to a deterioration in the balance of payments. Manufacturing performed badly but financial and business services did well. In the circumstances, the small rise in business investment was both surprising and encouraging. The signs are that the final three months of 2016 will see more of the same. Retail sales have remained strong, the service sector continues to expand while industry struggles. Between 2015 and 2016 the economy will grow by about 2%. A number of conclusions can be drawn from this data. One is that the economy would probably have grown even faster had it not been for the referendum. Instead of cutting interest rates, the Bank would probably have raised them by now. A second is that there is no guarantee that the solid performance in the second half of the year will continue. Inflation is poised to rise sharply early in 2017 and that will lead to a slowdown in consumer spending. Finally, any satisfaction to be gleaned from the economy outperforming the expectations of the IMF, the Treasury et al has to be tempered by the fact that the UK is still running a quarterly balance of payments deficit of 5% of gross domestic product.

      "bodyText": "On the last trading day before Christmas - and a curtailed one at that - markets are struggling to find direction. But one sector is in the spotlight and that is of course the banks, following news that Deutsche Bank had agreed a much lower than threatened $7.2bn (\u00a35.9bn) fine to the US Department of Justice over mis-selling toxic bonds. Credit Suisse has also settled but Barclays, down 2.9p at 224.1p, has refused and faces legal action. HSBC has fallen 7.5p to 647.7p. Royal Bank of Scotland, which could face a bill of up to \u00a39bn according to analysts, has risen 1.5p to 229.5p on hopes that Deutsche will provide a precedent and the fine will be lower than feared. Investec analyst Ian Gordon said: We note that Deutsche Bank\u2019s $7.2bn settlement is substantially lower than the US DOJ\u2019s \u201cinitial demand\u201d for around $14bn. Although RBS... is not yet in formal negotiations with the DOJ \u2013 it has yet to agree [a] settlement.. \u2013 we do see the quantum of the Deutsche Bank settlement as offering positive \u201cread-across\u201d for RBS. On Barclays, Gordon said: The civil claim alleges mail and wire fraud, but does not quantify the monetary penalties sought. Media reports (Bloomberg) suggest that Barclays was unwilling to settle for more than $2.0bn. Barclays says that it will now \u201cvigorously defend\u201d the Complaint. Barclays has not yet taken a provision in relation to any possible.. settlement with the DOJ, and at this stage it remains unclear whether it is likely to do so in the fourth quarter of 2016. If, given obvious litigation uncertainties, it were to determine that is still unable to quantify the likely outcome and therefore elects not to take a provision then (perhaps counterintuitively) this should support upgrades to 2016 consensus expectations for total net asset value .. and core tier 1 ratio.. However, we anticipate that the market may now price in the risk of a higher settlement cost in 2017. Although we judge Barclays\u2019 decision not to settle as a net negative, there are a number of theoretical upside risks. Members of the UK Parliamentary Treasury Select Committee have repeatedly called for UK Government intervention to support/defend the position of UK banks vis-\u00e0-vis the US DOJ. Moreover, with the impending change of regime in the US, it is possible (albeit not certain) that there could be an improvement in UK/US co-operation under President-Elect Trump. Barclays (and others) could yet enjoy collateral benefit from such developments. Meanwhile Italy\u2019s Monte dei Paschi has been bailed out by the government after the failure of its proposed fundraising. Overall the FTSE 100 has dipped 5.05p to 7058.63, despite better than expected third quarter GDP figures for the UK. AstraZeneca has added 1% to \u00a343.87 as it completed the sale of its small molecule antibiotics business to Pfizer. AstraZeneca has received an initial $550m, and will get another $175m in January 2019 and up to $850m depending on performance as well as certain royalty payments. Among the mid-caps PayPoint has put on 16.5p to 962.5p after it sold its mobile payments business to Volkswagen Financial from \u00a326.5m. Analyst David McCann at Numis said: PayPoint has announced that it has agreed to sell its mobile business to VW financial services for \u00a326.5m cash or 38.9p a share. This is materially higher than the \u00a32.2m or 3p the business had been impaired to by management in the last accounts. The gross proceeds (38.9p) will be paid out as a special dividend on 11th Jan. This compares to our expectation of a special dividend related to its sale of 3p in the current half. Whilst it is positive to see that PayPoint has finally achieved a sale and the price is much higher than management concluded it was worth in the accounts a few weeks ago, it should be remembered that this is lower than the price paid for the business in 2010 (\u00a329m+\u00a34m contingent) and it has been unprofitable during this holding period. Nonetheless, we believe shareholders have received an early Christmas present today in the form of an unexpectedly positive special dividend of 38.9p: around 36p more than we and most thought would be the case. It is also good that another line has been drawn under a long running issue for the company, that will allow management to now focus on the core business.",

      "body": "<p>On the last trading day before Christmas - and a curtailed one at that - markets are struggling to find direction.</p> <p>But one sector is in the spotlight and that is of course the banks, following news that <strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/dec/23/deutsche-bank-credit-suisse-us-mortgage-securities-barclays\">Deutsche Bank had agreed a much lower than threatened $7.2bn (\u00a35.9bn) fine</a></strong> to the US Department of Justice over mis-selling toxic bonds. Credit Suisse has also settled but <strong>Barclays</strong>, down 2.9p at 224.1p, has refused and faces legal action. <strong>HSBC </strong>has fallen 7.5p to 647.7p.</p> <p><strong>Royal Bank of Scotland</strong>, which could face a bill of up to \u00a39bn according to analysts, has risen 1.5p to 229.5p on hopes that Deutsche will provide a precedent and the fine will be lower than feared. Investec analyst Ian Gordon said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We note that Deutsche Bank\u2019s $7.2bn settlement is substantially lower than the US DOJ\u2019s \u201cinitial demand\u201d for around $14bn. Although RBS... is not yet in formal negotiations with the DOJ \u2013 it has yet to agree [a] settlement.. \u2013 we do see the quantum of the Deutsche Bank settlement as offering positive \u201cread-across\u201d for RBS.</p> </blockquote> <p>On Barclays, Gordon said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The civil claim alleges mail and wire fraud, but does not quantify the monetary penalties sought. Media reports (Bloomberg) suggest that Barclays was unwilling to settle for more than $2.0bn. Barclays says that it will now \u201cvigorously defend\u201d the Complaint.</p> <p>Barclays has not yet taken a provision in relation to any possible.. settlement with the DOJ, and at this stage it remains unclear whether it is likely to do so in the fourth quarter of 2016. If, given obvious litigation uncertainties, it were to determine that is still unable to quantify the likely outcome and therefore elects not to take a provision then (perhaps counterintuitively) this should support upgrades to 2016 consensus expectations for total net asset value .. and core tier 1 ratio.. However, we anticipate that the market may now price in the risk of a higher settlement cost in 2017.</p> <p>Although we judge Barclays\u2019 decision not to settle as a net negative, there are a number of theoretical upside risks. Members of the UK Parliamentary Treasury Select Committee have repeatedly called for UK Government intervention to support/defend the position of UK banks vis-\u00e0-vis the US DOJ. Moreover, with the impending change of regime in the US, it is possible (albeit not certain) that there could be an improvement in UK/US co-operation under President-Elect Trump. Barclays (and others) could yet enjoy collateral benefit from such developments.</p> </blockquote> <p>Meanwhile Italy\u2019s Monte dei Paschi has been <strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/dec/22/italy-bail-out-monte-dei-paschi-di-siena-rescue-matteo-renzi\">bailed out by the government after the failure of its proposed fundraising.</a></strong></p> <p>Overall the <strong>FTSE 100</strong> has dipped 5.05p to 7058.63, despite better than expected third quarter GDP figures for the UK.</p> <p><strong>AstraZeneca</strong> has added 1% to \u00a343.87 as it completed the sale of its small molecule antibiotics business to Pfizer.

Today\u2019s elites include bankers and politicians. The masses are disillusioned citizens voting their frustration. That dichotomy is the difference between what central banks say and what people feel. Last week, the US Federal Reserve raised interest rates by a quarter point. The financial press applauded the start of a tightening phase as reflecting economic stability. This happened last year too. On 16 December 2015, the Fed also raised rates by 25 basis points (0.25%). It forecast four rate hikes for 2016. We got one. The forecast is now three for 2017. If the past is prelude, we might get another one. For eight years, the Fed has institutionalised a policy of being wrong, on forecasting rate hikes, economic growth, and financial stability. That\u2019s why \u201cemergency measures\u201d to provide liquidity (to banks) became an eight-year strategy for providing artificial stimulus to banks and markets. Once the Fed initiated its 2008 zero interest rate policy (ZIRP) and quantitative easing programmes, they were exported globally. Central banks copied these policies and added regional flavour. Last year, Fed chair Janet Yellen anticipated \u201cgradual adjustments in the stance of monetary policy\u201d with a moderately-paced expansion of economic activity and strengthening of the labour market. This year, the federal open market committee (FOMC) assured: \u201cThe stance of monetary policy remains accommodative.\u201d According to Yellen, the Fed is acting \u201cunder a cloud of uncertainty\u201d. That\u2019s code for waiting for the other shoe to drop, on the markets or banks. The message is that rate hikes follow economic growth. But voting in the US and globally says something else. During the first presidential debate, Donald Trump accused \u201cthis Janet Yellen of the Fed\u201d of being \u201cpolitical by keeping the interest rates at this level\u201d. Establishment democrats that supported Hillary Clinton were enraged. They noted the real economy wasn\u2019t as bad as Trump made out. Yet Trump won. Not because his voters were racist, xenophobes (though some are), but because of prevalent economic anxieties of working class Americans, notably in the rust-belt states he swept. For all his bombastic bluster and his selection of the richest cabinet ever, Trump\u2019s read of the population was correct. He captured its participation deficit \u2013 in stock market escalation, bank resurrections, and glorified reductions in headline unemployment figures. And the anger. From Brexit to Trump to trans-European anti-EU votes spanning Italy to eastern Europe (Poland, Hungary, Macedonia, Bulgaria and Moldova) with a looming possibility of Geert Wilders winning the Netherlands\u2019 election in March, and Marine Le Pen in France, financial stability is a core issue. The average person might have no clue about the particulars of central bank policy fabricating speculative capital. But everyone is well aware that economic rewards floated to the banks and the wealthy. They are desperate for change. Grandiose promises act as immediate salves. Last year\u2019s Fed rate hike spurred a 10\u201320% stock market drop depending on the country. To compensate, the Bank of Japan introduced negative interest rate policy in January, and the European Central Bank in March. Both have extended their versions of quantitative easing since. Not to be outdone, and in a coincidental reaction to Brexit, Bank of England governor Mark Carney slashed rates in Britain from 0.50% to 0.25% in August. In October, despite skirmishes with prime minister Theresa May, he announced he would remain at the Bank of England until 2019, covering the two-year article 50 period. If we see a repeat of last year\u2019s global reaction to the Fed\u2019s hike, the only major central bank with room to cut rates to zero will be the Bank of England. That signals ZIRP coming to Britain, along with an even lower British pound. This would not help Britain\u2019s mounting job and economic woes any more than any of the other central banks\u2019 manoeuvres did in their countries. But Carney will say it will. Carney slashed capital requirements in July. He pressed banks to lend more to the real economy. But words aren\u2019t binding. Lenders will do what they have always done: act in their own interest. Over in the US, Trump selected a cadre of Wall Street and big business sympathisers for his court. They like cheap money. His campaign browbeating of Yellen fell flat given this rate hike. Having chaired Bill Clinton\u2019s council of economic advisers in the 1990s, she also happens to be his link to Clinton. He needs Yellen to go slow on the Fed rate hike gas pedal in order to keep banks and markets happy during his rule. In this Tale of Two Cities, there is only one Fed.

    "webTitle": "Deutsche Bank and Credit Suisse agree multi-billion-dollar settlements with US", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The US Department of Justice has extracted $12.5bn in settlements from Deutsche Bank and Credit Suisse for a decade-old toxic bond mis-selling scandal. It has also started legal proceedings against Barclays, which, in an unprecedented move, has refused to settle with the authorities. Deutsche, Germany\u2019s biggest bank, will pay $7.2bn (\u00a35.9bn) to the DoJ. The sum is considerably less than the $14bn originally demanded. Credit Suisse has agreed to pay $5.3bn. Both settlements relate to the complex packaging of home loans, which was a lucrative business for the banking industry until the 2008 crisis. The DoJ did not disclose the size of penalty it wanted to levy on Barclays, but it is understood to be $4bn. It accused the bank of \u201cplainly irresponsible and dishonest\u201d conduct. The flurry of announcements just hours before the markets closed for the Christmas holiday came weeks before Donald Trump takes over as US president and follows months of negotiation between the banks and the DoJ, led by the US attorney general, Loretta Lynch. The scandal dates back to 2005 and 2007, when banks packaged up home loans and used them to help create bonds \u2013 known as residential mortgage-backed securities (RMBS) \u2013 which were sold to investors. The mortgage repayments made by borrowers then provided a yield to the investor, so long as the borrower kept paying. The schemes fell apart when loans were made to borrowers who were unable to repay. The penalties are part of Barack Obama\u2019s efforts to hold banks accountable, and the first major agreements to be reached with non-US banks. JP Morgan, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, Bank of America Merrill Lynch and Citi have all been punished already. There are further penalties to come, notably for Royal Bank of Scotland. The bank could face a bill of as much as \u00a39bn, analysts have said. Its shares rose 1% on hopes that it might soon be able to reach a settlement with the DoJ \u2013 which it had hoped would take place this year \u2013 or at least start to estimate its own bill. Deutsche shares, which initially jumped 4%, ended almost 1% higher. Credit Suisse and Barclays slipped 1% in thin pre-holiday trading. Under the settlement, Deutsche will pay $3.1bn and provide $4.1bn in customer relief, such as loan modifications and other assistance to homeowners and borrowers, spread over five years. Credit Suisse will pay $2.5bn and compensation of $2.8 bn over five years. Much of the focus was on Deutsche, run by Briton John Cryan, which had been contesting the authorities\u2019 original $14bn fine. When that news first leaked, its shares plunged to 31-year lows over fears about its ability to withstand such a high bill. There had been fears that Deutsche would need to embark on a cash call or even ask the German government for assistance, but the fact that $4.1bn of its payout for customer relief was not a lump sum helped soothe some of the anxiety. \u201cA key area of concern has been removed,\u201d analysts at Goldman Sachs said, noting that the $1.2bn hit Deutsche would take in its fourth quarter was \u201ctowards the lower end of market expectations\u201d. Some analysts said Deutsche would need to press on with its restructuring to avoid a cash call. \u201cPositively, the deal is settled and out of the way, as it was thought that the issue could drag on into 2017,\u201d said Thomas Kinmonth, an analyst at ABN Amro, who added that without restructuring a cash call would have to be undertaken before 2019. Deutsche\u2019s shares have been pummelled on stock markets during 2016 over fears about its financial position. It had already set aside billions of euros in anticipation of the fine. Barclays is the first bank to fail to reach a settlement and now faces lengthy court proceedings in New York to defend itself against claims it said were \u201cdisconnected from the facts\u201d. Two of its executives, Paul Menefee and John Carroll, are named by the DoJ.

      "bodyText": "Labour have accused the Treasury of failing to fully tackle tax avoidance as it claimed to have identified a \u00a32.6bn black hole created by downgraded revenue forecasts. John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, said that information buried in the small print of last month\u2019s Office for Budget Responsibility report showed that three tax avoidance measures were now expected to raise significantly less than when they were first announced. McDonnell said that collectively the three schemes would now raise a total of \u00a32.6bn less than planned between 2014-15 and 2018-19, which he said was equivalent to the cost of employing 12,000 nurses over that period. He said the problem was particularly serious because the NHS was facing \u201can unprecedented squeeze on its finances\u201d. The three schemes highlighted by Labour are: accelerated payments, a rule demanding upfront payments in avoidance cases; measures to tackle tax avoidance in partnerships; and debt market integrator schemes, which market the recovery of government debt. Accelerated payment was originally expected to raise \u00a31.1bn over the five-year period, but is now expected to raise \u00a3800m less, according to the OBR. The partnership schemes are forecast to raise \u00a31.5bn less than the \u00a33.3bn originally expected. And revenue from the debt market integrator schemes is forecast to be \u00a3300m less than hoped for over the period. McDonnell, who has said that tackling tax avoidance would be a Labour priority, suggested that part of the problem was HMRC underfunding. He said the OBR report itself reported that HMRC was blaming \u201cthe current level of funding\u201d for the fact that it could not recoup all the money it was hoping for from one of its schemes. A Treasury spokeswoman said: \u201cAll individuals and businesses have a responsibility to pay the tax they owe. \u201cIn this year\u2019s autumn statement, we announced over 30 measures that will tackle avoidance, evasion and aggressive tax planning, which will raise \u00a318 billion over the next five years.

    "webTitle": "Italian cabinet gives green light to Monte dei Paschi di Siena bailout", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The Italian government has agreed to a bailout of Monte dei Paschi di Siena (MPS) after the world\u2019s oldest bank admitted that it had failed to raise \u20ac5bn (\u00a34.25bn) from private investors as part of a last-ditch plan to rescue the bank. Paolo Gentiloni, Italy\u2019s new prime minister, announced in the early hours of Friday that his cabinet had agreed to the rescue and would be dipping into a \u20ac20bn fund that had already been approved by the parliament earlier this week in the event that MPS needed to be saved. The government announced that its first step would be to strengthen the bank\u2019s ability to procure liquidity. If necessary, the bank can move ahead with a sale of state-backed bonds. Pier Carlo Padoan, the finance minister, did not specify how much the rescue would cost the Italian state, but he said funds would be sufficient to cover the bank\u2019s capital requirements. \u201cThis will secure MPS\u2019s capital needs and allow the bank to continue its industrial plan. Italy\u2019s third largest bank will finally return with force to operate in support of the Italian economy and in a contest of full tranquillity for its savers and its employees,\u201d Padoan said. The government said junior bondholders \u2013 who under new EU rules must take a hit before any state intervention \u2013 would be able to convert their bonds into shares, which will then be converted into senior debt. The announcement brought to an end months of uncertainty about MPS\u2019s fate after the bank embarked on an attempt to first raise billions of euros on the private market. In a statement on Thursday night, MPS said that the attempt \u201chas not ended with success\u201d. \u201cIn particular, there were no manifestations of interest on the part of an anchor investor who could have put a significant investment in the bank and this negatively affected decisions of institutional investors,\u201d MPS said. MPS\u2019s board met on Thursday night after it failed to secure an anchor investor, thought to be the Qatar sovereign wealth fund. Within hours of that announcement, Gentiloni convened his cabinet and formally approved the state rescue plan. The bank also announced that the two investment banks that tried unsuccessfully to arrange the private investment \u2013 JP Morgan and Mediobanca \u2013 would not receive any fees for their work. Shares in the bank were volatile during the day, lifting off record lows but then falling back in the confusion surrounding the next steps. The shares \u2013 down 85% this year \u2013 slumped by 7.5%. MPS is under instruction from the European Central Bank to bolster its finances after it was found to be the weakest of 51 European banks subjected to stress tests. The failure to convince Qatar to inject up to \u20ac1bn means that Italy will have to impose losses on bondholders before it can stump up cash because of new EU rules intended to prevent taxpayers from picking up the bill for bank losses. However, about \u20ac2bn of the bonds are held by private investors, and the government suggested that arrangements were in place to protect those junior bondholders. The bailout is not just a financial issue. It is also expected to have political consequences for Italy\u2019s controlling Democratic party and Matteo Renzi, the former prime minister who stepped down from office earlier this month after he was roundly defeated in the referendum on 4 December. While Gentiloni has taken over as interim prime minister, Renzi is expected to run for election again as early as next year. Wolfango Piccoli, an analyst with Teneo Intelligence, said a government rescue might not be immediately damaging politically, in large part because public attention will be diverted from the issue during the Christmas period. But the issue could become \u201cpolitically toxic\u201d later, once it becomes clear how many of the bank\u2019s junior bondholders are eventually compensated for their losses, and how long it takes for them to be paid. \u201cIn terms of the junior bondholders, let\u2019s see what happens. it will eventually be decided by Brussels,\u201d Piccoli said. Once MPS is saved, a number of other banks could also require government support. \u201cThis will drag on for some time. If we have elections in May or June, it will be used then [against Renzi\u2019s Democratic party], and there is no way to deflect that,\u201d he added. The bail-in of bondholders should help reduce the amount of funds the Italian government must contribute to MPS. Analysts at Barclays said any state intervention for MPS may not be enough to solve the problem facing the banking system, which has amassed bad lending at a time when the economy has been stagnating. They said the six largest banks could need \u20ac30bn to clean up their balance sheets and even if the \u20ac20bn \u201cwere to represent sufficient firepower to plug the hole, we doubt the decision to deal with MPS through a public sector solution will represent a template to be unrolled across the system quickly\u201d. The \u20ac5bn fundraising from private investors was complex, involving a cash call on shareholders, asking bondholders to swap their investments for equity, and also parcelling off bad debts. The \u20ac4.25bn Atlante fund \u2013 set up by Renzi and backed by larger banks to prop up banks \u2013 had been expected to hoover up the problem loans.",

In a statement on Thursday night, MPS said that the attempt \u201chas not ended with success\u201d. </p> <p>\u201cIn particular, there were no manifestations of interest on the part of an anchor investor who could have put a significant investment in the bank and this negatively affected decisions of institutional investors,\u201d MPS said.</p> <p>MPS\u2019s board met on Thursday night after it failed to secure an anchor investor, thought to be the Qatar sovereign wealth fund. </p> <p>Within hours of that announcement, Gentiloni convened his cabinet and formally approved the state rescue plan.</p> <p>The bank also announced that the two investment banks that tried unsuccessfully to arrange the private investment \u2013 JP Morgan and Mediobanca \u2013 would not receive any fees for their work.</p> <p>Shares in the bank were volatile during the day, lifting off record lows but then falling back in the confusion surrounding the next steps. The shares \u2013 down 85% this year \u2013 slumped by 7.5%. MPS is under instruction from the European Central Bank to bolster its finances after it was found to be the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jul/29/rescue-package-in-place-as-europes-oldest-bank-fails-stress-tests\">weakest of 51 European banks subjected to stress tests</a>.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/dec/21/italys-20bn-bailout-fund-to-rescue-monte-dei-paschi-di-siena\">Italy to bail out Monte dei Paschi di Siena bank with \u20ac20bn rescue fund</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The failure to convince Qatar to inject up to \u20ac1bn means that Italy will have to impose losses on bondholders before it can stump up cash because of new EU rules intended to prevent taxpayers from picking up the bill for bank losses. However, about \u20ac2bn of the bonds are held by private investors, and the government suggested that arrangements were in place to protect those junior bondholders. </p> <p>The bailout is not just a financial issue. It is also expected to have political consequences for Italy\u2019s controlling Democratic party and Matteo Renzi, the former prime minister who <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/dec/11/italy-paolo-gentiloni-to-succeed-matteo-renzi-as-prime-minister\">stepped down from office earlier this month</a> after he was roundly defeated in the referendum on 4 December. While Gentiloni has taken over as interim prime minister, Renzi is expected to run for election again as early as next year.</p> <p>Wolfango Piccoli, an analyst with Teneo Intelligence, said a government rescue might not be immediately damaging politically, in large part because public attention will be diverted from the issue during the Christmas period. But the issue could become \u201cpolitically toxic\u201d later, once it becomes clear how many of the bank\u2019s junior bondholders are eventually compensated for their losses, and how long it takes for them to be paid. </p> <p>\u201cIn terms of the junior bondholders, let\u2019s see what happens. it will eventually be decided by Brussels,\u201d Piccoli said. Once MPS is saved, a number of other banks could also require government support. </p> <p>\u201cThis will drag on for some time. If we have elections in May or June, it will be used then [against Renzi\u2019s Democratic party], and there is no way to deflect that,\u201d he added.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/dec/22/monte-dei-paschi-the-history-of-the-worlds-oldest-bank\">Monte dei Paschi di Siena: a brief guide to the world's oldest bank</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The bail-in of bondholders should help reduce the amount of funds the Italian government must contribute to MPS. </p> <p>Analysts at Barclays said any state intervention for MPS may not be enough to solve the problem facing the banking system, which has amassed bad lending at a time when the economy has been stagnating. They said the six largest banks could need \u20ac30bn to clean up their balance sheets and even if the \u20ac20bn \u201cwere to represent sufficient firepower to plug the hole, we doubt the decision to deal with MPS through a public sector solution will represent a template to be unrolled across the system quickly\u201d.</p> <p>The \u20ac5bn fundraising from private investors was complex, involving a cash call on shareholders, asking bondholders to swap their investments for equity, and also parcelling off bad debts. The \u20ac4.25bn Atlante fund \u2013 set up by Renzi and backed by larger banks to prop up banks \u2013 had been expected to hoover up the problem loans. </p> <p><br></p>",

      "bodyText": "A London square whose wealthy residents have included Margaret Thatcher and Sean Connery has been crowned the most expensive in England and Wales with an average house price of nearly \u00a317m. Eaton Square, in the upmarket Belgravia district of west London, topped a list dominated by addresses in the capital, according to an annual survey by Lloyds Bank. But the lender\u2019s research also found that every region in England and Wales now has at least one \u201cmillion-pound street\u201d. Built by the Grosvenor family in the 19th century, Eaton Square features grand homes and apartments featuring Grade II-listed white stucco facades. It has been home to at least three prime ministers and two James Bonds, with Connery and Roger Moore both lending it a touch of 007 glamour, contributing to an average house price of \u00a316.9m. The sum is more than double last year\u2019s highest average price of \u00a38m, on Victoria Road in Kensington &amp; Chelsea. The bank said this did not reflect a broader surge in house prices, but was more likely to do with the small number of transactions in any given period, which means that one astronomical sale can distort the average. One home on Eaton Square sold for \u00a325m earlier this year, dragging the street\u2019s average up, despite an overall slowdown in multimillion-pound house purchases. At nearly \u00a317m, the average price on the street is more than three times higher than in the most costly areas outside London, Weybridge and Leatherhead. The two Surrey towns account for eight of the country\u2019s top 20 priciest streets with Camp End Road in Weybridge at the top of the pile with an average house price of \u00a35.2m. But addresses in the capital dominate the list of the most expensive streets, with seven of the top 10 found in just two London boroughs, Westminster and Kensington. While London dominates the list, the Lloyds research revealed that every region in England and Wales now has at least one street where the average house price is more than \u00a31m. Outside London and the south-east, the wealthiest addresses are those in, or close to the millionaires\u2019 playground of Sandbanks in Poole on the Dorset south coast. Panorama Road is the most exclusive address on the highly sought-after peninsula, with houses priced at \u00a34.6m on average. Crick Road in Oxford also scrapes into the top 20 at slightly more than \u00a34m. Altrincham in Greater Manchester is home to northern England\u2019s highest house prices, at an average of \u00a32m, followed by Leycester Road in Knutsford, Cheshire, at \u00a31.79m. Most of the north-east\u2019s highest entries are in or near Newcastle, led by Runnymede Road in Ponteland, Northumberland, at \u00a31.1m, while East Anglia\u2019s list is topped by Storey\u2019s Way in Cambridge at \u00a31.9m. The West Midlands is represented by Farquhar Road in Edgbaston (\u00a31.4m), with the east Midlands not far behind at \u00a31.3m for a home on Warren Hill in Newton Linford, Leicester. The seaside resort of Llandudno takes top spot in Wales, with the average home on Llys Helyg Drive just squeezing in above the \u00a31m mark. Yorkshire and the Humber are dominated by the \u201cGolden Triangle\u201d between Harrogate, Wetherby and north Leeds, with Ling Lane in Leeds the most expensive at \u00a31.3m. In Devon and Cornwall, the city of Truro comes first, with homes on Restronguet Point selling for \u00a31.8m. Andrew Mason, mortgage director at Lloyds Bank, said: \u201cEaton Square, and prime central [London] locations such as Westminster, and Kensington and Chelsea, have established reputations as exclusive addresses. \u201cNot only do these streets possess a rich historical legacy, but properties located there are some of the most prestigious in the world and are close to superb local amenities in Knightsbridge, Sloane Street and Chelsea, as well as the capital\u2019s business and entertainment districts.\u201d \u201cAway from London, our figures show that the most expensive streets tend to be tightly clustered within pockets in the same area. For example, the Edgbaston district in Birmingham, the Wilmslow and Altrincham areas in Cheshire, the so-called \u2019Golden Triangle\u2019 in Yorkshire and the Humber and Sandbanks in Dorset on the south coast.\u201d The data was compiled from more than 1.7m postcodes, using Land Registry data for transactions between January 2011 and October 2016. \u2022 This article was amended on 23 December 2016. An earlier version suggested incorrectly that Runnymede Road was in Newcastle.",

      "bodyText": "The government is being urged to clinch a transition arrangement for the City of London during Brexit negotiations to assuage concerns of employers who are delaying business decisions because of the uncertainty created in the run up to the UK\u2019s departure from the EU. The City of London Corporation, the local authority that covers much of the financial district, urged Theresa May to arrange transition arrangements \u201cas soon as possible\u201d. Mark Boleat, policy chair of the City of London Corporation, said: \u201cBrexit has brought with it a significant amount of uncertainty for businesses in the services sector. \u201cImportant strategic business decisions are being delayed and much needed investment postponed or withdrawn altogether. Firms\u2019 nervousness can only be allayed if they know how they can continue running their business. A transitional arrangement should be agreed as soon as possible.\u201d There are suggestions that triggering article 50 in March \u2013 signalling the formal process of exiting the EU \u2013 could prompt firms to start implementing contingency plans to ensure they are able to continue conducting business while a Brexit deal is agreed. Boleat said: \u201cTheresa May\u2019s government has the most complex and nationally important international negotiations since the end of second world war ahead of it, and for the good of British business and workers in Britain we must get this right.\u201d Despite his urge for clarity, Boleat added: \u201cI have no doubt that whatever happens in 2017 that the City of London will remain the world\u2019s leading financial centre. However we cannot be complacent and must continue investing in infrastructure and education while working to secure the best possible business links with the European Union and the world.\u201d The corporation has published data showing that financial and professional and financial services employ more than 2.2 million people across the UK, not just in the City. Boleat did not outline the detail of what he thought a transition agreement should contain. He is not alone in calling for such a deal. Sam Woods deputy governor of the Bank of England, told MPs on the Treasury select committee earlier this month that details of that arrangement would be needed within nine months of article 50 being triggered. Woods told the MPs that firms could roll out their contingency plans in a few months. Chancellor Philip Hammond has said the government would seek a transitional deal to help smooth the Brexit process in order to avoid disruption that could risk Britain\u2019s \u201cfinancial stability\u201d. The Lloyd\u2019s of London insurance market is said to be preparing to open a subsidiary in another European country in preparation for Brexit and other City institutions are expected to follow suit. The vote for Brexit is thought to be among the reasons that the UK arm of Santander has revised the way it intends to implement the ring fencing rules designed by Sir John Vickers. Banks must comply with these requirements to separate the high street and investment banking arms by 2019. Nathan Bostock, chief executive of Santander UK, said: \u201cThe newly approved business model retains the majority of our operations within one ring-fenced bank, providing greater certainty for our customers and flexibility for the future.\u201d",
