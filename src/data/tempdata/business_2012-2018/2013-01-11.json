      "bodyText": "Bumi has done enough damage already to its shareholders' wealth and the reputation of the London stock market. The last thing it needs is the return of its creator, Nat Rothschild. Astonishingly, however, a couple of big-name City fund managers, including Schroders' Richard Buxton, have declared themselves backers of Rothschild's plan to throw out 12 of 14 current directors and install himself and a hand-picked crew in their place. These outside shareholders should pause and recall how Bumi, an adventure into the exciting world of Indonesian coal mining, fell into its deep hole. Short answer: Rothschild did a spectacularly bad deal. Remember the history. In 2010 Rothschild created a shell company, Vallar, and raised \u00a3700m to seek riches in natural resources. A partnership deal soon followed to buy into Indonesian coal mines controlled by the Bakries, a family who had not always generated headlines that reassure strait-laced institutional investors in London. The Bakries would own 47% of London-listed Vallar, to be renamed Bumi, but that apparently wasn't a problem because everybody would get along just fine. Ho, ho. Bumi has been one quarrel after another. Rothschild, having ceded the right to appoint the chairman and chief executive of the London-listed company, discovered he in was no position to call the shots, notwithstanding the force of his understandable complaints about governance at the Indonesian end. He quit the board last October. Given the farcical chain of events, and a share price down 70%, one can understand why Rothschild would be embarrassed and wish to play a role as salvage man, or the person to oversee the unwinding of the cross-shareholdings with the Bakries. But it's a mystery as to why Schroders, owner of 4% of the shares, think he's suitable. Sir Julian Horn-Smith, the ex-Vodafone man who is Bumi's senior non-executive director, should have known better than to get involved in the first place. But he was spot-on this week when he said Bumi's governance, operational and legal headaches \"essentially derive from the original deal that Nat Rothschild was instrumental in putting together\". For good measure, Horn-Smith reminded investors that the Takeover Panel, the City's watchdog on deals, is investigating why the existence of a concert party between the Bakries and a firm controlled by fellow Indonesian Rosan Roeslani wasn't declared on day one. His statement continued: \"The board notes that the next stage of the panel investigation will be to establish any culpability and appropriate disciplinary action, which the board assumes will include a focus of Vallar plc's principal adviser at that time, Vallar Advisers LP, which was led by Nat Rothschild.\" At the very least, outside shareholders should have taken that as a warning to reserve judgment on Rothschild's attempted return until the panel has spoken. Instead, a \"back Nat\" campaign is up and running. Baffling. Has Lloyds time finally come? Rejoice, fellow shareholders, our punt on Lloyds Banking Group is going well \u2013 or, at least, less badly. The best-performing FTSE 100 stock of 2012 (it doubled) has started 2013 at electric pace, up 10% so far to 54p amid the general market optimism. It's time to dream. The state's in-price on the \u00a320bn bailout of Lloyds was 63p if one takes account of the \u00a32.5bn returned to public coffers via the bank's exit from the asset insurance scheme. Suddenly break-even on our 39% shareholding doesn't seem far away. UK Financial Investments, the body charged with managing the state's bank holdings, needs to awake from its slumber \u2013 there could be a selling opportunity here for the government. You can hear the refrain now: Labour nationalised banks in a crisis; we've brought them back to health and can start repaying the taxpayer. That's a decent line for a chancellor who may soon find the UK stripped of its triple-A credit rating as the economy enters a triple-dip recession. How, you might wonder, have Lloyds' shares risen from 22p in the autumn of 2011 in such a cold climate? Isn't the bank, as the country's largest mortgage lender, a proxy for the health of the UK economy? Yes, but there has always been another argument: Lloyds is so big and dominant in domestic savings and loans that it can't fail to make a shed-load of money one day. The latter thought is now uppermost, especially as the banks have had a few presents recently \u2013 liquidity rules have been loosened and the Bank of England's funding for lending scheme is in full swing. \"Normal service is being resumed,\" declared UBS' bank-watcher this week. He has a 12-month target price on the shares of 60p and thinks Lloyds \"is clearly going to deliver rising margins, falling costs and falling provisions which should provide a very strong upswing to profitability and earnings per share momentum over the next few years.\" But here's the trickier part for the government: mere break-even for the public purse could imply an almighty windfall for Lloyds management. It's a function of the V-shaped path of the share price and the fact that the lucky Lloyds crew got a bundle of incentive shares near the bottom. An announcement last March recorded carrots that included 41.3m shares for the top executives \u2013 the quantity was calculated on the basis of a 34.8p share price. Some 9.5m shares were allocated to chief executive Ant\u00f3nio Horta-Os\u00f3rio and the rest split between nine individuals. Performance conditions and deferral provisions, and all that, apply. But throw in other incentives and assume Lloyds gets back to the 63p starting point. The back-of-envelope maths suggests the top 10 Lloyds executives could be looking at share-based rewards worth \u00a335m-\u00a340m between them, even at the point where the state's profit is zero. Them's the rules of the incentive scheme agreed by UKFI, of course, and maybe the voters would just be thankful for Lloyds' recovery. Or maybe they would point out that \"ongoing regulatory largesse\", in the cute phrase of another City analyst, is a large part of this story. That fun lies ahead \u2013 but maybe sooner than assumed. Unexpected CVs in the bagging area An intriguing whisper from the boardroom of a quoted-company retailer: they have been astonished by a flood of unsolicited job applications from Tesco executives in recent months. These are not from members of Tesco's high-ranking executive committee \u2013 we're talking levels below that. What does it mean? Tesco's chief executive, Philip Clarke, is cracking the whip, as you'd expect, but the post-Leahy internal revolution may not be universally acclaimed. 'Tis the season to stay silent As Marc Bolland at Marks &amp; Spencer might agree, retailers' Christmas trading statements are more trouble than they're worth. What's the point? They give bald sales numbers, which can be misleading in isolation. Sales are vanity, profits are sanity, is the old retailing wisdom. Next is the exception. It helpfully updates its profit forecast. The rest boast about how many mince pies they sold and, in case of Sainsbury's and Tesco, they bicker about the right way to calculate like-for-like sales figures. True, Christmas is critical for shopkeepers. But an overload of reporting, it is now widely agreed, distracts managements and encourages short-term thinking. Cut the clutter: if a retailer has real seasonal news to convey, good or bad, let it speak; if not, it should stay silent until the next scheduled results.",

The company has agreed to hold the meeting, which is thought to be scheduled for February. Among the shareholders, Schroders, which owns more than 4% of the company, is said to be backing Rothschild. Rothschild led the London flotation of Bumi two years ago, when it was known as Vallar and the shares began trading at \u00a310 each. The shares inched lower on Friday to 304p. The company started life as a \u00a3700m cash shell intended to make acquisitions in the mining industry and was renamed Bumi after taking a 29% stake in the mining business controlled by the Bakrie family. The saga has fascinated the City, particularly as Rothschild had worked furiously to become known as a serious financier and shed the playboy image of his university days, when he was famously a member of Oxford University's Bullingdon Club at the same time as the chancellor, George Osborne.",

      "bodyText": "European markets have ended the week on a - fairly - positive note, as the January rally continues despite some mixed economic news during the day, not least the UK industrial production figures and a widening US trade gap. \u2022 The FTSE 100 has finished 20.07 points or 0.33% higher at 6121.58 \u2022 Germany's Dax is up 0.09% \u2022 France's Cac has climbed 0.08% \u2022 Italy's FTSE MIB is 0.29% higher \u2022 Spain's Ibex is 0.53% better \u2022 But the Athens market has dipped 0.52% Meanwhile the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 0.06%. And with that it's time to close up for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, have a good weekend and see you back here on Monday. Greece has delayed a decision on the future of struggling lender Hellenic Postbank from today until next week, according to Reuters, after potential buyers pulled out: Efforts at finding a buyer failed when three of the country's biggest banks withdrew from the race, leaving authorities no choice but to split the bank in two and run its healthy assets as a stand-alone entity. The Greek central bank had been expected to announce its plan for the bank on Friday, but delayed the decision to next week after European Union and International Monetary Fund lenders asked to study its business plan, a banker familiar with the matter said. \"The troika asked for a few days to assess the business plan of the 'good' bank,\" the banker said, referring to the trio of the EU, ECB and IMF. The bank's non-viable assets are expected to be liquidated. Standard &amp; Poor's has reaffirmed its BBB+ long term rating for Ireland, at the same time as keeping its negative outlook. The agency said: The Irish government has made strong progress in stabilising its fiscal position, although risks associated with its high deficits and debt burden, and the challenge of complying with the EU/IMF fiscal adjustment program, still persist. We consider that the economic outlook for Ireland is also improving, although we see significant downside risks given its reliance on exports for its recovery. The negative outlook reflects our view of prevailing downside risks to financial sector stability and the government's balance sheet given high net public borrowing needs, and uncertain growth prospects for the domestic economy. The institute said: [We interpret] the term \u201crecession\u201d to mean a period when output is falling or receding, while \u201cdepression\u201d is a period when output is depressed below its previous peak. Thus, unless output turns down again, the recession is over, while the period of depression is likely to continue for some time. We do not expect output to pass its peak in early 2008 until 2014. But despite \"the recession is over\" could we be heading for a triple dip? Some think so: The UK's economy showed virtually no growth at all last year, according to the latest report from National Institute of Economic and Social Research. The thinktank estimated it shrank by 0.3% in the final quarter of 2012, which tallies with a recent batch of poor industrial output and construction figures. This compares to a rise of 0.1% in the third quarter, but this was put down to \"distortions\" such as the London Olympics. The US trade figures are \"absolutely awful\", according to Rob Carnell of ING Bank. He said: The deficit widening to $48.7bn went in completely the opposite direction to most forecasters assumptions, and, moreover, was a very big swing by trade data standards. We cannot blame this swing on the petroleum sector \u2013 the petroleum balance was almost unchanged at -$10.7bn from -$10.97bn in October. Neither was this mainly a result of exports, which picked up 1% month on month, to $182.6bn. The damage was instead cause entirely by imports, and in particular, by goods imports, which soared, from $186.8bn to $195.0bn. Of these goods imports, big positive swings are most obvious in consumer goods and to a lesser extent in automotive goods. What is slightly odd about this is that although you could read this as a positive spin on domestic demand sucking in more imports, the retail figures over the end of 2012 have actually been pretty soft, which suggests that although there may be an offset to the drag on imports in the fourth quarter of 2012, it may have led to an unwarranted inventory build up, and this may weigh on growth in the first quarter of 2013, at a time when payrolls tax expiry is already weighing on growth. Across the Atlantic and some poor trade data from the US. The trade deficit unexpectedly grew 16% to $48.7bn in November, thanks to a jump in imported consumer goods. Analysts had been looking for a fall to around $41bn. Instead they got the worst number since April. Cyprus must pursue economic reforms but deserved \"solidarity\" from the European Union, Angela Merkel has said. Joining the chorus of politicians commenting on the country's financial problems, the German chancellor made the comments as she arrived for the meeting of centre-right leaders. (HT Reuters) And are there signs of cost cutting among EU leaders? Developments in Cyprus -- Finnish prime minister Jyrki Katainen has declared that he would support a bailout for the country, but suggested we might need to get next month's election out of the way first. Speaking in Limassol, Cyprus, at the meeting of centre-right leaders (see 10.40am), Katainen said: The challenges are really huge, but I'm sure if and when the country can get a new and strong and committed leadership capable of strengthening confidence ..it will have a tremendous positive impact. (via Reuters). And I've got to dart off now, so Nick Fletcher is taking over the blog. Thanks, and have a great weekend all. GW The slump in European car sales has hit the UK town of Swindon, where 800 jobs are being cut at the Honda plant. Honda pined the blame for the cuts \u2013 the first since it came to Britain in the early 1990s \u2013 on the sharp fall in European car sales. Alarmingly, Honda doesn't expect any meaningful growth in the European market for the next four years. It's entirely the car market. I've written a bit more about it here: Honda cuts 800 jobs at Swindon as European car sales slump Greek PM Antonis Samaras is also attending the EU leaders' meeting in Cyprus. In the bond markets, optimism that the euro crisis is easing has helped Italy to sell \u20ac3.5bn of bonds at average yields of just 1.85%. That's the lowest borrowing cost for this kind of bond since March 2010. Another example of the 'positive contagion' which Mario Draghi mentioned at yesterday's ECB press conference. Analysts at Goldman Sachs reckon Spanish debt will also continue its recent recovery: Ireland's Enda Kenny is also in Cyprus for the EU leaders meeting (see previous post). He's told the press pack that the Cypriot bailout might have to wait until a new government is installed after next month's elections: With impeccable timing, centre-right politicians from across Europe are gathering in Cyprus today. The meeting of the European People's Party (EPP) begins at 11am GMT, or 1pm EET, in Limassol. German chancellor, Angela Merkel, and European Commission President, Jose Manuel Barroso, are among those attending There's a live feed from the event here, which just showed Barroso arriving Officially, the meeting will focus on the EU budget - but Cyprus's bailout crisis could also be discussed in the corridors... The euro has hit a nine-month high of 82.42p against the pound following this morning's weak industrial data (see 9.56am), and is also a little higher against the dollar at $1.327. Analysts at the Bank of Toyko suggest this may not be a great sign: Weak UK industrial data has raised fears that Britain is heading into a triple-dip recession. Manufacturing output fell by 0.3% in November, and was 2.1% smaller than a year ago. That's rather worse than the 0.5% month-on-month rise that analysts had expected, and indicates that the UK economy shrank again in the last quarter of 2012. At \u20ac17bn, Cyprus's demands aren't huge compared to the potential cost of bailing out Italy or Spain. But it's roughly equal to the country's annual economic output \u2013 illustrating the dire state its banks are now in. European leaders are desperate to avoid a repeat of the Greek debt haircut. Analysts, though, suggest there may be no way to avoid imposing losses on the private sector --called a Private Sector Involvement (PSI). Nicholas Spiro of Spiro Sovereign Strategy commented: Even a bank-focused bailout would cripple the sovereign given the small size of the economy while an EU taxpayer- financed rescue of Russian oligarch-funded Cypriot banks would prove extremely controversial. All this strengthens the case for a \u2019tiny PSI\u2019, one which eurozone policy makers would hope would slip under radar. That's why the cost of insuring Cypriot bonds against default jumped this morning (see 9.06am) - traders see a greater chance of a debt restructuring. Bloomberg has a good analysis here. A quick reminder of the situation in Cyprus: \u2022 Cyprus is seeking a bailout of around \u20ac17bn, including at least \u20ac10bn to recapitalise its banking sector. \u2022The negotiations over Cyprus's bailout request have stalled over the issue of economic reforms and privatisations. The 'Troika' of international lenders (the IMF, the EU and the European Central Bank) insist that Cyprus must sell stakes in some state assets in return for help. That has been rejected by outgoing communist president Dimitris Christofias. \u2022 German MPs are concerned that a bailout would benefit money-launders who allegedly hold huge sums in Cypriot banks. They have threatened to veto any aid package. \u2022 A new president will be chosen in next month's elections, and there are rumours that the bailout will be delayed until March. \u2022 Cyprus, though, insists that it is a victim of Greece's own crisis (Cypriot banks were big holders of Greek debt). It says claims of 'dirty money' in its banking sector are unfair, and simply wants a fair deal from its European allies. The cost of insuring Cyprus's debt against default has jumped this morning, as traders react to Moody's triple-notch downgrade (see 8.07am) The credit default swap on Cyprus's five-year bonds jumped by 111 basis points to 1,139bp, according to Markit. That means it would cost \u20ac1.139m per year to insure \u20ac10m of five-year Cypriot debt against default, implying a very high risk of a 'credit event'. Elsewhere in the world economy, the Japanese government has agreed its eagerly anticipated stimulus package. It is committing over 20 trillion yen (\u00a3138bn) to a new stimulus package that (it hopes) will drag Japan out of recession. The prime minister, Shinzo Abe, insisted the plan would get results: Unfortunately the previous administration failed to work out how to boost growth and expand the economic pie. It is vital that we have an economic strategy that can create jobs and raise incomes to sustain growth. Here are full details on the plan. Japan has seen countless stimulus packages since its financial crash of the late 1980s, and none have really worked. This time, Tokyo is also suggesting that the Bank of Japan should widen its mandate to include Japanese unemployment levels - which could give it the mandate to be more aggressive. In response, the yen has fallen to a new two and half-year low against the dollar overnight. EU Commissioner Olli Rehn has declared that there is no chance of a debt restructuring for Cyprus. Rehn, the European Economic and Monetary Affairs Commissioner, told the German business daily Handelsblatt that: A haircut is not an option for us. Brussels had a tough lesson last year during the \u20ac100bn Greek debt restructuring, which dragged on for months. Officials have indicated that the experiment (driven by a desire for private creditors to share the pain) would not be repeat if at all possible. Good morning, and welcome to another day of rolling coverage of the eurozone financial crisis. Overnight, Cyprus has been hit by a credit rating downgrade, putting more pressure on Nicosia as it tries to negotiate a bailout. Moody's slashed its rating on Cyprus by three notches to Caa3 - just three above outright default - with a negative outlook, and warned that the country's debt burden will rise sharply. With negotiations over an aid package still deadlocked, Moody's also fears that Cyprus may be unable to service its debt burden. Sarah Carlson, a senior credit officer with Moody's sovereign risk group, explained: We think that there's a higher likelihood that the government may default outright or press for a distressed exchange. In its official statement, Moody's warned that Cyprus's government would face more demands from its banking sector, which has suffered heavy losses on its Greek bonds. The key driver of today's rating action is the anticipated rise in the Cypriot government's debt burden, driven principally by the increased recapitalization needs of its banking system following distressed exchanges on Greek government debt and rising delinquencies on loans to Greek and Cypriot obligors. Cyprus's financial problems have been on the back burner for months. With an election just over a month away it is now becoming more of a issue - and a reminder that the eurozone crisis isn't over, despite recent progress. I\"ll be watching for more developments on Cyprus in the hours ahead, along with other developments in Europe and beyond....",

Of these goods imports, big positive swings are most obvious in consumer goods and to a lesser extent in automotive goods.</p> <p> What is slightly odd about this is that although you could read this as a positive spin on domestic demand sucking in more imports, the retail figures over the end of 2012 have actually been pretty soft, which suggests that although there may be an offset to the drag on imports in the fourth quarter of 2012, it may have led to an unwarranted inventory build up, and this may weigh on growth in the first quarter of 2013, at a time when payrolls tax expiry is already weighing on growth.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-50f0178495cb06c7e4c65aee\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-01-11T13:45:41.009Z\">1.45pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">US trade gap jumps</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Across the Atlantic and some poor trade data from the US.</p> <p>The trade deficit unexpectedly grew 16% to $48.7bn in November, thanks to a jump in imported consumer goods.

The administrators, Edward Williams, Rob Hunt and Matthew Hammond of accountants PwC, said a review of the business had quickly revealed it was no longer viable. They said stores will not open on Saturday and customers will be unable to return any purchases. Hunt said: \"We have reviewed the position of the business and held extensive discussions with suppliers around their support for ongoing trading. \"It is apparent that we cannot continue to trade and as a result we have had to make the difficult decision to begin the closure of all 187 Jessops stores at the close of business today. \"Regrettably, this will result in around 1,370 job losses across the stores with further job losses likely, in due course, at the head office in Leicester. He said stock will be collected from all the shops over the coming days and returned to a central warehouse. \"It will be returned to suppliers if they are entitled to it. As a consequence of the closure, Jessops is no longer able to accept returned product from customers,\" he said. Jessops is one of many high street names to go bust in the last year. It follows electrical retailer Comet and JJB Sports into the shop graveyard, with analysts saying there are likely to be many more victims before the economic recovery takes hold. Figures covering the Christmas period show shoppers were reluctant to spend while wage rises remain constrained and cuts to welfare payments are in the pipeline. Only a handful of upmarket chains, including John Lewis, improved their sales significantly. Estimates by the National Institute for Economic and Social Research on Friday suggested that the economy, which is suffering from a combination of austerity at home and a desperate lack of exports to European markets, may have contracted in the final three months of 2012. A second quarter of contraction at the start of 2013 would signal the onset of a triple-dip recession. x-ref p25",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "January's market rally has shown no signs of running out of steam, with the leading index remaining at a level not seen since before the collapse of Lehman Brothers. Buoyed by hopes of an improving global economy, the FTSE 100 finished at 6121,58 on Friday, up 20.07 points on the day and 30 points on the week. The last time it was this high was on 22 May 2008, well before the financial crisis really blew up. The optimism began at the turn of the year with the - temporary - resolution of the US budget problems, the so-called fiscal cliff, and investors have barely looked back since. The market even managed to shrug off poor UK industrial production figures yesterday which suggested the country could be heading for a triple-dip recession. Angus Campbell at Capital Spreads said: The avoidance of the fiscal cliff, some good economic data, decent business surveys, good eurozone peripheral debt bond auctions and the pushing back of the Basel deadlines [for banks' capital requirements] have all meant that investors are upping the ante and happy to buy into equities in 2013, but there's every chance that this enthusiasm could lead to complacency. Banks were among the week's best performers after winning concessions from regulators over the amount of capital they must hold. They have been given four more years to build up their cash buffers against another Northern Rock-style collapse, as well as being granted more flexibility over the range of assets they can include, the Basel committee of banking supervisors announced last weekend. Lloyds Banking Group added 0.74p on Friday to 54.04p, Royal Bank of Scotland rose 3.6p to 360.4p and Barclays was 5.05p better at 299.65p. International Airlines Group, the owner of British Airways and Spain's Iberia, was flying high after a broker upgrade. Analysts at UBS moved from neutral to buy on hopes of a successful resolution to its plans to restructure Iberia, as well as the prospect of a recovery in the global economy. The airline, which last week unveiled a 0.3% rise in passenger traffic in December compared to a year ago, added 10.7p to 207.6p, the biggest riser in the FTSE 100. But Tullow Oil was on the slide after a disappointing trading update, falling 39p to \u00a311.86. The oil and gas company reported average daily production of 79,200 barrels of oil equivalent, slightly below expectations of 80,000 to 84,000. It said: This slight shortfall versus the most recent guidance was caused by the enforced shutdown of Tullow's non-operated production in the [parts of the] UK in early December 2012 following a safety incident. It reported no new drilling results, and said it would write off a total of $670m in its full year results, including $219m for dry holes and licence relinquishments in the second half. Brian Gallagher at Investec said: This morning's trading update delivered disappointing production figures for Tullow and underlined our view that it may not attain production of 100,000 or more until as late as 2018 (disposal dependent). This will put greater pressure on the exploration portfolio to deliver exceptional results, we think. We reiterate our negative stance and maintain our 1000p price target. Meanwhile higher than expected Chinese inflation figures took the shine off mining shares, with BHP Billiton down 57p at \u00a320.75 and Kazakhmys closing 17.5p lower at 808.5p. Marks &amp; Spencer suffered a disastrous week, as the retailer was forced to rush out its Christmas trading statement a day early after the figures were leaked to Sky News on Wednesday evening. In the event they showed a disappointing 3.8% fall in clothing and general merchandising sales over the festive season, with food sales up just 0.3%. HSBC yesterday cut its recommendation from overweight to neutral and its price target from 420p to 390p. Marks shares recovered from an early slump to close at 372.5p on Friday, up 3.7p and just ahead of where they stood before the leak. Among the supermarkets, Tesco reported a strong Christmas performance, despite a spat with rival J Sainsbury about what exactly was included in its sales figures. Tesco dipped 2.2p to 353.2p while Sainsbury slipped 1.7p to 324p as analysts at Merrill Lynch pointed to another challenging year ahead for food retailers. ITV was in the spotlight with analysts suggesting January advertising would be better than expected, helped by a dispute between media buyer Group M - part of WPP - and rival Channel 4. The row saw some business moving from Channel 4 to ITV, and Liberum Capital was still positive on ITV even as the disagreement was settled. Analyst Ian Whittaker said: If you see any weakness [in ITV shares] on the news, we would use this as an opportunity to buy. January underlying trading actually looks stronger than what media buyers were thinking it would be a month back (likely to be 3%-5% up for ITV Family in January) and the spate of retail results (Tesco's doing well, Morrison's and Marks doing badly over Xmas) is likely to act as a catalyst for retail and supermarket ad spending, which is the biggest category for ITV. ITV rose 2.3p to 110p. Among the other risers Arm added 6.5p to 870p as the chip designer benefited from suggestions of a new Apple iPhone as well as positive comments from the Las Vegas consumer electronics show. Aviva climbed 12.1p to 380.1p as Citigroup upgraded its rating on the insurer to buy from neutral with a 479p price target. The bank said: We think Aviva is one of the most attractive opportunities in the sector this year. Despite recent gains, Aviva trades at a substantial discount to UK peers and European composites. Most importantly we see a number of catalysts from management actions to close this gap in the next two years. Strengthening the balance sheet \u2013 Aviva has suffered from perceived capital weakness relative to peers, so addressing solvency was set as the key restructuring priority. Since the third quarter of 2012, management actions have lifted economic solvency by about 25% to 169% (proforma) and there is more to come. Aviva is building strong free cash generation. We believe Aviva can and will maintain its dividend for full year 2012, while still being able to reduce leverage through redeeming hybrid debt. Improving performance - we estimate that actions taken to date and delivery of the remaining cost cutting programme can raise return on equity from under 4% in 2012 to about 14% in 2014. We therefore believe that Aviva has the opportunity and momentum to close the substantial valuation gap in the next 12 to 24 months, through successful delivery on its restructuring plan. Topping the FTSE 250 was Centamin, up 4.65p to 55.8p, after last week's news that its gold production for 2012 was higher than expected, despite much publicised problems with customs authorities and fuel suppliers in Egypt. Close behind was Moneysupermarket.com. It added 9.7p 168p following news of an expected 15% increase in full year revenues to \u00a3204.5m and anticipated earnings of \u00a366m, up 26%. Recent acquisition MoneySavingExpert.com contributed around \u00a32.8m of adjusted earnings. SuperGroup was back in fashion after the retailer unveiled its autumn range on Thursday evening. The group behind the Superdry brand jumped 34p to 580p as analysts made positive noises ahead of an expected update early in February. It suffered a series of setbacks in the past 18 months or so, including three profit warnings and stock issues, but in December it reported a 3.9% rise in like for like sales in the six months to October. Commenting on the event on Thursday, retail analyst Nick Bubb said: Needless to say, there was no discussion of Christmas trading, ahead of the third quarter update on 7 February, but finance director Shaun Wills was heard bemoaning the lowly level of the share price and pointing out that they would have brought the announcement forward if anything had gone wrong. But HMV continued to struggle, down 0.35p to 1.2p as it launched a 25% off sale to try and bring in some cash. Investors are awaiting its Christmas trading update with some trepidation and are concerned the retailer could breach its banking covenants. Earlier in the week poor results in Europe from US retailer Gamestop prompted further concerns about HMV's own performance. Nick Bubb said: There is still no official news from HMV about how Christmas mas trading went, but the rumour mill is active, with suggestions that the The Big Sale is more than just a usual January stock clearance and that HMV desperately need to get some more money in the bank. We also hear that HMV's long-suffering suppliers are being asked for yet more gross margin support. Unless the suppliers stump up again, the prognosis for HMV is not good. Finally exploration group Ophir Energy dropped 25.5p to 537p on talk of possible delays to its exploration projects. Analysts at Jefferies said: Rig sources have reported that BG has not exercised its extension options on the Deepsea Metro I with Ophir in Tanzania beyond 8 June 2013. Ophir states the joint venture is looking for a cheaper option for drilling in the second half of 2013. We believe this may delay the high-impact exploration on outboard Block 1 and raise doubt in investors' minds about BG's enthusiasm chasing the exploration upside until a new rig is confirmed, weighing on the stock short term.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Pressure mounted on the chancellor to moderate his austerity programme after analysis by a leading thinktank showed the UK economy heading for a triple-dip recession and high profile employers Honda and Jessops cut hundreds of jobs The National Institute for Economic and Social Research (NIESR) said in its monthly health check that the economy shrank by 0.3% in the three months to December. Against a backdrop of weak consumer spending and a drop in manufacturing output, the estimates from NIESR may add fuel to campaigns for George Osborne to adopt a more radical approach to generating growth. Plans by Honda to shed 800 jobs at its Swindon plant added to the dismay among unions and business lobby groups. Honda blamed a lack of demand for cars in recession-hit markets across continental Europe. Car sales were up 5% in Britain during 2012. The Unite union called the decision a \"hammer blow\" for those affected and the Swindon economy, and pointed out that 325 temporary workers had also left recently. Administrators for the camera shop chain Jessops said a discussion with suppliers had revealed the business was no longer viable and all 189 shops would close, making 1370 staff redundant. NIESR said the fall in the final quarter of the year was preceded by an artificially high boost to growth in the third quarter from Olympic ticket sales. Taking the six months as a single period, the economy was flat, just as it was in the first six months of the year. In 2011, the economy grew by 0.9%, said NIESR. The first official estimate for fourth quarter GDP by the Office for National Statistics will be released on 25 January. Britain emerged from recession in the third quarter of last year but a series of gloomy releases \u2013 including weak trade data and downbeat purchasing managers' surveys \u2013 have fuelled fears of a contraction in the final quarter. If output continues to fall in the first quarter of this year, the UK will fall into its third recession in four years. NIESR published its estimates after the ONS said manufacturing output dropped 0.3% in November, after a fall of 1.3% in October. The wider reading of industrial output \u2013 also including output from the energy and mining sectors \u2013 grew by 0.3% following a sharp decline in October, which was revised down further on Friday to -0.9%. November's figures were boosted by an 11.3% jump in oil and gas output \u2013 the biggest increase since 1968 \u2013 after maintenance of the Buzzard North Sea oil field was completed. But manufacturing and industrial production missed expectations, with analysts hoping for rises of 0.5% and 0.8% respectively. Demand for goods in Britain has been hammered by economic uncertainty, below-inflation wage growth and punishing austerity, while exports have been hit by the eurozone crisis. Separate figures out from the ONS on Friday only added to concerns, as construction output dropped 3.4% in November. Chris Leslie, shadow Treasury minister, responding to NIESR's forecast, said: \"Unless we see strong growth in this quarter it will be clear that the last set of figures were little more than a one-off Olympics bounce. \"Under David Cameron and George Osborne's economic policies we've seen squeezed living standards, rising long-term unemployment, a flatlining economy, and borrowing rising by 10% so far this year as a result. So we need strong growth simply to catch up all the ground we have lost over the last two years.\" Honda's job cuts, the first at its British subsidiary, came only months after hiring hundreds of new employees. But expectations of a resurgent European market proved illusory. \"It's entirely the car market,\" said Honda Europe's executive vice-president, Ken Keir, who said demand in the European car market shrank by 1m last year. \"We're not anticipating in mainland Europe any particular growth in the next three or four years,\" Keir told the BBC. Unite national officer Tony Murphy said: \"It's a tragedy for our members and their families. There's no doubt these cuts will have a significant knock-on impact on the supply chain, and on local shops and services.\" A Department for Business, Innovation and Skills spokesman said the government would work with local partners to minimise the impact of the job losses. \"Times are tough in the European market but the automotive industry remains a major success story for the UK. Over the last two years global manufacturers including Nissan, JLR and BMW have invested \u00a36bn in the UK, safeguarding and creating new jobs.\" The company will begin a consultation period with staff, and says it hopes to avoid compulsory layoffs at the plant, which manufacturers Civic, Jazz and CR-V models.",

    "webTitle": "Boeing 787 Dreamliner to be investigated by US authorities", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Boeing's troubled 787 Dreamliner is to face a full review of its design and manufacture by the US government after two more incidents were reported \u2013 making five in five days for the model that promised to revolutionise flying. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) announced a comprehensive review of the 787's critical systems, including the design, manufacture and assembly, but stressed its confidence in the plane's safety. The US transportation secretary Ray LaHood said he would have \"no reservation in boarding these planes and taking a flight\" but admitted the administration was concerned about recent events and would be looking for the root causes. Pilots on an All Nippon Airways (ANA) domestic flight in Japan reported a crack developing in the cockpit windscreen before landing safely on Friday, while oil was found leaking from the engine of another of the airline's Dreamliners. A string of problems in the last week has threatened to erode confidence in the mould-breaking aircraft, a carbon-composite plane that is at the forefront of the aviation industry's pledges for a greener, quieter future. At Boston airport, a battery started a fire on an empty Japan Airlines 787, while another leaked 40 gallons of fuel on to the taxiway, delaying its takeoff. Another ANA internal Dreamliner flight was cancelled on Wednesday due to a brake control computer glitch. British Airways will be operating Dreamliners this year. Willie Walsh,chief executive of BA's parent company IAG, said: \"We welcome the joint review and remain committed to taking delivery of the aircraft.\" Thomson, which expects delivery of its first Dreamliner next month, and Virgin, which has ordered 16, both stressed they had \"every confidence\" in the safety of the plane. Qatar Airways last month became the first airline to operate regular services to and from Heathrow with the 787. The aircraft, with a list price of $217m (\u00a3134m), has attracted airlines mainly because of its leap in fuel economy, as well as a range that makes emerging destinations possible with fewer passengers. The model's promise of a 40% reduction in noise could also be a key factor in winning over opposition to the expansion of airports around London. Boeing president Ray Conner said the 787 had undergone \"the most robust and rigorous certification process in the history of aviation\". He pointed to similar issues when Boeing's 777 came into service. \"We are not seeing anything exceptionally unusual in what we're going through.\" Conner said that a ramped-up production rate and outsourcing to meet demand had not affected the plane. He also said it was important to note that back-ups and redundancies in the design had worked to ensure safety. \"The planes have performed exactly as designed once the incidents happened.\" Boeing said the Dreamliner had now logged 50,000 hours of flight and there were more than 150 flights occurring daily. The FAA chief Michael Huerta promised \"whatever technical resources necessary\" for the review of an aircraft which is already worth tens of billions of dollars in US export orders. \"Our focus is developing a complete picture. Nothing we have seen so far suggests it is not safe.\" He added: \"It's an extremely important airplane \u2013 we care about maintaining public confidence that it is safe \u2026 [It's] an incredibly fuel efficient airplane \u2013 it represents the future where aviation needs to advance.\" The 787 Dreamliner made its first commercial flight in late 2011, after a series of production delays put deliveries more than three years behind schedule. By the end of last year, Boeing had sold 848 Dreamliners, and delivered 49. Analysts said the problems did not suggest great safety concerns but could pose problems for the aircraft manufacturing giant. Douglas McNeill, investment director at Charles Stanley, said: \"What you're seeing is teething problems not uncommon with new aircraft types. They get tested rigorously but it's different when they come into service. I don't think there is any question over the safety of the aircraft.\" However, he warned: \"Boeing may well be picking up a bill from the airlines and it may cost Boeing money for some while. And coming down the line is the Airbus A350 \u2013 so if Boeing doesn't iron out the problems it may lose out in that competition.\" In 2011, hairline cracks in the wings of A380 aircraft produced by rivals Airbus landed the manufacturer with a repair and service bill of more than \u00a3200m, although it refused to pay compensation for revenue lost while its planes were grounded.",

      "standfirst": "A persistent recession and rising gas prices had put smaller, greener cars in the spotlight \u2013\u00a0but this year, big is back", 
      "body": "<p>Something big is happening at the Detroit auto show this year. Bankruptcy, recession, high gas prices, the still woeful state of the housing market \u2013 all took their toll on America's love of big cars in recent years. As the US car giants prepare to show off their latest creations on their home turf, it looks like 2013 could be the year when big comes back.</p> <p>Smaller, greener cars have dominated the giant North American International Auto Show in Detroit for the past few years. \"This year's story is going to be about the domestic truck,\" says Jesse Toprak, senior analyst at TrueCar.com. \"For the last few years it just didn't feel right. Now it does.\"</p> <p>Big was back, a bit, at the Los Angeles auto show in November. Chrysler showed off its latest Town &amp; Country minivan, Jaguar-Land Rover made the US debut of its latest Range Rover. The $92,000, supercharged V8 engine can do 0-60 in 4.2sec, perfect for outgunning paparazzi on Rodeo Drive. Then there was the Mercedes-Benz Ener-G-Force, a concept SUV with more than a touch of Robocop about it. Built in a response to design a police car for 2025 the SUV would use a \"hydro-tech converter\" to turn water into hydrogen for its fuel cell power, emitting nothing more harmful than water vapor out of its exhaust pipes.</p> <p>LA's car show is about design and flash; Detroit is where the industry gets real. And it looks like even more muscle is going to be revealed next week. Ford is rumoured to have a redesigned F-150 in the pipeline, a half-ton behemoth that has been America's best-selling truck for decades and was last revamped in 2009, as well as all-new full-sized Transit vans. GM has its new Chevrolet Silverado and the GMC Sierra, best-sellers that were last redesigned in 2007. Analysts are expecting big launches from Chrysler and rivals including Toyota.</p> <p>\"Last several years, people who bought trucks were those who had to. Now I think they can make trucks cool again, bring back lifestyle purchasers,\" says Toprak, who used to run a Chevy and Chrysler dealership in the mid-1990s. \"Gas was less than a $1 a gallon,\" he says. \"Back then people would buy these things and never even use the trunk.\"</p> <p>All that changed with the recession and rising gas prices. Worst still, America's car manufacturers became dependent on sales of big cars to make ends meet. As consumers switched to leaner, smaller rivals, the already troubled industry spiraled into bankruptcy. Big cars still make more money for the car makers. GM is believed to make about $10,000 on each Silverado and Sierra it sells.</p> <p>But the balance of power has shifted away from big cars, and even their biggest fans doubt they will be as large a part of the business as they were before the crash.</p> <p>US consumers are expected to buy more than 15m vehicles in 2014 for the first time since 2007, a million more than this year, according to the National Automobile Dealers Association (Nada). It's a big bounce back from a low of 10.4m in 2009 but trucks and sports utility larger cars have so far lagged behind in the recovery, says Nada chief economist Paul Taylor.</p> <p>\"Everyone's pickups have got old in the recession. State and local governments, whose main income has been taxes from the housing market, they haven't been buying. Utility buyers haven't been buying. But that demand is starting to come back,\" he says.</p> <p>Light truck sales are up about 8.9% this year compared to 13.9% for all light vehicles. Small and mid-sized car sales have soared close to 25%. SUVs, once the hottest sellers on the block, were up just 5.1%. Taylor thinks there's still a lot of demand for the SUV out there, but that gas prices will have to come down before people trade up. \"I'm buying gas at $2.97.

      "bodyText": "Something big is happening at the Detroit auto show this year. Bankruptcy, recession, high gas prices, the still woeful state of the housing market \u2013 all took their toll on America's love of big cars in recent years. As the US car giants prepare to show off their latest creations on their home turf, it looks like 2013 could be the year when big comes back. Smaller, greener cars have dominated the giant North American International Auto Show in Detroit for the past few years. \"This year's story is going to be about the domestic truck,\" says Jesse Toprak, senior analyst at TrueCar.com. \"For the last few years it just didn't feel right. Now it does.\" Big was back, a bit, at the Los Angeles auto show in November. Chrysler showed off its latest Town &amp; Country minivan, Jaguar-Land Rover made the US debut of its latest Range Rover. The $92,000, supercharged V8 engine can do 0-60 in 4.2sec, perfect for outgunning paparazzi on Rodeo Drive. Then there was the Mercedes-Benz Ener-G-Force, a concept SUV with more than a touch of Robocop about it. Built in a response to design a police car for 2025 the SUV would use a \"hydro-tech converter\" to turn water into hydrogen for its fuel cell power, emitting nothing more harmful than water vapor out of its exhaust pipes. LA's car show is about design and flash; Detroit is where the industry gets real. And it looks like even more muscle is going to be revealed next week. Ford is rumoured to have a redesigned F-150 in the pipeline, a half-ton behemoth that has been America's best-selling truck for decades and was last revamped in 2009, as well as all-new full-sized Transit vans. GM has its new Chevrolet Silverado and the GMC Sierra, best-sellers that were last redesigned in 2007. Analysts are expecting big launches from Chrysler and rivals including Toyota. \"Last several years, people who bought trucks were those who had to. Now I think they can make trucks cool again, bring back lifestyle purchasers,\" says Toprak, who used to run a Chevy and Chrysler dealership in the mid-1990s. \"Gas was less than a $1 a gallon,\" he says. \"Back then people would buy these things and never even use the trunk.\" All that changed with the recession and rising gas prices. Worst still, America's car manufacturers became dependent on sales of big cars to make ends meet. As consumers switched to leaner, smaller rivals, the already troubled industry spiraled into bankruptcy. Big cars still make more money for the car makers. GM is believed to make about $10,000 on each Silverado and Sierra it sells. But the balance of power has shifted away from big cars, and even their biggest fans doubt they will be as large a part of the business as they were before the crash. US consumers are expected to buy more than 15m vehicles in 2014 for the first time since 2007, a million more than this year, according to the National Automobile Dealers Association (Nada). It's a big bounce back from a low of 10.4m in 2009 but trucks and sports utility larger cars have so far lagged behind in the recovery, says Nada chief economist Paul Taylor. \"Everyone's pickups have got old in the recession. State and local governments, whose main income has been taxes from the housing market, they haven't been buying. Utility buyers haven't been buying. But that demand is starting to come back,\" he says. Light truck sales are up about 8.9% this year compared to 13.9% for all light vehicles. Small and mid-sized car sales have soared close to 25%. SUVs, once the hottest sellers on the block, were up just 5.1%. Taylor thinks there's still a lot of demand for the SUV out there, but that gas prices will have to come down before people trade up. \"I'm buying gas at $2.97. You give me gas at $2.40 and you can bet the industry will sell a lot of SUVs very quickly,\" says Taylor. Pickup trucks were 14% of the industry a few years ago, says Tom Libby, lead analyst at Polk. \"Right now they are 10 or 11%,\" he says. Launching new bigger cars will mean more to come as manufacturers use those same platforms to build new models, he says. But he's not expecting big cars to dominate the landscape in the way they once did. \"There's a lot going on throughout the industry,\" he says.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Once the Office for National Statistics said it wanted to have a long hard look at the retail prices index to see if it was fit for purpose there were really only three possible options. The first was to say that there was no problem and that therefore the status quo should apply. The second was to say that there was a problem and that the RPI should be replaced by something more robust. The third was the British way: admit that the RPI is frankly useless but continue using it anyway. No prizes for guessing which option the ONS and the Treasury have come up with. In a sense, the fudge is not just explicable but sensible. Had the ONS cited methodological problems as the reason for changing the way the RPI was calculated (as it could have done) , pensioners would have kicked up an almighty fuss. Why? Because inflation as measured by the RPI has been consistently higher than inflation measured by the consumer prices index (by around a percentage point) and using the CPI as a yardstick for calculating interest rates on government bonds would have meant smaller pensions. Far better from the ONS's perspective to say it is happy enough to continue calculating the RPI on the old basis, despite its acknowledged flaws \u2013 and allow George Osborne to decide whether to continue using it. The Treasury has decided it will, even though analysts at Capital Economics have calculated that it will cost the Treasury \u00a37bn in higher interest payments by 2016-17. For a government counting every penny, this is a considerable financial loss. On the other hand, pensioners vote in their millions and with an election little more than two years away, ministers \u2013 and the ONS \u2013 were clearly not keen to fight a prolonged and bitter political battle with one of the country's most powerful lobbying groups.",
