      "bodyText": "Unilever is to go head-to-head with its arch consumer goods rival Procter &amp; Gamble in the male shaving market after buying Dollar Shave Club for an estimated $1bn (\u00a3759m). P&amp;G owns Gillette, which dominates the global shaving market and accounts for around 60% of sales in North America. However, Dollar Shave Club has shaken up the market through an online subscription model and a viral marketing campaign. It sends grooming products to customers for as little as $1 a month. Dollar Shave Club\u2019s adverts involve Michael Dubin, the founder, enthusiastically and comically speaking straight to camera to promote its products. Its first advert, released in March 2012, has been viewed more than 22m times online. In it, Dubin describes the company\u2019s razors as \u201cfucking great\u201d and claims that customers are paying high prices for branded razors just to fund celebrity endorsements and technology they did not need. \u201cDo you like spending $20 a month on brand-name razors? Nineteen go to Roger Federer,\u201d he says. \u201cDo you think your razor needs a vibrating handle, a flashlight, a back scratcher and 10 blades? Your handsome-ass grandfather had one blade \u2013 and polio. So stop forgetting to buy your blades every month and start deciding where you are going to stack all those dollar bills I\u2019m saving you.\u201d In four years, Dollar Shave Club has grown to 3.2 million members and generated sales of $152m in 2015. It has also attracted the ire of P&amp;G, which launched a rival Gillette shave club and is suing Dollar Shave Club for allegedly using patented razor technology without permission. The deal with Unilever, which owns Lynx, will allow Dollar Shave Club to expand outside the US and potentially take more market share from Gillette. Kees Kruythoff, president of Unilever North America, said: \u201cDollar Shave Club is an innovative and disruptive male grooming brand with incredibly deep connections to its diverse and highly engaged consumers.\u201d Dubin, who is still chief executive of Dollar Shave Club, said he was \u201cexcited\u201d by the deal. He said: \u201cDSC couldn\u2019t be happier to have the world\u2019s most innovative and progressive consumer-product company in our corner. We have long admired Unilever\u2019s purpose-driven business leadership and its category expertise is unmatched.\u201d Dubin, a former television producer, said he founded Dollar Shave Club because customers were frustrated with the dominance of Gillette. \u201cThey have been a dominant player for so long, but they\u2019ve also created a lot of animosity,\u201d Dubin told the Guardian last year. \u201cWhat we\u2019re doing is helping guys find the products they want in a really easy way, in an affordable way, and hold their hand as they make these grooming decisions.\u201d Dollar Shave Club also sells personal washing products, hair-styling items, and wet wipes called One Wipe Charlies. \u201cI get stopped in airports, people thanking me that we have this product,\u201d Dubin says about One Wipe Charlies. \u201cWe\u2019re riding a wave that\u2019s growing culturally. It\u2019s very much OK for you to talk to your friends about grooming. We talk to our members about the things that you do in private, like wipe your butt.\u201d Shares in Unilever rose 0.1% after it announced the deal. The company, which also owns Dove soap and Magnum ice cream, is due to publish its financial results on Thursday. Paul Polman, chief executive of Unilever, will be quizzed about the company\u2019s plans for Dollar Shave Club, but also about the potential impact of Brexit. Earlier this year, Polman insisted that Unilever\u2019s 7,500 staff in the UK would not be affected if Britain voted to leave the European Union. \u201cThe effectiveness of my research centre is the quality of the people I have there and the ideas coming out in terms of the innovations that we produce. We don\u2019t make a decision on moving research centres around depending on if you are in the EU or not,\u201d he said.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "A senior HSBC banker has been arrested by the FBI as he attempted to board a transatlantic flight and charged him with fraudulently rigging a multibillion-dollar currency exchange deal. Mark Johnson, a British citizen and HSBC\u2019s global head of foreign exchange trading, and a colleague are accused of \u201cdefrauding clients\u201d and alleged to have \u201ccorruptly manipulated the foreign exchange market to benefit themselves and their bank\u201d. He was arrested on Tuesday night shortly before he was due to fly to London from New York\u2019s JFK airport, and was due to be formally charged by a judge at Brooklyn federal court later on Wednesday. He was later released on bail. A second Briton, Stuart Scott, who was HSBC\u2019s European head of foreign exchange trading in London until December 2014, is accused of the same crimes. A warrant was issued for Scott\u2019s arrest. They are the first people to be charged in connection with the US government\u2019s long-running investigation into bankers\u2019 alleged rigging of the $5.3tn (\u00a34tn) per day forex market. \u201cThe defendants allegedly betrayed their client\u2019s confidence, and corruptly manipulated the foreign exchange market to benefit themselves and their bank,\u201d said the US assistant attorney general Leslie Caldwell. \u201cThis case demonstrates the [US Department of Justice\u2019s] criminal division\u2019s commitment to hold corporate executives, including at the world\u2019s largest and most sophisticated institutions, responsible for their crimes.\u201d Johnson, 50, who lives in both London and New York, and Scott, 43, who lives in London, are alleged to have \u201cplaced personal profits ahead of their duties of trust and confidentiality owed to their client, and in doing so, defrauded their client of millions of dollars\u201d. The men are accused of making $3m profit by fraudulently trading currencies in advance of a client buying $3.4bn of pounds sterling in 2011, according to the complaint. They are accused of buying sterling in advance of the client\u2019s transaction in a manner \u201cdesigned to spike the price\u201d to the benefit of HSBC \u201cand at the expense of their client\u201d. They also billed their client for $5m in fees for their work. Johnson and Scott are accused of weaving a \u201cweb of lies\u201d when the client questioned them about the higher price they were forced to pay to bring back proceeds from an overseas transaction to the UK. \u201cWhen questioned by their client about the higher price paid for their significant transaction, the defendants wove a web of lies designed to conceal the truth and divert attention away from their fraudulent trades,\u201d said the US attorney Robert Capers. \u201cThe charges and arrest announced today reflect our steadfast commitment to hold accountable corporate executives and licensed professionals who use their positions to fraudulently enrich themselves.\u201d Paul Abbate, the FBI\u2019s top official in Washington, said: \u201cThese individuals are accused of defrauding clients by misusing confidential information to manipulate currency prices for the benefit of the bank and themselves. The FBI will continue to work aggressively with our partners to prevent, investigate and prosecute criminal fraud in the financial markets.\u201d Rob Sherman, a spokesman for HSBC, said: \u201cHSBC has been and continues to cooperate with the DOJ\u2019s FX investigation.\u201d The justice department is conducting a criminal investigation into some global banks\u2019 alleged currency manipulation, and more than two dozen traders have been suspended by their employers. Last year, four banks pleaded guilty to conspiracy to rig the forex market and fines totalling $5.6bn were handed down to six banks. HSBC was not included in the settlement deal. The banks who agreed the settlement - Barclays, Royal Bank of Scotland, Citigroup and JP Morgan Chase - described themselves as \u201cthe Cartel\u201d and used secret chatrooms and coded language to manipulate benchmark exchange rates to make huge profits. The FBI said the scheme was criminal \u201con a massive scale\u201d. According to transcripts of the chatroom, published by the New York department of financial services (DFS), one Barclays trader in 2010 wrote: \u201cIf you aint cheating, you aint trying.\u201d Last year, the UK Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) fined five banks \u00a31.1bn \u2013 the biggest penalty in the history of the City of London \u2013 for failing to stop their traders manipulating the market. \u201cToday\u2019s record fines mark the gravity of the failings we found, and firms need to take responsibility for putting it right,\u201d the FCA CEO, Martin Wheatley, said at the time. In March, the UK Serious Fraud Office said that after reviewing more than half a million documents, it had concluded there was insufficient evidence for a realistic prospect of conviction. At the time, the fraud-busting agency said it was continuing to liaise with the US Department of Justice over its investigation, which had involved help from a number of regulatory bodies, including the FCA and the Competition and Markets Authority, as well as the City of London police. The SFO had not identified the firms or individuals it had investigated. It was revealed earlier this month that George Osborne, the former chancellor, intervened to persuade the US government not to pursue criminal charges against HSBC for allowing terrorists and Mexican drug dealers to launder millions of dollars. A congressional report published letters and emails from Osborne and Financial Services Authority (FSA) officials to their US counterparts warning that launching criminal action against HSBC in 2012 could have sparked a \u201cfinancial calamity\u201d. The House financial services committee report said the UK interventions \u201cplayed a significant role in ultimately persuading the DoJ [Department of Justice] not to prosecute HSBC\u201d. Instead of pursuing a prosecution, the bank agreed to pay a record $1.92bn (\u00a31.4bn) fine.",

At the time, the fraud-busting agency said it was continuing to liaise with the US Department of Justice over its investigation, which had involved help from a number of regulatory bodies, including the<br>FCA and the Competition and Markets Authority, as well as the City of London police.</p> <p>The SFO had not identified the firms or individuals it had investigated.</p> <p>It was revealed earlier this month that George Osborne, the former chancellor, intervened to persuade the US government not to pursue criminal charges against HSBC for allowing terrorists and Mexican drug dealers to launder millions of dollars. </p> <p>A <a href=\"http://financialservices.house.gov/uploadedfiles/07072016_oi_tbtj_sr.pdf\">congressional report</a> published letters and emails from Osborne and Financial Services Authority (FSA) officials to their US counterparts warning that launching criminal action against HSBC in 2012 could have sparked a \u201cfinancial calamity\u201d.</p> <p>The House financial services committee report said the UK interventions \u201cplayed a significant role in ultimately persuading the DoJ [Department of Justice] not to prosecute HSBC\u201d. Instead of pursuing a prosecution, the bank agreed to pay <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/dec/11/hsbc-fine-prosecution-money-laundering\">a record $1.92bn (\u00a31.4bn) fine</a>.</p>",

A full report will arrive on Friday and the MPs\u2019 verdict will be measured but probably not calm: expect stinging criticisms of how Sports Direct has treated its workers. As Ashley will also have suspected at the time, HM Revenue &amp; Customs could widen its inquiry into whether workers were paid less than the minimum wage. HMRC, as we report, is indeed examining claims by staff in Sports Direct\u2019s shops that they were forced to work beyond the hours for which they were paid. Concerns had previously been confined to the company\u2019s Shirebrook warehouse. If it all feels overwhelming for Ashley, he should remember that the situation is entirely of his own making. He had plenty of warning that a crisis was coming. The Unite union had been bemoaning gulag conditions at Shirebrook for years. Channel 4\u2019s Dispatches investigation aired in April last year. The company\u2019s annual meeting in September last year was mobbed by protesters. This paper\u2019s undercover investigation was published last December. That, finally, prompted Ashley to take a look at the complaints himself. But it was only after a dig from the MPs that he promised to send them his findings by this September and to recruit some outside expertise in the form a law firm. Progress, then, has been excruciatingly slow. But perhaps we should not be surprised. On Ashley\u2019s own account, Sports Direct probably outgrew his ability to manage it a long time ago.

Ashley owns 55% of Sports Direct and so cannot be compelled by the other shareholders to do anything. But a strong recommendation from MPs to install some proper boardroom checks and balances would be hard to dismiss. Let\u2019s hope the committee calls for exactly that.

Unilever hopes Dollar Shave Club will prove a cut above If Unilever is to make a success of its $1bn punt on Dollar Shave Club it will have to learn not to lather its new acquisition with corporate twaddle. Compare and contrast. Mike Dubin, founder of Dollar Shave, flogs his razors with the use of comedy online videos and the strapline \u201cthey\u2019re fucking great\u201d. Unilever thinks it is buying an \u201cempowering lifestyle brand\u201d that \u201cbrings to Unilever\u2019s personal care category a unique male grooming perspective\u201d. Much more of that leaden language and they will kill Dollar Shave in its infancy. Still, one assumes Unilever\u2019s marketing department understands the point. If so, this adventure is worth undertaking, even if the financial terms are only great from Dubin\u2019s point of view. The reputed $1bn is for a company that is merely \u201con track\u201d to achieve sales this year of $200m and whose profits are not disclosed, perhaps because they are tiny. Yet Dubin has been able to frighten Procter &amp; Gamble, owner of Gillette. His pitch is simple: razors ought to be simple and cheap; gimmicks such as vibrating handles have only been added to make the marketing men rich. Whether Dollar Shave\u2019s customers actually end up spending less on razors is open to question but there\u2019s no doubting the force of Dubin\u2019s videos. His four-year-old firm has grabbed a large slice of the US market for home-delivered razors. Gillette will not be knocked off its perch easily. But Unilever, aiming to assemble a cabinet of shaving products, has bought an intriguing business. It has either overpaid for a fad or acquired a brand that will seriously irritate P&amp;G, its main rival.

The US confectionery giant previously known as Kraft, which bought Cadbury in 2010, is in talks with Burton\u2019s Biscuits, the Birmingham-based business which has the right to make Cadbury Fingers and Cadbury Animals in perpetuity under a deal signed in 1986. Mondel\u0113z, which owns including Oreo, Ritz crackers and Belvita, had long wanted to gain control of Cadbury\u2019s biscuit licence, according to an industry source. The two groups previously held talks two years ago when Burton\u2019s was looking to offload its Cadbury business to help smooth a deal to buy United Biscuits (UB), the owner of McVitie\u2019s. Those talks collapsed when UB was bought by Turkey\u2019s Y\u0131ld\u0131z for \u00a32bn in 2014. Talks between Mondel\u0113z and Burton\u2019s, which is majority owned by the Ontario Teacher\u2019s Pension Fund, are understood to have restarted in the past few months.

However, Burton\u2019s is unlikely to agree a deal with the US confectioner unless it can find a solution for the rest of its business \u2013 which includes Jammie Dodgers, Maryland cookies and Wagon Wheels. Mondel\u0113z and Burton\u2019s said they did not comment on speculation. A number of potential solutions have been looked at including buying Fox\u2019s biscuits to build scale or selling out to UB owner Y\u0131ld\u0131z.

      "bodyText": "An Uber driver who says he earned less than the minimum wage has told a tribunal about the \u201ctremendous pressure\u201d he was put under to work long hours and accept jobs, and the \u201crepercussions\u201d he faced from the company if he cancelled a pick-up. James Farrar, a driver with the firm since December 2014, said some months he had earned little more than \u00a35 an hour and that \u201cUber control me very, very carefully\u201d. He was speaking at an employment tribunal in London at which a group of Uber drivers are arguing they should be recognised officially as workers at the company. Lawyers working for the 19-member group are arguing that the terms and conditions of their work with the company mean they are not technically self-employed and should be entitled to a range of benefits that they currently do not receive. The taxi-hailing app has about 30,000 drivers in London, all of whom are designated as self-employed \u201cpartner drivers\u201d. Farrar said: \u201cWorking for Uber is my job. I do not run a private hire business. I do not have a service company. I do not advertise \u2018driving services\u2019, I have no one working for me, I have only one car licensed with TfL for private hire work and I only drive for Uber. \u201cI understand that Uber is arguing that I run my own business and that Uber is a customer of that business, but this in no way reflects the daily reality of my job. I am not sure what service Uber provides to me.\u201d In his witness statement, Farrar said drivers receive 80% of fares paid by passengers to Uber, with the rest going to the company as commission. \u201cIn reality, they pay me for the work I have done and keep 20% of what they have charged the customer \u2026 I have no ability to negotiate a different deal \u2013 I either have to accept Uber\u2019s terms or not work as an Uber driver.\u201d The case is being monitored by unions and lawyers representing other workers who are designated as self-employed by firms and as a result do not qualify for the rights given to staff. The growth of the so-called gig economy means thousands of workers are in this position, and on Tuesday the TUC called for a change in the law to protect them. Annie Powell, a solicitor at law firm Leigh Day, which is representing the drivers, said Uber\u2019s argument was that it was a technology company and that it did not provide a transport service to customers \u2013 it merely put them in touch with drivers. Uber\u2019s lawyer, David Reade, argued that the drivers had a choice about their work \u2013 there was nothing to stop Farrar working for more than one operator at the same time, and that he was free to turn off the Uber app. But Farrar said if he ignored more than two bookings sent on the app, he was logged out and put in a \u201cpenalty box\u201d, where he was unable to work for 10 minutes. Reade said this only happened if a driver missed three consecutive jobs. Farrar said there had been times when he had had to work many more hours than he should have. On one occasion he worked 91 hours in a week. Farrar also accused Uber of offering customers unrealistic arrival times. In a witness statement, Farrar said he had calculated his net earnings for August 2015, after expenses, at \u00a35.03 an hour. However, Uber claimed that, based on the total number of hours logged into the app, he had been paid \u00a313.77 on an average hourly basis. Reade said Farrar had picked a month in which he had logged on to the app for the longest period of time but cancelled or not accepted the highest number of jobs, thereby reducing his hourly pay. Farrar told the tribunal that the \u00a35.03 an hour would have been about \u00a33.70 an hour if it had not been for the \u201csurge surcharge\u201d \u2013 the higher prices Uber imposes when demand is high. However, Farrar also said: \u201cI like working for Uber, I want to continue working for Uber.\u201d The case is due to last until Tuesday, and a decision on whether Uber is acting unlawfully is unlikely to be given by the judge for several weeks.",

      "bodyText": "With Wall Street hitting new record highs, global markets were in relatively buoyant mood, as global jitters faded for the moment. Rising oil prices helped, following a reduction in US crude stocks last week, as did the continuing trend of better than expected US company results, with Microsoft and Morgan Stanley both pleasing investors. In the UK the FTSE 100 finished above 6700 for the first time since last August. Tony Cross, market analyst at Trustnet Direct said: Having come close for the last two days, London\u2019s FTSE-100 is finally finishing above the 6,700 level, with fresh record highs on Wall Street helping shape sentiment in the latter part of the session. Financial stocks are leading the charge with better than expected unemployment readings adding further weight to the idea that a rate cut may not be all that imminent, whilst it\u2019s the miners that are the day\u2019s laggards. Anglo American has followed Rio Tinto in posting some lacklustre numbers and this is casting a shadow over the sector as a whole. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished up 31.62 points or 0.47% at 6728.99 Germany\u2019s Dax added 1.61% to 10,142.01 France\u2019s Cac climbed 1.15% higher to 4379.76 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB rose 0.54% to 16,763.82 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended 1.06% better at 8575.5 In Greece, the Athens market added 1.06% to 569.74 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently 38 points or 0.21% higher. On that note, it\u2019s time to close for the evening. Thanks for all your comments and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow for, among other things, the latest meeting of the European Central Bank. Meanwhile UK prime minister Theresa May has flown to Berlin to meet German chancellor Angela Merkel, with Brexit very much on everyone\u2019s mind. For the latest developments, see our political live blog: No surprise really, but S&amp;P has cut Turkey\u2019s credit rating from BB+ to BB and its outlook from stable to negative following the recent coup attempt. The agency said it expected a period of heightened unpredictability which could constrain capital flowing into Turkey\u2019s economy. Oil prices continue to recover after the US Energy Information Administration reported a 2.3m barrel fall in crude inventories, and have moved back into positive territory for the day. West Texas Intermediate is now up 0.67% at $44.95 a barrel having fallen as low as $43.69. While the FTSE 100 has been regaining ground since the shock Brexit vote and is now sitting at an 11 month high, the more UK focused FTSE 250 has yet to recover the level it reached ahead of the June 23 vote. But the mid-cap index is getting there, and a rise of 1% to its current 17,080 leaves it only 250 points shy of its pre-referendum level. Investors appear to have been comforted by the fact that the worst predictions of disaster following a leave vote have yet to be realised, with even the IMF this week rowing back from its talk of a UK recession in the wake of Brexit. US crude stocks fell last week much in line with expectations, with a draw of 2.34m barrels compared to a forecast 2.1m. But gasoline stocks rose unexpectedly, compared to expectations of no change: So crude prices remain lower but recovering from their worst levels, with West Texas Intermediate now down 0.9%, while gasoline future have hit their lowest since early March. The consumer confidence figures, while not as bad as they could be, still show that Brexit could have an effect on EU economic activity, says economist Howard Archer at IHS Global Insight: While there are no details available, there can be little doubt that a second successive drop in Eurozone consumer confidence to a three-month low in July is largely the consequence of heightened concerns over the economic and political outlook following the UK\u2019s vote to leave the European Union. The June consumer confidence survey - which showed modest slippage - had been completed before the UK vote on 23 June. There may be an element of relief that July\u2019s drop in Eurozone consumer confidence was not greater and it may alleviate some of the deepest concerns about how much Eurozone growth will be negatively impacted by the Brexit vote. Nevertheless the clear dip in Eurozone consumer confidence in July reinforces belief that the Brexit vote will have some dampening impact on Eurozone economic activity - particularly as the consumer has been a key growth driver for the Eurozone, notably in the first quarter of this year. On the positive side, for now at least, the fundamentals still look pretty solid for consumers in the Eurozone with negligible inflation supporting purchasing power and labour markets significantly improved overall. Dennis de Jong, managing director at UFX.com, said these figures could mark the low point: Consumer confidence in the EU had already dropped in the lead up to the Brexit vote and, in the uncertain aftermath, it\u2019s no real surprise that the mood has worsened. In the UK, consumer confidence has actually come through robustly, which may be an indicator as to how the rest of EU consumers will respond. Suddenly the euro doesn\u2019t look so shaky next to the falling pound, so there\u2019s every chance we could be looking at a consumer confidence nadir in today\u2019s numbers.\u201d In the wake of the UK\u2019s vote to leave the EU, consumer confidence in the area fell sharply, new data shows. According to a flash estimate by the European Commission, consumer confidence in the EU as a whole dropped by \u201ca marked\u201d 1.8 points to -7.6 in July. This is the worst level for two years. In the eurozone, confidence fell by 0.7 points to -7.9, slightly better than the -8 figure expected by economists polled by Reuters. The June figure of -7.2 was revised up from the initial -7.3. Oil is on the slide again ahead of US inventory figures, with West Texas Intermediate down 1.8% at $43.84, a two month low. The fall reflects continuing strength in the US dollar as well as concerns about a supply glut. US markets continue to move ahead, as Microsoft and Morgan Stanley continue the trend of companies reporting better than expected results. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is up around 13 points or 0.06% at 18572 having earlier hit a new peak of 18618. The S&amp;P 500 opened up 0.26% and Nasdaq 0.48%. The world\u2019s largest companies saw their revenues fall last year for the first time since 2010, according to the latest Fortune Global 500 list. Total revenues dropped 11.5% to $27.6trn from $31.2trn in 2014, with profits down 11.2% to $1.48trn. Fortune says: There are plenty of reasons for the reversal. A slowdown in China\u2019s once-booming economy has affected companies worldwide. Growth in the U.S. and Europe remains modest at best. And sustained low oil prices have erased billions in sales for giant petroleum producers like Exxon Mobil, Royal Dutch Shell, and Sinopec. But one macroeconomic trend looms largest of all: the explosive comeback of the U.S. dollar and the wide-ranging impact of its renewed strength on global trade. The US had 134 companies on this year\u2019s list, the highest number of any country, followed by China with 103 and 52 from Japan. The US added 6 new companies from the previous year, China added 5, and Japan lost 2, says Fortune. Chinese, Japanese and the US companies together accounted for 58% of the list. China only had 19 companies a decade ago. Britain currently has 26 Fortune Global 500 companies with 17 of them based in London (before any impact from Brexit of course.) Walmart is top of the list, as it has been eleven times since 1995. Apple appears in the top ten for the first time: 1. Walmart Stores (U.S.) 2. State Grid (China) 3. China National Petroleum (China) 4. Sinopec Group (China) 5. Royal Dutch Shell (Netherlands) 6. Exxon Mobil (U.S.) 7. Volkswagen (Germany) 8. Toyota Motor (Japan) 9. Apple (U.S.) 10. BP (Britain) The full list and more details are here. Here\u2019s link to the Moody\u2019s report on UK banks (see 13.49): US markets are expected to open higher following better-than-expected results from Microsoft and Morgan Stanley: Moody\u2019s has downgraded its outlook for the UK banking system to negative from stable because of the Brexit vote. Carlos Suarez Duarte, senior vice president at Moody\u2019s: Increased uncertainty about the UK\u2019s future trade relationship with the EU will likely lead to reduced confidence and lower investment and consumer spending in the UK. This will, in turn, pressure revenues, asset quality and profitability metrics for all banks in the UK, though some are more resilient to these pressures than others. Philip Hammond has had a dream start as chancellor according to Larry Elliott, the Guardian\u2019s economics editor: The Bank of England says there are no signs of a general slowing in activity. Consumers are still spending in the shops. The International Monetary Fund says the economy will slow sharply but will avoid a recession. It is still early days, of course. The full effects of the Brexit vote on the economy will only become apparent over months and years rather than in the four weeks that have so far passed since 23 June. As the Bank\u2019s agents made clear in their monthly report, many companies were so stunned by the result they have yet to work out what to do next. The IMF made a similar point in its updated World Economic Outlook. It noted that Brexit was still unfolding, which is obviously true. That said, Hammond has not had the baptism of fire that many predicted. Forecasts from the remain camp \u2013 of which the new chancellor was a member \u2013 came thick and fast in the run-up to the referendum. All of them warned of severe and immediate consequences if the leave side won. Read the full article here: Debbie Abrahams, Labour\u2019s shadow work and pensions secretary, has commented on the earlier labour market figures. She says wage growth remains too weak. (It was 2.3% in the three months to May, or 2.2% excluding bonuses.) It is welcome that there has been a fall in unemployment. However, under the Tories long term pay growth continues to be sluggish and our economy is over-reliant on low paid insecure work. If Theresa May is serious about supporting working people we need to see serious action on tackling low pay and investing in the high-skilled high-wage jobs our economy needs. MPs on the Business, Innovation and Skills Committee will publish their report on employment practices at Sports Direct on Friday... The Guardian understands the official investigation into Sports Direct\u2019s failure to pay its warehouse workers the national minimum wage has been widened to include the sportswear chain\u2019s 13,000 retail workers. Here is the full update from Simon Goodley: Returning to the labour market data, the number of people claiming jobless benefits rose by 400 in June to almost 760,000. It was far smaller than the 3,500 increase predicted by economists but the figure for May was heavily revised to show a 12,200 jump over the month, compared with the 400 fall the ONS previously estimated. As we move into afternoon trading European markets are up. Investors are cheered by evidence from the Bank of England that so far, the Brexit vote does not appear to have triggered a slowdown. Wolfgang Schaeuble, Germany\u2019s no nonsense finance minister, will meet the new UK chancellor Philip Hammond on Saturday on the sidelines of the G20 meeting in China. As well as bilateral talks between the two men, G20 finance ministers will discuss the aftermath of Brexit and how policymakers can ease concerns. The TUC has a different take on the unemployment report, arguing that it\u2019s not all good news. Specifically it points to the sharp rise in self-employment, which has increased by 300,000 people over the past year and now represents 15.1% of the workforce (4.8 million). TUC General Secretary Frances O\u2019Grady says: While it\u2019s good to see more people in work, the huge increase in self-employment raises questions about the nature of these jobs. These newly self-employed workers are not all budding entrepreneurs. Many don\u2019t choose self-employment, being forced onto contracts with fewer rights, less pay and no job security. We need more decent jobs. Not working conditions like those exposed at the courier firm Hermes these week, where workers were pushed on to self-employed contracts with fewer rights. Economists at Capital Economics still expect the Bank of England to inject fresh stimulus into the economy in August, despite the better-than-expected UK jobs figures. Paul Hollingsworth at Capital Economics: Despite the relatively upbeat assessment of the labour market overall, we still expect the Bank\u2019s Monetary Policy Committee to follow through with its (loose) commitment to ease policy at its next meeting on 4th August. After all, the vote to leave the EU will almost certainly now cause some firms to put hiring decisions on hold or cut back headcounts altogether. Indeed, we expect the unemployment rate to drift up over the coming quarters. He adds however that comments from the Bank\u2019s regional agents support his view that the short-term impact of the Brexit vote will be less severe than many think. Today\u2019s Bank of England agents\u2019 report showed that a majority of firms did not expect a near-term impact from the referendum outcome on their investment or hiring plans. Accordingly, for now we remain content with our view that the damage to the economy in the short term will be rather less severe than many others are anticipating. Not everyone agrees that the fallout from Brexit is limited so far. UK households think the outlook for their finances is the worst in two-and-a-half years following the decision to leave the UK. The indicator dropped to 47 in July from 49.3 in June according to Markit\u2019s latest survey. Anything below 50 signals a deterioration. People are also becoming more concerned about their jobs, Markit said. Philip Leake, economist at Markit: The survey suggests that the Brexit vote has badly affected households\u2019 views on their finances. With future prospects clouded by uncertainty, July data pointed to the worst financial outlook in two-and-a-half years. Household concerns also intensified as workplace activity fell for the first time since May 2012, with employers awaiting a clearer picture following the Brexit vote. The comments from the Bank of England agents - as well as the better-than expected employment data - are supporting the pound. It was down against the dollar before the two reports were published but is now up 0.6% at $1.3193. James Smith, economist at ING, says there may be trouble ahead, despite the upbeat tone struck by the Bank\u2019s agents: The latest update from the Bank of England\u2019s Agents suggests that there is little evidence of a knee-jerk reaction from businesses post-Brexit, but the medium/long-term outlook is more uncertain. The main message was that firms, for the time being, were seeking to maintain \u201cbusiness as usual\u201d and this suggests that it may be a while before we see any material Brexit impact show up in UK data. Further down the road, the outlook appears to be less certain. On investment, approximately a third expected some negative impact over the next 12 months, echoing the sentiment of recent surveys. There is \u201cno clear evidence\u201d that a UK slowdown is underway since the Brexit vote, according to the Bank of England\u2019s network of regional agents. Bank agents talk to businesses around the country to gain clues about how the economy is really doing, and the July report is the first since the 23 June referendum. The agents reported that while business uncertainty had \u201crisen markedly\u201d, there was little evidence that consumers were spending less. A majority of firms spoken with did not expect a near-term impact from the result on their investment or staff hiring plans. But around a third of contacts thought there would be some negative impact on those plans over the net 12 months. As yet there was no clear evidence of a sharp general slowing in activity. The jobs figures suggest employers were not rattled enough in the run-up to the EU referendum to freeze hiring or cut jobs on a major scale. The big question is whether that will change following the Brexit vote. The UK unemployment rate has fallen to 4.9% in the three months ending May, from 5%. The last time it was as low as that was 2005. These better-than-expected jobs figures are a gift to the new chancellor, Philip Hammond, who wasted no time commenting on them: Today\u2019s employment and wage figures are proof that the fundamentals of the British economy are strong. In the months before the referendum, employment in the UK reached a new record high, unemployment fell to its lowest in a decade and wages continued to rise. As the economy adjusts to the effect of the referendum decision, it is doing so from a position of economic strength. While the decision to leave the European Union marks the beginning of a new phase for our economy, the message we take to the world is this: our country remains open for business and we are the same outward-looking, globally-minded, big-thinking country we have always been. The pound rose back above $1.31 after better-than-expected figures from the UK jobs market. The headline figures: Unemployment rate falls unexpectedly to 4.9% in the three months ending May from 5%. It was the lowest since 2005. The number of people out of work falls by 54,000 to 1.65m. People claiming jobless benefits rises by a much smaller than expected 400 to 759,100 Employment rises by 176,000 to 31.7m Record employment rate of 74.4% Earnings increase by 2.3%, as expected The Bank of England will shortly publish its agents\u2019 summary of business conditions for July. It will provide the first snapshot of how businesses around the UK have responded to Britain\u2019s decision to leave the EU following the 23 June referendum. Figures published later today are expected to show consumer confidence weakened in the eurozone in July, following the Brexit vote. The \u2018flash\u2019 indicator from the European Commission is expected to fall to -8 from -7.3 in June. Nintendo has lost some of the gains made since the release of its hugely successful Pokemon Go game. Shares were down almost 15% at one point on Wednesday following reports the release of the game might be delayed in Japan. Nintendo\u2019s market value had doubled since the launch of the game - which combines the virtual world with the real one - earlier this month. Asian markets were mixed on Wednesday. Nikkei: -0.3% at 16,682 Hang Seng: +0.9% at 21,857 The FTSE 100 is up 19 points or 0.3% at 6,716 in early trading. The FTSE 250 is roughly flat at 16,902. Most other major European markets are up. Germany\u2019s DAX: +0.5% at 10,027 France\u2019s CAC: +0.4% at 4,348 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB: -0.1% at 16,660 Spain\u2019s IBEX: +0.4% at 8,515 The pound has dipped below $1.31. It is currently down 0.2% at $1.3085. The euro is down against both the pound and the dollar. It is down 0.3% against the pound at 83.93p, and hit a two-and-a-half-week low against the dollar of $1.0985. The dollar is rising partly on the back of expectations that the Fed will raise interest rates before the end of 2016 following positive data from the US economy (including jobs and the housing market). Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. At 9.30 the Office for National Statistics will publish latest figures from the UK jobs market. The figures are expected to show the number of people claiming unemployment benefit rose by 3,500 in June, following a drop of 400 in May. The headline unemployment rate will cover the three months to the end of May and is expected to be unchanged at 5%. Wage growth including bonuses is expected to pick up to 2.3% from 2%. Excluding bonuses growth is expected to be unchanged at 2.3%. The figures should provide some clues about how confident employers were feeling in the run-up to the 23 June referendum. Any shock to the downside would undoubtedly trigger a few alarm bells about the outlook for UK jobs in the aftermath of the Brexit vote.",

The June consumer confidence survey - which showed modest slippage - had been completed before the UK vote on 23 June.</p> <p>There may be an element of relief that July\u2019s drop in Eurozone consumer confidence was not greater and it may alleviate some of the deepest concerns about how much Eurozone growth will be negatively impacted by the Brexit vote.</p> <p>Nevertheless the clear dip in Eurozone consumer confidence in July reinforces belief that the Brexit vote will have some dampening impact on Eurozone economic activity - particularly as the consumer has been a key growth driver for the Eurozone, notably in the first quarter of this year.</p> <p>On the positive side, for now at least, the fundamentals still look pretty solid for consumers in the Eurozone with negligible inflation supporting purchasing power and labour markets significantly improved overall.</p> </blockquote> <p>Dennis de Jong, managing director at UFX.com, said these figures could mark the low point:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Consumer confidence in the EU had already dropped in the lead up to the Brexit vote and, in the uncertain aftermath, it\u2019s no real surprise that the mood has worsened.</p> <p>In the UK, consumer confidence has actually come through robustly, which may be an indicator as to how the rest of EU consumers will respond.</p> <p>Suddenly the euro doesn\u2019t look so shaky next to the falling pound, so there\u2019s every chance we could be looking at a consumer confidence nadir in today\u2019s numbers.\u201d</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-578f84f2e4b0378a304b1ec1\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-07-20T14:12:45.273Z\">3.12pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">European Union consumer confidence drops after Brexit</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>In the wake of the UK\u2019s vote to leave the EU, consumer confidence in the area fell sharply, new data shows.</p> <p>According to a flash estimate by the European Commission, consumer confidence in the EU as a whole dropped by \u201ca marked\u201d 1.8 points to -7.6 in July.

      "bodyText": "The new business secretary has held talks with Tata Steel UK bosses and trade unions at the Port Talbot steelworks in an attempt to resolve the crisis facing the industry. Union leaders said they were encouraged by the talks with Greg Clark, who has replaced Sajid Javid as the man tasked with protecting steelmaking in the UK. Approximately 11,000 jobs are at risk at Tata Steel after the Indian company threatened to withdraw from its UK operations. Tata Steel is working on a deal to keep its British business through a merger with German conglomerate ThyssenKrupp. However, the agreement depends on the government providing loans worth hundreds of millions of pounds and passing laws that will allow Tata Steel to restructure the British Steel pension scheme, which has liabilities of almost \u00a315bn. Tata Steel is concerned over whether Theresa May\u2019s government will still sign off these measures and is holding off from making a final decision on its UK business, which includes the blast furnaces at Port Talbot. However, Clark is thought to have reassured union leaders that protecting the steel industry remains a priority for the government. Roy Rickhuss, the general secretary of Community, the steelworkers\u2019 union, said Clark understood the pressure on the industry. \u201cI am encouraged that Greg Clark has met with steelworkers in his first week on the job. He will have left today in no doubt that Community will keep the pressure on this government to keep their promises to protect the steel industry,\u201d he said. \u201cThe new secretary of state clearly understands the scale of the challenge still facing the industry, but his words to steelworkers today must be followed by firm actions to help save their jobs. By visiting Port Talbot, he will have seen first hand that the highly skilled workforce is the foundation on which any success for this industry will be built.\u201d Unions and business leaders have previously welcomed the government\u2019s pledge to draw up an industrial strategy for Britain. This suggests that ministers are willing to step in and protect strategic industries. The term \u201cindustrial strategy\u201d has been added to Clark\u2019s department, which has been given responsibility for Britain\u2019s energy policies. His full title is secretary of state for business, energy and industrial strategy. A spokesman for Tata Steel said: \u201cWe were pleased to welcome the new secretary of state to the Port Talbot steelworks to see, first hand, world-class steelmaking as it happens. \u201cThe visit follows Monday\u2019s welcome comments from the prime minister that helping the steel industry secure a long-term viable future remains a top priority for her government. \u201cWe look forward to working urgently with the new secretary of state, alongside other stakeholders, to develop the best outcome for our UK business and its employees, as well as others including members of the British Steel pension scheme.\u201d",

    "webTitle": "Eurotunnel slashes earnings target by \u20ac25m after Brexit vote", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Eurotunnel has cut its annual earnings target by \u20ac25m (\u00a321m) because of the collapse in the value of the pound after the Brexit vote. The cross-Channel rail operator warned that further downward movements in the UK currency would hit its finances even harder, while it reported that Eurostar passenger traffic was down 3% over the last quarter. But the Paris-based company insisted the British vote to leave the EU should not damage its long-term growth prospects and it said profits rose 4% to \u20ac249m in the first half of 2016. \u201cMonth after month, Eurotunnel has broken traffic records, particularly for the truck shuttles. The tunnel has never been as highly utilised as it is today,\u201d said Jacques Gounon, chief executive of Eurotunnel. \u201cDespite the financial market uncertainty generated by the United Kingdom voting to leave the European Union, the group remains confident in the performance of its economic model and in its outlook.\u201d Eurotunnel said its full-year earnings target of \u20ac560m, based on an exchange rate of \u20ac1.375 to the pound, had been cut to \u20ac535m, based on a currency exchange reduction to \u20ac1.273. The pound has fallen below \u20ac1.19, meaning Eurotunnel may have to cut its targets further if there is no change on the currency markets. The decline in Eurostar traffic was attributed to terrorist attacks in Brussels and industrial action in France. Wizz Air said it would increase UK capacity by 15% during the second half of the year, rather than the 30% it originally intended.

      "bodyText": "A supreme court ruling could prompt a wave of fraudulent claims on household and car policies after it ruled it was acceptable to tell a \u201ccollateral lie\u201d when making a claim. Until now, insurers could reject any claim in its entirety if they found evidence of lies \u2013 such as a motorist claiming to be a librarian rather than a sportsman to keep their premiums low. But the ruling means that so-called collateral lies \u2013 which are demonstrably false but do not affect the overall value of a claim \u2013 may have to be overlooked by insurers and cannot be used to dismiss a claim. For example, a person who fabricates a lost receipt for, say, a stolen bicycle \u2013 but the value claimed is what was actually paid \u2013 is likely to win their case even if the receipt is later proved to be false. But a householder who claims a \u00a31,000 Prada handbag was stolen during a burglary when it was actually a \u00a360 bag from M&amp;S could still see the entire claim thrown out. In the example of the car driver, the picture is less clear as that may still be ruled out as \u201capplication fraud\u201d. Consumer groups said the ruling would prevent insurers from declining a claim on a technicality. Kevin Pratt, consumer affairs expert at Moneysupermarket, said: \u201cThe landmark judgment by the supreme court overturns centuries of insurance practice \u2013 and is great news for honest insurance customers. It\u2019s not a cheat\u2019s charter, and it\u2019s not a blank cheque for would-be fraudsters. But it does mean that insurers will not be able to throw out perfectly valid claims on little more than a technicality.\u201d The Association of British Insurers said it would study the implications of the judgment. Its director, James Dalton, said: \u201cInsurers are in the business of paying all genuine claims and have a duty to their honest customers to investigate suspected fraudulent claims. \u201cNo insurer will decline any claim on the grounds of fraud unless they believe they have good grounds to do so. But as this judgment makes clear, inflating the value of an otherwise genuine claim still remains fraud.\u201d The supreme court judgment follows a lengthy legal battle and numerous appeals. The precise case, Versloot Dredging v HDI Gerling, had nothing to do with household or car insurance, but has implications across the industry. It involved a Dutch cargo ship, which made a claim for $3.2m (\u00a32.4m) after its engine room flooded. The claim was rejected after it was revealed that the crew lied about the cause of the flooding. This amounted to a \u201cfraudulent device\u201d, which the court said invalidated the claim. The ruling was upheld in the court of appeal, but overturned by the supreme court. One of the judges, Lord Mance, said: \u201cThe critical point is that, in the case of a collateral lie \u2026 the insured is trying to obtain no more than the law regards as his entitlement, and the lie is irrelevant to the existence of that entitlement. Such a lie is immaterial to the claim.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Almost nine in 10 new UK jobs created in the past three months were for people who were self-employed, raising fresh concerns about the erosion of employees\u2019 rights amid the rise of the so-called gig economy. Of the 118,000 full-time jobs added in the most recent three-month period, 104,000, or 88%, are self-employed, according to figures from the Office for National Statistics. Almost one in six, or 15.1%, of all UK workers are self-employed. The boom in jobs classed as self-employed helped push unemployment down to its lowest in more than a decade. There were 31.7 million people in work in the three months to the end of May \u2013 176,000 more than for the three months to February 2016. The TUC said the increase in self-employment was not driven by a boom in entrepreneurship; instead workers were increasingly forced by employers to accept precarious employment with low pay. Questions about the growth in self-employed workers have been highlighted by the legal case brought by Uber drivers against the taxi-hailing phone app. At a tribunal that began in London on Wednesday, a group of Uber drivers argued they were not technically self-employed and should qualify for benefits that accrue to employees. The growth and impact of the informal gig economy were also demonstrated by the case of Hermes, where 10,500 couriers working for the parcel delivery company are self-employed. The perfectly legal arrangement means they are not entitled to the national living wage, pension contributions, or holiday or sick pay. Frances O\u2019Grady, general secretary of the TUC, said: \u201cWhile it\u2019s good to see more people in work, the huge increase in self-employment raises questions about the nature of these jobs. \u201cThese newly self-employed workers are not all budding entrepreneurs. Many don\u2019t choose self-employment, being forced on to contracts with fewer rights, less pay and no job security. \u201cWe need more decent jobs. Not working conditions like those exposed at the Hermes, where workers were pushed on to self-employed contracts with fewer rights.\u201d O\u2019Grady said the government should invest in housebuilding and infrastructure projects such as the HS2 rail link to create secure full-time jobs and apprenticeships paying decent wages. In a report two years ago, the ONS said record levels of self-employment were caused by fewer people leaving self-employment and more people choosing to work for themselves after the state pension age of 65. But the economy\u2019s reliance on self-employed jobs has increased concerns about a growing \u201cprecariat\u201d of workers in uncertain employment with few rights, as power has shifted from labour to employers following the worst recession since the great depression of the 1930s.",

      "bodyText": "SportsDirect.com \u2013 the UK\u2019s number one, or so they would have you believe. Does that mean number one employers? Certainly not. As a casual sales assistant (or \u201cCast\u201d), I am employed on a zero-hour contract basis. By definition, this means that I am not guaranteed to be offered work, although equally I am not obliged to accept any hours offered. In reality, however, it doesn\u2019t work like that at all at Sports Direct. If you are given hours, you are expected to work them or find cover for your shift. You are told that refusal to do so could lead to being sacked. The zero-hour contract also means that hours can be hugely inconsistent. In the past I have been offered just three to four hours work a week, over a period lasting more than a month, before suddenly being given more than 20 hours the following week. It has been argued that the structure of a zero-hour contract allows for greater flexibility for students, but the reality of the matter is that many young workers are exploited due to their low wage costs and the fear that turning down work might result in them being sacked or given reduced hours. This fear factor is ingrained into the whole culture of Sports Direct. There is constant pressure from managers to sell bags and magazines if you are operating tills \u2013 or to sell insoles if you are working in the shoes department. If you do not meet the target, then this is classed as a fail for the day and often a stern lecture from the managers. While this doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that the managers are bad people, the culture of fear, pressure and unrealistic expectations have become the norm across the company. It is also extremely intimidating for zero-hour workers, who often feel unable to question managers and you frequently feel that staff who are liked more by the management are given more hours, regardless of their actual ability. There is then the threat of the strike system. Sports Direct\u2019s Shirebrook warehouse operates a \u201csix strikes and you\u2019re out\u201d policy where you can be fired for accumulating black marks for offences such as a \u201cperiod of reported sickness\u201d, \u201cerrors\u201d or \u201cexcessive/long toilet breaks\u201d. In the shops, I was informed in an early shift that it would be just three strikes before dismissal. In an early shift I was threatened with a strike after failing to sell insoles. I was told it was a contractual requirement, despite there being no mention of either the strike system or the obligation to sell insoles within the contract itself. Another part of the culture at stores includes the promotion of in-house Sports Direct brands such as Karrimor, Dunlop and Lonsdale. While this may be expected, it often feels like we are being forced to mislead customers by being instructed to \u201cupsell\u201d customers from other brands such as Adidas and Nike to Sports Direct equivalents. Our commission scheme means that you mostly only receive money on the Sports Direct brands. It may be an effective way to encourage the home-brand promotion, but it often results in exaggerated claims or at times, outright lies. This lack of professionalism extends to the overall atmosphere within the workplace, which is demonstrated by the differing treatment of people and the general attitudes and priorities of managers. The relationship between sales assistant and manager has a tendency to be one of fear rather than respect, and this of course has a detrimental effect on the morale and efficiency of workers. No matter how hard we may be working, we still face harsh criticism and constant pressure from managers when their targets are not met. Praise is extremely rare. This imbalance in the relationship between staff and managers is also reflected in the lack of certainty in finishing time, particularly during \u201cclosedown\u201d shifts where everyone is required to tidy, clean and stock up the shop floor once it is shut. While we may be given a certain finish time on our rotas, this is never adhered to and we can end up working for over an hour after this time. You fear that any refusal to do so may lead to being sacked. It\u2019s unclear as to whether we are paid for every minute worked here, as pay slips merely state a block of hours. Yet one of the key issues and most disheartening matters for workers is the attitude of Mike Ashley, who repeatedly distances himself from current problems in the stores. He claimed that a review into working practices would never be complete. However, it is tough to see evidence of any progress. And the issues that he claims to have solved? They\u2019re still there. For example, he stated that docking 15 minutes\u2019 pay for being a minute late to work was \u201cunacceptable\u201d and that it had been amended. However, this threat of pay deduction is actually written into my contract and is still in enforcement. The requirement for shop workers to undergo a search after clocking out remains another issue, as they are forced to remain on site without being paid for their time. A regular complaint from customers is that workers haven\u2019t been trained properly and this is true. While you will undergo an induction to work at Sports Direct, there is a lack of thorough training for most staff members who are instead expected to learn mostly from experience. This is extremely challenging, particularly for the many people for whom this is their first job and leads to a general lack of efficiency. Often, there have been situations where I was scoffed at by senior staff for not knowing vital pieces of information \u2013 things that I was simply expected to know but never actually told. However, the fellow casual workers are all generally helpful, generous and friendly people who are in the same boat. When first starting the job this is absolutely vital as the tips and advice from colleagues have to make up for the lack of training. Mike Ashley\u2019s letter to the Guardian Ashley told the Guardian that he was not aware of workers being told that they can be sacked if they do not work the hours their manager gives to them, or that Sports Direct\u2019s shop staff have a contract which threatens to deduct pay for arriving late. He denied that: there is a fear factor ingrained into the whole culture of Sports Direct; that some shop workers are told they can be dismissed for three misdemeanours; that workers sometimes feel under pressure to mislead customers and the commission scheme only incentivises them to sell Sports Direct brands; that finish times on rotas are not adhered to; that there is inadequate training and that the company has been paying shop workers less than the legal minimum.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The official investigation into Sports Direct\u2019s failure to pay its warehouse workers the national minimum wage is understood to have been widened to include the sportswear chain\u2019s 13,000 retail workers. In a development that could significantly increase the scope of potential fines and back-pay due, the Guardian understands that investigators from HM Revenue &amp; Customs are examining if Sports Direct retail staff \u2013 as well as about 3,000 warehouse workers at the group\u2019s headquarters in Shirebrook, Derbyshire \u2013 have been paid less than the legal minimum. The news comes after the chain\u2019s billionaire founder, Mike Ashley, told a parliamentary inquiry in June that the company had broken the law by failing to pay warehouse staff the minimum wage. The admission confirmed the findings of a Guardian investigation last year in which undercover reporters exposed how the company\u2019s warehouse workers were receiving less than the legal rates after harsh financial deductions for clocking in slightly late and being forced to go through unpaid searches at the end of each shift. Ashley also told MPs, who will publish their report on Friday, that the company is being investigated by HMRC over the breach. The Guardian has since spoken to past and present Sports Direct shop workers who have described similar practices taking place in the company\u2019s stores for several years. One Sports Direct shop worker, who said he has reported the retailer to HMRC for not paying the minimum wage, said: \u201cThere have been times when they tell us to clock out and then we have to work for an hour or two without pay. You do tasks like cleaning the floor, cleaning the toilet and kitchen and then lastly the security check, but we have already clocked out so we were not getting paid. This happened not only one time but multiple times.\u201d Another retail worker, who was asked if it was routine to be required to work unpaid after a shift had finished, replied: \u201cProbably every bloody shift.\u201d A current retail employee added: \u201cThis imbalance in the relationship between staff and managers is also reflected in the lack of certainty in finishing time, particularly during \u2018closedown\u2019 shifts where everyone is required to tidy, clean and stock up the shop floor once it is shut. \u201cWhile we may be given a certain finish time on our rotas, this is never adhered to and we can end up working for over an hour after this time. You fear that any refusal to do so may lead to being sacked. It\u2019s unclear as to whether we are paid for every minute worked here, as pay slips merely state a block of hours.\u201d The testimonies about working practices in Sports Direct stores appear to mirror those discovered in the Shirebrook depot by Guardian undercover reporters. There, all warehouse workers were kept onsite at the end of each shift to undergo a compulsory, unpaid search by Sports Direct security staff, which typically added another hour and 15 minutes to the working week. Workers were also docked 15 minutes of pay for being one minute late, while if they worked late they were not paid for the extra time. The practices contributed to many staff being paid an effective rate of about \u00a36.50 an hour, as opposed to the then statutory rate of \u00a36.70, which potentially saved the firm millions of pounds a year at the expense of some of the poorest workers in the UK. An employment contract, seen by the Guardian and issued to a Sports Direct shop worker starting his role earlier this year, states: \u201cIf you scan into work late, the system will automatically deduct 10 minutes from your day\u2019s working time, which may affect how much you are paid.\u201d Former workers also said this practice had been in place for years. In a letter to the Guardian, Ashley said he \u201cstrongly disputed\u201d that Sports Direct pays less than the legal minimum wage and added: \u201cOur policy is to pay our people above national minimum wage. Provide details so that I can investigate.\u201d On the retail contract, which threatens to dock pay for lateness, he added: \u201cPlease send me the contract you refer to so that I can investigate.\u201d \u201cI can tell you categorically is that it is my belief that no person should ever be fearful in the workplace,\u201d he said. \u201cIt has always been my intention that Sports Direct should be a great employer that handsomely rewards people at all levels.\u201d The Guardian understands that HMRC\u2019s investigation into Sports Direct includes the retail side of the business, not only because the government agency is compelled to investigate after receiving a worker complaint to its hotline, but also as a matter of course when it has begun an inquiry into another part of the business. A HMRC spokesperson said: \u201cWhile we don\u2019t discuss individual cases, we always investigate businesses where we believe the national minimum wage [NMW] is not being paid. We act on information from a range of sources, including workers, third parties or from our own proactive intelligence work. \u201cHMRC will look at every complaint made by a worker through the Acas helpline.\u201d Jeni Morris, a former HMRC minimum wage investigator and founder of a consultancy firm NMW Direct, said: \u201cThe current investigation into Sports Direct will definitely include all the shops, as the retail sector are amongst the most non-compliant of businesses with regard to national minimum wage and national living wage issues. \u201cThe retail sector usually pays at, or very close to the minimum rates and pays for the hours which the staff are contracted to work. However, you cannot leave a customer at the checkout as it\u2019s 6pm and your rota states you finish at 6. Invariably workers will stay until the last customer is served and vacated the shop, some workers then have to cash up and close the stores. All of this extra time should be paid for.\u201d The latest issues at Sports Direct come as concerns rise that businesses are finding increasingly innovative ways to lower wage bills for low-paid workers. This week a separate Guardian investigation showed how the delivery firm Hermes is paying some of its couriers at levels equivalent to below the national living wage because they are self-employed.",

We act on information from a range of sources, including workers, third parties or from our own proactive intelligence work.</p> <p> \u201cHMRC will look at every complaint made by a worker through the Acas helpline.\u201d</p> <p>Jeni Morris, a former HMRC minimum wage investigator and founder of a consultancy firm NMW Direct, said: \u201cThe current investigation into Sports Direct will definitely include all the shops, as the retail sector are amongst the most non-compliant of businesses with regard to national minimum wage and national living wage issues.</p> <p>\u201cThe retail sector usually pays at, or very close to the minimum rates and pays for the hours which the staff are contracted to work. However, you cannot leave a customer at the checkout as it\u2019s 6pm and your rota states you finish at 6. Invariably workers will stay until the last customer is served and vacated the shop, some workers then have to cash up and close the stores. All of this extra time should be paid for.\u201d</p> <p>The latest issues at Sports Direct come as concerns rise that businesses are finding increasingly innovative ways to lower wage bills for low-paid workers.</p> <p>This week a separate Guardian investigation showed how the delivery firm <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/jul/18/hermes-couriers-paying-staff-less-than-living-wage\">Hermes is paying some of its couriers at levels equivalent to below the national living wage</a> because they are self-employed. </p>",

      "bodyText": "Philip Hammond has had a dream start as chancellor of the exchequer. Unemployment is down. The Bank of England says there are no signs of a general slowing in activity. Consumers are still spending in the shops. The International Monetary Fund says the economy will slow sharply but will avoid a recession. It is still early days, of course. The full effects of the Brexit vote on the economy will only become apparent over months and years rather than in the four weeks that have so far passed since 23 June. As the Bank\u2019s agents made clear in their monthly report, many companies were so stunned by the result they have yet to work out what to do next. \u201cUncertainty had risen and many felt there was a lack of information on which to base major decisions and that information might only become available with a considerable lag as future trading relations became clearer,\u201d they said. The IMF made a similar point in its updated World Economic Outlook. It noted that Brexit was still unfolding, which is obviously true. That said, Hammond has not had the baptism of fire that many predicted. Forecasts from the remain camp \u2013 of which the new chancellor was a member \u2013 came thick and fast in the run-up to the referendum. All of them warned of severe and immediate consequences if the leave side won. Yet, the economy has not come to a grinding halt, which is perhaps unsurprising given that many of those who voted for Brexit did not believe forecasts made by the Treasury, the OECD and the IMF. Events since the referendum suggest the scepticism was well-founded. The Treasury has canned plans for an emergency budget and there has been considerable backtracking by the IMF on the doom it predicted for the UK (and the wider global economy) in the event of Brexit. That prompted Michael Pearce of Capital Economics to say that the Fund was bluffing all along. To be sure, the Fund cut its 2017 growth forecast for the UK by 0.9 percentage points. But this would be a relatively modest revision given the magnitude of the referendum. It doesn\u2019t remotely compare to the cost of the great recession, when growth of 2.5% in 2007 was followed by contractions of 0.4% in 2008 and 4.5% in 2009. It is worth repeating: these are still early days. There is a possibility that the economy will gradually lose momentum over the next 12-18 months as companies decide not to go ahead with expansion plans or move production overseas. The latest unemployment figures were strong, but some labour market experts think they are not quite as good as they look. Labour market specialist, John Philpott, director of the Jobs Economist consultancy, said: \u201cOn the face of things it might be said that the UK jobs market defied concerns about pre-Brexit vote jitters, with employment up a very hefty 176,000 in the spring quarter and the jobless rate falling to 4.9%. Bonus payments even gave a welcome boost to average weekly pay packets. \u201cBut one doesn\u2019t have to dig too deep for signs that employers did become more cautious in the run-up to the referendum. Self-employment accounts for two-thirds of the total quarterly rise in employment while vacancies for employee jobs flat-lined and growth in average weekly regular pay (ie excluding bonuses) dipped a little. \u201cThese stats thus paint a confusing picture of the state of the UK jobs market prior to the Brexit vote and it would be unwise to draw upon the strong headline figures as evidence that the shock of Brexit on jobs will prove to be mild.\u201d But only in its wildest dreams could the government have expected the initial post-Brexit-vote world to be so benign. There is plenty of uncertainty but no panic. Sterling has stabilised and share prices are rising. Theresa May and her ministers have the breathing space to work out how they are going to engineer Brexit. Clearly this is the beginning and not the end of the story.

But another boost to its share price has come from Microsoft\u2019s fourth quarter results, released overnight, with the US group saying its cloud business had seen \u201csignificant customer momentum .\u201d That prompted positive comments from Panmure Gordon analyst George O\u2019Connor on the prospects for Sage\u2019s business, and helped send the company\u2019s shares up 16.5p at 693p, making it the biggest riser in the FTSE 100.

    "webTitle": "ARM workers set to share nearly \u00a3400m if SoftBank deal goes through", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Workers at ARM Holdings, Britain\u2019s biggest technology company, could share a payout worth almost \u00a3400m if Japanese group SoftBank completes its takeover attempt. Small print in SoftBank\u2019s offer for ARM shows that 22.4m outstanding share awards have been granted in employee incentive schemes at the British company. Given that SoftBanks\u2019s bid is priced at \u00a317 per share, this means that ARM employees could share as much as \u00a3380m, although the timing of the payout is likely to be spread out and could be used to encourage talented engineers to stay at the company. ARM employs 1,600 people in Cambridge, where its headquarters is located, and about 4,000 worldwide. Some of the biggest share awards would be made to executives at ARM, who are also part of separate incentive schemes. Simon Segars, chief executive, could collect \u00a311m, while Mike Muller, the chief technology officer, is in line for \u00a321m. The potential payout for employees was first reported by the Times (paywall). The \u00a324.3bn takeover of ARM Holdings could yet be in doubt after investors in SoftBank gave it the thumbs down. Shares in SoftBank fell by more than 10% in Japan on Tuesday as investors and analysts expressed concerns about the price of the deal and the increasing debt of the telecoms and tech group. The acquisition of ARM would be the biggest deal yet for SoftBank and its charismatic founder, Masayoshi Son, but SoftBank already has $113bn (\u00a386bn) of debt. \u201cA fresh acquisition is not what the market wants from SoftBank,\u201d Mitsushige Akino, the chief fund manager at Ichiyoshi Asset Management, told Reuters. \u201cIt\u2019s Mr Son\u2019s style to keep expanding, but isn\u2019t he stretching too much?\u201d Hermann Hauser, who helped to found ARM in 1990, said that SoftBank\u2019s debt mountain meant that some of the money earned by ARM could be used to pay interest or reduce debt, rather than be invested back in the company. \u201cIf [ARM were] allowed to remain independent, all that cash could be ploughed into further development, now some of it will have to be spent on servicing debt,\u201d Hauser said. Son dismissed concerns from SoftBank shareholders at a press conference in London on Monday. \u201cIf the investors do not like it, they will sell,\u201d he said. \u201cI am the largest shareholder in SoftBank.

      "bodyText": "Theresa May\u2019s new administration has received a significant boost from a Bank of England report showing that the economy has been resilient in the first few weeks since the Brexit vote and displays no general signs of slowing down. The monthly survey by the Bank\u2019s regional agents \u2013 considered to be the \u201ceyes and ears\u201d of policymakers in Threadneedle Street \u2013 found that a majority of firms questioned were not planning to mothball investment or change hiring plans. Even so, City analysts said the Bank was still likely to announce fresh stimulus measures for the economy next month in anticipation that the better-than-expected economic news since the referendum would not last. Howard Archer, chief UK economist at IHS Global Insight, said: \u201cWhile there may be some relief that the economy may have dodged an immediate sharp slowdown from the Brexit vote, the danger is still very much there given the major uncertainty that is apparent \u2013 and there seems a compelling case for the Bank of England to deliver a substantial package of measures at its August meeting to try and bolster business and consumer confidence\u201d The agents\u2019 report was released at the same time as the Office for National Statistics reported that the labour market remained solid in the period from March to May, the first three months of the referendum campaign, with the jobless rate falling to its lowest level in more than a decade. The chancellor, Philip Hammond, said the figures were \u201cproof that the fundamentals of the British economy are strong\u201d. He added: \u201cAs the economy adjusts to the effect of the referendum decision, it is doing so from a position of economic strength.\u201d The Bank of England said its agents had stepped up their investigations in the wake of the Brexit vote to find out how businesses were reacting. It found that for many companies the result had come as a shock, but with few having contingency plans, the tendency had been to adopt a \u201cbusiness as usual\u201d approach. \u201cThe outlook for investment was uncertain,\u201d the report said. \u201cThe majority of firms spoken with did not expect a near-term impact from the referendum result on their capital spending. But around one third expected some negative effects over the next twelve months, with reports of a \u2018risk off\u2019 approach to expenditures and some imminent plans for spending slipping.\u201d The agents found that there had been a dip in housing market activity after 23 June but that transactions had so far proved to be more resilient than some contacts had expected. \u201cThere had been little evidence of any impact on consumer spending on services and non-durable goods, although there were some reports of consumers becoming more hesitant around purchases of higher-value goods.\u201d The Bank\u2019s findings were backed up by the latest trading report from the retailer John Lewis. It said spending in its department stores and at its Waitrose supermarkets were 3.2% higher in the week ending 16 July than they had been in the same week of 2015. The pound rose on the foreign exchanges after the Bank\u2019s agents report and the unemployment figures were released. It closed two thirds of a cent higher at just below $1.32. According to the ONS, there were 31.7 million people in work in the three months ending in May, 176,000 more than for the three months to February 2016 and 624,000 more than for a year earlier. The government\u2019s preferred measure of unemployment, the internationally agreed measure that looks at those without a job but seeking and available to work, fell by 54,000 in the three months ending in May to its lowest level since early 2008, when the economy was in the early stages of recession. The ONS said the unemployment rate had edged down from 5% to 4.9% and was last lower in the July to September period of 2005.",

The sector continued to subside as commodity prices ease as a consequence of the stronger dollar, the US currency being boosted by a growing expectation that a Federal Reserve rate rise is not off the agenda. But there are some specific issues. Anglo American has fallen 50.4p to 763.2p after it lowered its full year production guidance for iron ore and copper. Similarly, BHP Billiton is down 24.2p at 924.3p after its iron ore production guidance for 2016 came in 3m tonnes short following a disaster at its half-owned Samarco business, where a dam burst in early November. But Fresnillo has edged up 1p to \u00a318.78 as it lifted its forecast for full year gold production from 775,000-790,000 earlier to 850,000-870,000. Overall the FTSE 100 is up 27.11 points at 6724.48, heading for a new 11 month high, as UK unemployment came in slightly better than expected and the Bank of England said there was no clear evidence of a post-Brexit slowdown. Among the risers HSBC has added 8.4p to 495.5p after UBS raised their target price from 450p to 535p. The bank also helped lift car insurer Admiral 30p to \u00a320.75 after moving its recommendation from neutral to buy: UK car insurers have been the best performing sub-sector in 2016, re-rating due to defensive characteristics, yield attractions and a rising rate environment. We now expect greater appreciation of the growth opportunity, ultimately driving near term earnings surprises and further multiple expansion. As we have seen at our recent Disruptive Innovation conference, we think that some nimble and innovative insurers can begin to reposition as far more customer-centric product providers. Hikma Pharmaceuticals is 35p higher at \u00a325.86, as its US subsidiary launched generic equivalents for a range of cancer treatments.

Wizz Air is up 56p at \u00a315.99 as the budget airline, which is focused on Eastern Europe, said it was confident of meeting its full year net profit forecast. But it said it would cut its UK growth plans after the Brexit vote and the weakness in the pound, and redeploy planes elsewhere. An upbeat trading statement has lifted Electrocomponents 20.2p to 278.6p.
