Previous IMF interventions have drawn an angry response from leave campaigners who have already said the fund should not interfere in the UK\u2019s democratic process. The leave camp has also attacked its record on economic forecasting.

The IMF, which has warned of a slowdown in the global economy, urged British policymakers to be on alert for economic shocks and even raised the prospect of a UK interest rate cut.

The warnings about a substantial blow to economic growth follow an impassioned plea from the IMF\u2019s managing director Christine Lagarde on Friday for Britain to remain in the EU. In a speech in Vienna, Lagarde warned of a worrying rise in economic nationalism that threatened the union and urged policymakers to do more to reduce the inequality that made some Europeans \u201cfeel left behind\u201d. The fund\u2019s latest comments on a possible Brexit echoed the Bank of England\u2019s warning on Thursday that leaving the EU would risk pushing the pound sharply lower and sending shockwaves through the global economy.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Sir Philip Green decided to sell BHS because of the expense of rescuing its pension fund, according to evidence released by a parliamentary inquiry on Friday. Chris Martin, the chairman of the BHS pension fund trustees, said in notes on a meeting with Green\u2019s advisers that the billionaire had decided to put the business on the market in early 2015 primarily because the Project Thor rescue scheme was considered too expensive \u201cbut also personal factors which have convinced him that now is the correct time to sell\u201d. Green sold BHS for \u00a31 in March 2015 to Dominic Chappell, who has gone bankrupt three times. The department store collapsed into administration just 13 months later, putting 11,000 jobs at risk and leaving a \u00a3571m pension deficit. At the time of the sale, Green had spent months negotiating the bailout deal with Martin and the other trustees, according to the evidence. He was also fending off requests from the pensions regulator for a report relating to \u201cmoral hazard\u201d, the circumstances under which assets had been taken out of the business under Green\u2019s stewardship. Negotiations over Project Thor were paused in September 2014 when Green and his advisers suggested putting \u00a350m in cash into the pension scheme and Martin said he felt it needed about \u00a3100m. Negotiations were paused just after the pensions regulator had asked Green for details of dividends paid out of BHS, management charges paid to Green\u2019s parent company, property transactions and rental payments. In a meeting on 2 February, just over a month before Green sold BHS to Chappell, Paul Budge, the finance director of Green\u2019s retail business Arcadia, and Neville Kahn, a partner at Deloitte, told Martin that Green was unlikely to agree to take part in the pension regulator\u2019s long-requested moral hazard review unless he was compelled to do so. Green told MPs this week that Arcadia had only a handful of meetings with the former pension fund trustee chair Margaret Downes, and that the trustees had not sought a deal to fix the deficit in the scheme before 2012. A series of emails released by MPs, however, indicate that from 2008 Downes repeatedly pressed the company to increase its contributions but was told that it could not pay more than \u00a36.5m a year. The notes also indicate that as late as 2 February, just weeks before the sale to Chappell\u2019s Retail Acquisitions, there were two potential bidders for BHS and Chappell was chosen as frontrunner. They also show that Green claimed that he had personally finalised the deal with Chappell. In Martin\u2019s notes from a call with Green on 12 March he quotes Green saying he had \u201cput the ball in the net on his own without 27 advisers\u201d. Green told MPs he \u201cone million per cent\u201d would not have dealt with Chappell if he had not been cleared by Goldman Sachs, who advised the tycoon about the sale of BHS for free. Green said he stood by his testimony given to the parliamentary select committee in which he said that the decision to sell BHS was based on its continuing losses and the fact that Arcadia decided it could no longer afford to fund them. Arcadia issued interest-free loans of \u00a3256m to BHS, writing off \u00a3200m of loans when it sold the business. Green also pointed to evidence given to the committee that he had been working to find a solution to the BHS pensions issue throughout. He has promised to \u201csort\u201d the pension problems at the retailer. \u201cWe didn\u2019t run away,\u201d he told MPs. The new documents published by MPs also provide details about how Retail Acquisitions took \u00a317m out of BHS, with Chappell\u2019s consortium taking a cut from property and financing deals. Mike Ashley, the owner of Sports Direct, wrote in a letter to MPs that he thought he had agreed a rescue deal for BHS with the administrators. He confirmed that Sports Direct was in talks with Chappell about buying BHS just days before it collapsed into administration in April, and then again with administrators after it failed. He said there were two major obstacles to a deal with Chappell, securing consent from the pensions protection fund and pensions regulator, and Arcadia giving up its claim over BHS\u2019s assets, which it held through a \u00a335m loan to the department store chain. Ashley said: \u201cThe BHS pensions scheme was discussed and it is my understanding that a call was made to the pensions protection fund, but we were unable to reach a satisfactory agreement in the time available. \u201cThe deal did not proceed because we were placed under extreme time pressure and for the reasons set out above.\u201d Ashley, who also revealed that he explored buying BHS from Green in 2006 and 2007, said Sports Direct tried to revive the deal after administrators were called in. \u201cOur proposal would have potentially saved the vast majority of the jobs and stores at BHS and we felt that this should be taken into account when making a decision as to whether or not our bid was accepted,\u201d he said. He said he met administrators and Green on 27 April, when he thought a deal had been struck to save BHS. \u201cOur understanding when we left the meeting was that we had an agreed deal, which was to be executed on Friday 13 May 2016. Following the meeting an SPA [Sale and Purchase Agreement] was sent out by DLA [the law firm] on behalf of Duff &amp; Phelps, which was duly returned within 48 hours. However, as you know, the deal did not happen.\u201d",

Green told MPs he was a \u201cbig boy\u201d who did not tell lies and did not want to shift the blame for the demise of BHS, which he owned for 15 years until selling it in March 2015 for \u00a31. His evidence, however, has raised further questions about the collapse of the department store chain, and MPs expressed surprise at the tycoon\u2019s responses to come questions. Frank Field, the chair of the joint committee, said at one stage: \u201cIt is just slightly surprising for me and maybe others, Sir Philip, that everybody who has come has said you are this great figure, a Napoleon figure, and I am slightly shocked in that you are telling us you are not this figure. All these people got it wrong. You didn\u2019t really make all the big decisions.\u201d Here are five key points from Green\u2019s evidence that MPs are now likely to seek more detail about: The Sports Direct rescue deal Dominic Chappell, who bought BHS from Green, has accused the tycoon of blocking a rescue deal with Mike Ashley\u2019s Sports Direct. Green told MPs he was not aware that Sports Direct was interested in buying BHS when Chappell began talks with Ashley on 21 April, but Iain Wright, the chair of the business, innovation and skills committee, produced a letter from Ashley confirming that he had spoken to Green over the following days. This made Green uncomfortable, but he still insisted that he had \u201czero involvement\u201d in the talks. It remains unclear why Sports Direct, which was clearly interested in BHS, could not agree a deal and why it was not given enough time to continue talks. Green produced a chequebook for MPs to indicate that Sports Direct was not willing to pay enough for BHS, but the committee was unable to question him further because he accused the MPs of being \u201creally rude\u201d for suggesting his ego might have been a reason for him to block the deal. The appointment of administrators Chappell has accused Green of pushing BHS into administration by calling in \u00a335m of debt that Arcadia was owed. Green brought a letter from the administrators to dispute this allegation and the claim he blocked the Sports Direct deal. His letter from Duff &amp; Phelps said that Neville Kahn, a partner at Deloitte, had contacted the firm first about becoming administrators. Wright, however, produced a different letter from Duff &amp; Phelps that said Green had contacted them first. \u201cThat contradicts what you have just said to us, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d Wright said. Green and Arcadia, as BHS\u2019s biggest secured creditor, had a legal right to call in administrators, particularly after BHS management told him at a board meeting that its finances were \u201cnot fit for purpose\u201d. Green said that Chappell and BHS management had agreed the appointment of administrators, but MPs have heard conflicting accounts of the week before BHS collapsed. The sale of a BHS shop to Green\u2019s stepson Brett Palos bought a BHS shop in Ealing for \u00a36.9m just days before Green sold the company to Chappell\u2019s consortium, Retail Acquisitions. Chappell said he was shocked to find out who had bought the shop and that Green had to inform the pensions regulator that the deal had been done with a related party. Green, however, told MPs he had no involvement in the deal, a regular response during his six-hour hearing, and did not know whether the pensions regulator had asked him about related party transactions. \u201cWhy am I going to lie? It\u2019s sold. It got paid for. It\u2019s ridiculous,\u201d an increasingly agitated Green told the Conservative MP Richard Graham. The MPs are likely to push for more evidence and documents surrounding the sale of the shop. Moving to Monaco Green told MPs he left the UK in 1998 because of a heart scare and \u201cfor personal reasons.\u201d He said he did not own \u201cany businesses at all\u201d when they left. Asked why he chose Monaco in particular on health grounds, Green told the committee that \u201csomebody suggested it\u201d and it was partly to do with schools for his children. The Greens left for Monaco early in 1998, just months before Tina Green collected nearly \u00a338m from the sale of a 13% stake in Sports Division, a retail chain taken over by now-defunct sportswear chain JJB Sports. At the time, Green also owned the Shoe Express chain, which he bought in December 1997. He sold it May 1998 for a \u00a320m profit. Pausing Project Thor Green told MPs the main reason he decided to pause discussions on a bailout plan for BHS\u2019s pension fund, known as Project Thor, in September 2014 was that he \u201cfelt it was the wrong moment to be going to the suppliers or the landlords\u201d for a contribution. He said he had not been influenced at all by the fact that the pensions regulator had raised the question of \u201cmoral hazard\u201d, powers under which it can demand contributions towards a pension deficit from a company\u2019s owner or former owner. Emails to Chris Martin, the chair of the BHS pension fund trustees, state that the company\u2019s decision to pause Project Thor came after a call with the pension regulator and that this was \u201cclearly a factor\u201d. The regulator had made clear on 4 September that it was looking into moral hazard and wanted more information on dividends paid out by BHS going back to 2000, management charges paid by the company to Green\u2019s parent company, property transactions and rental payments. Green told MPs he could not remember the exact date when it was decided to pause Project Thor, but MPs said they had evidence to show it was 5 September, the next day.",

      "bodyText": "The UK stock market ended a choppy week on a stronger note, rebounding from a four-month low as traders nervously shuffled their positions in the final days before the EU referendum. Risk aversion continued to pervade UK and global markets over the week, with figures showing more than $1bn (\u00a3700m) was pulled out of UK equity funds, the second biggest outflow over the past decade. Trading has been marked by investors seeking out safer assets such as gold and government bonds and dumping riskier shares. But with campaigning for the EU referendum suspended after the death of MP Jo Cox, investors were in a calmer mood on Friday. The FTSE 100 index of leading shares closed up 1.2% on the day at 6021.09. Earlier in the week, the index had dipped below the 6,000 mark for the first time since February. But Friday\u2019s rebound meant it was down just 1.5% over the week. Banking stocks were among the top risers on the London market, Lloyds shares were up 6% and Barclays rose more than 4% as worries about the referendum resulting in a vote to leave receded slightly. Housebuilders, another group considered particularly vulnerable in the event of Brexit, also rallied on Friday. \u201cThe fears surrounding a Brexit have abated somewhat today,\u201d said Joshua Mahony, market analyst at online trading company IG. He said a pickup in oil prices also helped the FTSE, with Brent crude up 3.2% $48.71 a barrel at the time of the London stock market close. \u201cThe incessant rise in crude prices today has provided enough emphasis to keep the main UK benchmark afloat,\u201d added Mahony. But market players said the mood was still tense due to the backdrop of tight opinion polls on Thursday\u2019s referendum. This week, $1.1bn poured out of UK equity funds, while European equity funds also experienced big outflows as investors sought out safer assets, according to figures from Bank of America Merrill Lynch Global Research. Its strategists summed up the market mood in a research note: \u201cJune thus far has been all about the risk-off Brexit trade, ie long gold, US bonds, yen and short oil, UK/EU equities, British pound.\u201d The pound had another choppy week as the Bank of England said UK currency could fall sharply in the event of Brexit. That prediction and a lead for leave in the opinion polls helped push sterling to a 10-week low of $1.4013 on Thursday. But it recovered on Friday to $1.4313. Martin Beck, of the Oxford Economics consultancy, highlighted the correlation between the pound and opinion polls. He said: \u201cRecent movements in sterling have closely tracked shifts in opinion polls on the EU referendum. A rise in support for leave over the last week saw sterling drop by just over 1% on a trade-weighted basis,\u201d he said, referring to sterling when measured against a basket of other major currencies. In a sign of nervousness about what is expected to be a tight vote, the cost of hedging against wild swings in the pound over the next week hit a record high on Friday.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Senior managers at EDF have told MPs that they remain convinced that the French state-controlled group should postpone the Hinkley Point project until it has solved a litany of problems, including the reactor design and multibillion-euro lawsuits over delays on similar schemes. The letter from EDF managers to the UK parliament\u2019s energy and climate change committee is the latest setback for the proposed \u00a318bn nuclear plant, a flagship government energy policy that is intended to provide 7% of Britain\u2019s electricity from about 2025, at a time when old coal and atomic plants are closing down. In April, the French company said it was delaying a final investment decision (FID) until September while it consulted with trade unions, but engineers and other middle managers appear to remain implacably opposed. A letter addressed to Angus MacNeil, the chairman of the committee, from the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Nationale des Cadres Sup\u00e9rieurs de l\u2019\u00c9nergie (FNCS) union \u201cadvises to delay the FID until better upfront industrial visibility is evidenced\u201d. Outstanding problems highlighted by the senior managers at EDF include: Areva NP, the designer of the European pressurised reactor (EPR) planned for Somerset, \u201cis currently facing a difficult situation\u201d. The French nuclear safety authority (ASN) may not give the green light to the EPR being constructed at Flamanville in north-west France due to various anomalies. There may be \u201cidentical flaws\u201d in an Areva EPR being built at Taishan 1 in China. The scandal over falsification of parts from Areva\u2019s Le Creusot that potentially put safety checks at risk. Multibillion-euro litigation between Areva and the Finnish energy group TVO over delays to an EPR scheme at Olkiluoto remains unsettled. An EDF offer to purchase Areva expired on 31 March, leaving \u201cgovernance uncertainties upon the implementation of the Hinkley Point C project\u201d. Many of the problems have been raised by other unions inside EDF, such as the CGT, which are worried that EDF\u2019s soaring debts and growing financial commitments are a danger to its future stability. But the letter from Norbert Tangy, the president of the FNCS, to MacNeil highlights once again the huge list of problems. Among others is concern expressed by the ASN at a hearing on 25 May that any resolution of EDF and Areva\u2019s twin financial problems could take considerable time. The energy and climate change committee is investigating the financing of new nuclear plants and has twice called Vincent de Rivaz, the chief executive of EDF\u2019s British subsidiary, EDF Energy, to explain the delays at Hinkley. Earlier this week, Areva said it was splitting itself into three parts and isolating the financial commitments to its much-delayed and over-budget EPR project in Finland. Areva previously held a 10% equity stake in Hinkley, but this was relinquished last year, and the project is now owned by EDF and its Chinese partner, China General Nuclear Power Corporation. A spokeswoman for Areva, asked about the latest internal restructuring, was unable to say exactly when EDF will take over the Areva NP arm of the business, which oversees reactor designs. EDF Energy declined to comment on the letter to MacNeil, saying it would not be appropriate while a consultation of staff was under way. But De Rivaz told the committee in May: \u201cThe current position of some of the French trade unions is to postpone the project for two to three years. Our position is that there is no need for a delay because the project is ready.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "After another torrid week, European markets ended on a high note. Investors were in calmer mood as the prospect of Brexit appeared to fade a little, with the mood helped by the suspension of the campaigning by both sides for a while. Banks and housebuilders, which had fallen sharply in recent days on concerns about the effect of the UK leaving the UK, were among the biggest risers. But Wall Street was weaker, with Apple down on worries about its sales in China. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 added 1.19% or 70.61 points to 6021.09 Germany\u2019s Dax rose 0.85% to 9631.36 France\u2019s Cac closed up 0.98% at 4193.83 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB jumped 3.49% to 16,923.29 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended 1.98% higher at 8362.0 In Greece, the Athens market added 5.4% to 586.55 after an agreement to release the latest tranche of bailout cash But on Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 81 points or 0.46%. Meanwhile sterling rose from Thursday\u2019s lows of $1.4010, and is currently sitting at $1.4318. On that note it\u2019s time to close for the evening. Thanks for your comments, and we\u2019ll be back next week for what promises to be a crucial few days. Europe has to find a new way to build trust between member states and the people, European Central Bank president Mario Draghi has said. In a speech in Munich in honour of former German finance minister Theodor Waigel, he said: Today we face a choice \u2013 between leaving things as they are and moving forward. And this is not a choice without costs. We have seen that the price of inaction is high. We have seen how it leaves the economy vulnerable to instability. We have seen how the perceived impotence of public authorities in meeting the needs of their people feeds into frustration and rejection. And we have seen how that risks undermining trust in and support for our institutions \u2013 and even the European Union itself... We have to find.. a way that builds on existing institutions to better ensure that the common needs of the people are met. The needs that we share in common, and that can be more safely delivered in common, must be identified and explained more clearly. They include economic interests, such as the benefits provided by a large and fully integrated financial area. They include defence, and more generally security against internal and external threats, the capacity to address global migration challenges and the protection of intellectual property \u2013 all of which the European Union helps deliver, in ways that individual governments may not necessarily be able to do. And they include environmental protection and the fight against climate change. It is the demonstration of why, and how, those interests can be better protected in common that will gradually complement compliance and convergence as the basis for trust and the cement of the Union. European markets are holding onto their gains as we head into the close, but Wall Street has fallen back. Recent Federal Reserve comments showing concern about the state of the global economy have not helped, nor has a drop in Apple\u2019s share price on worries about iPhone sales in China. Joshua Mahony, market analyst at IG, said: For once we are seeing market jitters emerge from the US markets today, as relatively solid session for the FTSE has been overshadowed by a sharp deterioration in US equities today. The fears surrounding a Brexit have abated somewhat today, with a break from the polls allowing for a more positive end to a very mixed up week for UK equities. Crucially, the incessant rise in crude prices today has provided enough emphasis to keep the main UK benchmark afloat. Today\u2019s ultra-dovish comments from the traditionally hawkish St. Louis Fed President Jim Bullard mark a significant shift in emphasis at the FOMC, with an indication we could only yet see one hike in the next 18 months. While there is no doubt that Fed confidence will have been knocked by this month\u2019s payrolls shocker, the accompaniment of a growth slowdown means that Janet Yellen\u2019s dream of a summer hike may turn into a dream of a 2017 hike. The uncertainty over the result of the UK referendum has seen investors pull out $1.1bn from UK equity funds in the past week, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch. This is the fastest pace for 13 months and the second largest outflow over the past decade, after the last general election. Donald Tusk, head of the European Council, has shared his meeting schedule for next week. Wonder what they\u2019ll find to talk about at 10.30 on Friday 24th? It\u2019s the calm before next week\u2019s probable storm in the markets, according to Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex. With European shares heading higher after the suspension of Brexit campaigning, Campbell said: Doing its best to dampen the day\u2019s rebound was the Dow Jones, the US index opening 20 to 40 points lower after the bell. There wasn\u2019t necessarily much to cause that decline bar a relatively weak pair of housing starts and building permits readings. Nevertheless the Dow sporadically dipped below 17700, perhaps playing catch up with the sharper declines seen across the week in Europe. Talking of Europe, while the Eurozone indices lost some of their lustre (the DAX now up by a reduced 0.7%) the FTSE held on its growth this afternoon, the UK index increasing by 1.1%. The pound, meanwhile, saw an even more surprising rise, with cable at points grazing $1.43 for the first time since the start of the week. Given their behaviour in the past few days the markets could be in for a real rough ride next week. The persistent polls likely to leak out in the run up to the referendum should leave the pound in a constant state of flux, while the FTSE may well see itself return to that 5900, 4 month low pretty quickly on Monday. However, while the potential post-Brexit reaction is clear, it will be interesting to see how much momentum the markets can gain if Britain opts to remain in the EU, an eventuality seemingly backed by the behaviour of Spreadex\u2019s clients. The result of the UK referendum could spark a spate of central bank intervention in the currency markets, including the Bank of England and potentially the Bank of Japan which has been worried about the strength of the yen anyway. But a Brexit is less of a risk than Grexit - if Greece left the eurozone - according to Alan Ruskin. strategist at Deutsche Bank. He said in a note to clients: The most likely scenario for the Bank of Japan to intervene and sell yen in the currency market, is if US dollar/Japanese yen threatened or breached Y100 following the UK referendum. Presumably, the Yen would also be registering even larger gains versus European currencies in such circumstances. In that situation, the Bank of Japan would likely intervene \u2018under the cover\u2019 of the UK referendum vote, by making a strong case to the US and G20, that i) Japan is being placed under unique duress from a dramatic tightening in financial conditions allied to the stronger yen; and, ii) that the exchange rate is reflective of volatile international events, and not domestic conditions. As for the Bank of England, any intervention was likely to be co-ordinated with the European Central Bank and the US Federal Reserve: Were sterling trading to become particularly unruly following the UK referendum (say Cable through 1.30 and continuing to drop) the Bank of England is unlikely to sit idly by. Were the Bank of Englan to intervene to support the pound, it would make sense to also have the ECB and Federal Reserve intervene on the Bank of England\u2019s behalf, as a signal of global solidarity. Only if events in the foreign exchange market were reflective of a global systemic event that might trigger a significant tightening in financial conditions in the the US, would the Fed intervene on its own book. Such a global systemic spillover is not expected. The precedent of a potential Grexit was far more threatening for financial markets than the UK referendum, if only because monetary unions promote huge financial flows premised on a fixed exchange rate/price, and there are large winners and losers when they unravel. Unraveling trade agreements, do not have the same immediate risk management implications that lead to self reinforcing financial dislocations. At the moment Cable - the sterling dollar rate - is at $1.4295. More on the comments from German finance minister Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble on Brexit. Reuters reports: Sch\u00e4ulbe said on Friday that Europe was trying to prepare for any possible outcome of Britain\u2019s referendum on whether to stay in the European Union. Speaking after a meeting of EU finance ministers in Luxembourg, Schaeuble also said Europe was well prepared to respond to current Brexit-related anxiety in financial market. His comments came after Chancellor Angela Merkel said on Thursday Britain would lose privileged access to the single European market if it leaves the European Union, in her strongest remarks yet on next week\u2019s referendum. Wall Street is down in early trading. Dow Jones: -0.1% at 17,716 S&amp;P 500: -0.1% at 2,076 Nasdaq: -0.3% at 4,832 According to Reuters, the German finance minister Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble says Germany is trying to prepare for all eventualities following the UK referendum on EU membership. He added: We think we are well prepared to respond to the current anxiety in financial markets. US housing starts dipped in May according to the Commerce Department. Privately-owned housing starts fell 0.3% to 1.164m from a downwardly revised 1.167m in April. Building permits rose however by 0.7% to 1.138m, suggesting the housing sector would continue to be a boost to the US economy. On both measures it was better than economists expected. Also this on BHS: The parliamentary committees investigating the demise of high street retailer BHS have published some more written evidence as part of the inquiry. Among the documents is a letter from Mike Ashley, the entrepreneur and founder of Sports Direct. In it, he outlines his version of events relating to his communication with former BHS owner Dominic Chappell and others over a possible rescue of the business. He suggests that Sports Direct looked twice at a potential rescue of BHS shortly before its collapse. Ashley claims that a proposed deal would have saved the vast majority of jobs and BHS stores: Following the announcement on 25 April 2016 that BHS was now in administration, Sports Direct contacted Duff &amp; Phelps with a view to putting together a second rescue package. A subsequent meeting took place at the offices of Arcadia on 27 April 2016. I attended this meeting in person along with my acquisition team. The other attendees included, amongst others, Sir Philip and Phil Duffy of Duff &amp; Phelps. Our proposal would have potentially saved the vast majority of the jobs and stores at BHS and we felt that this should be taken into account when making a decision as to whether or not our bid was accepted. Our understanding when we left the meeting was that we had an agreed deal, which was to be executed on Friday 13 May 2016. Following the meeting an SPA (Sale &amp; Purchase Agreement) was sent out by DLA on behalf of Duff &amp; Phelps, which was duly returned within 48 hours. However, as you know, the deal did not happen. Jonathan Loynes, chief European economist at Capital Economics, says a British vote to leave the EU would force the European Central Bank to act. European equity markets would be very likely to drop further and peripheral bond yields could rise further, raising the threat of a re-ignition of the [eurozone] debt crisis. Meanwhile, an appreciation of the euro against a declining pound would exacerbate any negative effect on exports to the UK. Against this background, the European Central Bank will come under strong pressure to provide further policy support... the Governing Council would surely err on the side of caution and take more action. A further acceleration in its monthly asset purchases would be likely and another cut in interest rates possible. The ECB may even engage, with other central banks, in FX intervention to limit disruption in the currency markets. Speaking of CNBC, it also has an interview with US Federal Reserve board member James Bullard, who said there should only be one rate hike before 2018. CNBC reports: St. Louis Fed President Jim Bullard, in a significant shift in his outlook for the U.S. economy, now says low growth and a very low fed funds rate of just 63 basis points will likely remain in place through 2018. Bullard, reversing earlier forecasts that looked for growth to pick up and rates to rise, now says 2 percent growth is the most likely forecast and that rates will remain low. Bullard also sees unemployment at 4.7 percent and trimmed-mean PCE inflation of 2 percent during this window. As a result, he says the Fed funds rates should remain at 63 basis points during the remainder of his forecast. The current target rate is 25 to 50 basis points. As a reminder, after the Fed raised rates in December there was talk of three or four further rises this year. Earlier this week the Fed held rates and made cautious comments about the risks to the global economy, not least the prospect of Brexit. More from IMF managing director Christine Lagarde. Speaking on CNBC she said there were significant benefits from the UK being in the European Union, and that Brexit was a concern not just for the UK but for the world. Brexit would hurt the UK more than the EU according to Italy\u2019s Prime Minister, Matteo Renzi (Reuters is quoting the Tass news agency in Russia). Of course it would be a problem but it would be a small problem for Europe and a much larger problem for Britain. He made the comments on the sidelines of the St Petersburg International Economic Forum. This follows his comments earlier in the month that a vote to leave the UK would be a \u201cdisaster\u201d for Britain. Brent crude oil is inching closer towards the $50 a barrel mark - currently up 2% at $48.12. Mihir Kapadia, chief executive of Sun Global Investments, has a view: Crude oil prices have risen today for the first time in a week, with global markets enjoying a respite from worries about the upcoming EU referendum. The anticlimactic return back below $50 per barrel for prices recently has taken the wind out of some traders\u2019 sails, after a light at the end of the tunnel in the form of $53 a barrel last week was met with a 5-day slide. The impressive recovery in oil prices from early February led to some guarded optimism that we may see oil back closer to the highs of 2014, but the ubiquitous uncertainty in global markets since then makes prediction more difficult than usual. For now, oil is back on the rise. The problem for the markets is: we have no idea how long that will last. US cosmetics company Revlon has agreed to buy Elizabeth Arden in an $870m (\u00a3611m) deal, which will bring together Revlon\u2019s hair colour products with its rival\u2019s anti-ageing creams and celebrity fragrances. The move will create a cosmetics giant with annual sales of $3bn. It comes less than six months after Revlon\u2019s main shareholder and chairman, the billionaire Ron Perelman, considered putting the company up for sale. The New York-based firm has been struggling under its heavy borrowings and the deal will help it refinance the debt. Elizabeth Arden is known for its luxury skincare products, especially anti-ageing ranges, such as Prevage, Ceramide and SuperStart. Its fragrances include those licensed from celebrities including Britney Spears, Justin Bieber and Taylor Swift. However, the popularity of celebrity fragrances has waned, with sales falling, while Elizabeth Arden\u2019s namesake brand has been performing better. Revlon was founded in 1932 by Charles Revson, his brother Joseph and a chemist, Charles Lachman, who contributed the L in the Revlon name. In the midst of the Great Depression, they started with a single product, a nail polish \u2013 the first opaque nail enamel (at the time the only shades available were pale and transparent). Called Cherries in the Snow, it was inspired by the scarlet-lipped, cigarette-smoking Hollywood actresses of their day and is still selling today. Revlon\u2019s other nail polishes had names such as Fatal Apple and Kissing Pink. Lipstick became the firm\u2019s next big item in 1940 and it launched an advertising campaign touting \u201cmatching lips and fingertips\u201d. Jasper Lawler, analysts at CMC Markets, has this take on the markets: Fear-based trades sent markets to extreme levels in a short space of time and they have snapped back. Gold soaring to two-month highs typified the level of market anxiety. It\u2019s sharp reversal has typified the sentiment reversal. The course-reversal across markets has seen everything that was doing badly, do the best and everything that was doing poorly, outperform. That means banks, particularly debt-laden peripheral European and Brexit-exposed UK banks are ruling the roost. Homebuilders are also amongst top-risers. US stocks look set to open basically unchanged following a day that saw the biggest daily gain after a loss of over 100 points for the Dow Jones Industrial Average since February. German bond yields are back in positive territory, reflecting a tick-up in risk appetite on Friday. The yield on benchmark 10-year bund yields is 0.005% after turning negative for the first time ever earlier in the week amid heightened investor caution. The pound is rising against the dollar and the euro this morning. Sterling is up 0.4% against the dollar at $1.4254 and up 0.2% against the euro at \u20ac1.2672. UK investor sentiment has picked up following the suspension of the EU referendum campaign. Full story on Christine Lagarde\u2019s speech: Lagarde\u2019s full speech is available here. She says the UK has benefited from additional jobs and income gains generated from increased trade with the EU as a result of its membership. This is not trade that would have happened anyway, or trade that has simply been diverted away from other parts of the world. The formation of the EU and the single market has been instrumental in generating more trade than would otherwise have been the case. And with more trade has come more investment, as the U.K. has become integrated into European supply chains\u2014such as in the aerospace industry, and in factories producing cars for the whole European market. Increased trade has also raised productivity and incomes by increasing the scope for economies of scale in production and efficient specialisation. Lagarde is also making a broader argument for unity in Europe. Pro Europeans must speak out against the tide of negativity surrounding the European project, she says: Right now, too many Europeans are worried about their cultural identity, their security, their jobs, incomes, and living standards. And too many of them are led to believe that things would be better if only Europe returned to closed borders and economic nationalism. This is a serious challenge for the European project. It is high time to confront this negative vision with a new perspective for those citizens who feel left behind. Those who believe that only a united Europe can be prosperous and dynamic need to step forward and speak up. Christine Lagarde, the head of the International Monetary Fund, has urged the UK to stay in the EU. Giving an impassioned speech in Vienna, Lagarde said that while the EU was not perfect, Britain had been more successful as a result of its membership. Membership in the EU has made the UK a richer economy, but it has also made it a more diverse, more exciting, and more creative country. As in all countries, there are people who are struggling in this new environment, but for the majority of citizens, this has been a great success story. It has been said that \u201cit takes great courage to see the world in all its tainted glory, and still to love it.\u201d So I wish bon courage to our fellow Europeans from the United Kingdom! Some garden centre news now, as we approach the weekend... Tesco has sold Dobbies, the UK\u2019s second largest garden centre chain, for \u00a3217m. Dobbies has 35 garden centres across Scotland, England and Northern Ireland, and was bought by Tesco for \u00a3150m in 2007. The supermarket chain has sold the company to a group of investors led by Midlothian Capital Partners and Hattington Capital. It is the latest in a string of a disposals by Tesco, as it attempts to focus its UK retail business on its \u201ccore strengths\u201d. Read our full story here. Connor Campbell, analyst at Spreadex, says the Greek deal is helping to lift investor spirits this morning. Once again the markets have bounced away from their lows, a solid US session and confirmation of a fresh Greek bailout seemingly lifting investors\u2019 spirits. Jumping by 1% the FTSE enjoyed the recovery from its commodity and finance stocks this Friday, with Brent Crude now back approaching $48 per barrel. The eurozone saw a similar (dead cat?) bounce this morning, the DAX and CAC rising 1.3% and 1.4% respectively. Unlike the FTSE, however, the region\u2019s indices arguably had something to celebrate, with European Commissioner Pierre Moscovici revealing that yesterday\u2019s Eurogroup meeting had seen the finance ministers sign off on Greece\u2019s latest \u20ac7.5bn tranche of funding just in time for the country\u2019s hefty July loan repayments. Christine Lagarde, head of the International Monetary Fund, is in Vienna and will be giving a speech on European unity at 10am UK time. We will bring you the highlights. The bank\u2019s are leading the charge on the FTSE this morning. Lloyds Banking Group is the top riser, up 5.5% at 65p. Biggest risers: Biggest fallers: Markets appear to be taking a breather from Brexit fears today following the suspension of the referendum campaign. The campaign was suspended on Thursday following the death of Jo Cox, the Labour MP for Batley and Spen. The International Monetary Fund will publish its latest report on the UK at midnight. The Washington-based fund said on Thursday it was delaying publication by 24 hours \u201cout of respect for today\u2019s tragic event in the UK.\u201d Oil prices are climbing this morning, as the fears pervading markets over recent days appear to ease. Brent crude oil is up 1.6% at $47.96 a barrel. The FTSE 100 is back above the 6,000 mark, driven higher by the banks. It\u2019s up 74 points. All major European markets are trading strongly this morning: FTSE 100: +1.2% at 6,024 Germany\u2019s DAX: +1.1% at 9,658 France\u2019s CAC: +1.1% at 4,198 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB: +2.3% at 16,723 Spain\u2019s IBEX: +1.9% at 8,352 European markets have opened higher, following Wall Street\u2019s gains on Thursday. The FTSE 100 is hovering close to the 6,000 mark, up 0.8% or 48 points at 5,998. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Good news for Greece, as its eurozone creditors have agreed to release a \u20ac7.5bn (\u00a36bn) tranche of funding urgently needed by Athens. Pierre Moscovici, European Commissioner for economic and financial affairs, said the agreement was \u201ca welcome breath of oxygen for the Greek economy,\u201d after ministers from the eurozone\u2019s 19 countries agreed to unlock funds. Minsters gave the green light at a meeting in Luxembourg after agreeing Greece had made sufficient progress on reforms, but the technical details of releasing the funds will be dealt with by senior officials today. The money is expected to arrive in Athens next week, allowing the government to meet two debt repayments to the European Central Bank next month. Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras was clearly relieved and said the funding would allow Greece to move into a new, more positive phase: A cycle is ending for the country. The country is entering a stable macroeconomic, fiscal and investment environment.",

Joshua Mahony, market analyst at IG, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>For once we are seeing market jitters emerge from the US markets today, as relatively solid session for the FTSE has been overshadowed by a sharp deterioration in US equities today. The fears surrounding a Brexit have abated somewhat today, with a break from the polls allowing for a more positive end to a very mixed up week for UK equities. Crucially, the incessant rise in crude prices today has provided enough emphasis to keep the main UK benchmark afloat.</p> <p>Today\u2019s ultra-dovish comments from the traditionally hawkish St. Louis Fed President Jim Bullard mark a significant shift in emphasis at the FOMC, with an indication we could only yet see one hike in the next 18 months. While there is no doubt that Fed confidence will have been knocked by this month\u2019s payrolls shocker, the accompaniment of a growth slowdown means that Janet Yellen\u2019s dream of a summer hike may turn into a dream of a 2017 hike.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5764113de4b01f3be8715c98\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-06-17T15:06:34.075Z\">4.06pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The uncertainty over the result of the UK referendum has seen investors pull out $1.1bn from UK equity funds in the past week, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch.</p> <p>This is the fastest pace for 13 months and the second largest outflow over the past decade, after the last general election.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/JoelLewin/status/743795780675317760\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Brexit- there&#39;s really nothing to be afraid of, honest <a href=\"https://t.co/IM9NXmI22p\">pic.twitter.com/IM9NXmI22p</a></p>&mdash; Joel Lewin (@JoelLewin) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JoelLewin/status/743795780675317760\">June 17, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57640bb5e4b01f3be8715c5c\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-06-17T14:40:57.631Z\">3.40pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Donald Tusk, head of the European Council, has shared his meeting schedule for next week.</p> <p>Wonder what they\u2019ll find to talk about at 10.30 on Friday 24th?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/eucopresident/status/743812401238269952\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">My agenda next week: <a href=\"https://t.co/DSHlHapmCe\">https://t.co/DSHlHapmCe</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/sYLPRL8DGM\">pic.twitter.com/sYLPRL8DGM</a></p>&mdash; Donald Tusk (@eucopresident) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/eucopresident/status/743812401238269952\">June 17, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57640970e4b0b4b233940b78\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-06-17T14:33:39.471Z\">3.33pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>It\u2019s the calm before next week\u2019s probable storm in the markets</strong>, according to Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex. With European shares heading higher after the suspension of Brexit campaigning, Campbell said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Doing its best to dampen the day\u2019s rebound was the Dow Jones, the US index opening 20 to 40 points lower after the bell. There wasn\u2019t necessarily much to cause that decline bar a relatively weak pair of housing starts and building permits readings. Nevertheless the Dow sporadically dipped below 17700, perhaps playing catch up with the sharper declines seen across the week in Europe.</p> <p>Talking of Europe, while the Eurozone indices lost some of their lustre (the DAX now up by a reduced 0.7%) the FTSE held on its growth this afternoon, the UK index increasing by 1.1%. The pound, meanwhile, saw an even more surprising rise, with cable at points grazing $1.43 for the first time since the start of the week.</p> <p>Given their behaviour in the past few days the markets could be in for a real rough ride next week. The persistent polls likely to leak out in the run up to the referendum should leave the pound in a constant state of flux, while the FTSE may well see itself return to that 5900, 4 month low pretty quickly on Monday. However, while the potential post-Brexit reaction is clear, it will be interesting to see how much momentum the markets can gain if Britain opts to remain in the EU, an eventuality seemingly backed by the behaviour of Spreadex\u2019s clients.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5763ffbce4b0b4b233940b29\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-06-17T14:14:38.113Z\">3.14pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>The result of the UK referendum could spark a spate of central bank intervention in the currency markets, including the Bank of England and potentially the Bank of Japan which has been worried about the strength of the yen anyway.</strong></p> <p>But a Brexit is less of a risk than Grexit - if Greece left the eurozone - according to Alan Ruskin. strategist at Deutsche Bank. He said in a note to clients:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The most likely scenario for the Bank of Japan to intervene and sell yen in the currency market, is if US dollar/Japanese yen threatened or breached Y100 following the UK referendum. Presumably, the Yen would also be registering even larger gains versus European currencies in such circumstances. In that situation, the Bank of Japan would likely intervene \u2018under the cover\u2019 of the UK referendum vote, by making a strong case to the US and G20, that i) Japan is being placed under unique duress from a dramatic tightening in financial conditions allied to the stronger yen; and, ii) that the exchange rate is reflective of volatile international events, and not domestic conditions.</p> </blockquote> <p>As for the Bank of England, any intervention was likely to be co-ordinated with the European Central Bank and the US Federal Reserve:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Were sterling trading to become particularly unruly following the UK referendum (say Cable through 1.30 and continuing to drop) the Bank of England is unlikely to sit idly by. Were the Bank of Englan to intervene to support the pound, it would make sense to also have the ECB and Federal Reserve intervene on the Bank of England\u2019s behalf, as a signal of global solidarity.</p> <p>Only if events in the foreign exchange market were reflective of a global systemic event that might trigger a significant tightening in financial conditions in the the US, would the Fed intervene on its own book.</p> <p>Such a global systemic spillover is not expected. The precedent of a potential Grexit was far more threatening for financial markets than the UK referendum, if only because monetary unions promote huge financial flows premised on a fixed exchange rate/price, and there are large winners and losers when they unravel. Unraveling trade agreements, do not have the same immediate risk management implications that lead to self reinforcing financial dislocations. </p> </blockquote> <p>At the moment Cable - the sterling dollar rate - is at $1.4295.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-06-17T14:20:40.142Z\">at 3.20pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-57640230e4b01f3be8715c1e\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-06-17T14:01:03.611Z\">3.01pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>More on the comments from German finance minister Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble on Brexit.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Tesco has ceased 24-hour trading at another tranche of supermarkets as part of a shakeup that puts 2,000 jobs on the line. The supermarket has begun a 45-day consultation with nightshift workers and with staff displaced by plans to merge customer service counters. It said 46 stores were affected by the changes, with 20 ceasing round-the-clock trading. It comes as Tesco confirmed the sale of Dobbies, the UK\u2019s second largest garden centre chain, for \u00a3217m to two private equity houses. The deal with Midlothian Capital Partners and Hattington Capital is the latest in a series of asset disposals by the Tesco chief executive, Dave Lewis. It helped send shares up 1.7% to 155.23p. In January, Tesco halted 24-hour trading at 76 of its biggest stores. The latest move will leave just over 300 operating through the night. \u201cWe\u2019re making some changes to the way a small number of our stores operate to help us run them more simply and deliver the best possible service to customers,\u201d said Tesco\u2019s UK chief operating officer, Tony Hoggett. \u201cWhere there have been changes to a colleague\u2019s role, we will work with them to ensure they are fully supported.\u201d A Tesco spokesman said it would aim to redeploy staff within their existing store or to a local branch, but redundancy was an option. Dobbies was Tesco\u2019s first non-food acquisition, bought for \u00a3155m in 2007 when Sir Terry Leahy was in charge. The Scottish-based business slid \u00a348m into the red last year after writing down the value of its stores, even though sales rose 8% to \u00a3153m. The new owners said they had a plan for growth, vowed to protect the chain\u2019s 2,869 jobs and said they intend to keep its head office in Lasswade, near Edinburgh. New store openings are planned across the UK, from Scotland to places including Oxford and Winchester in the south. \u201cIt\u2019s a truly iconic Scottish business,\u201d said Andrew Bracey, a founding partner at Midlothian and a former finance chief of online grocer Ocado. He said Dobbies had been well looked after by Tesco, which opened 17 new outlets and invested heavily in the stores, modernising them with a Scandinavian-style design. The garden centres are more than just plant nurseries; they boast restaurants, homewares and food halls and promise a \u201cfamily day out\u201d. Barney Burgess, a partner at Hattington Capital who previously worked for Tesco as commercial director and ran the supermarket\u2019s home delivery service, will work on expanding Dobbies\u2019 online platform. He said that he learned a huge amount in his eight years at Tesco. \u201cIt was an invaluable part of my career,\u201d he said, but added that it \u201chad its highs and lows\u201d. Lewis, who was brought in two years ago to turn Britain\u2019s biggest supermarket chain around, has been selling off underperforming smaller divisions to focus on the main UK grocery business. He said it had been a difficult decision to sellDobbies, but added: \u201cWe believe this agreement will give Dobbies a bright future, while allowing our UK retail business to focus on its core strengths.\u201d The deal comes a week after Tesco announced the sale of its lossmaking Giraffe restaurant chain and its Turkish retail business, Kipa. It offloaded its South Korean chain for \u00a34bn last September to cut debt. The lossmaking Harris + Hoole coffee shop chain could be next. Graham Spooner, investment research analyst at retail stockbroker the Share Centre, said: \u201cInvestors may be encouraged by this activity as the supermarket takes further steps towards recovery. \u201cHowever, we still regard Tesco as no more than a \u2018hold\u2019 for the time being, as long-term prospects remain uncertain. The Financial Conduct Authority investigation into financial misconduct, following the accounting scandal of 2014, is likely to continue for some time, while margins continue to be squeezed by competition from discount brands such as Aldi and Lidl.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Royal Bank of Scotland is in talks to sponsor English cricket as it looks for ways to promote its NatWest brand in England and Wales. The Edinburgh-based bank is to give increased prominence to its NatWest operations as it pulls back further from the global domination pursued under Fred Goodwin before its 2008 bailout. The NatWest logo could replace that of Waitrose supermarket on the shirts of cricket players if talks with the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) can be completed. NatWest has a long association with English cricket, covering sponsorship of county cricket and the T20 Blast. The increased visibility of the NatWest brand is also being imposed on RBS by the European Union under the terms of its \u00a345bn taxpayer bailout \u2013 the RBS brand will in effect disappear from England and Wales. The 300 RBS branches on high streets in England and Wales and a handful of NatWest branches in Scotland are being replaced by the Williams &amp; Glyn brand to comply with the EU\u2019s requirement that it create a new high street bank. The RBS brand will, however, retain its dominant presence on Scottish high streets. The makeover has been planned for some time. Last year, it emerged that RBS intended to axe its bold uppercase logo and replace it with rbs. RBS also has other brands, such as the private bank Coutts, which recently announced it would sponsor Sir Ben Ainslie\u2019s America\u2019s Cup team. But the bank, which declined to comment on a report it was tying with up the ECB, is no longer attempting to make its brand known globally as it had been before its near-collapse, when it was plastered over entrances at Edinburgh airport and on Formula One cars. Offloading Williams &amp; Glyn has proved complicated, and in April the bank admitted it might miss the deadline, which had already been extended to December next year. RBS has also said it may try to sell the branches rather than conduct a stock market flotation.",

NatWest has a long association with English cricket, covering sponsorship of county cricket and the T20 Blast. </p> <p>The increased visibility of the NatWest brand is also being imposed on RBS by the European Union under the terms of its \u00a345bn taxpayer bailout \u2013 the RBS brand will in effect disappear from England and Wales.</p> <p>The 300 RBS branches on high streets in England and Wales and a handful of NatWest branches in Scotland are being replaced by the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/feb/28/williams-glyns-bank-resurrected\">Williams &amp; Glyn</a> brand to comply with the EU\u2019s requirement that it create a new high street bank.

Mark Carney, the governor of the Bank of England, had intended to announce the so-called fintech accelerator in his annual Mansion House speech on Thursday. However, he did not deliver the scheduled speech and instead paid tribute to the late MP Jo Cox as a \u201cremarkable person\u201d who \u201cdedicated her life to helping others\u201d. Threadneedle Street issued his remarks on Friday, in which he set out the importance of fintech and the implications that innovation in finance could have on managing the economy and financial stability. Carney said: \u201cFintech should neither be the wild west nor strangled at birth. The Bank is devoting considerable resources to ensure whatever develops is sustainable, not ephemeral.\u201d He said it would \u201cchange the nature of money, shake the foundations of central banking and deliver nothing less than a democratic revolution for all who use financial services\u201d. \u201cThe \u2018accelerator\u2019 will work with new technology firms to help us harness fintech innovations for central banking.

In this way the service providers will not have to rely on the banks with which they are competing to gain access to the payments network. \u201cIt should also enable more efficient, effective and inclusive payments, including in ways that we cannot fully anticipate,\u201d Carney said. Firms that sign up to use RTGS will also be subjected to regulation, he added. A blockchain is the technology that guarantees the authenticity of an online currency by creating publicly available \u201cledgers\u201d of transactions in blocks of data.

    "webTitle": "Flatpacks and free tube travel: how developers are shifting luxury flats", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Flatpack furniture, stamp duty payments and three years of free tube travel are among the sweeteners being offered to buyers of luxury flats in London as developers scramble to revive a waning market. Investors and owner-occupiers can choose from a range of incentives on properties across the capital, with housebuilders attempting to sell homes in a market knocked by changes to stamp duty and uncertainty over the upcoming EU referendum. Buyers of a one-bedroom apartment on the edge of London\u2019s financial district in Aldgate, where prices start at \u00a3780,000, are being offered three years of free travel if they can move in before July. The zone 1-3 travelcard provided by developer Barratt London is worth \u00a31,520 in the first year. At the developer\u2019s Catford Green site in south-east London, the same offer is available on two-bedroom homes. A range of incentives offered by Taylor Wimpey to potential buyers include free furniture packs, a year\u2019s ground rent and service charge paid, and a rental guarantee \u2013 aimed at buy-to let landlords \u2013 for the first year of ownership, equal to 5% of the purchase price. The offer is available on several developments, including the Music Box in Southwark, central London, where prices start at \u00a3737,500. Since December 2014, buyers paying more than \u00a3937,500 for a property have faced higher stamp duty bills; on 1 April 2016, those costs were increased again with a new three percentage point surcharge on second homes. At Galliard\u2019s Marine Wharf East development in Surrey Quays, south-east London, where flats start at \u00a3430,000, investors are being offered a stamp duty payment, alongside their choice of a free furniture package or one year with no service charge. On Wednesday, Berkeley Homes said it had seen a 20% decline in reservations in the the first five months of the year and had not launched any new schemes in London over the same period. The upmarket developer said it was offering to absorb the increased stamp duty at the top end of the market. At Nine Elms Point in Battersea, south-west London, and Enderby Wharf in Greenwich, south-east London, Barratt London is offering to cover stamp duty on some of the larger, more expensive apartments for sale. The saving on the two-bedroom apartments covered by the offer at Nine Elms Point starts at \u00a332,149, according to the developer\u2019s website. About 35,000 prime properties are in the pipeline in London, according to consultancy firm Arcadis, and nearly 17,000 are due to be completed by the end of 2018. In a report on the market, Arcadis\u2019s head of commercial development, Mark Cleverly, said the financial viability of prime property would be under pressure for the next two to three years as construction costs rise faster than sale prices. Without a cut in stamp duty, he added, there was likely to be lower growth in the prime market. Cleverly said housebuilders\u2019 offers to pay stamp duty for buyers would \u201ctake a serious chunk out of gross development values and developers\u2019 margins\u201d. Jonathan Hopper, the managing director of Garrington, which finds homes for wealthy clients, said it had \u201cbeen a few years in the making, but luxury property developers are now in the midst of a perfect storm\u201d. A series of \u201cdemand-sapping factors\u201d had hit the market, from stamp duty rises to EU referendum uncertainty, he added. \u201cThe challenges are particularly acute in the new build sector, with global economic turbulence curtailing demand from the overseas buyers who for years inflated the market in the mistaken belief that any luxury property with a London postcode would automatically turn to gold,\u201d Hopper said. \u201cWith so many luxury developments now being built, there\u2019s suddenly a danger of oversupply \u2013 and some developers fear being left with unsold stock on their hands. As a result, there are some incredible offers out there and the dynamic has shifted firmly to a buyer\u2019s, rather than a seller\u2019s, market.\u201d Hopper said buyers were increasingly holding the cards, but they should remember that a discount does not automatically equal a bargain. \u201cIn some cases, the price reduction is merely the absence of froth, rather than a steal,\u201d he said. David Galman, the sales director at Galliard, said the market in properties costing between \u00a3750,000 and \u00a31.5m had \u201cdefinitely gone off the boil. I think last year\u2019s budget and Brexit have been factors\u201d. The company added a \u201cBrexit clause\u201d to sales of flats in Slough, Berkshire, launched on 9 June. \u201cWe probably didn\u2019t need to do it actually \u2013 we had a good launch. All of the buyers get it, but only around 10% to 15% were keen to make sure it was there,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t think anyone\u2019s going to pull out of buying a \u00a3250,000 flat in Slough because we\u2019ve voted to leave the EU.\u201d The company has long offered free legal work for buyers: Galman said it was worth the cost to know that a deal was progressing. \u201cWhen the stamp duty increase was announced, I felt that we would all have to absorb some of the costs as a way to keep the market going along,\u201d he said. Galman said investors were keen on the incentives of interest on a deposit and guaranteed rent in the early years. \u201cWe don\u2019t think that is going to cost us very much \u2013 we think the rental market is very robust. We have an interest in the rental company too.\u201d New offers brought interest from investors and owner-occupiers, he added. However, Galman said \u201cpeople are sitting on their hands until Brexit comes. But I\u2019m not sure what will happen after that, because it\u2019s the end of June and the holidays are starting \u2013 it could stay quiet until September.\u201d Barratt London said it regularly offered incentives at its developments. Gary Patrick, its regional sales director, said: \u201cWe offer incentives on selected apartments as it is a great way to promote the development. For example, we are currently offering a free TfL [Transport for London] travelcard on every two-bedroom apartment purchased at Catford Green, valid for three years across zones 1-3. On other selected developments, we sometimes offer incentives such as stamp duty paid, free furniture packs or paying legal fees. These all help to give extra value to our customers.\u201d Henry Pryor, a buying agent who works in London and the south-east, said incentives were always introduced when the market was getting harder for sellers, and that some were worth having. \u201cTransaction costs such as stamp duty usually have to be paid out of taxed income, and part exchange deals where the developer buys your old home can save time and aggravation; but never forget who ultimately pays for these inducements \u2013 the buyer either directly or over 25 years of your mortgage,\u201d he said. \u201cPersonally, I prefer to pay less in the first place.\u201d Simon Wainwright, the director of JPW Real Estate, which advises companies on the development of sites and manages finished buildings, said sales had been slowing. \u201cSome of [the developers] feel that they have got a high exposure to the top end of the market,\u201d he said. \u201cThe result is that there are developers who have parties going out and saying that we can do you 20 units at a 10% discount, and if you take 30 you can have 15% off ... They are prepared to take a hit to de-risk these projects.\u201d Wainwright said sales were being made to private equity firms that would keep them until they could resell at a profit. \u201cThe stamp duty schemes are more for individuals,\u201d he said.",

All of the buyers get it, but only around 10% to 15% were keen to make sure it was there,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t think anyone\u2019s going to pull out of buying a \u00a3250,000 flat in Slough because we\u2019ve voted to leave the EU.\u201d</p> <p>The company has long offered free legal work for buyers: Galman said it was worth the cost to know that a deal was progressing. \u201cWhen the stamp duty increase was announced, I felt that we would all have to absorb some of the costs as a way to keep the market going along,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Galman said investors were keen on the incentives of interest on a deposit and guaranteed rent in the early years. \u201cWe don\u2019t think that is going to cost us very much \u2013 we think the rental market is very robust. We have an interest in the rental company too.\u201d New offers brought interest from investors and owner-occupiers, he added. <br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>However, Galman said \u201cpeople are sitting on their hands until Brexit comes. But I\u2019m not sure what will happen after that, because it\u2019s the end of June and the holidays are starting \u2013 it could stay quiet until September.\u201d<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Barratt London said it regularly offered incentives at its developments. Gary Patrick, its regional sales director, said: \u201cWe offer incentives on selected apartments as it is a great way to promote the development. For example, we are currently offering a free TfL [Transport for London] travelcard on every two-bedroom apartment purchased at Catford Green, valid for three years across zones 1-3. On other selected developments, we sometimes offer incentives such as stamp duty paid, free furniture packs or paying legal fees. These all help to give extra value to our customers.\u201d</p> <p>Henry Pryor, a buying agent who works in London and the south-east, said incentives were always introduced when the market was getting harder for sellers, and that some were worth having.<br></p> <p>\u201cTransaction costs such as stamp duty usually have to be paid out of taxed income, and part exchange deals where the developer buys your old home can save time and aggravation; but never forget who ultimately pays for these inducements \u2013 the buyer either directly or over 25 years of your mortgage,\u201d he said. \u201cPersonally, I prefer to pay less in the first place.\u201d </p> <p>Simon Wainwright, the director of JPW Real Estate, which advises companies on the development of sites and manages finished buildings, said sales had been slowing. \u201cSome of [the developers] feel that they have got a high exposure to the top end of the market,\u201d he said. \u201cThe result is that there are developers who have parties going out and saying that we can do you 20 units at a 10% discount, and if you take 30 you can have 15% off ... They are prepared to take a hit to de-risk these projects.\u201d</p> <p>Wainwright said sales were being made to private equity firms that would keep them until they could resell at a profit. \u201cThe stamp duty schemes are more for individuals,\u201d he said.</p>",

They are currently 4% higher at 232.3p, but analysts at Societe General still believe Ocado, along with Tesco, has the most to lose from the competitive threat of AmazonFresh. Putting sell recommendations on both businesses, they said: They are players we think are most at risk (strong presence in the London area) if AmazonFresh is successful in the UK. J. Sainsbury (hold) is not immune to the Amazon threat but its strong differentiation (high quality products, well-recognised private label) could help protect the business. As regards Morrisons (sell), we see a potential risk of cannibalisation of morrisons.com given the wholesale agreement signed with Amazon. Of course there has been much speculation Ocado could be a takeover target, not least for Amazon. But Societe Generale are unconvinced. Running through the possible predators, it said: In the UK online food market, the key question is whether Ocado could become a potential acquisition candidate for the other food retailers. We think Tesco and Sainsbury\u2019s are unlikely to acquire Ocado. With 2015 online food sales of \u00a32.9bn and \u00a31.0bn, respectively, according to our estimates, both groups have successfully developed their online activities. For Morrisons, we think that an acquisition is unlikely as well despite the logistics agreement that is already in place with Ocado. We see two potential obstacles: 1) This would be a significant investment for Morrisons. Ocado\u2019s market capitalisation currently stands at \u00a31.3bn (vs \u00a34.1bn for Morrisons); 2) There is a significant gap in terms of valuation. Ocado is currently trading at 1.1x of 2016e sales vs 0.36x for Morrisons. Such an acquisition could be difficult to justify. An acquisition by Asda/Wal-Mart is not impossible if Wal-Mart really wants to acquire Ocado\u2019s proprietary technology and use it in its other countries. The US giant already acquired an online grocery pure player in China, i.e. Yihaodian. Note, however, that the short-term priority for Wal-Mart is probably to turn around Asda (appointment of Sean Clarke as new CEO in place of Andy Clarke). Could Ocado become an acquisition candidate for Amazon? In the short term, we think Amazon will try to accelerate its online food development organically. Amazon has solved the issue of sourcing fresh products thanks to its wholesale agreement with Morrisons. We think Amazon could become interested by Ocado if it ran into difficulties in the efficient preparation of orders and delivery. If this was the case, Amazon could become interested in Ocado\u2019s proprietary technologies.",

    "webTitle": "Revlon to buy Elizabeth Arden", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "US cosmetics company Revlon has agreed to buy Elizabeth Arden in an $870m (\u00a3611m) deal, which will bring together Revlon\u2019s cosmetics and hair colour products and with its rival\u2019s anti-ageing creams and celebrity fragrances. The move will create a cosmetics giant with annual sales of $3bn. It comes less than six months after Revlon\u2019s main shareholder and chairman, the billionaire Ron Perelman, said he was considering options for the business. The New York-based firm has been struggling under its heavy borrowings and the deal will help it refinance the debt. Fabian Garcia, previously Colgate-Palmolive\u2019s chief operating officer, was brought in as Revlon\u2019s new chief executive in March. Garcia said Elizabeth Arden was \u201cone of the last independent iconic brands in the cosmetics industry\u201d. Elizabeth Arden, based in Florida, is known for its luxury skincare products, especially anti-ageing ranges, such as Prevage, Ceramide and its trademark Eight Hour range, which was launched in 1930 and is still the brand\u2019s bestseller. Its fragrances include those licensed from celebrities including Britney Spears, Justin Bieber and Taylor Swift. However, the popularity of celebrity fragrances has waned, with sales falling over the past year, while Elizabeth Arden\u2019s namesake brand has been performing much better. Revlon is stronger in hair colour and colour cosmetics, which are sold through mass retail channels and beauty salons in 130 countries. The acquisition will expand the firm\u2019s presence around the world, after it pulled out of China about two years ago. The beauty market is a tough business: the pair are up against New York-based Est\u00e9e Lauder, which is controlled by the Lauder family and recently announced 1,200 job cuts, and Paris-based L\u2019Or\u00e9al, the world\u2019s largest cosmetics company, which is part-owned by by the Bettencourt family and Nestl\u00e9. The equity value of the deal is $419m, with the rest made up by debt. Revlon said (pdf) it would pay $14 a share for Elizabeth Arden, a 50% premium to Thursday\u2019s closing share price. Bank of America Merrill Lynch and Citigroup have committed $2.6bn to fund the deal and refinance the debt of the two cosmetics makers. The deal is expected to generate $140m of savings by removing overlap, integrating the manufacturing and distribution networks of both companies and giving them greater purchasing power. Thetakeover is expected to go through by the end of December. Revlon was founded in 1932 by Charles Revson, his brother Joseph and a chemist, Charles Lachman, who contributed the L in the Revlon name. During the Great Depression, they started with a single product, a nail polish. Using a blended pigment formula, it was the first red nail varnish \u2013 at a time when the only shades available were pale and sheer. Named Cherries in the Snow, it was inspired by the scarlet-lipped Hollywood starlets of their day and is still on sale today. Lipstick became the firm\u2019s next big item in 1940 after Charles Revson noticed a woman in a restaurant whose lips and nail polish did not match. The company then launched an advertising campaign touting \u201cmatching lips and fingertips\u201d. Elizabeth Arden dates to 1910 when the eponymous founder opened her first \u201cRed Door\u201d spa on Fifth Avenue \u2013 at a time when it was rare for women to wear makeup, much less run their own businesses. An advocate for women\u2019s rights, she once marched with 15,000 fellow suffragettes wearing red lipstick as a symbol of strength and developed cosmetics for women serving in the military during the second world war. The brand recently signed up model and Instagram star Kendall Jenner, half-sister of Kim Kardashian, to appeal to younger women.",

The New York-based firm has been struggling under its heavy borrowings and the deal will help it refinance the debt.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/gallery/2016/jun/17/classic-revlon-and-elizabeth-arden-adverts-in-pictures\">Classic Revlon and Elizabeth Arden adverts - in pictures</a> </p> </aside>  <p><a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-03-28/revlon-names-colgate-executive-fabian-garcia-as-its-next-ceo\">Fabian Garcia, previously Colgate-Palmolive\u2019s chief operating officer</a>, was brought in as Revlon\u2019s new chief executive in March. Garcia said Elizabeth Arden was \u201cone of the last independent iconic brands in the cosmetics industry\u201d.</p> <p>Elizabeth Arden, based in Florida, is known for its luxury skincare products, especially anti-ageing ranges, such as Prevage, Ceramide and its trademark Eight Hour range, which was launched in 1930 and is still the brand\u2019s bestseller. Its fragrances include those licensed from celebrities including Britney Spears, Justin Bieber and Taylor Swift. However, the popularity of celebrity fragrances has waned, with sales falling over the past year, while Elizabeth Arden\u2019s namesake brand has been performing much better.<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"e0f91244afba6795601e4cb61852060a83597b22\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e0f91244afba6795601e4cb61852060a83597b22/0_150_3600_4500/800.jpg\" alt=\"A 1978 advert for Revlon\u2019s Charlie nail polish.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A 1978 advert for Revlon\u2019s Charlie nail polish.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Revlon is stronger in hair colour and colour cosmetics, which are sold through mass retail channels and beauty salons in 130 countries. The acquisition will expand the firm\u2019s presence around the world, after it pulled out of China about two years ago.</p> <p>The beauty market is a tough business: the pair are up against New York-based Est\u00e9e Lauder, which is controlled by the Lauder family and recently announced 1,200 job cuts, and Paris-based L\u2019Or\u00e9al, the world\u2019s largest cosmetics company, which is part-owned by by the Bettencourt family and Nestl\u00e9.</p> <p> The equity value of the deal is $419m, with the rest made up by debt. <a href=\"http://file:///Volumes/Downloads/Internet%20Downloads/Revlon%20to%20Acquire%20Elizabeth%20Arden%20-%20Press%20Release.pdf\">Revlon said</a> (pdf) it would pay $14 a share for Elizabeth Arden, a 50% premium to Thursday\u2019s closing share price. Bank of America Merrill Lynch and Citigroup have committed $2.6bn to fund the deal and refinance the debt of the two cosmetics makers.</p> <p>The deal is expected to generate $140m of savings by removing overlap, integrating the manufacturing and distribution networks of both companies and giving them greater purchasing power. Thetakeover is expected to go through by the end of December.</p> <p>Revlon was founded in 1932 by Charles Revson, his brother Joseph and a chemist, Charles Lachman, who contributed the L in the Revlon name. During the Great Depression, they started with a single product, a nail polish. Using a blended pigment formula, it was the first red nail varnish \u2013 at a time when the only shades available were pale and sheer.</p> <p>Named Cherries in the Snow, it was inspired by the scarlet-lipped Hollywood starlets of their day and is still on sale today. Lipstick became the firm\u2019s next big item in 1940 after Charles Revson noticed a woman in a restaurant whose lips and nail polish did not match. The company then launched an advertising campaign touting \u201cmatching lips and fingertips\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e6ba0a1580e55874682119c3633c21d20bbfb076\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e6ba0a1580e55874682119c3633c21d20bbfb076/496_221_1631_978/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Elizabeth Arden at a horse race in New York City\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Elizabeth Arden at a horse race in New York City.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Everett/REX/Shutterstock/Everett/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Elizabeth Arden dates to 1910 when the eponymous founder opened her first \u201cRed Door\u201d spa on Fifth Avenue \u2013 at a time when<a href=\"https://www.elizabetharden.com/Elizabeth-Arden-Biography/her-story,default,pg.html\"> it was rare for women to wear makeup, much less run their own businesses</a>. </p> <p>An advocate for women\u2019s rights, she once marched with 15,000 fellow suffragettes wearing red lipstick as a symbol of strength and developed cosmetics for women serving in the military during the second world war.</p> <p>The brand recently signed up model and Instagram star Kendall Jenner, half-sister of Kim Kardashian, to appeal to younger women.</p>",

Christine Lagarde used a speech in Vienna to warn of a worrying rise in economic nationalism that threatened the union and urged policymakers to do more to reduce the inequality that made some Europeans \u201cfeel left behind\u201d. With less than a week to go until the referendum, Lagarde repeated her assertion that it made economic sense to stay in the EU and rebuffed suggestions that migration had hurt the jobs market. In her latest intervention, the French-born IMF managing director also pointed to Britain\u2019s track record on migration. Noting the role of refugee and migration issues in the referendum, she said: \u201cI have always admired the United Kingdom for it openness to other nationalities and foreign cultures, and I find it hard to believe that attitudes have changed in such a short time. But this is for British voters to decide, and their decision clearly depends on many factors.\u201d Lagarde repeated the IMF\u2019s view that the economic risks of Brexit were \u201cfirmly to the downside\u201d. She said there was a clear case of how the UK had benefited from more jobs and income as a result of increased trade in the EU and greater investment. She added: \u201cBeing part of the EU has greatly aided the transformation of the UK into a dynamic and vibrant economy. The UK has benefited from the many contributions of talented and hard-working migrants from all over the world, including the EU, while providing record-high levels of employment for all its residents.\u201d \u201cAs in all countries, there are people who are struggling in this new environment, but for the majority of citizens, this has been a great success story.\u201d On the wider EU, Lagarde built on her recent remarks about growing protectionism and the rise of nationalist parties. \u201cToo many Europeans are worried about their cultural identity, their security, their jobs, incomes, and living standards. And too many of them are led to believe that things would be better if only Europe returned to closed borders and economic nationalism,\u201d she said in the speech entitled Unity in diversity: the case for Europe. \u201cThis is a serious challenge for the European project. It is high time to confront this negative vision with a new perspective for those citizens who feel left behind.\u201d Previous IMF interventions in the 23 June referendum have drawn an angry response from leave campaigners who have said the organisation should not interfere in the UK\u2019s democratic process. The leave camp has also attacked its record on economic forecasting. The IMF said last month Brexit could trigger a stock market crash and a steep fall in house prices. Lagarde\u2019s latest comments on the issuet echoed the Bank of England\u2019s warning on Thursday that leaving the EU would risk pushing the pound sharply lower and sending shockwaves through the global economy.",
