The Austrian National Bank will spend the next five years flying gold bars back to Vienna to raise its own stocks to half the total of 280 tonnes. The move echoes Germany\u2019s plan in 2013 to repatriate all of its gold stocked in France as well as some of the reserves held in the United States, to ensure at least 50% was kept on German soil by 2020. Until now the Austrian National Bank has relied on the Bank of England to watch over most of its \u00a36.7bn gold reserves. The BoE looks after much of the world\u2019s gold as most central banks send some of the stocks to London for safekeeping. Now the BoE\u2019s stock of the precious metal will be reduced to 30%, while Austria will hold 50% and Switzerland 20%. The Austrian authorities appeared to be conscious of the perils of bulk-storing gold in the manner of Fort Knox in the US, made famous by Auric Goldfinger\u2019s attempted heist in the third James Bond film.

      "bodyText": "The relationship between retailers and their suppliers is to be scrutinised in the wake of the Tesco accounting scandal \u2013 in which the group overstated last year\u2019s expected first-half profits by about \u00a3250m. The Financial Reporting Council (FRC), the UK\u2019s auditing and accountancy watchdog, plans to make food retailing a priority sector for audit inspections this year. The FRC will \u201cpay particular attention to the audit of revenue recognition and complex supplier arrangements\u201d at food, drink and consumer goods manufacturers, as well as retailers. The ramp-up in regulatory activity comes after Tesco admitted it had artificially inflated profits by more than \u00a3263m as a result of the misstatement of payments from suppliers. The matter is currently being investigated by the Serious Fraud Office (SFO), the grocery market watchdog \u2013 the Groceries Code Adjudicator \u2013 and the FRC. Paul George, the FRC\u2019s executive director of conduct, said: \u201cEvents at Tesco did raise awareness of this issue but [the new regulatory focus] wasn\u2019t only as a result of Tesco. \u201cWe have been seeing over a period of time the complexity in arrangements between suppliers and their customers increasing.\u201d He said there were accounting and audit risks involved when relationships between suppliers and their clients evolved over time and this was not reflected in their original contracts. \u201cMore transparency is a good thing,\u201d George said. A \u201csignificant proportion\u201d of the 140 audits the FRC plans to inspect this year will be retailers and their suppliers, alongside other priority sectors including insurance, business services and companies servicing mining and oil companies, according to the body\u2019s annual report, which is published on Friday. The retail inspections will be separate from the FRC\u2019s investigation into Tesco\u2019s former auditor PwC and individuals within the retailer, in relation to the preparation, approval and audit of accounts going back to February 2012. George said he could not indicate when that investigation would be concluded. PwC, which was ousted as Tesco\u2019s auditor this year, and individual chartered accountants working for the supermarket could potentially face unlimited fines, legal costs and exclusion from the profession if the accountancy watchdog finds evidence of misconduct. Tesco has said it is cooperating fully with all the investigations it is facing. On Thursday, that led to speculation that the supermarket could be one of the first companies in the UK to strike a new type of deal with the SFO which would enable it to avoid a criminal prosecution. Under new powers introduced last year, the SFO can offer a \u201cdeferred prosecution agreement\u201d (DPA), a deal requiring high court approval, which includes fines and other undertakings if that is considered to be in the public interest and a company cooperates. A DPA deal does not protect individuals who might face criminal charges with the help of evidence provided by the company. In a speech last week, Ben Morgan, the SFO\u2019s joint head of bribery and corruption, said the watchdog had handed out its first invitation letters for companies to enter into DPA negotiations. Tesco and the SFO declined to comment on whether Tesco was among the companies to have been sent a letter. However, lawyers said such a deal could appeal to Tesco because it could bring about a settlement within months rather than the three to five years that a full SFO investigation entails. \u201cA DPA deal could bring about a much swifter resolution for Tesco,\u201d said Robert Amaee, a partner at law firm Covington and the former head of anti-corruption at the SFO. \u201cIf Tesco is one of the companies in settlement discussions with the SFO, it will have provided the SFO with evidence against senior individuals implicated in any alleged wrongdoing,\u201d he added. Meanwhile, Tesco\u2019s historic accountancy problems were highlighted again on Thursday when a US law firm said it had signed up a number of British institutional investors to pursue compensation for losses relating to the supermarket\u2019s profits overstatement. Tesco Shareholder Claims, which is supported by US law firm Scott and Scott, said it had also hired barrister Philip Marshall QC, one of the lawyers who acted for Paddy McKillen in his fight over Claridge\u2019s hotel with the Barclay brothers. The group said that, following advice from Marshall, it was \u201calready clear that the case against Tesco is strong and will involve a substantial claim\u201d. In Tesco\u2019s annual report released last week, the company said any legal action resulting from the SFO investigation or from legal action by shareholders \u201ccould have a material and adverse impact on the group\u2019s financial condition\u201d.",

The crash, he said, \u201cstarted with the government. The government pushed for non-qualified home ownership. The government clearly ... wanted everybody to fulfil their view of the American dream.\u201d To this point he added the aggravating factors of low interest rates and easy access to credit for homeowners. Credit bubble indicators were also plain to see, he suggested, in ballooning growth in GDP and in the private equity and hedge fund sectors. </p> <p>Among the highest-profile short-sellers to target Lehman in 2008 was the New York hedge fund Greenlight Capital, run by David Einhorn. At <a href=\"http://nymag.com/news/businessfinance/47844/\">a hedge fund conference in May 2008</a>, Einhorn had accused Fuld and his board of \u201caccounting ingenuity\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cHow did this happen? The answer is that the investment banks outmanoeuvred the watchdogs ... As a result, with no one watching, the managements of the investment banks did exactly what they were incentivised to do: maximise employee compensation.

More leverage means more revenues, which means more compensation.\u201d</p> <p>Einhorn is thought to have made substantial sums from bets on the downfall of Lehman.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p>",

The bank\u2019s failure sent shockwaves around the global economy and, in its wake, Fuld was summoned to appear before Congress for what turned out to be a bruising encounter. Referring to Fuld\u2019s pay, the chairman of the House oversight committee, Henry Waxman, said: \u201cYou made all this money taking risks with other people\u2019s money.\u201d Fuld told the Congress members: \u201cNot that anyone on this committee cares about this, but I wake up every single night wondering, \u2018What could I have done differently?\u2019 This is a pain that will stay with me for the rest of my life.\u201d In early 2008, short-sellers believed the bank was vulnerable, in large part due to its exposure to complex credit products it had built, known as collateralised debt obligations, or CDOs. Critics have suggested such products were an important contributor to the debt bubble. At the conference on Thursday, however, Fuld threw a different light on the causes of Lehman Brothers\u2019 downfall. The crash, he said, \u201cstarted with the government. The government pushed for non-qualified home ownership. The government clearly ... wanted everybody to fulfil their view of the American dream.\u201d To this point he added the aggravating factors of low interest rates and easy access to credit for homeowners. Credit bubble indicators were also plain to see, he suggested, in ballooning growth in GDP and in the private equity and hedge fund sectors. Among the highest-profile short-sellers to target Lehman in 2008 was the New York hedge fund Greenlight Capital, run by David Einhorn. At a hedge fund conference in May 2008, Einhorn had accused Fuld and his board of \u201caccounting ingenuity\u201d. \u201cHow did this happen? The answer is that the investment banks outmanoeuvred the watchdogs ... As a result, with no one watching, the managements of the investment banks did exactly what they were incentivised to do: maximise employee compensation. Investment banks pay out 50% of revenues as compensation. More leverage means more revenues, which means more compensation.\u201d Einhorn is thought to have made substantial sums from bets on the downfall of Lehman.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "For anyone who believes Greece should stick with the euro, her comments were ominous. Christine Lagarde, the boss of the International Monetary Fund, said Greece\u2019s exit from the eurozone is a possibility \u2013 but it would not signify an end to the single currency. Together, these statements show that while a Greek exit is not the preferred option, it is a realistic proposition for which plans have been made. The force of Lagarde\u2019s statement reveals the weakness of the stance taken by the radical leftist Syriza party, which governs Greece, in negotiations over the past four months. Whatever the rights and wrongs of the arguments over Athens\u2019 debt, and the prospects for growth while that debt weighs on the public finances, the country\u2019s major lenders \u2013 of which the IMF is the third largest \u2013 have tired of Syriza. And there is support from unlikely places. Portugal and Ireland, both run by right-of-centre coalitions, want Syriza to emerge empty-handed despite the prospect of cheaper credit that could follow a Brussels rethink. The governments in Dublin and Lisbon must soon face elections and want to defeat their own versions of Syriza. Spain is also an enemy of Athens now that the popularity of the People\u2019s party (PP) led by Mariano Rajoy has slumped and he faces defeat in an election later this year. Lagarde went on to say, in effect, that optimistic speeches by Greek ministers \u2013 and finance chief Yanis Varoufakis is a culprit in this instance \u2013 are so much hot air. Speaking at the G7 summit, she obviously felt comfortable issuing the warning, knowing that her supporters remain solid. Syriza\u2019s abject failure in garnering alternative funds \u2013 from the Russians in particular \u2013 has further weakened Athens\u2019 stance. It wasn\u2019t always the case. There have been times when senior officials in Brussels and the IMF have shown their sympathy for a country that must spend the next 42 years paying back an average of \u20ac10bn (\u00a37bn) a year to the IMF, the European Central Bank, the EU and each EU country that has made loans separately \u2013 not to mention the private sector creditors. They understand that Greece cannot repay loans at this level, especially when they are front-loaded with a \u20ac38bn repayment this year. But Lagarde wants Syriza to adopt her policies of austerity to create a budget surplus and refuses to accept anything less. The doubters in her own ranks appear to have been demoted or cast aside. In the next few days a capitulation of sorts by Syriza must be the result. With the cupboard bare, prime minister Alexis Tsipras must consider how to pay public sector wages and vital welfare payments. He will need all his political skill to present his defeat as a victory. Zero hours + zero bonus for those who flog trainers and themselves If we needed another example of the growing divide between young workers \u2013 most of them on short-term, flexible contracts \u2013 and those, usually older, who have secured a better deal, then look no further than Sports Direct. This not a story about the largesse enjoyed by the boss, Mike Ashley, who is well-known for his wealth. This is a more commonplace tale of those with skills and experience taking what is left on the table after the boss has taken his slice. Sports Direct is now justly infamous for its zero-hour contracts. Most of the 14,800 shop workers on zero-hours terms must accept the minimum wage and few fringe benefits. None of them will enjoy even a tiny fraction of the \u00a334m bonus pool that will be awarded to Sports Direct staff, it emerged on Thursday. This will go to 3,000 head office staff and shop managers. To some it will be equivalent to a lottery win. A number of longstanding staff gained \u00a3100,000 plus under the previous bonus scheme \u2013 the same people who qualify for pensions and sick leave when zero-hours staff do not. While it is true that many of the workers on zero hours are students who enjoy flexible working, as ministers in this and the last government have emphasised, it is worth saying again that zero hours consigns people with families to a hand-to-mouth existence where credit is more expensive, if not impossible to find. Ashley has failed to take the hint from countless stories by staff past and present that resentment is rife on the shopfloor. He could probably afford to ignore pleas for greater fairness in a post-crash world of plentiful labour and declining welfare payments. Finding staff over the next few years should prove more difficult given the tightening labour market, but the next wave of welfare cuts will probably give workers reason to have two or three part-time jobs, not just one. And this supply of cheap labour will allow him to generate the next batch of bonuses.",

    "webTitle": "Greece looks for political deal as creditors question progress - as it happened", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Time for a recap: Greece\u2019s top negotiator has predicted that political intervention will be needed to finally close a deal with creditors, as time continues to tick away. Euclid Tsakalotos told us today that the two sides are converging, but also criticised the International Monetar Fund for being \u201cvery very tough\u201d. In Athens, the Greek government has declared it hopes to get a deal by Sunday. But creditors have both questioned this optimism; the IMF is insisting on sweeping reforms and credible surplus targets, while the European Commission warns that more work must be done. In the last few minutes, Christine Lagarde warned that a deal is very unlikely to come soon. The European Central Bank piled more pressure on, saying that the financial markets could be rocked if the Greek crisis ends badly. Greece has loomed over a meeting of finance ministers and central bank chiefs in Dresden. Photos here and also here. Europe\u2019s markets ended the day in the red. That\u2019s probably all for tonight. Thanks for reading, and for all the excellent comments. See you tomorrow. GW More cold water -- Christine Lagarde has told the German newspaper Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung (FAZ) that there\u2019s little chance of a breakthrough by Sunday LAGARDE - IT IS \u201cVERY UNLIKELY\u201d THAT WE WILL GET A COMPREHENSIVE SOLUTION IN THE NEXT COUPLE OF DAYS ON GREECE - PAPER LAGARDE - AFTER POSITIVE SIGNALS FROM ATHENS 10 DAYS AGO, WE\u2019VE BEEN SOBERED IN THE LAST WEEK - PAPER LAGARDE - THERE IS STILL A LOT TO DO ON GREECE LAGARDE - RULES OUT FURTHER GRANTING FURTHER LOANS TO GREECE WITHOUT A CLEAN REFORM AGREEMENT - PAPER She\u2019s also suggested that Greece could potentially leave the euro: Here\u2019s some homework, class: Anyone caught telling Osborne where he can put his Budget can stay behind and clean the erasers... Concerns over Greece helped to push Europe\u2019s main stock indices mostly into the red. Trading just ended for the day with the German, French, Italian and Spanish markets all down. This cancels out Wednesday afternoon\u2019s rally after Greece claimed a deal was close. Shares on Wall Street are also down, but in London the FTSE 100 crept higher. Jasper Lawler of CMC Markets sums it up: It was a delayed reaction, but European stocks fell on Thursday once it had been fully determined from new official comments that Greece is still far apart from creditors over conditions for the country\u2019s bailout. Over in Athens the Greek finance minister Yanis Varoufakis appears to have doused the idea of Greece turning to BRIC countries for financial assistance anytime soon. Helena Smith reports Prime minister Alexis Tsipras may have been intrigued - and pleasantly surprised - when Russia\u2019s deputy finance minister Sergei Storchak invited Greece to become the sixth member of the BRICS Development Bank - but less a month later, the leftist-led government appears to have nixed any notion that Athens is seriously contemplating the offer. Addressing parliament today, the Greek finance minister firmly ruled out the possibility saying: \u201canyone who believes that the Development Bank can replace an agreement with the institutions [EU and IMF] does not know the economic reality of Greece. We are an indivisible part of the European Union. It is an issue [to be dealt with] in our family and we have to solve it in Europe.\u201d Varoufakis said of negotiations with the EU and IMF to keep the debt-stricken country afloat. \u201cAll our other relations with Russia, China, the USA, Singapore or Japan will develop based on interest but we won\u2019t find a solution to negotiations outside European institutions and the European family,\u201d. Varoufakis\u2019 intervention draws a line under one of the odder episodes of the debt crisis. Storchak, who heads the New Development Bank, made the offer during a telephone conversation with Tsipras. Shortly after, Tsipras\u2019 anti-austerity coalition appointed former IMF representative Panagiotis Roumeliotis to examine whether Greece should indeed take it seriously. Operated by Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa, the New Development Bank is seen as an alternative to the Wold Bank and International Monetary Fund. Established with the express aim of facilitating financial cooperation among the five emerging markets, some in Athens had wondered whether it could possibly replace Greece\u2019s traditional reliance on Europe as doubts over the country\u2019s ability to stay in single currency also grew. Finance ministers at the G7 in Dresden have discussed the case for making structural reforms now, according to a member of the German delegation. Via Reuters: GERMAN G7 DELEGATION SOURCE - G7 NOT CONCERNED BY RECENT VOLATILITY ON BOND MARKETS GERMAN G7 DELEGATION SOURCE - G7 AGREED VOLATILITY IS A CORRECTION FROM PREVIOUS PRICE MOVES, SHOULD NOT BE SEEN AS UNEXPECTED GERMAN G7 DELEGATION SOURCE - G7 PARTICIPANTS AGREED THAT HIGH DEBT, BE IT GOVT OR PRIVATE, COULD BE A BRAKE ON GROWTH GERMAN G7 DELEGATION SOURCE -SEVERAL PARTICIPANTS SAID NOW WAS THE BEST TIME FOR STRUCTURAL REFORMS Update: Has Germany ever felt that it wasn\u2019t a good time for structural reforms, a colleague asks..... A few more photos just landed from Dresden, including one showing ECB chief Mario Draghi in a cheerful mood: The International Monetary Fund has dumped another bucket of chilly water over the suggestion that a Greek compromise deal is imminent. Bloomberg is reporting that the Fund is sticking to its guns, insisting that Greece commits to \u2018credible\u2019 primary budget surplus targets and significant reforms. Greece\u2019s government, of course, strongly agrees that its debts need to be shrunk. But this enthusiasm isn\u2019t shared by eurozone governments and the European Central Bank, who own so much Greek debt between them. Greece\u2019s lead negotiator, Euclid Tsakalotos, has warned that it will take a \u201chigh-level\u201d political agreement to actually drive a deal though. Speaking to the Guardian from the Belgian capital, where the Brussels Group of technical teams will be resuming talks on Thursday, Tsakalotos told us: \u201cThe [two sides] will never converge completely but the general impression is that they are converging.\u201d And Tsakalotos, who is Greece\u2019s Deputy Foreign minister, believes that the final push must come from political leaders: \u201cThere is now a reasonable chance that whatever convergence still needs to be done after the Brussels Group will be done at a higher level where politicians will be called in for the final trade-off and will bridge the gap.\u201d Here\u2019s the full story, in which Tsakalotos also criticises the IMF for being \u201cvery, very tough\u201d and not really engaging with Greece\u2019s needs.... In Athens, protesters are holding an anti-austerity rally outside the Ministry of Employment - a sign of the domestic pressure the government faces to get a \u2018good\u2019 deal. The bomb threat that forced the evacuation of the Greek finance ministry this morning was a hoax: Over in America, the number of people signing on for unemployment benefit rose unexpectedly last week. A total of 282,000 people filed \u2018initial claims\u2019 for jobless welfare, up from 275,000 the previous week. And the \u2018continuing claims\u2019 total also rose, to 2.222 million from 2.211 million). That\u2019s pushed the US dollar down, while US Treasury prices (American government debt) are rising. Here\u2019s a list of Greece\u2019s looming debt repayments, and key eurozone meetings, from Deutsche Bank. It could be helpful for those of you under pressure to book some time off this summer.... Economists reckon there is a 30% chance that Greece will leave the eurozone this year, according to a Reuters poll of 70 City experts. Has Mark Carney taken an electric handshake buzzer to the G7? Everyone say k\u00e4se..... G7 finance ministers and central bank chiefs are posing for the traditional \u2018family photo\u2019 in Dresden right now. Once again, the European Commission has dampened Greece\u2019s rosy view of the situation. EC spokeswoman Annika Breidthardt is telling the daily Brussels press briefing that negotiators still have several \u201copen issues\u201d to address before a deal is reached. Further progress is needed in the talks..... We are not there yet. Here\u2019s a video clip from outside the Greek finance ministry, following today\u2019s bomb threat (thanks to Enikos) Greek media are reporting that the Athens finance ministry was evacuated this morning because of a bomb threat. Skai News says the ministry received a phone call this morning, saying an explosive device had been planted. According to To Vima, a bomb disposal unit has been dispatched to investigate the threat. Back at the G7, a cheerful-looking Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble is looking forward to a jammy dodger. Greek government spokesman Gabriel Sakellaridis is insisting that Athens is close to a deal with its creditors, and denied that finance minister Yanis Varoufakis could be replaced soon. Sakellaridis even claims that lenders are sounding pessimistic to pile more pressure on Greece to cave in on the areas where there isn\u2019t agreement. Reuters has the key points: GREEK GOVERNMENT SPOKESMAN SAYS GREEK NEGOTIATING TEAM AT BRUSSELS GROUP AIMS TO CLOSE DEAL HOPEFULLY BY SUNDAY GREEK GOVT SPOKESMAN SAYS DENIES ANY PLAN TO BUNDLE IMF PAYMENTS IN JUNE TO PAY IN ONE GO GREEK GOVT SPOKESMAN SAYS FINANCE MINISTER VAROUFAKIS HAS THE SUPPORT OF THE GOVT AND PM TSIPRAS GREEK GOVT SPOKESMAN SAYS STATEMENTS THAT DO NOT SHARE GREEK GOVT\u2019S OPTIMISM ON A DEAL ARE LINKED TO PRESSURING GOVT GREEK GOVT SPOKESMAN SAYS WE BELIEVE WE ARE NEAR A DEAL Greek bonds are strengthening in value, pushing down the yield on its shorter-term debt to slightly less dangerous levels. Greece\u2019s claim that it could get a deal by Sunday had prompted a certain amount of cynicism among financial experts: Newsflash from Athens -- Greece is hoping to close a deal by Sunday, \u2018hopefully\u2019. GREEK GOVERNMENT SPOKESMAN SAYS GREEK NEGOTIATING TEAM AT BRUSSELS GROUP AIMS TO CLOSE DEAL HOPEFULLY BY SUNDAY V\u00edtor Const\u00e2ncio went on to address the elephant in the room - what happens if Athens fails to repay \u20ac1.6bn to the International Monetary Fund in June? He says it would not automatically drive Greek banks into insolvency (so the ECB could keep helping) but it would force a reassessment of the Greek sovereign debt they own. If bank impairments rise, it could make it harder for Greek banks to hand over assets as collateral in return for emergency liquidity. Despite the lack of a Greek deal, the European Central Bank is working on the assumption that Greece won\u2019t crash out of the single currency. That\u2019s according to V\u00edtor Const\u00e2ncio, vice-president of the ECB, speaking in Frankfurt a few minute ago. Const\u00e2ncio also told reporters that Greek banks are still seen as solvent, which is why the ECB has been able to provide \u20ac114bn of emergency liquidity to prop them up. The European Central Bank has sounded the alarm over Greece\u2019s escalating crisis. In its new financial stability review, just published, the ECB warns default risk expectations have \u201cincreased sharply in Greece\u201d amid heightened political uncertainty. Here\u2019s the key section: Sovereign risks emanating from Greece, in particular, have increased sharply owing to heightened political uncertainty over the past six months, while the banking sector in Greece has witnessed substantial deposit outflows, a loss of access to the wholesale funding market and deteriorating asset quality. Financial market reactions to the developments in Greece have been muted to date, but in the absence of a quick agreement on structural implementation needs, the risk of an upward adjustment of the risk premia demanded on vulnerable euro area sovereigns could materialise. The report is online here (pdf), and packed full of charts showing the state of the euro economy. For example, this one shows just how badly the eurozone has lagged behind the US and the UK since the crisis blew up. Vulnerable countries are Spain, Italy, Portugal, Greece, Cyprus and Slovenia. Such divergent growth underlines the challenges of bundling 18 countries into a single currency union.... Economists had hoped that the ONS would raise its estimate of UK growth today, from 0.3% to 0.4%, but alas not. On a positive note, the ONS has decided that Britain\u2019s industrial sector grew by 0.1%, rather than shrinking by 0.1%. It also now believes that construction only contracted by 1.1%, not by 1.6%. But these improvements were wiped out by the downward revision to the services sector (from 0.5% to 0.4%). The ONS also warns that Britain\u2019s current account deficit was a drag; net trade knocked a chunky 0.9% of GDP growth in the last quarter. The UK economy grew by 0.3% in the first three months of 2015, according to the Office for National Statistics\u2019 second estimate. That\u2019s in line with the first estimate, released last month. The ONS also confirmed that UK GDP grew by 2.8% in 2014, compared with 2013. The ONS has revised down its estimate for UK service sector growth, but revised up its estimate of production and construction sector. Europe\u2019s stock markets have dropped in early trading, as traders fret about the lack of progress over Greece. Shares jumped yesterday, after Greek officials claimed a deal was close, but sceptical creditors have now dented the optimism: As Mike van Dulken of Accendo Markets comments: Greece\u2019s debt deadline is looming large and it remaining unclear whether an agreement can be reached. The Athens stock market is up 0.6% this morning, though, suggesting Greek investors are still upbeat. Finance ministers from the world\u2019s advanced nations, and the world\u2019s top central bank chief, are gathering in Dresden now to discuss the world economy. Here\u2019s some new photos: And here\u2019s British Chancellor of the Exchequer, George Osborne, speaks at a welcome reception at the Frauenkirche, or cathedral, last night. G7 finance chiefs need to work together, tweets UK chancellor George Osborne from Dresden: Back to the G7 meeting....and Christine Lagarde has told a German TV station that Greece and its lenders must keep working hard to get a deal. The head of the IMF says: \u201cWe are all in the process of working towards a solution for Greece and I would not say that we already have reached substantial results. \u201cThings have moved, but there is still a lot of work to do.\u201d That doesn\u2019t really match the optimism we keep hearing from Athens. But Lagarde did say she has a \u201cgood feeling\u201d that Greece will meets its commitments (including the \u20ac1.6bn it owes the Fund in June). Has the Chinese stock market bubble just started to burst? Shares in Shanghai have tumbled today, dragging the main index down by 6.5% by the close of trading. More than 1.2 trillion yuan of shares changed hands, which is an all-time record, according to Reuters data. The Shanghai Composite index has soared by over 140% in the last year, a quite remarkable rally. Analysts have been warning for months that small investors have been fuelling the boom, often with borrowed money. Financial news site Ransquawk says today\u2019s selloff was triggered by rumours that the Chinese central bank was trying to drain liquidity from the market. More here. There\u2019s a lot of talk about Lehman Brothers at the G7 meeting of finance ministers in Dresden, says Bloomberg\u2019s Hans Nichols. And that because those with long memories recall how the US investment bank was allowed to fail in September 2008, triggering the near-meltdown of financial system. America is particularly concerned that the Greek crisis could spiral out of control. As we covered yesterday, US Treasury secretary Jack Lew is warning European government that it\u2019s wrong to assume that a Greek default would be easily contained. Larry Summers, the top US economics professor and former US Treasury secretary, has urged eurozone leaders to compromise with Greece. He argues that Europeans \u201cneed to recognise there are limits\u201d to the amount of austerity that can be imposed on the Greek economy. Ultimately, debt problems are resolved by growth, not just by austerity. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. The world\u2019s top finance ministers are fretting about the Greek bailout, as pressure mounts on Athens and its creditors to reach a compromise deal. German finance chief Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble is hosting his counterparts from Britain, Canada, France, Italy, Japan and the United States in Dresden, at a two-day G7 meeting. Central bank chiefs are also there. Officially they\u2019re talking about the global economy and tax evasion; Greece isn\u2019t on the agenda, but there is no escape from it. The American delegation are expected to push hard for a compromise. Yesterday, we were treated to flurry of optimism from Greece, with prime minister Alexis Tsipras claiming that a deal was very close. That confidence, though, is not shared by its creditors. Last night, Sch\u00e4uble told German TV that talks really haven\u2019t progressed far, admitting he is \u201calso a bit surprised\u201d when hears the Greek government claiming a deal is imminent. Time really is running out now. Greece must pay June\u2019s public sector wages and pension bills in a few days, and then is expected to hand \u20ac305m to the International Monetary Fund a week tomorrow. Eurozone deputy finance ministers will assess the situation today, on a Euro Working Group teleconference. Athens must be hoping that the EWG see signs of progress..... Also coming up today... We also get a second estimate of Britain\u2019s economic growth in the first three months of this year, at 9.30am. Economists predict the growth rate could be raised from 0.3% to 0.4%. The latest eurozone economic confidence data is released at 10am BST. Weekly US jobless data is published at 1.30pm BST. And European stock markets are expected to be calm, as investors in the City are digesting financial results from DIY chain Kingfisher, and food group Tate &amp; Lyle.",

Storchak, who heads the New Development Bank, made the offer during a telephone conversation with Tsipras. Shortly after, Tsipras\u2019 anti-austerity coalition appointed former IMF representative Panagiotis Roumeliotis to examine whether Greece should indeed take it seriously.</p> <p>Operated by Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa, the New Development Bank is seen as an alternative to the Wold Bank and International Monetary Fund. Established with the express aim of facilitating financial cooperation among the five emerging markets, some in Athens had wondered whether it could possibly replace Greece\u2019s traditional reliance on Europe as doubts over the country\u2019s ability to stay in single currency also grew.<br></p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5567316ae4b0408ae911035a\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2015-05-28T15:29:37.038Z\">4.29pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Finance ministers at the G7 in Dresden have discussed the case for making structural reforms now, according to a member of the German delegation.</p> <p>Via Reuters:</p> <ul> <li>GERMAN G7 DELEGATION SOURCE - G7 NOT CONCERNED BY RECENT VOLATILITY ON BOND MARKETS <br></li> <li>GERMAN G7 DELEGATION SOURCE - G7 AGREED VOLATILITY IS A CORRECTION FROM PREVIOUS PRICE MOVES, SHOULD NOT BE SEEN AS UNEXPECTED</li> <li>GERMAN G7 DELEGATION SOURCE - G7 PARTICIPANTS AGREED THAT HIGH DEBT, BE IT GOVT OR PRIVATE, COULD BE A BRAKE ON GROWTH</li> <li>GERMAN G7 DELEGATION SOURCE -SEVERAL PARTICIPANTS SAID NOW WAS THE BEST TIME FOR STRUCTURAL REFORMS</li> </ul> <p><strong>Update:</strong> <em>Has Germany ever felt that it wasn\u2019t a good time for structural reforms, a colleague asks.....</em></p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2015-05-28T16:06:54.981Z\">at 5.06pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-55672b39e4b0408ae911034e\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2015-05-28T15:01:56.849Z\">4.01pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>A few more photos just landed from Dresden, including one showing ECB chief Mario Draghi in a cheerful mood:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9b13cd84515177f4de98edfbf3702bd82d5fe08f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9b13cd84515177f4de98edfbf3702bd82d5fe08f/0_0_3620_2296/1000.jpg\" alt=\"epa04772511 (L-R) Mario Draghi, President of the European Central Bank, and Pierre Moscovici, Economic and Monetary Affairs Commissioner of the European Union, and other participants attend the G7 Meeting of Finance Ministers in the Royal Palace in Dresden, Germany, 28 May 2015.

      "bodyText": "Network Rail workers are to stage two strikes next month after a fresh pay offer was rejected by union members. The Rail, Maritime and Transport (RMT) union has announced a 24-hour walkout from 5pm on 4 June and a 48-hour walkout from 5pm on 9 June. Striking workers \u2013 including signallers and maintenance staff \u2013 have also been requested not to work any overtime from 6 to 12 June. Network Rail said the threat of a national rail strike was \u201cunacceptable\u201d and warned that rail services would be severely affected. A planned bank holiday strike was cancelled after an improved pay offer from Network Rail. But union representatives have since decided the deal was not good enough. RMT said the latest pay proposals fell \u201cwell short of what is required to maintain the living standards and the working conditions for nearly 16,000 staff across Network Rail operations and maintenance\u201d.\u200e Union members employed by Network Rail voted in a ballot by 80% for strike action on a 60% turnout, RMT said. The union\u2019s general secretary, Mick Cash, said Network Rail generated profits of \u00a31bn last year and was paying out \u00a360m in bonuses to senior managers. RMT had \u201cno option but to move to a rolling programme of industrial action\u201d, Cash said. \u201cWe have a massive mandate for action which shows the anger of safety-critical staff across the rail network at attacks on their standards of living. \u201cThe blunt truth is that this dispute could be settled for a fraction of the money being handed out in senior manager bonuses and [compensation] to the train operators for not running services. That is a ludicrous situation which should never have been allowed to have arisen.\u201d Cash added that the RMT representatives were prepared to come back to the negotiating table if Network Rail improved its offer. Network Rail originally offered a four-year deal \u2013 \u00a3500 this year followed by three years of increases in line with RPI inflation. The new offer was for two years \u2013 a 1% rise this year and about 1.4% next year \u2013 with no compulsory redundancies for the duration of the agreement. Network Rail chief executive, Mark Carne, said: \u201cOur people know that there are ways to improve the way work is done. I have always said that if we work together to realise these benefits, there is the possibility to increase pay. \u201cWe are therefore ready to get around the table with whoever the RMT consider can speak on behalf of their members. It is clearly unacceptable for the RMT to massively disrupt the travelling public with strike action when we are ready to continue talks.\u201d The Transport Salaried Staffs Association (TSSA), which also suspended a bank holiday strike, will ballot its members on the new offer, with the result to be announced on 13 June. TSSA official Lorraine Ward said: \u201cWith the expected cuts in the public sector from the new Tory government, our members were as much concerned about job security as they were about pay. \u201cThis offer means there will be no compulsory redundancies at NR for at least the next two years. Given the current climate, we think this is a major advance.\u201d",

    "webTitle": "Three-quarters of supermarket chickens contaminated with campylobacter", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Nearly three-quarters of fresh chickens in supermarkets and butchers are contaminated with the potentially lethal food-poisoning bug campylobacter, according to the final results of a year-long testing programme published by the Food Standards Agency. The cumulative results for samples taken between February 2014 and February 2015 show that 73% of poultry is contaminated with the bacteria, and 19% of chickens are heavily contaminated. The survey found that 7% of packaging tested positive for campylobacter, meaning that it could easily cross-contaminate other fresh food in shoppers\u2019 baskets. Poisoning with campylobacter is the most common cause of foodborne illness in the UK, with chicken being the prime culprit. The bug can be killed by thorough cooking but each year in the UK 280,000 people are made sick by it, with many thousands being admitted to hospital as a result and around 100 people a year dying. Asda had the worst results across the year, with 80% of its chickens contaminated, 30% of them heavily contaminated, and 12% of its poultry packaging contaminated on the outside. None of the major retailers scored well and the FSA\u2019s category covering independent butchers. Aldi and Lidl had similar scores for contamination, with 77% of all birds on sale testing positive for the bug, 24% of them positive at the highest level and 7% of them carrying the bacteria on the outside of packaging. The chicken-processing sector is highly concentrated, with the vast majority of retail chickens in the UK slaughtered and packed by a handful of companies. The FSA decided to name and shame retailers individually after more than a decade of trying by other means to get the industry to clean up. The industry lobbied hard to try to stop the FSA publishing the results, and ministers and Downing Street applied pressure on the agency to back down from its commitment, arguing that it would cause a food scare and damage the industry. After a delay, the FSA went ahead with its naming strategy last November. Sales of fresh chicken dropped by 7% in the months afterwards. A Guardian undercover investigation last year added to pressure on the industry when it revealed high levels of contamination and poor hygiene at leading abattoirs, including birds that had been dropped on the floor being recycled into the food chain, and breakdowns in machinery leading to pileups of guts and high-risk material. The FSA strategy appears to have been vindicated by a flurry of measures announced by the industry to tackle campylobacter. These include stopping some of the cost-saving intensive farming practices that are thought to contribute to the spread of the bug and multimillion-pound investment in new technologies to kill it with extra sterilising processes in abattoirs. The FSA said it had not expected to see the results of these improvements in its first annual survey, since they were only implemented towards the end of the testing period, but it had seen results from samples collected later that showed progress. It singled out Marks &amp; Spencer, Morrisons, the Co-op and Waitrose for having these improvements already in place in its supply chain. Other retailers and their processors are still at the trial stage in their campylobacter control measures. Last week Asda announced it was trialling improvements with two main chicken suppliers, 2 Sisters and Faccenda Foods. Sainsbury\u2019s became the last of the leading supermarkets to announce measures to tackle campylobacter in its poultry. The consumer watchdog Which? called for urgent action. Its executive director, Richard Lloyd said: \u201cIt beggars belief that nearly three-quarters of chickens on sale in supermarkets are still infected with this potentially deadly bug and that no retailers have met the FSA\u2019s target levels. \u201cIt\u2019s encouraging that all supermarkets are publicly committed to tackling this bug, but we must now see this commitment turned into urgent action that makes chicken safe.\u201d",

    "webTitle": "Services output revised down as UK economic growth unchanged at 0.3%", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Official figures have confirmed that Britain\u2019s growth rate slowed to 0.3% in the first three months of the year after an improvement in construction output was offset by a slowdown in the services sector. The second estimate of GDP by the Office for National Statistics was expected to show that the halving of the UK\u2019s quarterly growth rate had been exaggerated and would be revised upwards. But a mild rebound in energy production and construction during the latter part of the quarter was wiped out by a 0.1 percentage point cut in services output from the previous estimate, pushing the largest sector\u2019s growth rate down to its lowest since 2012. The services sector growth dropped from 0.5% to 0.4%, well down on its 1% rate of expansion in the first quarter of last year. Most economists expect the economy to pick up during the rest of this year now the election is out of the way. Inflation and interest rates remain at historical lows and the jobs market remains buoyant. Yet the slowing rate of services growth will worry the Treasury, which has come to rely on high street spending and a return to health in the City to mask a flatlining of output in manufacturing. Unease among exporters about the outcome of a referendum to leave the EU could also hinder business investment, which rose 1.5% over the first quarter. Strikingly, net trade was one of the biggest drags on growth after a 0.9 percentage points dive. Vicky Redwood, the chief UK economist at Capital Economics, said the net trade figure was \u201chardly good news from a rebalancing point of view\u201d. She added: \u201cAnd the biggest positive contribution came from stockbuilding \u2013 up 0.5 percentage points \u2013 which is not generally considered a very sustainable source of growth.\u201d The ONS pointed out that neither construction nor manufacturing had rebounded from the financial crash to take output its previous peak. \u201cAlthough, there has been widespread growth across all major components of GDP since the start of 2013, the service industry remains the largest and steadiest contributor to overall economic growth, and is the only headline industry in which output has exceeded pre-downturn levels,\u201d it said. Redwood said the rise in investment was good news and that \u201clooking ahead, we remain optimistic that Q1\u2019s slowdown was just temporary and that the recovery is probably already back on track again\u201d. ONS chief economist Joe Grice said: \u201cToday\u2019s unchanged figure of 0.3% growth in GDP in the first quarter of 2015 reflects small upwards revisions to production and construction, offset by a downward revision to services. \u201cIt confirms the picture of somewhat weaker growth in the first quarter than in recent ones. But no single quarter\u2019s figures should be given undue weight.\u201d",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Kingfisher has sold a dozen of its B&amp;Q outlets to discounter B&amp;M, according to analysts, after another tough quarter for the DIY chain. Sales at B&amp;Q\u2019s UK and Irish outlets slid 1.5% in the 13 weeks to the end of May as sales of seasonal outdoor and building products dropped 4% compared to a strong period last year. \u201cWe have made a solid start to the year against strong comparatives,\u201d said chief executive V\u00e9ronique Laury, who said the volume of goods sold at B&amp;Q had risen despite the value of sales falling. She said Kingfisher had sold the leases of 14 of the 60 stores it wanted to offload in March this year. The company said two different national retailers had agreed to take on the stores over the next two years, but did not confirm their names. However, analysts suggested B&amp;M had bought a dozen of the stores. Tony Shiret, an analyst at BESI, said B&amp;M was the main buyer of the sites and suggested the fast-growing discounter chain could present a growing challenge to B&amp;Q. \u201cKingfisher management believes that B&amp;M is no real threat to B&amp;Q with a limited overlapping range. While true of the current majority of B&amp;M stores, the largest ones carry, in our view, a very credible range of DIY, low-end furniture and, to a lesser extent, garden products,\u201d Shiret wrote in a note. Both the UK\u2019s traditional DIY chains \u2013 B&amp;Q and Homebase \u2013 are closing dozens of stores amid changing shopping habits. DIY stores face competition from a growing number of specialist online rivals, such as Toolstation and Victoria Plumb, as well as discounters like B&amp;M, Home Bargains or even Lidl and Aldi. Many younger people lack the skills to put up shelves or tile the bathroom, and DIY has fallen out of fashion. Many prefer to hire professionals for painting and wallpapering so they can spend their own time on leisure activities or buying clothes. Kingfisher\u2019s quarterly sales figures, released on Thursday, echoed that trend. While sales at B&amp;Q were down, those at Screwfix, which is aimed at professional builders, soared almost 27%. The chain opened new outlets and extended ranges. That performance, and a sharp jump in sales in Russia of 38.9%, helped lift quarterly retail profits by 1.4%. Kingfisher said Russians were splashing out on expensive durables that would hold their value, such as kitchens, bathrooms and power tools \u201cin an uncertain market\u201d. In France \u2013 where the company trades as Castorama and Brico D\u00e9p\u00f4t \u2013 sales were up 0.4%, which the company attributed to a \u201csoft market\u201d. Laury, who took over the helm last September, insisted the year had started positively for Kingfisher. \u201cIn the UK, B&amp;Q continued to grow sales volumes and Screwfix delivered an excellent performance, opening its 400th store in May. In France, our businesses performed broadly in line with the market,\u201d she said. It emerged last December that the company was going to sell a 70% controlling interest in B&amp;Q China after finding it difficult to interest the country\u2019s middle class in home improvement. The company said on Thursday that the stake had been sold to a Chinese buyer for \u00a3140m. Meanwhile, B&amp;M\u2019s annual sales rose by 29.5% to \u00a31.65bn, helping to boost underlying pre-tax profits, which rose 55.7% to \u00a3135m in the year to 28 March. Last year, the group opened 52 stores in the UK and bought a stake in the German chain Jawoll, which has 49 stores. It said it expected to open 60 new outlets this year.",

      "bodyText": "The mining magnate Gina Rinehart\u2019s eldest daughter, Bianca, will take control of family trust \u2013 which is estimated to be valued at $4bn \u2013 after the family\u2019s long-running legal battle. Justice Paul Brereton made the order in the supreme court in Sydney on Thursday, saying Bianca had demonstrated the ability to robustly assert the rights of the trust against her mother and her company, Hancock Prospecting. He found she was better suited than any of the alternatives to administer the trust under the circumstances. He ordered her mother to deliver the trust documents to her. The trust\u2019s main asset is a 24% shareholding in Hancock Prospecting \u2013 the mineral exploration company founded by Gina Rinehart\u2019s late father, Lang Hancock. Bianca and her brother, John, had taken proceedings for the removal of their mother as trustee over alleged misconduct in agreeing to amendments to the constitution of Hancock Prospecting which affected the administration of the trust fund. The court ruled that Rinehart had not acted in breach of the trust in agreeing to the amendments but she agreed to resign from the position of trustee shortly before the hearing began, leaving the court to decide on the replacement. The written judgment noted that Bianca had \u201cdemonstrated the ability robustly to assert the rights of the trust against the former trustee and against HPPL [Hancock Prospecting Pty Ltd]\u201d. It also stated that Bianca was prepared to \u201caccept any conditions that the court might impose\u201d and that while her status as a beneficiary presented some risk of conflict of interest and duty, \u201cthe risks are remote and can be sufficiently mitigated\u201d. The court noted that Bianca was better suited than any of the alternatives to administer the trust \u201cin the prevailing circumstances\u201d. In handing down his decision, Justice Brereton said it had become clear throughout the proceedings that Gina Rinehart had \u201cgone to extraordinary lengths\u201d to maintain control directly or indirectly of the trust. And she had exerted \u201cenormous pressure and great influence to do so\u201d. He said it was a reasonable inference that she would try to influence any trustee who tried to move against her interests. Any objections Gina\u2019s youngest daughter, Ginia \u2013 who has supported her mother throughout the proceedings \u2013 had to Bianca taking over the trust had not been made, he said. The ruling comes almost four years after the bitter supreme court battle began when Gina\u2019s three eldest children \u2013 John Hancock, Bianca Rinehart and Hope Welker \u2013oined in a claim against their mother to oust her as head of the Hope Margaret Hancock trust. The claim, launched in September 2011, alleged their mother had acted \u201cdeceitfully\u201d and with \u201cgross dishonesty\u201d in her dealings with the trust, set up in 1988 by her father, Lang Hancock, with her children as the beneficiaries. The court previously heard had Rinehart contacted her three elder children in early September 2011, days before Ginia turned 25, which was when the trust was due to vest. She had changed the vesting date to 2068. She warned her children the vesting of the trust on Ginia\u2019s birthday would have rendered them liable for substantial capital gains tax and would lead to their bankruptcy. They claimed this had been an attempt to mislead them. Rinehart has always denied the claims. As the battle wore on, the arguments were varied and many. There were pushes by the magnate to have the matter dealt with behind closed doors, as well as the airing of emails in which the siblings took swipes at each other and their mother.",

      "bodyText": "After last year\u2019s horror budget, which mired the government in poor opinion polls, this year\u2019s budget sought to address that issue. While recent research suggests low income earners remain the hardest hit, a report by the Organisation of Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) argues that lowering inequality improves economic growth and measures, such as the government\u2019s increased spending on childcare, is the best way to both lower inequality while fostering economic growth. The standard canard by those who argue that all the fuss about economic inequality is overrated, is that it is better to have economic growth rather than sacrifice growth for equality. They argue that a rising tide lifts all boats and thus it is better to focus on economic growth rather than inequality. But the OECD report, In it together: Why less inequality benefits us all, released last week, confirms the International Monetary Fund study from last year that inequality is actually harmful to economic growth. The OECD study goes even further and suggests that \u201cwhen income inequality rises, economic growth falls\u201d. It also found that the real negative impact of income equality came not so much from when average income earners fell well below the richest, but when the bottom 40% of income earners lag well behind the average earners. The good news for Australia is that compared to the rest of the OECD we are doing quite well on equality. Unlike a majority of nations in the OECD, Australia\u2019s inequality during the global financial crisis (GFC) actually decreased. During the 1990s, inequality in Australia rose in line with the average of the OED, but the mining boom from 2004 to 2008 it increased faster than the rest of the OECD. As I have noted previously, Australia came out of the GFC more equal than when it entered. Among the reasons for this were our comparative small rise in unemployment, the large increase in pensions in 2009, as well as the decline in income of the wealthiest partly due to falls in the share market: While this might suggest that improved equality assisted economic growth, equality also improved in the UK at the same time it suffered dreadfully during the GFC and the recession which followed. But the differences behind Australia and the UK\u2019s improvements in equality since 2007 is rather telling. From 2007 to 2011, the income of the poorest 10% of households in Australia increased by 2%, while incomes of the top 10% declined by 1%. But in the UK, the average household disposable income for the poorest 10% fell by 6%, compared with the top tenth falling by 11%. In the UK, the receding tide dropped all boats. While income equality improved for the UK during the GFC, wealth equality regressed. The OECD notes that in the UK the GFC \u201cexacerbated the concentration of wealth at the top\u201d. It found \u201cwhile on average net wealth has declined since 2007, the net wealth of the top percentiles has increased\u201d. In Australia, the wealth inequality is less than the average in the OECD, and certainly well below the US. In the US the top 10% hold 75% of the total wealth in the nation, in Australia, the richest 10% hold only 44.9% \u2013 below the OECD average of 50%: That Australia is doing better than the OECD average is worth celebrating but also requires vigilance. The OECD found that rising inequality has flow-on effects that become a perpetuating circle. For example, it noted that the wider the income inequality, \u201cthe lower is the chance that low-income households invest in education\u201d. This matters because lower educated people are found to be employed in \u201cnon-standard\u201d employment such as part-time or full-time contract work. Standard employment is defined a full-time permanent work, which despite increases in part-time work, remains the most common form of employment here in Australia and around the OECD. The OECD found that, on average, non-standard work tends to pay lower wages than standard jobs, especially at the bottom of the earnings distribution. The incidence of non-standard work can thus be a major driver of income inequality. Australia does have a higher incidence of non-standard work than most of the OECD, but unlike other nations there is almost no \u201cwage penalty\u201d compared with full-time permanent workers. Whereas in other countries part-time and casual workers can receive significantly lower rates than full-time workers in the same jobs, the OECD found in Australia there is little difference between the hourly pay rates of standard and non-standard workers when taking into account the experience of workers with similar job characteristics. But while this would suggest there is no problem working in non-standard jobs, because such work involves fewer hours, it means the total income of part-time or casual workers is much less \u2013 and the risks of being in poverty are much higher. In Australia 2.1% of standard workers live in poverty compared to 14% of \u201cnon-standard workers\u201d. Both levels, however, are much better than the OECD average: But where Australia does fall down in a great heap is jobless poverty rates \u2013 at 53.5% it is the second worst nation recorded by the OECD. It certainly supports the notion that both major parties in this country believe, as Tony Abbott said on Monday in parliament, \u201cthe best form of welfare is work\u201d . Certainly, under former ALP and current Coalition governments since 2007, there has been little joy for those forced onto Newstart. The report also knocked on the head the notion that redistribution of national income through income taxes and cash benefits harms growth. In the case of the US, it actually recommended that tax rates on \u201ctop earners\u201d are raised, tax compliance improved and \u201cregressive tax deductions\u201d eliminated or scaled back. Such advice would sit well with those arguing Australia superannuation tax concessions should also be wound back. But the report also suggests economic growth benefits more from improving inequality by increasing the income of the lowest 10% relative to average income, rather than attempting to reduce the gap between average earners and the wealthiest 10%. The report estimates that if inequality in the UK was improved to the level that exists in France, or if inequality in the United States was improved to the level that exists in Australia, their annual GDP growth would increase by nearly 0.3 percentage points over 25 years. This would mean in 25 years their economy would be 7% bigger than it otherwise would have been. But how should we improve this \u201cbottom inequality\u201d, to use the OECD\u2019s term. Rather than just use cash transfers through increasing welfare payments \u2013 even though this is necessary when the jobless in Australia are so firmly entrenched in poverty \u2013 the OECD recommends spending on longer-term social investment that fosters \u201cupward mobility and creates greater equality of opportunity in the long run\u201d. Among such programs are people who have access to \u201chigh-quality childcare and education or access to health or housing.\u201d Thus the budget\u2019s focus on childcare certainly gets a tick, though the government\u2019s cuts to education and health that remain from last year\u2019s budget rather negate any benefit. And benefit it is. The OECD report highlights that improving the poorest incomes boosts economic growth of all. It shows that inequality is, not just the political problem Joe Hockey found last year, but an economic one as well, and one that should be at the forefront of the treasurer\u2019s mind.",
