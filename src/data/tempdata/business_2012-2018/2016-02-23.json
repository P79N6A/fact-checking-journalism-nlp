Tax treaties are legal agreements between two countries on how each can tax capital flowing from one jurisdiction to another. In theory they are established to prevent double taxation \u2013 where income is taxed in two jurisdictions \u2013 but in practice many agreements limit the tax poorer nations can place on companies doing business within their borders. Since 1970 the UK has signed a number of treaties with developing African and Asian countries, 13 of which severely restrict their ability to tax foreign companies operating in their country through corporation tax, withholding tax on dividends and capital gains tax. This is among the highest number of harmful treaties signed by any country since 1970 according to ActionAid\u2019s research. \u201cThe global web of tax treaties is tying the hands of governments and severely limiting the ability of poor countries to tax global companies. It\u2019s deeply concerning that the UK his one of the countries with the largest number of harmful tax treaties which make it possible for multinational companies to slash their tax bills in poor countries,\u201d Savior Mwambwa, ActionAid tax campaign manager said. Based on ActionAid\u2019s data the Guardian has found 21 treaties between developed and developing countries that limit the maximum withholding tax rate on dividends at 0% and a further 114 treaties that limit the maximum withholding tax rate on dividends leaving a developing country to 5%. According to business databases, the Guardian has identified at least 1,500 companies based in developing countries that have a US or Europe-based parent that are able limit their tax rate on dividends to 5%. The structures, which are completely legal under the treaties, allow companies to avoid taxes on dividends earned from activity in a developing country. That income is then routed back to parent companies in developed nations, where tax rates are often much higher. In some cases the treaties can lead to double non-taxation, where profits are untaxed in either country. In the case of a 0% tax rate, companies can send profits derived from their businesses in a developing country to a parent company in an OECD or G20 nation, paying no tax as it leaves the country. It is then up to the parent country to tax the income. The current UK treaty with Gambia has a 0% withholding tax rate on dividends paid to a UK company. There are also a number of colonial era tax treaties between the UK and its former colonies still in operation. An agreement between Malawi and the UK signed in 1955 while the African nation was under colonial rule is still in operation today. The treaty states that companies operating in Malawi, which are owned by a UK parent, can send dividends back to their home country untaxed.",

The duo\u2019s first set of merger talks, way back in 2000, created a storm when both parties appeared to suggest that share prices in London would soon be quoted in freshly-minted euros. This time, the negotiations come at the start of the UK referendum campaign in which the prime minister has claimed the City of London will be safe from continental meddlers. Cue, almost certainly, wails of anguish from some quarters about the potential loss of a great British institution. No wonder LSE and Deutsche tried to invoke visions of happy European harmony with their talk of \u201ca merger of equals.\u201d As it happens, the shadow of Brexit will probably make no difference whatsoever. Consolidation has been a fact of life in the stock exchange game. The LSE \u2013 with a French chief executive, by the way \u2013 swallowed the Italian bourse years ago to little fuss in Milan. Instead, this deal faces two stiffer obstacles. Would the LSE be selling itself too cheaply? And is the proposed partnership anti-competitive in nature? First, the takeover price. True mergers of equals are almost as rare as unicorns. Somebody has to be in the driving seat. In this deal, Deutshe\u2019s shareholders would receive a 54.4% stake, a mechanical translation from the two companies\u2019 average share prices over the past three months. Why should LSE\u2019s shareholders settle for that? If either of the big US exchanges \u2013 Nasdaq or NYSE Euronext \u2013 wants to play, LSE shareholders will want to see their best offers. Then there is possible interest from Asian exchanges, who may sense their last chance to enter the European industry. Second, on competition, it\u2019s hard to understand how customers are supposed to benefit. The would-be partners will, no doubt, offer soothing words about how deeper trading pools create keener pricing to the ultimate benefit of all investors. Well, yes, but when any product is supplied by a large and dominant operator there is the potential for price-gouging. Quoted companies will worry that the costs of listing will only increase. The LSE is not noted for its generosity on fees, which is one reason why its shares (400p in 2009; \u00a326 now) have been a terrific investment. Put simply, this proposed Anglo-German alliance is a long way from being a done deal. Standard Chartered paying for its arrogance You remember Standard Chartered? It\u2019s the Asian-focused lender that was terribly pleased with itself for getting through the great financial crisis of 2007-09 with barely a scratch. It\u2019s the bank that recorded a tenth year of increased profits in 2012 and whose chairman, then and now, declared that \u201cStandard Chartered remains a growth story.\u201d Sir John Peace was wrong. The decade of plenty has been followed by three leaner years, culminating in Tuesday\u2019s shocker \u2013 a first loss since 1989. Beneath the usual parade of loan impairments, provisions and job losses, the source of the woe seems very simple: Standard Chartered really did believe in its own specialness and ability to join the big league of lenders. In plain English, it was old-fashioned arrogance that prompted the bank to dish out huge loans to Asian commodity billionaires who may now be struggling to maintain that status. The new \u201cliquidation portfolio\u201d represents 3% of the group\u2019s loans and advances to customers, which doesn\u2019t sound much in percentage terms but is enough to do serious damage to a bank. The underlying loan impairment of $4bn (\u00a32.9bn) in 2015 rose 87%, with 40% related to \u201ca number of exposures beyond our tightened risk tolerance\u201d, to use new chief executive Bill Winters\u2019 coy phrase. In the circumstances, Winters\u2019 attempt to recoup bonuses from 150 current and former staff is entirely correct. Somewhere along the line, basic principles of risk-management seem to have been lost. For his part, Peace, before he finally departs, could do his shareholders a service by giving his explanation of how it all went wrong. Even in the banking business, a three-year fall in the share price from \u00a317 to \u00a34 is going some. Mine the gap The bonfire of the big miners\u2019 dividends is complete. BHP Billiton, the biggest of the bunch, has abandoned its \u201cprogressive\u201d \u2013 meaning upwards only \u2013 policy. The half-year payment is being slashed 74% and, from now on, BHP guarantees only to pay out 50% of underlying earnings and then see if it can spare a few quid on top. Rio Tinto performed a similar retreat a couple of weeks ago and no investor can be surprised that BHP has followed. The era of \u201cstronger for longer\u201d commodity prices ended at least two years ago and nobody expects it to return soon. If only for the sake of appearances, BHP should have cut its dividend last November after the dam disaster at Samarco, a joint venture in Brazil, that killed 17 people and left two still unaccounted for. In fact, the mystery is why chief executive Andrew Mackenzie and chairman Jac Nasser got so hung up about progressive dividends as recently as last August. Even pre-Samarco, the stance looked hubristic. BHP\u2019s earnings per share had just collapsed to 36 cents but the company was clinging to a dividend of $1.24 a share, costing $6.5bn. The mismatch looked like a triumph of hope over experience, and so it has proved as commodity prices have continued to fall. The net loss for the latest half-year was $5.7bn, hit also by a write-off of the value of the Samarco investment. Consider the new dividend policy, then, an overdue acceptance of commonsense. The prices of iron ore, copper, coal and oil \u2013 BHP\u2019s big four products \u2013 are all down between 20% and 50% on a year ago, demonstrating that mining is a feast-or-famine business. The dividend should be set to accept that reality.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The London Stock Exchange and Germany\u2019s Deutsche B\u00f6rse are in talks about a \u00a321bn merger, in a move likely to be closely monitored by politicians in the run-up to the referendum on the UK\u2019s membership of the EU. In their third attempt at a tie-up, the two exchanges are aiming to unite to create a European powerhouse of trading in stocks, bonds and complex financial instruments to take on rivals in the US and Asia. The pair were forced to admit they were in talks on Tuesday after news of their discussions leaked. They said they were embarking on a \u201cmerger of equals\u201d in which both companies would share control of the boardroom and retain their separate brands. However, Deutsche B\u00f6rse would own 54.4% of the merged holding company, compared with LSE\u2019s 45.6%, which appears to favour the Frankfurt stock exchange. LSE\u2019s shares, which are listed on its own market after it took the step 15 years ago to demutualise, initially jumped 17% to \u00a327.06, valuing it at about \u00a39.5bn, before closing 13% higher at \u00a326.30. Deutsche B\u00f6rse raced up 7% to \u20ac81.71, giving it a value of almost \u00a312bn, before paring gains to end 3% higher. News of the putative merger leaking within days of David Cameron announcing the 23 June date for the referendum on EU membership could add a political element to a deal being agreed. John Mann, the Labour MP, described the timing as \u201cinteresting in the context of the referendum\u201d. \u201cWould UK politicians be happy with the main UK exchange being owned by a foreign entity?\u201d asked Jonathan Goslin, an analyst at stock brokers Numis. \u201cWhile we see the obvious benefits from such a deal \u2013 namely cost and revenue synergies \u2013 we remain mindful of the challenges that would need to be overcome for it to complete.\u201d If an agreement could be reached it would mark another chapter in the complex history of the LSEx, which can trace its roots back to 1760 when a group of traders began to trade shares in Jonathan\u2019s Coffee House in the City. It has expanded beyond trading stocks and shares in London and into owning the Italian stock market and a major stake in a clearing house which operates behind-the-scenes business to guarantee billions of pounds of trading. It tried, but failed, to merge with an exchange in Toronto four years ago. Goslin said a number of hurdles stand in the way completion, including potential questions from the competition authorities which blocked a deal between Deutsche B\u00f6rse and the NYSE Euronext in 2012. Regulatory approval would also be needed by the two major City regulators, the Financial Conduct Authority and the Bank of England, to ensure the enlarged entity was properly managed. Neither would comment, although a government spokesperson said: \u201cThe government is aware of the London Stock Exchange\u2019s announcement this afternoon that its board has entered detailed discussions with the management board of Deutsche B\u00f6rse about a potential merger of equals of the two businesses.

      "bodyText": "A slide in the oil price as Saudi Arabia seemed to rule out hopes of production cuts sent stock markets sharply lower again after Monday\u2019s rally. Brent crude is currently nearly 4% lower at $33.32, while West Texas Intermediate is down almost 5%. Meanwhile the pound continued to come under pressure on Brexit fears, falling to $1.4022. Commodity companies were among the day\u2019s big fallers, on renewed concerns about a slowdown in China and news that BHP Billiton was slashing its dividend. Standard Chartered was also a big faller, down nearly 7% after reporting its first loss in 26 years amid worries about its exposure to emerging markets. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished 75.42 points or 1.25% lower at 5962.31, despite a near 14% rise in London Stock Exchange shares on news of a proposed merger with Deutsche B\u00f6rse Germany\u2019s Dax dropped 1.64% to 9416.77 France\u2019s Cac closed down 1.4% at 4238.42 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB fell 1.95% to 17,163.46 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended 1.42% lower at 8267.6 In Greece, the Athens market added 1.2% to 493.97 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 178 points or just over 1%. On that note, it\u2019s time to close for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. Sterling has hit a new seven year low against the dollar of $1.4044, following Bank of England governor Mark Carney\u2019s comments suggesting UK interest rates could be cut. The UK currency has also come under renewed pressure on the uncertainty over the forthcoming referendum on whether Britain should leave the European Union, which Carney also referred to. Crude continues to weaken as Saudi oil minister Ali Al-Naimi suggested production cuts were not on the cards. He told a conference in Houston that cutting production would not happen, but major producers would freeze output to help the market rebalance. Saudi Arabia and Russia recently agreed to freeze output at January levels in an effort to deal with the supply glut which has sent crude prices tumbling. He said in Houston that he hoped there would be more agreements on freezing in March, when more meetings will be held. He said \u201cmost of the countries that count\u201d would freeze, according to Reuters. Earlier Iran had apparently dismissed the proposal as ridiculous, despite the country seeming to support it last week. Al-Naimi said the price rout would ease although he did not know when. And he added that he was not banking on cuts \u201cbecause there is less trust than usual\u201d, said Reuters. Brent is currently down 3% at $33.62 a barrel while West Texas Intermediate - the US benchmark - is 4% lower at $32.03. Jasper Lawler at CMC Markets said: Oil prices turned lower after the Iranian oil minister\u2019s colourful description of the output freeze between Russia and Saudi Arabia as \u201cridiculous.\u201d Iran and its plans to ramp up output after the lifting of sanctions is proving a thorn in the side of other producing counties which appear to be reaching consensus that production should stay at current levels. Tensions are clearly rising in the cartel as the Saudi oil minister reposted that \u201cnot all the countries will freeze. The ones that count will.\u201d The day\u2019s confidence figures show how fragile sentiment is at the moment, says analyst Connor Campbell at Spreadex: Whilst the [US] existing home sales figure actually saw a mild increase month-on-month, from 5.45 million to 5.47 million, more notable was the sharp decline in the CB consumer confidence number. Coming in at 92.2 against the 97.4 last month the figure, like this morning\u2019s year-low German Ifo business climate data, highlights just how entrenched the market\u2019s current fears are, despite the sporadic surges that have taken the global indices to a variety of recent highs. There was to be no such surge this afternoon, however, the Dow Jones dropping over 100 in light of that literal knock to the index\u2019s confidence. Over in the UK the FTSE fell past its earlier lows as the afternoon progressed, declining around 50 points to trickle underneath the 6000 mark following the weak US open, a drop exacerbated by Brent Crude slipping under $34 per barrel once again. Back with the London Stock Exchange, and analysts at Numis point to a number of problems facing its proposed merger with Deutsche B\u00f6rse: This represents the third time the LSE and DB have attempted to merge, first in 2000 then in 2004. Although no details were given, a merger is expected to provide enhanced growth, significant customer benefits as well as substantial revenue and cost synergies. However, we see a number of challenges in completing this deal, namely: (1) the competition authority is likely to ask a number of questions as it would create a dominant player in exchanges and clearing in Europe \u2013 the EC blocked a similar deal between Deutsche B\u00f6rse and NYSE Euronext in 2012 citing competition concerns; (2) both have differing views on how to structure their respective clearing businesses \u2013 LSE backs open access (i.e. trading and clearing can occur on different platforms) whereas DB does not; (3) national pride \u2013 would UK politicians be happy with the main UK exchange being owned by a foreign entity. So whilst we see the obvious benefits from such a deal (namely cost and revenue synergies), we remain mindful of the challenges that would need to be overcome for it to complete. The Richmond manufacturing index has also disappointed, coming in at -4 compared to the 2 which analysts had been looking for. However US existing home sales have beaten expectations, up 0.4% in January compared to a forecast fall of 2.5%. US consumer confidence figures for February have come in much lower than expected, as the recent market volatility outweighs the benefits of cheaper oil. The index fell from 97.8 in January - itself revised down from 98.1 - to 92.2. Analysts had been expecting a figure of 97. This is the lowest level since July. Dennis de Jong, managing director at UFX.com, said Despite relatively healthy numbers over recent months, onlookers will be concerned with the worrying dip in this month\u2019s consumer confidence data. It\u2019s surprising that US shoppers have kept their wallets in their pockets for another month, especially considering that low gas prices continue to help them save. While the slip may have a short-term negative affect on the US Dollar, if gas continues to stay low, it\u2019s only a matter of time before US consumers get the spending bug again. Meanwhile US stock markets have opened lower, in line with the dips on European exchanges. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 40 points or 0.2% after another fall in oil prices - West Texas Intermediate is around 2% lower after a report Iran\u2019s oil minister called the proposed output freeze ridiculous. At the open the S&amp;P 500 is 0.3% lower and Nasdaq down 0.4%, ahead of the latest US consumer confidence figures. Back in Europe the FTSE 100 is currently down 22 points or 0.3%, but would be another 4 points or so lower if not for the 16% jump in the shares of the London Stock Exchange. It was not always so friendly between the LSE and Deutsche B\u00f6rse: And here\u2019s the BBC\u2019s story from the time. Here\u2019s our first take on the LSE-Deutsche B\u00f6rse merger plan: The London Stock Exchange is in talks to merge with Germany\u2019s Deutsche B\u00f6rse in a deal that would seal an alliance first discussed at the turn of the millennium. The LSE confirmed on Tuesday it was in detailed discussions with its German rival about an all-share merger. Under the proposed structure, Deutsche B\u00f6rse shareholders would own 54.4% of the combined company and LSE shareholders would hold 45.6%. The UK exchange said: \u201cThe boards believe that the potential merger would represent a compelling opportunity for both companies to strengthen each other in an industry-defining combination, creating a leading European-based global markets infrastructure group.\u201d The exchanges have considered combining forces before. They agreed to merge in 2000 before a rival bid for the LSE from Sweden\u2019s OM Gruppen scuppered the deal, but was then rejected. The LSE then rejected a formal \u00a31.3bn offer from Deutsche B\u00f6rse in January 2005. The full story is here: David Cheetham of City trading firm XTB.com says a merger between the LSE and Deutsche Borse would create one of the world\u2019s biggest financial trading platforms. \u201cShares in London Stock Exchange Group have soared by over 17% in the past hour as news that they\u2019re in talks with Deutsche Boerse have been confirmed. If the deal were to go ahead it would create a clear market leader for European and one of the largest exchanges in the world for trading and risk managing derivatives. The timing of this development appears coincidental as the possibility of a Brexit has become increased in recent days now that a referendum date has been set and Boris has joined the Out campaign.\u201d The news that Britain\u2019s stock exchange could soon merge with its German rival has startled the City, especially given the upcoming EU vote. Mike van Dulken, head of research at Accendo Markets, tweets: It\u2019s official! The London Stock Exchange has just confirmed that it is talking to Deutsche B\u00f6rse about a merger deal. It says: Further to the recent movement in LSE\u2019s share price, the Board of LSE and the Management Board of Deutsche B\u00f6rse confirm that they are in detailed discussions about a potential merger of equals of the two businesses. This would create \u201ca leading European-based global markets infrastructure group\u201d, it claims, adding: The combination of LSE and Deutsche Boerse\u2019s complementary growth strategies, products, services and geographic footprint would be expected to deliver an enhanced ability to provide a full service offering to customers on a global basis. Under the plan, Deutsche B\u00f6rse shareholders would hold 54.4% of the new company, while LSE shareholders would hold 45.6%. The LSE\u2019s shares are now up 17%, valuing the group at almost \u00a39.5bn. Deutsche B\u00f6rse shares have also jumped, by around 3%, following the reports of merger talks with Britain\u2019s LSE. And Euronext, another stock market operator, has seen its shares rally by 4%. Investors may be anticipating a bidding war. Here\u2019s the Reuters story that sparked the move: BREAKING: Takeover speculation has just driven shares in the London Stock Exchange up by 9%, to the top of the FTSE 100 leaderboard. It has been trigger by a Reuters report, that the LSE is in talks over a possible merger with German rival Deutsche B\u00f6rse. Nothing official yet, though. More than a decade ago, the LSE rejected Deutsche B\u00f6rse\u2019s advances.... The timing of these talks is quite intriguing, given the uncertainty which the EU referendum is casting over the City.... Analysts at Scotia Bank have predicted that the UK pound could slump to just $1.30 if the Out campaign win June\u2019s vote. That would be its lowest level in around 30 years, worse than the selloff after the 2008 financial crisis. They have also suggested that consumer confidence would be badly hit, as economic growth slowed sharply.. Sterling is dropping back towards the seven year low it struck on Monday. The pound has lost half a cent against the US dollar, dipping below the $1.41 mark. Yesterday, it weakened to $1.4057, before a late revival. Mark Carney\u2019s warning that investors are protecting themselves against future sterling weakness (details here) may have reminded traders that we face months of uncertainty. Dominic Stewart, sales trader at ETX Capital, says: Sterling has remained vulnerable after falling nearly 2% yesterday - its biggest one day drop in almost six years - amidst fears that Britain may leave the European Union. The Treasury Committee session is now over, and Mark Carney and colleagues have been released back into the wild. But if you want more EU referendum action, check out our Politics Live blog. Andy Sparrow is on deck, covering a speech from David Cameron right now: Cameron: EU referendum is a \u2018once in a generation\u2019 decision - Politics live Guardian readers have known for a while that the Bank of England was working on contingency plans for the EU referendum. Back in May 2015, the Bank of England accidentally emailed us the details of Project Bookend, including how to deny it existed. #oops We wrote at the time that: The email indicates that a small group of senior staff are to examine the effect of a Brexit under the authority of Sir Jon Cunliffe, who as deputy director for financial stability has responsibility for monitoring the risk of another market crash. Cunliffe also sits on the board of the City regulator, the Prudential Regulatory Authority. James Talbot, the head of the monetary assessment and strategy division, is involved in Project Bookend, drawing on his past work as an adviser on European economic policy. The Bank of England is engaged in contingency planning for the EU referendum, Mark Carney tells the Treasury committee. He also reveals that the Prudential Regulation Authority is keeping abreast of the contingency plans that UK banks are making ahead of the June 23 vote. Further details will discussed on March 8, when the governor testifies to the committee specifically about the referendum. [The PRA supervises Britain\u2019s financial sector, to ensure they are \u201csafe and sound\u201d, so they will be keen to avoid any firms being caught out by the referendum]. Rachel Reeves MP asks Mark Carney whether he expects the recent falls in sterling to continue. The governor reiterates that investors have been buying downside protection to protect themselves against falls against the pound, especially against the US dollar [rather than the euro, because it could also suffer if Britain leaves the EU]. Governor Carney concludes: It is safe to say that an element of referendum premium has come into sterling. Rachel Reeves MP reminds Carney that the latest Inflation Report states that interest rates are likely to rise, not fall. How can he can so confident? Mark Carney gives a rather dovish answer, says the Bank expects interest rates to rise, gradually, over the forecast horizon. But of course, if risks increased and the global economy deteriorated, that would have implications. So do you expect the next move to be up, not down? Carney replies that the UK domestic economy is positive, but that must be balanced with disappointing signs from abroad. We must weigh the two up, and we\u2019re not taking a policy decision today. Mark Carney moves swiftly to crush speculation that the Bank of England could hit UK banks with negative interest rates. We have absolutely no intention, no interest, in doing that [imposing negative rates]. He adds that mortgage rates in Switzerland have actually gone up, even though the Swiss central bank have imposed negative borrowing costs. Can you explain the impact of negative interest rates on banks in simple terms, Steve Baker asks? MPC member Gertjan Vlieghe outlines how banks have assets, which are loans, and liabilities, which are deposits. They make a profit by charging borrowers more than they pay to savers. So far, no commercial bank has passed on negative interest rates to its depositors. So...as you lower interest rates more and more, the return on the assets goes down and down but there is no way to balance that with lower returns to savers. In conclusion: The lower interest rates go, the harder it is for banks to make a profit. Q: And do you need to abolish cash to allow negative interest rates to be imposed? Deciding whether people are allowed to hold cash is not one of our tools, Vlieghe replies. Steve Baker MP asks what the distributional impact of negative interest rates would be. It\u2019s too early to say, replies deputy governor Minouche Shafik. Central banks in several areas, including Switzerland, Denmark, Japan and the eurozone, now charge banks to leave money with them. However, this has not generally fed through to consumers - so we don\u2019t have the data to show the impact on the public. Gertjan Vlieghe adds that it\u2019s very hard to say how banks will react to negative interest rates - it depends on each institution. Mark Carney also insists that the Bank could launch fresh stimulus measures. It could cut interest rates closer to zero, from 0.5% today, or buy more assets though QE. Martin Weale says the Bank of England has more tools in the toolbox to stimulate the UK economy if needed. That could include fresh asset purchases though its QE programme [which the Bank has used to buy \u00a3375bn of UK government debt]. Jacob Rees-Mogg MP asks whether the recent fall in bank share prices reflects the macro-economic environment. Or something else? Mark Carney says it is primarily due to the macro picture. He cites \u2018mildly disappointing\u2019 data and uncertainty about the policy stance in emerging and advanced economies. That caused a \u201crenewed appreciation\u201d that we are in an environment of low nominal growth -- a difficult environment for banks. On top of that, Carney adds, there are some concerns in investing circles about the impact of negative interest rates on bank profitability. Dr Gertjan Vlieghe, a member of the Monetary Policy Committee, now warns MPs that the uncertainty over the In-Out EU referendum could hurt the UK economy. Asked about the impact of the weaker pound, he says that on its own, a weaker currency should boost inflation and growth. But the current situation is more complex, given the possibility of Brexit . Vlieghe tells the Treasury Committee that: We think the exchange rate is falling because of increased uncertainty about what\u2019s going to happen in the period leading up to, or the period following, the referendum. It is possible at some point that increased uncertainty from foreign exchange investors also ends up manifesting itself in increased uncertainty by households and businesses which may, or may not, delay or reduce their spending. So far we haven\u2019t seen very clear evidence of that, but we are watching very carefully. So it\u2019s not at all obvious that a weaker pound is a net boost to the economy, concludes Vlieghe, who worked for a hedge fund before being appointed to the MPC last summer. Back to the pound.... and Martin Weale says the recent fall in sterling should push inflation up (as it makes imports more expensive) Mark Carney says he agrees, adding that the recent fall in the pound is partly due to the EU referendum [reminder, it hit a seven year low on Monday]. Carney addes that the Bank \u201cwill take the exchange rate as given\u201d --[ie, it will not make predictions about the referendum result, and its impact on sterling]. And the Bank\u2019s agents across the UK will be watching for signs that business confidence has been hit by exchange rate moves. The committee is keen to find out whether the Bank of England will make a profit or a loss on its bond-buying quantitative easing programme. After all, the richest households have certainly benefitted, because QE drives up asset prices. And we know who holds them..... Tyrie then turns to Britain\u2019s banks - is Carney confident that they are robust enough to rise out another crisis? He points out that Sir John Vickers, who conducted a major inquiry into the UK financial sector after the 2008 crisis, has warned that the banks haven\u2019t gone far enough. What\u2019s your view, governor? Carney insists that the UK banks have met the new capital requirements. So why have bank shares fallen so sharply? Carney blames worries about profitability, not solvency: Since the start of the year bank stocks have been under pressure. There are a variety of causes of that but what is not a cause, what it does not indicate in my view is concerns about the resilience of the institutions. \u201cThe fundamental concerns are about the returns of the institutions.\u201d Andrew Tyrie does have one question on the EU referendum: Q: Has the Bank modelled the impact on sterling if the Out campaign win, given what\u2019s been going on in the markets in recent days? Mark Carney says the bank will treat the June 23rd referendum \u201cexactly like we treat any other political event\u201d. That means the Bank will monitor developments in markets and confidence, and feed those changes into its models. The Bank won\u2019t take any judgements about who will win, or assess the consequences of a leave vote. Q: So what would I see if I looked at your models? We don\u2019t make forecasts about the future value of the pound as part of the model, Carney says. But he then points to the recent volatility in the foreign exchange and options markets, as investors brace for the In-Out referendum in four month\u2019s time. There have been movements, obviously, in sterling, since the timing of the referendum became clear, says governor Carney, adding: Particularly, there has been a sharp increase in risk reversals - buying more downside protection against future falls in sterling around the referendum date as opposed to upside protection. They have spiked to levels consistent with around the height of the Scottish referendum. And they\u2019ve been particularly concentrated against cable...the sterling/dollar options market. That\u2019s as far as Carney will go today - we may need to wait until next month\u2019s hearing for more.... Andrew Tyrie, committee chairman, says he doesn\u2019t want to linger on the Brexit issue for long - as Carney is going to testify about it on 8 March. Panic averted - the session is starting now... The FT\u2019s Emily Cadman reports that Mark Carney is behind schedule.... Looks like there\u2019s a small delay with the web feed of Mark Carney\u2019s session at parliament (hurry up chaps!). Helpfully, Reuters are on the case -- with some comments from deputy governor Minouche Shafik: She\u2019s predicted that UK interest rates will rise, in due course, rather than being cut to fresh record lows. BANK OF ENGLAND DEPUTY GOVERNOR SHAFIK SAYS IF LABOUR MARKET CONTINUES TO TIGHTEN, EXPECT WAGE GROWTH WILL PICK UP BANK OF ENGLAND\u2019S SHAFIK SAYS DIFFICULT TO PREDICT TIMING OF WAGE PICK-UP BANK OF ENGLAND\u2019S SHAFIK SAYS BELIEVES NEXT INTEREST RATE MOVE WILL BE UP The governor of the Bank of England, Mark Carney, is about to take his seat in the Thatcher Room at the Houses of Parliament. He\u2019ll be quizzed by the Treasury committee about the Bank\u2019s latest inflation report, in which it slashed its UK growth forecasts and suggested interest rates may not rise this year. But we\u2019re also hoping to hear Carney\u2019s views on the UK\u2019s EU referendum. You can watch the hearing live, here (right-click to open in a new tab). Carney is accompanied by: Dr Minouche Shafik, Deputy Governor, Markets and Banking, Dr Gertjan Vlieghe, External Member of the Monetary Policy Committee Martin Weale, External Member of the Monetary Policy Committee Bloomberg economist Maxime Sbaihi is alarmed by the fall in German business confidence this month: The euro just hit a three-week low, losing 0.3% to $1.0993 against the US dollar. The single currency is being dragged down by this morning\u2019s weak German business confidence report and the knock-on effect of Britain\u2019s EU referendum (as discussed earlier) Morale among Germany\u2019s business leaders has hit a one-year low, after falling at its fastest rate in over four years this month. IFO, the Munich-based think tank, has reported that German corporate chiefs are much gloomier about future prospects, due to the slowdown in China and recent stock market volatility. IFO\u2019s business sentiment index has fallen for the third month running, to 105.7 from 107.3 in January. That\u2019s the lowest since December 2014. It was driven by a slump in business expectations, suggesting firms are worried about prospects this year. Carsten Brzeski of ING is calling it a \u201cwake-up call\u201d, adding: Global events have finally reached German companies\u2019 boardrooms..... Expectations have taken another sharp hit from recent market turmoil, the adverse impact of low oil prices and renewed concerns about a slowing of the Chinese economy, dropping to 98.8 in February, from 102.3 in January. There\u2019s a lot of chatter that the Britain\u2019s EU referendum could spark a sterling crisis. And that\u2019s because the pound (like the English cricket team) has a worrying history of occasionally collapsing under pressure. Hat-tip to Bank of New York Mellon, and Bloomberg, for this chart: The pound is hovering around $1.413 this morning, having hit a seven-year low of $1.4057 yesterday. FXTM research analyst Lukman Otunuga believes the pound could fall further in the run-up to June\u2019s vote, and take the euro with it. The growing speculation that a Brexit may spillover to the Eurozone and threaten the future of the European Union has already encouraged bearish investors to attack the Euro across the global currency markets. Shares in Standard Chartered are sliding sharply after it posted its first annual loss since 1989. The bank has lost $1.5bn, and warned that it faces a \u201cbroad range of challenges and uncertainties....notably China and commodities\u201d. The loss is partly due to a $1.8bn restructuring charge as Standard Chartered tries to address the slowdown in emerging markets (the bank is a big player in Asia). The City aren\u2019t impressed -- shares slumped by 11% as investors digested the details. They\u2019re currently down 6%. More to follow later... Over in Frankfurt, the German DAX has slid by 103 points, or over 1%. Investors aren\u2019t impressed by the first fall in German exports since 2012. Each of the 30 companies on the DAX is down, led by energy and utility firm RWE (-2%). Deutsche Bank has shed 1.5%. European stock markets are sliding in early trading. In London, the FTSE 100 has shed 48 points, or 0.8%. The blue-chip index is being dragged down by mining shares, after BHP Billiton reported that \u00a34bn loss and warned that commodity prices will remain weak. Conner Campbell of SpreadEx says BHP\u2019s decision to slash its shareholder payout has shocked investors: It doesn\u2019t help that the mining sector got its own unwelcome surprise; whilst it was expected that BHP Billiton would post its first half year loss in 16 years (coming in \u00a34 billion in the red) analysts were still looking for a 31p dividend. Instead BHP slashed its interim payout by 75% to 16p, whilst also sacrificing its progressive dividend policy in order to protect its credit rating. The company\u2019s subsequent 3.5% slide helped ensure its mining peers started the day at a loss, dragging the FTSE down by nearly 50 points after the bell. Ralph Solveen, an economist at Commerzbank AG in Frankfurt, is concerned that German exports fell by 0.6% in the last quarter of 2015. He told Bloomberg that: \u201cInvestment was rather solid. On the other hand, given the rather weak development of exports, you can see that there\u2019s a problem for the German economy.\u201d Germany has suffered a fall in exports as the powerhouse European economy is hit by the global downturn. The Federal Statistical Office has revealed that exports shrank by 0.6% in the final three months of 2015. Economists had expected a dip of 0.3%. That, according to the Financial Times, is the first decline in three years. Imports rose by 0.5% during the quarter, suggesting that Germany was propped up by its domestic economy. ING\u2019s Carsten Brzeski fears that German consumers might struggle to sustain this performance in 2016: Today\u2019s figures also confirmed that Germany grew by an unspectacular 0.3% in the final three months of 2015, with growth dragged back by its negative trade performance. Government spending grew by 1% during the quarter - perhaps partly due to the cost of helping the refugees who arrived in Germany last year. Asian stock markets have fallen today, as the recent rally in shares subsided. And it could be a downbeat day in Europe too, with the main indices expected to fall. Shares are being pulled down by the oil price, which has dipped by almost 2% this morning - erasing its own recent gains. And mining giant BGP Billiton has added to the pessimism, by reporting a stonking loss of \u00a34bn for the last six months - and slashing its dividend by three-quarters. Reuters has the details from Asia: MSCI\u2019s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan fell 0.2%, after earlier rising 0.4% to its highest level since January 8. Japan\u2019s Nikkei erased morning gains to close down 0.4%. Korea\u2019s Kospi, which started the day higher, and Australia\u2019s ASX 200, which opened little changed from Monday\u2019s three-week high close, both ended the day with losses. Chinese stocks , which opened little changed, were last trading down almost 1%. Oil markets jumped as much as 7% on Monday as speculation about falling U.S. shale output fed the notion that crude prices may be bottoming after their 20-month collapse. But they retreated on Tuesday on concern that any cuts to U.S. production may be countered by rising output from Iran. U.S. crude futures fell 1.9%, and the international benchmark Brent slid 1.6% on Tuesday. City firm IG reckons European markets will fall at the open. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Coming up today..... Britain\u2019s In-Out EU referendum continues to cast a shadow over the markets, after Brexit fears sent the pound sliding to a seven year low yesterday. The prospect of months of heated debate and uncertainty over the UK\u2019s future is already weighing on the pound in early trading, as some investors continue to sell sterling. Overnight, a group of UK business chiefs have signed a letter backing the In campaign. But crucially, others have declined to get involved. The bosses of Tesco, Sainsbury\u2019s and Morrison all remain firmly on the fence.... Bank of England governor Mark Carney should be quizzed about the European vote, when he testifies to MPs at 10am GMT on the Bank\u2019s latest inflation report. Deputy governor Minouche Shafik, and fellow interest rate-setters Martin Weale and Gertjan Vlieghe should be providing support. On the economics front, new German trade data is being released this morning. We also get the latest IFO measure of business confidence in the eurozone\u2019s largest economy, at 9am GMT. Standard Chartered, the bank with a big exposure to emerging markets, is reporting results at 8.15am. And in the afternoon, the latest US consumer confidence figure are released. They\u2019ll show how much damage has been caused by the stock market turmoil earlier this year. We\u2019ll be tracking all the main events through the day...",

      "bodyText": "Standard Chartered has plunged to its first full-year loss since 1989, sparking another turbulent day for its shares on the stock market and the revelation that it is considering clawing back bonuses from 150 senior staff. The emerging markets focused bank revealed it is still being investigated for potential failings in its defences against financial crime as it reported a $1.5bn (\u00a31bn) loss for 2015. A review has been set up into whether bonuses can can be reclaimed after what Bill Winters, the new chief executive, described as a tumultuous year. Major restructuring costs of $1.8bn (\u00a31.28bn) and a $863m repricing of complex financial instruments drove the bank to the loss which alongside a 87% rise in bad debts signalled a dramatic reversal in its fortunes. A year ago it had reported a $4.2bn profit but since then Winters has been parachuted in to replace Peter Sands as chief executive. Until three years ago, the bank had enjoyed 10 consecutive years of rising profits, even through the damaging 2008 financial crisis, but its focus on increasing revenues had led to a rise in problem loans. It specialises in emerging markets such as China, Indonesia and Korea. \u201cIt rips at our souls every single time we look the results,\u201d said Winters, who was paid $12.8m, including a $10m buy-out award. Sands was handed $4.6m after leaving in June and two other directors who have also left received more than $4m between them. Sands, who ran the bank during the 2008 crisis, is entitled to a $722,131 a year pension and during the year bonuses from previous years cashed in. The market reacted sharply to the results with the shares diving 11% at one stage. The loss was later reduced to 5%, and the bank remained one of the biggest fallers in the FTSE 100. As Winters announced that annual bonuses had been scraped for 2015, he said a new bonus scheme would be put to a shareholder vote at the annual general meeting in May. It will pay out nearly $9m to Winters if he achieves all the targets he set out in a three-year strategic review in November. Another 100 or so senior staff are also part of the new scheme. A handful of managers are being handed pay rises after the bank ditched the allowances that had been awarded alongside salaries to side step the EU cap which limits bonuses to twice times salary. The bank paid out $28m in such allowances last year and only Winters and the finance director Andy Halford will continue to receive them. Mike Rees, a long-standing colleague who is leaving in April after being paid around \u00a350m since the 2008 crisis, was entitled to start receiving his pension 0f $833,935 a year earlier this month when he turned 60, the annual report showed. Winters said: \u201cOur performance was poor and, in many ways, unacceptable. Given current market conditions and the early stage of implementation of our strategy, we expect the financial performance of the group to remain subdued during 2016.\u201d At the half-year stage Winters halved the dividend and the final dividend has now been axed after a \u00a33.3bn cash call and a restructuring involving 15,000 job cuts was announced in November. Axing senior managers cost $45m. In November, the bank revealed it faced investigations by regulators in the US and UK. Winters said the bank was continuing to cooperate with the relevant authorities but \u201cwe remain unable to determine when these investigations will conclude or the size of any potential fines that might result. We will provide further updates in due course.\u201d The Financial Conduct Authority is investigating Standard Chartered\u2019s financial crime controls, looking at their effectiveness and governance within the correspondent banking business carried out by its London branch. Winters\u2019 appointment signalled a major clearout of the former management of the bank, including the chairman, Sir John Peace, who said the search for his replacement was still going on. Its shares have been languishing at 25-year lows, and other bank shares have been under pressure amid fears of a re-run of the 2008 crisis. But Winters said \u201cthis is not a banking crisis\u201d, pointing to strong capital ratios and liquidity. Sandy Chen, an analyst at Cenkos, said \u201cdespite the blood and gore\u201d Standard Chartered had capital ratios well above the regulatory minimum.",

The chief executive, Jim Mullen, emphasised the bookmaker\u2019s underlying results, which he said showed growth in revenues across all divisions amid a renewed focus on small bets. Ladbrokes sank to a \u00a343.2m loss before tax in 2015, compared with a \u00a338m profit the previous year, after taking into account a range of one-off factors. The bookmaker lamented the \u00a350m impact of increased taxes on machine gaming and a new point of consumption tax on gambling operators based overseas. It spent more on marketing to promote its digital business, but Mullen said this was already paying off, with revenue in the division up more than 31% in the fourth quarter. Ladbrokes also booked \u00a399m of impairments, of which \u00a358m was due to revaluation of its UK and Ireland portfolio and \u00a318m was attributed to costs associated with the Gala Coral merger. Mullen brushed off fears that Andy Hornby, widely expected to be chief operating officer of the combined group, might be barred from being a company director amid an inquiry by regulators into the collapse of HBOS, the bank he ran. \u201cOur view on Andy hasn\u2019t changed,\u201d said Mullen. \u201cHe\u2019s an accomplished executive.

We want the man in the street who might put on a \u00a35 half-time full-time score.\u201d Ladbrokes has addressed concerns about responsible gambling amid an increase of online betting firms.

      "bodyText": "The Bank of England could cut interest rates to zero, but will seek to avoid following Sweden, Denmark and the eurozone by setting negative rates to bolster growth and inflation. Mark Carney, the Bank\u2019s governor, said Threadneedle Street had \u201cno intention and no interest\u201d in implementing negative interest rates and would adopt the full range of the Bank\u2019s other powers to deal with a downturn in the economy. He said: \u201cIf we were in a position where the economy needed additional stimulus ... we could cut interest rates towards zero. We could engage in additional asset purchases, including a variety of assets. \u201cWe could also provide a perspective where we could adjust our policy horizon \u2013 in other words we could shorten our policy horizon over which we wanted to return inflation to target.\u201d Carney, who was responding to questions from MPs on the Treasury select committee, said the world economy had entered a period of low growth and low interest rates and was likely to be prone to financial shocks. He added that Threadneedle Street might need to respond with additional stimulus measures, but to protect the profitability of the UK\u2019s banks and building societies, the monetary policy committee (MPC) would avoid cutting from the current base rate of 0.5% to below zero. The message that negative interest rates would be a last resort comes before an expected push by the European Central Bank to deploy the measure on a bigger scale at its next meeting to increase lending and growth in the eurozone. Japan and Switzerland have also adopted negative interest rates in recent months. Carney said negative rates in the UK would damage building societies, which would find it difficult to make a profit on mortgage lending if they were forced to pay an interest rate on funds deposited at the Bank of England. The aim of negative interest rates, which effectively puts a charge on savers depositing funds, is to discourage commercial banks from leaving cash on deposit with Threadneedle Street and lend it to businesses and consumers instead. Some central banks have also pushed rates below zero to discourage foreign investors from depositing funds and putting pressure on the exchange rate. Sweden and Denmark did so to drive down the value of their currencies to maintain parity with the euro. Japan cut its rates to to depress the value of the yen. Carney said building societies would find it difficult to make money in a negative interest rate environment. \u201cWe take very seriously the potentially counter-productive impact on the building society sector and the financial sector more broadly.\u201d He said in Switzerland, mortgage rates have gone up despite the country\u2019s central bank setting negative interest rates. \u201cSo it is not clear that the domestic transmission mechanism has been effective,\u201d he noted. Deputy governor Minouche Shafik said she was sceptical that negative interest rates were passed on by banks to the benefit of customers. \u201cWhat we observe from that experience is that the effect is passed on to lower money market rates, but what we don\u2019t see is that it gets passed on to deposit rates,\u201d she said.",

      "bodyText": "The London Stock Exchange is in talks to merge with Germany\u2019s Deutsche B\u00f6rse in a \u00a321bn deal that would seal an alliance first discussed at the turn of the millennium. The LSE said on Tuesday it was in detailed discussions with its German rival about an all-share merger. Under the proposed structure, the balance of ownership favours Frankfurt, with Deutsche B\u00f6rse shareholders owning 54.4% of the combined company and LSE shareholders holding 45.6%. However, the merged company\u2019s board will have equal numbers of members from each business. The UK exchange said: \u201cThe boards believe that the potential merger would represent a compelling opportunity for both companies to strengthen each other in an industry-defining combination, creating a leading European-based global markets infrastructure group.\u201d The exchanges have considered combining forces before. They agreed to merge in 2000 before a rival bid for the LSE from Sweden\u2019s OM Gruppen scuppered the deal, which was then rejected anyway. The LSE then rejected a formal \u00a31.3bn offer from Deutsche B\u00f6rse in January 2005. The LSE confirmed the latest talks after its shares surged in response to a Reuters report about a possible merger. LSE shares jumped 17% to \u00a327.06, valuing it at about \u00a39.5bn. Deutsche B\u00f6rse shares rose 7% to \u20ac81.71, giving it a value of almost \u00a312bn. Xavier Rolet, the LSE\u2019s chief executive, and Carsten Kengeter, the boss of Deutsche B\u00f6rse, are both keen dealmakers and Rolet said last year he expected to merge with a big rival. Rolet has expanded the LSE by buying a number of businesses, including LCH.Clearnet, which gave the UK company a clearing house for trades in derivatives \u2013 contracts that allow traders to bet on movements in asset values. The LSE said a merger would generate extra revenues and cost savings, while creating a powerhouse in the world of derivative trading. Deutsche B\u00f6rse owns Eurex, Europe\u2019s largest derivatives exchange, and the LSE operates SwapClear, a clearing service for over-the-counter derivatives. The two businesses do not work together and the companies are understood to believe combining them would bring in more business from customers who would benefit from lower costs and reduced capital requirements for their trades. David Cheetham, a market analyst at the foreign exchange broker XTB.com, said: \u201cIf the deal were to go ahead it would create a clear market leader for Europe and one of the largest exchanges in the world for trading and risk managing derivatives.\u201d If a deal is agreed, all major business divisions would operate under their existing brand names and the merged company\u2019s board would have equal numbers of members from each side. The LSE declined to comment on who would lead the company or any aspects not covered in its official announcement.",

Under the proposed structure, the balance of ownership favours Frankfurt, with Deutsche B\u00f6rse shareholders owning 54.4% of the combined company and LSE shareholders holding 45.6%. However, the merged company\u2019s board will have equal numbers of members from each business.</p> <p>The UK exchange said: \u201cThe boards believe that the potential merger would represent a compelling opportunity for both companies to strengthen each other in an industry-defining combination, creating a leading European-based global markets infrastructure group.\u201d</p> <p>The exchanges have considered combining forces before. They agreed to merge in 2000 <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2000/aug/29/1\">before a rival bid for the LSE from Sweden\u2019s OM Gruppen</a> scuppered the deal, which was then rejected anyway. The LSE then <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2005/jan/27/germany.money\">rejected a formal \u00a31.3bn offer from Deutsche B\u00f6rse</a> in January 2005.</p> <p>The LSE confirmed the latest talks after its shares surged in response to a <a href=\"http://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-lse-m-a-deutsche-boerse-idUKKCN0VW1E2\">Reuters report</a> about a possible merger. LSE shares jumped 17% to \u00a327.06, valuing it at about \u00a39.5bn. Deutsche B\u00f6rse shares rose 7% to \u20ac81.71, giving it a value of almost \u00a312bn.</p> <p>Xavier Rolet, the LSE\u2019s chief executive, and Carsten Kengeter, the boss of Deutsche B\u00f6rse, are both keen dealmakers and Rolet said last year he <a href=\"http://www.wsj.com/articles/lse-chief-says-exchange-could-do-deal-with-rival-within-two-years-1429701017\">expected to merge with a big rival</a>. Rolet has expanded the LSE by buying a number of businesses, including LCH.Clearnet, which gave the UK company a clearing house for trades in derivatives \u2013 contracts that allow traders to bet on movements in asset values.</p> <p>The LSE said a merger would generate extra revenues and cost savings, while creating a powerhouse in the world of derivative trading. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2005/jan/27/germany.money\">Deutsche B\u00f6rse</a> owns Eurex, Europe\u2019s largest derivatives exchange, and the LSE operates SwapClear, a clearing service for over-the-counter derivatives. <br></p> <p>The two businesses do not work together and the companies are understood to believe combining them would bring in more business from customers who would benefit from lower costs and reduced capital requirements for their trades.</p> <p>David Cheetham, a market analyst at the foreign exchange broker XTB.com, said: \u201cIf the deal were to go ahead it would create a clear market leader for Europe and one of the largest exchanges in the world for trading and risk managing derivatives.\u201d</p> <p>If a deal is agreed, all major business divisions would operate under their existing brand names and the merged company\u2019s board would have equal numbers of members from each side. The LSE declined to comment on who would lead the company or any aspects not covered in its official announcement.</p>",

Speaking at the Treasury select committee, Mark Carney said the central bank was not seeking to predict the outcome of the referendum, which takes place on 23 June, or the impact of a vote to leave. But he said it was watching for the potential impact of fluctuations in the value of sterling on economic activity. \u201cThere have been movements in sterling since it\u2019s been increasingly clear, and now clear, [about] the timing of the referendum. Particularly, there has been a sharp increase in risk reversals - buying more downside protection against future falls in sterling around the referendum date as opposed to upside protection,\u201d Carney said. \u201cThey have spiked to levels consistent with around the height of the Scottish referendum,\u201d the Bank governor added, noting that they have been \u201cparticularly concentrated\u201d in the sterling/dollar options market. Carney said if uncertainty over the referendum started to affect confidence in the economy, the BoE\u2019s rate setters would expect that to show up in surveys conducted by its agents across the country. He said the BoE was making contingency plans and that its Prudential Regulation Authority division was keeping a check on banks\u2019 planning for the vote. Gertjan Vlieghe, who sits alongside Carney on the bank\u2019s monetary policy committee, told MPs sterling\u2019s fall could affect confidence among consumers and companies. Normally a fall in the pound would be good for the economy but that may not be the case because of the referendum, he said. \u201cIt is possible that increased uncertainty from foreign exchange investors ends up manifesting itself in increased uncertainty by households and businesses which may or may not delay or curtail their spending. We haven\u2019t seen very clear evidence of that but that is what we are watching very carefully.\u201d The pound tumbled to a seven-year low on Monday as traders reacted to the announcement of the referendum and the emergence of the London mayor Boris Johnson as a supporter of the out campaign. Currency experts forecast further falls in the value of sterling before the vote. The pound had declined strongly against the dollar and the euro before David Cameron announced the referendum on Saturday in the expectation that the vote would be announced soon. Carney said in October that EU membership had been one of the main reasons for Britain\u2019s good economic performance in the four decades since it joined the bloc. But he also said membership had opened the UK up to shocks since the financial crisis. The Bank governor and other MPC members appeared before MPs to discuss its inflation report. He will return to the committee on 8 March for a session about the EU referendum.",

The airport said Europe brought Britain more trade and prosperity. The chief executive, John Holland-Kaye, added: \u201cHeathrow believes that the UK will be better off remaining in a reformed EU. We are the UK\u2019s only hub airport, connecting Britain to over 80 long-haul destinations, and handling over a quarter of UK exports \u2013 but we recognise that for business to thrive we also need to be part of the single European market.\u201d He said being part of the EU had made air travel affordable and convenient, which fuelled jobs, exports and growth. Holland-Kaye said: \u201cA vote to remain offers the best of both worlds: it secures our place as a powerhouse in the global economy while remaining in the world\u2019s largest free-trade zone.\u201d Despite Heathrow\u2019s support for the campaign to remain, it believes its own prospects could be enhanced in some areas by Brexit. The chief financial officer, Michael Uzielli, said: \u201cHeathrow would continue to thrive, but the decision to expand would be even more urgent if we did leave. \u201cTrade with the EU would be harder than today and there would be more pressure to connect to world markets \u2013 and Heathrow is the only airport that connects Britain with those markets. But the imperative to expand is urgent whether we are in or not.\u201d Holland-Kaye said he was confident of a positive decision on the proposed third runway in July, once the EU referendum had passed, and that the airport could meet the government\u2019s environmental obligations. One area of negotiation is likely to be how much Heathrow would contribute to surface access work around the hub, including widening the M25, which would cost about \u00a35.7bn according to the Airports Commission, and at least \u00a315bn according to Transport for London. Uzielli said while Heathrow could potentially afford a higher expansion bill, it believed its contribution should be about \u00a31bn. \u201cWe\u2019re a very robust company and have a robust financing platform. We raise a couple of billion of pounds a year and are A-rated. It\u2019s more a question of fairness. Where it\u2019s directly related to expansion we think that is part of the costs, but we don\u2019t think that airline passengers should have to pay for other infrastructure.\u201d The comments came as Heathrow reported a 22% rise in full-year profits to \u00a3223m for 2015, as 75 million passengers used the airport in its 70th year of operation.",

That finding prompted John McDonnell, Labour\u2019s shadow chancellor, to warn that Britain \u201cfaces the prospect of a decade over which people will be poorer than at the start,\u201d adding: \u201cThese figures further show why it is the completely wrong time for George Osborne to be taking money out of people\u2019s pockets.\u201d According to the ONS, in 2014-15 the typical household paid \u00a37,700 in direct taxes, which includes income tax and council tax. After these are taken into account, the average income enjoyed by the richest 20% of households is around five and a half times that of the poorest 20% - \u00a367,000 and \u00a312,300 a year respectively. However, the department said the economic downturn \u201chad a negative impact on the incomes of all but the poorest fifth of the population\u201d. It said the least well-off 20% of households were the only group whose average disposable income did not fall between 2007-08 and 2012-13. In 2014-15 the typical income of this group was \u00a3700 (5.8%) above its 2007-08 level. By contrast, the average disposable income of the richest fifth of households fell the most following the downturn: by 3.2% between 2007-08 and 2014-15. It remains \u00a32,000 below its previous peak. This has largely been blamed on a fall in average income from employment, though the department pointed out there had also been a sizeable fall in the amount of child benefit received by the richest 20% after the government introduced a tax charge affecting parents earning more than \u00a350,000 a year. The ONS said the increase for the poorest fifth was mainly due to an increase in average levels of pay for this group, along with higher benefit payments such as tax credits and jobseeker\u2019s allowance. While the report very much focuses on disposable income rather than wealth and assets such as property, the figures are likely to spark controversy among inequality campaigners, and could be seen to oppose other data that shows wealth in the UK concentrating in fewer and fewer hands. A report from Credit Suisse found the top 10% of the British population have seen their share of total wealth in the UK rise from 52% to 54% since the financial crash. A separate report from the Institute of Fiscal Studies last year laid bare the extent of inequality in Britain, finding that 9% of households have no assets, while 5% are worth in excess of \u00a31.2m. But the ONS said more recently incomes had generally begun to recover. Between 2012-13 and 2014-15, average incomes increased for all groups, with the middle fifth of the population seeing the biggest increase: \u00a31,500 in real terms (or 6.4%), reversing the fall following the economic crisis. The average incomes of retired households were \u201clargely unaffected\u201d by the downturn \u2013 in fact, the typical figure grew by \u00a31,500 (or 7.7%) between 2007-08 and 2014-15 to reach \u00a321,000. This was helped by a number of factors, including the fact that annual increases in the basic state pension are protected by a \u201ctriple lock\u201d. However, the average figure for non-retired households fell over this period, and was \u00a32,600 lower in 2012-13 than in 2007-08. Since then, the typical figure has risen to \u00a328,300 \u2013 but this is still around \u00a3900 below the 2007-08 level of \u00a329,200. The ONS figures are based mainly on data taken from the annual Living Costs and Food survey, which looks at the income and outgoings of about 5,000 households, including children. The results are weighted so they represent the total UK population based on 2011 census data.",

Analysts at Canaccord Genuity said: The beat to our number was mainly due to a better margin performance than expected.

The group has increased its capital return by 280p over the original plan of 620p set out in 2011. 110p is going to be paid in April 2016 with the remaining 550p to be paid to shareholders in equal instalments of 110p each year over the next five years. While the market was probably expecting some good news on the capital plan being accelerated, the increase in the capital return and smoothing of the remaining 550p is likely to be better than consensus expected.

Commodity shares are also under pressure on renewed concerns about a slowdown in China, along with talk that the country\u2019s central bank may be reluctant to provide further stimulus measures.

      "bodyText": "Key oil industry figures have called on the chancellor to use next month\u2019s budget to prop up the North Sea oil industry after a collapse in investment. The trade body Oil &amp; Gas UK called for permanent tax breaks, warning that low Brent crude prices were choking off the investment needed to extract the oil left under the North Sea. It expects cash-strapped members to spend just \u00a31bn on new projects this year, compared with an annual average of \u00a38bn over the past five years. It came as the International Energy Agency warned that investment cuts worldwide meant that when prices start to rise \u2013 as it expects in 2017 \u2013 they are likely to jump sharply. Fatih Birol, executive director of the IEA, said: \u201cIt is easy for consumers to be lulled into complacency by ample stocks and low prices today, but they should heed the writing on the wall: the historic investment cuts we are seeing raise the odds of unpleasant oil-security surprises in the not too distant future.\u201d The agency forecast that global oil supply would grow by 4.1m barrels a day between 2015 and 2021; in the previous six years it grew by 11m barrels a day. Oil &amp; Gas UK said the North Sea firms had tried ensure the industry stayed afloat by slashing costs. It said oil explorers on the UK continental shelf cut the cost of production by 40% from an average $29.30 a barrel in 2014 to $20.95 last year. But the oil price has tumbled by about 70% \u2013 or more than $100 a barrel \u2013 since the summer of 2014, wiping out the effect of the cost-cutting drive. Oil &amp; Gas UK said that while firms could make further cuts, they would struggle to afford investment with oil hovering at about $30 a barrel. It called for urgent changes to the taxes paid by North Sea companies, warning of heightened fears over the long-term future of the industry. Oil companies were handed tax relief last year when George Osborne reduced their rate to 50%, or up to 67.5% on some fields where petroleum revenue tax also applies. But Oil &amp; Gas UK said the chancellor must go further or risk seeing the North Sea\u2019s decline accelerate, adding to job losses in the industry. \u201cA significant, permanent reduction in those rates is now urgently needed,\u201d said Oil &amp; Gas UK\u2019s chief executive, Deirdre Michie. The trade body pointed to the potential impact of a shrinking oil industry on the wider economy. It said total capital expenditure fell from \u00a314.8bn to \u00a311.6bn last year and predicted it would drop further, to \u00a39bn this year. A study by Rystad Energy found that the supply chain serving the North Sea shrank by about 25% last year and was expected to contract further this year. The increasing difficulty of making money in the North Sea is also speeding up decommissioning, where companies shut down oilfields that are no longer economically viable. This has seen reserves held by companies for future development fall from 10bn to 8.8bn barrels of oil, compared with Oil &amp; Gas UK\u2019s estimate of 20bn barrels remaining overall. The trade body believes that decommissioning will cost up to \u00a355bn by 2050, while Revenue &amp; Customs estimates that the taxpayer will pick up \u00a316bn of the bill through tax relief on decommissioning. Oil &amp; Gas UK warned that \u201cthe pace of decommissioning is accelerating\u201d, indicating that the cost of dismantling old oil platforms and cleaning up after them could rise still further. The accelerating decline of the North Sea is forecast to punch a hole in the UK\u2019s tax take, even as Osborne battles to erase the deficit. The Office for Budget Responsibility predicts receipts of \u00a3130m from the North Sea in 2015-16, compared with \u00a311bn four years previously. \u201cThe basin has to compete fiercely in the global market to attract price-constrained capital to the UK,\u201d said Michie. \u201cTogether we need to transform the basin into a highly competitive, low-tax, high-activity province, which is attractive to a variety of operators and sustains and supports the important supply chain based here.\u201d David Cameron announced a \u00a320m package to support the oil industry last month, on top of \u00a3500m for the north-east of Scotland, which is particularly reliant on the sector. But Scotland\u2019s deputy first minister, John Swinney, has urged Osborne to cut industry taxes once again and provide extra assistance such as loan guarantees. Iain Conn, chief executive of Centrica, owner of British Gas, has also called on Osborne to intervene, citing an estimated 65,000 job losses in oil and connected industries in 2015. \u201cThe North Sea is really hurting,\u201d he wrote in a letter to the chancellor. \u201cThe government needs to be agile here. It needs to encourage companies to keep their fields going and keep their people. The government has to be really thoughtful about taxation in the North Sea. \u201cThey can always put it up again \u2013 indeed, they have quite a good record of doing that. But right now there is a case to be made that corporation tax in the North Sea should just be corporation tax and that petroleum revenue tax should probably disappear for a while.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Vienna is the world\u2019s best city to live in; Baghdad is the worst, and London, Paris and New York do not even make it into the top 35, according to international research into quality of life. German-speaking cities dominate the rankings in the 18th Mercer Quality of Life study, with Vienna joined by Zurich, Munich, D\u00fcsseldorf and Frankfurt in the top seven. Paris has tumbled down the league, falling 10 places to 37th, just ahead of London at 39th, almost entirely because of the city\u2019s vulnerability to terrorist attacks. The study examined social and economic conditions, health, education, housing and the environment, and is used by big companies to assess where they should locate and how much they should pay staff. Viennese-born Helena Hartlauer, 32, said she was not surprised at her city\u2019s top position. The municipality\u2019s social democratic government has a long tradition of investing in high-quality social housing, making Vienna almost uniquely affordable among major cities. \u201cI live in a 100sq metre turn-of-the-century apartment in a good area about 20 minutes\u2019 walk into the city centre. But my rent is just \u20ac800 (\u00a3625) a month.\u201d An equivalent apartment in London would cost upwards of \u00a32,000, and even more in New York, ranked 44th in the table. US cities perform relatively poorly in the study, largely because of issues around personal safety and crime. The highest ranking city in the US is San Francisco, at 28th; Boston is 34th. Canadian cities, led by Vancouver, far outrank their US rivals in the table. \u201cYou don\u2019t realise how safe Vienna is until you head abroad,\u201d said Hartlauer. \u201cWe also have terrific public transport, with the underground working 24 hours at weekends, and it only costs \u20ac1 per trip [for those who buy a \u20ac365 annual card] .\u201d Vienna benefited enormously from the fall of the Berlin Wall, becoming the gateway to eastern European countries that often have historic ties to the former Austro-Hungarian empire. \u201cOur big USP is our geographic location,\u201d said Martin Eichtinger, Austrian ambassdaor to London, who lived in Vienna for 20 years. \u201cThe fall of the Berlin Wall helped define Vienna as the hub for companies wanting to do business in central Europe.\u201d According to the World Bank, Austria has one of the highest figures for GDP per head in the world, just behind the US and ahead of Germany and Britain, although quite some way below neighbouring Switzerland. Zurich in Switzerland is named by Mercer as having the world\u2019s second highest quality of life, but the Viennese say their city is far more fun. \u201cThere are more students in Vienna than any other German-speaking city,\u201d said Hartlauer. \u201cIt\u2019s a very fast growing, young and lively city,\u201d she added \u2013 though she conceded she works for the city\u2019s tourist board. Vienna has long been overlooked by British weekend city break tourists, who instead flock to Barcelona or Berlin and tend to think of Austria as somewhere for skiing, lakes and mountains. But after an increase in budget flights from regional British cities such as Manchester and Edinburgh, Vienna is fast catching up as a popular destination. In 2015 there were 588,000 British visitors to Vienna, up 18% on the year before. The flow is both ways; Eichtinger said London has become the No 1 city destination for Austrian visitors. \u201cVienna has ranked top in the last seven published rankings,\u201d said Mercer. \u201cIt scores highly in a number of categories; it provides a safe and stable environment to live in, a high level of public utilities and transport facilities, and good recreational facilities.\u201d The European migrant crisis, which has seen large numbers of refugees and asylum seekers pass through Vienna en route to Germany, has had little impact on the city of nearly 1.8 million people, said Eichtinger. \u201cWe have managed to accommodate 90,000 refugees in Austria, but the numbers have slowed in recent months.\u201d London has never been in the quality-of-life top 10, says Mercer, damaged by its poor scores for air pollution, traffic congestion and climate. After London, Edinburgh is the next-ranking British city, in 46th place. Paris has suffered the biggest fall in this year\u2019s rankings. \u201cParis has remained stable for several years but has this year dropped 10 places overall in the overall ranking,\u201d said Mercer. \u201cThe drop was essentially due to the terrorist attacks in 2015, however, it is important to highlight that safety issues are a very highly weighted factor within the \u2018basket\u2019 so any small adjustments can have a big impact on the ranking.\u201d Auckland in New Zealand was the highest ranking English-speaking city in the survey, in third place, followed by Vancouver in fifth. Australian cities also perform very highly in the survey, with Sydney 10th and Melbourne 15th. The Economist has consistently ranked Melbourne as the world\u2019s most liveable city, although its survey has been criticised as too Anglocentric. War and political unrest are behind all the worst-ranked cities in the world. Surprisingly, Damascus is named as only the seventh worst, ranked better than not just Baghdad but also Bangui in Central African Republic, Sana\u2019a in Yemen, Port-au-Prince in Haiti, Khartoum in Sudan, and N\u2019Djamena in Chad. \u2022 This article was amended on 23 February 2016. An earlier version said Toronto was Canada\u2019s highest ranking city; that was Vancouver.",
