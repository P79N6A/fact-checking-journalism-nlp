      "bodyText": "The Dow Jones Industrial Average has gone above the 25,000 mark for the first time, on another day of surging share prices on stock markets across the US, Europe and Asia. In the UK the FTSE 100 closed at a record high on Thursday, tracking gains for equity markets around the world on a day when Japanese shares hit the highest level in 26 years. The Dow rose by more than 25% last year, while the S&amp;P 500 index made gains in every month of 2017 \u2013 something which has not happened for more than 90 years. Positive readings on the health of the US economy helped to power the fresh surge on Wall Street, after the ADP National Employment report estimated that firms had added 250,000 jobs in December \u2013 much higher than the 190,000 job additions that had been forecast by economists. World markets rose sharply after surveys for manufacturing and services activity this week pointed towards improving economic conditions in several countries. There were positive readings from the UK\u2019s dominant services sector on Thursday, suggesting the economy had its strongest quarter in the final three months of 2017. Meanwhile, European manufacturers this week reported the strongest month since before the creation of the euro. The Dow had added about 150 points by early afternoon in New York after hitting a peak of 25,100 during the morning. American Express, chemical firm DowDuPont and computer company IBM were among the biggest risers. US markets have been buoyed by Donald Trump\u2019s corporate tax cuts that will help major companies to boost their profits. The US Congress pushed through the corporate tax rate cut from 35% to 21% last month, which have been labelled by opponents as a gift to rich people. The president welcomed the fresh surge on the stock market, tweeting: \u201cDow just crashes through 25,000. Congrats! Big cuts in unnecessary regulations continuing.\u201d Although temperatures in New York were below freezing on Thursday, the buoyant mood among investors on Wall Street show little sign of deflating, with forecasters expecting further gains in 2018. But there are fears over the market overheating, as investors become complacent to emerging global risks. According to fund manager Alberto Gallo of Algebris Investments, investors could be guilty of \u201cirrational complacency\u201d ahead of a rocky period in 2018, after such a strong rise for equities over the course of last year. The chief risk for this year could also be a \u201cmelt-up,\u201d according to economists at TS Lombard, who warn shares may rise out of kilter with reality before a sharp meltdown. Risks could arise should tensions flare up in the Middle East or between the US and North Korea. There is also the prospect of market turbulence as central banks around the world begin to remove their unprecedented levels of support for the global economy, as they wind down quantitative easing packages and raise interest rates. Cheap money from the Federal Reserve in the US, the Bank of England and the European Central Bank have helped to inflate asset prices, as they pump money into buying bonds from financial institutions. That has depressed prices for debt and encouraged investors to pile into riskier assets, such as equities, to generate higher returns. The weak pound has also helped to support the FTSE 100, which gained 24 points on Thursday, as many companies in the blue-chip index of UK companies generate much of their earnings in foreign currencies. The index closed at 7,695.88, higher than its previous record close set on the final day of trading last year. Andrew Milligan, head of global strategy at Aberdeen Standard Investments, said very few parts of the world were not taking part in the current upswing in growth, which would help to power markets further ahead. He warned geopolitical risks as well as central banks withdrawing support too quickly could knock markets. \u201cMarkets can continue to make progress in 2018. Maybe not quite as good as for 2017, but they will still make some quite decent progress \u2013 as long as company cash flow comes through,\u201d he added.",

      "bodyText": "Welcome to the world of \u201cmelt-up\u201d, a phrase we could be hearing a lot in coming months. It describes the idea that the US stock market, despite currently looking absurdly expensive by traditional yardsticks, could be set for one last euphoric hurrah before the inevitable crash happens. There are a couple of reasons why the \u201cmelt-up\u201d theory may not be as wacky as it sounds. First, it comes from Jeremy Grantham, an investor who has rightly earned a reputation for knowing how to read financial bubbles. He dodged the end-of-the-century dotcom bubble and the 2007-09 blowup in the US housing market \u2013 two of the best calls anybody could have made in the past 20 years. Grantham\u2019s default setting, as you would expect, tends to be bearish, or at least cautious. If he\u2019s talking melt-up, that\u2019s newsworthy. Besides, GMO, the Boston-based fund management group he founded, manages $75bn of assets \u2013 he\u2019s a player. A second reason is that Grantham is certainly not arguing that shares are cheap. \u201cWe can be as certain as we ever get in stock market analysis that the current price is exceptionally high,\u201d he states. Instead, his melt-up thinking is driven by a \u201cmish-mash of statistical and psychological factors based on previous eras\u201d. On the statistical side, he points out that the global economy is in sync, profit margins are fat and president Trump\u2019s corporate tax cuts could make them even fatter and \u201cperhaps provide the oomph to keep stock prices rising\u201d. Then there\u2019s the fact that the current strength in the stock market is fairly broad-based. In past bubbles, the end was nigh when gains were concentrated in an increasingly small collection of \u201cwinners\u201d. The likes of Apple are roaring this time, but the same divergence has not occurred \u2013 yet. For \u201ctouchy-feely\u201d evidence of excess about to appear, Grantham looks at media coverage. US newspapers and TV stations are getting interested in financial markets (with bitcoin, \u201ca true, crazy mini-bubble of its own\u201d, to the fore) but not yet with the wild obsession of the frenzied dotcom years. \u201cKeep an eye on what the TVs at lunchtime eateries are showing,\u201d he says. Grantham\u2019s guess is that there is more than a 50% chance of a melt-up, or end-phase of the bubble, within the next six months to two years. If it happens, then there\u2019s a 90% probability of a melt-down, which could mean a halving of share prices from the peak. A credible theory? Well, yes, anything is possible. A year ago, when the Dow Jones industrial average passed 20,000, few thought it would hit 25,000 within 12 months \u2013 but it happened on Thursday. Is that a case of extreme euphoria, or just early signs of it? Given the impossibility of knowing, Grantham\u2019s advice to \u201cbrace yourself\u201d sounds reasonable. Brace, and keep a clear eye on the exit. Debenhams Christmas tidings not as joyful as chief predicted Eight months ago the chief executive of Debenhams, Sergio Bucher was telling investors he would make the tired-looking department store group \u201ca destination, digital and different\u201d. He didn\u2019t quite disavow discounting, but the tactic would be deployed less often and with more impact. Nice idea, shame about the results. Even before the completion of one lap of a three-year plan, Debenhams has coughed up a horrible profits warning that imperils shareholders\u2019 dividends, even if nobody is saying so yet. Profits for the full year will arrive at \u00a355m-\u00a365m. Call that a plunge of a third from last year\u2019s \u00a395m. Debenhams\u2019s Christmas grumbles sound familiar. The report was a long complaint about the \u201chighly competitive\u201d and \u201cpromotion-driven\u201d state of the market, especially on \u201cgifts\u201d, which is shorthand for everything from booze to Christmas crackers. That won\u2019t cut much ice with investors. The likes of B&amp;M, with its cheap\u2019n\u2019cheerful sheds, aren\u2019t going away. One can\u2019t, of course, judge a three-year revival plan on the basis of one bad Christmas. Equally, however, you can\u2019t blame investors for taking a gloomy view \u2013 the shares plunged 15% and Debenhams is now worth just \u00a3370m. Five years ago, the business was making \u00a3139m of pre-tax profits and the downwards trend has been consistent. Borrowings are lower than they were in the bad old days of private equity ownership, as the company keeps saying, but the current \u201cmedium-term financial leverage target\u201d is to reduce net debt to 0.5 times top-line operating profits. The new profits forecast may mean no progress whatsoever from last year\u2019s 1.3 times. That is why a dividend costing \u00a342m a year looks unsustainable \u2013 the theoretical (or imaginary) dividend yield of 11% says as much. Bucher came from Amazon, where they don\u2019t have to worry about excess store space, long leaseholds or even shareholders\u2019 dividend expectations. Good luck \u2013 this job looks much harder.",

      "bodyText": "The factory that has been making Colman\u2019s Mustard in Norwich for nearly 160 years is to close, with the loss of local jobs. Parent company Unilever said the Carrow Works site, where Colman\u2019s has been made since 1858, would shut by the end of 2019. Unilever is seeking to keep Colman\u2019s historical links with Norwich by retaining production and packing of mustard powder, the mustard milling process and mint processing at a new site in the area, in partnership with local farmers. Production of most other products, believed to be liquid condiments, will move to Burton upon Trent, the home of Marmite and Bovril. The packing of dry sauces will move to Germany. Unilever\u2019s Carrow Works factory employs 113 people. Around 40 will transfer to Burton, while the new facility near Norwich will create around 25 jobs. Unilever said a recent decision by soft-drinks maker Britvic, which co-owns the site, to close its Norwich factory, had \u201cserious implications\u201d for its business. Britvic is transferring production of Robinsons and Fruit Shoot to other UK sites, with more than 240 jobs under threat. The mustard brand has sponsored the city\u2019s football team in the past, and Norwich City fans were urged to wear a vintage Colman\u2019s sponsored Canaries shirt to a Hull city match in October in the battle to keep it in Norwich. The Unite and GMB unions said the news was \u201cdevastating\u201d and urged Unilever to reconsider its decision. Unite vowed to fight compulsory redundancies. Rebecca Long-Bailey MP, Labour\u2019s shadow business secretary, said the government \u201chadn\u2019t done anywhere near enough to stop this closure\u201d. Warren Kenny, regional secretary of the GMB union, said: \u201cThis is absolutely devastating news for the workforce at Colman\u2019s, for the city of Norwich and for manufacturing in East Anglia.\u201d",

    "webTitle": "Dow Jones and FTSE 100 hit fresh record highs as rally continues \u2013 as it happened", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "A late PS: America\u2019s stock market did indeed end the day at fresh record levels. Having burst through 25,000 at the open, the Dow Jones industrial average finished at 25,075, up 152 points. Now, as James Mackintosh of the Wall Street Journal points out, it\u2019s only a number... He\u2019s right about the Dow being imperfectly designed too -- it only contains 30 companies, so can\u2019t properly represent the US economy. Right, time for a recap. Global stock markets have romped to fresh all-time highs today as 2018 begins where 2017 left off - with shares rising across the world. A renewed burst of investor confidence swept America\u2019s Dow Jones industrial average over the 25,000 point mark for the first time - meaning it has gained around 25% in the last 12 months. Traders drove the Dow up after payroll figures showed that American companies hired 250,000 workers last month - the best reading since March. It suggests that tomorrow\u2019s US jobs report (the non-farm payroll) figures could be better than expected. Jacob Deppe, Head of Trading at online trading platform, Infinox, reckons the Dow could hit 26,000 points soon: \u201cWith the Dow Jones hitting 25,000 for the first time there seems no end in sight to a stock market rally spurred on by much stronger than expected jobs data for December, offering yet further evidence of the strength of the US economy. Most analysts had expected 190,000 jobs to have been created in the month but 250,000 jobs blew that number apart. Little wonder the Dow Jones soared to a new all time record high soon after. \u201cMarkets will expect a big number from official Non-Farm Payrolls data tomorrow, anything much less than 250,000 will be considered a disappointment. The rally gave president Trump an excuse not to think about Michael Wolff\u2019s new book; he\u2019s just claimed that the Dow could go a lot higher yet.... Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 also scaled new peaks, closing at a new all-time high. Other European stock markets also had a strong day, with the Stoxx 600 index up almost 1%. Shares jumped as new data showed that eurozone companies were growing at the fastest rate since 2011. Britain\u2019s service sector also beat expectations, although there are still signs that Brexit uncertainty is hitting investment. The rally began in Japan, where stocks jumped to their highest levels in 26 years as trading resumed after the New Year break. That\u2019s probably all for today (although I may pop back later with the close of Wall Street....) According to US reporters, Donald Trump has set the Dow Jones a new target - 30,000 points. Britain\u2019s FTSE 250 index has hit a new closing high (again) too. The index, which contains smaller companies than the FTSE 100, gained 0.37% today to close at 20,820 points. Shares in Debenhams ended the day down almost 15%, at 30.34p. That lowers its market capitalisation to just \u00a3370m, from \u00a3435m yesterday (according to my calculations anyway). The news that sales since Christmas had been disappointing obviously worried the City. Healthcare chain NMC Health was the best-performing member of the FTSE 100 today, helping to push it to new heights. But Marks &amp; Spencer dragged the index back, and was the worst-performing member (blame Debenham\u2019s profit warning). Boom! Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 has hit a new record closing high, at 7,695.88 points. The blue-chip index gained 24 points today, sending it over the previous record close - set on the final day of trading last year. At one stage, the Footsie poked its nose over over 7,700 points. The rally was led by energy stocks, miners, technology stocks and financial firms. Consumer companies lagged behind, though, following Debenham\u2019s unexpected profit warning this morning. There are just 10 minutes of the trading day left in Europe, and Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 is on track to hit a new closing high..... US president Donald Trump has welcomed today\u2019s stock market rally - along with a non-too subtle attempt to take some of the credit: Chipmaker Intel is bucking the trend, though, plunging by over 4.5% this morning. That follows the discovery of a very serious security vulnerability in its processors, which could expose many millions of people to cybercriminals. My colleague Sam Gibbs explains: The flaws, named Meltdown and Spectre, were discovered by security researchers at Google\u2019s Project Zero in conjunction with academic and industry researchersfrom several countries. Combined they affect virtually every modern computer, including smartphones, tablets and PCs from all vendors and running almost any operating system. Meltdown is \u201cprobably one of the worst CPU bugs ever found\u201d, said Daniel Gruss, one of the researchers at Graz University of Technology who discovered the flaw. Here\u2019s Sam\u2019s latest story: The Dow is continuing to hit new heights, and is now up 173 points or 0.7% at 25,097. Wall Street titans Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan are the biggest risers, both up around 2%, followed by American Express and IBM. Here\u2019s Associated Press\u2019s take on today\u2019s Wall Street action: The Dow Jones industrial average traded above 25,000 points for the first time, blasting through another 1,000-point milestone. The Dow\u2019s latest breakthrough came in early trading Thursday and just five weeks after closing above 24,000 points for the first time. Technology companies and banks had some of the biggest gains in early trading. Wells Fargo rose 1.9 percent and Microsoft rose 0.7 percent. The Standard &amp; Poor\u2019s 500 index rose 9 points, or 0.3 percent, to 2,722. The Dow Jones industrials increased 118 points, or 0.5 percent, to 25,037. The Nasdaq climbed 16 points, or 0.2 percent, to 7,081. Update: Get out the Dow 25k hats! The Dow Jones industrial average has just risen through the 25,000 point mark for the first time ever, as it keeps hitting new highs. The bull market has swept shares upwards in the last year or so - 12 months ago, the Dow was below 20k. Boom! America\u2019s stock market has hit a new alltime high at the start of trading. Although the weather is pretty awful in New York, with temperatures below freezing, the mood on Wall Street is positively fizzling. The Dow Jones industrial average has jumped by 67 points at the open, a gain of 0.27%, to 24,990 points for the first time ever. Traders are impressed by today\u2019s ADP jobs report, showing the strongest employment growth since March. Paul Ashworth of Capital Economics is also impressed by today\u2019s US jobs report. He writes: That 250,000 ADP gain, up from 185,000 in November, was probably skewed upwards by the recent strength of the official non-farm payrolls figures, however, which are used as one of the inputs. Nevertheless, after the earlier disruption caused by the hurricanes, the labour market clearly ended 2017 with some considerable momentum. Looking at the ADP details, the gains were broad-based, with the manufacturing sector adding 9,000 jobs and construction adding 16,000. Within the services sector, the 72,000 gain in professional &amp; business services was particularly encouraging, since jobs in that sector tend to be relatively well paid. Job creation is great, but where is the wage growth, analysts at Danske Bank wonder..... America\u2019s labor market got a pre-Christmas boost, according to Mark Zandi, chief economist of Moody\u2019s Analytics, (which helps produce the ADP jobs report). Zandi says: \u201cThe job market ended the year strongly,\u201d \u201cRobust Christmas sales prompted retailers and delivery services to add to their payrolls. The tight labor market will get even tighter, raising the specter that it will overheat.\u201d NEWSFLASH: America\u2019s private sector created many more jobs than expected last month, in the latest sign that the US economy is robust. US companies hired 250,000 new workers in December, according to payroll firm ADP. That\u2019s the biggest monthly increase since March, Economists had only expected an increase of 190,000; this suggests that tomorrow\u2019s non-farm payroll report (the main US employment gauge) could be strong. Service sector companies provided the bulk of the new jobs; including 72,000 new \u2018professional and business\u2019 roles. Cyprus has begun the year on an optimistic note, reports my colleague Helena Smith. Cyprus\u2019 statistics service announced that unemployment dropped by an unprecedented 15% last month reinforcing evidence that the euro zone\u2019s most easterly member state is en route to making a remarkable economic recovery following the island\u2019s near financial meltdown in 2013. 35,771 people were registered as unemployed in December, the lowest rates since December 2011, according to Cystat. The drop was attributed squarely to the construction sector which is rebounding with the recovery. Unemployment in the midst of crisis reached an all-time high of 53,204 in February 2014. In his New Year address, president Nicos Anastasiades described 2017 as \u201ca year of stability and development\u201d saying\u201d: \u201cI have no doubt that each and every one of us reasonably feel that hope is rising in our country.\u201d The leader, who is currently making the first ever visit to Saudi Arabia by a Cypriot head of state, has pledged to make sound fiscal policy a priority if he is re-elected in upcoming presidential elections. It\u2019s lunchtime! Now, for the average worker this means a quick scamper to the canteen, sandwich shop or supermarket (unless you\u2019re organised enough to bring your own provisions). But for Britain\u2019s top bosses, it means something quite different. They\u2019ve now earned the average UK annual wage since the start of 201 -- ie, in just two and a half working days. My colleague Rupert Neate explains: The chief executives of FTSE 100 companies are paid a median average of \u00a33.45m a year, which works out at 120 times the \u00a328,758 collected by full-time UK workers on average. On an hourly basis the bosses will have earned more in less than three working days than the average employee will pick up this year, leading campaigners to dub the day \u201cFat Cat Thursday\u201d. Frances O\u2019Grady, the TUC general secretary, said it was outrageous that bosses were picking up \u201csalaries that look like telephone numbers\u201d while workers were \u201csuffering the longest pay squeeze since Napoleonic times\u201d. More here: German supermarket chain Aldi had a rather better Christmas than poor old Debenhams. Strong demand for treats like mince pies, glitzy gammon joints and Irish cream liqueur helped Aldi to grow its total sales by 15% over the Christmas period. This means Aldi probably achieved \u00a310bn of sales in the UK last year, for the first time. Martin Lane, Managing Editor of money.co.uk, says Aldi\u2019s reputation for low prices and bargains means it is thriving in the current economic climate: \u201cAs a nation of shoppers, we\u2019re looking after the pound in our pocket more and more, and with their \u201cspecially selected\u201d premium items Aldi is offering the same package as the other big 4 retailers but without the expensive price tag. \u201cAldi\u2019s Specialbuys and Super 6 offers continue to make headlines and get customers through their doors and over the festive season their competitive Christmas veg prices made them a huge contender. \u201cAldi\u2019s ever-increasing popularity suggests there\u2019s no sign of a slowdown for the discount giant.\u201d Debenhams shares are still being thumped by investors. They\u2019re currently down 16% at just under 30p, down from 35.56p last night. That has knocked Debenham\u2019s market capitalisation down from \u00a3435m to just \u00a3365m - which makes Debs quite a minor player. In comparison, Marks &amp; Spencer is worth \u00a35.2bn, and Next is valued at over \u00a37bn. WH Smiths, the newsagent, has a market cap of \u00a32.5bn while Sports Direct\u2019s is \u00a32.1bn. But Debenham\u2019s plight is best illustrated with a comparison to Fever-Tree, a company founded less than 14 years ago to produce high-end tonic water and other soft drinks. It\u2019s now valued at almost \u00a32.6bn! David Madden of CMC Markets: Debenhams had a disappointing Christmas period and the retailer has issued a profit warning. The retailer cited a \u2018volatile and competitive\u2019 market for the drop in sales. Debenhams now predicts that full-year profits will be within the range of \u00a355 million to \u00a365 million, which is a considerable decline on the previous forecast of \u00a383 million. The stock has been in decline for over five years, and if this trend continues it could target 20p. Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown: \u2018Strong growth for its digital offering has failed to save Debenhams from a miserable end to the year. Customers turned out for Christmas, but refused to put their hands in their pockets in the lead up to the festive period, or indeed the Boxing Day sales. Debenhams has been forced to cut prices to persuade shoppers to part with their cash, and as a result margins have been squeezed, profits have been significantly downgraded, and the share price has taken a massive hit. Lee Wild, head of equity strategy at interactive investor: Turns out Next may have given retail sector investors a false sense of security yesterday. Debenhams brought things down to earth with a bump, warning that the fourth quarter of 2017 was bookended by weak trade and that heavy discounting has damaged margins. Getting back to Debenhams.... CEO Sergio Bucher has been speaking to reporters following this morning\u2019s profits warning. Bucher says that Debenhams will speed up its cost-cutting plans - although it\u2019s not planning to close stores (on top of the 10 already earmarked for closure) Bucher says: \u201cThere will be some jobs that will go - we\u2019ll be creating jobs as well. That\u2019s what happens when you reorganise teams.\u201d In other news, consumer credit growth in the UK has slowed - perhaps a sign that people are cutting back their spending. Annual credit growth slowed to 8.5% in the three months to November, new Bank of England figures show, down from 9.3% in the quarter to October. The pick-up in service sector growth in December suggests that Britain has shrugged off its \u2018soft patch\u2019 early last year, says Kallum Pickering of Berenberg bank. But, he still thinks it would have done better without the looming exit from the EU: The UK economy probably expanded by 1.8% yoy in 2017. While this is below the 2% annual average for the post-Lehman period, it is probably at, or even a little above, what the UK can manage on trend outside of the EU. To be fair, relative to the market\u2019s very depressed growth expectations for 2017 following the Brexit vote in 2016, the UK did much better than expected last year. That is, however, not to say that Brexit did not hurt. Growth in the US and the Eurozone, the UK\u2019s major trading partners, accelerated to well above the average of recent years. The uncertainty from Brexit prevented the UK from fully enjoying the tailwind from the synchronised global upswing. Without Brexit, the UK economy would have expanded by at least 2.5% last year. Breaking: Britain\u2019s service sector picked up pace in December, suggesting the economy is holding up well. The UK services PMI, produced by data firm Markit, has jumped to 54.2 for last month, from 53.8 in November. Any reading over 50 shows growth, and this is the second-highest score since last April. Companies reported that business activity growth picked up last month; however, new work and employment numbers rose at a slower pace. Overall, the PMI survey indicates that the UK grew at a pretty steady pace at the end of last year.... However, there are also signs that Brexit uncertainty is deterring some clients from spending money, undermining Britain\u2019s longer-term prospects, Markit\u2019s Chris Williamson explains: Digging into the details behind the resilient strength signalled by the headline numbers, the survey data reveal an economy that is beset with uncertainty about the outlook, which is in turn dampening business spending and investment. \u201cTrends in hiring and business investment in fixed assets such as offices are showing signs of deteriorating, as is expenditure on IT, computing and other business services as worries about Brexit result in delayed spending decisions. Rising price pressures are meanwhile also hurting consumer- facing companies in particular. Nearly time to discover how Britain\u2019s service sector fared last month... Breaking: Europe\u2019s companies have posted their strongest growth since 2011. The eurozone composite PMI, which measures activity across the region, jumped to 58.1 in December, up from November\u2019s 57.5. The service sector PMI rose to 56.6, up from 56.2 a month earlier. Companies reported that new orders strengthened last month, with manufacturers seeing the steepest increase in new business since 2000. This encouraged them to keep hiring more staff. Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit says the eurozone gathered momentum at the end of last year: \u201cA stellar end to 2017 for the eurozone rounded off the best year for over a decade, continuing to confound widely-held fears that rising political uncertainty would curb economic growth. At 56.4, the average PMI reading for 2017 was the highest annual trend since 2006. Manufacturing is enjoying its best growth spell since data were first collected over two decades ago while the service sector closed off its best year since 2007. \u201cThe survey data are consistent with the quarterly rate of GDP growth accelerating to an impressive 0.8% in Q4, with no sign of momentum being lost as we move into 2018. New work is flowing to companies at a rate not seen for a decade and backlogs of uncompleted work are rising sharply. Hiring is consequently at a 17-year high as firms look to boost capacity to meet rising workloads. Optimism about the outlook also turned higher in December. Debenhams\u2019 profit warning has spooked other UK retailers too. Marks &amp; Spencer are down 2.7%, the worst performer on the FTSE 100, on fears that its Christmas may have been less sparkling than hoped. Dixons Carphone have dipped too. Connor Campbell of Spreadex says Debenham is in a tough fight: After Wednesday saw Next provide its retail peers with some post-Christmas optimism, Debenhams gave the sector a reality check this Thursday as it became the first casualty of 2018. A 2.6% drop in like-for-like sales following a \u2018volatile and competitive\u2019 festive period forced the firm to issue a profit warning, with the ailing high street staple forecasting its full year figures to come in somewhere between of \u00a355m to \u00a365m, way off the \u00a383m expected by analysts. Inevitably this caused a wave of investors to jump ship, the stock plunging 20% to sub-28p \u2013 Debenhams now faces an uphill battle to avoid becoming the next BHS. Retail analyst Steve Dresser reckons Debenhams has only itself to blame, for overpricing its Christmas gift offerings... OUCH! Shares in Debenhams have plunged by 20% at the start of trading, following its shock profits warning. They tumbled from 35.6p to as low as 28p, as traders punish the company for slashing its profit forecasts this morning. Debenhams is the first UK retailer to suffer the ignominy of a post-Christmas profits warning this year, as retail analyst Nick Bubb explains: We said yesterday that there was no sign so far of anybody having to bring forward their scheduled Christmas trading announcements from next week\u2026but poor old Debenhams has stepped up to the plate today, to warn that weak gross margins (-150 bps) and a poor Sale last week have hit the bottom-line. Full-year profits (to end August) are likely to be down to \u00a355m-65m, versus a modest consensus forecast of about \u00a383m, despite finding an extra \u00a310m of cost savings... Sergio Bucher, the new CEO of Debenhams, wails: \u201cThe market has been challenging and particularly promotional in some of our key seasonal categories and we have responded in order to remain competitive for our customers, which has impacted our profit performance\u201d. Newsflash: Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 has hit a fresh record high at the start of trading. The blue-chip index rose by 27 points to 7,698 points, just over the previous record set on the final trading session of 2017. That follows the rally in Japan this morning, and last night\u2019s record close on Wall Street. High street retailer Debenhams has sent a shiver through the City this morning, reports my colleague Angela Monaghan: Debenhams has issued a surprise profits warning after a disappointing festive season and a failure to entice shoppers despite heavy discounting in the post- Christmas sales period. The department store chain struck a gloomy tone as it brought forward by a week its Christmas trading update to warn the current UK trading environment was \u201cvolatile and highly competitive with weaker demand in some more discretionary areas\u201d. Debenhams said profits for the full year were now likely to be in the range of \u00a355m to \u00a365m, sharply below the \u00a383m expected by the City. \u201cWe took tactical promotional action to improve our performance which resulted in a stronger 6 week Christmas period against tough comparatives... However, the first week of post-Christmas sale was below expectations despite further markdown investment, particularly in the highly seasonal gift category,\u201d the retailer said. Like-for-like sales in the UK - which strip out the impact of sales at stores open for less than a year - fell 2.6% in the 17 weeks to 30 December. Like-for-like sales overall were down 1.8%. Sergio Bucher, chief executive of the retailer, said: \u201cThe market has been challenging and particularly promotional in some of our key seasonal categories and we have responded in order to remain competitive for our customers, which has impacted our profit performance. Just in: London was the worst-performing part of the UK property sector last year, according to the Nationwide building society. The average house price in the capital fell by 0.5% during 2017, Nationwide reports, while the UK average rose by 2.6%. Robert Gardner, Nationwide\u2019s Chief Economist, says mounting pressure on household incomes held house price growth back (good news if you\u2019re tying to get onto the housing ladder). Gardner adds: \u201cThe significant disparity in house prices across the UK has been a recurring theme in recent years. In this respect, 2017 saw the beginnings of a shift, as rates of house price growth in the south of England moderated towards those prevailing in the rest of the country. \u201cLondon saw a particularly marked slowdown, with prices falling in annual terms for the first time in eight years, albeit by a modest 0.5%. London ended the year the weakest performing region for the first time since 2004. But despite this slowdown, the average London house still costs over \u00a3470k -- or more than double the national average.... Investors \u2018flocked\u2019 to the Japanese stock market today to buy shares, says Japan Today, driven by expectations that the markets will rally in 2018. It reports: The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average ended up 741.39 points, or 3.26%, from Friday at 23,506.33, its highest close since Jan 7, 1992. The broader Topix index of all First Section issues on the Tokyo Stock Exchange finished 46.26 points, or 2.55%, higher at 1,863.82. Tokyo markets were closed from Monday to Wednesday for the New Year holidays. The Nikkei posted the largest daily gain since November 2016 as every industry category on the main section gained ground, led by oil and coal product, securities and electric appliance issues. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. World stock markets have started the new year in good heart, on hopes that economic growth will be robust this year. Over in Tokyo, Japan\u2019s stock market has surged by over 3% to close at its highest level in 26 years, on the first trading day of the year. Energy and financials stocks led the rally. Traders were in good spirits after the US stock markets closed at (yet another) record high last night, showing that the bull market still has legs. Optimism was also boosted by new data showing that Japan and China\u2019s service sectors both performed well in December, with growth accelerating. Jasper Lawler of London Capital Group says: Japanese stocks returned from holiday trading with a bang. The Topix index struck a 26 year, tracking the optimism that\u2019s seen Wall Street close at record highs in the past two trading sessions. The energy sector was leading the charge in Asia after oil prices climbed again. At the same time activity in Japan\u2019s manufacturing sector rose to a 4 year high according to survey data. Later this morning we get service sector reports from the UK and the eurozone, which will probably confirm that Europe\u2019s economy ended 2017 strongly. We also get a fresh healthcheck on Britain\u2019s property market, with new house price figures from Nationwide and the latest mortgage approvals numbers. Plus, we\u2019ll be tracking the UK retail sector, as high street retailer Debenhams has just released a profits warning! That\u2019s a blow, a day after Next surprised the City with decent-looking results yesterday. Here\u2019s the agenda: 7am GMT: Nationwide house price survey for December 9am GMT: Eurozone service sector PMI for December 9.30am GMT: UK service sector PMI for December 9.30am GMT: UK mortgage approvals and consumer credit data 1.30pm GMT: US initial jobless figures",

      "bodyText": "Britain\u2019s services sector, including hotels and banks, grew at a faster rate than expected last month, setting the economy on course for its strongest quarter in 2017 despite mounting fears over the challenges ahead from Brexit. Households defied the biggest squeeze on living standards in memory to help spur the growth in service sector activity in December, while optimism reached a seven-month high. Still, there were worrying signals for the months ahead as firms reported the slowest growth rate since August 2016. The main reading on the Markit/CIPS UK Services PMI confounded economists\u2019 expectations of a slowdown, increasing to 54.2 in December from 53.8 a month earlier. Economists had forecast 53.8 on a scale where anything above 50 indicates expansion. Alongside solid readings from the smaller manufacturing and construction sectors, the report from Britain\u2019s dominant services industry suggested economic growth of between 0.4% and 0.5% in the final three months of 2017, according to the IHS Markit chief economist, Chris Williamson. That would be the strongest quarter of growth in the UK economy last year. The services sector encompasses transport, communications, finance, business and personal services, computing and IT, and hotels and restaurants. Economists had expected the overall UK growth rate for 2017 to be about 1.5% \u2013 which is 0.3 percentage points lower than the level in 2016 because of the cost-of-living squeeze on households denting consumer spending. The rate of growth is then forecast to fall closer to 1% in 2018 as talks to leave the EU intensify. Kallum Pickering, senior UK economist at the City bank Berenberg, said the economy could have grown at a rate of about 2.5% last year if there had not been a vote to leave the EU in 2016. \u201cThe uncertainty from Brexit prevented the UK from fully enjoying the tailwind from the synchronised global upswing [for economic growth],\u201d he added. Although the PMI figures give a broadly positive reading on the health of the economy at the end of 2017, there were some signs of underlying weakness. As well as growing at the slowest rate since August 2016, services firms said Brexit-related uncertainty was holding back the willingness of their clients to spend. The rate of employment growth also eased to a nine-month low. Businesses were paying more for food, fuel and higher salaries, as they try to keep hold of staff at a time when unemployment is at a record low. To balance the books, firms increased the prices they charge customers, which could intensify the squeeze on disposable income. The signals will encourage the Bank of England, which is looking for signs of pay growth in order to justify raising interest rates again this year. Threadneedle Street increased the cost of borrowing from 0.25% to 0.5% in the first interest rate hike in a decade in November. It said it would need to raise the rate further to peg back inflation. \u2022 Follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk, or sign up to the daily Business Today email here.",

      "bodyText": "Aldi is increasing pay for store staff after it enjoyed a bumper Christmas with sales up 15% in December. The German grocer said its sales in the UK and Ireland would exceed \u00a310bn for the first time in 2017, after it opened a further 76 stores, taking its total to 762. Sales growth was driven by a 30% surge in Aldi\u2019s premium Specially Selected ranges during December compared with the same month in 2016. Mince pies, sweetcured gammon joints topped with a gingerbread crumb, Aberdeen Angus beef roasting joints and Irish cream liqueur all sold well. Matthew Barnes, chief executive officer of Aldi UK and Ireland, said: \u201cThis was our busiest-ever Christmas as millions of festive shoppers switched to Aldi from more expensive food retailers. \u201cAlthough we saw strong growth across all categories, the performance of our premium Specially Selected range in particular surpassed all expectations.\u201d Aldi said it was increasing the minimum hourly rate of pay for store assistants to \u00a38.85 nationally, a 3.75% rise, and to \u00a310.20 in London, a 4.6% boost, from 1 February. The company, which also pays employees for breaks unlike some chains, claimed it was reaffirming its position as the UK\u2019s highest-paying supermarket. The rates match the independently verified living wage recommended by the Living Wage Foundation, although Aldi is not formally accredited to the scheme as not all its workers are guaranteed the rate as a minimum. Aldi\u2019s performance suggests another strong year for the discounters, putting further pressure on the major supermarkets. Bruno Monteyne, an analyst at Bernstein Research, said 10% of Aldi\u2019s growth came from new store launches and a further 2.5% was the result of price inflation. He said Aldi\u2019s profit margins were likely to come under pressure as chains such as Tesco, Sainsbury\u2019s and Asda reduced prices amid rising costs. Convenience stores are also thought to have taken business from the supermarkets towards the end of 2017, partly because they benefited from being allowed to open for longer on Sundays, including Christmas Eve. Grocery wholesaler Nisa, which serves thousands of independent corner shops, said its sales had risen 1.7% at established stores in the 10 weeks to New Year\u2019s Eve. The Co-op\u2019s sales rose 6.2% at established stores in the two weeks to 1 January. \u2022 Follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk, or sign up to the daily Business Today email here.",

      "bodyText": "UK house prices increased just 2.6% in 2017 while prices in London fell for the first time in eight years, according to the leading mortgage lender Nationwide. This followed an increase of 4.5% in 2016 and was the slowest rate of annual growth since 2012, as households constrained by falling real pay grew increasingly reluctant to commit to major spending decisions. Nationwide said price growth was likely to slow further in 2018, to around 1-1.5%, against a backdrop of subdued economic growth and continued pressure on family finances. The average price of a UK home was \u00a3211,156 in December, when prices rose by 0.6% over the month. Prices in London fell by 0.5% last year, making the capital the weakest performing region for the first time since 2004, as more buyers were unable to afford to buy a home in the capital. \u201cIn London and the south-east, affordability has become even more challenging, with more people priced out of the market or needing to borrow a greater multiple of their income,\u201d said Robert Gardner, Nationwide\u2019s chief economist. Gardner said it would take a typical buyer nearly 10 years to save for a deposit to buy a home in London, with the average price of a property at \u00a3470,922 at the end of last year. Prices rose in every UK region apart from London in 2017. The biggest riser was the West Midlands, where average prices rose by 5.2% to \u00a3182,861. It was followed by the south-west, where prices increased by 4.8% to \u00a3239,576. Nationwide said low mortgage rates, high employment levels and a shortage of properties on the market had prevented a bigger slowdown in UK house price growth in 2017. The lender said the outlook for the housing market in the year ahead was uncertain and highly dependent on the outcome of Brexit talks and the UK\u2019s economic performance overall. \u201cHow the housing market performs in 2018 will be determined in large part by developments in the wider economy. Brexit developments will remain important, though these remain hard to foresee,\u201d Gardner said. \u201cThe UK housing market has been characterised by significant regional disparities in house prices in recent years and it is not clear how Brexit will impact these dynamics.\u201d Howard Archer, chief economic adviser to the EY Item Club forecasting group, said 2018 would be \u201ca very challenging year\u201d for the housing market, partly because buyers would be concerned about the potential for higher mortgage costs, after the Bank of England raised interest rates for the first time in a decade in November and indicated that further increases were likely. \u201cHousing market activity remains under pressure from squeezed consumer purchasing power, fragile confidence and caution over engaging in major transactions,\u201d Archer said. \u201cPotential house buyers are also likely concerned about the possibility of further interest rate hikes in 2018 following November\u2019s increase. We see house prices rising by a modest 2% in 2018.\u201d Household finances have come under renewed pressure since the Brexit vote, which drove a sharp fall in the value of the pound and pushed up the price of goods imported from abroad. That in turn has pushed up inflation, currently running at 3.1%, which is well ahead of the Bank of England\u2019s 2% target and above current pay growth of 2.3%, signalling a fall in real pay. The Mortgage Advice Bureau said the housing market in 2018 was likely to be similar to the market in 2017, with first-time buyers \u2013 particularly in London \u2013 struggling to get on the housing ladder. It expects regional variations to continue this year, with prices rising faster in some areas than others over the next 12 months. Nationwide said the variation in regional affordability had increased in the past decade. Affordability improved in Wales, Scotland and the north of England, but the biggest improvement was in Northern Ireland following the sharp fall in house prices, which are still around 40% lower than they were in 2007, before the financial crisis took hold. Prices in London however are 55% above their 2007 peak, while those in the north and Yorkshire and Humberside are still lower than they were in 2007. Alex Gosling, founder of the online estate agents HouseSimple.com, said UK house price growth of 2.6% in 2017 showed the housing market was \u201cfundamentally in a very healthy state\u201d. \u201cConsidering that Brexit doom-mongers predicted that property prices would plummet after the Brexit vote and article 50 being invoked, the housing market has proved surprisingly resilient in 2017,\u201d he added. \u201cThe major surprise was undoubtedly the slowdown in London house prices. It\u2019s been 13 years since the capital sat at the bottom of the house price growth table, and since then we have seen prices surge to unprecedented and unaffordable levels.\u201d \u2022 Follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk, or sign up to the daily Business Today email here.",

      "bodyText": "Debenhams shares have plunged 20% after the store chain issued an unexpected profits warning after poor festive sales and a failure to entice shoppers to its post-Christmas sale. The department store struck a gloomy tone as it brought forward its Christmas trading update by a week. It also warned that the current UK trading environment was \u201cvolatile and highly competitive\u201d. Debenhams said profits for the full year were now expected to be between \u00a355m and \u00a365m \u2013 sharply below City expectations of \u00a383m. The share price plunge wiped almost \u00a370m off the market value of the Debenhams business. The chain, which is now planning to bring forward job cuts, is now valued at \u00a3365m. \u201cWe took tactical promotional action to improve our performance which resulted in a stronger six-week Christmas period against tough comparatives \u2026 However, the first week of post-Christmas sale was below expectations despite further markdown investment, particularly in the highly seasonal gift category,\u201d the retailer said. Like-for-like sales in the UK, which strip out the impact of sales at stores open for less than a year, fell 2.6% in the 17 weeks to 30 December. Like-for-like sales overall were down 1.8%. Sergio Bucher, Debenhams\u2019 chief executive, said the company was accelerating plans to cut jobs by simplifying its management structures. It will also be stepping up business rates reviews as part of aims to save an extra \u00a310m in costs this year. The company is already closing two stores and considering shuttering up to eight more as part of Bucher\u2019s recovery plan announced earlier this year. The company said it continued to keep its estate under review. Bucher said he had faith in his turnaround plan and remained \u201coptimistic about the future of Debenhams\u201d, saying the company had increased sales of beauty and food but had failed to make its gifts innovative or premium enough to fend off heavy competition and discounting. He said Debenhams had held market share in clothing but the market had shrunk amid a warm start to the season, which had led to more discounting than last year. \u201cThe market has been challenging and particularly promotional in some of our key seasonal categories and we have responded in order to remain competitive for our customers, which has impacted our profit performance,\u201d Bucher said. \u201cNevertheless, we are seeing positive early signs from the changes we have made as part of our Debenhams Redesigned strategy. The market dynamics we have seen have reinforced our view that we need to move even faster to implement the cultural and organisational changes needed to ensure Debenhams is in the best possible shape for today\u2019s fast-changing retail environment.\u201d The gloomy Christmas trading update from Debenhams contrasts with an update on Wednesday from Next, which revealed a better than expected Christmas, as strong online sales more than offset grim trading at its high street stores. Analysts were divided over which retailer provided the better indicator of conditions on the high street. But Richard Chamberlain, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets, said Debenhams\u2019 problems were not only the result of challenging market conditions and a tough post-Christmas sale. \u201cIn addition we think Debenhams has suffered from having a sub-optimal clothing and gifts offer and from being overly reliant on promotional activity to drive footfall and online spend,\u201d he said. \u2022 Follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk, or sign up to the daily Business Today email here.",

      "bodyText": "Bosses of top British companies will have made more money by lunchtime on Thursday than the average UK worker will earn in the entire year, according to an independent analysis of the vast gap in pay between chief executives and everyone else. The chief executives of FTSE 100 companies are paid a median average of \u00a33.45m a year, which works out at 120 times the \u00a328,758 collected by full-time UK workers on average. On an hourly basis the bosses will have earned more in less than three working days than the average employee will pick up this year, leading campaigners to dub the day \u201cFat Cat Thursday\u201d. Frances O\u2019Grady, the TUC general secretary, said it was outrageous that bosses were picking up \u201csalaries that look like telephone numbers\u201d while workers were \u201csuffering the longest pay squeeze since Napoleonic times\u201d. The analysis by the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development (CIPD) and the High Pay Centre shows chief executives of FTSE 100 companies are paid an average of \u00a3898 per hour \u2013 256 times what apprentices earn on the minimum wage. Tim Roache, the general secretary of the GMB union, said the pay gap between bosses and workers was \u201csimply obscene\u201d. \u201cDoes anyone really think these fat cats deserve 100 times more than the hard-working people who prop up their business empires?\u201d he said. \u201cWorkers who have to scrimp and save to feed their families and put a roof over their head \u2013 and like most of Britain\u2019s working population will now be feeling the pinch after the festive period?\u201d Roache said the prime minister had failed in her promise to tackle excessive executive pay: \u201cLast year Theresa May broke her pledge to guarantee worker representation on company boards, a move which would have helped shed light on corporate excess and redress the balance towards fairer pay.\u201d O\u2019Grady agreed that workers should be given seats on pay committees to \u201cbring some common sense and fairness to boardroom pay\u201d, and called on the minimum wage to be lifted to \u00a310 an hour. The minimum wage for over-25s is set to rise from \u00a37.50 to \u00a37.83 on 1 April. Under-18s can be paid as little as \u00a34.05 and apprentices \u00a33.50. The highest paid chief executive in the analysis, which is based on 2016 figures, was Sir Martin Sorrell, who was paid \u00a348m by advertising firm WPP. In 2015 WPP paid Sorrell \u00a370m. His reduced pay helped bring down the FTSE 100 chief executives\u2019 mean pay packages from \u00a35.4m in 2015 to \u00a34.5m in 2016. The title for the highest paid listed company boss this year is almost certain to be Jeff Fairburn, the chief executive of housebuilder Persimmon, who is on track to collect a \u00a3110m bonus. Stefan Stern, the director of the High Pay Centre thinktank, said it was encouraging that remuneration committees had exercised \u201ca tiny amount of restraint\u201d on pay last year. \u201c[But] there are still grossly excessive and unjustifiable gaps between the top and rest of the workforce,\u201d he said. Stern said the gap between bosses and workers pay had more than tripled in 20 years. Peter Cheese, the chief executive of the CIPD, said the nation needed a \u201csignificant rethink on how and why we reward CEOs\u201d. Cheese said bosses pay awards should more widely reflect the impacts of businesses on all stakeholders from employees to society more broadly. Labour said the figures demonstrated how out of control inequality in Britain had become. Rebecca Long-Bailey, the shadow business secretary, said: \u201cThe next Labour government will tackle rampant pay inequality with a real living wage of at least \u00a310 per hour, with an excessive pay levy and by rolling out maximum pay ratios of 20:1 in the public sector and in companies bidding for public contracts.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 5 January 2018. An earlier version referred to Sorrell\u2019s reduced pay lowering median pay packages where the mean was meant.",
